they lie about the faults or shortcomings of the leader or leaders,

<p>
The cult has no respect for the historical truth. Like a Communist country that
changes the history books every time a new dictator takes over, evil
cults revise their history whenever it suits them. The cult won't
allow mere facts to hinder it in its pursuit of wealth and power.
<p>
Speaking of Communists, two of the most famous and notorious
examples of rewriting history were the regimes of Joseph Stalin
and Chairman Mao Tse Tung.
Both of their regimes were <i>non-religious</i> cults built
around the personality of the leader.
Both of those leaders had their own ideas of history, and what
had happened, or what they wished had happened.
Both of them tended to &quot;re-educate&quot; people who
remembered the wrong things, and the re-education took place
in horrendous gulags in Siberia, or communal farms in rural
China, where death was common as dirt.
<p>
Stalin's agents even went into libraries, and cut
pages out of books, and glued in new pages, to change history.
And Stalin's enemies had a funny habit of getting air-brushed
out of old photographs...
Stalin's boys even invented the Orwellian term
&quot;non-person&quot;, which is what somebody whom Stalin
disliked turned into... Those &quot;non-persons&quot; didn't do
anything wrong. They weren't killed on Stalin's orders. They simply
never existed in the first place.
<p>
A little closer to home, Jehovah's Witnesses will deny that
they ever believed that Armageddon would come in 1975 &#8212; even
those people who sold their homes or delayed getting medical
treatment didn't ever believe it. They didn't gather on
hilltops waiting for the Lord to come. It *did* *not* happen.

<p>
<a name="Scientology_falsification"> </a>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
Scientology provides us with plenty of outrageous examples of falsification
of history, particularly the history of the founder Lafayette Ronald (&quot;L. Ron&quot;)
Hubbard. Scientology propaganda tells us things like that young Hubbard was in China
and Tibet in 1927, instructing oriental sages in the wisdom of the ancients, when he
was actually just another unspectacular high school student in the USA.
And then they tell us that he was a great naval commander and war hero in
World War II, but his contemporaries tell us that he was the commander of
a barge for a very short time, where he blasted away at the empty ocean
with a deck gun, insisting that he was shooting at a submarine that no one else
could see. One of his commanders wrote in his competency report,
&quot;Under no conditions should Hubbard be given command of a
ship.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
But books published by the Scientology organization still tell us that
L. Ron Hubbard was a brave war hero.

<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
And Frank Buchman's <i>Oxford Group</i> cult was good at rewriting
history, too.
Buchman was notorious for admiring and
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler" target="_blank">praising Adolf Hitler</a>
before World War II:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;.
</font>
Frank Buchman also repeatedly declared that he
wanted everyone to live under a
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Christian Fascist dictatorship&quot;</font>, and
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;the dictatorship of the living spirit of God&quot;</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;the true dictatorship of the living God&quot;</font>.
<p>
But after World War II, they totally changed their story.
Garth Lean's obsequious biography of Frank Buchman,
<a href="orange-rroot930.html#Garth_Lean" target="_blank"><i>On The Tail Of
A Comet</i></a>, contains two chapters about the years before
World War II, called
<i>&quot;Awakening Democracy&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;America
Has No Sense of Danger&quot;</i>, where he explains that Frank Buchman
had always been a super-patriot who opposed fascism
and Adolf Hitler &#8212; that Buchman was a prescient moral leader who
struggled to awaken a stupid, complacent America to the imminent dangers
posed by the rising tide of fascism...
<p>
Likewise, Frank Buchman's
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9" target="_blank">fascist disciple
Peter Howard</a>, who became the leader of Buchman's organization after
Buchman's death, was a member of
Sir Oswald Mosley's <i>New Party</i>, which morphed into the
<i>British Union of Fascists</i>, and Howard bragged about street fighting
against the leftists in Britain. Peter Howard was also the leader of Mosley's
<i>New Youth Movement</i> &#8212;
Oswald Mosley's copy of the <i>Hitlerjugend</i> (Hitler Youth) organization.
But in 1941, when Britain was at war with Germany, Howard wrote in
<i>Innocent Men</i>, his
book of praise of Frank Buchman, that he, Howard, had only been a follower of
Mosley for a few months, and that he was always strongly opposed to
fascism.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

Different Levels of Truth.</b></font><br>
Some pieces of information, or &quot;truths&quot;, are given to outsiders,
but others are only revealed to insiders. Likewise, the beginners
and the guru's inner circle get different
&quot;truths&quot;. Some items of information are only accessible to
the innermost circle.
<p>

<a name="Scientology_levels_of_truth"> </a>
Ken Ragge said it well:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All cults have different levels of truth. &quot;Outsider doctrine&quot; refers
to information and &quot;truths&quot; which are told to the general public.
Complementary to this &quot;outsider doctrine&quot; is &quot;insider doctrine&quot; which is
revealed to members alone and then usually only gradually as they attain
status. For example, the outsider doctrine of the Scientologists is that
their organization works for mental health and human potential. The
insider doctrine includes belief in past lives on other planets and
other unusual beliefs. The reason for this separation of doctrine in
cults is that it would be impossible to recruit if people knew what the
organization really was about.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Real AA</i>, Ken Ragge</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ken Ragge just left out some of the most extreme (and entertaining) stuff:
Scientology also says
that you can be harmed by memories of injuries (engrams) that you
received millions of years ago, in <i>really distant</i> previous
lifetimes on other planets. And Scientology says that you can be
inhabited and hurt by &quot;body thetans&quot; and &quot;clusters&quot;,
which are the spirits, or clusters of spirits, of aliens who
were murdered 60 million years ago in a huge purge of the excess
population of a remote over-crowded planet, by the nasty Galactic Overlord Xenu.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Yes, boys and girls, it's <b>The Attack of The Interplanetary Cooties!</b></i>
</font>
<p>
Furthermore, if you are really a competent, functioning, intelligent being,
you should be immortal and have great mind-over-matter powers.
It is called being an Operating Thetan.
Getting injured, getting sick, and even dying are
all considered evidence that you are just being lazy and immoral.
<p>
One test of competency is the Ash Tray Test: You go into a room where there
is nothing but a table and a few chairs, and an ash tray on the table.
You do not leave the room until you levitate the ash tray with your mental
powers. Should you fail to do that, it proves that you are immoral, damaged, and
non-functional, and need to pay Scientology lots more money and take more
Scientology courses for some more &quot;self-improvement.&quot;
<p>
Is that nutty enough for you? Obviously, that isn't the kind of stuff
that they tell the prospective new members out on the street.
Like Ragge said, the newcomers are only told that the Scientology organization
works for improved mental health and increased human potential by
clearing out harmful engrams.

In speaking about patterns of cult behavior in many of our government
institutions, Dr. Arthur Deikman wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Secrecy supports cult-like behavior, as we saw in the Life Force
group, where the hierarchy was
maintained through limiting access to information. Secrecy functions
not only to cover up unethical activities from outside eyes, but
also to increase authoritarian control over the larger group. By
promoting the idea that the leader or the in-group have special information
and expertise, they remove themselves from criticism and justify
the exclusion of others from the decision-making process.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the case of religious cults the special information and expertise
is described as divine inspiration or enlightenment. The cult leader's
presumed higher state precludes lower beings from judging his or her
actions. Similar claims are made in government where special
knowledge of the enemy or secret technical information is said to
justify decisions that would otherwise be objected to on moral or
even practical grounds.<br>

Newcomers can't think right.</b></font><br>
<i>The elder cult members believe that prospects and new converts are
incapable of exercising good judgement.</i><br>

Since newcomers can't make good decisions, the cult
must do the thinking for the newcomers, for their own good.
<p>
<a name="Scientology_newcomers_mentally_defective"> </a>
The reasons that the cults give to explain the newcomers' mental
handicaps vary from one cult to another.
<ul>
<li>
Some cults will say that the newcomers have not been exposed to enough Holy
teachings to overcome the evil influences of Satan.
<li>
Others will say that they haven't progressed spiritually enough,
or that they haven't prayed enough,
or that they haven't learned enough to know the Truth, yet.
<li>
Other cults will declare that the newcomer has not yet done
enough meditation, chanting, or yoga to have a clear mind.
<li>
Recovery- and psychotherapy-oriented organizations
claim that newcomers have not yet recovered enough to have
sane, clear minds. Scientology calls them
&quot;pre-clears&quot; because they haven't bought enough courses
of &quot;auditing&quot; to fix their minds and become &quot;clear&quot;.
<li>
The previous item,
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_levels_of_truth" target="_blank"><i>Different Levels of Truth</i></a>,
provides another reason to believe that newcomers can't think right: They haven't been
told the important information, so they can't make informed decisions.
</ul>

<p>
In most cases, the elder cult members believe that withholding
the truth from newcomers is occasionally justified, necessary, and
appropriate.
The elders believe that they are justified in practicing
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>
to get new people to join their group, precisely because the newcomers
cannot think correctly, so it doesn't really matter what the newcomers
are told, or what they think, anyway.<br>

Steve Hassan reports in his book <i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i>
that he was repeatedly deceived and lied to while he was recruited by
Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, and they rationalized it this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When I asked a member why I hadn't been told the truth about the
religious quality of the movement, he asked, &quot;If you knew in
advance, would you have come?&quot;
I admitted that I probably wouldn't have. He explained that the
world was controlled by Satan after he had deceived Adam and Eve into
disobeying God. Now God's children had to deceive Satan's children into
following God's will. He said, &quot;Stop thinking from fallen man's
viewpoint. Think about God's viewpoint. He wants to see his creation
restored to His original ideal &#8212; the Garden of Eden. That's all that
matters!&quot; Later, it became evident that this &quot;heavenly
deception&quot; was used in all aspects of the organization &#8212;
recruiting, fundraising, public relations. Since members are so
focused on meeting their assigned goals, there is no room for &quot;the
old morality.&quot; The group even uses the Bible to &quot;show&quot;
that God condoned deception several times in history in order to
see His plan accomplished. By accepting the way in which I was deceived,
I set myself up to begin deceiving others.<br>

Meanwhile, over in Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard was saying that
<blockquote>

&quot;... new followers or potential converts should not be exposed
to [the language and cosmology of the group] at too early a stage.

<p>
In the Oxford Group, Dr. Frank Buchman declared that beginners could not hear the
Voice of God correctly in their &quot;Quiet Times&quot;, because they had not confessed
enough, and prayed enough, and they had not totally &quot;surrendered to God&quot;
yet, so the newcomers were required to always submit their received &quot;messages from
God&quot; to the elder cult members for review and approval. Those elders would then
tell the new members what God really said and what God really wanted people to do.
(Notice how that policy changed &quot;Hear the Voice of God and obey God&quot;
into &quot;Hear the cult elders and obey the cult elders&quot;.)

Dr. Marlene Winell is a psychiatrist who treats people who have been traumatized by fundamentalist
religions. The web site &quot;The Freethought Police&quot; (TFP) interviewed her, and asked about
people leaving fundamentalist religions:
<p>
<blockquote>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>TFP:</strong>&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; Say

want to leave.&nbsp; What kind of message of hope can you give to
someone trying to overcome indoctrination?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>DMW:</strong>&nbsp; Well, many
people have done that.&nbsp; It's possible.&nbsp; It's not your
fault.&nbsp; It's a little bit like domestic violence: the person who
thinks its her fault and she keeps going back and why doesn't she just
leave?&nbsp; Well, it's very difficult, but people do leave.&nbsp; And
just because you've been told, over and over, that if you leave terrible
 things will happen, that you'll die, that's not true.&nbsp; Because,
it's not so much that you'll go to Hell when you die, but that terrible
things will happen right now.&nbsp; That you'll go crazy.&nbsp; You'll
become addicted to drugs.&nbsp; You'll become a criminal.&nbsp; That
you'll become depressed.&nbsp; All sorts of things.&nbsp; Your life will
 be terrible if you leave the faith, if you leave the fold. If you leave
 this group.&nbsp; The world is a bad place.&nbsp; People are bad and
it's the domain of Satan.&nbsp; So, you're very reckless to leave.&nbsp;

<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB">Steve Hassan</a> lists numerous
Physical, Psychological, Spiritual and Social fears

For just a few examples, cult members fear that if they leave the cult they will:
<ul>
<li> die painfully or violently.
<li> become an alcoholic or drug addict.
<li> go insane.
<li> be a failure.
<li> lose control completely.
<li> lose their dreams.
<li> lose all hope of a happy future.
<li> become unspiritual.
<li> lose their relationship with God.
<li> be defeated by Satan.
<li> be possessed by demons or evil spirits.
<li> lose their chance for immortality or salvation.
<li> be judged unworthy when Armageddon takes place.
<li> not be taken up to Heaven when the Rapture happens.
<li> be unloved.
<li> be ostracized and rejected by the group. <font color="#9F0000">(This threat is real.)</font>
<li> be abandoned.

The Group is Money-Grubbing.</b></font><br>
<i>The cult is preoccupied with fund-raising.</i><br>
This is simple. The cult is just always scheming to make more money,
one way or another, either from cult members or from outsiders,
and often, from both.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Often, cult members are required to buy books written by
the cult leader.
Most every sect has some kind of holy scriptures or documents.
The Hari Krishnas (ISKCON) have many books written by
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
Prabhupada, and the Scientologists have <i>many dozens</i> of books by
L. Ron Hubbard to buy...

<p>
<li> Often, the cult members spend a lot of their time selling something,
or collecting donations, or working at a cult-owned business.
Cults are also often dishonest and deceptive in how they get money.

<p>
<a name="sankirtan"> </a>
<li> The Hari Krishnas (ISKCON) want to sell you books, and then
short-change you.
They rationalize their actions by saying that it is all God's money anyway,
so it's okay if they steal it from you and give it to their guru.
Nori Muster described <i>sankirtan</i> (fund-raising) activities this
way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Women also did traveling <i>sankirtan</i>, but the ones I knew generally
stayed at the temple to work Los Angeles International Airport,
conveniently just fifteen minutes from the temple. Some women agonized
over their quotas. For others, talking to people and selling things
came naturally. There was also an element of deception in some of the
transactions; it was called the &quot;change up.&quot;
In the change-up routine a <i>sankirtan</i> woman might pin a paper
flower on a man's lapel and say, &quot;Hi, sir, I'm giving a
flower to all the cutest guys in the airport.&quot; Then she might say,
&quot;Can you please give a donation to print educational books for
college students?
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank">Everyone's helping out today</a>.&quot;
If the man opened his wallet to reveal large bills, the devotee might
say, &quot;Oh, sir, I've been collecting all day and I have so many
dollar bills I feel like a walking salad bowl. I could change a
hundred.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If the man pulled out the bill, the devotee added it to her collection
and then started counting back change, slowly. &quot;Five, six, seven,
eight, nine. Sir, could you give the rest in charity? It will come
back to you a thousandfold.&quot;
At the L.A. temple, change-up techniques were exchanged in the ashram
and demonstrated to all <i>sankirtan</i> devotees in a presentation
in the temple room. The technique slipped out to other temples,
as well.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Even though the L.A. women's team brought in $20,000 a week, they had
no real power. Women couldn't make decisions for the organization or
hold any rank. They could be mistreated unless a male sympathizer acted
as an advocate.<br>

<p>
ISKCON even got involved in drug-running and money-laundering to bring
in cash:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
His [Rishabdev's] service in ISKCON was to cultivate &quot;congregational
members&quot; and get them to give large cash donations to the BBT.
He had received encouragement from above, even though his flock
happened to include international drug smugglers from the Brotherhood
of Eternal Love.
The Brotherhood had roots in Eastern spirituality and was associated
with Timothy Leary when LSD first became popular during the early
1960s. The Brotherhood tried to instill Eastern philosophy along with
the psychedelic drugs its members manufactured and marketed.
One former Brotherhood follower joined ISKCON
and eventually became one of the eleven gurus. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; These
congregational members gave generously to the ISKCON mission,
and Rishabdev welcomed their donations with an open heart.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Devotees seeking private support for their projects flocked to
Laguna Beach for the abundant cash that seemed to circulate there.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Rishabdev, the link between ISKCON and the Brotherhood, made the
necessary introductions for those who wanted to become smugglers.
Despite the moral questions involved in such practices, some devotees
willingly risked their freedom for the promise of quick financial
independence and the ability to support chosen projects. New
couriers had their photos taken with Dridha-vrata, the ringleader,
and the photos became their identification cards for the hash oil
connection in Pakistan. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Their &quot;service&quot; was confidential, of course, because

<li> The Moonies want to sell you books and flowers, and they also have
a scam where church members must buy expensive trinkets from
the church to comfort their unhappy dead ancestors.
The cult also demands that members surrender all of their worldly
wealth to the church &#8212; just hand over your checkbook and credit
cards. Really. Literally.

<p>
<li> Maharishi Mahesh Yogi sold people
words to chant while doing Transcendental Meditation
(<i>&quot;mantras&quot;</i>) because &quot;Americans are so
materialistic that they wouldn't value the words if they got
them for free.&quot; (I love that:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;You American kids are too materialistic,
so give me all of your money.&quot;</i></font>)
Then Maharishi got into the business of selling his students
&quot;flying lessons&quot; &#8212; lessons that ostensibly taught
the art of levitation. Rumor has it that students who were having
trouble flying were taught to bounce up and down on a cushion
to get started... It seems that they were working on their hang
time even before Michael Jordan popularized the skill.

<p>
<li> Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh had 93 Rolls Royces as well as
countless millions of dollars in cash and other trinkets because he
convinced his followers that they should show their love and devotion
to him by buying him more and more expensive gifts.

We were just talking about Scientology. They <i>always</i> want to
sell you something, either a book, or an overpriced E-meter,
or more auditing,
or another horrendously overpriced &quot;course&quot; &#8212; or a dozen of
them, for another $100,000 or two...

<p>
Scientology takes all of your money in a clever round-about way: In order to
be &quot;cleared&quot;, you must take a
whole lot of courses of &quot;auditing&quot; to process your &quot;engrams&quot;.
(Translation: Fix your mind by removing the harmful
effects of memories of past injuries.)

They start off by offering you a free &quot;personality test&quot;, but
the results of the test are <i>always</i> that you need to take a Scientology
course, and you should buy a book, too.
<p>
The courses start off being
relatively inexpensive, like $75, but after the first few courses, the prices go up sharply,
and they keep going up. 

The cost of the higher-level courses ranges from $8000 to $77,000, each.
To become a <b><i>&quot;Clear&quot;</i></b> costs $128,560, even with discounts.
For the upper levels you have to pay <i>at least</i> an additional $250,000.

<p>
If you intend to take all of the courses, plan on selling your house and
giving the money to Scientology. Literally. That's what Scientology leaders have
conned gullible members into doing &#8212; mortgage their houses to the hilt and give the
money to Scientology for more &quot;courses&quot; and &quot;auditing&quot;.
And then they want you to max out your credit cards, and borrow all of the money that
you can possibly borrow &#8212; to put your entire life in hock &#8212; and give it all to Scientology.
<p>
Would you like to be a &quot;patron&quot; of Scientology, like some movie stars are?
These are the prices:
<ul>
<li> Patron &#8212; $40,000.
<li> Patron with Honors &#8212; $100,000.
<li> Patron Meritorious &#8212; $250,000.
<li> Gold Patron Meritorious &#8212; $1,000,000.
</ul>

<p>
I knew one woman who was into Scientology, who said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You know, if I only had $50,000, I could
really get my head together.&quot;
</font>
(That was $50,000 in 1980 dollars.)<br>
I had to agree that she needed her head examined, but didn't agree
about the proper course of treatment.

<p>
In one of his bulletins to Scientology officials, the cult leader L. Ron
Hubbard told them to,
<font color="#4f007f"><b>
&quot;Make money. Make more money. Make others produce so as to make money...
However you get them in or why, just do it.&quot;
</b></font>

<p>
And lately, Scientology has been advertising a new racket on
the streets &#8212; the &quot;Purity Rundown&quot;.
They will clear your body of harmful toxins, for
a price. Scientology says that you are being harmed and held back and
kept from your true powers and your grand spiritual destiny
by all kinds of nasty toxins that are lodged in your body
and poisoning you. Not only do you have a problem with all of
the environmental poisons you were ever exposed to, the junk in
the air you breathed and the water you drank, but, Scientology says,
if you ever took any
drugs, even maybe just smoked a little pot in college back in the
sixties, then you still have residual poisons from those things
lurking in your body, doing terrible things to you, and you
need to be detoxified by skilled Scientologists.
<p>
Curiously, the pamphlet that advertises this detoxification
treatment says that Scientology makes no claims that you will
get any medical benefits from it;
it only says that you will get &quot;spiritual&quot;
benefits...

<p>
On the other hand, the U.S. Surgeon General said that the Scientology &quot;Purity Rundown&quot;
does have medical effects, and it is very dangerous to your health. It has even caused a few deaths.

<p>
<a name="Synanon_money"> </a>
<li> Synanon had quite a variety of scams: Soliciting donations from
anyone and everyone for their wonderful work in getting people
off of drugs, <i>demanding</i> large donations from the parents of young
addicts, demanding that any member who had any money pay rent to
Synanon, even while working for Synanon for free,
selling office supplies to sympathetic businesses, and running
a wide variety of ordinary businesses like gas stations or
building contractor services, using the free labor of members.
Like so many other cults, it was a rich multi-million-dollar empire
when the police took the leader Charles Dederich off to jail.

Confession Sessions.</b></font><br>
Members will criticize themselves and confess all of their sins
and faults, sometimes engaging in public self-criticism or
confession sessions. This is used by everybody from Maoist
Chinese Communist groups to ultra-Fundamentalist Christian cults.
Confession is one of Dr. Robert J. Lifton's
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank"><i>Eight Conditions of Thought Reform</i></a>.
<a name="cq_induce_guilt"> </a>
Guilt induction and self-criticism
(confession) sessions were at the heart of the
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#Reds" target="_blank">Chinese Communist brainwashing program</a>
that was used on the American and British prisoners during the Korean War.
<p>
<a name="Appel_2"> </a>
Willa Appel compared the study sessions and confession sessions in Chinese
brainwashing and in Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification church:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In China, the purpose of such [study] sessions was to ensure that everyone
understood the lectures and accepted them unequivocally. Following the
study groups were self-criticism sessions in which each person was prevailed upon
to criticize his or her life using proper Communist behavior as a yardstick.
Past and present faults were dissected by the group, whose members
expressed their own zeal for reform in the intensity with which they tore
down each other's defenses. Once a person demonstrated sufficient humility
and offered a satisfactory confession, the group's attitude would soften
and become more accepting. The very process of confessing, then, provided satisfaction.
It rewarded confessors with a sense of belonging and acceptance that was
particularly valued after having been reviled and rejected. Some people, especially
those who had not previously had a clear commitment or goal, experienced this process
as a rebirth. They were exhilarated by their feelings of &quot;belonging&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot;.
For these people Chinese brainwashing was like a religious conversion.<br>

The similarity between religion conversion and Communist conversion
may be much more than just a coincidence.
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman went to China as a Lutheran missionary in 1915,
1916, and 1918, and pushed his degrading, humiliating, version of conversion
that he called &quot;changing people&quot; (into his true-believer followers).
His methods relied heavily on what Dr. Lifton described: lots of confession sessions
and meetings with group pressure to confess, and confession of personal flaws and
shortcomings and personal worthlessness, and confession of powerlessness over sin,
and &quot;you can't think right because you are a sinner and you have been defeated by sin,&quot;
and all the rest of it.
<p>
Is it just a big coincidence that 30 years later the Chinese Communists were using
Buchman's techniques for &quot;changing&quot; people into obedient Communists?
It is more than just a possibility that some of Frank Buchman's converts quit
his cult and joined the Communist Party, and taught the Communists 
the conversion techniques that they had learned from Buchman.

<p>
(The Communists were there when Buchman was there,
and Buchman was in competition with them for the hearts and minds of the people.
Buchman unhappily noted that the Communists were winning.
And they were winning because the Communists did not
insult the Chinese people by declaring that their culture was stupid or
primitive or &quot;unChristian&quot;. and the Communists did not display arrogant,
condescending, know-it-all attitudes towards &quot;the heathens&quot;,
and the Communists were not out to destroy the local cultures.)

<p>
Then there was the story of a Moral Re-Armament (the renamed Oxford Group)
member who was a soldier in the Korean War, and who was captured and became a POW in North Korea.
When he was subjected to the Chinese Communist brainwashing, he remarked that it was
just like an MRA meeting.

Sometimes members will attack and criticize each other
in <i>reverse-confession</i> &quot;group therapy&quot; sessions or
Synanon games.
A &quot;Synanon game&quot; is something like a group therapy
session, except that everyone gangs up on and attacks one person,
listing every imaginable fault that the person has,
listing everything that that person should be confessing.
Then, after everyone has exhausted all of their complaints
against the victim, they will suddenly switch modes,
&quot;flip the box&quot;, and lavishly praise the person they
just denounced. Then the target will be changed, and everyone
attacks someone else. This continues in a random fashion until
everyone's ego has been shredded (except for the ego of Chuck Dederich,
the cult leader, of course).
This is very similar to a
variation on confession that the Maoist Chinese Communists
sometimes used, where everyone had to criticize someone else
at the meeting.

<a name="Scientology_confession_sessions"> </a>
Scientology cleverly disguises its confession sessions by making
them look like psychotherapy sessions. People who are being
&quot;audited&quot; hold a couple of tin cans which are connected
to a meter that measures skin resistance (Galvanic Skin Response),
like how a lie detector machine does.
Then they answer questions about their past, and eventually
reveal their every secret, and confess everything to their auditor,
who keeps a file on them which can be used to blackmail them later,
and keep them from leaving the cult, and keep them from
publicly criticizing Scientology or telling the truth about the cult.

A System of Punishments and Rewards.</b></font><br>
The cult has some kind of a system for punishing those members
who &quot;stray from the path&quot; or break any of the cult's
many rules and procedures. And there is also some kind of system
of rewards for those who conform and obey and follow all of the
rules.

<p>
The systems of rewards and punishments can start off with
seemingly innocuous things, like the praise of the cult leader.
Those who fail to sell enough flowers or books or bring in their
quota of contributions receive the harsh criticism of the leader,
while those who do bring in the bucks receive the leader's praise.
The same goes for bringing in new recruits.
<p>
Then things get worse, with things like denying people food or sleep,
or baths, making them do punitive work,
or sentencing them to long chanting sessions, or just about
any kind of torture you can think of.

<p>
<a name="Scientology_punishments"> </a>
Jim Jones' People's Temple routinely beat people for even minor
infractions, like getting a parking ticket on a Temple vehicle.
Scientology has &quot;RPF&quot;, the &quot;Rehabilitation
Project Force&quot; which actually runs fortified and armed
prison camps for out-of-favor Scientologists, like the
&quot;Gold Base&quot; &#8212; the Gilman Hot
Springs Scientology base, and
the &quot;Happy Valley&quot; camp near Hemet, California.

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="_blank">Synanon</a> had
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_confessions" target="_blank">The Game</a>&quot;,
which was sort of like an encounter group
crossed with a Red Chinese reverse-confession session &#8212; a session
where everyone criticizes someone else. In <i>The Game</i>, large
numbers of people would gang up on and denounce one person who had failed
to conform to the rules in some way, or whose behavior was less
than sterling.
There were
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Yablonsky_gush" target="_blank">variations on The Game</a>
where the victims were forbidden to defend
themselves. They had to just take all of the abuse and criticism
that others heaped on them.
Then the group could sentence the victim to some kind of punishment,
called <i>&quot;giving them a contract.&quot;</i>

<p>
The &quot;Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints&quot; (FLDS) cult in Utah,
Arizona, and Texas, that is led by Warren Jeffs, has a really draconian
system for rewarding or punishing followers. Warren Jeffs' son,
who has quit the cult and wrote a book about it, explained how Warren Jeffs would
take the wives and children away from dissident members who failed to follow his orders,
and give them to a different follower who was obeying Warrren Jeffs.
The dissident member was then ostracized, and
the former wives and children could not even talk to their former husband and father.
<p>
In the FLDS church, they believe that the number of wives that a man has on Earth
establishes his future status in Heaven. One wife is good, but two is better,
and three is much better, and four wives gets a man the highest rank in Heaven.
Thus, Warren Jeffs taking a man's wives away from him not only wrecks
his life here on Earth; it also ruins his ticket to Heaven.
That makes being stripped of one's wives and children a doubly-horrible punishment.

The most extreme cults often have an armed goon squad

An Impossible Superhuman Model of Perfection.</b></font><br>
In all mind control cults, an <i>ahuman</i> model of perfection
is held out.
<i>Pure</i> and <i>impure</i> are defined by the ideology of the
organization. The demand for <i>purity</i> is intense.
<p>
Dr. Robert J. Lifton calls this item <i>Self-sanctification through
Purity</i>, and it is one of his
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">Eight Conditions of Thought
Reform</a>. (<i>Thought Reform</i> is what Lifton called the Chinese Communist brainwashing.)
&quot;Only by pushing toward perfection, as the group views
goodness, will the recruit be able to contribute.&quot;

<p>
The model of perfection is simply impossible to attain,
because it is too idealized, too lofty, too perfect.
Someone would have to be a living saint or an angel to be that good.
This is, of course, great for making people feel guilty and inadequate,
which is the goal. Then people are punished and learn to punish
themselves for not living up to the group's ideals.

&quot;An answer to what?&quot; I asked.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Well, as to why the delivery went so badly,&quot; she retorted,
looking surprised that I would not know. &quot;I want you to pray about

I was left speechless. The absolutely most beautiful memory that a woman

has flipped and

<p>
All religions have goofy precepts and rituals, but Scientology leads the
pack with L. Ron Hubbard's cracked notion that babies are better off if
they enter a world that is as silent as the womb.

<p>
It might be good for the baby, but it is not going to work for the
mother unless she is drugged into unconsciousness &#8212; one of the many
bits of modern medicine that Scientology disallows.

<p>
During delivery, mother's moanings, father's encouragements and doctor's
orders are discouraged, as is, I suppose, the playing of music, such as
the Rolling Stones' &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; which is the most appropriate
theme music for this relationship that I can imagine.

I don't know about you, but the birth of my first child would have been
cause for my excommunication from Scientology. The spinal block didn't

&#8220;You
only have to see the placenta,&#8221; commented one young mother this week,
&#8220;in order to decide whether or not to eat it.&#8221; But the same logic could
be applied to many other foodstuffs when you see them in the raw, as it
were. The trick, as Tom Cruise will doubtless testify, having this week
reportedly promised to scoff the placenta and umbilical cord of his
newborn baby, is in the preparation. <br><br>

Roasting the placenta with onions, peppers and garlic is one method of
preparation, but others include frying, mincing or turning into p&acirc;t&eacute;.
More modern recipes suggest placenta lasagne, or even power drinks, but
the 21st-century mother is surely most likely to turn hers into a
smoothie with banana, strawberries and yoghurt. <br><br>

Eating placenta is commonplace throughout the animal kingdom, and also
in some non-western societies. In fact, the real controversy over Tom
Cruise&#8217;s suggestion that he would eat his baby&#8217;s placenta &#8211; also known,
less palatably, as the afterbirth &#8211; centres on the question of whether
it was his to eat. <br><br>

There are many who consider the placenta to be the best and most
nutritious thing since sliced bread, and some have criticised Cruise
for denying his partner, Katie Holmes, the life-giving, nutrient-rich
organ. <br>

Swami Prabhupada, the leader of the ISKCON (the &quot;International Society for Krisha Consciousness&quot;)
reinterpreted the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita, this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>11. I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not
contrary to religious principles, O Lord of the Bharatas [Arjuna].</b>
<p>
The strong man's strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression.
Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles (<i>Dharma</i>), should be for the
propagation of children, not otherwise. The responsibility of parents is then to make their
offspring Krsna conscious.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bhagavad-Gita; As It Is</i>, &quot;His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada&quot;, page 252.

</blockquote>
<p>
The first paragraph is from the Bhagavad-Gita; the second paragraph is Swami Prabhupada's interpretation
of it.
Prabhupada says that sex is only for making children; forbidden otherwise.
The Bhagavad-Gita does not say that &#8212; it says only that sex should not be performed against religious
principles, like no adultery or seducing children, or such things. Prabhupada decided all on his
own that sex is only for making children, and that married couples could not enjoy sex just for the
joy of it.
And in his ashrams, married couples had to sleep separated in sex-segregated quarters, just to
make sure.

and the ideology. He should not look at things subjectively, from a self-centered
or selfish point of view, but &quot;objectively,&quot; recognizing that the greatest
good for himself is that which is the greatest good for the group as
a whole. He should be an <i>active</i> enthusiastic supporter of the cause
(apathy and indifference are tantamount to opposition). He should be enthusiastic
about physical labor and manual labor as the essential means to the glorious
&quot;ends&quot; of the revolution rather than being concerned with
intellectual and aesthetic activities, which are often pursued selfishly as
ends in themselves; intellectual and aesthetic activities should be pursued
only for the purpose of effectively communicating the Communist conception of
society and rallying others' support of it. He should be enthusiastic about the
simple, unembellished life rather than being concerned with material possessions
and luxuries of life; he should adopt the simple values and standards of the
working people and peasants, including their language, manners, and morals.
In short, the &quot;new man&quot; should be truly <i>collectivized</i>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The image of the  &quot;new man&quot; was continually held up by the authorities
and by the propaganda organs as the ideal to strive for, and any tendency
of a citizen or a prisoner to behave in a manner not consistent with this
idealized image could and did lead to his being severely criticized.<br>

(The Cambodian Communists, the <i>Khmer Rouge</i>, went far beyond criticism. They murdered
a million people to &quot;purify&quot; Cambodia. See the movie <i>The Killing Fields</i>.)

<p>
Likewise, Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman and his Oxford Group cult insisted
that all good people had to live by the high-falutin'
standards of &quot;The Four Absolutes&quot;: <i>Absolute Purity,
Absolute Honesty, Absolute Love, and Absolute Unselfishness</i>.

Those are impossible standards.
<ul>
<li>
For instance, someone who practices
Absolute Unselfishness should give away his food and money
to a hungry homeless person.
<li>
But he should also practice Absolute Love. He should love the hungry
guy, and he should love himself, too, as another servant of God.
But if he loves himself, and takes care of himself, so that he can be
of greater service to God, he will keep
some food and money for himself, so that he won't starve.
<li>
But that is less than Absolute Unselfishness. Now he's being selfish,
perhaps even a little egotistical, keeping some food and money
for himself, thinking that he is more worthy of the food than
someone else.
<li>
He can't win. He can't live up to both standards at once.
<li>
And if he confesses the
truth, that the standards are impossible, unrealistic, bombastic,
and downright absurd, then he's guilty of violating Cult Rule Number
One &#8212; don't criticize the guru or his teachings &#8212;
<i>The Guru Is Always Right</i>.
<li>
But if he doesn't confess the truth,
then he is being less than Absolutely Honest...
<li>
Obviously, you can drive yourself crazy with that kind of stuff.
Such absolutism is Absolute Nonsense.
</ul>
<p>

We could think of many similar problems with such &quot;Absolutes&quot;,
but one classic example really stands out: The conflict between Absolute
Love and Absolute Honesty. Suppose you are speaking with a really
fat, ugly woman. If you are loving, you will ignore the negative
aspects of her appearance and try to relate to her good qualities.
But if you are absolutely honest, you will tell her how she looks
to you. But that certainly isn't loving.
It's one or the other; you can't do both at the same time.
<p>
That predicament is an example of the more general problem
where someone asks you
to speak ill of another behind his or her back. If you are <i>really
being absolutely honest</i>, you will say that the other person has numerous flaws and
faults. But if you do that, you are being less than a friend to the
criticized person, talking about him behind his back like that (not practicing absolute love
towards that person).
So which do you do, be honest and realistic, or be a loving friend?
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind" target="_blank">Damned if you do, and damned if you don't</a>.
<p>
<font color="blue">
(There is an escape: It is to declare that you have taken a holy vow
never to speak ill of someone behind his back. But that is a sort of
a dodge, isn't it? You are still just avoiding being totally honest.)
</font>

<p><br>
<a name="Scientology_superhuman2"> </a>
Another facet of the demand for Superhuman Perfection is the idea that
we all create our own reality. Scientology and
Werner Erhard's <i>est</i> and its clones like the
&quot;Landmark Forum&quot; or &quot;Landmark Educational Forum&quot;
all push that idea.
<p>
Werner Erhard constantly exhorted people to &quot;Take responsibility
for making their lives work&quot;, and &quot;take responsibility
for ending world hunger&quot;.
<p>
Scientology actually teaches that getting sick and dying is a sign of
laziness and immorality. If you were really a high-energy Operating Thetan,
you would be immortal.
(They still teach that, in spite of the fact that the founder of Scientology,
L. Ron Hubbard, suffered a stroke and died... Go figure.)

Here is another example of Scientology teaching that you must have perfect
mind-over-matter powers: After you take a &quot;personality test&quot;, and rate
yourself on the answers...

You may have realized, while inspecting this chart, that you were not
quite at the top. You need not worry particularly if you discovered
this. Unlike some witch doctors in modern dress, this book is
making no effort to condemn you. There were various reasons why
you permitted yourself to be lowered on this Tone Scale &#8212;
for you had to give your permission to have anything serious
happen to you (a matter which we will cover under SELF-DETERMINISM

</blockquote>
<p>
So Scientology teaches that if you are less than perfect, it is because
you <i>allowed</i> someone to damage you.
<p>
Also notice the invocation of
the standard Scientology bogey-man: psychiatrists,
whom Hubbard called &quot;witch doctors in modern dress&quot;.
L. Ron Hubbard was insane &#8212; a paranoid schizophrenic &#8212;
and he hated and feared the doctors who said that he was insane.

Everybody chooses his life, they say.
People suffer because they have chosen a life of suffering.
The poor are poor by their own stupid, lazy, choice.
Cripples chose to be cripples, and mentally retarded people stupidly
choose to be that way.
Alcoholics and drug addicts all voluntarily choose to be that way.
Obviously, you can discard all compassion for the suffering people
of the world if you believe such things. And you can feel terribly
guilty about all of the things in your own life that are less than
perfect. (And that is a big part of the idea:
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_induce_guilt" target="_blank">to make you feel guilty</a>.)
<p>
But if you think about it for a minute, the idea of everybody
choosing his own reality is absurd. It implies that we are all
gods with superhuman powers, in total control of the world.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Did a little girl whose parents were just killed in a car accident
choose to become an orphan? How?
<p>
<li> Did the wives who became widows in the September 11 World Trade
Center disaster really choose the single life? How?<br>
<font color="blue">
(That opens up very screwy lines of logic like: If the widows really
did choose that reality, then the hijackers who flew the airplanes into
the skyscrapers were really just the mental slaves of the wives,
doing the bidding of the wives, rather than carrying out their crazy
ideas of the Will of Allah, weren't they?
So the September 11 disaster was really the fault
of the wives and orphans who are now collecting on the life insurance
policies...)
</font>
</ul>
<p>
The truth is that neither extreme is true. We do not totally control
our lives, and determine everything that happens, but neither are we
powerless and unable to control our fates at all. The truth is somewhere
in the middle.

Mentoring.</b></font><br>
The group has a system of mentoring, where newcomers are taken under the
wing of an elder, and indoctrinated and trained in the ways of the group.
It is a given that the &quot;old-comers&quot; must supervise the
newcomers, and educate and train them and make them think properly,
and make them follow the rules and conform to the group's standards.
<p>

In a cult, the newcomers are abused by their mentors or the guru, or both,
until they graduate to
the inner circle, at which time they can then abuse others as they
were abused.
Dr. Robert J. Lifton, the author of the classic study of Chinese Communist
brainwashing, <i>Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A
Study of 'Brainwashing' in China</i>, called this &quot;the psychology
of the pawn.&quot;
Abused, tormented personalities get their kicks not by rebelling
against their oppressors, but rather by graduating to become one of
the oppressors, and doing it all to someone else.

<p>
In the classic science fiction novel <i>Stranger In A Strange Land</i>,
Robert Heinlein told the story of Michael, a human child who had been
orphaned on Mars, and raised by Martians. When he was brought back
to Earth, Michael was unable to understand humans or laughter until
he was at a zoo one day, and saw the monkeys fighting.
A medium-sized monkey had a banana, but a bigger monkey came over
and punched him and took the banana. The medium-sized monkey
immediately ran over to a smaller monkey and punched him. Michael
collapsed laughing, because he felt that he had finally come to
understand humans.
<p>
Cult members make that story all too true.

<p> <a name="COG"> </a>
Some cults, like <i>Heaven's Gate</i> and David Berg's
<i>Children of God</i>,
called the mentoring system a &quot;buddy system.&quot;
In both groups, new inductees could not go anywhere without their
buddy, not even to the bathroom. The C.O.G. cult leader's daughter,
Deborah (Linda Berg) Davis, described the system in COG like this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All new members were placed under the strict scrutiny of an older
disciple. This was the &quot;buddy&quot; system. At such a time
that they proved to be strong, mature disciples, they were no
longer considered &quot;babes&quot; and were free to be on their
own. This period usually lasted about three months. One girl told
me in later years, &quot;Oh, I had the worst trial of my life
at TSC [The Soul Clinic]; I was constantly with my 'buddy.' I
couldn't do anything without her. I couldn't even go to the
bathroom alone. Beds were in short supply, and I even had to
sleep in the same bed with her!&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ironically, without any prompting from the Chinese Communists, we
unconsciously incorporated many of the same conditions used by
the Chinese in their Thought Reform programs. Many of these
mind-control techniques seem to erupt &quot;spontaneously&quot;
in cultic organizations. We boasted that we were &quot;heartwashing&quot;
new converts.<br>
<a name="forsake_all"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Everyone who came to TSC as a dropout or hippie or college student
left with a new identity. Everyone took a new name from the
Bible &#8212; this was part of Forsaking All. God was making &quot;new
creatures&quot; out of us; all the old things were done away with.
A new convert broke all relations with the past, both family and
friends. The break with one's former life had to be complete,
absolute, because that's what Jesus wanted.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This sudden loss of identity often brought deep conflicts for
disciples who suffered the after-pains of leaving their former
life-styles and families. This was why everyone had a buddy.
When the older disciple perceived that the younger one was
wavering and suffering doubt, he was right there to pick him up.
Although it was never revealed, the older disciple often
harbored the same doubts. By encouraging the younger convert,
the older member strengthened himself. It was a good system
that accomplished its purpose well.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Children of God: The Inside Story</i>,
Deborah (Linda Berg) Davis, 1984, pages 81-82.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
Ms. Davis said that the Children of God were allowed to separate
from their buddy after about three months. In the <i>Heaven's Gate</i>
cult, they were never allowed loose. They stayed paired right up
to the time when they committed suicide together.
<p>

Note that Deborah Davis touched on a couple of other indoctrination
and conversion
techniques besides just mentoring:
milieu control and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#selfsell" target="_blank">self-sell</a>.
Milieu control means that the environment and information intake
of the convert are controlled. When the new convert is cut off from family
and former friends, he cannot receive any
negative information about the cult that might lead him away
from the cult, and he can't even get any 'common-sense' messages
that might &quot;bring him back to Earth&quot; and
interfere with his indoctrination.
At the same time, the older buddy is busy selling himself on the cult
and assuaging his own doubts by selling the cult to the younger buddy.
That's self-sell.
<p>
Deborah Davis also described several other standard cult characteristics:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_indoctrination" target="_blank">15. Indoctrination of members.</a>

Intrusiveness.</b></font><br>
The cult is very intrusive, and pokes into members' personal lives.
Often, the guru and his helpers want to totally run the member's
lives, dictating everything from what work the followers will do,
where they will live, what they will eat, when they will sleep,
with whom they may communicate or associate, to what they will wear.
Sometimes, members need permission to visit their families.
Sometimes, the cult even goes so far as to dictate when and with
whom members may have sex or marry. Many cults also feel entitled
to take people's children away from them and put the kids into
special &quot;schools&quot;
where they are beaten and abused, and brainwashed into being the
next generation of true believers.

<p>
In many cults, especially recovery cults, the elders will proclaim
that you simply cannot have any kind of privacy or private life &#8212;
that you will just commit sins, or drink, or take drugs if you have
the freedom to do so &#8212; so they won't let you have any freedom or privacy.
Such cults want to own you; they want all of your time;
they want to dominate your whole life. No part of your life is not
subject to their inspection and their &quot;guidance&quot;.

Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot; cult was so intrusive that Buchman declared that
even sex between married couples was an unspiritual &quot;indulgence&quot; that would harm
the children:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Indulgence by the married, while having the cloak of legitimacy, may
nevertheless be the source of irritable tempers and of inability to answer
to the real needs of the children. Parents indulgent inside marriage
need not be surprised if their children are indulgent outside marriage.
A union which could otherwise be powerful for remaking the nation
thus remains a soft and uninspiring association.<br>

children might enjoy sex outside of marriage. Says who? Where did that come from?

auctioned off each evening for a one-night stand.

Werner Erhard's <i>est</i> was just the same:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Throughout est's existence, Erhard had treated sex as simply
another form of human behavior to be controlled and manipulated
in ways that enhanced his own overpowering control over the
lives of others who inhabited the est culture. Long before he ever
started est, Werner Erhard &#8212; even when he was still Jack
Rosenberg &#8212; used his powerful sexual appeal and charismatic
energy with women to intensify their own sense of loyalty and
devotion to him. During his bookselling days, Erhard maintained
the nucleus of a dedicated, and predominately female, staff
partly by showering his romantic attention from time to time
on some of the women who followed Erhard first into Mind Dynamics
and later into est.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Inside the emerging est culture, Erhard continued to view sex
as an integral part of his obsessive demand that others around
him pledge their devotion. He required staff members to divulge
the most intimate details of their personal lives as part
of a series of policies aimed at controlling their thoughts and
behavior. A staff policy imposed in the mid-1970s instructed est
staffers to &quot;stay in communication&quot; with Erhard about
their personal relationships, particularly those of a sexual
nature.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Although the policy was designed to proscribe sexual relations
between staff members, exceptions were possible in cases in
which Erhard was informed about existing affairs. These
relationships could continue to include &quot;fucking,&quot;
the staff was told, but only as long as the trysting staffers
got their jobs done and showed no signs of &quot;upsets.&quot;
The policy made it clear to the staff that Erhard would
attribute declining job performance to the fact that &quot;you
are fucking whomever you fuck&quot; and would ask the offending
party to leave est.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Erhard generously added a &quot;family policy&quot; to the est
rules governing sexual conduct, mindful of the occasional desire
among married staff members to enjoy dalliances with other partners
besides their spouse. The policy, which otherwise prohibited
extramarital affairs, allowed such liaisons as long as Don Cox
received a letter from an est staffer's wife or husband allowing
their spouse &quot;to fuck someone else.&quot; The letter also
had to include &quot;guidelines&quot; aimed at identifying
those with whom the spouse could enjoy sexual intimacy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the early years of est, Erhard had a habit of announcing
strict rules proscribing sexual liaisons among staff members,
only to drop them at particularly opportune times and reinstate
them at a later date. While treating the staff to a weeklong
Mexican cruise in 1974, Erhard abruptly lifted the sexual ban,
delighting many along for the trip. After an amorous week at
sea, Erhard reimposed the no-sex rules back in San Francisco.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No such self-reporting sexual rules applied to Erhard. Instead,
he entrusted to his closest aides the confidential role of
assisting in the steady, though usually clandestine, flow of
women in and out of his private black-painted bedroom on the
second floor of the Franklin House. Sometimes his partners came
from the ranks of celebrity est enthusiasts, including actress
Cloris Leachman, with whom Erhard maintained a relationship
for a few years. Otherwise, Erhard helped himself to the sexual
favors offered to him by an assortment of attractive staff members
and est volunteers. A comely Franklin House assistant once
confided to an est trainer that another Erhard aide &quot;schedules
Werner's cock&quot; and that she planned &quot;to get on the
schedule.&quot;<br>

Synanon, The People's Temple, and the Hari Krishnas (ISKCON)
all took members' children away from them, and brutally beat and abused
those children.
Many people found that they couldn't even get their kids back
when they tried to leave the People's Temple. Timothy Stoen, who
had been a lawyer for the Temple before he quit the cult,
never did succeed in getting his own son away from Jim Jones, who
argued in court that the kid was his, and refused to give the
kid up.
Timothy Stoen's son and 275 other children were murdered during
the Jonestown massacre/mass suicide, given cyanide Kool-Aid to

<a name="Koresh"> </a>
And at the <i>Branch Davidian</i> compound of Vernon Howell, also
known as &quot;David Koresh&quot;, in Waco, Texas,

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
According to Koresh, sexual life was fine in past ages; indeed, it
was necessary for the propagation of the species. However, just before the
end of time, those who have purified themselves for the new creation and for
the Kingdom of God must separate themselves from this passing, obsolete state
of life. Celibacy was hard for the other Davidians to accept, to put it mildly.<br>
 ... <br>
Once in a Bible study session Koresh had one of the women stand and lift up
her dress, exposing her legs and underpants. He told everyone to look at her
for a moment, then asked how many of the men had been aroused or distracted
although they had no legitimate reason to have sexual thoughts toward this
particular woman. Such a demonstration attempted to illustrate how human
sexuality is an untamed force that actually leads to deceit and disruption
in human relationships. Koresh stressed the ideal potential of the liberated
person, free from lust, which even when legalized by marriage is a distraction
from higher and ultimate purposes. He emphasized that the group, as part
of the vanguard of the age to come, needed purity. Most went along with
this teaching, and the men and women of the group began to live separately.<br>

However, a little later, &quot;David Koresh&quot; promulgated his

only he had the right to procreate, because he was the Son of God,
and he was entitled, even biologically and spiritually obligated,
to have all of the women and post-pubescent girls sexually, to create
the new Grandchildren of God. (What's really amazing is that most
of the other guys in the cult went along with it and handed over
their wives and daughters. Only a couple of guys quit the cult over
that.)<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>
