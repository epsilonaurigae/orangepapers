Bill Wilson also shamelessly lied when he wrote that, because
there were only about 40 sober members of Alcoholics Anonymous
altogether in the whole world,
 including all of the members of the groups in New York, Akron,
and Cleveland, when Bill started writing the <i>Big Book</i> in late
1938.
Nevertheless, Bill Wilson grandly called them 
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank">The First 100</a>&quot;.

And there were only 70 sober members of A.A. worldwide when
Bill Wilson finished writing his chapters in early 1939,
and most of them eventually relapsed and returned to a life of drinking.
They had not &quot;recovered&quot;.
They had not &quot;solved the drink problem.&quot;

<p>
Bill Wilson kept the first copy of the <i>Big Book</i> that came off of
the presses, and it in, he kept track of the authors of the
autobiographical stories, and noted who relapsed and who didn't.
Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary, saw the book, and
reported that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses" target="_blank">
fully 50% of the original <i>Big Book</i> authors relapsed and went back to drinking.</a>

<p><br><li> A.A. and the Twelve Steps are
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">the only way</a> to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">survive alcoholism</a>.
Nobody can successfully quit an alcohol or
drug habit without a &quot;support group&quot; and attending hundreds
of meetings for many years, preferably for the rest of his or her life.  
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment" target="_blank">Nobody can do it alone.</a>
<p>
And anyone who successfully quits drinking alcohol on his own,
without going to A.A. meetings and doing the Twelve Steps,
will suffer from a mysterious disease which will turn him into
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#abstaining" target="_blank">a &quot;dry drunk.&quot;</a>
<p>
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">You are such a stupid loser</a>
that there is no way that you can quit drinking by yourself, or keep yourself sober.
But a bunch of other similar stupid losers who are also incapable of
quitting drinking or keeping themselves sober will keep you sober.
<p>
The answer to all crises in life is, &quot;Get to a meeting, quick!&quot;
<p>
And everyone who is recovering from an alcohol or drug problem is
of course doing it with the Twelve Steps, in Alcoholics Anonymous
or Narcotics Anonymous, because there is no other possible way.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous is not a cult</a>.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous isn't religious, it's spiritual.</a>
<p>
It isn't a religion. You don't have to believe in God.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#bedpan" target="_blank">You can believe anything you want to believe</a>,
and you will still get
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="_blank">miracles on demand</a>.
<p>
A.A. is not an irrational
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">cult religion</a>,
it's only &quot;a spiritual fellowship&quot;.
<p>
Ignore the fact that, after indoctrinating many beginners, A.A. founder Bill Wilson wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;From great numbers of such experiences, we could predict
that the doubter ... would presently love God and call Him by
name.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,

</blockquote>
<p>
Also, just ignore Bill Wilson's declaration that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.

<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
Never mind all of
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">the state Supreme Court Justices
and Federal District Court Judges</a> who have ruled that Alcoholics
Anonymous is a religion, or engages in religious activities.
We'll just ignore them too.
<p>
Also ignore Bill Wilson's speech to the American Psychiatric Association:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of course we speak little of conversion

you want, or none at all, in A.A.  You can have
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">any Higher Power or God you want</a>,
including a Golden Calf or a bedpan or a motorcycle, and praying to such a Higher Power will
restore you to sanity and take away your desire to drink. That isn't
irrational or crazy;

 Alcoholics Anonymous is completely compatible with Christianity; it's just

<p><br><li> You must be
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">an agnostic
or an atheist</a> if you object to faith healing,
superstitious nonsense, and voodoo medicine as your
alcoholism recovery program.

<p><br><li> It's okay to

<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">deceive them</a> about the true
nature of A.A., if it will keep them coming back.
Also, we shouldn't openly tell the whole truth about the religious nature of A.A.;
it might confuse the newcomers.

Bill Wilson described the writing of the <i>Big Book</i>, hiding the religious
nature of Alcoholics Anonymous, in order to deceive the newcomers, this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Fitz wanted a powerfully religious document; Henry and Jimmy would have none of it.
They wanted a psychological book which would
<font color="blue">lure the reader in</font>; when
he finally arrived among us, there would then be enough time to tip him
off about the spiritual character of our society. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; As umpire of these
disputes, I was obliged to go pretty much down the middle, writing in
spiritual rather than religious or entirely psychological terms.<br>

<p><br><li> If you're not ready to quit drinking completely,
there's nothing you can do about a drinking problem.
<a href="orange-letters59.html#moderate" target="_blank">Nobody can just cut back and drink in moderation</a>.

<p><br><li> Nobody can quit drinking until they
<a href="orange-not_good.html#hit_bottom" target="_blank">hit bottom and are ready
to surrender</a> to the A.A. program. People who refuse to surrender to their
sponsor and the group and do what they are told
should go back out and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#our_brothers" target="_blank">do some more research on the subject</a>.

<p><br><li> Surrendering and being a slave of A.A. makes you free.
<a href="orange-not_good.html#Orwellian" target="_blank">Dependency on A.A. makes
you independent.</a>
Dependency on A.A. is wonderful and produces
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#baleful" target="_blank">no baleful results</a>.
Confessing powerlessness makes you powerful.
Apologizing for your behavior your whole life, and confessing
everything and feeling guilty and humble about everything
will give you self-respect.

<p><br><li> You need this.
You need us to shove our religion (that we won't call a religion)
and its strange beliefs and practices on you, because
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_cant_without" target="_blank">you will die if we don't</a>.
Right now,
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">your thinking is so messed up</a>
that you think you don't need this program, but you will thank us later.

<p><br><li> In A.A.,
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_mentoring" target="_blank">nobody has any power over anyone else</a>.
In A.A., everybody is equal (but some people are more equal than others).
<p>
Also, the A.A. leaders are but trusted servants. They do not rule, and would never engage in
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">lawsuits to punish A.A. members</a>
who do legal things that the leaders don't like.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad9" target="_blank">A.A. is not organized</a>.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">A.A. is a program of attraction, not promotion</a>.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-letters316.html#about_God" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps are all about quitting drinking</a>.
<ul>
<li> Never mind the fact that the Twelve Steps never tell you to quit
drinking, or to help anyone else to quit drinking either.
<li> Never mind the fact that the Twelve Steps don't contain any of
these words or phrases:
<ul>
<li> &quot;quit drinking,&quot;
<li> &quot;abstain from drinking,&quot;
<li> &quot;drink less,&quot;
<li> &quot;recovery,&quot;
<li> &quot;abstinence,&quot;
<li> &quot;sobriety,&quot;
<li> &quot;health,&quot;
<li> &quot;happiness,&quot;
<li> &quot;prosperity,&quot;
<li> &quot;compassion&quot;,
<li> or &quot;love.&quot;
</ul>
<li> Never mind the fact that 6 of the 12 steps refer to God, and surrendering to God,
confessing to God, begging God for miracles, praying to God,
and seeking and doing God's will, and getting power from God.
The Twelve Steps are still all about quitting drinking, not religion.

<li> For that matter, also never mind the fact that 7 of the 12 steps &#8212;
Steps Four through Ten &#8212; are designed to make you feel guilty:
They are all about you listing and confessing all of your sins,
character defects, moral shortcomings, <i>the exact nature of your
wrongs</i>, and everyone you ever harmed or offended.
The Twelve Steps are <i>still</i> all about quitting drinking, they say;
the Steps are not the mind-bending
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_induce_guilt" target="_blank">guilt-induction routines</a> of a
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">cult religion</a>.

<li> And never mind the fact that Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps, and
Frank Buchman's procedures from which Bill derived those steps,
strongly resemble the
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds" target="_blank">Red Chinese program
of brainwashing</a>,
with all of its guilt-inducing &quot;self-criticism&quot; sessions.

</ul>


<p><br><li> You really are stupid and evil.
You are far too stupid to be able to quit drinking by yourself.
Your thinking is all messed up, and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">you can't trust your own mind</a>.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#alcoholic_defects" target="_blank">Your character is full of defects</a>.
Your thinking is alcoholic.
You are selfish and self-centered and manipulative and unspiritual and you just
want to be happy and feel good. Your true innermost nature is that
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">you are inherently sinful and disgusting</a>.

<p><br><li> Treating people badly is how you make them be good.<br>
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">Tough love programs</a> really work
to save the lives of alcoholics and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="_blank">drug addicts</a>.

<p><br><li> Everything good that A.A. members do is Alcoholics Anonymous,
but the bad things that A.A. members do is not really A.A...
If a sponsor does some despicable thing that is not council-approved
to a sponsee, then that doesn't count.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#jealous" target="_blank">The wives of the alcoholics wrote the <i>Big Book</i>
chapter <i>&quot;To Wives&quot;</i></a>.
<p>
When Bill Wilson wrote on the first page of the <i>To Wives</i> chapter:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As wives of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to
feel that we understand as perhaps few can.
We want to analyze mistakes we have made.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
chapter 8, <i>To Wives</i>, page 104.</font>
</blockquote>
&#8212; that wasn't deceiving the readers. And when Bill began the next chapter
with the words:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our women folk have suggested certain attitudes a wife may take with the
husband who is recovering. Perhaps they created the impression that he
is to be wrapped in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, <i>The Family Afterward</i>, page 122.</font>
</blockquote>
&#8212; that wasn't a lie either.

<p>
And when page 51 of <i>Big Book Unplugged; A Young Person's Guide to Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
a condensation of the <i>Big Book</i> that targets teenagers, tells us that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Chapter 8 is written by wives, but you don't need to be a wife to benefit from
the authors' advice.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hey!
<a href="orange-heresy.html#BB_Unplugged2" target="_blank">That's the gospel truth, too</a>.
You can bet your children's lives on it.

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-letters179.html#broker" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was a stock broker</a>.
 He said so in the beginning of the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The spark that was to flare into the first A.A. group was struck at Akron, Ohio, in June 1935,
during a talk between a New York stockbroker and an Akron physician.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p><br><li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">
Bill Wilson never cheated on his wife</a>. He said so in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There were many unhappy scenes in our sumptuous apartment. There had been no
real infidelity, for loyalty to my wife, helped at times by extreme
drunkenness, kept me out of those scrapes.<br>

<p>


<p><br><li> Alcoholics Anonymous was
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">fantastically successful
in the beginning</a>. They had a great success rate in sobering up
alcoholics.
A.A. has only gone a bit downhill just recently.


<p><br><li>
No reasonable person would criticize A.A., because A.A.
is a wonderful organization that has saved millions.
<ul>
<li>
Anyone who criticizes Alcoholics Anonymous is just
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">a dry drunk</a></i>.
<li>
Or he's just somebody
<a href="orange-letters18.html#hominem1" target="_blank">who doesn't want to quit drinking</a>.
<li>
Or he's just somebody who
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#too_good" target="_blank">doesn't want to get too good too soon</a>.
<li>
Or he's just
<a href="orange-letters12.html#G_word" target="_blank">an atheist who can't stand to
hear the terrible 'G' word &quot;God&quot; mentioned</a>.
<li>
Or he's just somebody who is
<a href="orange-letters24.html#boxing">boxing with God</a>.
<li>
Or he is somebody who is afraid to get sober.
<li>
Or
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment99" target="_blank">he has a resentment</a>.
</ul>

<p><br><li>
&quot;Nobody is ever too dumb to get the program, but some people are too intelligent.&quot;<br>
&quot;<a href="orange-letters155.html#intelligent" target="_blank">Some people just don't get
the A.A. program. They are just far too intelligent to be helped.</a>&quot;

</ol>

<p><br><br>
What? That isn't twelve? Oh well, close enough. It's still more
accurate than saying,
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">It isn't religious, it's
spiritual</a>.&quot;
