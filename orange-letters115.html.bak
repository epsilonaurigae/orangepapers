It was Kyle's suicide that finally got me to sit down, latte in hand, to
write about my thoughts regarding a 12 Step based recovery program that I
have once again distanced myself from.  Kyle was the group's &quot;Guru&quot;.  For
those of you not familiar with 12 step programs, the group Guru is the
person who claims a significant amount of sobriety, sponsors a number of
people (i.e. serves as their guide as they seek sobriety), and has a good
grasp on the tenants of the program itself (notably, the 12 steps, 12
traditions, as well as sundry explicit and implicit rules followed by those
hoping to conform to the group?s norms).

<P>
The particular group that I am distancing myself from has to do with
recovery from sex and love addiction.  It is based on the model of
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  Similar to AA, this program professes to help
those suffering from sex and love addictions to overcome their problems
through the application of the 12 steps of recovery.  Unlike AA, which sees
total abstinence from alcohol as the primary means of sobriety, this sex
fellowship allows its members to define their own &quot;bottom line&quot; for what
they consider to be the boundary between sober and non-sober behavior.  One
member might define sobriety as abstinence from masturbation and
pornography, while another may see romance outside the marriage as a breach
of their personal sobriety.

<P>
I hope to be able to express what I feel about the program and my
perspectives on how it might just not be helpful to people with sex
problems.  Kyle was found by police this past February dead in his car.  He
had rented a pair of helium canisters from a local party store and
suffocated himself by releasing the gas with the car windows closed.  His
wife had earlier issued a missing persons report, suspecting that he had
something like this in mind.  I found out about the death from a friend in
the program a day or two after the police had found his body.

<P>
Up until a few years earlier, Kyle's life had seemed to be going well for
him.  He was a popular addiction counselor at a local substance abuse
hospital and had recently obtained his masters in counseling from a local
state college.  As mentioned earlier, Kyle was also the group's guru.  He
sponsored people, some of whom had accumulated over a year of sobriety.  His
word was respected in the meeting room because he himself had over 10 years
of sobriety.  He was definitely the exception to the norm, as you'll see
later.

<P>
I never really got along with Kyle. Truth be told, we did not hit it off
very well with another.  I entered the program in July, 2004 finally
determined to tackle those pesky homo-erotic urges that I had been
struggling with since early childhood.  Perhaps struggling is somewhat of a
harsh word.  I actually felt very comfortable with my attraction to both
older men and women's lingerie before I hit the teenage years. But then I
learned that &quot;faggots&quot; were abnormal, pussies, degenerates.  This lead to
much internal turmoil and shame about my worth as a person.

<P>
I had already been a member, albeit an increasingly part time one, of AA for
14 years when I entered the sex and love fellowship in 2004.  My drinking
had started in my teenage years, primarily, I believe, as a result of the
shame I had with my sexual orientation.  I had had a few same-sex
experiences prior to entering an AA.  What finally got me into that program
was a clumsy pass I had made to a male friend when drunk.  After that fiasco
I feared that alcohol might lead me there once again.  I was (and still am)
married at the time, so having a wife and child to support added to the
shame of wanting to have sex with men.

<P>
Anyway, in 2004 I was approaching 40 and had recently begun cross-dressing
in private again.   It was nothing too fancy.  I'd wait until my wife and
kids were gone, then I'd slip on her pantyhose and heels and masturbate.  I
had done a lot of that in my teens and twenties, but had largely stopped
when I hit my 30's.  Well, that summer my wife took all the kids to visit
her mother and I finally had the house to myself.  I over-indulged, so to
speak.  The dress ups began in earnest, I masturbated to the point of
actually feeling pain, and I tried to hook up with an old lover who I had
never found particularly attractive.  I did not know about Craigslist at
that time.

<P>
Long story short, I exhausted myself over the course of three weeks with all
the masturbation and fantasizing, never hooked up with old lover, and ended
up a nervous, spent wreck.  I found the sex fellowship on the Web and
thought that I just might be able to lick this problem with another 12 step
program.  After all, it had worked so marvelously with AA, hadn't it?  I
attended my first meeting right after my fortieth birthday.  My wife had not
yet returned home with the kids, so I had the freedom to travel a little out
of my way to make the meeting.

<P>
Back to Kyle.  You might remember that 2004 was a bit of a tumultuous period
in the USA.  George Bush was up for a second term and John Kerry had
recently been chosen as his democratic rival.  My first surprise came after
a meeting or two, when one of Kyle's sponsees (I'll call him Carl) came up
to me before a meeting and handed me political tracts clearly favoring one
end of the political spectrum.  I thanked him and asked why he thought I
should have these.  He told me that he could see from a mile away that I was
affiliated with such-and-such a party.  Truth be told, he was correct.  I
took all of it with a good sense of humor, figuring that Carl was teasing me
a bit.  I got a little more worried however when Carl offered up these
pamphlets to other members before the meeting started.  I got even more
worried when Kyle showed up at the meeting one day wearing a large square
political button on his hat. I clearly remember him sitting down across from
me and smirking in my direction.  I hate to be smirked at.  I also recalled
that political or religious proselytizing is frowned upon in 12 step
programs.  This didn't seem to apply to the guru or his acolyte.

<P>
So, in my warped sense of what might be good for me, what did I do'  I asked
Carl to be my sponsor.  I figured that anyone who does not like me
personally would be a great sponsor because they will be hard on me.  That
makes sense, doesn't it?  Hadn't I heard all the stories of recovery in AA
where the sponsor recommended to their pigeon (a term for he/she who is
sponsored) to &quot;take the cotton out of their ears and put it in their mouth&quot;?
In other words, shut up and listen.  Tough love is what all of us alkies and
addicts need, because although we have a disease that was not our fault we
also happen to have extremely large egos that only a stern sponsor can
break.  Makes sense, doesn't it?  Kind of like getting scared straight in a
spiritual sort of way.

<P>
All this seems a bit strange in retrospect, seeing as how almost every
licensed medical practitioner I have ever encountered has had both a good
dose of compassion and the training to go with it.  Anyway, Kyle was already
a rehab counselor and Carl had seemingly prospered as his pigeon, so maybe I
would in turn prosper with Carl.  This all sounds logical, doesn't it?  I
thought so.  There was absolutely no way that I was ever, ever going to put
on pantyhose, thigh-highs, heels or bras anymore.  No way.  And, the
terrifying prospect of finding Robert Plant (the 60's version), Jude Law,
Tom Selleck (the 80's version), or any of the Marlboro men attractive had to
be nipped in the bud.  This was a disease, gosh darn it, and I was going to
stop it dead in its tracks.

<P>
So there I was. I had my new sponsor, my new fellowship, and my new way of
life.  I told my wife that I had found some special AA meetings closer to
work and that I would have to be home later than usual a few times a week.  She
did not particularly like it but didn't say much.  Carl had limited
sponsoring experience up to that point, but he was (and is) a bright guy.  He
had a lot of interesting insights into life, was not a religious freak, and
did take a lot of his free time before meetings to help me out.  I willingly
let him guide me through the steps, which in this program are written a
little more fancily than in AA.  In fact, the guy who started the sex
fellowship is quite a fancy one himself from what I have heard.  Unlike Bill
W., the found of AA, this fellow, who is still alive, does not have anything
approaching a reputation of continuous sobriety.  In fact another fellow in
the program related to me more than once that founder had once &quot;screwed his
sponsor over&quot;. &quot;Did it concern money?&quot; I innocently asked.  &quot;Uh, no, a
little more than that&quot;, was the response.
I'll leave it at that.

<P>
I really wanted to get better, so in spite of my early warning signs about
Kyle and Carl and the bad reputation of the program's founder I was resolved
give it a shot.   I immediately established what is considered the
traditional bottom line for the program.  There would be no more
masturbating or porn, certainly no more furtive dress ups, and a &quot;three
second&quot; rule would apply to all objects that I found titillating. As you
might guess, following the three second rule means never staring more than
three seconds at an object of desire.  And staring &quot;two-and-a-half&quot; on,
&quot;two-and-a-half&quot; off is also forbidden.  This stuff is taken pretty
seriously in the fellowship.

<P>
I relapsed in short order.  I think the setup for the relapse happened while
my wife and I were having sex and her hair got pushed over to the side,
making her look more masculine.  I started thinking about an old male lover,
and that triggered some masturbation shortly thereafter.  I dutifully
informed Carl and he told me I was exactly where I was supposed to be.  That
sounded good to me, so I redoubled my efforts to stay sober.  I established
my own meeting, thinking that taking a leadership role would help me
maintain sobriety.  It actually seemed to be working for a while, until I
began fantasizing about the cute priest who had let us use the hall.  Further
relapses followed.

<P>
All this time Carl and I were working the steps, sure that these would
provide a more stable foundation for the increasingly elusive sobriety I was
so much in need of.  Now, I could go on about the steps and what they mean
to me today.  I actually liked them when I was attending AA regularly.  For
the uninitiated among you, the 12 steps spell out a series of, well, steps
that one takes in order to overcome addiction and live a happy life.  Google
if you need more information.  The steps are loosely based on the tenants of
an earlier Christian fellowship that the founder of AA belonged to before he
started his own program.  In a nutshell, the steps deal with admitting
defeat, righting past wrongs, and finding God.  And then passing this
knowledge on to others.

<P>
The steps of the sex fellowship, while based on those of AA, were presented
in a way that made me uncomfortable from the get-go.  The AA steps are
basically what-you-see-is-what-you-get.  They were written in a language
similar to that in the Christian New Testament, simple enough for a person
with poor reading skills to understand, yet profound enough to keep
philosophers busy for years.  I don't quite see them that way anymore, but
the analogy still rings true for the most part.  The steps as put forth by
the founder of the sex fellowship seemed on the other hand to be written
more to impress than to instruct.  It's as if he wanted to create something
intensely sublime, yet did not really believe what he was saying.  Although
I have a few college degrees and consider myself fairly intelligent, I found
the readings difficult to decipher at times; they were just too clever by
half for my tastes.  Something was amiss with these steps and it nagged at
me.  They seemed to downplay the straight-forward moral and religious (yes,
AA is religious, I'm sorry) aspects of the original steps in favor of a more
mystical variety, the like of which one is likely to hear being bantered
about at a cocktail party after all other topics have been exhausted.

<P>
Anyway, back to me, my sponsor Carl, and the steps.  Carl was not a
religious fellow by any means.  He professed belief in a higher power, but
beyond that his was a religious-free zone.  This was somewhat refreshing to
me, as many steppers also tend to have a healthy dose of religious fervor
lurking in the wings.  I myself had done the born-again stuff six years
earlier and found it was not for me.  The year 2004 also happened to be a
period in which my church (guess which one) was being bombarded with sexual
abuse allegations world-wide.  I was having my doubts about organized
religion and that made the mystical step path more appealing to me. So off I
went, sex step book in hand, Carl as my sponsor, and a mustard seed of faith
that I would overcome my disease.

<P>
At this juncture I should mention that one of the foundational beliefs of my
recovery at the time was that I wasn't queer.  Carl never steered me towards
thinking this way.  In fact, he was very liberal about the gender issue, as
was the program.  He did think, as did I, that the cross-dressing aspect
harked back to childhood trauma and was causing me to relive painful
episodes all over again.  There may be some truth to this, who knows.  In
fact, Patrick Carnes, the &uuml;ber-guru of the sex-as-an-addiction movement has
published a number of books which link traumatic childhoods to sexually
deviant behavior later in life.  I can't argue either way because I just
don't know.

<P>
Well, the steps experience did not go all that well.  I used the fourth step
(&quot;made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves&quot;) as an
opportunity to write my autobiography.  Kyle had mentioned a number of times
that he had used this to great affect.  I found it made me relapse
more.  Basically,
I forced myself to remember all the bad things that had happened to me and
the stupid or rotten things I had done to others.  It was all very
depressing to say the least. I found solace in masturbation.  In spite of
these set-backs, Carl told me once again that I was just where I was
supposed to be.  Apparently, that is what Kyle had always told him when he
slipped.  I suppose I was lucky to have Carl, and not Kyle, as a sponsor.  Carl
recounted to me one day that Kyle had once imposed a moratorium on him
concerning all sex (normal or not) for 30 days because he had been slipping
too often.  Carl was either too compassionate or too pragmatic to impose
such draconian measures on me.

<P>
So it was almost two years into the program and I had become what they call
in AA a &quot;chronic relapser&quot;.  I just could not put together any significant
sober time.  I was not alone.  In fact, during these two years I did not see
any newcomers get any significant amount of sobriety under their belt.  Truth
be told, I did not see any newcomers stick around very long at all.  Most
came to one meeting, said they would be back, and never returned.  Or came
for a few weeks then stopped.  I'm talking easily 90-95% of all newcomers, I
kid you not.  For those who remained, the vast majority began to slip after
the first couple of months, if not sooner.  The core of the group was (as it
is today, almost five years later) composed of maybe a half dozen people
claiming over a year or more of sobriety.  I know of only one additional
person who has attained a year sobriety in that time period.  These are not
encouraging statistics.

<P>
A couple of other things began to bug me at this point.  First, more than a
few people coming in were in trouble with the law, and seemed to be using
the disease concept of the program as a means to perhaps sway their upcoming
judgment.  I would wager that most were insincere in their stated desire to
get sober.  In fact it was unusual to find any long-term, sober members
(except Kyle) who had committed a sex crime, done their time, and remained
in the program to reap the spiritual benefits promised by the 12
steps.  Something
in the last sentence might have caught your attention. Yes, Kyle was a sex
offender, a convicted felon, a child molester in fact.  How then could he
have been working as an addiction counselor at a major rehab?  Doesn't such
a job provide potential access to minors, vulnerable ones at that?

<P>
The answer to this came when Kyle was arrested for forgetting to do his
yearly registration with the local police department.  This is apparently a
requirement for sex offenders who have been classified at a certain
level.  Anyway,
Kyle was late registering, got arrested, and was promptly fired from the
hospital.  He also lost his license to practice privately.  Now this
bothered a lot of us in the group, including me.  Part of me had sympathy
for Kyle. After all, he was not classified at the most dangerous sex
offender level, and seemed to have done his time and sought a better life.  On
the other hand, he lied to his employer about his past.  What bothered me
even more though was that my sponsor Carl had tried to get me at one time to
use Kyle as a therapist.  Aside from my personal dislike of Kyle, I just had
a feeling that this type of arrangement was not, shall we say, in my best
interests.  I found out later that Karl already had another member of the
group as a client.  It seemed unethical to me that someone was using a
supposedly non-affiliated fellowship to get clients.

<P>
At this juncture I thought it best to take a break from sex recovery.  I
thanked my sponsor for his help and stopped going to meetings. I still
stayed in touch with another member who I had befriended, occasionally going
to a movie with him or getting together to shoot pool. Other than that, my
sex recovery was on hold.

<P>
It was then that I discovered Craigslist.  Ironically, I work with
computers, but never had a clue that there was a free on-line cruising site.
Before you know it, I had hooked up with a few men.  My first encounter
occurred the day before Easter, 2006.  As they say in AA, my higher power
really must have a sense of humor.  I felt a little guilty, but at the same
time very relieved that I was finally being myself.  What struck me most is
that I used a good degree of common sense in terms of the men I hooked up
with.  I conversed with them for a while, got addresses and phone numbers
and made sure that I always practiced safe sex.  This was strange because I
was always led to believe from 12 step programs that I would end up on a
slippery slope, hitting ever new lows before finally reaching rock
bottom.  According
to this logic I should have eventually been doing bareback in some park
bushes in the middle of nowhere.

<P>
But I wasn't. In fact, I eventually found a nice, intelligent and
professional fellow like myself.  We have been lovers on and off for the
past two years or so. I like him a lot, not only for the sex, but also for
the nice conversations both before and after. He also has a decent shower he
lets me use.  I have been with maybe six other guys in that time frame, but
none were really that good looking or pleasant to be with.  My lover is not
the Marlboro man, but he is pretty good looking and has nice manners.

<P>
A few months back, prior to Kyle's suicide, I decided to return to the sex
program.  I had begun getting occasional prolonged heart palpitations, and I
associated these with the heightened sexual encounters I had recently had
with my friend and another man.  Let me tell you, in this respect the
recovery programs are a little bit like the God of the Old Testament.  They
promise you a great future if you stick with them, but have a lot of dire
warnings for those who do not toe the party line.  I have a both a
superstitious and cowardly streak in me.  In my opinion, these are the
personality traits which 12 step programs thrive on.  The heart flutters
convinced me I had to appease the gods once again, lest endure an agonizing
and early death.

<P>
So in September of 2008 I came back into the halls, explained that I was
having heart problems because of my acting out, and vowed to get back on
track in order to tackle this disease once and for all.  I was met with
knowing nods.  After all this disease is a killer, isn't it?  So began my
recovery once more.  My palpitations settled a bit, but seemed to be
problematic at times, especially when I found myself under stress. I told
myself that I just had to somehow work the program harder, then maybe I
could once again regain my health.

<P>
Kyle was still a fixture at the meeting.  He had put on a bit of weight
since I had last seen him and was now working in some kind of paper store.  He
did not pay me much mind, and I generally avoided him except to say hello.  I'm
not sure what his counseling licensing status was, but it was certain at
this point that the hospital would never have him back.  I noticed that his
sharing at meetings had become a lot more preachy, almost shrill at
times.  Other
than that, not much had changed.  A couple of new faces were there, but they
tended to disappear as quickly as they came.

<P>
I had another bought of palpitations after hooking up with my friend
spontaneously one night.  Although my regular doctor had earlier run a
battery of tests on my heart and declared me fit, I thought that I was
heading to an early grave. I called my sponsor and we talked after a meeting
one night.  He was not surprised this was happening to me, considering all
the chemicals changes that occur when I am acting out on my urges.  I was
ready once again to finally surrender to the program.

<P>
But then I discovered a support forum on line that is dedicated to people
who suffer from atrial fibrillation. The forum's moderator has a an advanced
degree in biology and most of the people contributing to the forum, although
not MD's, do extensive medical research in order to find ways to mitigate
their irregular heart rhythms.  I found out a few things from these good
people.  First of all, my symptoms, although upsetting, were not life
threatening.  This confirmed what my doctor had told me.  Secondly, my
fibrillations, although rare, most often strike men between 40 and 50.  I
was 44 at the time.  Most importantly, the forum members provided me a lot
of advice, subject to my physician's approval, as to how I might mitigate
future episodes.  It came down to taking a few simple supplements such as
magnesium and potassium, minerals that our bodies do not retain as well as
we age. My doctor approved, and I began taking them.  Within weeks the
symptoms had virtually disappeared.  And I continued to enjoy some pretty
hot sex in the meantime, without fibrillations.

<P>
You probably see where I'm heading with all this.  I solved a real problem
using a credible medical source, not a program based on dubious science, run
by at best dubious characters.  I once again began to doubt the efficacy of
the sex program.  I could no longer see using it as a sort of talisman to
chase off evils spirits that existed only in my imagination.  The actual
health issues were best approached using rational methods.  My only solace
in all this was that I came to this conclusion in short order, without the
pain of once again trying the steps and becoming a chronic relapser once
more.

<P>
Then Kyle killed himself.  He had apparently been planning it for a while,
as many do.  He had arranged the bills for his wife, fixed a pump in his
basement that had been needing attention for a while, and informed one of
his pigeons that she should probably seek another sponsor. I found out about
his death from a friend in the program who had found out from Carl.  The
mood at the meeting following Kyle's death was one of shock.  Many did
reminisce about him in a positive light, citing the pearls of wisdom he had
offered over the years, as well as the personal time he had taken to help
others.  I even had one or two nice things to say about him.  It bothered me
a bit when a few members contended that perhaps he had not worked his
program as well as he could have, or that he was not being honest enough.  It
is true that he had been recently laid off from the paper store and had not
told anyone.  He was likely ashamed of yet another failure in his life, and
that pushed him over the edge.  Would those accusing him of not working an
honest program have been able to handle such setbacks themselves?  I hope
they never have to find out.

<P>
I was one of the few group members who attended Kyle's wake.  The turn out
was otherwise very good.  There were obviously a lot of people who had loved
him, both family and friends.  Another group member approached me at the
photo display and quietly asked me how he can permanently erase some stuff
on his computer hard drive before he gives it to his daughter.  I get
questions like that from group members once in a while.  My old sponsor Carl
was at the wake, as well as the pigeon who Kyle had told to find another
sponsor the day before he took his life.  Both were badly shook up.  I truly
felt sorry for them.

<P>
I attended yesterday what is likely to be my last meeting in the sex
fellowship. I hope the previous paragraphs have provided some reasoned
insights for this decision.  So where do I stand on the concept as sex
addiction as a disease?  I'm not sure.  In my case, it's pretty obvious that
shame over my homosexuality caused me to latch onto the disease concept as a
means of prolonging my fruitless struggle against the truth.  I'm not so
sure about others I have met.  The pedophiles present a particularly tragic
case.  They are hated by almost everyone, even other sex addicts.  Do they
have a disease though which makes them more a victim than a perpetrator?  I
have no clue.  I'm just grateful that that's not my thing.  I suppose my
cross-dressing could be seen as a definite sexual disorder. Kyle certainly
thought it was.  However, after starting to have sex with men again, I
almost never engage in that anymore.

<P>
Now to the question that I would be asking at this point if I were reading
this.  How do I reconcile what I am doing with being married?  I can't.  It
is wrong.  I am having sex with men behind my wife's back.  I am using
condoms with them and I also use condoms with my wife.  This is wise.  However,
there is always that chance that something will go wrong.  I might encounter
violence, be exposed, or bring home a skin-based STD.  Truthfully, I believe
my marriage would survive in spite of it.  My wife and I love one another
and the kids are not yet out of the house. There would be irreparable damage
to the relationship however.  I still struggle with all of this.  On the
other hand, I believe I am over the promiscuous phase of my initial coming
out.  I had a lot of years of repressed homo-erotic feelings that needed to
come to the surface.  Over the past month I have only seen my one friend.  I
find him attractive and he likes me a lot too. I hope to have many years of
his companionship.

<P>
So there you have it.  The 12 steps did not help me to overcome my sex
addiction because I do not believe there was addiction there to begin with.
What scares me though is that for a significant period of time I put my
trust in people who either did not have the integrity or the credentials to
help me with my problems.  I was willingly duped.  I don't believe that
there is any overt malice on the parts of people such as Kyle, but I do
believe that most people in fellowships like the one I attended are barely
capable of caring for themselves, let alone others.  It's a classic case of
the blind leading the blind.

<P>
What bothers me more is that so-called professionals are sending people to
these so-called recovery groups.  Based on my experience, I believe that a
few factors are at play here.  First, many, many therapists are members of
12 step programs themselves.  I am not talking about psychiatrists who are
trained MD's, I am talking about people like Kyle who have masters degrees
and state licenses to practice therapy.  I'd like to recount an interesting
story in this regard.  I remember one young fellow who was coming to the
meetings for a while.  He had gotten into a little trouble with child porn,
but nothing bad enough to go to court.  The poor guy had been molested while
in training at a seminary, which was probably a mitigating factor in his
porno problem.  Anyway, while attending the sex fellowship he was also being
cared for by real psychiatrists.  His parents must have had the money to
afford such care.  Anyway, he announced at a meeting one night, to the shock
of the group, that his psychiatrists were introducing him to regular
pornography as a means of helping him mature sexually.  In other words, they
were playing the roles of the big brother that he never had. I have an older
brother, and bless his heart, he was a good source of porn in my formative
years (albeit the heterosexual variety).  The group of course was horrified
that trained medical personnel would be subjecting the young man to
porn.  After
all, isn't this a great problem for many in the fellowship?  Well, maybe for
them, but not for the kid who got diddled by a horny and abusive priest
while he was in seminary. The guy eventually left the group, and from what I
hear he is doing rather well.  So is he recovered or not?  Did he ever have
a disease?  Or did he have some hard knocks which trained medical personnel
helped him to overcome?  I'll never know.

<P>
So back to the therapists who are members, either overtly or covertly, of 12
step programs themselves.  In all likelihood they have experience with
either AA or its sister program, Al-Anon.  These programs may very well have
worked for them, so why wouldn't another program that uses the 12 steps as
its foundation work for their clients?  Now I'm completely side-stepping the
question as to whether 12 step programs help anyone at all.  The few studies
that I have read show that 12 step programs are in fact no more effective
than doing nothing.  I'll leave it at that.  A big reason I think that
professionals send clients to a 12 step program like the one I was in is
that they are offloading the hard work that they would otherwise have to do.
You may have surmised at this point that sexual problems can manifest
themselves in many, many ways.  I don't think that most therapists are
competent or smart enough to handle such complexities.  It might therefore
be more convenient to send someone to a 12 step program and wash your hands
of the issue.  If they come back and say it is not working for them they can
simply be told that maybe it's they who are not working the program
correctly.  Or they can be told to take the cotton out of their ears and put
it in their mouth.  That's worked for a lot of people before, hasn't it?

Hello Mike,
<P>
Thanks for a candid letter. I am also dismayed to see the blind leading the
blind. The idea that someone is qualified to teach others
how to live just because he
practiced 12 steps of an old cult religion for a while is absurd.
But that's the popular belief that is going around. In my case, I got
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">a cocaine-snorting, child-molesting,
Internet-child-pornographer counselor</a>
who was paid by city, state, and federal programs to teach me how to
live &quot;clean and sober&quot;, with a &quot;Higher Power in my
recovery program&quot;.
<P>
Yeh, right.
<P>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
Thank you for publishing your papers on the internet.  I have seven years of
continuous sobriety and was 12-stepped into my first AA meeting.  I was terrified
about my drinking problem and had no idea how to quit.  Although I am thankful to be
sober, I've always felt uncomfortable with AA, its practices and teachings.  At
about 5-1/2 years of sobriety, I mostly quit going to meetings.

<p>
I was 47 when I went into the program and was married for 18 years.  I have three
children.  At my first AA meeting, I met a &quot;spirtual guru&quot; who was well-liked in AA
and was very kind to me.  I fell for him.  I guess I thought he could save me from
myself.  Although I had been in an unhappy marriage for years, I left my angry
husband and three children in the home I had always paid the mortgage on and moved
into an apartment.  My ex would not move out.  For fear that the courts would take
my kids away anyway, I moved out.   Since then, I've gotten divorced, moved back in
with my kids and stayed sober.  Anyway, enough history.

<p>
It it is amazing to me that so much of what you've written has described my exact
feelings about AA.   I was 13-stepped by this &quot;spirtual guru&quot; and found out after
five years of dating that he was cheating on me.  I find it impossible to believe
that lying to people you care about is putting the steps and the principals of the
program into one's daily living.

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
I just wanted to let you know that I've been reading your papers for several months
now and am so glad that you have taken on this project.  This information needs to
be &quot;shared.&quot;  I have over seven years of continuous sobriety but have attended only
a few meetings the last couple of years.  I could never quite get it.  I guess I am
one of those unfortunates and must have been born this way.  So much of what you
have written has validated my feelings about AA.  I was 12-stepped into the
program and 13th-stepped after I got there.  I was frightened and vulnerable in the
beginning of my sobriety and I shouldn't have acted upon my attraction to a
particular &quot;spiritual guru&quot; I met.  As it turns out, he was cheating on me almost
from the beginning.  He is someone who is highly thought of by other members of the
AA club. I became involved with [him] and I totally trusted him.   Yes, I was left
broken-hearted and resentful as hell.   BUT I have never felt powerless or that lack
of power was my dilemma.  It's such bullshit.

<p>

From:  	&quot;Miss Anonymous&quot; <br>
Subject:  	My Experience<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
I've been reading all of the info on your website and right now my head is spinning.
I've been going to alanon on and off for the past two years. I think I knew
something felt off from the very first meeting and my bullsit meter has been blaring
ever since, needless to say I'm done and won't be going back. I think it's appalling
the mind numbing, guilt inducing, EMOTIONAL ABUSE that they propagate. I started
going because of being involved with an EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE, drug using, sex addict
and alcoholic boyfriend who is also a narcissist. Apparently I just jumped from the
fire into the frying pan. I am also the victim of child abuse and have done a lot of
reading on the subject.
<p>
Why on earth are 12 step programs allowed to exist in such
abundance? And go so unchecked?
<p>
I've spent a great deal  of time researching
emotional abuse and narcissism in an attempt to understand why I had been feeling so
bad in my relationship with my alcoholic boyfriend and my family. Not having the
money to spend on a therapist, alanon appeared to be the answer. I've come to
realize I am codependent, and one of the most important steps to my recovery is to
FEEL MY FEELINGS.
<p>
After reading your website for the first time I decided to be
defiant and go to a meeting and talk about my anger and how I thought it was healthy
if it helped me to remove myself from a situation that was dangerous to my emotional
or physical wellbeing. Well after the meeting I was swarmed with long time female
members wanting me to call them and giving the appearance of agreeing with me. One
member hugged me very tightly and talked right in my face and quoted from
<i>The Courage to Change</i>.
That felt aggressive.
<p>
Other things I noticed were several long
time members would appear to be noding off, so I question to myself if they are
praying, but after reading the info on your site I think they must be listening for
the word of God to give them instructions, to do what?!!!!!!!
<p>
Also a few months
back I noticed that one of the long time female members who always talks in a shaky,
sad voice had apparently endured a beating by the black and blue bruising on her
face. It is possible her soon to be ex was the perpetrator but now I'm beginning to
wonder if maybe it was a result of an attempt to leave the&quot;group.&quot; Maybe I'm just
being paranoid.
<p>
Another thing that concerns me is when I first started going I
bought the book <i>&quot;Courage to Change&quot;</i>
and paid by check so now they have my full name,
address and banking number, SO I AM NOT ANONYMOUS. I'm not sure of what extents they
will go to to try and control people.
<p>
Living fairly close to another huge nationwide
cult, I've heard horror stories of how that cult makes it a mission to make the
lives miserable of any member who tries to leave and will doggedly go after them. Do
you have any advice for me since they have all of my personal info?
<p>
I quit going for
several months in between and nothing seemed to happen so I'm hoping that will be
the case this time. Have you heard of any tactics they use when someone quits?
<p>
Please do not print my e mail address. Thanks for providing all of this valuable
information. I would like to know why you decided to reveal the truth about 12 step
programs. Were you or someone close to you hurt by them?
<p>
Anonymous

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Miss Anonymous,
<p>
I don't think you need to be that paranoid. I certainly hope not. I've also heard
stories of members stalking dropouts and trying to get them back, but no stories
of violence.
One not-so-funny story had the Steppers like zombies in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>
(<a href="orange-letters14.html#Living_Dead">here</a>).
I have heard of sponsors blabbing somebody's Fifth Step confession
all over town as revenge for someone quitting the group, but no bank fraud.
So I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.
<p>
And if they even try to mess with your bank account, you can sic the FBI on them.
Bank fraud is a crime that the FBI takes very seriously.
It's one of the easiest ways to go to prison.
Only fools try to rob banks.


<p>
You aren't really suffering from &quot;codependency&quot;, because there is no such disease.
&quot;Codependency&quot; is another 12-Step hoax. It's a made-up condition,
like &quot;dry drunk&quot;. Not real at all, in spite
of the dozens of books that have been written about it.
Andrew Meacham, in
<a href="orange-top10.html#Meacham"><i>Selling Serenity: Life Among the Recovery Stars</i></a>,
described the codependency hoax as, &quot;Invent a non-existent disease, and then
charge a fortune to treat it.&quot;
Also <a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency">see my write-up of codependency here</a>.

<p>
Now you may have some emotional problems that you could use some help with, but obviously
the 12-Step cult is not the place to go for therapy or healing. I'm sure it's more
emotionally damaging than healing.
<p>
I'd start with a real doctor, and if he
doesn't think there is anything medically wrong, perhaps he can refer you to
a counselor or therapist who could help you to work through some issues &#8212;
feelings of paranoia for one, and the lingering damage from childhood abuse for
another.
<p>
If financial conditions prevent you from getting help from a doctor or therapist,
then at least go to some
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005037/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> meetings,
and get a dose of rational thinking that way.

<p>
About the question,<br>
<font color="black">&quot;Were you or someone close to you hurt by them?&quot;</font>,<br>
the answer is yes, but that isn't the major motivation for the web site.<br>
<p>
My real motivation is the knowledge that there is this cultish organization that
is hurting a lot of sick people while
bilking billions of dollars out of our health care system by selling quack medicine
and cult religion as a cure for addictions.
<p>
Here in Oregon, the Oregon Health Plan was so broke that people were
dying because their medications got cut off &#8212; literally dying &#8212; but the
quacks were still collecting their checks for &quot;treating alcoholism
and drug addiction&quot;. I want the remaining money spent on Grandma's medicines,
not wasted on the con artists' fraudulent schemes.
<p>
And I have seen so many people turned off by the so-called &quot;treatment&quot;,
with its required 12-Step meeting attendance. They morosely say,
&quot;It's a cult&quot;, and drop out of the treatment program.
The general public isn't really as stupid as A.A. likes to make them out to be.
<p>
And I won't for a minute accept the A.A. excuse that it's their addictions talking,
and they just want to get high, and they aren't spiritual enough,
and they can't be rigorously honest, and they were just
born that way.

I forgot to mention, I like you didn't do the steps or get a sponser either, Thank
God, no pun intended. I'm just now reading your personal experience in AA. This is
just so sad that they really do have a hidden agenda and their techniques can be

or coerced into having sex with the dominate male members. Can't the FBI or some
investigative organization plant someone in the program to see what really goes on?

<p>

Hi again, Miss Anonymous,
<p>
That is tricky. The police in Washington DC and Maryland are investigating Mike Q.'s
&quot;<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">Midtown Group</a>&quot;,
but they cannot legally infiltrate and spy on meetings because that
would amount to spying on a church service, since so many judges have ruled
that Alcoholics Anonymous is a religion. There are very strict laws that
limit police powers in the USA. The police would love to nail the elder
sponsors in the Midtown Group for statutory rape, but the girls keep on declaring
that they are 16 or older, and the police can't quite get the goods on the
criminals.
<p>
Another problem is that the FDA regulates medicines, but not treatment.
You can set up a clinic that declares that yoga and a strange diet will give
you prolonged life, and the FDA can't bust you for it.
(But if you sell &quot;eternal youth pills&quot;, then they can and will arrest you
for selling quack medicine.)
And you can set up a clinic that declares that a bizarre old pro-Nazi cult religion
has the answer to alcoholism, and the Feds can't bust you for it.
In fact, you might qualify for Federal funding for &quot;helping addicts&quot;.

<p>
What we can do though is keep on bugging our politicians, at both the state and
Federal level, and get them to insert clauses in funding bills that require
proof of efficacy for drug and alcohol treatments.  That is, before those quacks
get paid by the city, state, or Federal governments, and before those quacks
get any health insurance money, they must prove that their treatment is
significantly better than the alcoholics getting no treatment at all.

<p>
So far, A.A.-based treatment has never passed such a test. Just the opposite.
A.A. failed every time, and proved itself to be very harmful &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">much worse than no treatment at all</a>.

<p>
So demanding proof of efficacy looks like a very promising approach.
<p>
And above all, just keep writing to your state and Federal Senators and Congresspersons,
just to keep them aware of the fact that somebody cares, and somebody is watching,
and the voters are concerned about the issue.

I agree with AA has become a cult.  And the Cult mentality has bred a more dangerous
ground for people seeking a solution to drug and alcohol addition.  But don't throw
the baby out with the bath water.  I was fortunate enough coming in and out of AA
for 5 years to find someone who had some success, what not cultish and who was able
to give me the guidance I needed to become centered through a spiritual awakening.
AA had as much success as the 5 rehabs prior to my enlightenment.  AA is full of
sick degenerates who prey on one another, but there is light in that darkness.

Hello Thomas,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
When you say,
<font color="black">
&quot;But don't throw the baby out with the bath water&quot;</font>,
I don't think there is any baby in that bath water.
<p>
It is great that you got a wonderful mentor to help you with your problems,
but A.A. has no monopoly on good mentors. In fact, your odds of finding such
help in A.A. are not too good. You were lucky, very lucky. I've received letters
from people who had to search for years to find a sane mentor in A.A.,
going through very unhappy experiences
with nutty sponsors time after time before they got lucky.
<p>
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers">The majority of A.A. is
mentally disturbed people</a> who need help, not wise compassionate gurus ready
to give sane help.
<p>
I get far more stories of people being exploited
and abused by psychos than happy stories of good helpers.
In fact, just a few letters back,
<a href="orange-letters115.html#Amy_D">a woman was telling me</a>
about how her &quot;spiritual&quot; mentor 13th-stepped her and then
deceived her and cheated on her for five years.
And do I have to mention <a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the
Midtown Group</a> again?

<p>
Then you assume that your success and spiritual experience
or spiritual awakening was due to Alcoholics Anonymous.
That is normal, but wrong. People often go through one negative
experience after another as they try to quit a bad habit,
failing time and again to break the habit because they aren't really
resolved to quit it, until they finally get so sick and tired of
being sick and tired that they really do quit. And they work themselves into a highly
suggestible mental state that Dr. Edgar H. Schein called
&quot;<a href="orange-cultinfo.html">unfreezing</a>&quot;, where the
personality is fluid and changeable.
They often go through profound transformational experiences in the process.
Then they erroneously attribute the experience to whatever they happened
to be doing at the time. Whatever program they were in at that minute gets the credit.

<p>
A former Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., recognized this
tendency (before he became an A.A. Trustee):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Another root of Professional-AA strains consists of the very human
tendency to be loyal to the therapy which has been successful in one's own case &#8212;
and rather uncritically to adopt the ideological framework within which the help
has come. We see this phenomenon in other areas. For example, the benefits of
religious faith and personal integration can come through many different theological
frames of reference &#8212; Roman Catholic, Pentacostal, Christian Science, Theosophy,
Zen Buddhism, you name it. And, so often, the help found is taken as absolute
proof of the truth of the accompanying theological framework. Or, witness what
happens when a patient has shopped around from doctor to doctor, and finally finds one
that helps: he becomes very loyal to the successful therapist &#8212; and to the successful
therapeutic program. Why should the behavior of alcoholics be so different? I've
been in alcoholism clinic and hospital settings where I've heard: &quot;I tried the
'cure' over there. I tried AA. None of it worked. But this place has got the
answers.&quot;
<font color="#8f0000">
And I've heard alcoholics talk who had boxed the professional compass
and finally made it in AA. In either case, the reason for the success of the
particular treatment may have been due more to the patient's by-now greater pain and
desperation than to the nature of the treatment or the context of beliefs.
But few
patients can see this at the time and they become loyal to the &quot;successful therapy&quot; &#8212;
and, unfortunately, sometimes antagonistic or unfavorable in their attitude toward
other therapeutic programs.
</font>
Now, I submit that this is quite standard human behavior.
But it is one of the roots of misunderstanding, distrust, and strain in AA-professional
relations.<br>

is also wrong except that there is no psychology &#8212; it's just cultish
superstitions like &quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">the dry drunk</a>&quot;
and &quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency">codependency</a>&quot;
and &quot;<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">the need to surrender</a>&quot;,
and &quot;you drink because you have unconfessed sins&quot; and
&quot;you drink because you have defects of character and moral shortcomings&quot;,
and &quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality">you drink because
you have a nagging wife</a>&quot;.
<li>
Then of course there is the falsified history and the refusal to speak
the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous and Bill Wilson.
<li>
Then
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">the constant put-downs</a>
are very harmful and depressing and occasionally drive someone to suicide.
<li>
Then there is the lying about the success rate, and trying to hide the fact
that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">A.A. basically does not have a success rate</a>.

<li>
And then there is the giant problem that the actual results of 12-Step treatment
of alcoholism are very negative &#8212; A.A.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">raises the rate of rearrests</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">increases the costs of hospitalization later</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raises the death rate</a> in alcoholics.
You are really betting your ass when you go to A.A.
</ol>
<p>
A few good mentors don't make up for all of the fatal flaws and evils of A.A.
Those few good mentors would do well to move to another organization like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005037/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="newwin1">SMART</a>
or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005037/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="newwin2">SOS</a>
or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005037/http://www.unhooked.com/index.htm" target="newwin3">LifeRing</a>
or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005037/http://www.womenforsobriety.org/" target="newwin4">WFS</a>
where they can tell the truth and dispense
some more logical advice.
<p>
Since A.A. doesn't want to be reformed, the best thing to do is shut it down
and keep it from harming more people. It's time for A.A. to join the medical
relics of history like blood-letting, leeches, the snake pit, and Freud's
psychoanalysis couch.

<p>
Have a good day.
