Hi Leslie,
<p>
Thanks for the note. Yes, a &quot;Monkey Puzzle Tree&quot;. And the web tells me that they are
native to South America. I guess they must live up in the Andes, because this one is
thriving in northern Oregon, and it isn't killed by the winter freezes.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters397.html#Minah" target="_blank">The thing about the Minah Fish</a>
was just a joke, a spoof. It occurred to me while I was
thinking about a TV program that I saw on Public Television &#8212; I think about Lyre Birds.
It turns out that they are world-class mimics, much better than parrots. The best footage
that they had was a Lyre Bird who, when the photographer aimed a video camera at the bird,
responded by mimicking the sound of a 35mm film camera with an electric motor film winder.
The bird looked the photographer right in the eye, and opened his mouth, and said,
&quot;Click!-Whirrr...  Click!-Whirrr...&quot;
The little bird had it down pat, and he clearly understood that cameras make that sound,
so, when he saw another camera pointed at him, he played back the sound.
<p>
And yes, the male Lyre Birds play their repertoire of sounds in front of the females
in order to impress them. They really are like rock stars showing off in front of the girls.
The male Lyre Birds act just like the male Minah Fish that I described.

<p>
I was thinking about that while the evening TV news was talking about the pings
from the lost airplane, and the two stories just kind of ran together in my
imagination. Is it really true? I doubt it, but it's
just crazy enough to be true. If birds can mimic sounds, why can't fish?

<p>
The fish would be loud enough, I think. The sound from the pinger is really, really weak,
especially because the plane will be at the bottom of the ocean, about two miles down,
and the ships with hydrophones are on the surface. They have to use very powerful amplifiers
and amplify microscopically tiny sounds a lot to be able to hear those black boxes.
They can't even have any other ships in the area or the noise from the other ship
will drown out the pinging sound.  
So a fish with a weak ping can easily sound as loud as a black box that is two miles away.
<p>
And a ship that is listening for distant pings can't necessarily
 tell whether the sound is coming from
a black box two miles down or a fish a few hundred feet down.
If the ship is moving, the listener can notice that the sound comes on and fades away too
fast when it is coming from a nearby fish. A sound from a pinger two miles down will
not change in intensity much as the ship moves over its position, but the sound from
a fish a few hundred feet down will.
But that kind of discrimination is very tricky when they are struggling to hear anything
at all, and they routinely loose the sound because it is so faint and so far away,
and they think they are hearing the same black box at positions hundreds of miles apart.

<p>
If there really is such a thing as a Minah Fish, it's going to make locating the black
boxes doubly difficult.
In the future, they would need to make the black boxes produce sounds that cannot be copied by a fish,
or make the boxes transmit something that can be easily recognized as a copy.
My best guess is: transmit the current time and date
in Morse code along with the pinging. If a Minah Fish is just repeating what he hears, then
he will be sending out yesterday's time and date, not the current time.
That will enable the hydrophone operator to distinguish between black boxes and Minah Fish
voicing copies of yesterday's pings.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	Toward better understanding<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,
<p>
Glad to hear from you. Congratulations on your thirteen years of sobriety; so much the better. The former congrats
must have been based on an old letter. That you recovered without AA is unimportant to me, the fact that you have
succeeded is and it is not my place to judge. It is not my place to &quot;argue or retaliate&quot; but to find some common ground,
to close the apparent gap between us and to arrive at better understanding. So please accep that I am relatingmy own
experiences and the beliefs I hold as the result of these.

<p>
The Spanish artist Goya said, &quot;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&quot; I would offer that beauty is also in the ear of the
beholder and is generally a matter of perception. The principle of the First Step is Honesty and another point I've made
at meetings is that I have always been honest: that is to say I've always been true to my beliefs. If I believed that &quot;they&quot;
were out to get me (I was once diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, and on another occasion as a psychopath), my
actions were conditioned by that belief. In that state of mind, when I was arrested countless times, confined to mental
institutions ( three times), and indicted by a Grand Jury in New York (May 1972), the effect was not to dissuade me from
my beliefs but only served to confirm them. They were really out to get me!
<p>
Beliefs are what they are; firmly held regardless of their holder's view of reality. People who serve in the military believe
they are &quot;serving their country&quot;; in Breakfast of Champions, Kurt Vonnegut refers to it as &quot;indoctrination in homicide
and Socialism.&quot; Your reference to &quot;brainwashing&quot; is valid in some circumstances but not all. The Second Step says
&quot;Came to believe&quot; not &quot;Made to believe&quot; and I hold with the former. I've heard other members say, &quot;Brainwashing?
My brain needed a good washing.&quot; The many times I went back to drinking over the fifteen years of struggling it was
because I believed that AA was trying to brainwash me. I wouldn't be brainwashed, yet I came to believe.
<p>
One misconception I held to the very end was that the solution to any problem had to be perfect: it doesn't. Over the
past thirty years I have ridden a bicycle the equivalent of one and a half times around the Equator. My 1984 Gitane
10-speed is my sole means of getting about; it keeps me fit and healthy despite my 75 years. I keep my bicycle in
good repair as I rely on it for transportation (if I need a car I just rent one). Once, when I was heading home from
my office, a distance of four miles, the derailleur on the bicycle I had then broke. The pedal only turned halfway
but I still made it home using what pedal was available. It wasn't perfect but it worked. That is my position on AA.
<p>
While I certainly agree that there are flaws in the program that I strive to address, the recovery I enjoy today the
result of identifying these anomalies and finding a higher truth in the process. Another way of putting it: it takes three
tons of ore to mine an ounce of gold. It's just a matter of digging, or scraping a hole in a concrete floor with a spoon.
<p>
So, it's all about believing and while I agree that brainwashing is an abomination, it is not the only was to condition
belief. There is also the &quot;placebo effect&quot; that has seen many recover from serious illnesses and diseases.
<p>
So, as we are on opposite sides of the fence regarding AA, I hope that these discussion may serve to lower the
fence that we may arrive at a better mutual understanding. Peace.
<p>
Your Friend,<br>
George

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, George,
<p>
Actually, I don't think we differ much in our opinions of A.A.  We agree on so many things,
like that it is a big mistake to just shove a big bundle of superstitious beliefs and
goofy instructions at the newcomers and demand that they just obey orders and do what
they are told.
We agree that understanding is important.
We agree that speaking the truth is desireable.
We agree that faith healing and expecting miracles on demand is insanity.
We agree that worshipping any old stone idol or group of drunks as &quot;God&quot; is both crazy and
heretical.
We agree that many, perhaps most, of the A.A. oldtimers resent being told the truth
whenever it differs from their favorite notions, and that is not a good thing.
<p>
In fact, the only glaring point of disagreement is whether &quot;the program&quot; works and produces
good results. But you have discarded so much of &quot;the program&quot; that I wonder what your idea
of &quot;the program&quot; really is.
It sure isn't the standard package of beliefs that the regular A.A. oldtimers are selling.
Your program isn't the 12 Steps, and it isn't sitting on your duff and expecting Higher
Power to be your butler.
Your program isn't &quot;having faith&quot; or believing in God.
So what exactly is your program, and how does it work?
<p>
I noticed your mention of the placebo effect. Alas, that doesn't work either.
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant (the future A.A. Trustee)
was also hoping that the placebo effect would heal alcoholics.
In his famous book, <b><i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i></b> (1983),
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_cure" target="_blank">he stated that his goal was</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In other words, if we can but combine
the best placebo effects of acupuncture, Lourdes, or Christian Science
with the best attitude change inherent in the evangelical conversion
experience, we may be on our way to an effective alcoholism program.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, it sounded good, but it didn't work at all. After 8 years of using A.A. on his
alcoholic patients, and testing A.A. and trying to make it work, 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant had to report</a>
that A.A. produced a zero-percent improvement in the sobriety of alcoholics.
What the A.A. program really accomplished was
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raising the death rate in alcoholics</a>.

<p>
Then there is the problem of belief. You mentioned that word repeatedly.
Coincidentally, here in Portland Oregon we have some really dangerous believers.
They call themselves <a href="orange-letters265.html#Followers" target="_blank">the Followers of Christ Church</a>.
They fervently believe in faith healing. They refuse to take their children to the
doctor when they are sick. They literally let their children die without medical care.
They let their children die from treatable conditions.
That has happened repeatedly, for years.
The local district attorney finally got fed up and started filing manslaughter charges
against the parents. One court case had just recently concluded with the father getting
a few years in prison and the mother getting probation (so that she could care for
the surviving children), when yet another couple of parents killed one of their children
by depriving the child of medical care,
and another whole court case circus began. They stubbornly refuse to learn and change their
ways.  They are convinced that they are right and everybody else is wrong, and if
the child dies, well, that was just the Will of God.

<p>
Believing that A.A. really works to cure alcoholics (or &quot;help, but not cure&quot;)
presents the same problem. The evidence shows that A.A. does not work. And the faith-healing
attitudes of some A.A. members who insist that
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">people should not take their doctor-prescribed
medications</a>
&#8212; trust the 12 Steps to heal them &#8212; is just the most extreme aspect
of the A.A. faith-healing beliefs. 
A.A. has killed many people with that insane belief.

<p>
Personally, I have no faith in faith. I don't believe in belief. I believe in &quot;Learn the
truth, and the truth shall set you free.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	Article on Bill Wilson<br>

<p>
Friend, your article on Bill Wilson was quite profound and was well researched.   You had plenty enough fact and supporting data without all the extenuated judgmentalism, however.  Subject to the ranting undertones, it would have been easy to dismiss, had it not been so well founded in supporting data.  I believe your major points to be invaluable to members of  'alcoholics anonymous', in seeing their own denial and self justifying behavior (if their founder could be so susceptible, should they not watch for this in themselves?).
<p>
  All I have to say it is certainly wise they call themselves Alcoholics Anonymous, and have no members 'greater or better' than others, as, if they followed Wilson's lead, rather than their shared recovery experience, they would certainly fall apart and cease to serve.  Thank You for presenting what is, no doubt, a very controversial article, but on a subject that certainly needs spoken. I had researched many of the same items, earlier, but You performed with far more proficiency in that area.
<p>
  As far as Bill Wilson, and so many other 'spiritual teacher/leaders', I have always observed how a man of great contribution will so often have all his fatal flaws dismissed or rationalized as acceptable for any number of inane and insane reasons, almost as if a flawed person could make no sizable contribution. Hence the almost frenzied attempts of the 'students/adherents' to cover or dismiss the detrimental actions their leaders were guilty of.  In humor, I quip this phenomena as, &quot;There is nothing more Sacred than a dead guru.&quot;

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I agree with you on AA and the 'treatment' industry. It amazes me how you have had the patience to keep going, particularly when you have to deal with a great deal of provocation day in day out.

<p>
One of the reasons I keep coming back to the site is your scholarship. In other words, your dispassionate approach and findings based on evidence, rather than conjecture or inappropriate speculation, sits well with me.

<p>
So, I ask myself why you constantly use the National Socialist regime of '30s and '40s Germany as the barometer of all that is evil. You must be well aware that the evidence for gas chambers, a programme for genocide, etc is laughably thin, surely? Canada had two huge trials in the '80s of a man called Ernst Zundel and so-called holocaust denial which showed how emotion, rather than evidence, dominates that subject. Why would you be so keen to dispel the myth of AA using another, far greater and far more fraudulent, myth? Surely, that is intellectual dishonesty or laziness?

<p>
All the best, Orange.

Hello Eva,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. But wow! The evidence for the gas chambers is
not &quot;thin&quot;. There are mountains of evidence &#8212; entire libraries of evidence.
The Allies were running movie cameras as they liberated some of those concentration
camps, and the documentation is overwhelming.
The story of the holocaust is not a &quot;myth&quot;.
<p>
We also have the entire German archives of documents &#8212; immense archives.
The Germans were meticulous record-keepers, and it is often possible to track a
specific Jewish family from a certain city address to a certain train on a
certain date to Therisienstadt, and then later taking another train to Auschwitz.
Those archives still exist, and were just opened to the public. They were sealed for 50 years
after the war, but times' up.
So both you and I can go read them, and I would if I had the money for a vacation in
Germany.

<p>
We even have the transcripts of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials where some of the Nazis on trial
described in their own words how the factory of death worked.
<p>
Unfortunately, there are some people who don't wish to believe that it really happened, so
they make false claims that the evidence is bad, or weak, or that it is all just a Jewish
conspiracy. In the paragraph above, you implied that the evidence was thin because people
were very emotional at a Holocaust Denier's trial. Those two things have nothing to do
with each other. Some people being very emotional about things like mass murder and genocide
does not change the validity of the evidence one way or the other.
The evidence stands on it's own merits, and the evidence is so immense, so complete and
detailed, that it is unquestionable.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters374.html#Himmler" target="_blank">Just recently, I got ahold of a book of trial transcripts of doctors</a>
who performed unethical medical experiments on Jews in the concentration camps:<br>
<blockquote>
<i>Croix gamm&eacute;e contre caduc&eacute;e
&#8212; Les Experiences Humaines En Allemagne Pendant La Deuxieme Guerre
Mondiale</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Francois Bayle.<br>
 That is,
&quot;The Swastika versus the Caduceus &#8212; The Human Experiments In
Germany During The Second World War&quot;.<br>
Published by Centre De L'Imprimerie Nationale a Neustadt (Palatinat), 1950.<br>
8 volumes, 1521 pages. French language.
</blockquote>
<p>
You should try reading it. &#8212;An English translation, that is, which is available.

<p>
I do not regard the Nazis as the only measure of immorality, but they are certainly
one yardstick by which to measure evil.  
The reason that I keep going back to the Nazis is because they are inseparable from the
subject of A.A.  Any time we discuss the theology of A.A., we have to include the theology
of Dr. Frank Buchman, whose teachings Bill Wilson parrotted. And
<a href="orange-rroot480.html" target="_blank">Buchman just pushed a Fascist/Nazi philosophy</a>:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The average man is unfit to think for himself, and he should just obey the orders of his superiors.
<li> Hence democracy is undesireable. The average man is not fit to vote. So Buchman sold
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_authoritarian" target="_blank">a pseudo-democracy</a>
which he called
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#true_democracy" target="_blank">&quot;inspired democracy&quot;
and &quot;true democracy&quot;</a>,
where nobody voted, and everybody just obeyed Buchman.
Frank Buchman simultaneously declared that he was giving people
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot300.html#true_dictatorship" target="_blank">the true dictatorship of the living God</a>&quot;,
and &quot;<a href="orange-rroot480.html#theocratic_dictatorship" target="_blank">the dictatorship of the spirit of God</a>&quot;.
It takes some fancy semantic tap-dancing to reconcile &quot;true democracy&quot;
and &quot;true dictatorship&quot;.

<li> The highest patriotism consists of unthinking obedience of the leader's orders.
<li> People who have liberal or left-wing politics are Communists.
<li> As Paul Diener pointed out, Fascisms were health and purity movements.
<li> Fascisms sold &quot;spirituality&quot; and purity as alternatives to the bread-and-butter
issues of the leftists and trade unions. And labor unions were bad because they were
&quot;materialistic&quot;.
<li>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">The end justifies the means</a>.
(&quot;It's okay to lie to people and deceive them in order to win them for God.&quot;)
<li> Those who disagreed with the Buchmanites were
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#Campbell_Howard_01" target="_blank">morally defective <i>Untermenschen</i></a>.
<li> And although they hid it and downplayed it,
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Hardinge6" target="_blank">Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot;
was actually quite anti-Semitic</a>.
</ul>
<p>
That is on top of the fact that
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">Buchman liked to hobnob with the leading Nazis</a>
and attended Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and the 1936 Berlin Olympics as the personal guest of
the Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler. And then Buchman came home and declared to a New York
daily newspaper that he thanked Heaven for giving us a man like Adolf Hitler.

<p>
I don't consider the Nazis &quot;the barometer of all that is evil.&quot;
I also criticize the Communists, and Scientology, the Moonies, the Hari Krishnas,
Rev. Jim Jones' Peoples' Temple, and numerous other cults. It is entirely possible
that Stalin actually killed more people than Hitler did. It's a close contest. Both
got between 40 and 50 million people killed. Both Hitler and Stalin were evil monsters.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	Terry<br>

<p>
Another website told you might have some advice me, here is what I wrote them:
<p>
<blockquote>
I found myself with my back against a wall and no way out. After to talking to a friend he recommended I go to a detox facility and he would help me get into a half-way house.
<p>
Right away, while in detox I noticed something was wrong. I was visited by several people who told me the 12 steps are the only way to remain sober and handed me a big book.
The situation reminded me of other religious groups who actively promote their views.
<p>
Once I got to the half-way house the guys there were very welcoming and tried to make me feel comfortable.
They told me the rules and routines, at this point I was just grateful to not be on the streets (I lost my house).
The issue arose during &quot;Morning Meditation&quot;, when everybody reads a paragraph from the big book and chants prayers in unison.
Being an atheist I found this disturbing and decided not to say the prayers one morning. Another member of the house observed me not reciting the mandatory prayers and told the house manager, who made me write the prayers several times (I have the threat of being kicked out on the streets always hanging over my head).
<p>
In addition, to mind manipulation the house provided me with a new job at a local flooring company working in the office. I was told if I leave the program I lose my job.
The job only pays enough for me to eat and pay &quot;rent&quot; every week, leaving me depending on the house and AA to stay off the streets. I need some advice on a way out, without having to go to a homeless shelter (I have never been in a situation like this before). I would work a second job but I am prohibited from doing so or go on Food Stamps to save money, but that also is prohibited.

Hello Ian,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about the troubles that
you are in. That is the classic &quot;halfway house&quot; trap: It amounts to
white slavery. You pay exhorbitant rent for a bunk (I'll bet that
it is not a private room)
in a &quot;safe and sober&quot; house, and
you work for a cult member for substandard
wages, which the halfway house confiscates for rent and food, and you
never get ahead. You can't possibly save up enough money to move out
and get your own place when you need first and last months' rent and a
damage deposit to move into any apartment.
You can be their slave for many years.
<p>
And they have no legal right to forbid you to get food stamps. That is also
part of the scheme to keep you dirt poor and trapped in their religion.
Now I'm sure they mask their intentions by slinging some slogan like
&quot;You should be self-supporting&quot;,
but their real motive is  still to keep you trapped in poverty and
in their religion.
That is also why they don't want you getting a second job. If you make
enough money, you will move out and escape from their cult.

<p>
In the end, the only answer is to walk out of there.  One way or another,
that is the answer. Just pack up your things and walk out.
<p>
Now it will be far more comfortable, healthy, and convenient if you can
immediately
walk into a good situation with a roof over your head and a good job,
but that may be dreaming. With the economy and unemployment what it is, even
qualified, educated, people with no drug and alcohol history can't get jobs.

<p>
I can't recommend the homeless shelter unless you are getting rained on
a lot. It's healthier to camp out in a field.
My experience with homeless shelters is that you will be sick
as a dog with five kinds of colds and flues within a week of going into
a homeless shelter. The guys in the shelter fan out and travel all around
the city during the day, and then they come home to the shelter at
night and give you all of the diseases that they collected during the
day. My first time in such a shelter in the winter of 2000, I came down
with colds, flues, bronchitis and pneumonia. But at least that gave
me the motivation to quit smoking. I just couldn't both smoke and breathe
any more.

<p>
Now I would like to think that you are not alone in this.
There must be some good people somewhere who would like to help.
I'm going to post this letter on the web site and forum and also
Facebook, and see what other people can suggest or offer.
But first, I need to know what city you are in.
Whether some people can help depends on that.
(Then again, perhaps you could move to another city. That is also
a possibility.)
So please tell me where you are.
<p>
I would also look into what the local social agencies have to offer.
You might also want to talk to the local Department of Labor people
about the white slavery issue, and you could also talk to the local district
attorney's office. I know that what is being done to you is illegal.
(It's really a very old scheme that has been used on all kinds of
underpaid workers: Just pay them enough to survive, but not enough
to be able to get out.)

<p>
And have a good day anyway.

I'm amazed that I've seen just another church bound person, so fearful of the truth that he spent page after page 'attempting' to disparage Alcoholics Anonymous. You obviously are ignorant. and are one of the many who chose to stay ignorant, in the hope that everyone else will see &quot;A. Orange's Light&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Carl,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the opinions. Alas, you seem to be talking about
someone else. I am not a &quot;church-bound&quot; person. Odd how A.A. members
claim that they are not in conflict with other religions, and then
they snear at other believers and call them &quot;church-bound&quot;.
<p>
 The funny thing is, the other
A.A. members who aren't accusing me of being a religious fanatic are
busy calling me an atheist.
<p>
And I am not ignorant. I have spend many years studying cults, including
A.A. Check out
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">the bibliography</a>,
just for starters. There is a very good chance that I have read more
A.A. &quot;council-approved&quot; books than you have.

</font>
<p>
In the first place, every single principle applied in AA can be found in the Bible. The Bible that you believe that you know. Would you like me to school you on those facts? True intellectuals, that you seem to think that you are, have looked at AA with an open mind, which your Christ was a great proponent of. The fact is, you wouldn't dare have a conversation with a true intellectual who is Spiritually Awake.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. That is a common claim, and it is 100% wrong. What A.A. members do
is scan through the Bible and try to find a few sentences that sound
sort of like the 12 Steps, and then claim that the 12 Steps are based on
the Bible. No, they aren't.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
 The 12 Steps are based on the cult recruiting
and indoctrination practices of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>,
the founder of the religious cult to which Bill Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith,
and Clarence Snyder belonged.
<p>
A.A. and its 12 Steps are grossly heretical and unBiblical.
Nowhere does the Bible say that you can worship a <b>Group Of Drunks</b> as
your &quot;GOD&quot;.
You can see far more about such anti-Christian aspects of the 12 Steps here:
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</i></a>.
</font>
<p>
You bad mouth prayer and meditation. Jesus prayed and meditated continuously, why? Who told him to pray and meditate? Could it be he did it because it worked, and he received answers that although he did not like, he followed. Christians say that he willfully allowed himself to be mutilated and murdered, where did the 'authority' for those acts come from? Intentional suicide is a sin in your little churchworld. Tell me where they originated, since you are afraid of meditation and hence he could not have received his instructions from prayer and meditation.

<p>
<font color="blue">
 You think you will get your wishes granted by praying
to some Rock or Doorknob Almighty or Group Of Drunks?
That is insane.
<p>
It worked?  Let's see, Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemene
to be saved, and he got crucified. The Jews in Auschwitz prayed to be saved
and they got gassed and burned. What worked?
</font>
<p>
Since you have never had a Spiritual Awakening, I'm sure that you avoid doing what is necessary to have an Awakening at all cost. So you conveniently skip over steps 4 and 5. Would you like for me to point out where those two steps are in the Bible?. Step 3 is merely a demonstration of, '......faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen'.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are assuming things about which you know nothing. You don't know
anything about my religious history or my experiences, so you should not
be proclaiming that I never had a religious or spiritual experience.
<p>
Steps 4 and 5 are a big part of the A.A. guilt-induction routine, which
is
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">essential for brainwashing</a>.
 Jesus never told you to do Steps 4 and 5.
Rather, he said, &quot;Be of good cheer&quot;.  It was
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#St_James" target="_blank">
St. James who wrote one little sentence about &quot;Confess your faults
one to another&quot;</a>,
and that turned out to be a huge mistake.
The Catholic Church now has a strict ban on public confessions.

</font>
<p>
One final thing, and the most important of all; if and when you ever have a Spiritual Awakening, you will then 'see'. Believe me when I say that every time you open your mouth and demonize anything that you do not understand, the people who do understand are laughing at your ignorance.

<p>
Very Sincerely, Carl B.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Carl,
<p>
I've already had quite a number of experiences. And I learned that people
who join cults and become true believers in cults
 are deluded, and have not had a genuine Spiritual Experience.

Hint, maybe YOU could develop a non 12 step approach to alcohol and drug addiction, then you could speak in positive terms instead of raking mud, and wasting precious oxygen in the process... Sick to death of the shit people like you spew... get a life.

Hello Rosemary,
<p>
Thanks for the sentiments. My motivation is very simple: to get the truth
out there for all to see. A.A. is quack medicine and false religion that
hurts a lot of sick people who need something better, like the truth,
just for a change.

<p>
I did not &quot;fail Step 1&quot;. I never did the 12 Steps, and I never had a
sponsor, and I don't believe in Bill Wilson or the <i>Big Book</i>.
I quit drinking my own way, and I have 13 years clean and sober now.
I even have 13 years off of cigarettes, which is something that
Bill Wilson never accomplished.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	New AA argument against your website<br>

<p>
Terrance, the latest argument I heard against your website is that you refused to do what your sponsor asked you to do and are still smoking pot daily. Also, Clancy I. is speaking in Bloomington, MN on 5/24 &amp; 5/25. Let's make him squirm!

Hi Dan,
<p>
Thanks for the note. Now that is amusing. It's funny how people who practice
&quot;The Four Absolutes&quot;, including &quot;Absolute Honesty&quot;,
have such a propensity for making things up out of thin air.
<p>
I never had a sponsor, so no way could I disobey &quot;my sponsor&quot;.
<p>
It's also sad to see how much it upsets them for someone to succeed
in quitting drinking and drugging without their goofy religion.
<p>
Perhaps they are also upset that I ruin their
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">fear-mongering</a>.
I am living proof that they are completely wrong when they
declare that you must do the 12 Steps or else you
will die drunk in a gutter.

<p>
I haven't smoked any pot in 13 years. I actually had my last hit
of pot a couple of weeks before I quit drinking (Oct. 20, 2000).
I didn't &quot;officially&quot; quit smoking pot then, I just didn't
have any more pot and never got around to getting more. Then, when I
quit drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco, I decided to also quit all drugs
and make a clean sweep of it. And I think that was a wise choice.
<p>
Actually, it wasn't entirely choice: I came down with bronchitis and
pneumonia so bad that I couldn't breath and smoke at the same time.
That made quitting smoking pretty easy. Not much choice.
<p>
Now, I refrain from smoking pot because I don't want to mess up my clean
lungs even a tiny little bit. Pot isn't nearly as harmful as tobacco,
but putting any smoke in your lungs is less than perfectly healthy.
(Heck, you shouldn't even inhale a lot of dust. Coal dust, for example,
gives miners Black Lung Disease.)

<p>
Also, since I haven't smoked pot in 13 years, if I was to smoke it now,
I'd get high as a kite. You'd have to peel me off of the ceiling.
I'd want to smoke a cigarette and have a beer just to calm down and
make the room stop spinning. And that would be a disaster.
<p>
Beyond that, there is also clarity. Having taken no mind-altering
drugs in 13 years
produces a nice mental clarity. I don't feel like giving up the clarity
just to get a buzz for a few hours.
(And that applies equally to both pot and alcohol.)

<p>
So here I am, clean and sober as a virgin tea-totaller.  So it goes.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Re: reply from Orange Papers<br>

<p>

Actually we do have records of a sort. We are on Facebook and in touch for the significant
events in each others lives.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Thomas,
<p>
Thanks for the response. Alas, you don't seem to understand what records are.
Trading messages on Facebook does not prove, show, indicate, or even hint
that 80% of the people who joined A.A. 30 years ago are still sober,
like you claimed. In fact, Facebook did not exist 30 years ago.

<p>
Records are things like attendance records:
<p>
<b>&quot;Joe Blow joined on July 8, 1984, and left on Sept. 20, 1984.&quot;</b>
<p>
Now that is a record. You need one such item for every newcomer for the
years in question.

</font>
<p>
AA is an anymomous program that does not keep paper records do it does not lend itself to
qualitative studies.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I know that they don't keep records. That is what I said before.
You have zero evidence to back up your claim that A.A. &#8212; or at least your
group &#8212; has an 80% success rate.

</font>
<p>
But we have many anecdotal stories which qualify as scientific when qualitative studies
are not available.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Anecdotal stores are worthless. That is a standard propaganda trick:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof by Anecdote</a>.<p>
And that is what the <i>Big Book</i> is: Just a mess of proof-by-anecdote
propaganda stories.

<p>
The FDA &#8212; the Federal Food and Drug Administration &#8212;
refuses to accept
any anecdotal evidence as &quot;proof&quot; that a medicine or treatment works.
The only acceptable proof is valid, carefully-performed
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>.

</font>
<p>
Also these many anecdotal studies could be brought together in a meta analysis.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Collecting more anecdotal stories and calling it a &quot;meta-analysis&quot; is just
another propaganda trick. It's quite invalid.
The plural of &quot;anecdote&quot; is not &quot;evidence&quot;.
<p>
What about all of the stories of failure that you didn't bother to write down
or save? How will you include them in such a &quot;meta-analysis&quot;?
Without accurate records recording ALL cases of success and failure, you have
no valid evidence. And you just said that you don't keep records.

</font>
<p>
All I can say AA has worked for me and many people I've known. You cannot invalidate my
experience.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I disagree. You have presented zero evidence that A.A. worked for you.
If you actually quit drinking, then I would give the credit to will power
and determination, and maybe a little common sense, not to
 the practices of Dr. Frank Buchman's old cult religion.
 A.A. has a miserable track record when it comes to
sobering up alcoholics, so there is no reason to believe that it did
anything good.

<p>
Like Carl Sagan said,
<b>&quot;Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.&quot;</b>
To claim that practicing an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties cures alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction is a very extraordinary claim.
</font>
<p>
What's your problem anyways AA did nothing to you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, A.A. has hurt a lot of my friends, acquaintances, and correspondents.
Read these:
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">A.A. Horror Stories</a>.
<p>
Foisting quack medicine on sick people and lying to them about how
well it works is a despicable, heartless, crime.
