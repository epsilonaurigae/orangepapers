<p>
Hey Orange,

<p>
I'm going over your Propaganda and Debating Techniques again, finding examples of
the use of these techniques by Obama and other liberals that mirror the use of them
by Bush etc. whom you prefer to use as examples.  I am cutting them up and sending
&quot;a technique a day&quot; to my kids in college via e-mail, as I believe these will be
invaluable lessons that they can use for the rest of their lives to sort through the
bull not only in education, politics and the media, but in everyday conversations.
But by reading of both conservative and liberal use of propaganda, they will see
that this is a universal phenomenon, not just a trait of the conservatives whom you
present pretty exclusively in your examples.  By this I mean the examples presented
of current or recent politicians; we can all agree that Hitler and Stalin were
bad...although if they or their systems had ultimately won out, we might be singing
their praises!  If we were around at all.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi David,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, alas, Democrats use those propaganda
 techniques too. I wasn't trying
to only use Republican examples  &#8212;  it's just that the Bush administration
 was in power for all eight of the
years that I was putting that list of techniques together, so they provided
the most egregious examples of logical fallacies and other uses of those
deceptive techniques.

</font>
<p>
I note your definition of:

<p>
<blockquote>

&quot;Hobson's Choice&quot; or Alternative Advance<br>
Provide two or more choices which do not cover the range of possibilities, but which
only reflect essentially the same proposition.<br>
A Jehovah's Witness recruiter may say,
&quot;If you don't agree with me, let's study this book I've brought along. If you do
agree, let's go to the Kingdom Hall this Sunday.&quot;<br>
Both choices expose you to indoctrination in their religion. One obvious logical
choice is missing:
&quot;If we don't agree about religion, we can just drop the matter and part company
amicably.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>
Wikipedia (agreeing with other sources) says:

<p>
<blockquote>

A Hobson's choice is a free choice in which only one option is offered, and one may
refuse to take that option. The choice is therefore between taking the option or
not; &quot;take it or leave it.&quot;.... Hobson's choice is different from:
<ul>
<li> a.. a choice between limited options....
<li> b.. False dilemma &#8212; only two choices are considered, when in fact there are others
<li> c.. Catch-22 and Morton's Fork &#8212;  all choices yield equivalent, often undesirable,
results
</ul>
</blockquote>
I don't know about &quot;Alternative Advance,&quot; but aren't you off track with your
definition of &quot;Hobson's Choice&quot;?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I believe that you are right. Thanks for catching that.
 I'll have to fix that.  I always found that definition
of Hobson's Choice awkward, and now I think I know why.
</font>
<p>
Again, thanks for an incredible website.  Like so many others, I was losing my life
to the AA cult, but your writings, along with the observations of my extremely sharp
and sceptical wife of the past 10 years, pretty much deprogrammed me and saved me
from that life.  I am now convinced that part of the reason why I relapsed in the
past is because I was &#8212; and still am &#8212; coerced to attend AA and to use the 12 steps to
stay sober.  No other alternatives have been allowed.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the compliments, and I'm glad to hear that you benefitted from the pages.
</font>
<p>
The &quot;program&quot; does things to a person's mind, but producing sobriety is not one of
them.  After 13 years of being an AA true-believer and repeat lapser, I have now
been 12-step and alcohol free for over 2 1/2 years.  It has been remarkably easy
since I stopped doing constant inventories and beating myself up all of the time.
Your web pages gave me other techniques, the most important being...don't take the
first drink.  I have the power not to do that, and I use it.  It's a Hobson's
Choice, and I choose not to drink.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations. That's really good.
</font>
<p>
But Step One is just Fraud One in AA.  The size of your website speaks to the
massive amount of lies and fraud in AA and the related cults, and in the massive
&quot;recovery&quot; industry.

<p>
I am still forced to attend meetings, but your website is an effective antidote to
AA's murderous brainwashing techniques.  I completely disagree with your politics,
but when it comes to recovery you have hit the nail on the head, so you are one of
my heroes anyway.

<p>
Have a great life, Agent Orange.

Subject:  	hello<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I am an educated 51 year old female, who was sober back in 1995 for 7 years without
AA. I started drinking socially again in around  2003 and quit again 7 months ago. I
can honestly say that although I don't drink anymore, it was only because my body
was having a hard time getting the alcohol out of my system even only having 2
drinks.  The funny thing is that I never needed anymore than 2 drinks.  I would also
go weeks without a drink. I never &quot;progressed&quot; as AA members say into somebody
&quot;doomed to surely die......if they pick up again&quot;

<p>
I did attend AA in a new city in March of this year. But prior, I think I could have
quit without AA again. This is what I found at AA:

<p>
They don't reach out to help you as a newcommer. Not one lady reached out to me
first. I had to approach them.  I actually heard one woman announce in a discussion
meeting, that she wasn't approaching newcommers anymore, that they &quot;had to do the
work on their own&quot;.....what?

<p>
I made phone calls to many of them.  But got tired of doing all the work because
they never called me to see how I was doing?  I was the one making all the calls.

<p>
There was one guy there who everybody seemed to look up to.  This &quot;phony&quot; told me
once leaving the meeting how &quot;good I looked, and I was a fine looking woman&quot;.  I was
so embarrassed, humilated and vulnerable. This was a man who they looked up to in
the area? What?

<p>
I asked one woman to be my sponsor and she turned me down! (her husband talked to me
a lot, and I think she was afraid to loose her man). That's what the 12 steps teach
you! LOL!

<p>
When I stopped going, I didn't get 1 phone call from about 12 women I met at AA,
even wondering where I was? I was working on just a few months of sobriety!  The
fact is, they are phony friends and they really don't care.

<p>
I kept leaving meetings feeling like a pile of crap.  Guilty and ashamed. I just
couldn't stand listening to their stupid little system of working those steps, or
telling strangers your business, or making it like your sponsor is a God or
something.

<p>
I go to an occasional meeting.  But I let them know, they will never, ever see me as
a regular again. I can stay sober without them. They look at me funny like I am an
alien because I don't &quot;keep coming back&quot;.  I tend to go for the socialization once
in a blue moon, and usually what I see is a place where it is easier to not come as
often. I may make it once every few months, if that. But that is my choice.

<p>
They just don't get it, their program doesn't keep you sober. If you get sober in
AA, you were ready to get sober. It's called &quot;just being ready&quot;. If you make a few
friends there, and want to keep socializing there, that's your business.  I am
personally involved in different social functions who don't preach to me about
alcoholism. I don't like being reminded constantly about how sick I am because I am
NOT SICK.  I make choices not to drink. I am healthy, normal, and well.

<p>
So keep up the good work reminding people that there are &quot;many&quot; ways to get sober!!!

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
A

<p>
Oh, Orange.  Please make sure you don't post my name and email address!

If 12-Step programs had ANY integrity, they would have told the courts, and other
entities (county drug and alcohol offices, probation, and parole offices!) to STOP
sending people to them a long time ago! But they don't! They need the bodies. It
gives the &quot;true believers&quot; someone to lord over! It makes their piss-ant, pathetic
philosophy somehow justified to be perpetuated on those who have no use or desire
for it (like listening to a Mormon missionary or a JW for example!).

<p>
But there is hope: 2 years ago, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a
Hawaii case (Inouye vs. Kemna) that ANY &quot;coercing authority&quot; can be held
INDIVIDUALLY, CIVILLY LIABLE for the 1st Amendment constitutional rights violation
that they perpetuate on people unwillingly and involuntarily FORCED to go to 12-Step
programs! Why? Because of their overwhelming religiosity! 12-Step groups claim
they are &quot;spiritual&quot; (yet 6 of the 12 steps mention or imply &quot;God&quot;
&#8212; not exactly
screaming atheism!). So let YOUR &quot;coercive authority&quot; know that he/she/it is SUBJECT
TO A LAWSUIT! BY YOU! IN FEDERAL COURT! See if that won't change their tune!

<p>
And for the 12-Step groups that thrive on coerced attendees: if you can't get people
to attend your circle-jerking VOLUNTARILY, why DO you exist, anyway?

<p>
Hi &quot;Orange&quot;,

<p>
I find myself morbidly fascinated by the time and effort you have put into your
vitriolic expose of Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous; I come back to your web
site every few weeks to read more. It seems that Bill was one of the most vile and
evil individuals in the history of mankind and most of the fellowship are just
twisted, domineering, ego-maniacs. It is amazing how many desperate simpletons have
given themselves over to this ridiculously idiotic &quot;program&quot;.

<p>
I do have one question for you. After repeatedly denouncing the idea of
&quot;powerlessness&quot; you then include this &quot;jewel&quot; in your &quot;Lizard Brain Addiction
Monster&quot; chapter:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It was easy to quit. So I can mess around a little, and have a few now and then, and
it will be okay. Even if I do get readdicted, I can just easily quit again.4)<br>
(Warning: no you can't. Each relapse drains energy out of you, and quitting the
second time is several times harder than the first.)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I am wondering this: If &quot;each relapse drains energy out of you&quot; thus making the next
attempt several times harder, then if I keep relapsing will I not eventually run out
of &quot;energy&quot;; thus making quitting impossible?  On the other hand, if there is not an
endless supply of &quot;energy&quot; but maybe it is replenished, then the notion that it will
be &quot;several times harder&quot; next time around doesn't make much sense. Can you help me
out on this, it sounds like I can become &quot;powerless&quot;?

<p>
Curious,

<p>
&quot;The Loon&quot;<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Loon,
<p>
Thanks for the question.  And the answer is, &quot;No, not powerless. Even if it is
extremely difficult to quit a bad habit, that is not 'powerlessness'.&quot;

<p>
Something else that is going on there is the fact that the motivation to quit again
builds back up, albeit slowly.

<p>
When I would backslide and return to smoking cigarettes, it usually took about
three years before the pain and suffering built up to the point where I could muster
up the will power to quit again.  I never quit again after, say, smoking for one month.
It took a few years for the motivation to build up.

<p>
I only relapsed on alcohol once, but when I went out, I stayed out for nine years.
I was not powerless over alcohol for those nine years; I just didn't want to quit.
I didn't want the fun to end.
It took a lot of pain and suffering for the motivation to build up again.
<p>
Still, quitting the second time was much harder than the first, and it took more
suffering and bad things to get me to quit again.
Now mind you, it was not the actually quitting and physical withdrawal that
was hard, it was getting the will to quit.
<p>
For example, the first time around, I was
horrified when I had blackouts and couldn't remember what I had done the previous
night. That was part of the motivation to quit.
<p>
The second time around, blackouts were normal, and I shrugged them off.
I could hardly ever remember what I did the night before.  But since nobody had
arrested me, I couldn't have done anything too bad, I guessed.
Blackouts were no longer horrifying enough to get me to quit.
And the same goes for a lot of the other bad effects of excessive drinking.
Things had to get a lot worse before I quit again.

<p>
So yes, it can get harder and harder to quit again &#8212; it takes worse and
worse things to get the motivation to quit &#8212; the horrifying is no
longer horrifying enough &#8212; but that still does not mean
the someone is &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
It just means that it is harder to get up the determination to quit again.
<p>
Now I see how you can envision a degenerating sequence of quitting and relapsing
until quitting is so difficult that it is beyond the ability of an alcoholic.
But it seems like it isn't really the quitting that is beyond the abilities of
the alcoholics &#8212; rather, what they lack most is the will.
They can't <i>want to quit</i> enough to really do it.
They lack the motivation. They just don't really want to quit
and give up the fun (no matter how much
they might say that they want to quit).
There are a lot of such people, and I'm sure that they make up
a sizeable fraction of the 100,000 alcoholics in the USA who die from
alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction each year.
<p>
 And A.A. does not save them either.
<p>
If anything would help them or save them, it would have to be a program or therapy
that increases will power and motivation to quit drinking,
 rather than telling them that they are
powerless over alcohol, and that they must surrender their will to a
 &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
(Not coincidentally, one of the four objectives of SMART just happens
 to be to increase motivation to quit bad habits.)
<p>
Have a good day.

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160730212458/http://DrugWatch.com/" target="newwin18">DrugWatch.com</a>.
 While I was browsing through a number of addiction and
substance abuse sites I came across your website and was very impressed by
the information you have listed.

<p>
Our site features a comprehensive list of drugs and medications that are
currently on the market, or were previously available worldwide. We are
dedicated to educating the public about the details of prescription and
over-the-counter medications, as well as aiding in the protection of
patients and consumers by informing them of any associated side effects.  We
also feature updated information concerning drug recalls, medication
approvals, and current developments in the medical field. Patients who are
taking medication for their conditions should know the facts when it comes
to the benefits and risks of such drugs as well as their addictive
potentials.

<p>
I noticed that you already had some other addiction and substance abuse
resources listed at orange-papers.info/orange-links.html and figured you
might be interested in including a link to our site as well.
...
 With your help we can keep the
public informed about important drug information. Thanks again!

<p>
Sincerely,<br>

Hi Jeff,
<p>
Okay, I'll give you a plug. I haven't had the time yet to explore your
web site yet, but I like the sound of what you are doing.
<p>
While most people think about things like heroin, cocaine, speed, and ecstacy
when you talk about &quot;drugs&quot;, the truth is that prescription drug abuse kills more
people (including Elvis and Michael Jackson).
  So it's good for somebody to be keeping an eye on the whole lot of them.

<p>
Good luck with your work, and have a good day.

Hi Tim,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry, but you are dead wrong.
Condemnation of wrong-doing and evil is very necessary.
 The only thing needed for evil to rule
this world is for the good men to remain silent and do nothing.
<p>
Why don't you ask Jesus about his condemnation of the
 cheating money-changers, and whipping
them from the Temple? Are you going to tell Jesus that,
 &quot;Condemnation of others is no solution&quot;?

<p>
By the way, claiming that you shouldn't criticize or condemn anybody is
a standard dodge that cults use to avoid getting criticized.
It's also a standard way to

<p>
12 Ways to have fun at a coercely-attended NA/AA meeting

<p>
Date: 2009-10-18,  1:39PM

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1.) Bring along some rock-salt (or a little tar, or powdered sugar!) wrapped in
cellophane. Leave it in a conspicuous place, like next to the coffee pot! (Listen for a
scream from the bathroom shortly!)
<li>
2.) Steal the coffee pot! Hold it hostage until your card is signed. (Trust me, its
more important than you are, or anyone else who is there!)
<li>
3.) When asked to announce yourself, say, &quot;My name is Agent ______, I work for the DEA, and
I sure see some familiar faces here!&quot;
<li>
4.) Volunteer to read the steps, then do it really, REALLY FAST (like you are yakked
on coke, or meth! ;). Offer to read the entire book &#8212; right then and there &#8212; in 30
seconds! ;)
<li>
5.) Ask if the connections are inside, outside, and if they have any &quot;12-Step deals&quot;
going on!
<li>
6.) When the time comes for &quot;announcements&quot;, announce that since its impossible for
coercing authorities to truly verify whether a &quot;court-card attendee&quot; attended, that
everyone can just sign their own card, and then leave. And the secretary is hereby
fired.
<li>
7.) Inform the &quot;old timers&quot; that they no longer meet criteria to remain in the group
as they no longer have a &quot;desire&quot; to BECOME clean/sober if they are already
clean/sober (one is a thought &#8212; the other an ACTION!)
<li>
8.) Ask how many Big Books it takes for a good bonfire (I am guessing, 12?)
<li>
9.) Ask about the orgies that are rumored to occur at &quot;conventions&quot;!
<li>
10.) Bring a notepad and camera-phone. Explain its for &quot;research&quot; purposes, and
&quot;findings&quot; will be posted on YouTube shortly!
<li>
11.) Volunteer to do the closing prayer. Pretend to nod off during it. Several
times. Become irate if someone offers to finish it for you. Maintain death grips on
the people you are holding hands with!
<li>
12.) Ask which of the 12-Steps actually apply to any individuals, since none of them
have personal pronouns like &quot;I&quot;, or &quot;me&quot; or &quot;you&quot; in them!
</ul>

<p>

Hi would like more info on ur perspective on why 12 dont work. And on you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello 201640,

<p>
The second question is the easier one.
<a href="orange-letters136.html#who_r_u" target="newwin88">Here is the list</a>
 of answers to &quot;who are you&quot;.
<p>
Then, why the 12 Steps don't work? Well, that's quite a list. Let me at least hit
a few of the strongest points.

<ol>


<p><li> Teaching people that they are powerless over alcohol is self-defeating. What we need
are people who have more power over temptation, not less.
And a good recovery program will do everything it can to build up people's power
and self-control and self-reliance.


<p><li> Teaching people that they are insane, and only a &quot;Higher Power&quot; can restore them
to sanity, makes them worse, not better.


<p><li> Teaching people that they drink because they have &quot;defects of character&quot;, and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, is just plain old wrong, and it is also self-defeating.

<p><li> Getting people wallowing in guilt and confessions is very counter-productive,
and tends to make people drink more, not less.

<p><li> The whole slant of the 12 Steps is negative. There is not one step that
says that you are a good person, or competent, or strong, or that you can get
a grip and get sober and take care of yourself. It's all about how wrong and
how bad you are.

<p><li> The 12 Steps are just crazy cult religion that
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin20">
 Bill Wilson copied from
Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot; cult</a>. Those Steps don't have anything
 to do with alcohol abuse. Buchman's practices were designed to recruit and
indoctrinate new members of his cult, not to cure alcoholism.

<p><li> Somebody imagining that he can get special instructions and power from God in
an 11th-Step s&eacute;ance is pure superstition. And it can make people do crazy
things when they do whatever the voices in their heads tell them to do.
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#absurd_ideas" target="newwin21">Even Bill Wilson said so</a>.


<p><li> The insane belief that the 12 Steps can substitute for medications has
gotten a bunch of people killed. That is faith healing of the worst sort.
And loads more people relapsed when they stopped their medications.
And
<a href="orange-letters147.html#medications" target="newwin22">many more suffered
 unnecessarily for years</a>.


<p><li> Steppism is a culture of sickness, not a culture of health.

</ol>

<p>
Well, I guess that's enough reasons for starters.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Thank You.<br>

<p>
Hi there,

<p>
I just wanted to take a moment to thank you both for your bodies of work, and for
having the character and dedication to speak from intellect and reason, when it
seems (at least to me) that there is an ocean of other voices who would prefer you
remain silent.

<p>
I'm a 44 year old former AA member.  10 years of my life &quot;in the rooms,&quot; 5 of them
heavily involved.

<p>
In the year 2000 I had a true &quot;moment of clarity&quot; and realized, suddenly and
profoundly, exactly how much of my mind I'd given away to a pseudo-religion in which
I hadn't even believed in the first place.

<p>
It's not an exaggeration when I tell you that I've read every page of &quot;Diseasing of
America&quot; and &quot;The Orange Papers&quot; dozens of times.  I believe these works will stand
the test of time as major contributions to the field of addiction studies.

<p>
I remember hiding &quot;Diseasing of America&quot; when I first got it.  That's how fearful
I'd become, how small my mind had gotten.  I wasn't even going to meetings anymore.
But I believed that just owning the book was an affront to AA and what had &quot;so
freely been given&quot; to me.

<p>
When I first visited orange-papers.info, I cleared my browser history so nobody would
know I was reading dangerous information.

<p>
This is not the behavior of a person who is &quot;happy, joyous and free.&quot;

<p>
It wouldn't be fair for me to blame AA entirely &#8212; I was vulnerable and
lonely and willing to block out logic in exchange
for approval and a place to belong.

<p>
I'm glad to say that since leaving AA, I have taken back my mind.  I have reclaimed
my right to enjoy the sweet freedom of critical thought.  Complexity.  Nuance.
Depth.  And most importantly, I have reclaimed my right to ask questions.

<p>
The excellence of your efforts has renewed my hope many times over the years, and I
thought it was important to let you know that your work has helped me.  Really
helped me.

<p>
So...thanks for that!

<p>
I would prefer to remain anonymous, should you ever wish to post or forward this
letter.

<p>
Best,

<p>
anonymous

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are free,
and that you benefitted from my pages.
That makes it worth the effort.
<p>
Pardon me, please don't take this the wrong way, but I actually got a laugh out
of your saying that you erased the browser history so that no one would know
that you were reading dangerous information.
The funny thing is, way back in the beginning, when
<a href="orange-letters25.html#motivation4creating" target="newwin31">I sent my
 first essays to Apple</a>
(who had the AAdeprogramming.com web site then), and explained my situation, she

Yes, dangerous writings.

Have a good day.

Subject:  	The Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I recently stumbled upon your Internet posting &quot;The Orange Papers&quot; and have found it
just fascinating.  I am myself an active member of AA and have recently enjoyed an
extended period of sobriety (admittedly, I had several relapses over several years
and it did take me some time to get my life together).  I also have to admit that I
have not finished reading your web page, but I definitely will.  I guess I just
wanted to reach out and tell you that my experience in AA has been quite different
from what you have described.  I live in New York City, and many of the members of
my group have more than 20 years of sobriety.  Sure, there are people who come and
go (and yes, many of them do not return), but what I have learned is that those who
really &quot;get&quot; what the 12 step program is about are people who live  lives of honor
and service &#8212; and that has helped them to stay sober.

<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
I want you to know that I am not offended by your paper, although my opinion is that
I think it could have the unfortunate result of dissuading people who could
potentially benefit from what AA has to offer from looking into it...but that is
obviously your objective.  Regardless, my experience has been that people who's
lives get bad enough (if they survive) usually make their way to AA after trying may
other treatments that have not worked anyway...so it's all good.  As my father used
to say, the truth speaks for itself and needs no help.

<p>
Whatever your ax is to grind is yours...and it is your God given right as an
American to express it openly.  But if i can ever be of any help to you in
clarifying what i believe is a misunderstanding of what 12 step programs are about,
i would be happy to speak with you.

<p>
Good luck and I wish you all good things.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>

Hello Nicholas,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You actually managed to say that telling the truth
about Alcoholics Anonymous harms alcoholics in a much nicer way
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin42">than most Stepper do</a>.
<p>
But a whole lot of other people disagree with you, and say that it's the 12-Step cult
that is harmful.
<p>
The fact that you have some members in your group who have 20 years of sobriety
does not indicate that A.A. works. That argument is an example of the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#semiattached" target="newwin07">The Semi-Attached
 Figure</a>&quot; propaganda technique. The statement that &quot;many of the members of my group have more than 20 years of sobriety&quot; is meaningless without the context, which is,
&quot;So how big is the group, and how many newcomers are there each year?&quot;
  The real question is, &quot;What percentage of the newcomers
get 20 years of sobriety?&quot;
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins"> The best numbers that I have</a>
 indicate that only
one in a thousand gets 20 years. That number is so low that there is no reason
to believe that A.A. keeps people sober.
 A few people keep themselves sober. Those are the people that you describe as
the &quot;people who really 'get' what the 12 step program is about&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject: help with NA book<br>


<p>
 Mr. Orange;

<p>
 I have happilly found my way to your site. And after much review I thought
 to go thru my N/A book and mark out all the false delimas, and implanted
 phobias, and contridictions..... but then I thought how nice it would be
 if someone else has already done that.

<p>
 Google offered no N/A  book critique. So I was wondering if you might have
 a colleuge  or knowledge of a web site who has treated that book with the
 same carefulness that you have with the Big Book.

<p>
 One thing I have so far figured out form reading parts of it is that the
 entire system is meant to implant power to the lizard brain. The readings
 say be here or else addiction lurks.  It makes me bonkers.

<p>
 Here we have, on the one hand, people who leave their Christianity and
 manage to eliminate the fears of hell. And weaken entirely the self doubt
 urges. And I think to myself, why can't one distance and educate themselves
 and likewise weaken and eliminate the addiction drive?

<p>
 Wouldn't it be weird if ex-christians joined groups that told them to keep
 coming back or else you will get saved again?

<p>
 I don't feel that my letter is worthy of printing (as I offensivly mixed
 metaphors by mentioning christianity), I just wanted to ask you personally
 if you had information I could use concerning the N/A book.

<p>

<p>
  (ps. of course writing a Chrisitanity Anonymous joke might be
 hilarious for you to undertake and I'd want to see it.)

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi Michael,

<p>
Thanks for the letter.

<p>
Alas, I haven't gone through the N.A. books to the same depth as I have
done with A.A. books. I own a few of them, and have paged through them and
compared sections with their A.A. brethren, to see how N.A. wrote
the same things, and quickly came to the conclusion, &quot;Yes, it's a clone.&quot;
But I don't really have any great information to add, and I don't know
anyone who does.  Maybe the readers do?

<p>
Don't worry about mixed metaphors. And I loved the line about
ex-Christians joining support groups that say, &quot;Keep coming back or you
might get Saved again.&quot; That's good.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hello Anne,
<p>
Thanks for the quote. That's good. And it seems totally appropriate for
people whose religion consists of praying for miracles on demand.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	thanks for your work<br>

<p>
After 13 years in AA I am no longer identifying as an alcoholic or going to
as many meetings. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
drinking. I am going to one meeting a week and telling people that ask what
I did not what I think.

<p>
I bought the programming when I was new and stayed sober in cult like
fashion taking no responsibility for myself.

<p>
Today I stay sober knowing that...

<p>
<ol>
<li>
I am not an alcoholic.

<p>
<li>
I am not powerless over alcohol.

<p>
<li>
I am not bodily and mentally different from my fellows.

<p>
<li>
I have done stupid things but am not insane.

<p>
<li>
I do not have to completely give myself to this simple program.

<p>
<li>
AA is a recovery venue where it is completely inappropriate to date.

<p>
<li>
AA is sexually charged and it is inappropriate for men to sponsor women.

<p>
<li>
Platitudes, euphemisms, jargon, rhymes, sayings, slogans, rhetoric,
absolutes, old timer gurus, and group think, are all things of cults.

<p>
<li>
Sponsorship is dangerous. I do not know a single sponsor who has not taken
on the role of life coach.
</ol>

<p>
I have learned much about human nature by going to meetings. Human
instinct, breeding, networking, opportunism, control, etc. In Alanon I
acquired tools that can be used as weapons or defense against would-be
steppers.

<p>
As with all things, I now use AA in moderation. I do not drink because I
appreciate my health today and do not want to trade a couple hours of
intoxication for any clouded judgment or illness.

<p>
This is my 12th step.

<p>

Hi HPP,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and have
a good take on things.
<p>
So have a good day and a good life.

Subject:  	Thank you for your webpage on Bill Wilson and AA &gt; Lost a friend to this cult.<br>

<p>
Dear A. Orange:

<p>
Just want to seriously thank you for the writing on Bill Wilson and AA.  I
have been writing a paper on alcoholism and scientific research that is
geared towards a solution based on science through breaking down the DNA
strand.

<p>
I recently lost two friends in August 2009.  One to severe alcoholism (he
had major family history of the disease) he had been to meetings and rehabs
all over the continent &#8212; didn't help.   I lost my second friend to AA.  He
traded one addiction for another which started out with one meeting once a
week or every other week &#8212; has progressed into two a day and broke up with
me.  All he talks about is AA, addiction, disease &#8212; depressing to watch this
and I don't know him anymore.  His sponsor's word and his &quot;program&quot; come
first.   Now that my other friend died &#8212; he uses that as an even stronger
reason people should be in AA.

<p>
Your information is a great breakdown of some facts I have found in
different places.

<p>
Respectfully, M.L.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michelle,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.
 I'm sorry to hear about your losses. Both
addictions and cults are just monsters, aren't they?
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	thankyou so very much<br>

<p>
dear mr orange
<p>
 i would just like to thank you for helping me escape from AA. i've been
sober just over seven years and i've realised that its me thats kept me sober or
rather my choice to keep away from alcohol.
<p>
i was always seen as a rebel within AA because i dared to question its tenets and
the big book.
<p>
i read the big book over and over and still though it was the biggest load of
(excuse my french) old shite ever printed.
<p>
 your site is superb and very well researched and intelligent.
<p>
have you ever watched a film called zeitgeist? its very interesting it exposes
religion as the fraud of the ages.
<p>
AA is just another cult that caught on much the same as the moonies etc and i'm sure
as mankind's understanding of addiction increases it will die a slow death
<p>
Once again thankyou from my heart agent orange i think i may become agent green igf
thats ok lol.
<p>
as they say here in england mr orange i like the cut of your jib.
<p>
many thanks<br>
 roy.

<font color="blue">
Hello Roy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. I haven't seen &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. I'll have
to check it out.

<p>
It's quite alright with me if you use the name &quot;Agent Green&quot;, but I must warn you
that at least two other people are already using the name, and
<a href="orange-letters90.html#agent_green" target="newwin76">one is very pro-A.A.</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-letters64.html#agent_green" target="newwin77">
 one is anti-A.A.</a>.
Also see
<a href="orange-letters112.html#agent_green" target="newwin79">
 this discussion</a>
 of the pro-A.A. Green,
and
<a href="orange-letters122.html#agent_green" target="newwin80">

<p>
Have a good day.
