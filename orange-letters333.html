BLOG NOTE: 2012.11.26:
<p>
This borders on the unbelievable: I might have trouble believing it if it didn't
come from a fairly reputable news source &#8212; the
NBC Evening News.
They reported that back in the 'fifties or 'sixties, the U.S. military was proposing
<b>Project A119</b>, which was a plan to use nuclear weapons to
blow up the Moon, to impress the Russians. No joke. For real.
They were that insane.
Fortunately, a young Carl Sagan advised them against it.
<p>
Think about that the next time a President says that he listens to the military generals
when they tell him what to do.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
P.S.: It turns out that this is well-known to some people. Wikipedia already has a web page on it:<br>

BLOG NOTE: 2012.11.27:
<p>
Investigators just discovered that the Kabulbank in Afghanistan,
run by President Karzai's brother, is totally corrupt
and has been stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. Even the auditors
who certified the bank's financial reports were corrupt and in on it, and just
rubber-stamped the bank's false financial statements.
<p>
The Kabulbank got huge deposits of foreign aid money from the USA, and then transfered
the money to other countries, under false names and fictitious corporations, and
the money is gone. Investigators have little hope of tracking down and recovering
the money. (NPR Morning News on 2012.11.28 reported that Kabulbank smuggled out cash
in airline food trays.)

<p>
And this is just a few days after more news came out about the Fed bailing out
UBS &#8212; the United Bank of Switzerland. Why is the U.S. Fed bailing out a Swiss bank?
Why doesn't the Swiss government bail out UBS?

<p>
Do we notice a pattern here? Why is it that the U.S. Government is forever giving
hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to corrupt and failing banks? No matter
whether it's the Wall Street banks, or Afghanistani banks, they are corrupt
and dishonest and cheating, and the money vanishes down a black hole with nothing
accomplished. And nobody ever goes to Leavenworth for it.
<p>
And the bribe-taking Congressmen refuse to pass laws to regulate the banks properly.
<p>
Now why is that?  Isn't that getting to be a little suspicious?
<p>
And American young men are dying to prop up that corrupt Afghanistani regime?

</font>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
P.S.: A few days later, UBS was in the news again. This time the Justice Department fined
UBS many millions of dollars
for fraud and laundering dirty drug money. Isn't it kind of strange that the U.S. Government first
pays UBS's fine in advance, and bails them out big time, to keep them in business,
and then fines them for their crimes and takes back a small part of the gift?  Very strange.

Hi All
<p>
The debate about whether addictions are literally diseases, or only metaphorically
so, is old. I teamed up with Nigel Turner, who wrote a dissertation on metaphor. In
this article, we focus on problem gambling but also on addictions in general. I
believe this to be the first effort to address that old debate with a solid
grounding in the role of metaphor in all conceptualization, including scientific.
This article actually touches on points we make in a book now in press.
I thought this article might interest some of you.

Hi again, Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the article. That's good.
<p>
About all that I can add is, &quot;Of course drinking and gambling are not diseases.
They are behavior.&quot;
If someone drinks too much or gambles too much because they have an underlying mental
illness, then the mental illness is the disease, not the gambling or drinking.
<p>
Have a good day, and a happy holiday season now.

Sorry about the cold. Those are never fun. I imagine they suck even more
when you're older. At least colds go away after a couple of weeks. Can't
say the same about tobacco nastiness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Yes, this one dragged out longer than usual. Everybody around here got it, and
everybody complained about the fact that it would seem to go away, then it would
turn around and come back and clobber you again. I'm not sure if that is a cold
or a flu. Whatever. At least it's mostly gone now.
<p>
And it still isn't as bad as smoking.

I did get some hilarious wank from conservatives after Obama's election. It
was like Christmas morning after weeks of awful Christmas songs. My
favorite has to be the Facebook friend who went on about how America got
killed by 9/11 and Obama voters, aka &quot;self-serving citizenry&quot;. I'll admit I
mostly keep this guy in my friends list for entertainment. That, and he's
actually a pretty cool guy off the internet. But give him an internet
connection, and off he goes linking to infowars.

<p>
Speaking of nuts, here's some conservative lady going on a drunken rant
about the election:<br>

Of course, all this shit gets scarier when you consider these people vote.

I used the touchpad on my dad's laptop recently. I had to use both hands
with that thing. One for the buttons, and the other for the touchpad
itself. Sure, I could do that &quot;double-tap to click&quot; thing, but the damn
thing doesn't recognize those gestures most of the time. At least, not when
I want it to. It works fine if I accidentally brush it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I get that too. The touchpad is forever mispositioning the cursor because a thumb brushes
it while I'm typing. Linux used to have a command to turn the touchpad off, but I
haven't found it in this version yet.
</font>
<p>
And apparently Logitech sells wireless touchpads, so you can replicate that
experience with your desktop. Maybe Logitech makes better touchpads, but I
still can't imagine why anybody would willingly use one.

<p>
Dr. Oz used to be on Oprah Winfrey's show, too. She sure does have a talent
for finding quacks.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, part of Oprah's popularity was that she sold a feel-good optimism where you could
achieve great things, often by just wishing and thinking positive.  That is a natural
set-up for a con artist to exploit.
</font>
<p>
That horror stories list is getting disturbingly long. I wonder how long until you hit 100.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't know, but I'm sure that we will get there.
<p>
I just moved that list
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">to its own file</a>,
where it can expand indefinitely.
</font>
<p>
And what happened to Gus' other children?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alas, I think they got eaten. My best guess is the ermine (who looks just like a
weasel). He has been killing a lot of ducks and geese. He has eliminated all of
the white ducks, and the mostly-white ducks, and the gray-and-white ducks, including
<a href="orange-letters271.html#goslings2" target="_blank">the ducks that were cute
little yellow ducklings last year</a>,
and the gray-and-white duck that was sitting on a nest this year. All gone.
<p>
I really feel tempted to get rid
of that ermine, but predators have their place in the ecosystem too.
The problem is, this ermine doesn't just kill the old and the weak and the sick, he
is an opportunist who kills everything and anything that he can get his teeth into.

<p>
I doubt that it was an eagle or a hawk, because either of them would have a
very hard time grabbing three goslings at once. But an ermine could jump on the goose's nest
at night, and grab one gosling in its mouth, biting down and killing it, while
holding down two others, one under each paw. Then it bites and kills them, and it's
got three for dinner.

<p>
That's my guess. It's extremely unlikely that the goslings just got lost, or left behind.
The parents are very good at watching over their goslings and not leaving them behind.
And if the kids think they are lost or left behind, they have a loud,
piercing &quot;locator call&quot; that is a high-pitched shriek that
says, &quot;Help Mommy! I'm lost, and I can't find you!&quot;
The mother answers with a honk that
says, &quot;I'm over here,&quot; and the youngsters come running to her.
<p>
So it isn't likely that they just got lost or left behind.
No, I think it's that ermine.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and a happy holiday season.

The first time I saw goslings kissing was when I had the first family of orphaned goslings.
One day, as I was walking them in the North Park Blocks, two of them wandered off to the left on their
own, exploring and munching the grass over there,
while the others stayed with me as we walked back to the food and water bowls. Then the
two wanderers rejoined us a few minutes later.
The others joyously greeted the wanderers with a rapid chatter, and then kissed them. How they
did it was to chatter rapidly, and then lightly bite the lower beak of the other one. Then
they reversed it, and the other lightly bit the lower beak of the first one.
<p>
I watched this, and said, &quot;Good grief, you guys! You have only been separated for two minutes,
and you are greeting each other like long-long brothers.&quot;
I guess two minutes is a long time to goslings.

really bad.  I never felt so bad about myself as when I was forced to attend.

<p>
Your research helped me see how bad they really are.  I wrote letters and protested
and was finally allowed to not have to attend.  But I did come close to losing my
job.

<p>
I am very angry and bitter I was forced to go through that.  I really want to grab
someone by the collar and ask why they would do that to anyone &#8212; but I can't.  I'll
never really get over it, but I know I'll survive.

<p>
Thanks again.

Hello Tony,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
I'm sorry to hear about what you had to go through, but glad that you are out of it now.
<p>
It isn't all over. You don't have to just accept such treatment.
There is much that you can do.
<p>
First off, I'd contact the local ACLU and talk about suing for
damages for coerced cult religion. Many high-ranking judges have already ruled
that A.A. is a religion. And the Federal Appeals Court in Hawaii,
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, September 7, 2007, in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222303/http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/229810/AA_Can_Not_Be_Forced_Onto_Parolees" target="_blank">the Inouye v. Kemna case</a>,
ruled that any &quot;coercing authority&quot; can be held individually,
civilly liable for the 1st Amendment constitutional rights violation that
they perpetrate on people unwillingly and involuntarily forced to go to
12-Step programs. Meaning: <b>you can sue a judge, a prison warden, a parole officer,
a &quot;counselor&quot;, or anyone else in a position of authority who
forces you to go to A.A. meetings</b>.
<p>
If getting fired is a concern, think about the fact that you could end up owning
your boss's company. In addition, if he fires you for seeking justice, that is another
lawsuit for wrongful termination.

<p>
It is possible that you can also sue your ex-wife for damages caused by her snitching.
It wasn't her place to act as an informant. That is defamation of character and
breach of confidentiality.

<p>
You might find that your local state representatives and senators
are particularly sensitive to such issues, much more so than national
Senators and Congresspersons. You can contact them and talk about coerced cult
religion as &quot;treatment&quot; of drug and alcohol problems. What I'm seeing is that
money is tight, and our representatives are getting tired of
expensive state-sponsored treatment programs
with zero-percent rates of improvement (over no treatment at all).
<p>
In addition, you can publicize the story, and write letters and articles talking
about how coerced cult religion is the default way to handle all drug and alcohol problems.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day. And have a happy holiday season.

hi orange, captain britain here. just wanted to say that all politicians
are bought and paid for by the massive corporations. its the same here
in britain. we are constantly told to work harder and stop bitching
while our leaders have 16 weeks holiday a year. the number of food
banks has quadrupled in the last two years whilst the parasitic royal
family have had their taxpayer funded wages incresed 10 per cent year
on year. the biggest evils in my country are the banks, religion, and
the so called elite. but as we are now seeing throughout europe the
first stirrings of a true revolution. As the late great bill hicks
said, just imagine if just for one year we spent all the money we spend
on war on feeding and clothing the worlds poor. not one person left
behind and then we could explore space together in peace forever! he
was a true american and e gentleman. keep doing what you are doing
orange bless you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Royski,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I can only agree. I especially liked the line
about what if we spent the military budget on helping the poor. Even our previous
President Eisenhower (the former General Eisenhower)
spoke about how every jet airplane represented the
theft of schools and hospitals from the people. The USA spends more on
the military than the rest of the world combined. Add up what Russia and China
and Europe all spend on their militaries, and the USA spends more.
That is insane.
<p>
There is such a thing as self-defense, and then there is paranoid madness.
There is no sane reason for the USA to have enough nuclear weapons to blow up
the entire world. (Back in the 'sixties it was 19 world overkills. That is,
19 times as many nukes as were required to kill everybody on Earth.)
What a waste of money. No wonder the USA is going broke. 
<p>
About the number of food banks increasing rapidly: Yes, that is happening in
the USA too. I cannot predict the future exactly, but I expect that life is going
to be tough for a lot of people. (Actually, it already is for places like Africa.)
<p>
The increasing scarcity of oil has reduced the standard of living
around the planet. At the moment, we have oil companies bragging about all of
the wonderful new gas and oil deposits that they have found, and how we shall
soon be oil-independent. Baloney. All that you have to do is look at the price
of oil to know the truth. From 1990 to 2000, the price of oil was around $10 to $14
a barrel. Now it's bobbing in the range of $80 to $120 a barrel. That's all
that you need to know. It's the law of supply and demand at work.
The price of oil will drop only when there is sufficient supply to fill everybody's
needs. We don't have any such supply,
so the price of everything from gasoline to food to heating fuel is going up.
And like some giant leech, that is sucking the lifeblood out of the economy.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

<p>
I, too was the only person that &quot;graduated&quot; sober in my entire' treatment center'
class.  I also was the only one that did not read the big book or work the steps or
have a sponsor.  I have also closely observed that it's very, very seldom one will
see a young person become sober under the age of 30.  The perplexing issue is the
100,000 + alcoholics that die from this malady each year..  Are they simply so
&quot;alcoholic&quot; or so mentally flawed that they have lost the &quot;choice' to make a
decision concerning their deadly habit.  I think they have gone past the point of no
return where no organization or group can work with them.  I am not sure if the high
suicide rate is because of the AA program.  I believe the group of the 100,000 dead
alcoholics annually only hope is when the medical field starts treating, in the
future, these sick individuals with specific medications.  I trust that someday the
medical profession will find a medical cure for this riddle, and that Alcoholics
Anonymous will continue, purposely, to slow down the medical progress.  What a mess.
What a sad mess.
<p>
Happy Holidays to you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Tom,
<p>
I have to agree. I think that much of what gets labeled as &quot;alcoholism&quot; is really
mental illness like depression or bipolar disorder. In fact,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#depression1" target="_blank">Bill Wilson himself
was a chronic depressive</a>, somebody who spent many years disabled by chronic clinical
depression.
<p>
Then there are people who are in a lot of pain &#8212; physical or mental &#8212; and they are
just trying to kill their pain.
<p>
Then, to make matters worse, chronic use of alcohol is also very depressing, so the
people who use alcohol to try to self-medicate just double their troubles.

<p>
Yes, we need much better medications for a variety of disorders. And of course A.A.
will resist the use of medications, because proper medical treatment will render
A.A. useless and unnecessary.
<p>
Have a good day, and a happy holiday season.

Did you see this story?

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222303/http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/11/28/addiction-counselor-charged-with-murder-dui-after-driving-miles-with-man-lodged/" target="_blank">

<p>
Another &quot;winner&quot; of a drug &amp; alcohol counselor. Although the article does not say
specifically that this woman &quot;counselor&quot; pushed the 12-step program on her clients,
I would bet dollars to donuts she did.

<p>
One thing in the story that struck me was many people from the decedents friends and
family went to court to show their support. Nowhere does it say anyone showed up in
court to support the accused woman. My question is, where happened to all that
unconditional love and support from the recovery community? So much for that, huh?

<p>
Bill

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the reference. Yes, that story is really something else, isn't it?
What a counselor. Just the kind of person who should get paid with our tax dollars
and health insurance money to teach other people how to live, right? (<i>Not!</i>)

<p>
I also see that she didn't just relapse once or twice &#8212; she was a chronic
relapser, and yet she was still a &quot;counselor&quot;.

<p>
That story reminds me of my own
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Christina" target="_blank">cocaine-snorting child-raping &quot;counselor&quot;</a>, another jewel of a counselor who wasn't qualified to teach anybody anything.

<p>
One of the big problems with drug and alcohol treatment as it currently exists is
that most of the so-called counselors are former addicts or alcoholics who learned
that they could make a living by yammering
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#slogan_list" target="_blank">the Stepper slogans</a>
that were just yammered at them.
They benefit from Bill Wilson's crazy idea that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#uniquely" target="_blank">a former addict or alcoholic
is somehow better equipped to teach other people how to live</a>
&#8212; better than a doctor or a sane person.
And those ex-convicts and ex-addicts work cheap, which is convenient for the
&quot;treatment center's&quot; profit margins.

<p>
And yes, those counselors are mostly Steppers, because most of the treatment
centers that trained them use 12-Step treatment. It's all that they know.
<p>
About the brethren counselors and fellow A.A. members not showing up and giving her some
moral support and &quot;fellowship&quot; and &quot;unconditional love&quot;,
that doesn't surprise me. When my counselor was busted, the other
staff people regarded him with bitter contempt and disgust
because he had embarrassed them and made
them look bad. Guys like him reveal that the whole TC organization is all a fraud
with completely unqualified staff people who teach nothing. &#8212;Nothing that works, that is.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now. And a happy holiday season.

Subject:  	possible factors in becoming an alcoholic<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I am an alcoholic and I have written to you before.

<p>
I am now sober for 16 months.

<p>
I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask you.

<p>
I once heard this bloke in AA, who had a lot of sober years, say words
to the effect that he believed that for many alcoholics drinking
alcohol, especially in the early years, caused a certain very intense
powerful euphoria which is much greater (and sort of different too)
than the milder sort of buzz and pleasure that most non-alcoholics get
from drinking. And this was an important factor in why many alcoholics
became alcoholics.

<p>
Do you think there is any truth to that?

<p>
Also, I have heard more than one AA member say that what a lot of
alcoholics have in common was that they were people, even before they
started drinking, that had a lot of irrational and neurotic but deeps
fears. And this was a big factor in causing alcoholic drinking.

<p>
Again, do you think there is any truth in that?

<p>
Paul.

<p>
PS Again, many thanks for the Orange Papers.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the thanks. And congratulations on your sobriety.
That's good. You are over the hump.

<p>
About your first question: Yes, I think that alcoholics enjoy alcohol more.
But please watch out there, because that statement is completely unsubstantiated
and unscientific. I can only base my guess on personal experience.
&quot;Normal&quot; people have a few drinks and say, &quot;That's enough.&quot;
Alcoholics say, &quot;Hey, I'm just getting started. I'm on my way to Heaven.&quot;
&quot;Normal&quot; people just don't care about alcohol that much.
They get sick on alcohol once or twice, and they don't drink to excess much after that.
Alcoholics won't stop trying to drink themselves into Paradise.

<p>
I suspect that the second question gives part of the reason why.
<p>
The second question, about pre-existing fears, insanity, and other factors: Oh yes, definitely yes.
And that is well-substantiated, and medically and scientifically valid.

<p>
<ul>
<p><li> Child abuse is one of the biggest causes of alcoholism and drug addiction.
Doctors have discovered that a part of the brain called the Cerebellar Vermis does
not grow properly when the child is chronically abused, and chronically afraid.
A shriveled-up Cerebellar Vermis causes a person to feel out of sorts and never quite right,
and unable to feel joy like &quot;normal&quot; people,
so they turn to drugs and alcohol to try to fix things.
See <a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">the study of the Cerebellar Vermis</a> for more on that.


<p><li>
Forty percent of all alcoholics and junkies were abused children.
Sometimes the parents were alcoholics, sometimes dopers,
sometimes just insane. Sometimes insane vicious religious nuts, or insane
cruel alcoholic military sergeant fathers.
Sometimes insane first, and then they used alcohol or dope to
kill the pain of their insanity.
Often, those abusive parents had been abused children themselves,
and they were just passing it on. For whatever reason, they then abused
their children, physically, or mentally, or both, and the
children responded by using alcohol or dope to kill their own
pain.
<ul>
<p><li> And, in addition, at least half of the people in prison for
violent crimes were also abused children.
Perhaps it's much worse than that &#8212; according to one survey,
85% of all violent prison inmates were abused in childhood.
<p><li> Two-thirds of all teenage mothers were raped or sexually
abused as children or teenagers.
<p><li> Rape victims are ten times more likely than other women
to use drugs and alcohol to excess.
<p><li> In the U.S., at least one in ten women have been raped,
almost two-thirds before the age of eighteen.
<p><li> A recent survey reports that one-sixth of all rape victims
reported to police are under the age of 12. (And this is the
category of rape least likely to be reported.)
One-fifth of these girls were raped by their fathers.
They have been betrayed.
</ul>

<p><li>
And then there are the people who suffer from various forms of mental illness,
who use drugs and alcohol in a vain attempt to self-medicate and try to fix
what's broken.
Even Bill Wilson, the founder of A.A., falls into this category:
Bill Wilson was a raving lunatic who suffered from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">delusions of grandeur</a>
and a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic personality disorder</a> and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#depression1" target="_blank">chronic clinical depression</a>,
which neither alcohol nor the 12-Step religion ever fixed.  And
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">his psychiatrist, Dr. Harry Tiebout, told him so</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="#9F0000">
P.S.: 23 December 2012: &nbsp; <i>60 Minutes</i> just came up with another one: <i>Asperger's Syndrome</i>.
&quot;Aspies&quot; also often try to fix their condition with drugs and alcohol.

Keep up the good work, questioning what you think is rubbish.  It is
interesting to hear and consider different points of view, though I
disagree with much of yours.  But congratulations on 12 years and the
ability to maintain the web site.  I look forward to continuing to explore
and contemplate.  Thanks! (I think) ;-)

Just out of curiosity what don't have against AA? Have you ever attended a
meeting?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kirill,
<p>
What I have against A.A. is that it does not work, and they lie about that to sick people
and their families and friends. I'd be all for A.A. if it actually worked as they say.

Thank you for the links. I have started to read them. Very interesting so
far. You seem very well spoken and educated. I am currently about 9 months
in and regularly attending AA meetings. I previously had 2 years and
relapsed. I'm on a journey of discovery and I will definitely look up all
the references you posted.
<p>
Thanks again.<br>
Wish you a happy holiday season :)

Okay, Kirill,
<p>
Thanks for the response. That sounds good. Good luck now, and have a Merry Christmas.

<p>
Just wanted to say thank you for this amazingly well-referenced site.
<p>
I just went through the heartbreak of having to break up with my boyfriend
because I kept getting the feeling more and more that AA seemed like a cult.
I thought I would always be second to his obsession. Then I started to
doubt myself and thought maybe it was just my perception, and decided to
google it and see if anyone else on the internet suspected the same thing.
Wow, I couldn't believe it.
<p>
 I had no prior bias or exposure to AA and yet
myself and so many others came to the same conclusion, and then I found
your site backed up with references and rationale. I'm not the crazy one
after all &#8212; I'm not the one who gave up their relationship blindly for a
cult. He can enjoy his 3 hours a week smoking cigarettes with other
degenerates while I finish my Ph.D and then go live life, out in the world.
<p>
Life is not meant to be lived in a smoky basement. I will not be the
neglected wife and I'm sure as hell not going to Al-Alon meetings. Screw AA
for manipulating weak people. It's wrong.
<p>
Thank you.

<p>

Hello Misty,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for the thanks. I'm glad to hear that you have
your head screwed on straight. Sorry about the troubles that you have had to go through,

a good life.

And have a good day now.

<p>
hi,
<p>
Finding your site a couple of years ago was a great experience, as it was the first
I'd seen anyone speak out against &quot;the cult&quot;...  after having a negative experience
regarding a forum (not yours), I went back to your site to see where you stand on
this particular subject &#8212;  and it seems you take the same 'old-skool' approach as I
do...  So if you don't mind me asking, has anyone ever given you any flak about
writing the abbreviation of &quot;that program&quot; as A.A. , and saying it must be written
AA instead?  An individual told me they would not use my article on their site
unless they could change A.A. to AA throughout the entire article &#8212; so I'm no longer
a member of their site, because I felt it was unreasonable and &quot;controlling.&quot;
thanks if you have time to express a viewpoint on this!
<p>
C.S.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello C.S.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.  And thanks for an interesting question.
This is the first time I heard of some nit-picker quibbling so insistently
over whether Alcoholics Anonymous
should be abbreviated with or without the periods. When I first  began writing essays about A.A.,
I was wondering about that myself, so I looked in various A.A. books, and found that they
did it both ways themselves. But the <i>Big Book</i> did the abbreviation with periods, so
that is the standard that I adopted.

<p>
I just grabbed the first copy of the <i>Big Book</i> that I found handy, and it is a third
edition. I opened it to page 510, and there it says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;That was my attitude towards A.A. at the time.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
I found nine more &quot;A.A.&quot;s on that page and the following page, all with periods.
<p>
Likewise, page 221 says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;In summing up, I can say that A.A. has made me, I hope, a real Catholic.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
And again, at the start of the book, page &quot;v&quot; says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>Pioneers of A.A.</b><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Then, I picked up the tiny dark blue pocket-sized paperback edition
of just the first 164 pages, plus <i>Dr. Bob's Nightmare</i> &#8212; Fourth Edition &#8212;
and on the fifth page (unnumbered, should be numbered &quot;v&quot;), the Table of Contents
lists all A.A. references with periods, like,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li> The A.A. Tradition
<li> The Medical View on A.A.
<li> The Religious View on A.A.
<li> How to Get in Contact with A.A.
</ul>
</font>
</blockquote>
And again, page 163 says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We know of an A.A. member who was living in a large community.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Then I found a 2nd edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, and checked it,
 and that thing also uses A.A. with periods throughout, too.
<p>
So the A.A. headquarters is writing the A.A. abbreviation with periods. And they are copying
how Bill Wilson wrote it.

<p>
On the other hand, I know I've seen other literature that abbreviates it as &quot;AA&quot;.
Now what those guys are doing is mimicking the style of government acronymns, like CCC, WPA,
FBI, CIA, OMB, DOD, etc., which do not have periods in them.

<p>
For example, Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's secretary,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Hartigan1" target="_blank">wrote about Bill's philandering with
the words</a>,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Besides what he was doing to the women he was chasing and to Lois, his behavior was a huge source
of controversy in AA,&quot; Tom said.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W., A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous
Co-Founder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan, 2000, pages 171-172.</font>
</blockquote>
And
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#WynnC" target="_blank">
&quot;Mathew J. Raphael&quot; (a pseudonymn), another biographer, wrote</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It seems that Wynn C. [Corum], See's father's second wife (he was her
fifth husband), had once &quot;come within a hair-breadth
of becoming the First Lady of AA.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W. and Mr. Wilson; The Legend and Life
of A.A.'s Cofounder</i>, Mathew J. Raphael, pages 130, 195.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Still, for that web site to refuse to publish what you wrote because you used periods is
pretty uptight and anally retentive. They can't stand someone writing &quot;A.A.&quot; the way that
it is printed in the <i>Big Book</i>?
<p>
Well, that's a cult religion for you.  Insanely nitpicking and quibbling.
They are nuts.
<p>
Way back, just after World War Two, Eric Hoffer wrote about &quot;true believers&quot;
in &quot;mass religious movements&quot;, like
popular cults, paying particular attention to the phenomenon of the Nazi Party, which was
fresh in everyone's mind. He said:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When some part of a doctrine is relatively simple,
there is a tendency among the faithful to complicate it
and obscure it. Simple words are made pregnant with
meaning and made to look like symbols in a secret message.
There is thus an illiterate air about the most literate
true believer. He seems to use words as if he were
ignorant of their true meaning. Hence, too, his taste for
quibbling, hairsplitting, and scholastic tortuousness.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
== &quot;The True Believer, Thoughts on the Nature of Mass

Yep, quibbling and hairsplitting.  He got that right.
