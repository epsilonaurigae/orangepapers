Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be
the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than
under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may
sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those
who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do
so with the approval of their own conscience.
<p>
Their very kindness stings with intolerable insult...
<p>
To be 'cured' against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as
disease is to be put on a level with those who have not yet reached the
age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and
domestic animals. But to be punished, however severely, because we have deserved it, because we
'ought to have known better', is to be treated as a human person made in God's image...
<p>
And when they are wicked the Humanitarian theory of punishment will put
in their hands a finer instrument of tyranny than wickedness ever had before...
<p>
The new Nero will approach us with the silky manners of a doctor, and
though all will be in fact as compulsory as the tunica molesta or Smithfield
or Tyburn, all will go on within the unemotional therapeutic sphere where
words like 'right' and 'wrong' or 'freedom' and 'slavery' are never heard...
<p>
Even if the treatment is painful, even if it is life-long, even if it
is fatal, that will be only a regrettable accident; the
intention was purely therapeutic...
<p>
But because they are 'treatment, not punishment, they can be criticized
only by fellow-experts and on technical grounds, never by men as men and
on grounds of justice...
<p>
But we ought long ago to have learned our lesson. We should be too old
now to be deceived by those humane pretensions which have served to usher
in every cruelty of the revolutionary period in which we live.
These are the 'precious balms' which will 'break our heads'.<br>

PHOENIX &#8212; The director of a boot camp for troubled youngsters was
arrested on murder and child-abuse charges Friday in the death of a
teen-age camper who collapsed in 111-degree heat last summer.

</font></td></tr>
</table>
Charles Long II, 56, was also charged with aggravated assault for
allegedly pulling a knife on a camper, and marijuana possession, for
a quarter-pound of the drug found in his bedroom closet. 
<p>

The second-degree murder charge was filed over the death of 14-year-old
Anthony Haynes. He died July 1 while attending a five-week boot camp
operated by the America's Buffalo Soldiers Re-enactors Association.
<p>

The medical examiner's office said Haynes died of complications from
dehydration and near-drowning &#8212; dehydration after being made to
stand in the sun for up to five hours, the near-drowning from being
left in a motel bathtub, where he had been taken to cool him off. 
<p>

Two other boot camp staffers also were arrested Friday. Camp sergeant
Ray Anderson, 39, was charged with child abuse for allegedly spanking,
stomping, beating and whipping more than 14 children. He was also
accused of denying them water or shade in the heat. 
<br>
...<br>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Times,Roman,Sanserif"><i>
[The detail not mentioned in this article is that the other
staffer, whose name the Sheriff did not release,
was actually a 17-year-old boy. He was an assistant staffer,
recruited from among the &quot;old-comer&quot; prisoners.
He was the one who was in direct command of Anthony
Haynes when he died. He was the slave-driver who
forced Anthony to stand in the sun until he died.
The camp sure trained those kids well, didn't it?]
</i></font>
<br>
...<br>
The camp began operating in 2001 and was closed down by the sheriff's
office July 2 after Haynes' death. Investigators said the camp's
regimen included forced marches, black uniforms in triple-digit
temperatures, harsh discipline and a daily diet limited to an apple,
a carrot and a bowl of beans.

<p>
What the article doesn't say is that Anthony Haynes' death was
actually worse than described &#8212; he was slowly tortured to death
over a period of several days.
Only when he was obviously dying did the
staff take him to a motel and try to cool him off.
And then, as if that weren't enough,
when the bathtub full of cold water that he nearly drowned in didn't
revive Anthony Haynes, Charles Long declared that Anthony was faking
it and ordered that he be brought back to the camp, not taken to
a hospital...

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
FYI: All of those temperatures that they tell you,
like &quot;111-degree heat&quot;,
are measured <i>in the shade</i>.
When you are hiking in the blazing desert summer sun,
the temperature is <i>much</i> hotter.<br>
And standing in the
sun in a <i>black</i> uniform for hours is crazy, simply insane.
That will cook you to death.<br>
And then denying the kid drinking water guarantees death.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Earlier, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio had called what happened
at Long's camp &quot;organized torture towards children.&quot;
<p>

Some children in the summer program now say they were punched,
kicked and forced to eat dirt for minor infractions such as failing
to stand up straight. Campers say they had bruised ribs from an
exercise in which they were ordered to lie on their backs while
counselors ran across their chests in boots.
<p>
&quot;We were thrashed around, kicked, punched,&quot; said
David Mandraes, 17, of Peoria, even though &quot;nobody had done
anything wrong.&quot; In addition to closed-fist punches, he and
other camp participants were &quot;elbowed, kneed, anything you can
think of, they did it,&quot; he said.
<p>
	    
One 13-year-old girl camper
says females faced additional harassment, and that counselors (who
liked to be addressed as &quot;sergeant&quot;) called her
&quot;whore&quot; and &quot;prostitute.&quot;
&quot;They asked me how much I charged,&quot; she said.

<p>
One participant in the camp near Buckeye, Justin Boe,  16, of Phoenix,
said drill instructors sometimes forced campers to lie on their
backs &quot;in the cockroach position,&quot; with their arms and
legs in the air at 90-degree angles.

Boe said the instructors would then stomp the campers' chests and
pour mud on them, forcing them to swallow it.

&quot;Every time I closed my mouth, he (one instructor) told me,
'Open it!'&quot; Boe said. &quot;He would start stomping harder.
Even if I spit out dirt, he told me to swallow. After, I was
coughing up rocks for about four hours.&quot;
<p>

Sheriff Arpaio called the allegations &quot;horrific&quot; and shut
down the camp. He also launched parallel investigations, one into
the death of Tony Haynes, which he described as &quot;suspicious,&quot;
and the other into allegations of abuse at the camp.

&quot;Why would you take somebody who may be sick to a hotel and
then bring that person back?&quot; Arpaio asked. &quot;These are
questions we have to find out.&quot;
<p>
Bill Lanford, who led paramedics to the camp
in a futile attempt to save the life of Anthony Haynes,
said that many of the children were crying when they arrived.
He said: &quot;It was very disturbing. We were working and the
counselors were more interested in disciplining the kids.&quot;
<p>

In an editorial, July 7, 2001, <b>The Arizona Republic</b> newspaper
commented:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You need not endure the horrific stories of kids being forced to eat dirt,
of kids being beaten, kicked and shackled to each other through the night, to
recognize that a bizarre madness reigned at the American Buffalo Soldier camp
near Buckeye.
<p>
You wouldn't even have had to know that 14-year-old Tony Haynes died
at the camp last Sunday, thrashing in agony in 112-degree heat,
likely of dehydration and exposure.
<p>
Rather, the fact of the camp's very existence is evidence enough of
unrestrained lunacy. Why were 45 kids ages 7 to 17 even out there in the
blistering Arizona heat, scarcely supervised and with virtually no
refuge from the elements and little nourishment?
<p>
The answer simply is that there was no oversight of this &quot;tough
love&quot; abomination. There was no one to tell &quot;Colonel&quot;
Chuck Long, the camp's operator, that he wasn't exercising
&quot;tough love.&quot; He was exercising sadistic brutality.

<p>
Tony Haynes was definitely a troubled youth. His mother said that he
took medication for depression, hyperactivity and anger. He had a
history of acting out and being troublesome.
Still, I can't help but wonder: Just what kind of a crime does a
child have to commit to deserve to be made to eat dirt and then
deprived of drinking water in the blazing desert summer sun until
he drops dead?

<p>
Well, for Anthony Haynes, it was: He slashed the tires on his
mother's car to keep from going back to the Buffalo Soldiers camp
again.
<p>

<b><i>Say what?</i></b>
<p>
Well, it turns out that Tony Haynes had already been going to
various Saturday programs and a
couple of three-day weekends at the Buffalo Soldiers
camp since March, 2001.
So Anthony Haynes had already tasted Charles Long's torture and abuse &#8212;
his &quot;tough love&quot; &#8212;
and he obviously hated it, because he fought to keep from going back
for more.
When he slashed his mom's tires in June to avoid going to a Saturday
camp, Charles Long suggested the five-week summer endurance program and
offered a sponsorship to pay his way.

<p>
&quot;He was going to take his punishment like a man,&quot; said
Tony's father, Gettis Haynes Jr., of Hannibal, Mo., who last spoke
to his son the night before he left for camp. &quot;I didn't think
dying was included in that.&quot;

<p>
Note the inadvertent admission that the camp was used for punishment,
not rehabilitation.
When parents send their kids to such prison camps,
they usually rationalize their actions
by saying that the camp is supposed to be &quot;character-building&quot;,
and &quot;improve the kids'
attitudes&quot;, and
&quot;give them a fresh start&quot;, or
&quot;give them a new lease on life&quot;.
Not in this case.
The boot camp was punishment that Tony was
supposed to &quot;take like a man.&quot;

<p>
Gettis Haynes said Monday that he &quot;wholeheartedly&quot; blames
the camp for his son's death. And he blames himself for sending him.
&quot;At the time, I thought I was doing the right thing. It was
probably the biggest mistake I ever made in my whole life,&quot;
Haynes said. &quot;These are children. These aren't soldiers.
They're not grown men. They don't have grown men stamina. They don't
have grown men strength.&quot;

<p>
Mr. Haynes was confused about the issues involved there.
It wasn't a matter of the victim being a man or a child.
What was done to Anthony Haynes was blatantly illegal abuse and torture,
and murder.
It would have been illegal, immoral, unethical, and unconstitutional even if it had
been done to an adult.
Heck, it's even a violation of the Geneva Convention rules for the
treatment of prisoners of war.

<p>
Not only was there no oversight, but nobody ever
checked out &quot;Colonel&quot; Chuck Long's background,
or asked about his qualifications to
be a child counselor or run a &quot;tough love&quot; child
rehabilitation camp.
<p>
It turns out that Charles Long had a history of criminal violence
and shady dealings:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Long II, the camp's operator, was
investigated in the
year 2000 over allegations of child abuse at a boot camp on the Fort
Apache Reservation in Whiteriver.
<p>
In July 2000, some youths in Long's program claimed they had been kicked,
choked and subjected to other cruelty by drill instructors. Fort Apache
officials imposed stricter standards and Long responded by moving
the camp off of the tribe's land.
<p>
Fort Apache's Tribal Council first ordered the boot camp closed while
federal officials launched a criminal investigation. That order was
rescinded after Long's backers rushed to the Buffalo Soldiers' defense.
Still, council spokeswoman Chadeen Palmer said Long pulled up stakes
because he could not accept conditions imposed by the tribe.
<p>

Ed Hall, a spokesman for the FBI, said the agency completed the
investigation and forwarded it to the U.S. Attorney's Office, which
declined to pursue the case. The Justice Department also declined
to pursue possible civil rights violations.

<p>

<p>
<li>
In 1989, according to Phoenix police, Long was arrested after using a
sledgehammer to break down the door of a residence occupied by his
ex-girlfriend.

<p>
<li>
In 1991, Long was arrested again for punching the woman during a dispute
over their 3-year-old son. According to court records, the woman told police
Long had previously abused her and their child. He was fined and put on
probation.

<p>
<li>
On 1992 resumes, Long claimed a political science degree from Wilberforce
University in Ohio. A university spokeswoman said Long never earned a degree.
Long also claimed to be a former director of the National Academy of
Broadcasting. A letter from the academy says there is no record of his
employment.

<p>
<li>

Long had originally founded
the Buffalo Soldiers Re-Enactors Association to provide troops for a
movie that he wanted to make, based on a screenplay titled
<i>Cry Vengeance</i>, about
Black cavalrymen who served as Indian fighters in the late 1800s.

Long failed to produce the movie <i>Cry Vengeance</i>,
leaving some investors crying foul.
<p>

Then, for a while, the Buffalo Soldiers Re-Enactors Association
focused on education,
appearing in parades and delivering school talks, and acting
as honor guards for visiting politicians in Arizona.

<p>
Then, Long added a new twist: programs for troubled kids. Long claimed that
it was Gen. Colin Powell who suggested that he go into the children's boot camp business.

Again, the Buffalo Soldiers' web site brags:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After coming to Arizona, ABSRA's Colonel &quot;Chuck&quot; Long was asked by
General Colin Powell to use America's Buffalo Soldiers' desire, dedication
and discipline existing in its adult program to additionally give something
back to the community by helping America's youth and adolescents with
difficult and often times, violent histories; to redirect their considerable
negative energy in a positive and productive manner &#8212; so was born and
added the present America's Buffalo Soldiers CAPSAG Youth Programs for
America's Promise.  Because of Long's attendance and experience at Hall
of Divine Child Military Academy (Monroe, Michigan), St. Thomas Military
Academy (St. Paul, Minnesota) and the United States Marine Corps,
ABSRA's Colonel Long believed that with a military style boot camp
discipline program, these troubled youths could be taught and redirected
to become positive members of society rather than lost souls, troubled
teenagers and some future baby face criminals of America.
<p> 
Colonel Long's philosophy, stemming from America's Buffalo Soldiers'
history of adversity, was to teach these youth Sacrifice, Honor, Respect,
Desire, Dedication and Discipline.  Starting with honor and respect for
themselves and a belief that if one respects himself or herself, he or
she will then deal with and treat others with that same respect.<br>

<p>
Harlan Robinson, a 74-year-old veteran of World War II, who once
served in the Buffalo Soldiers 9th and 10th cavalries, said most
of the unit quit years ago out of disgust over Long's financial
dealings and management style. &quot;He's got a lot of B.S.,&quot;
Robinson said. &quot;...He always needed money for this, that and
the other. ... To tell you the truth, I didn't like him very much.&quot;

<p>
<li>
On several occasions, creditors have accused Long of financial misconduct.

In 1993, Pamela Abbott and Darryl Khalid of Phoenix sued Long, alleging
that he failed to pay about $25,000 they invested in a failed attempt to
produce <i>Cry Vengeance</i>, and for a Wild West show.
Long denied owing the money
and filed a countersuit. The Superior Court case was dismissed.
But Abbott and Khalid won a partial judgment in small-claims court
and began investigating Long's background. They encountered a trail
of civil judgments and fraud claims, plus the dubious resume.
Abbott and Khalid asked the state Attorney General's Office to
investigate, but were informed that the case was not big enough.
<p>
&quot;To me, that man doesn't have any integrity,&quot; Khalid said.
&quot;You can't have a leader like that.&quot;

<p>
<li>
Charles Franklin Long II identifies himself as a &quot;Colonel&quot;
in the Buffalo Soldiers 10th Cavalry. He has claimed to be a Marine
Corps veteran of the Vietnam War, a former police officer, and a stunt
double.
<p>
Fact: Long may have given himself the rank of &quot;Colonel&quot;
for the purpose of kicking children, but <i>Newsweek</i>
magazine reported
in their July 16, 2001, issue that his real rank while he was in
the service was Lance Corporal.

</ul>

<p>
On Aug 24, 2001, Charles Long II announced that he was recruiting
new staff members
and preparing to launch another camp the following month.
Long maintained that the camps help to steer children in the
right direction.
<p>

&quot;We are coaches in helping young people get through life,&quot;
Long said. &quot;Trying to be the nice guy doesn't work with some.&quot;
<p>

Long said he has no regrets about incorporating &quot;tough love&quot;
boot camps into the Buffalo Soldiers Re-Enactors Association, an
organization that he says he founded to honor the contribution of
African-American soldiers who served in the Spanish-American War
and other military campaigns.
<p>

&quot;I never have, and I never will,&quot; Long said. &quot;No matter
what happens, my goal is to die doing this. When I started this, it
was about faith, not sight. It was in order to keep the history alive,
and pass it along to our youth.&quot;
<p>

Sheriff Joe Arpaio said there was nothing he could do to stop Long.
Well, actually, the Sheriff did find one thing: in February, 2002,
he arrested Long for child abuse and murder, and put him in jail,
where he still sits, in lieu of bail.

<p>
On February 21, 2002,
camp counselor Troy A. Hutty pled guilty to negligent homicide
in the death of Anthony Haynes in a plea arrangement that stipulates
that Hutty will receive probation.
Prosecutors explained the deal by saying that
they wanted to get the truth in the case.
It sounds like a deal for testimony against Charles Long II.
At least, that's what Long said.

<p>
On March 5, 2002, Charles Long II announced that he was really angry
about the unfairness of the situation.
(See <!--- a href="http://www.arizonarepublic.com/special36/" -->
<i>The Arizona Republic</i><!-- /a --> 03-05-2002.)
He had been arrested in front of his children, he complained. 
<p>
&quot;My wife has suffered severely,&quot; he said. &quot;Neighbors
don't look at me the same way. ... (Deputies) arrested me in front
of my 13-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter. My son will see that
the rest of his life.&quot;
<p>

Long didn't speak of the boy who died in his care, however, or of
the effect that it had on the Haynes family, or of what Anthony Haynes
saw for the rest of his short life.

The TV program <b><i>60 Minutes</i></b> did a short story on Charles Long and his &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; rehab after his conviction,

At least three dozen deaths have occurred in such &quot;wilderness
camps&quot; in the past decade.
Recent children's deaths in &quot;tough love&quot; boot camps
include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Michelle Sutton, 15, Summit Quest, Utah, 1990. Died of dehydration.
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Cathy and
Bob Sutton of Ripon, Calif., sent their 16-year-old daughter
Michelle to camp Summit Quest in the summer of 1990 because
she had become depressed and dabbled with drugs after she was
date-raped. The Suttons, who thought from a marketing director's
pitch that the camp sounded challenging but kind, paid $14,000 for
63 days. But Michelle's counselors got lost on an exercise in which
the campers had limited supplies of water. When Michelle ran out
of water, a counselor told the other hikers not to share, and joked
that Michelle's parched mouth was so white &quot;it looks like you've
been eating marshmallows.&quot; After complaining she couldn't see,
Michelle collapsed and died of dehydration.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Is This A Camp Or Jail?</i>, Adam Cohen,
<i>Time</i>, January 26, 1998 Vol. 151 No. 3.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Note that dehydration is one of the most easily prevented causes
of death in the desert. Just drink enough water, and you won't die.
Taking a troop of children out into the desert with insufficient
water is unforgivably stupid.
<p>
<font color="blue">
By the way, an adult needs <i>at least</i> 2 gallons of water per day
to survive the blazing desert heat.
That's not to be comfortable &#8212; that's 2 gallons just to prevent death.
The unbelievably dry air and the scorching sun just suck the water right
out of you.
Children need only a little less water because their small bodies
dehydrate faster.
No way will one canteen make it.
You need a whole backpack full of canteens and tankards.
In a jam, you can live for several days without food or any
other comforts, but you can't survive without the water.
Someone who organizes &quot;wilderness treks&quot;
for children in the desert should know such things.
<p>
The desert in the summer really is a life-threatening environment.
There are very good reasons why the pioneers named the Southwestern deserts
things like &quot;The Bad Lands&quot;, and &quot;Hell's Gate&quot;,
and &quot;Death Valley&quot;.
</font>

<p>
Gayle Palmer, the founder of Summit Quest, was not charged with any
crime for the death of Michelle Sutton.
<p>
Although she was subsequently denied a license by the Utah Department
of Human Services, Palmer brazenly resumed operations. In 1994,
near Zion National Park, a scruffy, frightened, 14-year-old girl
wandered into a remote archaeology camp begging for help. It
turned out that she was fleeing from a course Palmer had been
illegally running out of St. George, Utah, the same town where
Gayle Palmer had based Summit Quest.

<p>
<li>
On June 27, 1990, six weeks after the death of Michelle Sutton,
16-year-old Kristin Chase died
at the Challenger wilderness camp in Utah
of hyperthermia and dehydration
after a 5-mile forced march in 105-degree heat.
Once again, her counselors said that she was faking when she
complained.

<p>
The state of Utah charged Steve Cartisano and Lance Jaggar with
negligent homicide and nine counts of child abuse involving Chase
and other Challenger students.
Lance Jaggar cut a deal, and got off by agreeing to testify against
Cartisano.
Steve Cartisano beat the charges because the judge bungled the
trial and then the prosecutor succumbed to alcoholism, and the
state's case fell apart.
<p>
Remember that Cartisano name, you'll see it again.
Cartisano went on to set up more camps and abuse many more children.
<p>
And so did Lance Jaggar and the other Challenger employees.
They simply morphed Challenger, minus Cartisano, into a new company
called &quot;North Star Expeditions&quot;,
and went right on abusing children. Which leads to the next death.

<p>
<li>
Aaron Bacon, 16, North Star Expeditions, Utah, March 1994.
Beaten and tortured, thirsted and starved to death, as well as
denied medical treatment for a fatal condition.
The autopsy report stated that he died from a perforated ulcer,
but that is only the tip of the iceberg.
The sicker he became, the more he was tormented and tortured by
the staff.
He was constantly accused
of being a malingerer and faking it when he complained of being sick
and unable to go on.
When he begged to see
a doctor, the staff sneered at him and called him &quot;a faker&quot;
and asked him if he were &quot;homosexual.&quot;

<p>
<li> Dawnne Takeuchi, 18, was killed when she was thrown from a 
semi-truck near Pagosa Springs, Colorado, in June 1994.
Kimberly Stafford, the VisionQuest counselor who was driving the supply
vehicle, was convicted of careless driving and was ordered to pay $270
in restitution.

<p>
<li> Nicholaus Contreraz, 16, died at the Arizona Boys Ranch near Oracle,
Arizona, March 2, 1998, of cardiac arrest, after instructors
continued to harass him and force him to exercise even though he told
them he was sick.
Saying the his death was caused by &quot;cardiac arrest&quot;
is really sugar-coating the pill. He was tortured to death and
also denied medical treatment.
His death was particularly ugly.
(<a href="#Contreraz">See below</a>.)

<p>
<li> Gina Score, 14, at the state-run juvenile prison camp at
Plankinton, South Dakota, 1999. Run to death.<br>

That is, she was forced to run in the summer sun until she
collapsed, and then she was left laying in the hot sun until she died.<br>

The crime for which she was sentenced to death: petty theft.<br>

Two staff members were acquitted on child abuse charges in the death
and other problems, including making girls run in shackles until
their ankles bled.<br>

Finally, South Dakota abandoned the idea of boot camps for children,
and shut the facility down.

<p>
<li> Michael Wiltsie, 12, at Camp E-Kel-Etu, a private Florida facility,
2000.
The 65-pound boy was suffocated to death by a 320-pound
&quot;counselor&quot; who sat on him until he stopped breathing.
A grand jury refused to indict the camp counselor in Mikey's death.<br>

His death-sentence crimes: habitual misbehavior, vandalism and burglary.<br>

Mikey was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
and oppositional defiant disorder (meaning he was chronically disobedient).
When Mikey violated the curfew that was a condition of his probation,
a juvenile-court judge overruled mental-health specialists who
recommended intensive psychiatric treatment, and the 12-year-old ended
up being sentenced to a stay in a military-style wilderness boot camp.

<p>
<li> William &quot;Eddie&quot; Lee, 15, Obsidian Trails, Oregon,
Sept. 18, 2000.
<p>
<li> Anthony Haynes, 14, Arizona, July 1, 2001.
Died from physical abuse, heat stress, starvation, dehydration, and
near drowning.
Witnesses at the camp outside Buckeye, AZ, said he was forced to
stand in the sun for four hours while wearing a black uniform in 111 degree
temperatures (or 112, or 113, depending on which report you read),
was deprived of water, and made to eat dirt.
Haynes began hallucinating and at one point thought he saw a pond where he
could get some refreshing water.
The coroner found Anthony's mouth full of caked mud, and more mud in his
intestines.

Martin Lee Anderson<br>
1992 &#8212; 2006
</center>
</font></td></tr></table> 

Fourteen-year-old Martin Lee Anderson was murdered by sadistic &quot;drill sergeant&quot; guards
within 3 hours of his arrival at a Florida boot camp that
was run by the local sheriff, Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen, on January 6, 2006.
The local medical examiner, Dr. Charles Siebert,
tried to cover up the murder, calling it a death
from &quot;sickle cell anemia&quot;.
(Dr. Siebert is so incompetent that in 2004
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160812030741/http://nospank.net/n-p74r.htm" target="_blank">he autopsied a woman</a>,
and found that her testicles and prostate gland were &quot;unremarkable&quot;.
Women don't have those things &#8212; men do.)
But a second autopsy by a different examiner revealed that the child was
suffocated by the guards. They covered his mouth with a hand and forced
him to inhale ammonia, which caused &quot;spasm of his vocal cords&quot; and
prevented him from being able to inhale.

<p>
When mixed with water, like the fluids in your lungs and your blood, ammonia forms ammonium hydroxide &#8212;
household lye &#8212; which will eat your lungs out just as effectively as inhaling something
like chlorine gas, which forms hydrochloric acid when it mixes with the water in your lungs. As you can
imagine, your lungs will rebel and refuse to inhale any more of the stuff.
So you suffocate.<br>
<ul>
<li>
What kind of sadistic monsters did they have working at that &quot;boot camp&quot;?<br>
<li>
Who would even think of forcing children to inhale ammonia?<br>
<li>
What kind of a sicko would think that forcing children to inhale poison gas was
an appropriate way to manage children?
<li>
And who would hire such psychopaths as &quot;drill sergeants&quot; to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; children?
<li>
Shouldn't those murderers be in prison themselves, perhaps also getting kicked around by
some &quot;drill sergeants&quot;?

The Florida Governor, Jeb Bush, has long been a strong supporter of the
boot camp concept (for other people's children, but not for
<a href="#Noelle_Bush" target="_blank">his own crack-smoking daughter Noelle</a>).
Now Jeb says that big changes will be made. Jeb says that the boot camps
will be shut down, and will be replaced with new camps that will be run
by the same sheriffs as ran the previous camps.
The new camps will be called &quot;the STAR program&quot;, an acronym for
<i>Sheriff's Training And Respect</i>.

<a name="Aaron_Bacon"> </a>

16-year-old Aaron Bacon was another child who died a similar death at a
similar boot camp, North Star Expeditions, in Utah in 1996. When his mother saw his body
at the morgue, she said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I went into the room and his face was unrecognizable,&quot;
the Phoenix woman sobbed at a hearing in Utah last year. &quot;He
had these sunken cheeks, and his eyes, he looked like a skeleton,
his hands were all bone. I ripped the sheet off.<br>
...<br>
&quot;He was literally bruised, black and blue, from the tip of his
toes to the top of his head. He had sores between his legs, open
sores. The bottoms of his feet, I don't know how anyone could have
walked or hiked on them.
<p>
&quot;I began screaming, because something was terribly wrong.&quot;<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Tough love proves too tough</i>, Christopher Smith,
the Salt Lake Tribune, June 10, 1996.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="intervention"> </a>
Aaron's parents had paid $13,900 for a program that was supposed to
convince their son to quit smoking pot and experimenting with
LSD, speed and hallucinogenic mushrooms.
&quot;I knew it would be rigorous, but he loved the outdoors, and
I pictured him out there with God and nature, hiking all day,
discussing his issues with therapists around the campfire at
night.&quot; Sally Bacon says.  What gnaws at Sally Bacon is
that she never hugged her son good-bye when he was pulled from his
bed one March morning two years ago by two professional kidnappers
who called themselves an &quot;escort service&quot;
and hauled off to a southern Utah wilderness program for misbehaving teenagers.
(That was the procedure that North Star recommended.)

<p>

A month later, she got the chance. It came at a funeral home in Page, 
Arizona, where Aaron Bacon lay on a stainless steel table with a 
white sheet covering all but his face.
When she pulled the sheet from Aaron's body, Sally was confronted
with a battered, emaciated corpse.
She started screaming hysterically and
had to cover her eyes.
<p>
&quot;His legs were like toothpicks,&quot; Sally
recalls, breaking into sobs. &quot;His hipbones stuck way out,
his ribs &#8212; he looked like a concentration-camp victim. There were
bruises from the tip of his toes to the top of his head, open sores
up and down the inside of his thighs. The only way we were even
able to recognize him was a childhood scar above his right eye.&quot;

<p>
&quot;Right then it became obvious that Aaron's death was not an
accident,&quot; Bob Bacon says. &quot;We knew that something
horrible had been done to him.&quot;

<p>
Aaron Bacon, 16 years old, died March 31, 1994,
while on a North Star expedition in Utah that began March 1.

Aaron Bacon had been slowly tortured to death over a period of weeks.
He had been beaten and frozen, thirsted and starved, as well as
denied medical treatment for a fatal condition.

The sicker he became, the more he was tormented and tortured by
the staff.
He was constantly accused
of being a malingerer and faking it when he complained of being sick
and unable to go on.
Counselors and students taunted Bacon,
asking if he were &quot;homosexual.&quot;
After a month of such &quot;tough love&quot;, he died.
<p>

The coroner's autopsy report stated that Aaron died from a
perforated ulcer,
but that is only the tip of the iceberg.

<p>
When he was too sick to continue carrying his pack, and left it behind,
counselors forced him to go without food or a sleeping bag, both
of which were in the pack.
He went without food, a blanket, or a sleeping bag from March 22 to
March 25 on the 7,000-foot Kaiparowits Plateau, where nightly
temperatures dropped below 22 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the end, he was so sick that he lost control of his bodily
functions, and urinated
and defecated in his pants repeatedly, so the staff
made him hike without pants, and made fun of him.
He had started the program on March 1, but he didn't live to see
the end of that March.
He died at 2:54 PM, March 31, while the staff sneered at him and
called him &quot;a faker.&quot;
By 3:00 PM, the staff had changed their tune, and were screaming,
&quot;Oh shit! Oh shit!&quot;

<p>
The pathologist who did the autopsy reported that, due to
the perforated ulcer, the contents of
the boy's intestines had probably been leaking into his abdominal
cavity for 24 hours or more. &quot;He would have had low blood
pressure, a fever, an elevated pulse rate, and exquisite tenderness
of the abdomen,&quot; Grey says. &quot;Any reasonable person should
have realized that Aaron Bacon was in need of immediate medical
attention.&quot;

<p>
But not North Star Expeditions. They just said that he was
faking it.

<p>
The crime for which Aaron was sentenced to death:
Smoking pot and experimenting with LSD, speed, and magic mushrooms.
<p>
The North Star staff tried to rationalize away the whole incident by saying,
&quot;He was a hard-core doper, and his parents knew it.
His parents were dopers. Now they are just trying to blame it
all on us, and get us in trouble.&quot;

<p>
The local prosecutor was also interested in blaming it all on
them. The prosecution's evidence was stark:
<ul>
<li>
Aaron Bacon, a 5-foot-11-inch
teen, began the course weighing 131 pounds. When he died 30 days
later, he weighed 108 pounds.
<li>
Investigators from the Garfield County
Sheriff's Department and the Utah attorney general's office have
found that during the last 20 days of his life, Aaron went without
food for at least 11 days.
<li>
He also went without a sleeping bag for
14 nights when the average overnight temperature was 32 
degrees.
<li>
Aaron's worsening condition was chronicled in his journal as well as
the journals of other campers. He wrote about how his counselors
laughed at him for losing control of his bowel movements. Another
teen wrote that Aaron was starting to look &quot;like a Jewish person
in the concentration camps.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
&quot;The ignorance, arrogance, incompetence, callousness and greed
of the people running these programs is proving repeatedly to be
dangerous, abusive and even fatal,&quot; said Bob Bacon, Aaron's
father. &quot;The lessons are not being learned.&quot;


<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p><br></center>

Gina Score's crimes, for which she got the death sentence, were
stealing Beanie Babies from a store and stealing money from a school
locker &#8212; petty theft.

She was sentenced to the South Dakota state-run boot camp by the court.
Although her father David Score didn't have a choice, he thought
sending Gina away might be a good idea. Maybe the strict discipline
would get his daughter to stop stealing from other girls' lockers
at school.
<p>
Her father said that her thievery was always minor: Sometimes she
stole from her parents or her neighbors or from kids she knew.
She would take a few dollars here, a few there, mainly to buy candy.
Her dad says she never took more than $65 and she would repay most
of it. He couldn't figure out why she did it, because in every other
way, she was a normal, happy kid. Sensitive and intelligent, she
liked to write poetry and planned on skipping a grade when she came home.
<p>
Incidentally, fourteen-year-old Gina Score weighed 226 pounds.

<p>

<font color="blue">
Excuse me, is it just my opinion, or were a lot of people obtuse
as all getout? Why couldn't they see the obvious answer?
A 14-year-old girl who weighs 226 pounds and habitually steals petty
cash to buy candy so that she can shove even more calories into
her mouth obviously has a hellacious compulsive eating disorder.
That's why an otherwise intelligent and sensitive girl gets into
trouble like that. She needed medical and psychiatric treatment,
not prison camp.
<p>
Note the cultural bias there:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Fat girls are disgusting and should
be punished for eating too much.&quot;<br></font>

Skinny girls who suffer from
<i>anorexia nervosa</i> don't get sent to prison camps for some
well-deserved &quot;exercise&quot;, do they?
<p>
<hr>
<p>
One young reader, a veteran of the system, who shall remain nameless, wrote
in response to that:
<p>
</font>

<pre>
&gt; Also, once in your article you mentioned that a girl that had a
&gt; binge eating disorder should get psychiatric treatment. Sometimes,
&gt; that is just as bad. A lot of people think psychiatric hospitals
&gt; have changed, kids aren't beaten or abused there anymore, but they
&gt; are, and now even more kids are going there for the same
&gt; "quick-fix" reason boot camps exist. And also because parents are
&gt; using it as a type of manipulation, or they think their kid has
&gt; problems even if they don't, etc. It is the popular thing to do
&gt; today &#8212; to lock your kids up, or drug them.
</pre>
<p>
<font color="blue">

Yes. I didn't make it clear, but I was really thinking about some
kind of effective outpatient treatment that would just help her
to get a grip. Maybe I'm dreaming...

226-pound Gina collapsed from heat exhaustion during
a forced three-mile run in hot, humid weather. Her pleas for help
were ignored: As she hyperventilated, eyewitnesses later said,
counselors taunted her, accusing her (as happened with the others
who died) of faking her weakness. Gina struggled to stand, then
collapsed again and was left lying in the sun for three hours.
By the time she arrived at the hospital, her temperature registered
108 &#8212; as high as the thermometer would go. &quot;How,&quot; her father
David Score asked bitterly, &quot;could anyone treat another human
being that way?&quot;

<p>
Mark Soler, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Youth Law Center,
helped investigate the Plankinton, South Dakota, juvenile facility
after the death of Gina Score, and was stunned by what he saw:
a barbed-wire maximum-security detention center where some kids
were shackled and locked in isolation 23 hours a day for 30 days
in a row.
<p>	
&quot;There is not a lot of very serious juvenile crime in South Dakota,&quot;
says Soler. &quot;These kids were locked up for things like
truancy and curfew violations. Yet there was this extremely punitive
attitude which was not geared toward helping them.&quot;

<a name="Contreraz"> </a>

The death of Nicholaus Contreraz was also unbelievably gruesome. He was
tortured to death over a period of weeks. The sicker he became,
the more he was beaten and tormented, and accused of being a
malingerer and faking it, and denied food and water as
punishment. At the end of his life, he was also so sick that he was
unable to control his bodily functions:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
ORACLE, Ariz. &#8212;
On the day he died, Nicholaus Contreraz was awakened at 6:30 a.m.
He had been sleeping on a mattress positioned halfway in the bathroom of
Barracks 31. Staff at the Arizona Boys Ranch had placed the 16-year-old
Sacramento youth on Yellow Shirt status for, among other reasons,
persistently defecating and urinating on himself. They wanted him to be
near the toilet.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Employees at the paramilitary-style camp,
where hundreds of California
youth offenders are sent, had already tried to deal with Nick's
incontinence by making him sleep in soiled underwear, ordering him to
drop his pants so that other boys could inspect them, requiring he finish
whatever physical activity he was engaged in before using the restroom,
making him eat dinner while sitting on the toilet and, near the end of
his life, making him carry a yellow trash basket filled with his soiled
clothes and his own vomit.

the foul-smelling basket.
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the day before he died, Nick collapsed several
times during
physical training. After he fell while running up a hill, staff bundled
him into a wheelbarrow and made another boy push him around the camp.
Nick was told to make the sound of an ambulance siren.
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the day he died, a staff member told Nick
he deserved an Academy Award for faking.
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nick collapsed for the last time about 5:30 p.m.
on March 2. Staff members, who had spent the day ordering more and
more physical punishment, issued their last command. Get up, Nick
was told. &quot;No&quot; was the last word he spoke.
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nick was pronounced dead two hours later,
succumbing to a massive, undiagnosed infection that had conspired
with other illnesses raging in his body.

<font size="-1"><i>A Puzzling Death at Boys Ranch; California youth
died amid questions about his care at Arizona program for juvenile
offenders. Policy of sending kids out of state also scrutinized.</i>,
Julie Cart, <b>The Los Angeles Times</b>, June 14, 1998.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Arizona Department of Economic Security report stated
that 17 former Arizona Boys Ranch staff members were placed on
the Arizona Child
Abuser Directory as a result of their treatment of Nicholaus Contreraz.
Strangely, in Arizona, inspection, supervision and certification of
such children's boot camps is left to the &quot;Department of Economic
Security&quot;. Go figure. (It sounds to me like something out of
a bizarre dystopian science fiction movie, something like
&quot;Brazil&quot;.)

<p>
The California Department of Social Services report concluded that
Contreraz died as a result of &quot;medical neglect and physical
abuse&quot; and charged that there was a pattern of &quot;widespread
excessive use of physical restraint and hands-on confrontation&quot;
by staffers. The California agency harshly criticized the Arizona
Department of Economic Security for failing to inspect or
oversee the camp.

<p>
The Arizona Boys Ranch had a long history of documented complaints against
it. Arizona officials said nearly 100 child abuse complaints had been
filed against Boys Ranch or its employees in the previous five years.
Twenty-one of the abuse claims had been substantiated by state officials
during licensing proceedings and others were still under investigation.
But the Arizona State &quot;Department of Economic Security&quot;
still did nothing to stop the child abuse.
<p>
<font color="blue">
One has to wonder, &quot;Just whose 'Economic Security' was being
protected?&quot;
</font>

<p>
In July, 1998, the
California Department of Social Services advised all California counties
that it was ending funding for out-of-state placements at the facility.
Nearly three-fourths of the 400 juveniles at the ranch's seven campuses
had been from California.

<p>
Worst of all, Nicholaus Contreraz's murderers all walked. They
were charged with child abuse and manslaughter, but they got off on a
technicality.
The court ruled that the other staff were depending on the
(mostly absent)
staff nurse to inform them of Nick's medical condition,
and she had said that the kid was okay, so they were
not responsible for his death.
And then, by some twisted logic, the court ruled that the staff nurse
didn't have enough information to really know that the kid was going
to die (because she wasn't there enough), so she wasn't guilty, either.
So nobody was guilty.
<p>

The State of California canceled its contract for rehabilitation
of other children with the camp, but that was the extent of the legal
repercussions. Nobody did any hard time for Nick's death.
Such child-murderers rarely do.
<p>
<font color="blue">
The various state and federal governments just want
<i>somebody</i> to imprison and &quot;treat&quot; those
drug-using kids... And if accidents happen, oh well... What else
could you expect from such kids?

<font size="+1"><b>Gage Sentenced to 45 Years</b></font><br>

Eric Dolson, Nugget Newspaper &#8212; Sisters, Oregon.<br>
Feb. 2, 2001<br>

<p>
Steven Gage will probably spend the rest of his life in prison. 
<p>
Gage, 43, the former proprietor of Royal Haven Equestrian Center
for Girls near Sisters, was sentenced to 45
years behind bars on 27 counts of theft, criminal mistreatment
and sex abuse of teenage girls under his care.

<p>
The sentence was handed down by Judge Stephen Tiktin on January
31, 2001. It followed the guidelines of a
plea agreement between Gage and the Deschutes County District
Attorney reached January 4. 
<p>
Prior to sentencing, victim after victim of Gage's abuse, including
girls who ranged in age from 14 to 18 at the
time the sex abuse occurred, gave tearful testimony that he
should receive the maximum sentence allowed under the plea agreement.
<p>
&quot;He took the trust we gave him and twisted it for his own
sexual desire... I was just a child, and so was every
other girl he molested,&quot; said one young woman who accounted
for nearly half of the original 146 counts of sex
abuse that occurred.
<p>
While she spoke, Gage sat at the defense table, shrunken, having
lost dozens of pounds while sitting in jail
seven months waiting for his trial. His hair was thin and graying,
his face hollow and white. His head shook
slightly from side, either from a slight tremor or perhaps in
denial of the atrocities described. 
<p>
His head seemed to barely reach above the collar of an oversize
denim jacket with the words &quot;Deschutes County Jail&quot;
stenciled on the back. It made him seem even smaller.
<p>
&quot;Look at him! Do you think that this man would ever be a
part of any teenage girl's fantasies? It was
disgusting!&quot; said one of the victims of
coerced sexual activity with Gage. 
<p>
&quot;I don't know what shell of a human being does this to
13- or 15- or 17-year-old girls and thinks he can get
away with it,&quot; said another. &quot;He preyed on the souls
of children for his own sense of confidence.&quot;
<p>
Parents told the judge of the nearly unbearable guilt they felt
when they had discovered what Gage had done to their daughters. 
<p>
&quot;We were seeking desperately a safe harbor.
Imagine the shock and horror and outrage when we learned that
we had delivered her into the hands of an uncontrolled, manipulative,
evil, sexual predator,&quot; said one father.
<p>
The girls testified that their fear extended even to bucolic
Sisters High School where, under a previous
administration, Gage had conned his way in as a truant officer,
offered the services of his supposedly trained
drug-sniffing dogs. He had keys to the building, his partner
Karen Lee was on the school board. 
<p>
&quot;We could not go to the school (authorities). We would look
out the door of English class, expecting to see his
face,&quot; cried one girl. 
<p>
A Sisters teacher in the courtroom flinched as these words were spoken.
<p>
The girls told of how he gave favors of jewelry and privileges
to his &quot;special girls,&quot; the ones who did not or
could not resist his sexual advances.
<p>
In determining the sentence, Judge Tiktin first spoke to assuage
the guilt of parents and the girls. 
<p>
As a man who has seen much of the worst, as a man who must be
&quot;always suspicious and even cynical,&quot; Judge
Tiktin told them that &quot;I myself could have been deceived
by Mr. Gage ... (until yesterday), I think I failed to
grasp the character and scope of his crimes. 
<p>
&quot; ... what happened is not your fault,&quot; the judge
told parents and girls. He praised the courage of those girls
who came forward.

<p>
Judge Tiktin said that he believed Royal Haven &quot;was a scam
from day one.&quot; He spoke
of Gage's &quot;tremendous conceit and contempt of others, to
take these precious children as objects for your
sexual gratification ... the cruelty, the isolation, the
exploitation of their disaffection from their family.&quot;
<p>
At which time, Tiktin read the sentence, which added up to 45
years behind the walls of prison. The judge
established that Gage will always be under supervision as a
&quot;sexually dangerous offender.&quot; 
<p>
If he lives that long, Gage could get out after 36 years with
time off for good behavior, but even then he will
be 79 years old when he next breathes air as a free man.<br>

<a name="Samoa">
Lately, the operators of children's camps have found a new way
to get around those bothersome laws of which they keep running afoul:
move the camp to a foreign country which has few or no laws
governing such camps.

<p>
Pacific Coast Academy is nestled in the mountains of Samoa, more
than a thousand miles from any major country.
Many parents and former students across the West say the camp is
rife with physical, emotional and sexual abuse and has substandard
staff members and facilities.
<p>
Bob DeLancy, a Gilbert Arizona mortgage banker, visited his son at the
academy and helped videotape several students who were complaining
of sexual and physical abuse. After seeing the tape, officials at
the U.S. Embassy in Samoa helped remove 23 students. After a short
legal battle, 15 returned to the United States.
<p>
DeLancy said there was no sailing boat, helicopter or cattle ranch
that one promotional flier had touted. The staff had no doctors and
was lacking in qualified counselors and therapists, he said.

<p>
Lonnie Fuller, the Gilbert man who directed and co-owned Pacific
Coast Academy, said he has been unfairly criticized for helping people.
&quot;We're trying to do a good thing here, and we're getting
absolutely crucified,&quot; he said.

<p>
The involvement of Steve Cartisano, who marketed the camp until
Fuller &quot;fired him&quot; after the students were removed from
the camp, casts serious doubt on the academy's
reputation. Cartisano is banned from operating camps in Utah and
Hawaii and has been the subject of accusations of abuse or fraud
from a long line of parents and former students. In 1992, he was
tried for, but not convicted of, negligent homicide and child abuse
stemming from the 1990 death of 16-year-old Kristin Chase in the
camp he ran in Utah, &quot;Challenger&quot; wilderness camp.
<p>

Several parents said Cartisano exaggerated the amenities of Pacific
Coast Academy on the phone and often called himself &quot;Stephen
Michaels&quot; to hide his identity.
<p>
Fuller said he hired Cartisano out of pity but had to fire him because
of his lies and &quot;horrible&quot; history. &quot;His problems got
to be my problems,&quot; Fuller said. Both men worked together in
the late 1990s at another teen therapy camp in Samoa. New Hope Academy
folded in 1999 amid allegations of fraud and abuse. Fuller said he
left the camp long before then.

<p>
<a name="accreditation"> </a>
Pacific Coast Academy is not licensed or registered in the United States.
The academy's only accreditation is with the Samoan Youth Rehabilitation
Agency, Fuller said.
<p>

<font color="blue">
But wait! There's more! <i>It just keeps getting better and better!</i>
</font>

<p>
In an editorial in a Samoan newspaper on Feb. 17, 2000,
Savea Sano Malifa complained that the good name of Samoa was
being tarnished by those criminals from America, and...
<p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... an
American who is alleged to have been hounded by authorities in several US
cities, has been to Samoa, cashed a string of dud cheques in a bank, then
went back home where [he] is said to be in hiding. But before he left, he
reportedly created a corporation called &quot;Youth Rehabilitation
Administration Agency of Western Samoa&quot; which nobody seems to
know about.
<p>
The agency is supposed to issue licenses to overseas organisations applying
to open youth treatment centres in Samoa. They do this after checking out
the owners' facilities, compliance to regulations, education services, food
and medical services, environmental safety, and so forth.

<p>
This information is then passed on to clients, mainly parents of troubled
children in America. In other words, there's a scam going on using Samoa in
a fraudulent manner. Not surprisingly, the Ministry of Youth, Sports and
Culture has not heard of this organisation nor does it have a listing with
the Telephone Directory.

<p>
The Americans involved are reportedly Steve Cartisano (aka Steve Michaels)
of Arizona and Lonnie Fuller who is said to be still in Samoa. Neither of
them is on the telephone directory, nor is that other company they are
supposed to represent, Pacific Coast Academy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Editorial from the <b>Samoan Observor</b>,
<i>Troubled American teenagers in Paradise!</i>,
by Savea Sano Malifa (2/17/00)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So the &quot;accrediting agency&quot; that Fuller said certifies
the Pacific Coast Academy
is actually a fraud and a hoax created by Fuller and Cartisano so
that they could accredit themselves, huh?<br>

<font color="blue">
<i>They sound like just the kind of nice, reputable gentlemen you would
want to trust with your children's lives, don't they?</i>
</font>

<p>
But that still isn't nearly all of it. It just goes on and on.
Savea Sano Malifa continued the story, explaining that much earlier, Steve
Cartisano had conned an American businessman, Dan Wakefield, into
financing the founding of &quot;New Hope Academy&quot; in Samoa,
with promises of $10.9 million in profits from a
$25,000 start-up investment.
<p>

&quot;He told me, 'Dan, keep my enemies at bay and I'll make us
millions,' said Dan Wakefield, one of a group of Utah County
businessmen who hired Cartisano to help start Orem-based
New Hope Academy in the island nation of Samoa. &quot;But the
whole time we were paying all his expenses, he was conducting a
premeditated scheme to destroy the credibility and financial
stability of our company.&quot;

<p>
Cartisano completely mismanaged the business, and wrote $23,000
worth of fraudulent checks in just one week while Wakefield was
away from Samoa and not overseeing the project.
(So it turns out that Cartisano was that mysterious American who
kited all of the bad checks and then set up the
&quot;Samoan Youth Rehabilitation Agency&quot; before running
back to America.)
<p>

When the accusations and charges became too much, New Hope Academy
suddenly disappeared, and just as suddenly,
Steve Cartisano and Lonnie Fuller were
running &quot;Pacific Coast Academy&quot;, right next door.
When the problems at that camp became overwhelming,
Cartisano fled back to the USA, and went into hiding.
Dan Wakefield is still looking for Steve Cartisano,
trying to get his money back.

<p>
You know, I can certainly sympathize with the Samoans.
They don't need or want the bad publicity or the problems.
I suppose some white people in America might think that they are
just a bunch of primitive savages, living backwards lives
on their remote island. But the Samoans do not
send their children halfway around the world to be tortured
by strangers.
And the Samoans certainly don't build concentration
camps for their children in the USA.
It seems to take &quot;civilized&quot; people from Stateside
to commit such monstrous, insane crimes.
Funny that some people still think that the Samoan natives
are the savages...

<p>
One person who has had some luck in making contact with Steve
Cartisano is Jon Krakauer, who wrote an excellent article on
children's &quot;tough-love&quot; wilderness camps for
<i><b>Outside</b></i> magazine, called
<i>&quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160812030741/http://www.outsidemag.com/magazine/1095/10f_deth.html" target="_blank">Loving
Them To Death</a>&quot;</i>. (It is so good that it is simply
<i>MUST</i> reading. So read it.)
The most disturbing thing about the creeps who run those
camps is their completely unrepentant attitude, where they
seem to feel that a few children's deaths are normal,
acceptable losses, just part of the cost of doing business:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When asked about the deaths at Challenger, North Star, and other programs, Steve Cartisano calmly answers
that because wilderness therapy saves the lives of so many children, an occasional fatality is a regrettable but
justifiable cost of doing business. He calls it the &quot;window of loss.&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Jaggar and Henry apparently share this view,&quot; muses Bob Bacon, &quot;and I find that despicable. Nobody from
North Star has ever indicated to Sally or me that they are sorry for what they did to Aaron. Even now they seem
convinced that they were performing a benefit to society.&quot;
<br>
...<br>
Because Cartisano is being investigated for insurance fraud and other swindles, his precise whereabouts are a
sensitive matter that he prefers not to divulge. In a recent phone interview, however, he couldn't resist boasting
that he's &quot;running pretty much the same kind of program I've always run.&quot; At last report, he had raised tuition to
$20,000 and didn't lack customers. 
<p>
Unrepentant, Cartisano says plenty of parents still applaud his style of treatment. &quot;Our clients come from all over
the United States,&quot; he says of his current program, based in Costa Rica. &quot;I take kids sailing. We don't have to put
up with any ridiculous regulations or inspections down there. Things are going really well.&quot;<br></font>

Lou Kilzer, a Staff Writer for the <b>Denver Rocky Mountain News</b>
wrote an excellent piece of investigative journalism about the
crimes committed by a program called &quot;Teen Help&quot; &#8212;
<i>&quot;Abuse allegations fly / Government investigations, lawsuits claim
that youths were mistreated; Teen Help denies charges&quot;</i>,
<b>Denver Rocky Mountain News</b>, 07-20-1999.
In this article, Kilzer described how
Teen Help was a monster that spanned several countries:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Teen Help and its &quot;World Wide Association of Specialty Programs&quot;
acts as an umbrella organization that represents several
facilities around the world. They have been charged with many crimes.

<li> &quot;Teen Help activities touched off investigations by law
enforcement
or regulatory agencies in several states - including Utah,
South Carolina and Ohio - and three foreign countries - Mexico,
the Czech Republic and Western Samoa. Facilities in Utah, Mexico
and the Czech Republic were closed.&quot;

<li> One suit alleges that Teen Help's Paradise Cove compound in Western
Samoa uses a &quot;secret psychotherapy of threats, intimidation,
invasion of privacy, physical abuse, mental abuse, verbal abuse and
random punishment to break their captives' will and keep them confined.&quot;

<li> Another suit filed in June charges that &quot;homosexual attacks&quot; by
the staff at Paradise Cove &quot;were not only tolerated on these two
plaintiffs but threats of great bodily harm were made by these staff
members if any attempt were ever made by either plaintiff to communicate
information on the attacks to the outside world.&quot;

<li> Sunrise Beach in Cancun, Mexico, run by Glenda and Steve Roach,
was closed by Mexican police for a variety of charges.
&quot;After the newspaper Cronica de Cancun reported child abuse
allegations at the facility, Mexican authorities staged a surprise
raid. Police said they learned that some teens had been held in
punishment rooms for as long as four days at a time.&quot;

Police sent the inmates back to the USA and charged the Roaches with
immigration violations, among other things.<br>

<li> Cross Creek Manor, the girls treatment facility Teen Help
founder Robert Lichfield launched in 1990 in La Verkin, Utah,
was closed, because:
<ul>
<li> The State Health Department found it guilty of numerous
health, safety, and medical violations.<br>

<li> Cross Creek staff members used another facility,
Brightway Adolescent Hospital in nearby St. George.
for Teen Help's intake center,

<li> All teens arriving at Brightway were enrolled in a behavior management
program. But hospital records did not document what behaviors needed
managing.

<li> Of 198 teens entering Brightway during the last four
months of 1997, 154 were sent to Jamaica or Western Samoa.
&quot;No portions of patient records, including assessments
and treatment planning documentation, are forwarded to these
out-of-country programs,&quot; the report said.<br>

<li> Investigators analyzed the records of 14 recent patients. They found
that the same form letter had been sent to the parents of all 14,
saying that their teen needed &quot;12 months or more in the residential
treatment program in order to fully internalize the changes he needs
to make.&quot;

<li> Brightway was shut down because of all of those violations of
law and proper medical ethics and procedures.
</ul>

<li>
&quot;With Brightway closed and its intake services eliminated, Farnsworth
said
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>Teen Help now depends on statements from parents that their
children need to change their thinking.</b></font>&quot;<br>
<font color="#9f0000"><i>
The untrained parents psycho-analyze their children and decide what treatment
the children need. Unbelievable.
</i></font>

<li> In 1998, Glenda and Steve Roach &#8212; who had run Sunrise Beach near
Cancun &#8212; left to run a Teen Help compound in the Czech Republic.
&quot;The Roaches were charged under Czech law with cruelty to people
in their custody and with curtailing the students' freedom of movement,
police said.
Police said they had found diaries and other documents that confirmed
the allegations of abuse. Teens at Morava 'were often isolated and
denied food' and handcuffed, police said.&quot;<br>

<li> Carolina Springs Academy near Abbeville, S.C., promises a pleasant
stay in the country,
<ul>
<li> &quot;But investigators for the South Carolina Department of Social
Services found conditions there far less idyllic.
In the fall, the agency three times ordered the facility to close
because it was operating without a state license. Richard Byars,
Carolina Springs' director at the time, refused, saying the compound
was a boarding school, not a residential care facility, and didn't
need a license.&quot;<br>

<li> State social services investigators inspected the facility in December
and January. Their reports said that they found a <b><i>very</i></b>
long list of abuses and malpractice, including that:<br>

<ul>
<li> The doctor who was &quot;treating&quot; many of the teens never
actually visited the facility.<br>

<li> Several teens, including at least one who had attempted suicide
before arriving at Carolina Springs, no longer were taking medication
for depression.<br>

<li> One girl told them that another girl &quot;tried to kill herself.
She was hitting, kicking, spitting, etc. They said that her hands
were crossed over her chest and her wrists were handcuffed behind
her neck. They said duct tape was put over her mouth and around her
legs. At the top of the stairs, she jumped on her head to try to break
her neck so she could go to the hospital.&quot;<br>

<li> The social services agency said the staff members at Carolina
Springs weren't qualified to work with teens. Most of the staff's previous
work experience was nothing more than flipping burgers for minimum wage.<br>

<li> Children's records contained little information about previous
hospital stays and psychological evaluations.<br>

<li> Teens' letters home were censored to keep them from telling their
parents what was going on.
</ul>

<li> Both the state's Department of Social Services and the Department
of Health and Environmental Control sought court injunctions to order
the facility closed.<br>

<li> When this story ended, the facility was still open and still keeping
teenagers prisoner, while it and its lawyers negotiated with the
state agencies.
</ul>

<a name="Straight"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

It just seems like the drug and alcohol rehab business
is a fertile ground for the development of cults and similar crazy
groups.
Basically, that rehabilitation business is a dirty business that
most people don't want to get involved with, or even look at. Too
many government agencies are happy to hand out money to any organization
that claims to be solving the problem.
<p>

Straight, Inc. was a group that did just that: they claimed
to have taken the best of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="_blank">Synanon's</a>
methods while eliminating the
bad parts, and to have built a wonderful new treatment program
around those good ideas.
Straight used intensive peer pressure and a 12-step program similar to
Alcoholics Anonymous to rehabilitate adolescent drug users, according
to an organization brochure.
<p>
That was after Chuck Dederich had claimed that he had taken the best parts
of Alcoholics Anonymous and adapted them and made them into a great
new program for addicts, Synanon. (Note how the name Al-Anon morphed
into &quot;Synanon&quot; &#8212; &quot;sinners anonymous&quot; was actually
the original idea behind the name.) It's funny how the progression
from one recovery cult to the next is all downhill. A.A. begat
Synanon, which begat The Seed, which begat Straight, Inc., which
begat dozens of clones and copycats, including Miller Newton's
<b>KIDS of North Jersey</b>
and the Sembler family's <b>Drug Free America Foundation</b>.
And the whole mess of them abused children.

<p>
Somehow, a lot of people &#8212; so-called &quot;experts&quot;
&#8212; decided, early in the game, that Synanon
was a wonderful breakthrough in the treatment of drug addiction,
and that abuse by psychopaths really was
the best possible treatment for drug and alcohol problems.
And those &quot;experts&quot; don't seem to have ever bothered to
revise their
opinions when Synanon and all of its clones failed to produce the
desired results.
(They seem to have just decided that more funding and
more abuse was needed.)
We have had Synanon and a long list of Synanon copies
around for nearly half a century now, and our drug and alcohol problems
have not been cured by them. If anything, the problems are worse than ever.
The only thing those programs have accomplished is giving
gainful employment to some sadistic psychopaths, and even making
a few of them wealthy, and getting Melvin Sembler an ambassadorship.

<p>
<a name="Seed"> </a>
Straight, Inc. was one of the worst &quot;Coercive Rehabilitation
Projects&quot; that ever existed. (See
<a href="orange-letters13.html#Straight" target="_blank">a letter from a survivor</a>.)
Every single Straight facility
that was ever opened was accused of child abuse. Eventually,
they were all shut down while under criminal investigations or
facing civil suits.

Many people tried to emulate Synanon. Places like Daytop Lodge and Phoenix House in NYC. The
most successful for kids-only Synanon follow-on was The Seed founded in June 1970 in Fort Lauderdale by the
charismatic Art Barker. (Art had come from NYC). The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) was so
impressed with The Seed that it gave Barker a $1 million grant. Drug Czar Robert DuPont led NIDA while
Barker was being funded his grant money. Barker had visions of making Seeds all over the state of Florida and
then all over the country. But in 1974 the US Senate published a study which accused The Seed of using
methods which it likened to Communist brainwashing techniques. Besides this unwanted bad-press, The Seed
was having other difficulties. The Senate was cracking down on NIDA in its consideration of a request from
Barker for another cool million to expand his services throughout Florida. The Senate had told NIDA that
Barker was doing human experimentations and that NIDA's own regulations required the people being
experimented upon to sign statements of consent. And then there was the new host home regulations. The state
of Florida's HRS had adopted a set of standards of how to regulate the host home element of The Seed and
Barker said he had problems with those new regulations. Under the weight of all these problems Art Barker
gave up on his expansion plans.

Where did Straight, Inc. come from?
Wes Fager explains:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Robert L. DuPont, Jr., MD is the founding director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and is also the second White House
Drug Czar. While director of NIDA he administered funds for an
experimental, juvenile drug rehabilitation program in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida called The Seed. Later the U.S. Senate would
issue a report likening the methods employed by The Seed to
Communist brainwashing. Soon after that report was released Melvin
and Betty Sembler and some other former Seed parents opened their
own Seed-like program in Saint Petersburg, Florida which they called
Straight, Inc. After leaving NIDA Dr. DuPont became a paid
consultant for Straight and frequently represented Straight in civil
suits for which he was well paid. In one of those suits, in 1993,
Dr. DuPont testified that the progenitor of the Straight method was
a place called Synanon which he even admitted was a cult!
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
First Lady Nancy Reagan repeatedly praised Straight, Inc. for their
&quot;wonderful work.&quot;
But they, too, ended up being just another vicious cult that tortured
children in the name of &quot;rehabilitating&quot; young drug users,
and who hid the tortured children when Nancy and the news cameras
came to visit.

business, public service, politics, and
diplomacy, I have worked hard and accomplished
much... For the last quarter century, along
with my wife, I have fought vigorously against
the plague of drug abuse. In 1976 Betty and I
helped found STRAIGHT, a non-profit, adolescent

treated and graduated more than 12,000 young

Gradually, all of the Straight facilities were shut down amid
criminal investigations and civil lawsuits.
<p>
In February 2000, Rev. Miller Newton, Ph.D., Straight's former
national clinical director, closed down his Straight-copy facility
called KIDS of North Jersey, after Newton and his psychiatric staff settled
out of court with a female client for $4.5 million for the abuses
that she suffered at his program.

Father Cassian Newton.
<a href="orange-letters13.html#Straight" target="_blank">See this letter from
a survivor of Miller Newton's abuse</a> to get some idea of what Newton's treatment
of children was like.]</font>

<p>
Then new copies of <i>Straight</i> sprang up, opened by former employees of
the previous Straights, and they in turn were shut down in the same way.
But still more copies keep popping up, because the government
is still willing to pay money to have children incarcerated in
such facilities and &quot;treated&quot; for drug addiction, and the child abusers
have still not been put in prison. In fact, the Republicans keep giving them
more money to do it again. It's called &quot;helping children&quot;,
and &quot;the War on Drugs&quot;.

<p>
The &quot;Drug Free America Foundation&quot; is the current reincarnation
of Straight, Inc..

<p>
Straight continues to play a major role in shaping
up American drug policy.  Straight's former
national research director Dr. Donald Ian
MacDonald  went on to become the nation's drug
czar. Former drug czar Robert DuPont was a paid
Straight consultant.  Former drug czar Bob Martinez
appears to be tied to Straight too.
<a name="DFAF"> </a>
 Straight &#8212;
morphed into &quot;The Drug Free America Foundation, Inc.&quot; &#8212;
made drug policy recommendations to President-elect
George W. Bush who, as governor of Texas, has
teamed up with DFAF on one drug awareness initiative.

<p>
Melvin and Betty Sembler were rewarded for their efforts at
&quot;reforming children&quot; and
raising funds for the Republican Party with ambassadorships to Australia and Italy.
Melvin Sembler is still the U.S. ambassador to Italy now, under George W. Bush.
The powers that be have simply ignored the charges of child abuse, and have even
participated in covering them up.

The single
most dangerous and sadistic person I have ever met!!!!!!  I watched him pick up a 12
year old girl by the hair one day and drag her all the way across the warehouse that
we were in.... that's NOT a euphemism, we were kept in a WAREHOUSE all that time.
&nbsp; ...
<p>
The abuses that we were subjected to in there were beyond belief.
Starvation, beatings, sleep deprivation on a DAILY basis, kids being
punished with &quot;peanut butter diets&quot; where they got bread with
peanut butter on it 3 times a day with a dixie cup full of water.
<p>
The emotional abuse was the worst part for me.  The
whole thing of 'breaking them down and building them back up' was one of the most
depraved undertakings that I have come across.  The girls were all called sluts,
whores, bitches and more... never mind that some of them were 12 or 13 and VIRGINS.
There were quite a few of us in there who had been sexually abused as young children
and when we tried to talk about it we were told to &quot;focus on yourself and where YOUR
responsibility was... how in the HELL does ANYONE come up with a 7 year old having ANY
responsibility for something like that?

Remember that Dr. Miller Newton, <i>who is not a medical doctor</i>, had to
pay $4.5 million to settle one case of abuse and false imprisonment of
a young female patient. The threat of many more such expensive lawsuits
forced him to close down his programs and get out of the &quot;child

Miller Newton published a number of books where he espoused his
philosophy of child counseling. He even presumed to be qualified
to teach other child counselors how to treat children:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Your job is to be an adult whom the teen can rely on to protect him from his
own manipulation and high-risk behavior. The adolescent needs &quot;a caring adult&quot;,
not a buddy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Adolescence: guiding youth through the perilous ordeal</i>, Miller Newton,
M.Div., Ph.D., page 60.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Why is &quot;a caring adult&quot; in quotation marks like that? Is it a euphemism?
Is the &quot;counselor&quot; really something other than &quot;a caring adult&quot;?</i>
</font>
<p>
<font color="black">
And notice how Miller Newton just assumes that all teenagers are manipulative.
Newton's contempt for teens is barely veiled.
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... positive response from an adolescent patient has a special value to
therapists who need esteem-bolstering. This need to be liked sets the therapist
up to be manipulated by the patient.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Adolescence: guiding youth through the perilous ordeal</i>, Miller Newton,
M.Div., Ph.D., page 65.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
So was Miller Newton a &quot;therapist&quot; who needed esteem-bolstering?
<i>Well, no matter, Miller Newton sure didn't let himself get &quot;manipulated&quot;
by those schemings teenagers, did he?</i> He beat them and starved them
and screamed at them and pulled their hair every time they tried to
&quot;manipulate&quot; him.
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Negative countertransference has to do with the therapist reacting to the
patient in principally negative ways based on issues in the therapist's
own life. Negative countertransference, which usually takes place out of the
awareness of a counselor, is often harmful to the treatment process.
It is critically important in dealing with adolescents to survey personal
issues that may end up contaminating the therapeutic relationship.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Adolescence: guiding youth through the perilous ordeal</i>, Miller Newton,
M.Div., Ph.D., 1995, page 64.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Miller Newton wrote that text after having abused children in the <i>Straight</i>
and <i>KIDS</i> programs for more than ten years.
Whatever his personal issues were, he sure didn't keep them out of the
&quot;therapeutic relationship&quot;, did he?</i>
</font>
<p>
Miller Newton repeatedly cited himself as an authority on a variety of subjects.
On page 61, Miller Newton declared that &quot;blunt communication&quot; was effective in
dealing with teens. That statement was supported by endnote 77.
When we go to the back of the book and look at endnote 77, we see that Miller Newton
is citing another of his own books, published by himself, as
supporting his statements about how to treat children:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have found that effective therapy with most adolescents involves blunt
communication and that fairly directive responses to questions and behaviors
are more effective.<sup>77</sup><br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Blunt communication, huh? Like punching and hair-pulling?)
</font>

<p>
And on page 98, Miller Newton did it again.
He declared that sex was bad for teens, a statement that
was supported by endnote 122, which, in turn, cited that expert
on teen sex &quot;Father Newton&quot;:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Newton, M. (1986) <i>Kids, Drugs, and Sex</i>, Tampa: American Studies Press.
</font>

<p>
There are many more such examples. Miller Newton is one of the most-cited
authors in the endnotes of his books. Apparently, he considers himself
to be a real expert on how to help children.

It just goes on and on. Running children's gulags is big business.
It can be just as profitable as running residential drug and alcohol
rehab facilities for children. Sometimes, they are the same thing
&#8212; the same places.
<p>
<font color="black">
And, if you then give your ill-gotten gains to the Republican
National Committee, like Melvin Sembler did, you can become an
Ambassador, just like he did. So the money starts traveling in
a circular pattern: the Republican politicians give government money &#8212;
really, the taxpayers' money &#8212;
to Sembler for cruelly &quot;rehabilitating&quot; children,
and then he gives
the money back to those politicians via the Republican National Committee
so that they can get re-elected. After which, they give him more
money, which he gives to the Republicans, and the cycle repeats...
It's just a money-laundering machine that funnels money into the Republican Party, disguised as
an organization that helps children.

<p>
Then Sembler even ended up becoming the finance director of the
Republican National Committee.
It's understandable how the Bush administrations &#8212; all three of them:
George Senior, George Junior, and Governor Jeb Bush in Florida &#8212; all
think that
Melvin Sembler is a great child therapist and a noble soul who deserves
to be rewarded with a couple of Ambassadorships (Australia and Italy).
<p>
Then, Governor Jeb Bush even declared August 8, 2000,
<i>&quot;Betty Sembler Day&quot;</i> in Florida.
The apparent lesson here is that you can be any kind of a monster
or criminal that
you want to be, and abuse children all you want, if you just give the
corrupt politicians enough money to make it all okay.
(But wasn't that also the lesson of Enron? Anything is
okay if you pay the Republican National Committee enough...)

Jeb didn't choose to send Noelle to the &quot;wonderful&quot; Melvin and
Betty Sembler <i>Torture Center For Children</i>
that was handy, right there in Florida,
just down the road... No way. That kind of &quot;treatment&quot;
wasn't good enough for Bush family members; it's only good enough for your children.
Jeb wouldn't let Melvin Sembler's professional child abusers
get anywhere near his precious daughter.
Jeb sent Noelle to the upscale &quot;Center for Drug-Free Living&quot; in Orlando.

Those children's concentration camps have a cult-like
hierarchical power structure:
<ul>
<li> The leader becomes the unquestionable guru whose
word is law, an arrogant Pharaoh surveying his kingdom.

<li> The staff become the inner circle of followers,
sycophants who toady up to the leader, and then turn around and
act like insufferable little martinets towards the children over
whom they have power.

<li> Sometimes a third concentric ring of power develops,
where some of the most
senior of the children &#8212; the &quot;old-comers&quot; &#8212;
become bullying slave-drivers for the staff,
carrying out the orders of those above them, and abusing the smaller
children below them. (That was the case at the Buffalo Soldiers'
camp. When Anthony Haynes died, he was actually under the direct command
of a 17-year-old boy whose name the sheriff did not release.
<a href="#Haynes_death">See above</a>.)
</ul>

<p>
Then those camps usually teach some kind of fascist
dogma or philosophy which is supposed to reform the kids.

<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma" target="_blank">All of the dogma
is unquestionably correct</a>,
of course, because
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_guru_right" target="_blank">the guru is
never wrong</a>.
And all of the usual brainwashing and
indoctrination techniques are used, of course.
In 1974, the US Senate published a study which accused <b>The Seed</b>
(the Straight precursor) of using methods which it likened to
Communist brainwashing techniques.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Other forms of behavior modification techniques employ intensive
&quot;encounter sessions&quot; in which individuals are required to
participate in
group therapy discussions where intensive pressure is often placed on the
individuals to accept the attitudes of the group... Once the individual is
submissive, his personality can begin to be reformed around attitudes
determined by the program director to be acceptable. Similar to the highly
refined &quot;brainwashing&quot; techniques employed by the North
Koreans in the
early nineteen fifties, the method is used in the treatment of drug
abusers... &quot;The Seed&quot;, a drug abuse treatment program in
Florida that, until recently, received funding from the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare, is based on a similar philosophy.<br></font>

</blockquote>
<p>

Wes Fager commented,
<blockquote>
&quot;It is important [that] you understand that back
in the 1970s Senator Irvin was not conducting a study of <i>The Seed</i>,
he was studying any programs funded by the federal government which
used drugs, psycho surgery or thought control on American citizens
in possible violation of their constitutional rights. And it was
with that purpose in mind that he found out about <i>The Seed</i>.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>

<font color="blue">
<i>In 1975 The Seed closed all of its expansion
programs. In 1976 Melvin and Betty Sembler, along with some other
former Seed&#8212;Saint Petersburg, Florida, parents, opened Straight&#8212;Saint
Petersburg. Such behavior is commonplace.
Often, when one <i>children's-gulag</i> &quot;rehabilitation&quot; facility
is shut down for abusing children, the staff will simply open another one
under a different name, sometimes even in the same building.
For instance, Straight-Orlando was shut down for child abuse on
Aug 14, 1992. On the same day, Straight employees Michael
Scaletta, the executive director, and Loretta Parish, the
marketing director, opened a new program for children,
&quot;SAFE, Inc.&quot;, out of the same building.

It's funny how so many politicians and bureaucrats imagine that
Buchenwald look-alikes will be good for getting children off of
drugs. It does not seem to ever occur to them that child abuse and
bad environments are often what drove the kids to drugs and alcohol in the first
place.

The arrogant mind set that says that alcoholics and drug addicts must be sentenced to
cult religion meetings, like Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous,
and taught to pray, for their own good, is the same mind set as the one
that says that children must be sent to boot camps and abused for their own good.

<a name="Jonestown"> </a>

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones" target="_blank">Reverend Jim Jones'</a>
People's Temple was in the child rehab business, too.
Jones collected other people's children in two ways:
<p>
First off, Jim Jones pressured people in his own church to sign their
children over to the church
as a way of guaranteeing the parents' loyalty &#8212; he could then later use
their children to blackmail them into staying in the cult.
They could leave, but they wouldn't be able to get their children back.
Legally, Jones got away with it by arguing that the parents' prior
drug or alcohol habits had impaired them as parents, so the church
had to take over guardianship of the children.
Jones had a large staff of good lawyers, and never lost a child
custody case.
<p>

<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
Jim Jones also gathered all of
the foster children and wards of the court that his church could
handle, which brought in large amounts of cash, tens of thousands
of dollars per month. And his organization
publicized those activities as &quot;saving
children&quot;:<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Temple's own newspaper, <i>People's Forum</i>, cranked out
articles about how effectively Jones was helping children, as
well as other child-related articles...<br>

Newspaper rehashes of favorable articles bordered on the ridiculous &#8212;
for example, the column by Guy Wright in the <i>San Francisco
Examiner</i>, June 9, 1977. Entitled &quot;Fresh Start in a Jungle
for the City Misfits,&quot; the piece relied entirely on Jones
for information in telling how youngsters were going straight
in the jungle under the wise and kind tutelage of Father Jones.
Wright ended the article with this alleged statement by a troubled
teen-ager of his first day in Jonestown, as Jones described it:
<blockquote>
He [Jones] told about a new arrival who woke up to the tropical
dawn, the song of exotic birds, the soft kiss of the trade winds.
The young man threw his arms out and shouted, &quot;Man, the
Fillmore has seen the last of me!&quot;
</blockquote>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Children of Jonestown</i>, Kenneth Wooden,
page 110-111.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
In the end, 276 of the 278 children who were &quot;under the wise and
kind tutelage of Father Jones&quot; were murdered at Jonestown
on Jim Jones' orders.
Two smart, fast, and lucky kids escaped into the jungle;
all of the rest of the kids were given cyanide-laced 'Flavor-Aid' to drink.
So yes, the Fillmore really had seen the last of that young fellow.
An indeterminate number of children, possibly as many as 150 or 200,
who were the wards of the State
of California, were placed in the foster care of the People's Temple,
which garnered for Jim Jones tens of thousands of dollars per
month.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
It was blatantly illegal for Jones to remove those children from
the USA and take them to Jonestown, his commune in Guyana,
but the US embassy didn't press the matter.

<p>
The exact
count of wards of the court killed at Jonestown is unknown because the
politicians, bureaucrats, and judges who were responsible for
such gross bungling and incompetence refused to cooperate with
investigators, even with the Congressional GAO investigators.
We actually had judges refusing to complete and return questionnaires
to Congressional investigators. California Governor Jerry Brown's
office seized the People's Temple records and stashed them.
The California District Attorney's office had a lot to hide, because
it had been infiltrated by People's Temple members, and had refused
to investigate the People's Temple's abuse of children at times
when it might have saved the children's lives.
Everybody involved scrambled to cover his own ass, and hide his own
misconduct.

<p>
<a name="ftnt03_ret"> </a>
The cover-up was so complete that the US military personnel who got the
miserable job of gathering the bodies and returning them to the
USA, were instructed, on orders from the White House &#8212; specifically
from Robert Pastor,
of the staff of Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's National
Security Advisor &#8212; to remove
all identification documents and tags from the bodies, which made
it impossible for the coroners to identify many of
the deceased.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>

Thus, there has never been a final and full accounting of the
children whom Jim Jones &quot;got off of
drugs&quot; for the State of
California.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>

<p>
How could Jim Jones get away with such a thing?
<p>
Well, for a long time he had a lot of people fooled.
Jim Jones was named one of &quot;<b>The 100 Outstanding Clergymen in
America</b>&quot; by the Foundation for Religion in American Life
in 1975, and, in 1976, he was named &quot;<i>Humanitarian of the
Year</i>&quot; by the Los Angeles <i>Herald-Examiner</i>.
At the same time, San Francisco Mayor George Moscone appointed Jim Jones
<b>Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority</b>.
For a long while, the people in power in San Francisco thought that
Reverend Jim Jones was just the greatest religious leader, a real
crusader for &quot;clean and sober living.&quot;

The legal fees were money well spent as local courts found in Jones'

<a name="Jones_exhibiting"> </a>
<p>
What was not publicized in San Francisco back in 1974 and 1975 was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Early in 1975, Elmer and Deanna Mertle began to seriously consider leaving
the Temple.<br>
...<br>
As the Temple's membership grew, both Mertles felt that discipline was
replacing love as the first principle of life in the Temple.
At Temple meetings, they watched in horror as children and adults were
publicly paddled for such acts of misconduct as smoking a cigarette,
eating a Big Mac, or the cardinal sin of returning a Temple vehicle
with a parking ticket stuck to the windshield. Jones did not deny that
Temple discipline was tightening, but he justified the paddlings on two
grounds. Many of the new members who had grown up wild on the streets of
the big city needed to be impressed forcibly with the rules they were
expected to live by. In addition, Jones explained, as the Temple
grew and began to exercise its power in the community, it was
absolutely necessary that Temple members appear to outsiders as
paragons of good behavior. &quot;We cannot allow our enemies the
opportunity to exploit our weaknesses,&quot; he told Deanna Mertle
after Elmer Mertle's sixteen-year-old daughter was paddled for a
minor infraction.
<p>
Up to a point the Mertles accepted Jones's
explanations, but as Jones's perspective
grew ever more militantly political, the Mertles grew ever more unsure of
their commitment to the cause. Deanna Mertle especially had never wanted to be
a soldier in a ceaseless struggle against the capitalist power
structure and she had difficulty
understanding the sacrifices she was supposed to be making for a
cause she did not believe in. She was also frankly horrified by Jones's sexual
conduct and his interference in the sexual lives of his congregation.
<p>
Both Mertles were members of the Planning Commission, and during 1974 and 1975
Planning Commission meetings were becoming increasingly bizarre, especially
with respect to Jones's sex life.

It was not unusual for several hours of a meeting to be devoted to
Jones's sex life, all to advertise the proposition that
<font color="#9F0000">a night with Jim Jones was guaranteed to stimulate
revolutionary zeal in revolutionaries of both sexes.</font>
He ranted about bourgeois sexual attitudes, insisting that members
publicly confess their sexual fears and fantasies.<br>
...<br>
On another occasion, in a different mood, Jones forced a white man to
perform cunnilingus on a black woman during a Planning Commission meeting
as a public demonstration of his lack of racial prejudice.<br>
...<br>
While Jones contended that sexual frankness and communal urination were
merely symbolic demonstrations of the community's openness, Deanna Mertle
began to suspect that perhaps the real point was that the emperor had
no clothes; and, what was worse, there was nothing this emperor seemed
to like better than exhibiting himself to his subjects.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Awake in a Nightmare</i>, Ethan Feinsod, pages 41-42.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Elmer and Deanna Mertle legally changed their names to Al and Jeanne Mills
after they defected from the Temple. But that didn't save them; they and their
younger daughter were murdered in their home in Berkeley, California, presumably by one or more of
the surviving Temple goon squad members, shortly after the mass suicide in Guyana,
and just some months after Jeanne published a book, <i>Six Years with God</i>,
that revealed the inner workings of the Temple. Jim Jones had, before
his death, made his wishes about Jeanne Mills very clear &#8212; he wanted
her gone, eliminated, for saying bad things about him and his Temple.

<p>
<a name="ftnt05_ret"> </a>
<a name="ftnt06_ret"> </a>
And Jones was such a monster that...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Mama died [of cancer] in Jonestown ten days before the massacre, with Larry never
leaving her bedside. She died without pain medication because Jim [Jones] had consumed
it himself. For two months Larry watched our mother drift away from life without
any relief from her agony until she finally succumbed to her lung cancer.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><b>Seductive Poison</b>, Deborah Layton, 1998, page 297.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You mean Jim Jones took a dying woman's pain-killers so he could get high on
them himself? In a word, yes. Now that is cold, really cold.
(But so is making 914 people, including their children and babies, commit suicide for you.)
<p>
Jim Jones passed the People's Temple off as the most successful drug and
alcohol rehabilitation program in California for a while,
but in the end, Jim Jones was whacked out on stolen drugs all of the
time.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt05">5</a></sup></font>

His autopsy revealed that he had so much pentobarbital in his system
that he would have died of an overdose if he had not built up such
a huge tolerance to the
stuff.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font>

<p>
That's quite some <b><i>Humanitarian of the Year</i></b>.<br>
That's quite some Holy Man.<br>
That's quite some foster father for 150 wards of the court.<br>
That's quite some Director of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program.
<p>
<br>
Obviously, some
of the pundits didn't check the facts very closely before handing
out the accolades. With drug and alcohol rehab programs, it seems
like they rarely do. They seem to believe that if you are working
with alcoholics and drug addicts, then you must be a saint, because
nobody else wants that stinking job.
<p>
But hey, I guess we can cheerfully, mindlessly yammer the platitudes
about how it was really a great organization because it really helped
some people to get off of drugs and alcohol...

This is <i>MUST</i> reading. If you don't go read anything else, read this:<br>
Jon Krakauer, <i>Loving Them to Death</i>, <b>Outside</b> Magazine,
October, 1995.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160812030741/http://www.outsidemag.com/magazine/1095/10f_deth.html" target="_blank">

&#8212; Excellent, must reading. Good story-telling, too.
This covers a lot of the children's deaths and
a lot of the issues with &quot;tough-love&quot; wilderness programs.<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
(By the way, the &quot;Jon Krakauer&quot; who authored that article is
the same Jon Krakauer as the one who is famous for the book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;,
about the disastrous summer of deaths of climbers on Mount Everest.
That book is a first-hand account of Krakauer's experiences while climbing Everest.
So it is no accident or coincidence that Jon Krakauer is writing articles for <i>Outside</i> magazine.<br>
Then Krakauer wrote <i>Under the Banner of Heaven</i>, about some fanatical
fundamentalist Mormons murdering people in Utah.)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gov. Bill Janklow, who credits three years in
the Marine Corps with turning his life around, called five years
ago for boot camps as a way to teach teenage offenders the discipline
and skills needed to set them straight.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The Republican governor has blamed &quot;rogue employees&quot; for
Score's death and other problems.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

But Democratic House Minority Leader Pat Haley said the problem is
widespread.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

&quot;What was put together here was a routinely abusive system,&quot;
said Haley, a former prison guard. &quot;It wasn't rogue employees.
It was the system.&quot;

<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;It now appears that little has been done either by the state of California
or by the federal government since 1986 to assure that these children are
not placed in these facilities and financed with inappropriate federal
funds. And it is likely that the very same abuse is occurring
with both in-state and out-of-state placements by many states at a cost
to the federal taxpayers of many millions of dollars a year. We intend
to find out if that is the case, to force the states to stop misusing the
federal dollars, and force the federal government to more tightly oversee
claims for federal reimbursements from the states.&quot;
<p>

&quot;I find it hard to believe that HHS, after being warned about abuse by
California in 1986 and again by GAO in 1990 about 'systematic and ... widespread'
abuses, has not properly controlled these improper uses of federal funds.
We were told by President Reagan's HHS Secretary that changes were being
made; it appears that little ever changed.&quot;<br></font>

<blockquote>
The Justice Department's 38-page report, which detailed abuse in
boot camps, lack of education and mental health services throughout
the system, ought to concern everyone. It's not just putting kids
away that makes communities safer, but also whether they come out
any better for the experience. With a 70 percent recidivism rate,
something's not working, despite Commissioner Eugene Walker's
commitment to more diversion programs and follow-up for troubled
kids.

James Garbarino, <i>Boys who go bad</i>, <b>The Toronto Star</b>,
04-24-1999.<br>
&#8212; What to do with murderous boys? Garbarino says that boot camps
don't work; they shame and traumatize the boys, and teach the boys
that violence is how you solve your problems and get people to
do what you want.<br>

&#8212; In other words, boot camps teach young thugs to be tougher,
more violent and more insane young thugs, just as callous, mean and crazy
as their &quot;drill instructors&quot;.<br>
<font color="blue"><i>
&#8212;  It isn't any coincidence then,
that many of the boot camps end up being partly run by
&quot;old-comers&quot;, the most senior students, who work as
slave-drivers for the adult staff. They were abused
by the adult staff, and then they turn it around and
work at abusing the younger, newer inmates for those adult staffers.
Remember that Anthony Haynes
was under the direct command and supervision of a 17-year-old assistant
counselor when he died. It was a 17-year-old kid who kept Anthony
Haynes standing in the blazing 111-degree desert sun, in a black
uniform, for four hours, without any water.
Where do you think that young
&quot;drill sergeant&quot; learned to be so sadistic?
At the Buffalo Soldiers' boot camp, of course.

counter what they say is unfair and, in some cases, unfounded criticism.<br>
...<br>

Federal officials threatened to file suit against the state if conditions were not corrected
within 49 days. But after several meetings between Gov. Zell Miller and federal
officials, an agreement was reached in which the state said it would spend $65 million to
address specific shortcomings identified in the Justice report.

Ultimately, the fix included shutting down the Georgia boot camps.

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A class-action lawsuit was filed yesterday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore
on behalf of youths who went through the state of Maryland's abusive juvenile
boot camps &#8212;  along with a proposed settlement reached between the youths
and the state. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The legal actions stem from allegations that staff members regularly
assaulted
youths who were sent to the three military-style camps in Western Maryland
from 1996 to 1999, the year the camps were ordered closed. Among the
injuries
inflicted by camp guards were broken bones, chipped teeth, lacerations,
deep bruises and limb dislocations that required surgery to correct.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Under the proposed settlement, which involves 890 youths and 14 plaintiffs'
attorneys, the state will pay $4.6 million. The youths were ages 14 to
17 when they were sent to the camps.

&#8212;  &quot;Maryland's system of probation for juvenile offenders is so
troubled that it is failing to provide youths with sufficient services
to keep them from reentering lives of crime, according to a report
released yesterday by a gubernatorial task force.&quot;

<i>Spare the rod and save the child: Harsh punishment for young
offenders doesn't work</i>, <b>Vancouver Sun</b>, 01-24-2001.<br>
<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commissioned in the aftermath of the Columbine high
school massacre, the report is a combined effort of such respected agencies
as the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Centre
for Injury Prevention and Control, the National Institutes of Health,
the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration. It offers findings that will
likely dismay those who advocate a more draconian approach to the
punishment of youth crime. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It skewers as a self-comforting myth the belief
that getting tough with juvenile offenders will deter them from future
violence.
