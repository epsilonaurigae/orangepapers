Hello Terrance &#8212;

<p>
Anon here again.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters370.html#Matt_J" target="_blank">
Whatever Richard Maybury may think</a>, the British Empire was still around for a good
half-century after Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone (1809-1898) departed this
life.

<p>
Some important dates. It was only in the late 1940s that the Union Jack came down in
Palestine and India.

<p>
Ghana became independent in 1957. And Harold Macmillan delivered his prophetic &quot;Wind
of Change&quot; speech in Capetown, South Africa, in February 1960, signalling a general
African emergence from colonial status.

<p>
As to Gladstone &#8212; in the words of Harvard historian Crane Brinton (&quot;A History of
Civilization,&quot; 1960), he &quot;regretted and no doubt even neglected the Empire; but he
kept it.&quot;

<p>
If RM is untrustworthy about such matters as these, what else, you wonder, can he be
getting wrong?

<p>
*****************

<p>
TH &#8212; if you want to use the above, that's fine, but I'd prefer that it not get
personal. Re-write it as you please and call me &quot;Anon&quot; if that's allowed.

<p>
That's because RM strikes me as an out-and-out crackpot. His language is a dead
giveaway. I was in the newspaper business for 30 years and believe me I know the
type. Can't be argued with.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Anon,
<p>
Thanks for the information. What I find really interesting is the possibility
that someone can be a crackpot and also be correct about something. There is no
doubt that the empires are coming down. The old Soviet Union has fallen apart.
And yes, the British Empire is gone. And the American Empire (which many Americans
insist does not exist) is also rapidly disintegrating.  At the same time, the
Chinese would love to build up their own empire. But the world may run out of oil
just in time to prevent that.  The future is going to be very interesting.
<p>
(Remember that &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot; was an old Chinese curse.)
<p>
By the way, PBS (Public Broadcasting System, i.e. television) just ran a series here
about Queen Victoria and it featured the Gladstone versus Desraeli rivalry, and
described how whether the British empire expanded depended on which of them was
Prime Minister. And how Prince Albert was against expansion of the empire, but
he died, which totally changed British history, because Albert was replaced by
Desraeli as Queen Victoria's advisor and close friend, and Desraeli was very
pro-empire. So it goes.
<p>
It's frightening how the course of history can be altered by a germ.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Hey orange,

<p>
Good to read some stories here, I thought I was alone. My now ex partner
who I had known for almost thirty years decided after a breakdown due to
synthetic marijuana and alcohol addictions to join aa. Of course I thought
this was great, however after about a week they told her I was a trigger?
Even though I don't smoke any sort of drugs and only drink socially. They
then went as far as saying sex and even seeing me was a trigger and to
leave me asap. I told her I understand and have tried to stay out of her
life. She has changed drastically, to the point I don't feel I know her any
more, and all she talks about is the 12 steps always texting me saying I'm
an alcoholic and trying to give me advice. I have had to delete her off my
phone, facebook and even email. She is a zombie brainwashed by bullshit and
I'll never get my girl back. AA sucks.

Hello  CJ,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your loss. Alas, that story is
so commonplace.  I've heard it so many times. Crazy A.A. members actively seek
to destroy new members' outside relationships  &#8212; that is, any relationship
that is not with another A.A. member. That is just standard cult behavior  &#8212; 
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_total_immersion" target="_blank">socially isolate the new members</a>.

<p>
Then
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_self_absorbed" target="_blank">they make the new members obsessed with the cult</a>.
It becomes their whole life. Cult members walk around reciting the cult's
&quot;holy dogma&quot;, and they spend all of their time in meetings, or
&quot;Bible study&quot; (or whatever book is the cult's &quot;holy book&quot;), or recruiting,
or fund-raising.

<p>
And
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_enemy" target="_blank">outsiders are the enemy</a>.
You will &quot;trigger her&quot;, they say. In other cults, they would say that you
tempt her to sin, and lead her away from Heaven, or distract her from the goal,
or make her forget her dreams, or pollute her with impure and insane thoughts, or some such thing.
<p>
(By the way, if you click on the above links, they will take you to questions in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>.
You can go to the answers for A.A. by clicking on the number of the question.)

<p>
Then
<a href="orange-letters113.html#apophenia" target="_blank"><b><i>apophenia</i></b></a>
sets in and they see everybody who takes an occasional drink as a hard-core
alcoholic who is in need of their program of salvation.
<p>
By the way, they say that you having sex with her is supposedly a trigger? But I'd bet that
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">their next lesson for her</a>
is that sex with them is not a trigger. What a bunch of digusting creeps.

<p>
Oh yes, that is all standard A.A. behavior.
<p>
I wish I had some easy magic bullet to fix the problem, but I don't. Once the cult gets its claws
into somebody, it really has her. It may take years for her to get out.
She is not listening to reason because she does not want to.
They have convinced her that
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank">to question A.A. dogma is to die</a>.
And
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank">A.A. is <i>the only way</i></a> to survive.


<p>
I'm adding this story to

You can tell the males from the females easily: the mature males have a bright red head, and the immature
males have a splash of red on the throat, while the females always have green heads and throats.
<p>
By the way, how these hummingbirds got that name is simple: The ornithologist who named them had a 
girlfriend named &quot;Anna&quot;, so he named this hummingbird after her.

<p>
It is easy to attract a bunch of these hummingbirds: just put up a bunch of hummingbird feeders.
I have four up: three in the back yard, and one hanging from the front porch, and they all get a bunch of
visitors. Hummingbirds are very intelligent when it comes to remembering where to find food.
Once they find your feeders, they won't forget them, and you will find that some hummingbirds will
visit the same feeder at the same time every morning. Like 7:30 in the morning, every morning,
the front porch feeder gets a hungry visitor who wants breakfast.
 And the feeders in the back yard get visitors every evening.
Your feeders become a regular part of their daily route.
<p>
PBS Television had a program about hummingbirds where they said that hummingbirds
were so good at remembering food sources &#8212; because they have such high energy
needs &#8212; that they will remember what kind of flowers bloom where, and when
they come into bloom, and how often the hummingbird can visit those flowers to
get another meal. In other words, how soon the flowers can refill
themselves with nectar. And they remember all of that on a flower
species-by-species basis. So a hummingbird does not just bumble around looking
for flowers, he has a whole flight plan in his head. Wild animals are not as
stupid as some people think.

<p>
The hummingbirds learn that my feeders have a limitless supply of sugar-water.
They cannot drink enough to empty the things. And if they do manage to empty one,
they can just go to the others. That is an advantage to having four feeders out
&#8212;  Even if they empty one, they can still get a meal from the others.
<p>
Also, having multiple feeders out there means that they don't have to fight over one.
Hummingbirds are very territorial and agressively defend their food supply (for good reason),
but with several feeders around,
one hummingbird can be feeding at the front porch while another feeds in the back yard,
and they don't need to fight over the food supply. They don't even see each other.

<p>
The formula for the sugar-water is simple: 4 to 1. That is, four cups of water to
one cup of white sugar.  Heat it to a boil to sterilize it, and then cool it down
(so that you don't melt the plastic hummingbird feeders) before pouring it into
the hummingbird feeders. Also clean the feeders thoroughly between refills to
remove all traces of algae and bacterial growth.
<p>
Which leads to the question of honey. The most knowledgeable people say that you
should not use honey because it ferments quickly. Honey-water will start to ferment in
as little as 8 hours. And it can be poisonous in a couple of days. If you put
honey-water in the feeders, you need to dump it and replace it every day. That
is a lot of work, and a lot of waste. White sugar works better. And brown sugar
is too heavy for their stomaches.  Besides, the authoritive people say that white
sugar is actually more similar to their natural nectar sources.
<p>
Still, they like the taste of honey.
<a href="orange-letters20.html#hummingbird" target="_blank">When I was caring for my sick hummingbird</a>,
I alternated between giving her sugar-water and honey-water. She seemed to like
both. But I was keeping the honey-water refridgerated to prevent fermentation,
and warming it up to room temperature in the microwave just before feeding
with a baby eye-dropper (really, a baby feeding tool)
&#8212; <b>only</b> heat it up to room temperature &#8212; not hot &#8212; don't
burn their little mouths. And I was discarding the old solution every day or two
to remove the danger of old honey-water fermenting. She did great on that diet,
and recovered nicely.
<p>
But lest anyone get the impression that you can keep hummingbirds in captivity,
remember that nectar is only half of the hummingbirds' diet, and with Anna's
Hummingbirds, it's the smaller half at that. They also need to eat lots of tiny
insects like gnats and fruit-flies, for the protein.  They cannot live on just
sugar. If I had it to do over again, I would have used old fermented fruit to
attract fruit flies, and put the bait in the hummingbird's cage where she could
snack on the fruit flies when they flew into her cage. As it is, she did okay
anyway because I kept her for less than two days. Any longer than that and she
would have started to get sick from protein deficiency.

</center>

<p>
By the way, hummingbirds chirp. They have a tiny high-pitched little squeek. Once you learn
what it sounds like, you can tell when you have a hummingbird in your yard. (Provided that you
have your windows open, and live in a quiet neighborhood.)

These pictures are so speckly because they were shot in dim light, in the shade
of a tree, and I had to turn the ISO up to maximum to get acceptable brightness,
and that amplifies the sensor noise. With these conditions,
you have to choose the worst combination of settings: You have to use a telephoto lens, which
reduces the brightness that the sensor gets, then you have to set a very fast shutter speed to
keep the hummingbird from being just a blur, and then you have to set the ISO to maximum.
All of that maximizes the sensor noise.  Next year, I'll make some way to hang the
hummingbird feeders in the sunshine, rather from tree branches in the shade of
a tree, and that will improve the photographs.

Hello Annette,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. That subject line is very revealing. It sounds like you have
quite a resentment there. Didn't Bill Wilson say something about how you cannot have
a resentment?


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Resentment is the number one offender. It destroys more
alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual
disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill,
we have been spiritually sick.<br>
</font>

<i>How It Works</i>, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But with the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth
of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is
infinitely grave.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 66.</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
So I guess you need to work on that resentment while you are &quot;working the program&quot;.

<p>
Speaking of which, how do you define &quot;working the program&quot;?
Lots of Steppers parrot that line about working the program, but they don't say what they mean.
<p>
So what do you have to do to work the program?
<p>
<ol>
<li> It can't be going to A.A. meetings.  That is optional.
You can go to as few or as many as you like.
In the early days of A.A., Bill Wilson bragged about
the &quot;lone wolf&quot; members of A.A. who just ordered the book and read it,
and got sober, and never went to a meeting.
<p>
<li>  It can't be working the 12 Steps, because they are only suggestions.
You don't have to work the Steps. Bill Wilson said so in the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
<li> It can't be reading the <i>Big Book</i>. I've had people email me and say
that my criticism of what is in the <i>Big Book</i> is irrelevant, because they
have many years of sobriety and they have never read the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
<li> It can't be &quot;Coming to Believe&quot; in &quot;Higher Power&quot; (or <i>Doorknob Almighty</i>,
or <i>Baal Bedpan</i>, or the Easter Bunny, or whomever it is).
That is also optional.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">Bill Wilson said that you didn't have to believe anything</a>.
And A.A. defenders routinely brag to me about the atheist chapters of A.A.
<p>
<li> It can't be getting a sponsor. Lots of sober people tell me that they never had a sponsor.
<p>
<li> It can't be recruiting. Some A.A. members brag to me that they have never gone recruiting.
<p>
<li>
Now here is the most important question: Do you have to quit drinking in order to work the program?
If so, then you have a circular definition there. You have to quit drinking in order to
work the program, and then you have to work the program in order to quit drinking.

<p>
That is nonsense, of course. It's like saying that you have to eat vanilla ice cream in order
to eat vanilla ice cream.
<p>
On the other hand, if you don't have to quit drinking in order to work the program, then
how does the program make people quit drinking?

</ol>

<p>
So what do you mean when you say, &quot;work the program&quot;?

<p>
Have a good day now.

No resentment here, &quot;ass hole&quot; it's your new nickname! I'll pray for

Subject:  	Concerning your website<br>

<p>
Hi,
<p>
I was looking for alternative information about A.A. and I came across your
website, which I love. I'm doing an essay for a class, concerning
Alcoholics Anonymous and I love everything that you have written, however,
I have ran into a problem, my instructor has told me that I can not
validate your website because it has no information on the author, such as
background studies, this is exactly what she posted to me.
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
[This source cannot be used because it is impossible to determine who A.
Orange is, what is professional and educational background is, or what
qualifies him as an expert in the topic. I found his site; he or she offers
no profile or explanationof expertise. Nor could I find his biography by
searching on Google.]
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Is there any place that I can find your information so I can use what you
have found for my essay. Either way I can validate the information, but I'd
rather give you the acknowledgement for finding all of the sources. I would
really appreciate it and would of course be willing to donate to your cause.
<p>
Thank you,<br>

Hello Sara,
<p>
Thanks for the question. Actually, I've included a lot of autobiographical information in
the web site, more than I wanted to, really, because the web site is about A.A. and recovery
from alcohol abuse, not about me. The biographical information is just spread out here and there.
<p>
My birth name is Terrance Hodgins, and I'm a 66-year-old guy who lives in Forest Grove, Oregon,
which is a small town west of Portland.
And I'll have 13 years of sobriety in three more days. That includes 13 years off
of drugs and cigarettes too.
<p>
Here is a list of pieces of autobiographical information.
The most complete autobiography is the one written for SOS.

I never set out to create any such thing. I was just going to write a 30-page

use in treatment programs.

</ol>
<p>
Oh by the way, speaking of credentials, definitely read the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>,
because it is loaded with doctors' and professors' reports on the ineffectiveness of A.A.
and 12-Step treatment.
Even if your teacher won't let you quote me because she doesn't like my credentials,
 you can quote the people in that file
because they all have letters like &quot;M.D.&quot; and &quot;Ph.D.&quot; after their names.

<p>
Have a good day now, and good luck with your work.

Orange, many of the DUI teachers in California have criminal records and
the owners don't bother to run a background check. Some of them are very
dangerous and students have no idea that their counselor has criminal
record.

Subject:  	Dui counselors<br>

<p>
Most people who get  one DUI are not alcoholic and they are forced into
6  AA meetings and have to sit and listen to 12 step counselors who are
very often felons as their DUI teachers in class. The school owners
don't run back ground checks on these counselors. Most of the teachers
just spew AA jargon. No regular business would hire these people but
people who are caught drinking and driving have to suffer months
listening to these ignorant cult members.
<p>
Please do not include my name due to revenge by AA members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello S.,
<p>
Thanks for the letters. I can only totally agree. &quot;Drug and Alcohol Counselor&quot; is often the
only job for which those burned-out old alcoholics and drug addicts are qualified.
All that they can do is jabber slogans about addiction and recovery, and imagine that they
have some great wisdom.
And to get &quot;qualified&quot; to be a licensed D+A counselor, they only have to
take a course of training that teaches them how to recruit for Alcoholics Anonymous
and Narcotics Anonymous.
<p>
Heck, my &quot;counselor&quot; in outpatient &quot;drug and alcohol treatment&quot;
here in Portland jabbered 12-Step slogans at us,
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;I'm teachable today.&quot;
<li> &quot;I don't know if I will relapse tomorrow.&quot;
<li> &quot;Your disease wants to kill you.&quot;
<li> &quot;You need a Higher Power in your recovery program.&quot;
<li> &quot;Go to at least three meetings a week and get a sponsor.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't quit smoking. If you put too much on your plate, something might spill off.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
And then he went home and
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Christina" target="_blank">snorted cocaine and
looked at child pornography on his computer and then raped his step-children</a>.
And the taxpayers actually paid for all of that.
<p>
They busted him, and convicted him, and shipped him off to the state penitentiary.
Yes, that was quite an education I got at taxpayer expense.

<p>
The situation really has to improve.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Disturbing Experience in AA chat room

<p>
Hi guys,
<p>
13 days sober here and was spending the past week or so in an iPhone AA chat
room getting support and making new friends. I'm also in an intensive
outpatient group program for three hours per day as well (by my own choice),
and have attended two AA face to face meetings so far.

<p>
After talking with a young girl last night for about two hours, sharing some
of my experience with her and relating with her about my college years and
dealing with parents and such, we finished up and she went about her way. A
guy who who holds online meetings must have been following our conversation.
He came in and typed the following: 15 years of experience vs 12 days,
lol... !!! I was shocked and then became enraged at what I thought he meant:
that you bring no experience or wisdom to the table whatsoever though you
have lived 36 years.

<p>
My question to you is this: does AA teach people to devalue life experience
gathered along the way? Because I've gathered plenty. As we all have I'm
sure. I was very very insulted and felt belittled by his comment.

<p>
Not looking forward to interacting with or attending any more meetings...<br>

About the respect, the only one to comment on is the
years of sobriety. You are displaying a typical A.A. attitude where people
are worth more if they have more years of sobriety. I reject that idea, even
though I now rate as one of the &quot;holy old-timers&quot;. The virtue of a person is
not determined by how many years he has abstained from drinking alcohol.
Heck, even Jesus Christ turned water into wine and drank it.

By the way, I just had another anniversary, so it's seven years now. So that

Hello David,
<p>
You are authorized in the forum now. Welcome.
<p>
About the A.A. game of one-upmanship &#8212; yes, they still do that, don't they? They aren't about
to knock it off. Heck, many years of sober time (or claimed sober time) is the only rank
and status that some of them have in their lives. And it's sad that they feel so inadequate that
they have to flaunt it and lord it over newcomers.

<p>
Oh, and coincidentally, in two more days I'll have 13 years sober and off of drugs too. And in
three more weeks, 13 years off of cigarettes. I must be almost a God now. :-) 
<p>
J.R. Harris saw that same A.A. put-down of the newcomer and posted it in the forum, here;
<p>
The one thing that puzzles me is, &quot;Don't the old A.A. members get it? Can't they see that they
are driving people away from A.A. by treating newcomers like that? Are they blind?&quot;
No wonder A.A. is shrinking.
<p>
So much for A.A. offering the newcomers unconditional love and wise, compassionate, advice and counseling.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange,  I look forward to reading on this great site. Been sober 25hrs
and literally have had little to no depression since I started the
deprogramming process about two weeks ago. I really had no idea, although,
I've questioned aa for years. I just thought it was the only way. That I'd

Hello A. Orange,

<p>
Are you an alcoholic? If so, were you able to stop drinking without AA? If so, do
you feel content in your life without alcohol or do you long to drink and actively
fight the urge? Any information would be helpful.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Erin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the questions. And the answer to pretty much every question is &quot;yes&quot;.
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> I am, or was, an alcoholic. Whether it's present or past tense
depends on your definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
A.A. uses multiple definitions of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;, and mixes them up, which confuses the
issue.

<p>
<a name="definitions"> </a>
<blockquote>
The definitions are:
<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol,
almost allergic to alcohol, perhaps a genetic alcoholic; someone who cannot drink
even one drink or his drinking will spin out of control and he will
become readdicted to alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is somebody who cannot quit drinking &#8212; he is
&quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">an insane sinner who is full of disgusting character defects</a>
and moral shortcomings and resentments and barely-contained anger,
and is a prime example of self-will run riot and
instincts run wild and selfishness and self-seeking and the Seven Deadly Sins,
although he doesn't think so...  etc., etc., ...
</ol>
<p>
When I call myself an alcoholic, I usually mean definition 2, and only occasionally
definition 1, but never definitions 3 or 4.
<p>
<ol>
<li> By definition 1, I stopped being an alcoholic 13 years ago.
<li> By definition 2, I will always be an alcoholic.
<li> By definition 3, I wasn't an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking, and I did.
I was not &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
I even quit drinking without any help from A.A., because I quit drinking two weeks before I
was ever <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">sent to an A.A. meeting</a>.

<li> By definition 4, I was never an alcoholic. I was always a nice drunk.
People liked having me at their parties because I was so much fun to have around
when I got high. (But, as one friend said, &quot;Even nice drunks die of
cirrhosis of the liver...&quot;)
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><li> Yes, I stopped drinking without A.A. Tomorrow, I shall have 13 years of perfect sobriety.
Yes, it's my &quot;birthday&quot;.
Also 13 years off of drugs. And in three more weeks, I'll have 13 years off of cigarettes, too.
And I did it, and do it, without A.A.
<p>
I totally reject the entire A.A. program and their goofy ideas that unconfessed sins make you
drink alcohol, and if you confess enough, God will make you quit drinking.
And you must &quot;surrender to God&quot;, which really means that you must surrender to your sponsor
and the other A.A. elders and do what they say.
And don't take medications, trust the 12 Steps to heal you.
And
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">you are just a disgusting sinner</a>,
full of selfishness and resentments, and
you are manipulative and always wanting to do it your way, and you 
are dishonest and in denial.
That is crazy. That is raving insanity. That is just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's old cult religion from
the nineteen-thirties</a>.
<p>
And I haven't been to an A.A. meeting in almost 12 years. After about 3 months of exposure to
A.A., I said that I didn't need it, it's just a crazy cult, and only went
to meetings to pick up sobriety coins as they came due. The one-year coin is the
last one that I ever went and got.

<p><li>
I feel content with my life. I'm relatively happy.
I'm not crawling the walls for a drink. I did have more urges and
desires and cravings before, for the first couple of years, but they faded out.
If it weren't for this web site, I could go days or weeks without even thinking about drinking.
I have fun doing other things.

</ol>

<p>
What helped me a lot in the beginning was coming to understand
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">the Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
That is the primitive part of the base brain that just wants food and sex and feel-goods all
of the time.
He will always insist that having just one is okay, and we deserve to relax and feel good tonight.
It doesn't matter whether he wants sex or food or a cigarette or a hit of dope or a drink,
he always wants &quot;a little something&quot;. Remember Pooh Bear? As he hungrily rubbed his belly,
he said, &quot;I just need <i>a little something</i>.&quot;

<p>
Discovering what the Lizard Brain's game was,
 and how he would try to fool me into thinking that his thoughts
were my thoughts, and his desires were my desires, helped me a lot to detach from those thoughts
and desires and refute them.
When you realize that the urges and desires and thoughts
in your head are really just the yammering of a thirsty toad
brain who is actually very stupid, then they lose their power over you.
<p>
So go ahead and click on this link and learn about him:
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">the Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.

<p>
Also, I wrote up this reply three years ago, about the time that I got 10 years of
sobriety, and it's still true:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

questions. You can also join the forum if you want more people to chat with, and another
way to ask questions and discuss ideas.

Subject:  	13th stepping movie<br>

<p>
Hi Terrance,
<p>
It has been a while since I last wrote.   I keep reading your web site after now
about two years, and still I am amazed.  I had been in AA/Al-Anon for over 18 years
and found for the last couple years I attended that I felt like a trained parrot
repeating the same bullshit over and over.  I stopped attending meetings in October
of 2011 because I just could not keep repeating that same crap over and over.  Each
time I 'shared' it felt empty and did not ring true any more.
<p>
I am so glad that I was able to step away from it all and even more glad that
nobody pursued me to ask why I left.  No one even called me for almost a year!  So
go the great friendships of the program.  I guess I had a lot of acquaintances who
I thought were my friends.
<p>
Your web site has really been an eye opener for me about the cult called AA.  I have
been reading other web sites and came across this one describing the 13th step
problem in AA =&gt;
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231100/http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-13th-step" target="_blank">
http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-13th-step</a>
<p>
It sure is a nightmare that the justice system (if you can actually call it that)
sentences many fairly normal people to AA and exposes them to the unbelievable
collection of criminals and sociopaths that attend meetings.  I am sure glad that I
did not ever become a victim in these meetings to the hustling and scheming members.
However I always viewed the people there with a lot of caution, and I did not leave
my critical thinking skills 'at the door'.   Somehow I could never believe folks who
said that they were instantly transformed to become so wonderful when they would
describe their seedy past lives during their 'shares'.
<p>
Keep up the great work on the web site, and thanks for helping me to better
understand and deal with the brainwashing that I got from all of those years of
attending meetings.  Life is too short to keep dwelling on the past and to watch the
passing parade of AA failures.

<p>
Best Regards,<br>
Kurt

Hello Kurt,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments, and I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
About the 13th-Stepping movie</a>: Yes, a woman named &quot;Massive&quot; is working on that. She was also
another A.A. oldtimer with a zillion years, who saw through it all one day and quit A.A.,
and now she's trying to tell the world about it. She needs more money to complete the movie,
so if anyone can chip in a few bucks, please do.
<p> 
This forum thread is relevant, too:<br>
AA meetings in print, the September 2013 AA Grapevine admitting that 13 year olds
are being stalked in meetings with &quot;Unacceptable&quot; and joking about using
Ouija Boards to write the 12&amp;12 in 2011</a>

<p>
I agree that sentencing people to A.A. is a nightmare. It's bad enough that it is illegal
and unConstitutional to sentence people to a religion, but to send youths into the Devil's Den
where they can be sexually exploited is inexcusable.
Judges should be impeached and disbarred for doing that.
<p>
Sending youths to A.A. and N.A. meetings is actually counter-productive.
The youths get a higher education in drugs and alcohol from going to A.A. and N.A.
meetings. The hardened old reprobates teach the youths all kinds of things that the kids didn't
know about drugs and alcohol.  Many of the youths didn't even know about all of the hard
drugs that are available until the oldtimers taught them the ways of the world, and introduced
them to the &quot;grown-up&quot; stuff.
And that is really to be expected, when the judges and parole officers are routinely sending hardened
old criminals to A.A. as part of their parole. The criminals don't always suddenly get holy; they
often pull others down to their level.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hey.

<p>
My username is Bumr50 and just wanted to drop by and leave some commentary
from a Catholic who can't stand AA.

<p>
For reals.

<p>
Even if you don't get to this, I just wanted to let you know that I
appreciate the effort.

<p>
You're objective, and don't bash either religious adherents OR atheists
which I've found to be a problem when trying to find discussion sites about
how ridiculous AA is, and how attending AA meetings (for me) is one of the
surest ways to depress me and send me on a bender.

<p>
Cheers!

Hello Jim,
<p>
You are in. Welcome.
<p>
Thank you for the compliments. I try to be fair and even-handed on the subject of religion.
I am neither an agnostic nor an atheist. More like a bit of a mystic. I know that there is
more to this Universe than meets the eye. As Baba Ram Dass put it, &quot;The physical universe
is only a tiny part of the Cosmos.&quot;

<p>
At the same time, I like atheists because they are almost always far more truthful
and realistic than the crazy cult true believers who drank the koolaid.

<p>
Ah, how to walk that fine line inbetween? It reminds me of the old Zen stories about the difficulty
of rolling a sewing needle down a thread. 
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>

<p>
And all this time we've been blaming ourselves.

<p>
Ever walk into a room with some purpose in mind, only to completely forget what that
purpose was?

<p>
Turns out, doors themselves are to blame for these strange memory lapses.
Psychologists at the University of Notre Dame have discovered that passing through a
doorway triggers what's known as an Event Boundary in the mind, separating one set
of thoughts and memories from the next. Your brain files away the thoughts you had
in the previous room and prepares a blank slate for the new locale.

<p>
Thank goodness for studies like this. It's not our age, it's that damn door!
<p>
Did I send this to you already?

Hello again, Ctmjon,

Truth is that AA works for me. And I am unwilling to risk another way.  Life
is really good.

<p>
I did find the site informative and eye opening, and it does make me think.
In many places it is exactly correct.  There is a schizophrenia about the
disease concept, about character defects, etc.  I think as the program
matures these things will smooth out.  It is a human enterprise, and humans
are fallible.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jonathan,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
About the &quot;schizophrenia&quot;, I think those things are actually places where the A.A. dogma
contradicts itself. And alas, A.A. has already &quot;matured&quot;. The growth period is over and
A.A. is shrinking now. So I don't believe that those problems will ever get fixed.
A.A. will simply fade away, and will be replaced by other things.
<p>
But you will be okay. You don't really need A.A.  telling you that you are
diseased and cannot ever recover. It sounds like you have actually
already recovered.
<p>
Have a good day now.
