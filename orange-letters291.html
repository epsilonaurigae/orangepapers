Hello,

<p>
I woke up this morning and accidentally stumbled across your page.  It's great to
know SOMEONE out there see's NA/AA the same way I do.  I've been to rehab, I've done
the NA thing.... none of it worked.  I didn't quit heroin until I wanted to quit.
And, by that time I didn't need any 12 step none sense to save me from myself.

<p>
Do you write all of the articles, or do you accept user submitted articles?

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hello Christopher,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. And I'm glad to hear that you
quit your bad habits. Welcome to health.

<p>
I have written almost all of the articles, but I'm open to contributions
by others. Feel free to send something.

<p>
And in a way, lots of the letters that I've posted are articles by
others.

<p>
Have a good day now.

At a closed meeting of AA, I was asked what my topic would be and I suggested what

Subject:  	First Amendment rights regarding AA and its traditions and what's really going on there...<br>

<p>
Hi blogging friends,

<p>
sorry for the long email but...

<p>
In quiet thought ...meditation... today it dawned on me that when AA sends their
letter asking all media outlets to not print the truth about AA members stories,
using its 12 traditions as its weapon, it is actually against  the First Amendment
(freedom of Speech.) Yes? ...it's also not fraud ... how they represent AA on
their website... and negligence to not warn the public at large and the AA
membership as a whole about 3rd level sex offenders and violent criminals are being
sentenced to AA unknown to most of the 12 step population and certainly not known to
the general public... right?

<p>
Board Members have a legal liability and responsibility to its members. I recently
learned this at the Screen Actors Guild forum where members just sued the Guild
itself for not including a &quot;minority report&quot; to its members.

<p>
I believe we must have a strategy in how we effect the change we are all looking for.
I know that Isle and Mark are really not activists like some of us are and that
Carolyn needs a break from it all, but I know that you have emails from other
bloggers who are still working underground.

<p>
What Isle and Mark did with ST was the beginning of a huge movement and personally
really helped me leave AA. OP opened my eyes but with the live blogging on ST it was<br>
...<br>
well... really powerful!! Carolyn brought me the first story of a large scale with
harassment &quot;inside &quot; the meeting. And she was the first in AA to really take them
all on legally ie her church.
Her passion and fierceness made me drive 6 hours to meet and interview her.

<p>
Although I knew many other women personally, harassed in the rooms, none of them
were really ready to sue AA Headquarters and leave AA.

<p>
So Any thoughts on this? I am finally moved in and only have 2 boxes of mine to
empty in my new house with a friggen office !!! I have SPACE!!!! :)

<p>
I am now ready to get back to making my film. Just like a few other Docs I have
seen, this work, my Documentary and the activism  go hand and hand.

<p>
EVEN though I myself am willing to sue AA in NY on any ground legally possible, I
have been guided to make my film first by the guy who worked
on &quot;DELIVER US FROM EVIL &quot; a film about the Catholic Church Sex scandal.

<p>
To sue AA and make my film would be too hard. I agree...I can see their point and I
agree for now.

<p>
But someone else can do it.  And if no one does it by the time my film is done...I
can do it. Richardson vs Alcoholics Anonymous has a  nice ring to it. :)

<p>
There is a lawyer up in Washington State who is handling the case where the women
got stabbed in the Anger Management class.
That story Anti D posted on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709131745/http://www.nadaytona.com/" target="_blank">www.nadaytona.com</a>
site. I contacted him and he said he was willing to help.

<p>
Isle and Mark... there were many super intelligent bloggers on ST and I hope if you
know any that might want to be in direct contact with me please have them call and/or
 email me.

<p>
I think one is a lawyer. Mona Lisa? But I don't remember her real name.

<p>
Again I want to thank each and every one of you that has helped me leave AA and in
turn you have helped me and my son age 21,  from going down the path of the cult.

<p>
Thats all for now. Have a lovely Sunday!<br>
peace

Hello Monica,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all that you do. Making the movie sounds like a very good thing
to do. Our society is so visually-oriented that ideas just don't penetrate the skulls of
a lot of people if they don't see it on TV or in a movie.

<p>
(I am reminded of the movie <i>Dogma</i>. I was just watching that again for amusement.
In it, &quot;The Metatron&quot; complained that people were oblivious to all kinds of religious concepts,
and all that he got was blank stares when he talked about such things,
but as soon as somebody puts it in a Charlton Heston movie, everybody becomes a theologian.)
<p>
I'm not a lawyer, so I can't sue. At times, I wish I was. I know that at least one or two readers
are lawyers. Perhaps they will connect with a good test case. Getting just the right case that is
really worth pursuing is a challenge. Like you say, a lot of people are not ready to sue.
I've heard the same thing. People who have a great case of coerced religion say that they just want
to get through it and put it behind them. Such a precedent-setting case requires both an iron-clad
case and a plaintiff who is totally committed and ready to fight to the death, and a lawyer or somebody
who is willing to gamble a lot of money.
Oh, and we need a lawyer who does that kind of lawsuits. The one lawyer that I remember writing in is
<a href="orange-letters162.html#BillWill2" target="newwin729">Claire, who is an estate attorney who deals
with wills and inheritances</a>.


<p>
Still, I can hope.
<p>
By the way, did anyone hear what happened with Baldwin Research? They were suing A.A. for defamation of character.
(And just to really complicate matters, later, I heard that Baldwin Research is a Scientology front.
I'm not sure, but that's what I hear. It seems that they share an 800 phone number with other Scientology
fronts.
Nevertheless, watching Scientology and A.A. sue each other could be very entertaining in a primitive sort
of way, kind of like putting a scorpion and a black widow spider in a jar and watching them fight it out.)

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Friendlyofella,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, facts. That is what it's all about.
<p>
Like the fact that when Dr. George Vaillant, who loves A.A. so much that he became a member of
the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous, shoved A.A. on his patients for many, many years,
the result was the A.A. didn't work at all, and just raised the death rate.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
Now that wasn't a debate, that was just the doctor issuing a report declaring what happened.
<p>
Yes, facts. Here are many more facts:
<a href="orange-letters272.html#results" target="_blank">Results of doctors' clinical tests of A.A.</a>
<p>
Yes, facts. Heaven knows, we don't want to bet our lives on the ravings of some nutcases who
just ignore the facts and yammer about how wonderful their religious beliefs are.

From:  	&quot;Tom H.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	The most difficult Aspect of the AA Program<br>

<p>
The real question is whether A.A. does more harm than good.  There sure does seem to
be a lot of us long time sobriety people around that claim it took many of us ten
times or more at treatment or A.A. to &quot;get the program.&quot;   The higher power in AA
must place special favors on the average 48-52 year old alcoholic when this higher
power grants them sobriety.  (That's the average age of getting sober)
<p>
I have come to my own personal conclusions that a person like myself came into AA a
serious problem drinker and got sober 13 years later as a full blown low bottom
alcoholic.  I could be out of my gourd but I think AA keeps people drinking until
they literally cannot drink anymore.  Then they take the credit.  Why don't we have
large groups of late twenty year old sobriety members sitting around the tables ?
<p>
We quit when we cannot any longer drink or we will die.  Some choose to drink to
death and that in itself is another whole subject.
<p>
Tom

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I have to agree with every one of your points.
<p>
I also drank until I just could not drink any more. The doctor said, &quot;Quit
drinking or die. Choose one.&quot; And he meant it. And I was so sick that I believed him.
After thinking about it for a while, and drinking on it some more, and thinking
some more, I finally decided to quit.  And I did.
<p>
My quitting had nothing to do with A.A. or treatment or anything like that. It had everything to do with being
very, very sick.

<p>
Doctors and professionals like to use the phrase &quot;maturing out of addictive
behavior&quot;. That often strikes me as a fancy way of saying, &quot;Burning out.&quot;
When you just can't do it any more, you can't do it any more, and you either quit drinking or die.
<p>
I'm glad that we both chose to live. Have a good day now.

Subject:<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
A.A. Cultwatch here in the U.K. is disputing A.A. membership which is put at 34000.
It thinks that ex-members should be included in the current membership.
<p>
By this thinking I ought to be counted as a drinker although I am 17 years sober.
<p>
What is the name for this type of thinking?

<p>
Hugh G

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Hugh,
<p>
Wow. Thanks for the letter. That kind of thinking strikes me as desperation. They must
really be desperate to make A.A. look bigger and better than it is.
<p>
I'm not sure about the proper name for such thinking. These labels come to mind: Crazy,
wishful thinking, <i>non sequitur</i>, deluded, demented, irrational, nuts...
<p>
And I would guess that they are imagining that everybody who left A.A. is not only wonderfully sober,
but <i>sober because of A.A. practices</i> that they learned while they were in A.A.
(So of course all of those ex-members should be counted as A.A. success stories.)
That is outrageously unrealistic and delusional.
And there is a word for that kind of thinking: presumptuous. They presume that ex-members are sober, and
that A.A. is due the credit for that imagined sobriety.

<p>
Such an attitude also directly contradicts the idea that you cannot ever leave A.A.,
and you can't ever graduate, and you must remain in A.A. forever, faithfully
attending the meetings and teaching the young and being an inspiration to the beginners, or
else you will relapse.

<p>
I am also surprised at the number. Is that it? Only 34,000 A.A. members
in all of the U.K.? That is really tiny. No wonder they want to inflate the number.
<p>
If the U.K. version of &quot;AAcultwatch&quot; is the same as the USA version, then they
are a bunch of A.A. true believers who want to get rid of the cultish &quot;improper behavior&quot;
in A.A. that is &quot;not following the Traditions&quot; and making A.A. &quot;look bad&quot;.
They imagine that all of the bad things about A.A. are just the result of &quot;a few bad apples&quot;, and
that A.A. will be wonderful if people just follow the rules and Traditions properly,
&quot;like they did in Good Old Days&quot;.
<p>
I find them to be a very interesting bunch, and occasionally, I learn about some really scandalous
things in A.A. from them. Still, I think they are really confused about what constitutes honesty
and spirituality.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Once again, it becomes obvious that I have a raccoon living in the back yard. Welcome to the country.
I had not seen his footprints since the previous winter when he left his footprints in the snow then.
I wasn't sure if he was still around. He is.
He has been helping himself to any remaining oatmeal or bread or other birdfood that is left laying around

Dear Orange &#8212; 
<p>
You have no idea how grateful I am that you did the recon for this.  Please
read my story &#8212; the rehab to which I refer uses A.A. maliciously and only
now, retrospectively, do I understand what it was all about.  I had to
figure it out on my own because only years after the fact, did I stumble
across your article; but I had to really look for it using specific key
words.  This problem is so under covered it's virtually never been covered
at all.  It scares the shit out of me.  Below you may find the icing to
your cake.  The irony is that the answers and evidence have always been
there, but  it's erased by the media with Whitney Houston/Amy Whinehouse
stories that twist celebrity overdoses to propagate the political agenda.
The rabbit hole goes so far down that it feels impossible to overcome the
adamance of a conditioned society.

<p>
All the best,<br>

In 2006, I lost everything I'd ever worked for to appease the U.S. and New
Jersey &#8212; everyone except myself.  The municipal court charged me using
local laws for misdemeanor possession of Cannabis (actually a civil
violation).  My lawyer assured me the charges would be dropped if I bit the
bullet and allowed myself to be *rehabilitated* for this civil disobedience;
even though the &quot;criminal&quot; event for which I was charged never even
orbitted the criteria for addiction.  I spent over a year in a
fundamentalist rehab in Prescott, AZ that aggressively and abusively
indoctrinated clients by making them dependent on them as an institution
for every basic staple of life &#8212; shelter, food, social affirmation, etc.
But this &quot;assistance&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; came with clear strings attached,
which required me to always submit beneath the Prescott House because A.A.
provided the only known &quot;cure&quot; for my &quot;disease.&quot;

<p>
As a condition for community citizenship and acceptance, I had to send
everything I owned and had earned to my parents, rendering me immediately
dependent on their system. Administrators then contacted my family and
manipulated them with hysteria (a crises of panic).  But I never saw that
injustice coming until it had already oppressed me; I never fathomed that
my own family could be so easily startled into an irrational panic &#8212; one
that drove them to shatter my civil and constitutional rights without rhyme
or reason and so self-righteously.  Ultimately, my parents broke laws that
were so much more serious than the single one I broke with my choice to
blaze a little weed (gasp!).  They did so because they were told (and
blindly accepted) that I simply had to &#8212; that there was no other way.  12
step meeting attendance (&quot;the program&quot;) is widely used by courts to
indoctrinate beliefs, which theoretically, leads to behavioral change
(*Behavioral Modification Therapy*). Their prerogative was that this somehow protected
me from myself.

<p>
But I was never a stranger to myself nor did I bother anyone
other than the governemnt who simply imposed their disagreement upon me.  I
knew this was fundamentally unethical, but had no idea why.  Periodically
throughout my tenure clients arrived then immediately left before &quot;the
house&quot; confiscated their democratic freedom.  My brothers and I had to earn
our way (&quot;graduate&quot;) from &quot;the house&quot; which could only be approved by
administrators without any of my input.  This took as long as &quot;house&quot;
politico wanted to detain me and I was never, at any time, explained why I
was still there; I was forbidden to sit in on their &quot;special lunches&quot; in
which they convened to discuss clients' progress.  Some of my brothers
actually endured this because they had allowed themselves to be convinced
it would save them.  The only reason I stayed was to get my ass out of
legal trouble.

<p>
But many of my fellow compatriots really were addicts who could not
restrain themselves from compulsively using substances.  When the system
decided to expel them from the house community (without explanation), they
had nothing but drugs to once again console their loss.   Their families
disowned them &#8212; and the house citizenship was legally obliged to never
again interact with them in any way; unless they desired the same fate.
Several left and overdosed &#8212; and when we requested to attend the funerals,
were denied our right to do so.  Leo, one of my closest comrades at the
house, spent his final days with Hep. C. in this mental prison getting his
buttons pushed.  Finally, after over a year of that torture, Leo went into
self-preservation mode and rightfully spoke out to protect his last days.

<p>
Without rhyme or reason, the system disowned Leo and he spent the last
month or so of his life in miserable pain.  He died alone living
effectively in exile &#8212; confined by physical discomfort and shame to a piece
of shit motel room on mainstreet Prescott.  His window overlooked the town
square in the heart of Prescott: the commons.  The Prescott House didn't
blink an eye nor did it even remotely insinuate foul play.  The House and
its oligarchy shamelessly and unapologetically forced someone dying to
unjustly suffer for what the medical community considers an &quot;illness.&quot;
This is inherently immoral and it proves why establishments like the U.N.,
U.S. government, and the P- House evade prosecution for implicating
themselves in murder.  Anyone who consults the content of legislation that
permits this would know immediately how that was allowed to happen.
Excessive ambiguity in domestic and international laws permit the
selective application of conventions and doctrines. Believe it or not &#8212; 
social justice theory can be made to justify injustice when if government
ignores everyone who disagrees with it; enough so to argue and re-engineer
social justice to harm Leo and me.

<p>
Only in retrospect, do I now understand the Prescott House was (and
is) an idea that doesn't suddenly &quot;go away&quot; when clients walk off the
property.  If you don't believe me, pick up the APA's DSM-IV diagnostic
manual and see for yourself what it says about addiction.  The last time I
recently consulted it, the medical community still considers it the only
&quot;known&quot; treatment for substance abuse (and use).  Unforutnately, this isn't
the case &#8212; the medical community itself refuses to abandon its reliance on
A.A.; even though pharamecutically engineered medications have much greater
success rates than the program.  The House shares a personal relationship
with Prescott PD, which allows it to continue to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; people who
disagree with its ideology.  Like the U.S. government, it twists and
distorts &quot;social justice&quot; &#8212; this doesn't mean social justice can't be just
 &#8212; it usually is.  But with that said, my &quot;rehab experience&quot; invariably
escalated my distress and even played a role in deliberately orchestrating
a situation that led multiple clients to their deaths.  All the &quot;house&quot; had
to do was point and command them to continue on down an already perilous
path.  This is exactly why the courts shut down &quot;scared straight&quot; in the
90's.  But it proves we must always ask why &#8212; even when we're not supposed
to.

Are you crazy? Maybe AA does not help everyone but it does help
some. I am a member of NA so I guess you probably come to the same conclusion
about us. I have a life NA taught me to look at myself I am not dependent on
NA. I came to NA out of prison, a high school drop out and divorced after being
married at age 15. Today I hold a Masters Degree, I have a career and a beautiful
family. Before I became clean I tried psychiatry, many
treatment centers, and other programs. I have been clean 19 years, I have a
career, I have a family and I am clean because of a relationship with God and
good friends in NA who supported me. NA is not my life it is a tool. I agree 12
step programs are not for everyone but I am ok with whatever it takes to get
clean. I wonder how many people died because of this article?

Hello Mary,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations for getting a grip and quitting your bad habits.
And congratulations for making something of your life after you quit doping and got out of prison.
<p>
You try to imply that somehow Narcotics Anonymous got you your Master's Degree. I doubt that.
Did they take your exams for you?
<p>
You also try to imply that N.A. &quot;worked&quot; when other things like psychiatry did not work.
(I have no doubts that the treatment centers did not work. They are just 12-Step cult indoctrination centers.)
You are overlooking the fact that maturing out of addictive behavior takes time, and people tend to
give the credit to whatever they were doing when they finally quit drinking or doping.
The essence of finally quitting forever is just learning that you cannot indulge even a little bit
or you will go back down that slippery slope again. (I know, I speak from experience.)
Whether you go to some meetings at the time that you learn that is irrelevant.

<p>
<a name="results"> </a>
What you call &quot;helping some&quot; isn't good enough.
I'm sure that A.A. and N.A. do &quot;help some&quot;. That is, they give a little moral support and encouragement
to some people who are wavering. And they give some companionship. <b>BUT</b> both A.A. and N.A.
kill more people than they help. The false teachings like that you are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;,
and &quot;powerless over our addiction&quot; hurt more people than they help. Then there is the guilt-inducing
confession routine that is passed off as spirituality.
Just foisting an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties on sick people is not &quot;helping them&quot;.
Nor does such a cult religion cause good things.

<p>
That has been verified again and again.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who loves A.A. so much that he became a member of the A.A. Board of Trustees,
shoved A.A. treatment on alcoholics for many many years, and he tracked his first 100 patients for
eight years. At the end of the eight years, the score was 5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
Five &quot;helped&quot; and 29 dead. I don't call that help. (Then consider that 5 out of a hundred is the normal
rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics  &#8212;  that is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">how many will quit each year all on their own</a>,
without any A.A. &quot;help&quot; or treatment.)

<p><li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana C. Walsh</a>
found that A.A. treatment made alcoholics require more expensive hospitalization.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. caused alcoholics to go on much worse binges.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman</a>
found that A.A. increased the rate of rearrests.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a>
found that just having a doctor talk to an alcoholic and his wife for one hour, telling him that
he must quit drinking or he will die, was just as effective as a whole year of A.A.-based treatment.

<p><li>
Then my own experience at N.A. meetings was: At the start of every meeting, the group secretary asks,
&quot;Can we see a show of hands of people who have a year or more clean and sober to show that this program
works?&quot; And about 3 hands out of 50 go up.  On a good night, they might get 5 out of 75.
(That was the Burnside Blues meeting in downtown Portland, OR.)
<p>
Note that the group secretary never asked, &quot;Can we see a show of hands of people
who have a year or more clean and sober without doing the 12-Step routine to show
that heretical cult religion is completely unnecessary for clean and sober living?&quot;

<p>
That's when I would have raised my hand.

</ol>
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello again, Hetu-Ahin,
<p>
That document is a good example of 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#pseudo_intellectual" target="_blank"><i>Pseudo-intellectual Bull</i></a>.
That style of propaganda appears to be very scholarly, but it is really a mess of confusing language,
misleading statements, and citations of other untrue propaganda articles.
<p>
Take these lines from the first page, for example:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Millions of individuals are current members in more than
180 countries, and more than 28 million AA &quot;Big Books&quot; (the main AA text) have sold
making it one of the highest selling non-fiction books of all time (Humphreys 2004; AA
2008; Kelly and Yeterian 2008).
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is the propaganda trick called
<a href="&quot;#appeal2numbers&quot;">Appeal to Numbers (<i>Argumentum ad Numerum</i>)</a>
&#8212; just bandy about big numbers and try to fool the local yokels into thinking
that this must be a good thing because the numbers are so big.

<p>
The &quot;Millions&quot; number is a lie, pure and simple. Alcoholics Anonymous does not
have even 2 million members in the entire world, never mind 2 million sober members.<br>
(Look here:
<a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters216.html#churn</a>)<br>

And who cares how many copies of the <i>Big Book</i> have been sold?<br>
Scientology also sells lots of books, and they also brag about how many books they sell.
They brag that Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, is one of the best-selling authors
in the world.<br>
Does that make Scientology a great force for sanity in this world?<br>
Does that mean that you should give your mind and your money to Scientology?<br>
<p>
Need I even mention that facts that Adolf Hitler's <i>Mein Kampf</i> and Karl Marx's <i>Communist Manifesto</i>
were also big hits that sold millions of copies?

<p>
Notice the reference to Humphries.
When they start citing Humphries and Moos, you know that you are reading deceptive A.A. promotional literature.
Look here for more about those propagandists:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="newwin32">Keith Humphries' and Rudolf Moos' propaganda</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="_blank">the pathetic Moos and Humphries propaganda</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters31.html#Moos3" target="newwin39">more Moos</a>

</ol>
<p>
The authors also cited Project MATCH repeatedly, which was a failed experiment that produced muddled
results where nothing appeared to work any better than anything else, and they had no control group so
they could not show that any treatment program worked any better than no treatment. We discussed that before,
just recently,
<a href="orange-letters289.html#iamnotastatistic" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
The very first line of the article is a lie:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Rigorous reviews of the science on the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) indicate that AA
and related 12-step treatment are at least as helpful as other intervention approaches.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is not true at all. Careful controlled studies of A.A. have shown that A.A. kills, and there has
never been a controlled study that showed that A.A. worked.
Rather, the evidence says that exposure to A.A. teachings and practices has a negative influence, and
makes sick people worse, and even elevates the death rate.
I just wrote that out again, in a previous letter, just a few minutes ago,
so I'll point you to it,
<a href="orange-letters291.html#results" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
So what &quot;science&quot; did they &quot;rigorously review&quot;? More propaganda articles from other A.A. boosters?
Yes, that is exactly what they did. That is not science.
Science is doing carefully controlled experiments to see what reality has to teach us.

<p>
The next line is equally untrue:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Exactly how AA
achieves these beneficial outcomes is less well understood, yet, greater elucidation of AA's mechanisms
could inform our understanding of addiction recovery and the timing and content of alcohol-related
interventions.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
They are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii">assuming facts not in evidence</a>.
A.A. does not produce &quot;beneficial outcomes&quot;. Then, the jabber about
&quot;greater elucidation of AA's mechanisms&quot; is more high-falutin' B.S.  If they want to understand how
A.A. works, they can consult any good text on brainwashing and cult indoctrination.
<p>
Heck, they can even try reading
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test, and Alcoholics Anonymous as a Cult</a>.
They will learn a lot about how A.A. works from that.
I notice that was not listed in the bibliography. They could have listed it &#8212; they did their
paper in 2009, and the Cult Test has existed since 2001. Surely they didn't miss that in their &quot;rigorous&quot;
search of the literature.

<p>
Down on page 5 they start actually considering the success rate of A.A. treatment, and what do they
rely on? The faked studies by Moos and Humphries. I've already analyzed their so-called studies
and found them to be a frauds. (See links above.)
Moos and Humphries twist the facts and distort the numbers to make
it look like A.A. works, and they have been doing that for many, many years.
<p>
And that is not just my opinion. I was just rereading an article by
the <i>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i> that criticized previous pro-A.A. articles
&#8212; articles that claimed good results for A.A., and that claimed that A.A. was better than
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)  &#8212;
for many failings like bad math, no control group, mixed teachings (teaching 12-Step superstitions in
CBT courses), cherry picking, self-reporting (the subjects lied when they said they were sober),
and unrealistic environments. See:
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank">orange-letters247.html#Clark_M</a>
<p>
And the <i>International Journal</i> very specifically repeatedly criticized Moos
for his faulty studies that had no controls:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Claims for effectiveness of the 12-Step intervention continue to be based on studies
lacking a no-treatment control (e.g., Moos, 2003).  Currently, assessment of
(e.g. Marlatt, Witkiewitz, Dillworth, Bowen, Parks, Macpherson, Lonczak, Larimer,
Simpson, Blume, &amp; Crutcher, 2004) and claims of effectiveness for (e.g.  Moos, 2003;
Moos, Finney, Ouimette, &amp; Suchinsky, 1999; Morgenstern, Blanchard, Morgan,
Labouvie &amp; Hayaki, 2001) 12-Step interventions rely on a group of published
reports generated from a study of patients who entered U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) substance abuse treatment programs and participated in a multisite
study. Although as in other studies of 12-step interventions there was no control
for comparison to no treatment, a number of features (Moos et al., 1999) establish
the study as the most powerful evaluation to date of effectiveness of 12-Step based
intervention for substance abuse: large (intake n = 3699) sample size, replication
across 15 sites, and a naturalistic design drawing data from real clinical settings. 
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, results and conclusions reported from this study are
re-evaluated based on a critical analysis of design, methodology and construction
of outcome measures using published reports (Finney, Noyes, Coutts, &amp; Moos, 1998;
Ouimette, Finney &amp; Moos, 1997; Ouimette, Moos, &amp; Finney, 1998) along with
clarifying information and assessment instruments provided by the researchers
(R.H. Moos, personal communication).<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then the
<i>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i>
proceeded to rip apart that influential Moos study, and show it to be completely invalid, just a fraud.
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank">Read that article</a>.
It's worth reading.

<p>
So this paper that assumes that A.A. works and produces &quot;beneficial outcomes&quot;
is actually based on faked tests that are full of misinformation, bad practices,
bad numbers, and bad logic.
That is really just standard operating procedure for the 12-Step propaganda industry.
That is why A.A. is a cult, not a cure.
<p>
Remember that the &quot;recovery industry&quot; or &quot;rehab business&quot; is
a $20 billion per year scam, just in the USA.
(Heaven only knows how much it adds up to in the rest of the world.) The salesmen of
that quackery will tell a lot of lies for $20 billion.

<p>
You should find this line from the <i>International Journal</i> particularly interesting,
since you claim to be an atheist and should like rational thinking:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Completion of the first six steps inculcates subjects in the 12-Step concepts of powerlessness, moral culpability, and the external efficacy of a magical power or force, all concepts external to cognitive-behavioral therapy.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, A.A. teachings are the opposite of any kind of rational recovery.

<p>

Then this Kelly, et. al., paper just goes on and on, singing the praises of A.A.,
all based on the fraudulent papers of Moos and Humphries and Humphries and Moos:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Compelling evidence for the cost-benefit effects of 12-step approaches to treatment
has also been shown. A large multi-site study of US Veterans Administration (VA)
intensive treatment programs compared the 1-year outcomes of patients treated in
either intensive CBT or 12-step treatment. Those treated in 12-step treatment settings
had substantially greater 12-step group participation than patients treated in CBT
programs, who received twice the number of outpatient visits and significantly more
inpatient mental health days. This difference in professional service utilization resulted
in 64% higher annual costs for CBT than for 12-step programs. Notably, the
demographic and clinical characteristics of patients across the two types of programs at
intake were comparable. The outcomes were comparable also, except that patients
treated in 12-step programs had higher rates of abstinence (46% vs. 36%; Humphreys
and Moos 2001).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A 2-year follow-up of the multi-site VA sample (Humphreys and Moos 2007) found
a substantially higher abstinence rate among patients treated in 12-step (50%) compared to
CBT (37%) programs. Again, patients from 12-step programs were more AA-involved than
CBT patients, while CBT patients relied more on outpatient and inpatient mental health
services. This resulted in 30% lower costs for those treated in 12-step programs (savings of
$2440 per patient) while achieving significantly better abstinence rates. These results were
consistent with earlier findings in a non-VA sample that showed 45% lower treatment costs
over a 3-year period for AA attendees compared to those electing outpatient care
(Humphreys and Moos 1996).
<br>

<p>
I could continue, ripping apart every paragraph of this paper, but what's the point?

<p>
However, there are a few more interesting points to mention:

Down on the sixth page, they say,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<h2>How does AA help individuals recover from alcohol dependence?</h2>
<p>
Contrary to AA's language and somewhat mystical terminology documented in its main
texts (AA 1939, 1953, 2001) one might argue that its mechanisms could be explained by
ordinary means, such as through common processes of change (e.g., by increasing and/or
maintaining motivation, self-efficacy, and coping skills). With equal validity, one might
argue that AA works through practices specific to AA (e.g., working the 12-steps) or by
providing access to a low-risk social network. It may be through some combination, all, or
none of the above. In this section, we attempt to clarify how AA works by first describing
AA's own proposed mechanisms, and then by summarizing the empirical literature
regarding what is currently known about how AA may exert its effects.

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
They almost make sense there, except that they are trying to argue that the A.A. magical, mystical
practices actually work, which they don't. Again, the cornerstone
of their entire paper is the mistaken assumption that Moos and Humphries told the truth about
the A.A. recovery rate, which they didn't do. So this entire paper is much ado about nothing.

<p>
Still, these authors then become more entertaining as they tap-dance around the concepts of magical healing,
and try to dress up such superstition in the trappings of academia:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h2>How change occurs from AA's own perspective</h2>
<p>
Given that AA grew out of a religio-spiritual tradition rather than an academic or scientific
one, a coherent or consistent description of AA's purported mechanisms can be difficult to
grasp from its main texts (AA 1939, 1953). Some change mechanisms (i.e., the 12-steps)
and their effects are made clear: &quot;The fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had
deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward
life, toward our fellows, and toward God's universe&quot; (AA 2001, p. 25).
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the other hand,
the social and fellowship aspects inherent in group meetings are more implicit in much of
AA's writings, especially those in the Big Book (1939). This may be because the fellowship
was largely non-existent at the time this book was written and published (with less than 100
members across two states, Ohio and New York; AA 2001) and the original main text body
has not been changed, apart from forewords to each subsequent edition (AA 2001).
However, we believe it is safe to say that AA facilitates change via two broadly defined
components: the AA &quot;program&quot;, exemplified in the 12 steps, and the AA &quot;fellowship&quot;,
characterized by the network of formal and informal social gatherings and communications
between meetings.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The central proposed mechanism of recovery from alcohol addiction according to AA
is through a &quot;psychic change&quot; (AA 2001, p. xxvi), &quot;spiritual experience&quot;, or &quot;spiritual
awakening&quot; (AA 2001, Appendix II) achieved through completion of the 12-step program
(as noted in Step 12: &quot;Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps . . .&quot;).
A measurable definition of a spiritual &quot;experience&quot; or &quot;awakening&quot; has eluded many
(Galanter 2007b). Although AA states that this &quot;awakening&quot; can take the form of a sudden
shift in belief and perspective, it also characterizes this transformation as a gradual change of
an &quot;educational variety&quot; that leads to &quot;. . . a profound alteration in [his] reaction to life&quot; (AA
2001, Appendix II). This is not only associated with belief in a &quot;higher power&quot;, but also
involves concrete changes in specific attitudes and behaviors. Alcohol treatment researchers
have subsequently proposed that some of these attitudinal or behavioral shifts may be
consistent with those mobilized in other behaviorally-oriented treatments (McCrady 1994).
Thus, although the language and concepts may differ on the surface, underneath the same
ultimate (common) processes may be operating. Therefore, AA identifies internal cognitive-
affective and spiritual changes arising out of engagement in AA-prescribed behaviors, and,
as will be explored in more detail shortly, varying alcohol researchers have alternately
considered these purported mechanisms as AA-specific and as common factors of behavior
change.
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Although often implicit in AA's own writings on how AA conveys its beneficial effects,
another major feature of Alcoholics Anonymous is the social or &quot;fellowship&quot; dimension.

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, all of the observed mental changes can be explained by
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#brainwashing" target="_blank">a few good textbooks about brainwashing</a>
 and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Appel" target="_blank">cult indoctrination</a>.
And
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#DSM" target="_blank"><i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i></a>
(DSM-III or DSM-IV) also comes in handy.
<p>
And again, all of this jabber about &quot;change&quot; is based on the mistaken assumption that A.A. makes some
good changes, which the authors get from fraudulent papers that declare that A.A. is a success when it isn't.

Subject:  	A little discussion<br>

<p>
Something about that old Vaillant study is that the cohorts weren't matched.<br>
It's not unreasonable to suppose a lot of the people going into aa are those that
have tried to quit by themselves first, and/or had their consultation with a doctor,
and/or of had other forms of intervention.<br>
Given that, having roughly comparable abstinence/social drinking outcomes looks very
good for aa.<br>
What percentage of serious hardcore chronic alcoholics spontaneously recover? Zero?

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, no, no. You have been listening to A.A. propaganda &#8212; their story that you
will die without the cult. What the doctors and medical schools say
is that about 50% of all alcoholics and addicts finally quit their self-destructive behavior,
and most of the successful quitters do it alone, on their own.
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health says that 75% of the
successful quitters do it alone.
The Harvard Medical School says that 80% of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year or more do it alone,
on their own.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">Look here for the rest of the story</a>.

<p>
I don't follow your logic about the Vaillant study. No matter what the treatment is, or what the recovery
group is, a lot of the patients will have had previous experiences with quitting and relapsing, or trying
to quit, and failing. That is just normal, and doesn't say anything about any particular treatment modality.
<p>
Dr. Vaillant synthesized his control group from a random sampling of untreated alcoholics. I'm sure
that many of them also had plenty of experience with previous treatment, or A.A., and relapses.
So what cohort was &quot;unmatched&quot;?
</font>
<p>
I also do think that there is a vast difference between being a member of aa &#8212; which
means desiring to stop drinking and saying you're a member of aa, and working the
program. The latter involves a lot &#8212; daily prayer, meditation, inventory, gratitude
list &#8212; and really you're supposed to be doing step 10 all day as well.

<p>
So what percentage of those who work the program get better? Well, maybe a lot more
than 30-40.

<p>
This gives a very different picture from the one you offer.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Do you have any documentation or studies or tests to support that, or are you just guessing?
<p>
The fact remains that exposure to A.A. teachings and practices has
<a href="orange-letters272.html#results" target="_blank">a negative influence, and
makes sick people worse, and even raises the death rate</a>.
<p>
The argument that the drunk people did not &quot;work The Program right&quot; is a standard A.A. dodge, to avoid
admitting that &quot;The Program&quot; has a high failure rate.<br>
<ol>
<li> If someone quits drinking, claim that he worked The Program right, even if he didn't.<br>
<li> If someone does not quit drinking, claim that he didn't work The Program right, even if he did.
</ol>
<p>
There is still zero evidence that &quot;working The Program right&quot; makes
people quit drinking. The evidence is that The Program is better at making people
binge and die.

Subject:  	and a little more<br>

<p>
I don't know to what extent you are right about the founders and the cult element
of aa at certain times and places. I just have no view.

<p>
In London, England, right now it isn't like that.

<p>
Here is what I found

<p>
Meetings: (i) Regular reminder of risk and  gravity of relapse (ii) Learning from
experience of many other alcoholics (iii) Somewhere to go for company instead of
drinking (iv) Unconditional acceptance and friendship (lots of hugs).

<p>
Steps (i) Recognition of one's inability to control drinking (ii) Acceptance of the
need for help (iii) Encouragement of honesty and good behaviour, mandate to make
amends to those we have harmed to deal with guilt, practice dealing with fear.
(iii) Encouragement to develop a realistic view of oneself, avoiding the stress of a
false image, allowing gratitude for desirable qualities (iv) Emotion processing:
bring feelings to consciousness, recognize them share them with others: they
dissipate, or, if not, we accept them as parts of our psyche, learn to live with
them, become their friends (v) Mandate to provide service to others bolstering
self-worth, alleviating low self-esteem. (vi) Meditation to alleviate stress. (v)
Prayer (for theists), good for health.

<p>
Fellowship: a support network to call in case upon in case of crisis.

<p>
Sponsor: with whom to share, from whom to get advice, to call in upon in case of
crisis.

<p>
Serenity: to accept the things we cannot change, so that we don't get wound up.

<p>
Courage: to change the things we can so we gain fulfillment from action instead of a
feeling of uselessness as the fruit of procrastination.

<p>
There is negligible pressure on anyone to do or believe anything. I am an atheist,
so is my sponsor. I did the steps having removed the word 'God' from them. At one
meeting there was a sign up saying 'who are you to say there is no God?'. I asked
that this be taken down. After two meetings and a vote, it was taken down.<br>
Nobody goes around trying to recruit drunks.<br>
Nobody makes any money. Nobody has any status or any opportunity to be revered or
anything like that. Nobody has any means, in the program, to exploit anyone else.
Basically we are just trying to help each other.

<p>
Does anything very different go on the States? I am just asking, out of curiosity,
because I don't know.

<p>
Cheers,

Your rewrite of the 12 Steps is interesting. You have made them into something very different
from the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Removing God from the 12 Steps makes them into an exercise in lunacy. I don't mean to be insulting,
but it is flat-out crazy to imagine that somebody who isn't there will restore you to sanity in Step 2,
and take care of your will and your life for you in Step 3, and remove your defects in Step 7, and
talk to you in a s&eacute;ance in Step 11 and give you work orders and power, and then
 give you a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; or &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; in Step 12.
That is a lot for somebody who doesn't exist to do.

<p>
Now your rewrite of the Steps removes many of those problems by making it sound
more like a secular group therapy session. You should then recognize that you are
not a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, and you are not practicing the A.A. program.
You belong to a different organization, one of your own creation.
You have just appropriated the name &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.

<p>
By the way, yes, A.A. is very crazy in the USA. In spite of their jabber about
Freedom of Religion, you would start a civil war with your secular talk if you
did it in American A.A. meetings. Remove God from the Program? No way in Hell.

<p>
A.A. in the USA is like this:

You should also see
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy I. and his Pacific Group</a>.
Be aware of the fact that they have sent out missionaries, and now have groups in
London and Plymouth, and they are coming for you.
They fully intend to take over A.A., and they might succeed. Then you will see first-hand what I am talking about.
<p>
Oh, and how they do it is: They invade a group in large numbers, so that they can
vote out the current leadership at the next business meeting, and install their
own people. Then they change the rules so that only people who are sponsored by
Clancy or his &quot;spiritual descendents&quot; can vote in future elections &#8212;  that is, only Clancy's
sponsees, grand-sponsees, great-grand-sponsees, and so on. Then they move on to
another group, and take over that one, too. And then another, and another.
Then, when they have taken over the majority of the groups in an area, they take over the area inter-group.
You can see where that leads. They can just work their way up the pyramid until they have taken
over the whole thing.
