Dear Dr. Volkow,

<p>
As a certified Alcohol and other Drug Counselor that shows the HBO &quot;Addiction&quot;
series (in which you have a prominent role!), I need to know the answers to the
following questions which must have been &quot;edited out&quot; of the 2007 series. Mainly,

<p>
1.) What is the definition of a &quot;disease&quot; (a MEDICAL &quot;disease&quot;), as accepted in
medical schools, and by ANY medical doctor?

<p>
2.) How does an &quot;addiction&quot; meet the criteria of a &quot;medical disease&quot; based on how
&quot;medical disease&quot; is defined?

<p>
In the  HBO &quot;Addiction&quot; series, you state that addiction is a &quot;disease of the
brain&quot;, which makes me and my clients genuinely ask, &quot;How do you catch it?&quot; Or is
addiction NOT a disease if the person with one, WILLINGLY, KNOWINGLY, and
VOLUNTARILY engages in the BEHAVIOR (emphasis in CAPITAL LETTERS!) to keep the
addiction going?

<p>
Thank you for your clarification of these inquiries.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
Thank you for your message to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and Dr.
Volkow asking questions about addiction as a disease of the brain.

<p>
According to the National Library of Medicine (NLM) MedlinePlus Medical
Dictionary, disease is defined as &quot;an impairment of the normal state of the living
animal or plant body or one of its parts that interrupts or modifies the
performance of the vital functions, is typically manifested by distinguishing
signs and symptoms, and is a response to environmental factors (as malnutrition,
industrial hazards, or climate), to specific infective agents (as worms, bacteria,
or viruses), to inherent defects of the organism (as genetic anomalies), or to
combinations of these factors.&quot;  Addiction is defined as &quot;compulsive physiological
need for and use of a habit-forming substance (as heroin, nicotine, or alcohol)
characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological symptoms upon
withdrawal; broadly: persistent compulsive use of a substance known by the user to
be physically, psychologically, or socially harmful.&quot;

<p>
Addiction results largely from brain changes that stem from prolonged drug
use?changes that involve multiple brain circuits, including those responsible for
governing self-control and other behaviors.  Addiction is considered a brain
disease because drugs change the brain &#8212;  they change its structure and how it works.
These brain changes can be long lasting, and can lead to the harmful behaviors
seen in people who abuse drugs.

<p>

<p>
I think what BOTH of these &quot;definitions&quot; miss however, is the process of HOW an
addictive chemical substance gets into the human body! NO addictive substance causes
ANY &quot;brain changes&quot; without being INTRODUCED INTO THE BRAIN by the ingestor.
Therefore, an &quot;addict&quot; using any drug would NOT be considered &quot;diseased&quot;, but the
brain would only BECOME &quot;diseased&quot; after &quot;prolonged use&quot; (which is??).

<p>
So, given that, would a person who repeatedly ingests an addictive chemical into
their bodies (resulting in that addictive chemical getting TO the brain!) be
considered &quot;diseased&quot; since the brain is not ingesting the chemical by itself?

<p>
Thank you for your response to this continuing inquiry,

Hi again, John,
<p>
Yes, exactly. Heavy drinkers have numerous diseases, like cirrhosis of the liver,
renal failure, brain damage, Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome, and peripheral nerve damage,
but those are all caused by drinking too much alcohol.
What is this &quot;alcoholism&quot; disease that causes people to drink alcohol?
What supposedly makes alcoholics &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;?
<p>
Similarly, what is the &quot;disease&quot; that causes normal people to smoke cigarettes until
they are addicted to nicotine?

<p>
And what &quot;disease&quot; causes normal people to shoot heroin until they are
addicted to it?

Hello Jake,

If you actually need &quot;help&quot;, or a &quot;support group&quot;

<p>
Hello

<p>
I'm about 1/4 through the Internet article an plan on digesting the entire thing in
the next day or two.

<p>
In the mean time, before I have the time to do the research, what is your main
personal motive for the article? &quot;The God concept&quot;?

<p>
Ive been around AA for 20 yrs and when I first got the program, it was a real
miracle in that I'd drunk every day for almost 8 yrs and I was sober for 3 months.
That for me is a miracle.

<p>
I do wonder for all the time and energy spent doing at least a meeting a day and Big
Book work, if there is an alternative? I think there are a lot of crazy people in
the rms....sort of a dumping grown for mental misfits and I want to move beyond
that. But, for me, there is no denying that AA works if you even call it
brainwashing.

<p>
But, I'm new to the program again and giving it a try doing it the AA way for the
first time in my life. It's this simple: I have given real belief in God a chance
and Ive seen some amazing coincidences this past few weeks and I'm grateful to
whatever thing is at work to cause these coincidences in my favor.

<font color="blue">
Hello C.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and I wish you luck.
<p>
My motive is just to get the truth out there: the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. I think that sick people deserve and need to hear the truth.
It's only fair to tell them the truth, and for them to know what really works.

<p>
Your decision to return to A.A. after a relapse is the consequence of your first
decision that you didn't mention: You decided to really quit drinking, and to really
give it your whole effort.
You are now willing to change your life and your self.
Dr. Edgar H. Schein called that &quot;unfreezing&quot; the personality. 
(<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Of course you will experience big changes when you decide to make big changes.
<i>Really decide.</i> Not just sort of decide to do something, but <i>really decide.</i>
<p>
The process is quite simple: You drink until you are dying, and then you decide
not to die that way, and you are willing to do whatever you have to do to keep from
dying that way. I went through the same process.
<p>
The difference with me is simply that I saw that A.A. was a fraud and a cult, and I quit drinking
by using my own intelligence and will power.
<p>
I wish you luck. And if you decide that you want to hang out with some less crazy people,
<a href="orange-letters257.html#alt_list" target="_blank">look here for a list of other groups and programs</a>.

Hello Andrew,
<p>
Thank you for the link. I did not know that there were such rabid true believers
<i>still</i> promoting <i>The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</i>
as if it was a valid historical document. And to pass such racist propaganda
off as &quot;Christian Bible&quot; belief is unreal.

<p>
First off, no, I am not a member of that organization. In fact, we are philosophical enemies.
I have criticized <i>The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</i> before.
Look
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Protocols" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters176.html#Protocols" target="newwin859">here</a>.
<p>
<i>The Protocols</i> is a forgery that was created by the Russian Czar's secret police
&#8212;  specifically, by two hack writers who worked for Ratchkovsky, who was
one of the leaders of the Ochrana, the Russian secret police &#8212; to
try to blame the Jews for Russia's troubles that were really caused by the Czar's incompetent
running of the country.
Ratchkovsky gave the forgery to the Czar, and claimed that it proved that the Jews
were the Czar's enemy. At first, the Czar was fooled by the deception, but he later learned the
truth, and ordered that the book be suppressed and not used. The Czar rightly said that
they could not promote spiritual things &#8212; Christianity &#8212; by such immoral means.
But copies of <i>The Protocols</i> survived, and have been causing troubles ever since.

<p>
The author of those web pages used really brain-damaged logic to try to pass <i>The Protocols</i>
off as genuine. I don't have the time to write a whole book about <i>The Protocols</i>,
and don't need to, as others have already done so.
But I do want to comment on three of his statements:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The first time Nilus published them was in 1901 in a book called The Great Within the Small and reprinted in 1905. A copy of this is in the British Museum bearing the date of its reception, August 10, 1906.
All copies that were known to exist in Russia were destroyed in the Kerensky regime, and under his successors the possession of a copy by anyone in Soviet land was a crime sufficient to ensure the owner's of being shot on sight. The fact is in itself sufficient proof of the genuineness of the Protocols.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first two sentences are almost true. Actually, Nilus was the second publisher.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

A first version had been
prepared toward the end of the nineties [1890s, that is] by Golovinski and Manuilov,
two journalists in the service of Ratchkovsky. This version included Joly's most
impressive bits. For some reason or other the bombshell was left unused for
a few years. It was not hurled until political developments offered a
particularly grateful target.  In 1904-05, the pamphlet was refurbished as an
attack on Prince Svatopulk-Mirski...
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Der Fuehrer</i>, Konrad Heiden, pages 11&#8212;12.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The third sentence of that first quote is questionable &#8212;  I had never before
heard that the Kerensky regime &#8212;  the Russian revolutionaries who overthrew the Czar &#8212; 
destroyed all copies of <i>The Protocols</i>. That may or not be true.
I shall have to check. I know that they didn't get <i>all copies</i>, because Alfred Rosenberg
took one copy from Russia to Germany, where it fell into the hands of the fledgeling Nazi party.
(<a href="orange-letters176.html#Protocols2" target="newwin859">Look here</a>.)

<p>
The &quot;successor&quot; of Kerensky was of course Vladimir Illich Lenin. I also had not heard that
Lenin imposed a death penalty for possession of a copy of the book.
The last sentence of that quote is brain-damaged logic.
Even if Lenin did kill people for having a copy
of the book, that does not prove that the book is genuine. Lenin may well have suppressed
the book because it was created by the hated secret police of the Czar.

<p>
<li>
That very unChristian web site continued:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The claim of the Jews that the Protocols are forgeries is in itself an admission of their genuineness, for they NEVER ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THE FACTS corresponding to the THREATS which the Protocols contain, and, indeed, the correspondence between prophecy and fulfillment is too glaring to be set aside or obscured. This the Jews well know and therefore evade.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is bullshit logic. &quot;The Jews&quot; have repeatedly answered
the accusations in <i>The Protocols</i>.
Even if they had not, that would not be PROOF that the charges are true.
The last sentence is pure racism and bigotry.
<p>
By the way, I'm not Jewish, and I refute and challenge the lies in <i>The Protocols</i>.
It isn't a matter of Jews versus non-Jews.

<p>
For some answers about <i>The Protocols</i>, see these books:

Read through all your stuff as I had heard SOME of the controversy around AA
as I had been in and out of &quot;the program&quot; for a while. Got sober again but
decided after a week of meetings and seeing the same old BS that I'd at
least bring up the 5% success rate, Bill W's womanizing and appropriation of
AA funds, LSD use, etc...

<p>
Oh boy. Never have I been interrupted in a meeting by MULTIPLE people all at
once. It was as though the entire group was trying to shut me up as fast as
they could. Not planning on going back unless it's to help others see there
are other ways.

<p>
Passing along this link. Might copy a few of the experiences so people can
understand better what you're talking about when you're talking about Bill
W's Bella Donna experience in the hospital. I don't think people, myself
included, understand exactly how incredibly hallucinatory Bella Donna is.
Reading through these experiences informed me about exactly how spun out
Bill W must have been in that hospital bed...

Thanks for the site. One of the few honest voices of dissent against a

lack of success, sexual scandal, authority power-tripping, and all other
sorts of messed up stuff that goes on in the halls. Interesting that the

happened to have a few sponsees around them. Wouldn't want the fresh sheep

Hello David,

Thanks for the letter and the compliments.

Your experiences at the A.A. meeting are so revealing, aren't they?
If it's such a spiritual organization, why are they so opposed to
hearing true facts about Alcoholics Anonymous?
<p>
And how is it that they have rule against &quot;cross-talk&quot;,
except if you say something about A.A. that the old-timers don't like,
in which case interrupting the speaker is quite okay?

<p>
The link to Erowid is interesting. Doesn't that extremely poisonous weed sound just like what

Subject:  	Another Way<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
First of all, I just love you and everything you say about AA. It didn't work for
me. I hated the 12 step zombies and their narrow-minded religious cult. Anyway, I'll
make this short and sweet. I've remained sober on my own since 2009. I started
reading books by Dr. Stanton Peele, then others about non-12 step programs. I
attended Woman For Sobriety for about a year and really liked their open discussion
format.
<p>
Recently, I got curious about Passages of Malibu and requested their book.
Of course, I cannot afford their rehab, but I truly believe in the philosophy that
you need to find the underlying cause of addiction and until you find that out, no
12-step program is going to help. I was forced to attend a 12-step rehab program and
recently read their web site and testimonials page. One person praised the program
and said they were having &quot;meeting withdrawals&quot; after not going for a few days.
Well, that says it all, doesn't? AA/NA wants you to become brainwashed into their
way of thinking, which is so antiquated. I don't want to replace one addiction for
another, and that's what AA is. They preach the only way to stay sober is with them,
and it isn't.
<p>
Anyway, if you haven't read or heard of Passages of Malibu, check it
out. A completely holistic approach to sobriety, which is for me.

<p>

Hello Vicki,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety.
<p>
Yes, I know about Passages of Malibu. It is famous for being the spin-dry facility that
all of the movie stars go to. Very high-class, very luxurious, and very expensive.
I was reading their web site years ago and got a laugh out of the advertising that
told starlettes that they would not have to clean toilets as part of their recovery.

I follow the 12 step path.  I have a genuine appreciation for your &#8212;  how
should I put it &#8212;  views on AA.  Don't get me wrong, I find much of oranges
information about AA taken out of context (which I am sure you guys are
smart enough to know) to support its own agenda.  But you are of real
service to AA members &#8212;  (real AA members &#8212;  bet you don't know what I mean by
that &#8212;  we are secretive after all:) as you give us a view of the things we do
badly and it enables us turn a critical eye on ourselves &#8212;  where without you
we (AA) would not.  After all it's not really just AAWS is it?  I mean when
you consider the whole spectrum of AA impact on the world right?  There are
over 50 well organized national 12 programs and AA itself is in over 150
countries (and growing &#8212;  12 steps it seems aren't going the way of the

AA admits it to you or are not! You keep us faithful to the path (thought

Hello Carlston,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
I think your core point is:
<font color="black">
&quot;I mean when you consider the whole spectrum of AA impact on the world right?&quot;
</font>

<p>
Considering what A.A. really does is the whole point of my web site.
And what A.A. does is not good. A.A. kills more people than it saves.
A.A. tells people that they are powerless over alcohol, which becomes a self-fulfilling
prediction, and causes people to relapse worse, and even die.
A.A. tells people not to take their doctor-prescribed medications, which causes more
deaths.
Then A.A. spreads completely untrue ideas about alcoholics and alcohol addiction,
which causes more problems.

<p>
I just covered this subject again recently, so I'll point you to the rest of the list
of evidence of A.A. failure
<a href="orange-letters257.html#harm" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Your final argument was totally false:
<font color="black">
&quot;There are over 50 well organized national 12 programs and AA itself is in over 150
countries (and growing &#8212;  12 steps it seems aren't going the way of the
Washingtonians).&quot;
</font>
<p>
That propaganda trick is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2numbers" target="_blank">Appeal to Numbers (<i>Argumentum ad Numerum</i>)</a>,
and it's bad logic. Having lots of groups and visitors doesn't mean that they are sober,
or that the 12-Step routine actually works to cure anything.
Scientology has lot of groups and offices in cities around the world too, and Scientology
is nothing but a fraud.
Scientology has lots of front groups and auxiliary organizations too.

Scientology even has a &quot;never-fails&quot; cure for alcoholism and drug addiction called Narconon.
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_front_groups" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
Do those front groups prove that Tom Cruise is right when he jumps up and down
on the couch and declares that Scientology knows more about the human mind
than all of the psychiatrists in the world?

<p>
And the truth is, A.A. is shrinking.
So yes, A.A. is actually going the way of the Washingtonians.
Alcoholics Anonymous is a dying dinosaur.

Subject:  	RE: The Hitler myth of the Big Lie<br>

<p>
If you are interested in speaking with or communicating with two historians
regarding WWII and Hitler you can contact the following two women. I suspect
you may have heard of them but if not please check them out. The correct
translated version of Mein Kampf was done by James Murphy. The problem with
ones (mostly Zionist Jews) that make Hitler to be the creator of the Big Lie
and everything he allegedly did is they were done to demonize Hitler.
America needs an enemy for Americans to hate, for those in power to wage
war. The same goes for the western world.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jake,
<p>
The main thrust of my web site is about alcoholism and addiction and recovery and
Alcoholics Anonymous and other cults, especially recovery cults.
Getting into translations of <i>Mein Kampf</i> is getting a little far afield.
<p>
Again, so much of translation is like writing poetry. There may be several
different ways to say something, and all can be correct, and it's just a matter of
style and taste which way to write a translation.
It isn't a matter of incorrect translations.

<p>
And again, &quot;the Zionist Jews&quot; do not need to demonize Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler did that
himself. He and Joseph Stalin were the two biggest mass murderers in the history of the world.
</font>
<p>
My view has changed on most, maybe all of our history, because of men and
women who have and continue to write the unpopular. 911 and the demonization
(to the point where he was hated) of Saddam Hussein beginning with the
horrific hearing Congressman Tom Lantos held. The testimony of that young
woman who claimed Saddam was taking babies out of incubators turned out to
be false; she was the daughter of Kuwait's Ambassador.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I agree that Saddam Hussein was demonized before the invasion of Iraq. And the story
of throwing Kuwaiti babies out of incubators was a fabricated lie, and it indeed was
told by the daughter of the Kuwaiti Ambassador.
</font>
<p>
Other events such as the USS Liberty, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and the
disputed did FDR or did FDR not know about the broken Japanese code in
regards to the attack on Pearl Harbor

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, mostly true. Maybe all true. The Gulf of Tonkin incident that was used to
justify the escalation of the War in Vietnam was really one U.S. Navy ship stupidly firing on another.
<p>
I have my doubts about the story of FDR and the Japanese
code. The way I read history, the U.S. military did not break the Japanese code until
just before the battle of Midway Island.
(Which was why the U.S. won that battle.)

quotes, which need to be researched, and one by Hitler has no source and no

<p>
&quot;The bigger the lie, the more inclined people will be to believe it&quot;
 &#8212; Adolf Hitler

<p>
<font color="blue">
That actually sounds like an alternate translation, or paraphrasing, of

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The greatness of the lie is always a certain factor in being believed; at the
bottom of their hearts, the great masses of a people are more likely to be misled
than to be consciously and deliberately bad, and in the primitive simplicity of
their minds, they are more easily victimized by a large than by a small lie.... Some
part of even the boldest lie is sure to stick.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, I need the full German text of <i>Mein Kampf</i>.
Does somebody have an underground copy?

</font>
<p>
When I inserted the google search of the first part of the quote I
questioned, it was to show you that it did not produce any results from
Hitler.org, which uses the Murphy translation. In 1942 they stopped printing
Murphy's english version of Mein Kampf.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, finding things with literal searches can be a real pain when there are several
different translations of the same book. Not even Google is good at finding alternate
wording with the same meaning. Sometimes they do it, but not consistently well.

</font>
<p>
Another quote when searched all the websites cite the same site as the
soure. When you look at this website
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005313/http://quotes.liberty-tree.ca/quote_blog/Adolf.Hitler.Quote.EE50" target="_blank">
http://quotes.liberty-tree.ca/quote_blog/Adolf.Hitler.Quote.EE50</a>

<p>
they claim
the quote was from Mein Kampf 14th edition in 1935. I searched for that and
all I could find were mentions of this edition and amazingly many sites list
the website above Hitler wrote two volumes, one in 1925 and the second
volume in 1926.

<p>
&quot;Through clever and constant application of propaganda, people can be made
to see paradise as hell, and also the other way around, to consider the most
wretched sort of life as paradise.&quot;
 &#8212; Adolf Hitler, Mein Kampf

<p>
Another quote (some say terror instead of terrorism) produced no sources and
no year it was made, which should make that quote suspect. All I am saying
is we have been lied to time and time again and these lies have dire
consequences; War!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ummm, listing quotes without years or sources is not lying. I have many books of quotes
that I use for the signatures at the ends of letters, and almost none of them
give sources or years.
</font>
<p>
&quot;Terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder
than a fear of sudden death.

<p>
Now, they don't even try to hide their lies. Obama made so many egregious
promises/lies about ending the war, transparent government, closing

I am also disappointed in President Obama's failure to deliver on his campaign promises.
Considering the fact that the Republicans are blocking everything he is trying to do,
and won't allow anything through the House of Representatives, and filibuster in the Senate,
I don't think there is much grounds for the accusation that he &quot;never intended&quot; to
follow through. More like that he just isn't a good fighter.
And he has too many advisors who are too close to Wall Street.

Hello Bob,
<p>
Thank you for a good demonstration of the standard cult characteristic
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks" target="_blank">Personal attacks on critics</a>&quot;.
You have not provided any facts, just attacks.
<p>
I find it interesting that you attack therapists. That is odd, considering how many
so-called &quot;therapists&quot; and &quot;counselors&quot; send patients to Alcoholics Anonymous.
What do you have against therapists?

<p>
Now do you have any facts? Would you care to tell us

Subject:  	The scientific what's what of addiction &#8212; from MIT<br>

<p>
A few years ago the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT presented a
symposium, &quot;On Addiction,&quot; in its Open Mind Series. FYI here's the video.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005313/http://web.mit.edu/picower/events/openmindseries.html" target="_blank">
http://web.mit.edu/picower/events/openmindseries.html</a>

<p>
Some of it is heavy going &#8212; we're in a classroom, after all, and there are some
heavy-hitting pros doing the talking &#8212; but I can assure you it's worth sticking
with. I learned an awful lot about the brain.

<p>
Observe that nobody's wasting any time wrangling over the word disease, whether
inside or outside quotation marks, or capitalized or not capitalized, or whatever.
They had better things to do.

<p>
Here's the gist of it, extracted from the notes I took.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
* The synaptic neurotransmitter Dopamine coordinates responses across many brain
circuits in response to reward-related information.

<p>
<li>
* Dopamine is required for stimulus-action learning, binding value to cues,
conferring incentive properties on them.

<p>
<li>
* Adaptations are the key to addiction, which arises from the usurpation of normal
synaptic-specific mechanisms responsible for reward-related learning and memory.

<p>
<li>
* In short, Dopamine and rewards are acting in what are basically survival pathways.

<p>
<li>
* In addiction there is profound overlearning on drug-related cues and devaluing of
other goals.

<p>
<li>
* The persistence of drug addiction reflects the persistence of these memories in
the form of altered patterns of synaptic connectivity.
</ul>

<p>
For me, anyway, this helps explain why &#8212; as the folk wisdom of recovery puts it &#8212;
you can't turn a pickle back into a cucumber. Our brains have been hijacked. And the
road maps have been falsified. Go on, supply your own metaphors.

<p>
Pro forma, I suppose, there had to be one token enlightened layperson on board, and
who should this be but ...

William C. Moyers, Vice President, External Affairs, Hazelden.

<p>
What a putz! You can sense the people around him squirming in embarrassment.

Hi again, Richard,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I'll have to go check that out.
<p>
I really feel sorry for Bill Moyers (the elder). He has spent his life trying to
get the truth to the American people, and
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Moyers" target="_blank">his son turned into a professional liar</a>
for a bunch of cult-religion quacks. It just ain't fair.

Subject:  	Religious Roots of AA<br>

<p>
Read some of your stuff online. Interesting. I imagine that if Christianity
had started during a time when there were avenues of communication such as
the internet there would have been more people critical of it. I agree with
you that AA is a religion, but I think the 12 steps are actually effective
at bringing people to an awakening, or experience, of the power within
themselves that allows them avoid addictive substances and processes and to
have meaningful lives. I have been given the gift of sobriety for over 23
years now, and I am a PhD candidate doing research on the twelve steps as an
ethic of liberation. Hope you are well.

<p>
Patrick

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Patrick,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And congratulations on your sobriety.

<p>
Yes, Christianity probably might have a harder time getting started today.
Then again, considering the immense numbers of true believers around here,
who have no interest in facts or true information,
primitive Christianity might have done just fine.
Saul of Tarsus became the leader of the early Christian church by having an
epileptic fit and falling off of his horse and hitting his head and seeing God.
And 2000 years later, Bill Wilson became the leader of a world-wide religion by
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">getting dosed with belladonna and seeing God</a>.
Not much has changed.

<p>
But that is really irrelevant, you know. The core point is that A.A and its 12 Steps
<i>are not</i> effective cures for anything.
And they are not empowering, just the opposite.

<p>
<a name="harm"> </a>
In properly-controlled medical tests, A.A. has been proven to be very harmful &#8212;  worse than no treatment or help.
<p>
<ol type="A">
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics. People who were sent to
A.A. ended up, after 9 months of A.A., doing FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got no such help, and NINE TIMES as much
binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for drunkenness.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a> that
&quot;free&quot; A.A. just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
made them require more expensive hospitalization later.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
Doctors Orford and Edwards found</a> that just having a doctor talk to alcoholics and their wives for
just one hour, one time ever, telling them to quit drinking or they were going to die, was just as effective as an
entire year of 12-Step-based treatment that included all of the facilities of the hospital.

<p>
<li>
This one is the most damning evidence of all, because it came from a doctor
who loves Alcoholics Anonymous, and is one of its biggest promoters.
He is (or was) also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Inc..
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>
(who later became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
while he tried to prove that A.A. works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based treatment
program had a zero-percent success rate above
normal spontaneous remission, and worse, it had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
At the end of 8 years, the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients
was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
<p>
But 5% per year is the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics &#8212;
what Dr. Vaillant called &quot;the natural history of alcoholism&quot;.
That's how many alcoholics recover on their own, without any &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;support group&quot;. A.A. cannot claim the credit for those
recoveries, no matter whether they attend some A.A. meetings or not,
and Dr. Vaillant clearly said that.  So 5 minus 5 equals zero, the real A.A. recovery rate.

<p>
<li> And then, even though these items have not been surveyed and documented by doctors,
there is plenty of evidence that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">the A.A. suicide rate</a>
 and
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">the A.A. divorce rate</a> are big problems too.

</ol>
<p>
The 12 Steps are simply not a cure. The 12 Steps are Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion
practices for converting and indoctrinating new recruits. They are brainwashing techniques.
