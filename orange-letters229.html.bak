I was cleaning out my bookmarks and I came across &quot;Orange Papers&quot;,  I
wrote several times to you beginning about four and a half years ago
over a period of several months.  I had been an extremely hard core
alcoholic in my early twenties, including full blown DTs several times
and months in and out of 12 step rehab.  I finally got clean in a
program for heroin addicts that was not 12 step. or even God centered
in any way.  I was sober for 19 years and then I screwed up and
started binge drinking for about 2 years, went to AA hated it. Read
your work and it reinforced what I already knew to be true; staying
sober is a personal decision only I can make.  Just wanted to let you
know I will not have drank for five years again next week.  I quit
following your &quot;papers&quot; over four years ago: not because I disagreed
with them, it's just that I &quot;got on with my life&quot; and that meant not
dwelling on two years of the last 26.  By the way I do think AA has
some value;  If I ever actually think about drinking again all I have
to do is remember AA and ask myself &quot;do you really ever want to  have
to go to one of those meetings again?&quot;  just kidding; you do good work
for people who are new to sobriety.  But there is a time to move
along, so I thought I would send off this note before I deleted your
bookmark.

read some of the comments.... membership slowly receding. Too bad no one started a
secular, open to one all, fellowship back in Wilsons time. Some of the 'secular
sobrety' on line sites and meetings I have checked out are usually run by a 'guru'.
One flamed me once, in error I got his 'org' mixed up with a breakaway org. Do we
have to walk on eggshells just to socialize and share with our fellows who have had
problems with alcohol, substances?
<p>

Hi Donald,
<p>
I sure hope we don't have to all walk on eggshells. I hope everybody can just lighten
up. One of the reasons that I stopped going to A.A. meetings was that I was required
to only say approved things if I was going to get their approval. In fact, they wanted
a show &#8212; either a tearful confession or a stand-up comedy routine. 
Nobody wanted to even admit that taboo subjects existed, never mind actually
talk about them honestly. (Like the real origin of the 12 Steps.)
<p>
To me, a discussion group is useless if you can't tell the truth without having people
attacking you.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Beth,
<p>
Thanks for the link. Sorry to take so long to answer &#8212; I just discovered a handful of
letters from the end of January that I had overlooked.
<p>
I watch <i>Criminal Minds</i> all of the time &#8212; indulging my dark
side I guess &#8212; but I missed that episode.  I'll have to catch it
on reruns. Not only was the article interesting, but some of the comments
were a real laugh.

<p>
I really appreciate the way that the script writers emphasized the danger of A.A. meetings:
&quot;AA meetings can be dangerous... You never know WHO you are sitting next to,
now do you?&quot;
<p>
At an A.A. meeting, I was creeped out by hearing a very large guy &quot;sharing&quot;
the story of how
he would fly into a rage and try to kill his best friend, grabbing him by the throat
and trying to shove him out of the car window while driving down the freeway at
60 miles per hour.
<p>
Uh yeh, right, and I'm supposed to get life advice from these people?
<p>
(Ah, but now I'm taking somebody else's inventory, aren't I?)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
== Orange
<p>
P.S. I've been reading the
article and the comments, and was reminded of something:

<p>
If you are in Scientology, and complain that you are angry at somebody,
a Scientologist will immediately ask you, &quot;What did you do to him?&quot;

<p>
It is supposedly all your fault, no matter what the other guy might have
done to you. In Scientology, you are supposed to
be just happy and cheerful all of the time &#8212; &quot;up-scale&quot;,
&quot;Up the Emotional Tone Scale&quot; &#8212; and if
you are angry &#8212; &quot;down-scale&quot; &#8212; then you must have done 
something wrong &#8212; something &quot;unethical&quot;.  You couldn't possibly
be justifiably angry about somebody having done something to you.
No, if you are &quot;down-scale&quot;, then you must have done something
wrong to bring yourself down.

<p>
Sound familiar? That is
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong" target="_blank">standard Cult Characteristic Number Two:
You Are Always Wrong</a>. (Number One being:
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">The Guru Is Always Right</a>.)
It is also an example of
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_perfection" target="_blank">Demands for Super-Human Perfection</a>&quot; &#8212; even
as an abused child, you supposedly should have done a better job of 
controlling the world.
And it is also the standard cult characteristic
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_feel" target="_blank">Don't Feel Your Own Feelings</a>.

<p>
And in Alcoholics Anonymous, it is of course presented to you as
<ul>
<li>  &quot;You cannot have a resentment.&quot;
<li>  &quot;You must be Serene and Grateful.&quot;
<li>  &quot;It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.&quot;
(Bill Wilson, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, page 90.)
<li> &quot;Find your part in it.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
So if somebody abused you as a child, it's your fault, no matter
whether you are in A.A. or Scientology.

<p>
I've come across your &quot;orange papers&quot; on the internet several times.
Here is my reaction. I browse a little and see some things I like and
dislike. Mostly it screams anger at me. I can see what you're trying
to do, and I understand some of your indignation. If you've had
problems with alcohol or drugs, and no doubt things can get very
confusing. AA meetings are just that, meetings.  It's a support group.
They were never really set up to be a &quot;cure&quot;. I agree that that the
many recovery institutions in the past bastardized various 12 step
ideas and made them their own with some success and failure. It's
clear you don't like Bill Wilson, or are jealous of him or something.
I'm not really sure. I think he was a flawed man, like most of us.
The idea of being powerless, however, doesn't appear to be understood.
It's not new, or quackery or whatever. It simply states that we don't
have power over people places and things, but we do have power over
how we react to them. This is a major tenet of not just AA, but of
mindfulness, aspects of Buddhism, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
Modern Addiction Concepts are changing, there are no real clear
answers, but things are getting better with science and better
studies. I hope you find what you are looking for, as you have spent a
lot of time on your project.

<font color="blue">
Hello Max,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That is quite an apology for Alcoholics Anonymous.
It is of course a mess of minimization and denial, something that A.A. says
alcoholics are good at.

<p>
Starting at the top, it is not a flaw or a defect to be angry at
quacks and frauds who hurt sick people by foisting ineffective quackery on them &#8212;
which is what A.A. is. Being angry is not &quot;axiomatically spiritually wrong&quot;,
like Bill Wilson wrote. When they tell you that you cannot be angry, they are
cutting off your balls and keeping you from being a whole person.

<p>
A.A. meetings are far more than just meetings. They are sessions where lies and
fraud are passed off as holy wisdom and a cure for a deadly problem.
In particular, Bill Wilson's lies and fraud.
From the moment you recite Bill's words,
&quot;RARELY have we seen...&quot; it is a stream of lies and logical fallacies
and propaganda tricks, not helpful advice on how to get sober.

<p>
Bill Wilson was far more than just &quot;flawed&quot;, he was a psychopath who didn't care
how many people he hurt in his pursuit of praise, wealth, sex, and self-glorification.
Bill Wilson had no problem with lying and pushing Frank Buchman's cult religion as a never-fails
&quot;solution&quot; to the problem of alcohol abuse, in spite of the fact that he had many
years of experience in seeing it fail to help.

<p>
I do not misunderstand the &quot;powerless&quot; idea. You are trying to reinterpret
Step One and make it say things that it does not say &#8212; which is typical of how
Steppers are constantly trying to rewrite the Steps and make them into
something more than what they are. That's why there are so many books that 
supposedly explain the Steps.  Step One says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.</b><br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's it.  Step One does not say one word about us being powerless over people, places,
or things, just alcohol.

<p>
Lastly, I have found what I was looking for. I have 10 years of sobriety now, and
I thank God that I don't have to go to any cult religion meetings to stay sober.
<p>
So why are you still going to A.A. meetings?
 Have you still not found what you need?

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I recently became involved with an &quot;wilson follower&quot; of 18 months. At first, I didnt
think it was going to be an issue. As time progressed, I noticed that she was using
many catch phrases with me. She had also wanted me to read a couple of alanon books
that she had. At one point, she had played a cruel joke on me and when it upset me
she said I needed to take responsibility for my own reaction to it. I found this not
only cruel, but odd. I saw the example you had of when someone hurts you, you need
to figure out what you did wrong. I downloaded the 12 12 book, and it was plain as
day. I started researching and found many of the hurtful things that she was saying
to me were from the book. She denies to this day that they were from the book
though. I will not read the alanon books because it is hurtful to see the
brainwashing she has gone through.

<p>
I am a Christian and find the AA teachings to be very non-Christian.

<p>
Your web page has helped me a great deal in learning what to look for as far as
protecting myself from the AA cult. I'm not sure if you are just one person doing
this wonderful eye opening research or if there are any, LOL I hate to use the word
&quot;groups&quot;, or places to help expose the cult. This cult has turned what could have
been a wonderful relationship between 2 people in to another statistic of how the
teachings break relationships apart.

<p>
Any more information would be much appreciated

Hello D Max,

Thank you for the letter and thanks for the compliments. I'm sorry to hear

About your question &#8212; there is just me, one person, writing this web site.
I have friends and acquaintances who send me things, but it is basically just me,
working on getting the truth out.
<p>
About more information: several things come to mind:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> There are many groups and forums that are devoted to exposing the truth
about the recovery industry fraud. I just published the list again in a previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters228.html#alt_list" target="_blank">here</a>. Some of the
items on that list are various methods for recovery from addiction problems, and
some are just forums for people to communicate and commiserate.
All of them are good places to talk to other people and share experiences and information.

<p><li> For more information about cults and cult characterisistics, see 
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>.

<p><li> Then, see
<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">the links page</a>
for many more pointers to other information.

<p><li> Then of course there is all of the rest of this web site.
</ol>
<p>
I agree that the A.A. teachings are very non-Christian. I wrote a web page about
that:

<p>
AA is certainly not a cult. It has no fees or official membership lists and no
requirements at all, other than a desire to quit drinking. The 12 steps are
suggested only. No one lives in a compound, is required to give money or allegiance
or to believe anything. AA is actually the quintessential democratic American
institution.

<p>
You seem to have much knowledge of AA, yet you don't seem to know these most basic
facts about AA. And you have a real resentment against Buchman. You are probably a
jealous, hateful, destructive and deceptive Jew &#8212; that is my best guess. But then
you could  be a crazed atheist, or maybe just an insecure mainstream Christian. But
my best estimate is that you are the type of Jew as described above. Am I right?

Wayne S.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Wayne,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Your denial of the cult characteristics of A.A. doesn't
hold much water.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The defining characteristics of a cult are not whether members
pay dues or whether there is an official membership list. Whether a cult is money-grubbing
is only one of a hundred common cult characteristics in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>, and an official
membership list isn't a cult characteristic at all.

<p><li>
The Twelve Steps are not just &quot;suggestions&quot;. That is one of the standard A.A.
bait-and-switch tricks:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

<p>
Also, <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.</a>

<p><li> You don't have to live in a compound to be in a cult. Most cults do not have
isolated compounds. Members of Scientology, the Moonies, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and
Amway are all free to come and go as they chose (or are ordered to), but they are still
in a cult.

<p><li>
Alcoholics Anonymous most assuredly requires that people believe things.
<b>&quot;[We] Came to believe&quot;</b>
is the start of Step Two, isn't it? The claim that A.A. requires no beliefs is just
another one of Bill Wilson's lies, a recruiting deception,

Question:

<p>
Why do you care so much about AA?

<p>
If it does not work for you, don't go, simple as that.<br>
For those that it does work for, great. (better than being a drunk, angry, afraid,
etc.)

<p>
I would not waste my time bashing an organization that doesn't work for me (even
though millions have found AA extremely useful).

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello T.,
<p>
Why care so much about Alcoholics Anonymous? Because A.A. is a fraud
that hurts millions.
A.A. has taken over the majority of the treatment centers in the USA,
where people get fed cult religion as a quack cure for drug and alcohol
problems. That hurts people. That even kills them.  Alcoholics Anonymous
is the most successful cult and the biggest medical fraud in the USA.
That's why I care.
<p>
The rest of your rationalization is all wrong, just a string of incorrect statements:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
It is not a matter of <i>&quot;If it doesn't work for you, don't go.&quot;</i>
People are being sentenced to A.A. meetings, and sick people who paid
for &quot;treatment&quot; are being forced into A.A. meetings.
That is a crime.

<p><li>
A.A. does not &quot;work for others&quot;.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
One of the leaders of A.A., Non-Alcoholic Trustee Dr. George E. Vaillant
clearly proved that A.A. actually just raises the death rate in alcoholics,
while not helping the alcoholics to get sober at all</a>.
And other doctors have also shown that A.A. does not work.
In controlled tests,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. just raised the rate of binge
drinking</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">A.A. raised the rate of 
 rearrests for drunkenness</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">A.A. raised the 
cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.


<p><li>
This is a piece of standard A.A. propaganda, completely untrue:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
millions have found AA extremely useful
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
No, they haven't. A.A. doesn't even have 2 million members in the whole
world. They have a few hundred thousand hard-core members, and the rest
of the apparent membership is just churn: newcomers shoved, sucked, and
coerced in, and newcomers gone a few months later.
<a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">Look here for the details</a>.
<p>
And since A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics, but not the sobriety rate, that
is not &quot;extremely useful&quot; to &quot;millions&quot;.
<p>
The fact that a few hundred thousand people rave that they really love
their cult religion and &quot;find it helpful&quot; does not make
Alcoholics Anonymous a good organization. Scientology and the Moonies
have a bunch of crazy members who say the same things too.
Tom Cruise will jump up and down on the couch and tell you that Scientology
knows more about the human mind than all of the doctors in the world.
And Cruise will tell you that Scientology did Step Two for him &#8212;
&quot;restoring him to sanity&quot;.
Tom will also tell you that Scientology has the only working cure for drug
and alcohol problems &#8212; Scientology plus &quot;Narconon&quot;
plus a &quot;Toxic Rundown&quot; Purification Treatment.
The truth is, the Scientologists and the Steppers are both crazy, and neither have
a working cure.

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Your Question on AA Trustee's Salary<br>

<p>
Hi Terry, saw your question re the AA Trustee's salary on your site today.  You
referenced my &quot;AA's Own Stats Show Slow Demise&quot; on Stinkin-Thinkin.com in letters
216.

<p>
I served four years as a
<font color="blue">[deleted]</font>, attended four
<font color="blue">[deleted]</font>, and served on four <font color="blue">[deleted]</font>.
I've been sober for 29+ plus years, but the <font color="blue">[deleted]</font> experience woke
me up quickly that there was something not right in the AA picture: it was all show
and churn.

<p>
Anyway, enough on my credentials to know the answer to your question:  No, the
trustees do not earn a salary at all.  The Class A ones, who serve six years, and
the Class B (the drunks), who serve four years, are all unpaid.  However, all their
AA-related expenses are paid, they dine very well in mid-town Manhattan at the
regular and corporate board meetings (4 quarterly meetings for certain but monthly
meetings for those who are serving on the AAWS or Grapevine boards), and are housed
in the fairly cosmopolitan Crown Plaza Hotel at 49th and Broadway.   They journey up
to the Riverside Drive headquarters for the monthly meetings, but the quarterly ones
are held at the hotel.

<p>
The general manager is well paid, around $250K I think.  The number in the form 990
has to be doubled because the GM is paid from both the AAWS and General Service
Board, one half from each.  The rest of the top staff earn salaries in the $100K
range, depending on tenure and have a good health plan and retirement plan.  The
remainder of the staff earn typically non-profit competitive wages for the NYC area.
The retirement plan is a pension, not a 401K, but the plan is currently
underfunded.  That's one reason the game goes on:  about 90 staff mouths to feed and
a bunch of retirees who have the pension that has to be paid.

<p>
It has become increasingly difficult for AA to recruit the Class A folks.  Vaillant
was probably the last one (he had rotated from the board before I got there in 2005)
many people had ever heard of, well, maybe his research partner, Dr. Bill Clark, but
they have to hustle nowadays to find &quot;names.&quot;   Class B's, well, you know the story:
Just grateful, so grateful, to be of service to God and AA and to get the tour of
Stepping Stones each annual conference and to be able to touch Bill's papers in the
Archives and such.  It's certainly not a very awake bunch whichever class they are
in.  They are clearly presiding over an institution in serious decline and they
don't have a clue what's wrong or how to fix it.  God, of course, is in charge and
he'll fix it if it needs fixing!

<p>
The current chair of the General Service Board, elected in 2009, is the Very
Reverend Ward Ewing, Class A Trustee and just retired President, General Theological
Seminary, NYC (Episcopal).  So, finally a man of the cloth as the head.

<p>
You can identify me as &quot;sober by choice,&quot; but leave out the email address and the
reference to my serving on <font color="blue">[deleted]</font>.
I don't need more emails from the trolls!

<p>
Always appreciate your letters and the material on your site.

Hi &quot;sober by choice,&quot;,
<p>
Thank you for the information. Yes, Greg Muth gets $250,000 per year,
half of it from the GSB and the other half from AAWS. The Form 990's reveal that.
And the Form 990's don't list any salaries
for the Trustees or Board of Directors, which is what got me
wondering after someone asked me about salaries, and I got to searching for proof.
Years ago,
<a href="orange-letters16.html#Trustees" target="_blank">
I read somewhere that the Trustees got $75,000 per year each</a>, but that
is pretty obviously wrong.

<p>
<a name="Form990"> </a>
Investigating those Form 990's did yield some very interesting results, though:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters65.html#AA_financials2" target="_blank">The Form 990 for 2004</a>
stated that Lillianna Murphy, the EDP Manager, got $175,742 for the year. Well,
<a href="orange-letters117.html#Lillianna" target="newwin112">Lillianna Murphy wrote to me</a>
after she found her name mentioned in my web site, and she said that she didn't get even half
that much money. So who put the extra money in his pocket? And isn't filing false
financial reports with the IRS a felony?

<p><li>
While I was searching, I stumbled across something else very curious:
Look at page 26 (page 24 of the PDF file) of the 2008 Form 990 for the General Service Board.
(Local copy of file here:
<a href="2008-990GSBAA.pdf">2008-990GSBAA.pdf</a>.)
Some guy named Thomas Jasper is listed as a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;,
and he was allegedly paid $417,459.00 reportable income plus $52,391.00
of &quot;other compensation&quot;, apparently for one year of giving advice.
Yes, being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;
to Greg Muth and the General Service Board for a year gets you nearly half a million dollars,
almost double what the President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets.
Oh really?  I smell a rat. Is somebody looting the A.A. treasury? It sure looks like it.

<p>
I wonder if Mr. Thomas Jasper reported that income to the IRS. Did he really get that money?
Or is it a fake charge, like the money that Lillianna Murphy didn't get?
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
[UPDATE: 2012.03.31: There is more information about Thomas Jasper and his huge going-away present
<a href="orange-letters236.html#paid_trustees" target="_blank">here</a>.]
</font>
<p>
Heck, if Greg Muth wants an advisor, I'll happily follow him around and babble spiritual
slogans at him for half a million dollars a year:
<ul>
<li> &quot;A stitch in time saves nine.&quot;
<li> &quot;Honesty is the best policy.&quot;
<li> &quot;Not all that glitters is gold.&quot;
<li> &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;
<li> &quot;Put new batteries in your bullshit detector.&quot;
<li> &quot;My kharma just ran over your dogma.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
Yes, I can give advice for half a millions dollars a year.
</ol>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I stumbled upon the same page somehow. When I clicked on &quot;This is

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221803/http://www.alladdictsanonymous.org/articles_startwith.htm" target="_blank">
http://www.alladdictsanonymous.org/articles_startwith.htm</a><br>

This page is lifted directly from Tom Powers the elder's book
<i>&quot;Invitation to a Great Experiment: Exploring the Possibility that God can be Known&quot;</i>
which is rework of his <i>&quot;First Questions..&quot;</i> book.

<p>
Even the photo looks like the same alarm clock as is in the
<i>&quot;Invitation..&quot;</i> book. The other main difference between the two is the
omission of the chapters in the later book in which Powers senior
argues for an afterlife based on his study of the Bible, Rudolph
Steiner, occult stories (occult as in spooky ghost stories not
alchemical) and so on. What I really like about both books is the
graded reading list Powers provides.

<p>
As to the AAA program, I'll have to do some more reading. I still
like Powers' <i>&quot;First Questions...&quot; book</i>. It came into my life when I
needed some some spiritual direction. Religion wasn't doing it and
neither was vast amounts of reading and study. I have moved on since
then.

<p>
These last two weeks in Japan have kept me in a constant state of
watchfulness and preparedness. You never know when and where the

I read your website in regards to Bill Wilson and A.A. and felt inclined to

possibly make a web site about a man, bashing him about smoking, and perhaps a
mental disorder(are you a doctor?), and write, cite books and other useless
information and theories about a disease that you do not have. As far as Bill
Wilson his personal life, message of hope, the thousands of lives he saved, and
the program of A.A.(which you failed to mention) It worked for me and continues
to work for countless others. I just want to let you know that each and every
person I know is spiritual in some way, I practice spiritual progress not
perfection as did Bill Wilson. I hope with all that information you realize that
no person in this world is perfect nor should they be held on standards like
that. I am very concerned with your misconceptions and look forward to hearing
from you. I hope by no means that this letter offended you the way your website
offended me.

Hello Jenn,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I am not &quot;a drunk&quot; now. I used to be, but I have not had a drink or a drug or a cigarette
in 10 years now, so I'm not a drunk any more.
I've described all of that many times before. Look here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

<p>
Now, to get down to brass tacks: You believe that I have written something wrong
about Bill Wilson. What? Please be very specific. What did I say that is untrue,
and where did you get your version of the truth?
<p>
I research very carefully, and most all of the damaging information about
Bill Wilson actually comes from his own writings or official A.A. council-approved
publications, and the rest of it comes from favorable biographies that were written
by sympathetic friends like the Hazelden Foundation and Matthew J. Rafael and
Robert Thomsen and Lois Wilson's secretary Francis Hartigan.
(In fact, it is very hard &#8212; basically impossible &#8212; to find
an unfavorable biography of Bill Wilson, because only
A.A. insiders have bothered to write biographies of Bill Wilson.)
Nevertheless, the truth is there for those who wish to find it.
<p>

<p>
Now, would you like to tell me what I wrote that is wrong? Please be very specific.
And please explain how you have better sources of information than I do,
and how you know more about Bill Wilson than I do?
<p>
And tell us what your sources of information are, so we can go read the stuff too.
Oh, and please explain how <i>those</i> authors whom you favor
knew what they were writing about, since
I think I've already covered all of the best biographies by the A.A. insiders.
<p>
And since you feel that I am not qualified to diagnose a raving lunatic when I see one,
how do you explain Bill Wilson's lying, thieving, philandering self-promotion and
delusions of grandeur and obvious narcissism?
And Bill raving about God and &quot;Absolute Purity&quot; and &quot;Absolute Honesty&quot;
and &quot;Absolute Unselfishness&quot; and passing himself off as a messenger
while using A.A. as a meat market, and stealing the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i>
and lying about all of it? And passing off an old cult religion as a special cure
&#8212; or &quot;non-cure but solution&quot; &#8212; to the deadly problem of alcohol addiction?

<p>
And you know, it takes a really special kind of creep to deceive hundreds of thousands
of sick people in the name of God.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange.

<p>
Hope all is going great with you. Me not so much but this isn't about me.
<p>
Well in the end, she came back home after shelling out the 40,000 via others
since she doesn't have it. What they did at this facility, was put her on a
drug similar to methadone. When she left not on their schedule, they gave
her a 2 day supply. She had to scramble because the drug isn't licensed here
completely.
<font color="blue">[In Canada.]</font>
 So she is now on the waiting list for Methadone while she takes
the drug that was approved in Ontario but not yet in MB. Oh well, paying for
that treatment, then getting put on meds while they could have easily
de-toxed her themselves and now waiting for methadone. Sounds like a
wonderful way to screw around if you have the money.
<p>
My sister who had a brain mess-up who was in A.A. but is now in some home
waiting for surgery on her heels so she can get to a rehab and learn to walk
again, says that many of the women who are married to lawyers and such spend
thousands going away to rehabs. What a scam!!! Well at least Charlie Sheen
called out A.A. he must have read your stuff.

Hi again, Cindy,
<p>
So it ended up in a $40,000 rip-off, huh? It sure is profitable to run treatment
centers that sell 12-Step recovery to the suckers. And it's so easy because you don't
have to cure anybody, or produce any good results at all.

<p>
I hope it works out okay for your friend and sister.
<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Steve A.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	RE: AA<br>

<p>
You have ignored the  facts I gave you, just because I didn't show you on paper
doesn't mean they are not facts I told you the facts and since you don't know what
I've been through you will never understand. So I won't try again. But what I will
say is this, I don't like you and your  opinion very much because you don't care
about me you only care that you prove your right. You think because you found
something on the internet, it makes you right. Well if it means that much to you to
argue with someone you don't know about a topic you have no experience on, then go
right ahead and think your right if it makes you feel better. The fact is you just
like to argue. If you really wanted me to listen to you it  might help if you showed
some compassion. I got angry because you were acting like another &quot;hole with an
opinion&quot; I hope you're not! So let's start again, What's your name friend?,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Steve,
<p>
I did not ignore any &quot;facts&quot; that you gave me, because you did not give me any facts.
Your letters were just unsupported opinions, devoid of any actual facts.
Here is your entire previous letter, and there is not a single fact in it, just cult
dogma:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Because you are not a hopeless drunk you will never understand what I'm telling
you. I did not heal myself the people that got sober before me taught me the tools I
did not know before. I know you think your God's little messenger but your just
another hole with an opinon.

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Claiming that I cannot understand how wonderful A.A. is because I'm not a &quot;hopeless drunk&quot;
is not a fact. That is just a standard cult trick. Cults routinely claim that cult members know more
than outsiders. The cult says that non-members just cannot understand how wonderful the cult is, and what
a genius the founder is.
You get the same thing from Scientologists and Moonies and Hari Krishnas and all of the other
cults.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">The occult practices of
 Frank Buchman's strange religion</a>
are not
&quot;tools&quot;, they are just superstitious cult practices. Even contemporary
clergy said so.

<p><li> I never claimed to be God's messenger. That was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#denied_recovery" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's delusion of grandeur</a>,
not mine. I don't rave about walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe on
the Broad Highway in the sky.
(See the <i>Big Book</i>, pages 52 and 75.)
</ol>

<p>
Likewise,
<a href="orange-letters218.html#Steve_A" target="_blank">your first letter</a>
 did not contain any facts, either:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I can tell you have never been a part of the 12 step program.  Your whole
intent is to put a spin on it.  You may think you know what talking about
but you don't.  This program is not about getting people to heaven it is
about keeping them out of hell on earth.  Whatever it's origins are I don't
care.  Frankly you could use some help yourself with your religious
bitterness .
<p>
My life was saved by this 12 step program asshole!
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Stating that you don't care that the 12-Step program is actually
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">the practices of an old pro-Nazi cult religion</a>
does not explain away the many problems with Bill Wilson's
crazy religion, or its failure to cure alcoholics.
<p>
Imagining that such a fascist cult religion cured you is an opinion, not a fact.

<p>
Now, do you have any real FACTS?
<ul>
<li>
How about the A.A. cure rate? If we send 1000 randomly-chosen alcoholics to A.A.,
how many of them will be clean and sober a year later?
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
And

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.


<p><li> What rate of binge drinking does A.A. produce?
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p><li> What is the A.A. death rate?

<p><li> What is the A.A. divorce rate?

</ul>

<p>
Have a good day.
