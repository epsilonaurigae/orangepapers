Hey A. Orange,
<p>
     A.A. is for those that want it.

<p><font color="blue">
The Hazelden Foundations teaches that A.A. is for everyone that you can
<a href="orange-not_good.html#coercive_recruiting">force into the organization</a>.
And A.A. members routinely do everything in their power to
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">coerce more people into A.A.</a>.

</font><p>

  They tell everyone that comes in, &quot;try it for a year then if
things haven't changed go out and do it on your own&quot;.


<p><font color="blue">
That is
<a href="orange-heresy.html#try_it">a standard cult come-on</a>.
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Just try our program for a month or a year,
 and you will see that it is all true.&quot;</i></font>
But if you do the cult's program for a year, you will be so brainwashed that
you really will believe that it is all true.
<p>
The Nichiren Shoshu Buddhists said that if I just tried chanting their chants for
a month, I would see that it really works, and if it didn't, then they would quit.
Well, I tried it, and saw that it didn't work.
I also saw that they wanted my life, and I didn't care to give it
to them, so I quit. They didn't keep their promise to also quit.
That is typical of cults.
</font><p>

  The thing is alot of these people for some reason
or another find a reason in their own hearts to go back to the bottle on their own.  What you want us to
do line them up and shoot them after their first white chip?  Sew their mouths shut and cut off their
hands?  Kick them in the balls for 90 days?  Create masses of graves of dead alcoholics to show all the
new drunks that come in, that we mean business, and they aren't gonna ruin our statistics?  Tell their
mommies if they go back out and drink?

<p><font color="blue">
What is that nonsense supposed to mean? Are you trying to make up some excuses
for why A.A. is not responsible for the failures, dropouts, and relapsers?<br>
Either the program works and sobers people up and keeps them sober,
or it doesn't. Period.<br>
Well, <a href="orange-effectiveness.html">A.A. doesn't work</a>. Period.<br>
The A.A. program is just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Bill Wilson's screwy cult religion</a>. Period.
</font><p>

Apparently you spunt as much time on this website as you did your own
drinking.  This is your parogative in life.  It is what you do instead
of drinking.  We folks of Alcoholics Anonymous have a sydnicate of
friends at each meeting we attend, or at least I do.  These are the
people of my home town that get together several times a week and have
coffee and cookies and talk shit, shoot shit,  maybe look like shit and
sometimes feel like shit.  On the other hand most days we are just
sitting around having grattitude that today don't suck.

<p><font color="blue">
So you use A.A. as a social club. Tell that to the judges who have been told that
A.A. is an alcoholism rehabilitation program. I imagine that the judges will be
a little less eager to sentence people to a religious social club.
</font><p>
<a name="no_Bill"> </a>
There is very little that Bill W. had to do with any of us
staying sober as fars as docterine.

<p><font color="blue">
You may ignore Bill Wilson, but most of the A.A. true believers do not.
Tell me,
<ul>
<li> Do you believe Step One, that you are &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol?
<li> Do you believe Step Two, that you are insane?
<li> Do you believe that you must surrender your will and your life in Step Three?
<li> Do you believe that you must do a Fifth Step and confess all of your sins,
moral shortcomings, and defects of character to another person and God?
<li> Do you believe that God will remove the desire to drink, as well as all of
your other faults, in Step Seven?
<li> Do you believe that you really
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">hear God talking to you</a> in Step Eleven?
Do you believe in
<a href="orange-heresy.html#channelling">channelling spirits</a>?
</ul>
<p>
If you believe any of that stuff, then you do believe in the religious doctrines
of William Griffith Wilson.
</font><p>

He just simply laid out a set of tools to relieve us of ourselves. 

<p><font color="blue">
What tools?
<a href="orange-interpreted.html">
There are no tools, just cult religion</a>. And who says that people need to
be &quot;relieved of themselves&quot;? That is another standard cult characteristic &#8212;
<a href="orange-heresy.html#mundane">
demands that you obliterate &quot;self&quot; and &quot;selfishness&quot;</a>.
</font><p>

Which also tells me, it is none of my Business what you or anyone thinks
of me or about me.  Also, it is none of your business what I think about
you as well....  His teachings are mearly common scence. 
Someting I had very little of when I was sick and boozing it up everyday.  

<p><font color="blue">
There is very little common sense in the ravings of the lunatic Bill Wilson.
He was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">so insane</a>
that he even preached that you have to abandon human
intelligence and Reason, and just &quot;have faith&quot; in his grandiose delusions:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe
that our human intelligence was the last word... Rather vain of us,
wasn't it?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,
even against organized religion. ...
People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge
of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason
had brought us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and
did not like to lose our support.<br>

</font><p>

Trying to find the reason that I have 5 years sober, or any other person
has 30 years sober is only
the actions of someone wanting to spoil the party for someone else.

<p><font color="blue">
What is that nonsense? You imagine that trying to understand what helps people to
maintain sobriety will &quot;spoil the party&quot;?
You really do have a major problem with
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#unscientific_doctors">cultish anti-intellectualism</a>,
don't you? The thought-stopping slogan is
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Utilize, Don't Analyze&quot;</font>, right?
</font><p>

The act of being complacently
miserable in ones own life...  I don't believe that it is your duty to labor so hard in life to destroy
something you hardly have an understanding of.  You said yourself you don't understand it.
<p><font color="blue">
I said no such thing. I understand cult mentality and
<a href="orange-cult.html">the workings of cult religions</a>
very well.
</font><p>

I will admit
there are people that are in the program that go to any legnths to be a bleeding deacon, but there are
millions that remember where they came from and believe that it helps them, to see sober drunks in
everyday situations, dealing with life on life's terms.
<p><font color="blue">
Believing that it works is worthless, just like believing that the world is flat
is worthless.
The truth is what matters, and the truth is that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">A.A. does not work</a>,
and A.A. does not fix the problem of alcoholism.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">A.A. does not keep millions sober</a>.
A.A. is quack medicine.
</font><p>

You should have taken the truth about the program that is written in the 12 Traditions. 

<p><font color="blue">
The Twelve Traditions are a joke &#8212; just some more hypocritical grandiose statements that
members disregard whenever it is convenient.
<ul>
<li>
You have a bunch of leaders of AAWS in New York
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">who committed felonious perjury</a>
in Germany and Mexico to financially ruin or put in prison other A.A. members
who committed the &quot;crime&quot; of printing cheap versions of old, out-of-copyright
versions of the <i>Big Book</i> and giving them away to poor alcoholics &#8212; you know,
Tradition Five, carrying the message.
<li> AAWS has also decided that Tradition Six says that they should not let matters of
spirituality interfere with making more money.
<li>
AAWS has been running TV commercials to get more members, in violation of the
11th Tradition &#8212; that A.A. is supposed to be a program of attraction, not promotion.
<li>
The Hazelden Foundation teaches members how to practice coercive recruiting and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#coercive_recruiting">use the criminal
justice system to force more victims into A.A.</a>, which is also a program of
promotion, not attraction.
<li>
The Seventh Tradition says that A.A. is supposed to be self-sufficient, declining
outside contributions. Bill Wilson made a big deal out of declining a $10,000 donation.
But the current leadership had no problem with taking over $100,000 from
the city of San Diego for holding a convention there.
<li>
Tradition Eleven also says that people are supposed to stay anonymous
in matters of publicity, but Bill Wilson and Marty Mann spent years
breaking their anonymity, grandstanding, and promoting A.A.. They even
went and testified before Congress.
<li> Tradition Nine says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A.A., as such, ought never be organized&quot;</font>, but they don't
follow that tradition any more than they follow the others.
A.A. is totally organized and legally incorporated.
Alcoholics Anonymous
has two national headquarters, one each for A.A.W.S. and the G.S.O., and
$10 million in the bank, and executives, a board of trustees, and a national
council, and regional, state, and local offices. It's organized.

</ul>
<p>
The Twelve Traditions are merely window decoration to be
shown to the public, and then ignored in practice.
</font><p>
     
AA runs no treatment centers.  AA isn't affialiated with them, even if
the Treatment center affaliates themselves with AA, for one reason or another.

<p><font color="blue">
Who cares if Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. owns any treatment facilities?
True-believer A.A. members run a zillion of them, all dedicated to shoving the 12-step
cult religion on more victims.
</font><p>
     

We cannot stop the bandwagon effect of people wanting our success
stories of 30, 40, 50, and 60 years clean and sober.


Just like everyone loves the winner of the Super
Bowl "the next season", or the winner of the  Points Championship of Racing, after they never pulled for
them the year before.  


<p><font color="blue">
There is no bandwagon. The latest GSO surveys showed that membership of A.A. is not
growing any more. If anything, it is now declining, and it will drop rapidly
when judges stop illegally, unconstitutionally sentencing people to A.A.
And it will really drop after a few patients win malpractice lawsuits against
treatment centers for shoving cult religion on them while calling it &quot;treatment
for a deadly disease&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#tools">giving you the tools that
you will need to maintain sobriety</a>&quot;.
</font><p>

I hope it makes you have grattitude, that you have taken so much time
to try to prevent someone that is almost dying from any sort of alcohol
related illnesses and trash ther hopes and dreams of having a good life
without alcohol.

<p><font color="blue">
You are wrong, totally wrong. I do not trash people's hopes of having a happy life.
I warn them of the Hell that is to be found in cults like A.A.. They can then do
other things that will actually help them to recover,
rather than wasting their time on harmful cult dogma, like believing that they are
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; and inherently sinful, selfish, and defective,
and unable to ever recover.
<p>
I give people the good news that they can recover without a cult religion,
and that there are better alternatives, like SMART, SOS, WFS, or MFS.
<p>
And once again, you are displaying another standard cult characteristic:
Insistence that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way">Our way is THE ONLY WAY</a>&quot;</font>.
A.A. is not the only way to recover, and if it disappeared off of the face of the
Earth tomorrow, alcoholics would still have plenty of ways to recover, starting
with
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental"><i>Do It Yourself</i></a>.
</font><p>

A good life don't mean that one gets on their hands and knees and
preaches on a high rock.  It means that in a life of alcohol and isolation, we can overcome the ways of
our past and learn how to make friendships with the people of the same illness in our own hometowns.  

But you have no where to go to share your experience, stregnth and hope
with anyone else.  People that don't idealize with the problem of
addiction don't understand, and don't want to hear about it. 


<p><font color="blue">
That doesn't sound too bad, but it is still cultish. Why not just make friends with
everybody in general, whether they are an alcoholic or not?
Are you really so afraid that normal people won't understand?
That is, you know, just another standard cult characteristic:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Only another cult member understands.&quot;</i></font>

</font><p>

What you haven't provided is an alternative to the program of AA.

<p><font color="blue">
Ah yes, there it is:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">
The standard A.A. cult dodge</a>:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;You can't criticize our
voodoo medicine unless you have a foolproof program of your own to offer as an
alternative.&quot;</i></font><br>
We've been over this before, in previous letters. That is bogus logic &#8212;
If someone is selling witchcraft as a cure for AIDS, I can criticize him and his
potentially-fatal quack medicine without
having a working cure for AIDS to offer as an alternative to the witchcraft.
<p>
Furthermore, I have provided an alternative. We have discussed that repeatedly.
Read
<a href="orange-letters.html#alternative">the previous letters</a>.
</font><p>

Other than doing it on your own and
criticising everything in your way everyday.
I am one of these people that think that a highlighter
marker is a waste of time, the whole dang book is important.
  Not just one sentence.  But one looking
for lies, has to take it out of text and pinch it into their own thinking.
  So they hash and hash,
wetting the pages with the &quot;dye of inconfidence and incompatance&quot;.  

<p><font color="blue">
The whole dang book is a carefully crafted pack of lies.
I merely highlight
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">the most outrageous ones</a>.<br>
<p>
Besides, at the beginning of this letter you wrote,
<font color="#4f007f"><b>
&quot;There is very little that Bill W. had to do with any of us staying
sober as fars as docterine.&quot;</b></font> [<i>sic.</i>]<br>
Now you are telling me that you consider <i>his whole book</i>
to be &quot;important&quot;? Which is it?
</font><p>

Making one try to see how because
brown liquor made that person puke green stuff, will make it alright for everyone to drink white liquor;
 that is the old ways of Alcoholic thinking.

<p><font color="blue">
What on earth is that gibberish supposed to mean? You are becoming incoherent.
</font><p>
 
 Thus is so for one not able to keep his opinion to himself.

<p><font color="blue">
This is the United States of America, not some dictatorship like Iraq, isn't it?
We have Freedom Of Speech and Freedom Of The Press here, and are not
required to keep our opinions to ourselves.
In fact, democracy will not work if we do.
<p>
Furthermore, criticizing evil cults is a good thing to do. Ask any survivor of
Scientology, the Hari Krishnas, or the Moonies. Heck, ask any survivor of Alcoholics
Anonymous.
</font><p>

But much like you are an asshole for printing this website up,
I have a belly button also, and
we both are still sick...  I Agree to be disagreeable.

<p><font color="blue">
You may still be sick, but I recovered.
<p>
Habitually declaring yourself to be
sick is yet another standard cult characteristic &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think">Members cannot

</font>
and

Subject: Qualifications<br>

<p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt; Dear Sir/Madame;
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what your academic background is and what training
&gt;&gt; you have
&gt;&gt; received in statistics? Do you you what a &quot;p&quot; value is? Or
&gt;&gt; an &quot;n&quot; value.
&gt;&gt; Just curious. Where did you receive your degrees, and in what
&gt;&gt; discliplines.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; We just need to know whether or not we can take the information pn
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; website into serious consideration, or not.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Thank you
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Stuart Hyderman BPHE MSc MD
</pre>

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hello Stuart,
<p>

Who is &quot;we&quot;? Do you have fleas or something?
<p>

I see that you grew a whole bunch of new initials after your name,
things you didn't have last month or last year. Does &quot;MD&quot; stand
for Mendelevium or Muscular Distropy?
<p>

If you were a Doctor, or even a medical student, or even just 
a fair science student, you would know that you do not question
journalists about scientific reports that they report about.
You go straight to the source, and question the doctor or
scientist who did the study and wrote the paper.
<p>

Nevertheless, I shall answer your question.
<p>
You must have been reading the results from Dr. Walsh et. al.
in the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">
<i>The Effectiveness Of The Twelve Step treatment</i></a>,
because that is the only place on my web site where
I mention p values.
<p>

First, the easy one: When Dr. Walsh mentions n values in
her paper, that is just the number of patients in the sample.
(Although I don't see where you are reading &quot;n values&quot;, because
none of my quotes from Walsh include the term. Perhaps you
were looking at Brandsma, who used the term the same way.)
<p>

<a name="p_values"> </a>
A p-value is a measure of confidence in a statistical hypothesis.
Specifically, a P value is the smallest significance level at
which a null hypothesis may be rejected.
<p>

Several cutoff points can be used for P values. Typical cutoff
values are (where Ho = the null hypothesis):
<p>

P value &gt; 0.1 &#8212; little evidence against Ho.<br>
0.05 &lt; P value &lt;= 0.1 &#8212; some evidence against Ho.<br>
0.01 &lt; P value &lt;= 0.05 &#8212; moderate evidence against Ho.<br>
0.001 &lt; P value &lt;= 0.01 &#8212; strong evidence against Ho.<br>
P value &lt; 0.0001 &#8212; very strong evidence against Ho.<br>
<p>

In her paper, Dr. Walsh did not explain how she calculated the
p-values, but it appears to me that she was simply using the
probability that any particular values were due to either
chance or dishonesty as the null hypothesis, and the alternative
hypothesis is that the differences in values between the groups
were statistically significant. Thus, the lower the p-value,
the greater the confidence we can have in the numbers.
<p>

I get that particularly from the very low p-value for
the number of patients requiring additional hospitalization
in the table of cocaine users' outcomes. People can
lie about occasional cocaine use or drinking, but it's
impossible to hide the hospitalizations when the doctors have
access to the medical records.
<p>

So Dr. Walsh gives p-values that range from 0.020 for &quot;any
drinking&quot; to 0.001 for &quot;additional hospitalization&quot;.
<p>

And likewise, &quot;Additional inpatient treatment was required
significantly more often (P&lt;0.0001) by the AA group (63 percent)
and the choice group (38 percent) than by the subjects assigned
to initial treatment in the hospital (23 percent).&quot;
<p>

Such a very low p-value as 0.0001 is &quot;very strong evidence&quot;.
That is what you would expect when you can see the
undeniable evidence of hospitalization and when the difference
between 63 percent and 23 percent is so large that it cannot
possibly be due to random chance.
<p>

At least, that's how I read it. I would email her and ask
her if I knew her email address, but I don't.
<p>

As far as credentials and education is concerned, it isn't
mine that you need to be examining. You shouldn't believe me,
you should believe the doctors and other experts whom I quote.
They are the scientists and researchers and doctors who
are doing the research and creating the evidence.
I am merely acting as a journalist. The major requirement
for that job is integrity, honesty, and accuracy, for which
no degrees are given. The only way I can suggest for you
to figure out whether you can trust me there is to pick
a few references and citations at random, and verify them
for yourself. See for yourself whether I quoted truthfully
and accurately.

letter 2 from Stuart:<br>

<p>
Dear Sir/Madame;
<p>                                                                                           
I cannot take you seriously, based on the extreme defensiveness in
your
answer. Nonetheless, thank you for your reply. I see that you have no
qualifications (at least none mentioned) in the field of the
treatment of
alcoholism. I am curious about one thing however. Why do you spend so
much
effort in badmouthing someone else's ideas, however inane they may or
may
not be?
I really can't think of a more complete and utter waste...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Take me seriously? Whom do you think you are kidding?<br>

Third letter from Stuart,<br>
Thursday, August 07, 2003
<p>                                                                                           
I use some of my qualifications at my discretion, depending om with
whom I
am conversing. I am sorting through some information. You website
actually
interests me, and still may refer to it.
I do notice you replied publically to a private enquiry.
<p>

&gt; Do you really expect me to take *you* seriously?
<p>

IIRC, Stuart IS a medical doctor.  He may very well know more than Harvard

[and I answered]<p>

&quot;Stuart&quot; claims to be:<br>

Stuart Hyderman BPHE MSc MD<br>

<p>
Moonraker says:<br>
&gt; IIRC, Stuart IS a medical doctor.  He may very well know more than Harvard<br>

<p>

So I asked (and got no answer for):
<p>

What is his last name?<br>
For that matter, what is his first name?<br>
&quot;stuart&quot; or &quot;fred&quot;? Why is his email &quot;fred@outerspace.jetsons&quot; ?<br>
<p>

Is this stuart any relation to the other stuart who posts here,
who also claims to be a doctor, Stuart Hyderman, hyderman@telusplanet.net ?
<p>

Where did he graduate from medical school?<br>
In which states is he licensed to practice medicine?<br>
What papers has he had published, and where?<br>
Where does he practice medicine?<br>
What experience does he have in treating alcoholism?<br>
<p>

What makes you say that he may know more than Harvard on some issues?
<p>

Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>

=====================================================
<p>

I did a search of the American Medical Association's database
of doctors. They never heard of any Dr. Stuart Hyderman, even
though they list both AMA members and non-members.
<p>

An internet search found only a &quot;Stuart Hyderman, doctor
of chiropractic&quot;, in Canada. The letters for that are
&quot;DC&quot;, not &quot;MD&quot;.
<p>

A search of health and medical databases of articles and
publications found no papers by any Dr. Stuart Hyderman.
<p>

Anybody have an explanation for these curious facts?
<p>

And what is &quot;BPHE&quot;, and who grants it?

I'd say they were non-facts. It's only curious to you because you are
hunting for some silly little piece of &quot;evidence&quot; to add to
your conspiracy theory.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Nope, not much of a conspiracy. Probably just a couple
of stupid teenage kids who think that it is terribly funny
to lie and claim to be a real doctor, and dispense quack
medical advice and cult religion, while alcoholism kills
100,000 Americans per year.

Hello Agent Orange,

<p>
I ran across your web site this a.m. when I decided to find what Bob 
Earll was up to these days. He was one of my favorite AA speakers, in my 
opinion he spoke &quot;his truth&quot; and didn't care what anyone
thought.  

<p>
 I've been sober 17 years and left AA after 3.  I couldn't agree with 
you more!  I left AA to save my life and to get a life!

<p>
Keep up the great work, thank God for your web site!

<p>
Karen in Seattle
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, Karen,
<p>
Thanks for the kind remarks. I'm glad that somebody appreciates
the work.
<p>
Have a good day, and congratulations on your sobriety.

Dear Mr Orange,
<p>
 
I stumbled on your site today and am so glad I did &#8212; it shed light on my own 
experiences with AA. Without boring you with my own story, I am happily into my 
third week of sobriety having concluded that the only way forward is to look to 
myself and my own strength and determination to overcome this particular problem 
as indeed I have to confront all other problems. Wouldn't it be cool if I could 
turn over my debt problems to a higher power for example or sit with other bad 
debtors wallowing in my problems until they miraculously disappeared! If only.
<p>
 
I regret I first went to AA in 1995 and while I had reservations my befuddled 
state stopped me devoting serious time to analysing what was really going on &#8212; a 
drowning man will clutch at a straw. Well, its 2003 now and I am still here, 
without the aid of a higher power &#8212; I still have the potential to destroy myself 
the same as anyone else but at the moment I choose not to.
<p>
<a name="fire_alcoholic"> </a> 
Mr orange it may interest you to hear that my employer rang an AA helpline here 
in the UK out of the best of motives with me listening in &#8212; a conference call 
with God if you like! I was stunned to hear the AA volunteer advising my 
employer to give me my marching orders so that I would wake up and see sense... 
and giving this advice without any knowledge of me, my circumstances or my 
desire or not to stop drinking! But this woman felt that our shared affliction 
gave her the right to play God with my career, the one thing I was desperately 
holding onto that morning. Fortunately my employer is a good man and did not 
follow her fanatical advice. I conclude that AA felt that if I was stripped of 
my job then I would be a more willing recruit for their cult.
<p>
 
Another anecdote from a call I made today to AA. Incidentally if you wonder why 
I still call these people it is because I confess to a morbid curiosity with 
what this appalling organisation is up to now that I have reached my own 
solutions and returned myself to sanity in my own way.
<p>
 
I called the helpline today and asked the simple question&#8212;<br>
Q: I am finding it 
difficult to concentrate on my job or indeed to focus on anything in the last 
week or so &#8212; is this part of withdrawal and if so what can I do about it?
<p>
 
Answer: Go to a meeting (surprise surprise) to which I asked what possible way 
can going to a meeting help me with physical or psychological withdrawal from 
alcohol?
<p>
 
More disturbing was the way the volunteer insisted vehemently that my efforts to 
give up alcohol were doomed unless I did it his way. This was all the more 
galling when I believe that this time I really have discovered the secret &#8212;  that 
it is a simple one step solution &#8212;  do not drink alcohol &#8212;  period. I didn't bother 
arguing because YOU CANNOT ARGUE WITH FANATICS.
<p>
 
I won't go on as I think you and I are on the same wavelength &#8212; but it greatly 
disturbs me that employers, wives, parents and sufferers are referred to these 
appalling people when in dire need of proper professional help &#8212; and a PROBLEM 
WHICH I INSTINCTIVELY BELIEVE TO BE CURABLE IS MISDIAGNOSED AND MISTREATED.
<p>
 
As for 'what you see and hear here stays here' &#8212; in other words the anonymity of 
the sufferer &#8212; my own reflection on this is that it is impossible to trust people 
with your innermost secrets &#8212; because 99.999999% of people will pass on the 
interesting titbit of gossip to someone else even though you trusted them with 
your darkest secret  &#8212; and this I would apply to my closest friends, family, 
doctors anyone. I trust nobody &#8212; if I don't want stuff to be common knowledge I 
keep it to myself &#8212; period.
<p>
 
Keep writing your views &#8212; people need proper answers to what is a difficult 
problem &#8212; they also need a believable strategy for survival not a load of mumbo 
jumbo.
<p>

 
Thank you for helping me today and reaffirming what I myself have come to 
realise &#8212; that I am the master of my own destiny and that that is really that. 
Wasn't it ever thus?
<p>
 
Kind regards,
<p>
 
John M.
<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello John,

<p>
Thanks for a great letter. You make a lot of good points.<br>
Oh, and thanks for all of the complements, too.
<p>
<a name="solution2"> </a>
The positive stuff first &#8212;  Yes, you are the master of your
destiny. Believing that has been a real life-saver for me.
Believing that I could just quit drinking and manage my own
life made it unnecessary for me to buy into a cultish
quack medicine cure.

<p>
And you mentioned looking for rational or common-sense help.
I like SMART (Self Management and Recovery Training) myself;
they dispense a lot of sane information.
<br>
(See the Top 10 reading list for Dr. Albert Ellis' book,
<a href="orange-top10.html#Ellis">
<b><i>When AA Doesn't Work for You, Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol</i></b></a>.)
<p>
(But I don't want to
slight SOS, MFS, WFS, or LifeRing. I just haven't been to
any of their meetings.) And although I mention SMART, and like
SMART, and go to SMART meetings, I still
basically got sober by my own efforts. I didn't even learn about
the existence of SMART until I had 4 or 5 months of sobriety.
<p>
I don't know if there are any SMART groups in the U.K.;
perhaps someone will start some.
<p>
And you mention the <i>&quot;Do not drink alcohol &#8212; period&quot;</i>
program for sobriety.
Yeh, I really like that line. I swiped it from
<a href="orange-Cult_Called_AA.html">Paul Roasberry</a> --<br>
<font color="black">
<i>'Try the "one-step" program, instead: just stop drinking.
Believe me: you can do it.'</i>
</font>

<p>
And somehow, I am not totally surprised by the A.A. &quot;helper&quot;
who recommended that you be fired. That is just so typical
of A.A. sponsors who feel entitled to hurt people in order
to help them.
<i>&quot;We are doing it for your own good.&quot;</i>

<p>
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Lemanski">
A study that I was reading about recently</a> wanted to see
whether A.A. really &quot;restored people to sanity&quot; and made them
&quot;happily and usefully whole&quot;, like Bill Wilson said.
It didn't.
The authors found that 54%
of the A.A. members examined (which included people with
as much as 9 years of sobriety in A.A.), were noticeably mentally
ill &#8212; &quot;Overtly Disturbed&quot; &#8212; all the way up to psychotic.
(Even more were maladjusted; only about 10% could be
called healthy.)

So when you call an A.A. hotline, you run a great risk
of getting advice from someone who is nuts.
You might as well flip a coin to decide whether to call A.A.
or the local mental hospital's inmates for some helpful advice...
<p>
Then there is of course the all-too-common arrogant attitude
that someone who was suicidally drinking himself to death suddenly
becomes the most wise and immensely knowledgeable person around
from just a year or two of going
to A.A. meetings, and is now completely qualified to act as a drug
and alcohol counselor and dispense advice in critical
life-or-death matters.
<p>
Well, as Sportin' Life sang in <i>Porgy and Bess</i>,
&quot;It ain't necessarily so...&quot;

<p>
And the way that the A.A. volunteer was so ready to cause you the
pain of loss of job and career reminds me that there is a noticeable
and disturbing thread of sadism and masochism running through
Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; A member gets smacked by his sponsor,
so he goes and beats up on his own newcomer sponsees, &quot;for their
own good, of course.&quot;
<p>
<a name="lash"> </a>
Bill Wilson constantly raved brutal fascistic things like,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Why all this insistence that every A.A. member must hit bottom first?
The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the A.A.
program unless they have hit bottom. For practicing A.A.'s remaining
eleven Steps means the adoption of attitudes and actions that almost
no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking. Who wishes to
be rigorously honest and tolerant?
Who wants to confess his faults to another and make restitution for
harm done? Who cares anything about a Higher Power, let alone
meditation and prayer? Who wants to sacrifice time and energy in
trying to carry A.A.'s message to the next sufferer? No, the average
alcoholic, self-centered in the extreme, doesn't care for this
prospect &#8212; unless he has to do these things in order to stay
alive himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Under the lash of alcoholism, we are driven to A.A., and there
we discover the fatal nature of our situation.
Then, and only then, do we become as open-minded to conviction and
as willing to listen as the dying can be.</font><br>

Recently, I was reading an A.A. book of daily meditations,
and stumbled across this item:

and emotional turmoil before serenity.</i><br>

</blockquote>
<p>
I love spending time in my garden feeding and pruning my beautiful
flowers. One day, as I was busily snipping away, a neighbor stopped
by. She commented, &quot;Oh! Your plants are so beautiful, it seems such
a shame to cut them back.&quot;
I replied, &quot;I know how you feel, but the excess must be removed so they
can grow stronger and healthier.&quot;
Later I thought that perhaps my plants feel pain, but God and I
know that it's part of the plan and I've seen the results.
I was quickly reminded of my precious A.A. program and how we all
grow through pain.
I ask God to prune me when it's time, so I can grow.<br>

<p>
So, apparently, that A.A. volunteer and God knew that it was time for you
to be pruned of your job and career so that you could grow more beautiful
in A.A. later...

<p>
Oh, and while we are at it, they also say that you must conform to the A.A.
way (no surprise there):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<p>
<center>
CONFORMING TO THE A.A. WAY

<p>
<blockquote>
<i>We obey A.A.'s Steps and Traditions because we really want
them for ourselves. It is no longer a question of good or evil;
we conform because we genuinely want to conform. Such is our
process of growth in unity and function. Such is the evidence
of God's grace and love among us.</i><br>
A.A. COMES OF AGE, p. 106
</blockquote>
<p>

It is fun to watch myself grow in A.A. I fought conformity to
A.A. principles from the moment I entered, but I learned from
the pain of my belligerence that, in choosing to live the
A.A. way of life, I opened myself to God's grace and love.
Then I began to know the full meaning of being a member of
Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>

<p>
And you mentioned that you can't argue with a fanatic.
Brother, is that ever true. I occasionally carry on debates with some of the
true believers in newsgroups like <i>alt.recovery.from-12-steps</i>
and <i>alt.recovery.addiction.alcoholism</i>.
The true believers have blinders on; they just don't want to know the truth
&#8212; that is one of the hallmarks of cult members.
It just doesn't matter what you
say or how well you prove a point; they won't see it; they refuse to
see it.
I figure that it is totally useless to try to teach them anything, but
more reasonable people who read the on-going
debates may benefit by learning something.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway, and thanks again for the letter.
And hang in there with your sobriety. You can do it.

<a name="seven_rehabs"> </a>

From: Rosanna<br>
Date: Wed, 10 Sep 2003
<p>

Hi Orange
 
<p>
Thank you for the most honest answers to all my questions I have had for a long 
time and no treatment centre was able to answer any of my questions but you 
have, and honestly too.
 
<p>
My best friend is addicted to heroin. The first rehab, we went to the first 
question, the therapist asks me,  &quot;What is your relationship with him&quot;, I tell 
them he is my best friend whom I love dearly and is in need of help, then I get 
interrogated for 3 hours as to whether I do drugs or not.  Then it is time to 
pay, then I pay for the programme, pay up front is required or no admission 
allowed. I paid out of my own personal pocket as he had no medical insurance.   
<p>
This is all done with friendliness and big smiles,
&quot;Let this be a new beginning.&quot;
<p>
Now the patient will be checked in.
&quot;Please say good bye, and no contact allowed 
for a period of 3 weeks. Please go to the family meetings provided by
the clinic for family, friends, etc.&quot;
<p>

Wow!!!! I leave feeling very positive that this will work.
By the way, the programme is based on the Betty Ford Clinic.
<p>
Now comes the 
fun and games. The friendliness disappears and any interference from me gets 
rebuked very rudely.
&quot;Please, you must stand back now and let us do our work.&quot;
<p>
In the 
car, when I left, the first thing that went through my mind was,
&quot;Hell, he is not a patient, but a client.&quot;
That was my PHD in common sense speaking to me. My gut 
feeling says, &quot;Something does not make sense here, but let's see
what happens.&quot;
 
<p>
I go to the family meetings. I get handed a piece of paper and have to pay to 
enter the room. I pay. I read the paper.
It says that I am powerless and unmanagable, 
and must surrender. Also I have a disease, addiction is a family disease, this 
disease I have is caring.
This terrible incurable disease is called &quot;codependency&quot;.
<p>
My friend also has a disease which is incurable, progressive, just like cancer 
etc.

<p>
Wow!!! This came as a shock &#8212; diseased.
Is this contagious, this disease? 
They answer &quot;Yes, if you do not follow the Steps.&quot;
<p>
At first, it made no sense, 
sick, a patient, I am sick.
Sick from what? as I feel pretty healthy and am of 
sound mind and thinking...
<p>
Then, the more I listened, the picture became clearer, 
this is the sisterhood of the AA cult speaking.
&quot;Put them out in the street; Let go Let God;
Your recovery comes first.&quot;
Recovery from what sickness? I am not sick.
 
<p>
So my friend gets thrown out of the rehab No.1, before the programme
treatment was finished, but they did not refund my money, because he was
allowed to came back after 72 hours.
Now I never brought him back after
72 hours, because these smucks knew he would relapse, and therefore
their cash register gets full and their pay 
cheques are guaranteed at the end of the month.
Now, the service I received after he was admitted was, this therapist
tried to control me and tell me what to do.
Take note: This happened after the receipt was written out, 
not before. Now my friend did relapse the minute he was thrown out.
<p>
 
Treatment No. 2, the same as above &#8212; pay up.
Once paid, it's &quot;Back off please, basically shut up and let us do
our work.
Go to the family meetings, you need to grow.&quot;
Grow up from what? I am an adult, in fact a very mature adult.

<p>
So we continue 
and now we are at rehab No.7. Note: all 6 rehabs were 12 step based.
The same psychobabble nonsense.
I sit in the sister Naranon meetings thinking, &quot;This is 
going to cure my friend?&quot;
How stupid when I think of it, now that I have a 
clearer picture. What an idiot I was.
<p>
They did brainwash me &#8212; I was going to 
give up on my friend, and I would have gone against everything I stand for, my 
values. It would have made me the most unhappy person to go against what I 
stand for, my principles, my values etc.
<p>
The cruelest trick of all is:
<b>&quot;BREAK UP, PUT UP, SHUT UP, MAKE UP.&quot;</b><br>
That is their motto. Despicable, absolutely 
despicable.
<p>
People are dying out there but the merry-go-round continues. 
Relapse, rehab, relapse, rehab, etc.
 
<p>
Rehab No 7. I ask, &quot;Are they 12 step based?&quot;
&quot;No, we work on the behaviour.&quot;
<p>
Okay, they say they will send an escort to fetch him. Wow!!! An escort,
never heard 
off something like that before. They arrive all smiles, friendly.
Please sign this acknowledgement of debt, and do not worry,
we will obtain a court order for 2 years so he can't run away.
I say goodbye to him.
<p>
I go visit after 4 weeks, 
but prior to visiting I speak to him on the phone and he says,
&quot;This is hell, 
please get me out of here.&quot;
&quot;All calls get monitered, by the way,&quot;
he says. &quot;Now I 
will get hell because I said these things about them.&quot;
I drive 500km to visit him.
I arrive and see his hair is all shaved off like some kind of animal. I 
inquire, and they answer that all is okay, he is doing fine,
the counselors are very friendly.
It gets explained to me, that I am dysfunctional because how can 
someone like me be attracted to someone like him.
I explained that he is my best 
friend and I know him very well and he is my friend.
They tell me no, he is self centered.
I must practice tough love.
<p>
Okay, My next meeting I get told I 
enable, so I am just as sick as him, and in need of treatment.
That was when I totally lost patience and said,
&quot;Listen, Mr. Therapist, if you for one minute think I 
am going to take your bait then you are so wrong.&quot;
<br>
Therapist says to me, &quot;I have 
you just where I want you and it is uncomfortable hey.&quot;
<br>
I nearly smacked him and I should have.
I said, &quot;Wait a minute, nobody has ever got me where they want me.&quot;
<br>
He says that it is the truth,
and my behaviour proves it, because why else
would I react this way then?
&quot;Let go, let God, for Your will be alone, let him go. 
He is a child, and needs to grow.&quot;
<p>
Take note, the AA cult was speaking here.
<p>
Now 
comes a catch 22. That acknowledgement of debt I signed while I was so 
distraught about my friend when they came to fetch him actually
guarantees them a payment of 1,000.00 $ per month for 2 years.
What they are doing is making sure 
that all their so-called patients, TC, stay for 2 years and
they will continously say they are not ready to go.
Now that justifies their tactic.
They have a social worker on their staff
and she obtains the court order which gives them 2 years of payment.
The court orders run for 2 years.
<p>
Also, they have group confessions, the groupie sessions.
The one other person whom I know there is 
a patient's fiance. She and I are best friends.
Her fiance will not be released because he supposedly
needs to confront his father,
and he now needs to tell this old man that it is all his 
fault that he is an addict, as it's in the genes.
My heart out goes out to both of 
them, as he does not want to confront his dad,
and now they are preventing his fiance from visiting due to the fact
that he has not confronted his dad. Despicable, unethical.
<p>
This therapist is a clinical psychologist by the way. Now, I started 
to question them, this must have made them nervous as now all of a sudden, my 
friend wants no contact with me, as apparently he has grown now.
The therapist 
says, &quot;You see, he has grown and has left you behind.&quot;
I asked the therapist in which has he grown,
has he taken responsibility for his actions and standing on 
his own two feet?
The answer was he has grown because he does not want to see 
you. Now all of a sudden my friend is hiding away from me in the boot camp 
because I am so persistent and do not give up. Now, is this brain washing or 
not?
<p>
If it were not for your web site I would have never known about all their 
games they play. The treatment is based on Synanon, so he is brainwashed but 
they get their 1,000.00 $ a month. After reading your site, I could not care 
jack shit about them.
I am going to fetch him before I end up going to his 
funeral. Let this be an eye opener to all.
They will sell you the same psychobabble nonsense over and over again.
Never will they say, &quot;Look, the treatment is not 
working, he is not responding, so let's try another option.&quot;
No, protocol says, this is what works. That is what they answer.  
 
<p>
I hope this story helps others out there.
Remember, they will turn your children against you by telling them that
it is your fault that they did drugs.
So be careful. The cult is active. People are dying out there.
 
<p>
I would love to hear what you think about my story. 

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi, Rosanna,

<p>
I think your story is very powerful and moving. Others should hear
your story, so I'm putting it up on the web site.
<p>
I do not have any magic answer for your friend. I wish I did.
As usual, I have to say that he will quit, really quit and stay
quit, when he wants to. What helps with that is to really look
at all of the down side of using, to increase the desire to quit.
I did a rap on cost-benefit analyses in an earlier letter,
<a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit">here</a>. He should
look at that. And I also mentioned the old Base Brain or Lizard
Brain
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
Recognizing him urging me to relapse helps me to avoid relapses.

<p>
Thanks for the letter, and have a good day.

<p>
I have had a drinking problem, and when benevolent people around me made
me remark it was growing into a dependency, I just decided to quit, and
since then I feel far better.  I especially realised alcohol was bad for
my willpower, and willpower I regained, up to the point that the time I
spent drinking I now spend doing yoga exercises and studies.

<p>
My abandoning alcohol had nothing to do with the AA.  Part of the reason
why I abandoned wine, which I loved so much, is that I am surrounded by
heavier drinkers than I was, and that the best service I can render them
is to show them one can have a more prolonged good time without
resorting to a bottle.
<p>
As you put it, AA is religion, and very bad religion indeed.
The God they pray to may be a very powerful being, but
is not the God Jesus Christ prayed to, nor the God Patanjali referred
to.  Even though they say one can rely upon God as they conceive Him, it
is a very specific conception of God that is touted upon them, a God
depriving the believer of all willpower.  It is not true [that] one must
crash and burn to recover from alcoholism.
<p>
If it is a disease, why doesn't
AA rely upon medical expertise first?  Why don't they treat the
problem psychiatrically rather than religiously?
<p>
  Second, one must not build a religious ideal around something negative.
It is a well-knowned fact of yoga and modern psychology that the more
you concentrate upon some evil &#8212;
maybe it's sin, maybe it's Satan, maybe it's alcoholism &#8212;
the more power you
give to the concept over yourself and in the world around you.  As a
sobriety-teaching system, Buddhism is quite superior, because the thing
insisted upon is a positive good, Nirvana.  Good forms of Christianity
concentrate upon Christ and bad forms upon Satan.
<p>
  One thing is sure
about alcoholism, the only step out of it is not considering one is
powerless before alcohol, but trusting oneself not to touch to the
harmful substance any longer.  Heaven helps those who help themselves.
I know many alcoholics who are so for their wanting to help others
without helping themselves first, and Bill was one of these as I am
informed by you: he died of tobacco, which I find more revolting as a
habit than alcohol.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi, F.M.
<p>
Thanks for a great letter. I couldn't agree with you more.
<p>
Oh, and while I don't know if tobacco addiction is more revolting
than alcohol addiction, it sure is deadlier: tobacco kills
430,000 U.S. citizens per year, while alcohol kills 100,000.
And I know that tobacco harmed me more than alcohol, if only
because I smoked for 35 years, and drank too much for a bit
less than 20. I thank God that I am now free of both of them.
<p>
Have a good day, and congratulations on your sobriety.

Subject: Your a fucking Idiot
<p>
Your have a problem with alcoholics living ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I have a problem with evil cults killing alcoholics
with quack medicine.
<p>
I assume from your question that you are under the misimpression
that Alcoholics Anonymous actually saves the lives of alcoholics.
<p>
Did you bother to read the file on the effectiveness of A.A.
as a cure for alcoholism? No, probably not. People who send short
letters of four-letter words usually don't read much of anything
before they start complaining.

<p>
Prof. George E. Vaillant, who is a member of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., as well as a doctor
and a professor of psychology, spent 8 years testing
A.A. treatment of alcoholics, and trying his best to make A.A. look
good, but in the end he had to admit that A.A. had not helped the
alcoholics at all, and on top of that, the A.A. program had an
&quot;appalling&quot; death rate, much higher than the other
treatment programs
that he studied. Of the 100 AA-treated alcoholics whom Vaillant
tracked for 8 years, 5 got sober, 29 got dead, and the other 66
kept on drinking.  And Vaillant wrote all of that in his book
<i>&quot;The Natural History of Alcoholism&quot;</i>. See:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a>
<p>
Also see Dr. Brandsma's test which revealed that A.A. grossly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma</a>

</font>
<p>

' &quot;Ego reduction&quot; ends up being a euphemism for destroying
one's 
self-respect, self-confidence, and ability to think independently.'
<p>
This was done by alcohol.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And A.A. does it some more, often to a much greater degree.
See:<br>
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-us_stupid_drunks.html</a>
<p>
And also look at Brandsma's work again. He found that
destroying people's egos had a negative effect &#8212; they drank to
get their egos back:<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;The 3-month follow-up indicated that AA members had
increased their binges and more often drank in order to feel
superior.&quot;

Subject: AA and You<br>
Date: Tue, 30 Sep 2003<br>

<p>
After &quot;plowing&quot; through your website I must admit it was interesting reading 
albeit flawed in part.
 
<p>
I have been in the program for 3 years and agree that AA's roots come from the 
bible. And I sometimes get upset with people who would deny that fact. It has 
been my experience that there are more people who do not know the roots of AA 
than there are those who deny AA's roots. 
<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry if it upsets you, but the truth is that the Twelve Steps of Bill Wilson
are not based on the Bible at all. They are based on the cult religion of
the notorious fascist Dr. Frank Buchman &#8212; his &quot;Oxford Groups&quot;. Even Bill
Wilson himself explicitly said so:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Language of the Heart</i>, William G. Wilson, page 298.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And in her book, Bill's wife Lois described how Bill wrote
the Twelve Steps for the <b>&quot;Big Book&quot;</b>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
By this time Bill was ready to start the fifth chapter,
&quot;How It Works.&quot; He was not feeling well, but
the writing
had to go on, so he took pad and pencil to bed with
him. How could he bring the program alive so that
those at a distance, reading the book, could apply it to
themselves and perhaps get well? He had to be very
explicit. The six Oxford Group principles that the
Fellowship had been using were not definite enough.
He must broaden and deepen their implications. He
relaxed and
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="newwin555">asked for guidance</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he finished writing and reread what he had
put down, he was quite pleased. Twelve principles had
developed &#8212; the Twelve Steps.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Lois Remembers</i>, Lois Wilson, Page 113<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Now I know some people, like Hemfelt, who put together the
&quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Serenity_Bible" target="newwin556">Serenity Bible</a>&quot;,
have pored over the Bible, looking for quotes that sound vaguely like
some of the fascist teachings of Frank Buchman (which Bill copied).
Then they imagine that such coincidences mean that the Steps are based
on the Bible.
But that is merely the same process as seeing butterflies or people's
faces in Rorschack ink blots. The stuff is obviously not really there.

<p>
In addition, the Twelve Steps are not
&quot;spiritual principles&quot;, they are cult practices. Their major
objective is recruiting and indoctrinating new cult members,
and turning them into true believers in the cult. That is what
Frank Buchman developed those practices for, and that is what
they still do.

<p>
By the way, Bill's statement was misleading in a couple of ways.
The &quot;early AAs&quot; did not find the
material for the Twelve Steps, Bill Wilson did.
Once again, he was trying to imply
that someone else helped to write those steps, which didn't happen.
Bill was also trying to imply that the early members of A.A. had searched
long and hard for something, anything, that would produce sobriety,
and the Twelve Steps were what they found. But that was just another one
of Bill's deceptions. The truth is that Bill Wilson just decided to shove
his strange Oxford Group religious beliefs on everybody else.
He wanted to recreate the Oxford Group cult so that he could profit
from it.
Wilson envisioned a string of for-profit hospitals that used an
inexpensive cult religion to treat alcoholism.
Half of the original A.A. members strongly objected to Bill's
dogmatic religiosity because they knew that it would drive alcoholics
away from the very group that was supposed to help them.

<p>
And Bill brought up the name of Sam Shoemaker as the leader of
the American branch of the cult, because he didn't want to
mention Frank Buchman, the real leader, whom a lot of people hated
for his praise of Adolf Hitler and pro-Nazi sympathies.

<p>
If you think that the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous have something
to do with the Bible, you should re-read two files:<br>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="newwin557">The Religious Roots of the Twelve Steps</a><br>
and<br>
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="newwin558">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>
</font>
 
<p>
The more important issue is that people ARE getting sobriety from
working the AA 
program and many of these people neither know the roots of AA nor deny them. 
<p>
One important point you fail to recognize is that people do not get sober 
because of what Bill Wilson was or wasn't. They get sober because they have 
found something they can believe in.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. People get sober because they decide to get sober.<br>
People quit drinking because they get sick and tired of being sick and tired.<br>
They realize that chronic drunkenness is going to kill
them, and they decide that they would rather live.
<p>
If you think that A.A. makes people get sober, then show me the data, please.<br>
Where did you get the idea that A.A. makes people get sober? (Besides some A.A. true
believers telling you that at a meeting...)<br>
What study, survey, or experiment showed that A.A. sobers up anybody?<br>
<p>
I have collected every study of the effectiveness of A.A. and 12-step treatment
that I could find anywhere, and the valid ones (of which there are not enough)
are in the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">The Effectiveness of the Twelve Steps</a>.

<p>
All of the fair unbiased honest tests show that A.A. does not work. Even one
of the leaders of A.A.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Prof. George Vaillant</a>,
who is a member of the Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Board of Trustees,
proved with his own 8-year-long test of A.A. treatment of alcoholics
that A.A. does not work at all. It produced zero improvement in the
alcoholics.
<p>
You are being fooled by appearances. Just because you can collect a dozen or
a hundred sober people and put them in a room does not mean that the room or
the meeting made them get sober. Even when they sober up after their first A.A.
meeting, it <i>still</i> does not prove that A.A. somehow caused them to get sober.
What about the great numbers of other people who relapse after some A.A. meetings?
Did the A.A. meetings cause them to relapse and drink alcohol?
A.A. cannot fairly claim the credit for one small part of the crowd
quitting drinking while disavowing any responsibility for all of the
rest of the people who don't quit.
Either the program works or it doesn't.

<p>
And I know about the argument,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, they didn't follow the program right.
It's their fault that they are still drinking.
 The program will work if they work it right.&quot;<br>
</font>
But that is a bogus argument. I can just as logically proclaim
that I have a foolproof, never-fails program:<br>
Rule One is QUIT DRINKING AND NEVER DRINK AGAIN.<br>
There are no other rules.<br>
If someone doesn't quit drinking, then he isn't thoroughly following
my simple program which never fails if people follow it thoroughly.
<p>
That is, of course, a bunch of baloney.

<p>
And the question you are totally ignoring is: &quot;How many of those newcomers
who quit drinking would have quit anyway, without A.A.?&quot; Usually, the answer
is, &quot;All of them.&quot; A.A. and N.A. just claim all of the credit for the people
who were going to quit anyway, while denying any responsibility
for all of those other people who don't quit drinking and doping.
That is dishonest and phony.

<p>
Even when people swear that the A.A. meetings made them get sober, that is
worthless evidence. People are unfortunately easily fooled by quack medicine.<br>
Read Doctor Barry Beyerstein's rap about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#quack_testimonials">annecdotal
evidence and quack medicine</a>.<br>
Also read Doctor David Duncan's observations on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Duncans_story">quack doctors and quack medicine</a>.<br>
Many people who get completely ineffective quack medicine will still swear that it
is great medicine and that it healed them.
<p>
Every cult has its true believers who grandly claim that the cult gave them spirituality,
or sanity, or special powers, or a guaranteed ticket to Heaven, or sobriety,
or something. They are sure that their cult is God's special gift to mankind.
They are wrong.
<p>
&quot;Having something to believe in&quot;, as you call it,
is just as worthless as believing that the Earth is flat. The truth is what matters,
and the truth is that as a therapy program to sober up alcoholics, Alcoholics
Anonymous is a total failure. But as a cult religion, A.A. is a great success.
</font>
 
<p>
I would agree that some folks maintain that 
Bill was divinely inspired when he wrote the big book. I am not one of those 
people. Bill was a terrible writer but he was very good a plagiarizing.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that you have right.
</font>
 
<p>
The big book is as good or as bad as a person wants to make it. But for dealing 
specifically with alcoholism and learning to live a life free of alcohol it is 
no different than any of the thousand other self improvment books that flood the 
market each year. 
 
<p>
Mickey
<p>
<p>
<font color="blue">
The Big Book is insane nonsense. You can't make it &quot;good&quot;.
Trying to make something good out of it is like
trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
The <i>Big Book</i> contains large amounts of insane misinformation and
grandiose delusions.
<p>
Read
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">The Funny Spirituality of Bill Wilson
and A.A.</a>
<p>
<a name="McLuhan"> </a>
The idea that you can make the <i>Big Book</i> good or bad is another logical
fallacy, a fallacy that Marshall McLuhan dispensed with 35 years ago.
He pointed out that you cannot say,
<font color="black">
&quot;Things are neither good nor bad.
It is the use to which you put them that counts.&quot;</font>
McLuhan stated that things have inherent effects. It is insane to declare,
<font color="black">
&quot;Hydrogen bombs are neither good nor bad. It is the use that you put them
to that counts.&quot;
</font>
Obviously, hydrogen bombs inherently have a certain effect.
Whether they are dropped on cities or not, they still terrorize people.
They change the world just by their existence. (And as terrorists get closer and
closer to having some nuclear warheads, they will really change the world.)
<p>
Likewise, the <i>Big Book</i> inherently misinforms people about alcoholism,
and causes alcoholics to die. One of Prof. Vaillant's big discoveries in his test
of A.A. was that A.A. actually raised the death rate in alcoholics, rather than
lowered it.

<p>
And the <i>Big Book</i> is very different from a lot of other self-help books.
The <i>Big Book</i> pushes
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">a strange old cult religion</a>,
and says that you will die unless you believe in
Bill Wilson's crazy beliefs. And then Bill says that you must
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">abandon human intelligence and Reason,
and just &quot;have faith&quot;</a>
(<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik">in Bill's chosen beliefs</a>).
That is not a self-help program, that is a cult religion.
 
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
