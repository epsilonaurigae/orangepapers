Subject:  	3 things AA does usefully<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I've written before but I just wanted to throw out 3 possible &quot;positive&quot; aspects of
AA (borrowing off of your &quot;What's Good?&quot; section):

<p>
 &#8212; Something to do.<br>
 &#8212; Somewhere to go.<br>
 &#8212; Someone to talk to.<br>

<p>
Of course all these 3 things could be better served by finding other activities to
fill your life with meaning but at least in the beginning (first year or so) when a
recovering alcoholic is looking for something to fill the vacuum if there are
relatively benevolent low-pressure groups then it can fill this niche. However after
then the training wheels should come off and at that point that person should be
looking to move on with their life. The problem is so many groups are inherently
high-pressure, step-obsessed, &quot;program-centric&quot; groups and without experience you
wouldn't know the difference until you're in there for a while, by that time getting
fully indoctrinated.

<p>
Thanks for all your work and hope the goslings are well this spring.

<p>
Mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
Yes, I have to agree with that. Some companionship and moral support can be very helpful
in the first year  &#8212;  <i>provided</i> that it doesn't come at the price of also getting
indoctrination in cult religion and gross misinformation about alcohol abuse and addiction.
<p>
Fortunately, the sane recovery groups are growing and proliferating.
<p>
And of course, how empty must someone's life be for him to say, &quot;I'm bored. I need something to do. I know,
I'll go join a cult religion and drink some koolaid. Or maybe overdose on barbiturates so that I
can hitch a ride on an invisible flying saucer that is hiding behind a comet.&quot;
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Mary sent you a message.

<p>
&quot;Hi, thanks for your really informative website.  I have been trying to get sober in
AA for 16 years but it has never worked and I have such low self esteem now. I
stopped going to meetings a week ago and have been trying moderation which is
working fine at the moment, but if it doesn't I will stop altogether, which I have
always been able to do.  But I keep hearing their voices in my head.  I wish I'd
never gone in the first place, I was concerned because I used alcohol when I was
under stress at work, but I got sucked into all the bullshit and then when I drank I
binged &#8212; something I never did before I started going. My husband and adult children
all say they don't think I'm an alcoholic and my husband says whenever I go to AA it
causes so much trouble at home as they tell me to leave him as he drinks.  The last
16 years I have been on a go to AA &#8212; binge &#8212; go back to AA cycle.   Do you know
where I can get some information about de-programming my brain?  I feel so angry at
myself for believing all the crap they told me! And now I feel I am going mad with
all the AA stuff going round in my head.   Thanks again for putting the truth out
there.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mary,
<p>
Thanks for the message and the compliments. And I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
I'm especially glad to hear that you are resisting the indoctrination, and not allowing them
to destroy your marriage. Those fools are downright vicious.

<p>
First off, please do not be down on yourself, and criticize yourself for believing the
stuff that A.A. shoved on you. You were just a babe in the woods, up against some of the most
skilled cult religion recruiters and indoctrinators in the world. A.A. has 75 years of experience
in fooling people with their propaganda, and they even had a head start. They recycled
<a href="orange-rroot120.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion tricks and dogma and beliefs</a>,
and he in turn recycled the dogma and slogans and tricks of those evangelists who were
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Wrights_material" target="_blank">his mentors</a>, and they
got it from others before them.
Those old cult religion salesmen had a couple of centuries of advantage over you.
They have had centuries of practice and time to refine their mind-bending tactics before you
innocently wandered in their door.
It was never a fair fight.

<p>
It is entirely possible that you are not an alcoholic and never were. If you can moderate, then
good for you. And like you said, if you cannot moderate, then just quit altogether.

<p>
The problem of binge drinking after going to A.A. is a real problem. That is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">what Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma found</a>
in his study of A.A.: The people who got A.A. did <i>five times</i> as much binge drinking
as other people who got no &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;help&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;,
and the A.A.-indoctrinated people did <i>nine times</i> as much binge drinking as
other people who got Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
Teaching people that they are <i>powerless over alcohol</i> becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.
<p>
It will take some time to get the A.A. garbage cleared out of your head. Heck, I'm still catching
myself thinking a Stepper thought now and then, forgetting what I know for a moment and accepting a Stepper assumption,
even though I only went to A.A. for 3 months, and I know better. A.A. has been inserting their memes
into American society and popular thought for 75 years now too, so it's hard to get away from it.
<ul>
<li> &quot;Nobody can do it alone.&quot;
<li> &quot;You need a support group.&quot;
<li> &quot;You need a program.&quot;
<li> &quot;You need help from a Higher Power.&quot;
<li> &quot;People who depend on a Higher Power for their sobriety are more spiritual.&quot;
<li> &quot;He won't <i>really</i> start to recover until he hits bottom.&quot;
<li> &quot;We just want to freely give away what was freely given to us.&quot;
<li> &quot;Helping others keeps us sober.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
Remember the old Chinese saying, &quot;The longest journey begins with the first step.&quot; And also,
&quot;When you have taken the first step, the journey is half over.&quot;
And you have obviously taken the first step, and more.

<p>
May I recommend this web page?:
<a href="orange-deprogram.html" target="_blank">How To Deprogram Your Own Mind</a>.
There, I wrote down some ideas that I had on the subject. Now that isn't the end-all and be-all on
the subject, but it's a start.
<p>
Beyond that, just learning more about the dark side of A.A., and the real history of A.A.,
will help you to &quot;un-think&quot; it.
<p>
Also, you might like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160506144235/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>.
They teach some thought techniques that can help in deprogramming.
I already mentioned one technique in that web page on deprogramming your own mind &#8212; catching and
rejecting the irrational words like &quot;should, ought to, must, deserve, etc.&quot; that
push an unspoken value system.
But they have a few more techniques for detecting and rejecting irrational thoughts, like challenging them
with &quot;Says who? Where is it written? Is there any proof for that?&quot;
So you might like SMART. It can't hurt, and you could learn some useful tools.
(Note that SMART really does what A.A. only claims to do &#8212; give you some tools that will help
you to maintain sobriety.)

<p>
And on the subject of techniques to moderate or quit, this page points to a bunch of letters and
techniques on the subject:

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I recently borrowed an AA book from the local library. It is titled
&quot;Experience, Strength and Hope&quot; and it is a collection of 56 AA
stories that were in earlier editions of the Big Book but are not in
the present edition of the Big Book.

<p>
I have heard it said that about half of the sober alcoholic AA members
who got their their stories published in earlier editions of the Big
Book eventually returned to drinking and died drunk. Have you ever
read or heard anything about this?

<p>
Paul.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. I trust that you are doing well.
<p>
The answer to your question is a simple and resounding &quot;Yes&quot; on all counts.
That report comes from Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary.
&quot;Private secretary?&quot; Weren't Bill and Lois living in poverty, just struggling
to survive? Well no, not exactly. More like getting rich off of A.A. royalties,
living in a beautiful house in the country, driving a Cadillac car, and Bill was
supporting mistresses on the side, and Lois had a private secretary. (By the time of
her death, Lois was getting about $900,000 per year.)

<p>
Well anyway, here is what Francis Hartigan reported in his biography of Bill Wilson
(which he didn't write until many years after Lois died):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have to wonder why both the Wilsons and the Smiths did not simply give up.
Today the nation's best alcoholism treatment centers report success rates
ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent. During Bill's stay in Akron,
he and Bob calculated their success rate to be about 5 percent, and among
the few who seemed to catch on, not all of them were able to maintain
consistent sobriety. The first edition of AA's <i>Big Book</i>, published
in 1939, contains the personal recovery stories of many of AA's earliest
members. Some years later, Bill made notations in the first copy of the
book to come off the press, indicating which individuals portrayed therein
had stayed sober. A good 50 percent of them had not.<br>

some logical sense to put so much time and work into it. I won't mimic your attitude

Subject:  	Re: 12 steps for sane 'lunatics'<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Thanks for your reply. I found it extremely interesting.
Three of quick points.

<p>
Why on earth would you think that I would think that other people could
work miracles? What I learned from AA was that I was indeed relying far too
much on my own drunkard's ways of thinking and that I had to learn to seek
guidance from people who collectively know more than I do, and many of whom
know me quite well and are good at spotting dangeours ways of thinking that
I am prone to.  They are carefully selected and there are enough of them so
that I can get really good advice. And I have learned  that when there is
something like consensus, I should just do what they advice, even if I
don't want to. I don'rt pray to them I talk to them.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Hetu-Ahin,
<p>
I never said that you believed in miracles. I said that the 12 Steps require God to perform
a whole bunch of miracles in order for the 12 Steps to work.
<p>
Now if you want to write an essay explaining how you don't believe in God, and you don't
believe in miracles, and how
the 12 Steps cannot possibly work in a supernatural fashion, I'll gladly publish it.
<p>
The rest of your paragraph explains that you got counseling from someone whom you trust and consider wise.
Good. You can of course, find such people in other places than cult religion meeting rooms.

</font>
<p>
I think that those in AA who are out to convert atheists are overt about
it.  They say that you need some kind of supernatural HP to get sober. And
then they give you all this stuff about: take the group as your HP to start
with. Just to start with, because this will change. This is what BB says.
It isn't a secret. This goes along with: talk like a believer, act like a
believer, open your mind, be humble etc. A benevolent and overt  attempt at
indoctrination that sometimes works. Annoying. But not a con.
Then you have many theists who don't think that belief in a supernatural
HP is necessary. That's nearly all of the theists in my groups.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds like a fair assessment of the situation. The term that you avoided
using is, &quot;Bait and switch trick&quot;, which is what it is.
First you can believe in anything, including a rock or a tree, and then you should
just &quot;Fake It 'Till You Make It&quot;, but then you should really start to believe
in the Tyrant Upstairs who will give you miracles if you grovel enough.

</font>
<p>
Confusion arises with 'use 'God' to mean what you like'. It can mean use
'God' to mean Group of Drunks or whatever. Or it can mean use 'God' to talk
about God as you understand Him. The second is theistic: you are to talk
about God the all-powerful, but there is leeway in relation to how He is
conceived. The first is benign, though irritating and stupid. This
confusion now spreads across every use of the term 'God', including 'find
your own conception of God'.  People do get confused about this. But I
don't think that anyone trades on the confusion in order to indoctrinate,
by trying to plant the word in someone's mind by using the first
interpretation and then somehow cajoling then into theistic beliefs by
inculcating a concept of God via the second interpretation.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That &quot;confusion&quot; is at the heart of the deception and I'm sure that they do
&quot;trade on the confusion&quot;.
The 12 Steps are passed off as working technology  &#8212; the 12 Steps are supposedly
a set of things for someone to do to
make him quit drinking and stay sober. But to then declare that the single most important word
in the Steps  &#8212;  &quot;God&quot;  &#8212;  doesn't mean anything in particular is both dishonest and insane.
But that's what they say.

</font>
<p>
Remember  that 'God as we understood Him' comes from two people wirth
different agendas, not one person with a single con-job conversion agenda.
Confusion is what results, not a confidence trick, a device for
indoctrination.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I disagree. Bill Wilson was selling the crazy dogmatic Oxford Group religion as
a cure for &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<b><i>&quot;The only radical cure for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;</i></b>

Jim Burwell saw that Bill's fanaticism was going to drive away many of the alcoholics
whom A.A. was supposed to help. So Jim tried to get Bill to tone it down.
He didn't really succeed. Inserting two &quot;as we understood Him&quot; qualifiers did not
change the fact that the 12 Steps are Dr. Frank Buchman's cult recruiting and indoctrination practices.
<p>
The rest of it, the &quot;anything as your Higher Power&quot;, really is a confidence trick.
Here is how the <i>Serenity Bible</i> describes the con:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We may start out as agnostics. We may then come to view the group
or recovery process as our higher power, looking to other
people for strength. Gradually, we accept a vague notion of god,
which grows to a more specific monotheistic god.
We may even begin to pray to and dialogue with this god.
Eventually we come to know the one true God.<br>

</font>
<p>
On groups accepting atheists. In one group I go to there used to be a sign
up: 'Who are you to say that there is no 'God?'. I asked if the sign could
be taken down. We had two meetings to discuss. And it was voted down more
or less unanimously. The theists saw that it was inapprorpiate. Since then
the other two 'God' posters that were up have been taken down, I believe
because the theists want to make us atheists feel comfortable. And two nice
men who used to be AA fundies have completely changed their way of talking.
This week one of them pointedly used 'higher power' instead of 'God' and
drew my attention to this. The other one talked of how he had come to
believe in a creative intelligence whom he chose to call 'God, 'but

Dear Orange,

<p>
Here is a reply to yiur bait-and-switch game claim:

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
AA is a fellowship of men and women. It does not tell anyone anything. It
is not that kind of entity. AA has BB and 12 and 12. These tell you things
in the way a book tells you things. They have no power to make you do
anything at all. Official documents from GSO also count as AA written
material and they tell you things in the way written material does. These
also has no power to make anyone do anything. Individual members tell other
people things all the time. Some of what they tell people is consistent
with the books and official documents, much of it is not. AA plays no
games. As a fellowship it is far too disorganized to do anything that
sophisticated. All it does as a whole is help alcoholics, by providing
meetings, sponsors, written material some of which at least that they would
be well-advised to read. Prospective new members can read BB and 12 and 12.
If they did so they would then know what was on offer, and could avoid any
difficulty with anyone telling them anything problematic. There can then be
no first and then later. They can see how 'God' is used in BB and 12 and 12
for themselves.

Hello again, Hetu-Ahin,

Wow, you are really descending into denial now, and just parrotting the A.A. party line.

All it takes is one clever or insane or fanatical sponsor to play games on
newcomers' heads. And all it takes is one nutcase to set himself up as the leader of a new subcult.

Foisting the teachings of an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties on sick people

<p>
Avoid any difficulty with anybody? Go read
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_list" target="_blank">the horror stories</a>
again. People are routinely told to either believe and do what they are told, or else
<i>&quot;Go out and do some more research on the subject.&quot;</i>
In other words, relapse and die.
And lots of people have no choice in the matter. People are sentenced to A.A. by judges or &quot;treatment programs&quot;,
or E.A.P.s (Employee Assistance Programs), and those people had better &quot;get with the Program&quot;, or else they
suffer dire consequences.

<p>
No first and then later? Talk about ignoring reality.
A.A. is nothing but a huge mess of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch tricks</a>. Did you actually read them?
<p>
And there is nothing accidental about it. Bill described his deceptive selling of the Oxford Group religion this way:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little. They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts &#8212; absolute purity, absolute
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently
too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>

Hi Orange,

<p>
It appears H. Ketchum hasn't taken his arrest seriously. He was arrested 4 days ago
for not registering. I can't find the guidelines of how often or when Oregon sex
offenders need to register anywhere, regardless I'm sure there's plenty of time
given.

I've been to PAAC, back when it was on 12th st. for acupuncture and at their new
location for outpatient in '06 but that wasn't what did it entirely for me.
Believing in my own power and sensibility, doing things on my own path and time
approach and having gone through numerous trials and errors is what worked best for
me. Since then I have formed (and it's always evolving) my own theory of what
addiction is and how to remain separate from it. I did go to inpatient at NARA for 4
months at the end of '06. It was helpful to be removed entirely from the society I
had, and to be given my basic necessities respectively so I could start over. I was
so addicted physically I needed those things and didn't have family or other sources
that could offer that in a way I could actually end the addiction. It got to where I
lost my housing plus and was living in my truck, I couldn't reach out to family and
even lost contact with good old friends because I knew I was addicted. I haven't had
a beer in 6 years almost and am repulsed by the thought, I do drink a glass of wine
a few times a year but there's no sense in drinking to excess and definitely not
what I want. The information you have put together is amazing. I have viewed your
site a few times and still am searching through it, I plan on spreading the word
even more.

<p>
Have a good day,

Hello Christina,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
Thank you very much for the tip. That is news to me. I don't know how you found that, but
I'm glad that you did.
<p>
I was kind of wondering whatever happened to old Harry Ketchum. VINES erased
<a href="orange-letters154.html#Harry" target="_blank">his web page</a>
when he finished his probation last year (05/16/2011). I searched the Internet
for sex offender listings, but could not find him. Now I know why. He didn't register.
<p>
His appearance has really changed. I wouldn't have recognized him if I met him on the street.
He used to have short hair and was clean-shaven.

For those readers who don't know what all this means, in November of 2000 I was
sent to PAAC, the &quot;Portland
Alternative Addiction Center&quot; (also when it was at 12th &amp; Morrison),
for what they called outpatient treatment for alcoholism and/or drug addiction. It included
lots of acupuncture, which was supposed to &quot;reduce our cravings&quot;.
It was a total sham. A fanatical nutcase who yammered 12-Step slogans at us was our &quot;counselor&quot;.
That was Harry Ketchum.
The Oregon Health Plan was charged $1700 per person for this guy to tell us that
&quot;I am teachable today.
I don't know if I will relapse tomorrow. Your addiction wants to kill you. You need a higher power
in your recovery program. Go to at least three A.A. or N.A. meetings each week, and get a sponsor.&quot;
<p>
I described that so-called &quot;treatment&quot; more here:

</ol>


<p>
Harry Ketchum is also the fool who counseled me not to quit smoking. &quot;If you put too much on your plate, something
might spill off.&quot; I had to quit smoking. I couldn't breathe any more. In the homeless shelter where I was
staying, I got exposed to every disease in the city, and I came down with multiple colds and flus
and bronchitis and I literally couldn't even get one cigarette down because I would go into such a bad
coughing fit that I couldn't inhale the smoke. 
So I gave it up and went to the doctor and got patches, and quit. Then Harry advised me not to quit smoking.
That is one of the worst pieces of advice that I've ever gotten in my life.
Fortunately, I ignored Harry's advice and followed my own conscience, and stayed quit.
And I'm still quit.

<p>
Then I came down with pneumonia because my lungs were cleaning out the old garbage, smoke and
tar and nicotine and carbon and whatever, so fast that my lungs couldn't expell it fast enough, and tubes
got plugged up in there.
I never dreamed that your lungs could hurt so bad.
Then, when I tried to explain to Harry that I was not able to make my quota of A.A. meetings because
I couldn't go out in the cold winter night air in December with pneumonia, he wouldn't even let me finish
the sentence:
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
&quot;Recovery must be the most important thing in your life.
You can't let <b>anything</b> get in front of your recovery. There is <b>no excuse</b> for not
going to meetings.&quot;
</i></font>
<!-- &quot;You must not let <i>anything</i> get between you and your recovery. If you really want to
recover, you will go to meetings!&quot; -->
He wouldn't even listen to one sentence about my medical condition.
<p>
Harry gave me the creeps. I really didn't like him, but I didn't know quite why. I was glad when he got
sick and took a leave of absence. I finished the &quot;treatment program&quot; with a less insane guy.
The replacement guy had below-average I.Q., and could not get a job as a regular counselor,
because the T.C. managers didn't think that he was qualified, but he could work as a substitute.
Ironically, he was actually a better counselor because he listened to people, rather than
just arrogantly assuming that he knew everything (and we knew nothing).
And he is the guy who handed out slips of paper that listed SMART meetings, for those people who didn't
like A.A. I had never heard of SMART, but I was curious, so I went and checked it out, and
when I saw what it was like, I immediately switched from A.A. to SMART meetings from then on.
So I thank him for that tip.

<p>
So I &quot;graduated&quot; from the &quot;treatment program&quot; without Harry's help. Then, a little over a year later,
I ran into an alumnus from my &quot;group therapy&quot;, and he told me that Harry had been arrested for
child pornography. I asked around, and it turned out that he was arrested for a lot more than that.
(The reason that I had to ask around is because neither the local newspaper, <b>The Oregonian</i></b>,
nor any of the local TV stations reported this story of an outrageously criminal treatment center counselor. Why not?)
Harry Ketchum was actually arrested for two counts of criminal sexual penetration of a minor,
and also possession of cocaine and child pornography. He had cocaine at home, and in his car, and in
his office at the &quot;treatment center&quot;. Then, when they searched his computer, they found it full of
child pornography.
So it turns out that while Harry was counseling us in how to live clean and sober lives, he was going
home and snorting cocaine, and then looking at child pornography on his computer, and then raping his
step-children.
He was convicted on all counts and sent to the Snake River Correctional Facility in Ontario, Oregon,
near the Oregon-Idaho border for several years.
Then he got out and was on probation for some more years.
<p>
Well, I'm happy to report that 11 years later, I have 11 years off of alcohol,
tobacco, and all other drugs too. I'm so clean and pure that it is disgusting.
Harry, on the other hand, has a long criminal history and he may go back to prison again.
He could get another year of prison for failure to register, or he could get probation, if he is lucky.
One thing is certain: I know that he won't be counseling anybody else in how to live clean and sober lives. Thank God!

<p>
By the way, to the best of my knowledge, Harry really is a certified drug and alcohol counselor.
As I have said so many times, certification of drug and alcohol counselors is a joke. The standards are
very, very low. About all that is required is a few classes in how to recruit for Alcoholics Anonymous,
and parrot slogans, and send people to A.A. meetings.

<p>
PAAC and its parent corporation, Central City Concern, are still in business
(at 8th Avenue &amp; NW Burnside in downtown Portland), still selling &quot;treatment&quot;
to the suckers.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Widespread ignorance bordering on idiocy is our new national goal. It's no use
pretending otherwise and telling us, as Thomas Friedman did in the Times a few days
ago, that educated people are the nation's most valuable resources. Sure, they are,
but do we still want them? It doesn't look to me as if we do. The ideal citizen of a
politically corrupt state, such as the one we now have, is a gullible dolt unable to
tell truth from bullshit.

<p>

An educated, well-informed population, the kind that a functioning democracy
requires, would be difficult to lie to, and could not be led by the nose by the
various vested interests running amok in this country. Most of our politicians and
their political advisers and lobbyists would find themselves unemployed, and so
would the gasbags who pass themselves off as our opinion makers. Luckily for them,
nothing so catastrophic, even though perfectly well-deserved and widely-welcome, has
a remote chance of occurring any time soon. For starters, there's more money to be
made from the ignorant than the enlightened, and deceiving Americans is one of the
few growing home industries we still have in this country. A truly educated populace
would be bad, both for politicians and for business.

<p>

--snip--

<p>

In the past, if someone knew nothing and talked nonsense, no one paid any attention
to him. No more. Now such people are courted and flattered by conservative
politicians and ideologues as &quot;Real Americans&quot; defending their country against big
government and educated liberal elites. The press interviews them and reports their
opinions seriously without pointing out the imbecility of what they believe. The
hucksters, who manipulate them for the powerful financial interests, know that they
can be made to believe anything, because, to the ignorant and the bigoted, lies
always sound better than truth:

<p>

<ul>
<li> Christians are persecuted in this country.
<li> The government is coming to get your guns.
<li> Obama is a Muslim.
<li> Global Warming is a hoax.
<li> The president is forcing open homosexuality on the military.
<li> Schools push a left-wing agenda.
<li> Social Security is an entitlement, no different from welfare.
<li> Obama hates white people.
<li> The life on earth is 10,000 years old and so is the universe.
<li> The safety net contributes to poverty.
<li> The government is taking money from you and giving it to sex-crazed college women to pay for their birth control.
</ul>

<p>

One could easily list many more such commonplace delusions believed by Americans.
They are kept in circulation by hundreds of right-wing political and religious media
outlets whose function is to fabricate an alternate reality for their viewers and
their listeners. &quot;Stupidity is sometimes the greatest of historical forces,&quot; Sidney
Hook said once. No doubt. What we have in this country is the rebellion of dull
minds against the intellect. That's why they love politicians who rail against
teachers indoctrinating children against their parents' values and resent the ones
who show ability to think seriously and independently. Despite their bravado, these
fools can always be counted on to vote against their self-interest. And that, as far
as I'm concerned, is why millions are being spent to keep my fellow citizens
ignorant.<br>

Hello Erik,
<p>
Thanks for the information. Yes, I think our country has also suffered from periods of
anti-intellectualism in earlier periods of history, but this time may be worse.
Way back, more than a century ago, we had the &quot;Know-Nothings&quot;, an actual political party. And Kurt Vonnegut
critically summarized the American mind-set with: &quot;If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?&quot;

<p>
Still, the current ignorance worries me. The movie that just came out &quot;Game Change&quot; reveals a
new depth in American politics. Before George W. Bush, have we ever had a time when a blithering
idiot could become President?
Yes, we have had corrupt criminals and murderous liars and fools and weak hands, but idiots? I don't remember any.
<p>
And obviously, it is easier to sell cult religion and quack medicine to ignorant people, too.
There's plenty of money to be made deceiving the ignorant. (And the sick, and the cloudy-headed and confused,
and the superstitious...)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

<p>
Thanks Orange. Last week I emailed my sponsor that I decided to look into other
programs. Surprisingly, she was okay with this and wished me well. In only a week, I
feel so much better that I've stepped away. I feel much clearer about holding myself
accountable rather than Big Brother watching. Thanks for all you're doing to help
shed some light on this issue. Take care.

Hi again, Laine,
<p>
That is good news. I especially like the fact that the sponsor was understanding.
I have received so many horror stories where the sponsor wouldn't ever talk to the sponsee
again after the sponsee said that he or she was going to try another way.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day now.

Subject:  	Thank you for exposing A.A. (Russ)<br>

<p>
Dear Orange-

<p>
I can't thank you enough for exposing Alcoholics Anonymous for who they really are.
A brief story about myself, I got into trouble a while back (DUI) and was told to go
to SATP (Substance Abuse Treatment Program) at the VA hospital in Hampton, VA, and
they told me I needed to go to 3 AA mtgs a week as part of the program and I've been
in AA for a total of 8 months (until yesterday).  At first glance, it seemed to be a
good thing and people were living ordinary lives.  Then as soon as I got into
speaking for the first time (The &quot;Newcomer&quot;) I got bashed harder than anything.  I
was shocked with the way they were speaking to me and then I kept my mouth shut for
the remainder.  I thought that I was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that I had
a serious problem with alcohol when I first met my sponsor and they spoon-fed me the
whole disease theory and that I'm powerless over my addiction.  And he put the spiel
on me and I bought into it real hard, so I decided to take it for what its worth and
work the steps.  The only &quot;restlessness and irritability&quot; I got was from the program
itself and my annoying sponsor telling the same thing over and over, telling me I'm
going to die an alcoholic death, blah, blah, blah, and so on and so on.  I just
recently dropped him and dropped the whole A.A. thing yesterday and I feel more
relief of restlessness and irritability from not having to listen to him constantly
and continuously writing down my 10th and 11th step every day.  This program is so
hurtful and does the opposite of addressing the problem, instead focuses on bashing
the newcomer and making them feel worse than they already are (which would probably
lead them to commit suicide).  I sincerely believed that A.A. was the only solution
to people with alcohol problems, now I'm going to consider something else such as
SMART or SOS.  I see more irritable people and less human decency at these meetings,
especially toward newcomers and just shoveling all this nonsense in their minds
about being powerless, selfish, blah, blah.  Your well-researched and peer-reviewed
literature confirms this organization is nothing more than a bunch of crazed cults
shoveling nonsense into people's brains, making them feel no way out and not
solving the problem with their addiction.  It's no wonder why so many people in AA
commit suicide.  Of course it's gonna take some time to recover from all the bashing
I've received over the course of time from my sponsor, but I already feel a lot
better than I did with the program.

<p>
Again thank you,

<p>
Submitted Respectfully,

<p>
Russ

Subject:  	great site!<br>

<p>
Hey, Orange,

<p>
Thank you for putting together such a wonderful site.  As someone who has
been sent to AA a few times by mental health professionals and absolutely
hated it, it is great to see something confirming all of my suspicions.  I
also have attended SOS and found it to be much less awkward and
depressing.  Also, it didn't seem like the men in SOS were hitting on me.

<p>
Anyways,  I know this is from the jokes section, but oddly enough, I was
actually instructed to do something very similar to this by someone who was
in a 12 step program:

<p>
<center><table width="87%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font color="blue">
And so does my magical ice cream cure that I just invented: Every
time you get
cravings for alcohol, you just go to Baskin Robbins and eat ice cream
instead of drinking alcohol.
<p>
I particularly recommend the French Vanilla. Definitely avoid the
Rum Raisin.
<p>
This simple program does not and can not ever fail, if you
<i>completely</i> give yourself to it.
RARELY HAVE we seen somebody fail this simple program,
except for a few people who are constitutionally incapable
of being honest with their ice cream.
There are such unfortunates among us.
They seem to have been born that way.

<p>
So <i><b>Keep Coming Back!</b></i> to Baskin Robbins. <b><i>It Works If
You Work It! You Die If You Don't! So Work It, You're Worth It!</i></b>

<p>
Allow me to explain: many years ago, late at night, I was all alone and
searching the Craigslist sobriety forum trying to find anyone to talk to.
I was getting those weird, spastic, skin-itchies I get when I crave
something.  I do not only struggle with alcohol issues, but also have
eating disorder issues as well, which I understand is pretty common in a
lot of alcohol abusers.  My eating is often irregular and alternates
between several days of starvation with nothing but liquids followed by
days of binging, and the alcohol definitely doesn't help, and if anything,
helps cover up the eating issues.  Anyways, I mentioned on the Craigslist
forum that I was really feeling like drinking a few 40s or eating several
boxes of girl scout cookies.  Someone honestly told me to go eat as many
damn cookies as I wanted, and it didn't matter at all as long as I didn't
drink.  Long story short, I didn't eat anything or drink anything right
then, but got really pissed off that someone would suggest that I use an
eating disorder to maintain sobriety.  I think this is kind of similar to
how they perceive cigarettes as well.  Cigarettes and eating disorders are
just as deadly, but they are viewed as ok if used as tools to stay off
alcohol.

<p>
I am glad to see that your site does draw the connection between eating and
drug abuse, as mentioned in the Lizard Brain section.  I feel like some AA
groups miss this at times, even though they should be aware considering OA
is also a big group, and the H in HALT stands for hungry.  I know SMART
also has resources for eating disorders.  I feel like any addiction
recovery plan that doesn't at least have additional help for individuals
with eating disorders is incomplete since there is so much overlap.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Crystal

Hello Crystal,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. You make a bunch of good points there.
I especially liked the note of A.A. and N.A. people actually recommending a nicotine addiction
as a substitute for an alcohol or drug addiction. Yes, they do that.
I shudder, just thinking about it. They also rationalize, &quot;Well, I've got to keep <i>something</i>.&quot;

<p>
Yes, the whole eating&#8212;addiction thing is rooted in the same place in the brain.
Switching from alcohol or drugs to eating disorders is just putting a different mask on the monster.
And eating disorders are not okay. They kill people too. There has been a flurry of news stories about
diet and death lately. <i>60 Minutes</i> just did a story about sugar and cancer last Sunday.
Americans are guzzling sugar &#8212; especially High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) &#8212; 
until they come down with morbid obesity and diabetes and cancer and heart attacks. Not fun.
(A friend of mine just came down with diabetes for the first time in his life. Guess what he
habitually drank all day long? Soda pop, which is loaded with HFCS.)

<p>
Personally, I think that HFCS should be outlawed. Putting it in all of our food is literally killing people.
<p>
Those fools on Craig's List who recommended that you pig out on cookies were not giving out good advice.
It's funny how many self-appointed experts and know-it-alls there are in the recovery field.

<p>
Oh, well, have a good day, and a good life now.
