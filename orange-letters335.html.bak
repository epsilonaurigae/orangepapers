Dear Orange,

<p>
Well, one can always hope, but I am an unamerican person for I am a pessimist.
Unless people are hungry or are seriously suppressed, but have hope for more
freedom, they tend to be conservative (literally). In the case of the DDR [East Germany] it was
free travel or the right to leave. Which they found was a nice right, if you can afford
to. What they bought instead was satellite TV :-( and then cars.
<p>
The term 'freedom' is a subject on it's own.
<p>
You are right, those two changes could change the world massively. But even
with energy at it's actual long term cost, people would still drive cars and fly
with planes. Costs would increase, everything would get more expensive (in the
short term and visibly), but the majority would have more money as well, because there
would be less unemployment (now it is masked by youth unemployment, incarceration,
underemployment and statistical tricks), better wages, because of more demand and lower
taxes. There would be high inflation for a while. But just because all goods would
have a
higher price, does not mean that life would get more expensive to the same extent. The
taxes could be lower, something that I would expect Republicans to love.
The lack of natural resources would become the dominant economic constraint. Human
ability
and education (engineering) the second. That is the way it should be, those limits I
would
consider natural.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Interesting. The one thing there that I am sure of is lack of natural resources.
Heck, we are already there. We have already run out of free land, trees, buffalo, and slaves,
and are also out of copper, good iron ore (we still have low-grade iron ore), oil, and even uranium.
That will certainly raise the price of everything.
</font>
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Corporate welfare will end. The only question is whether the United States of America
will die first, getting bled dry from propping up the corporations.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course a nation can not die, but apparently it takes a worse financial
meltdown than 2008 to force change. Unlike the USSR and DDR the USA can maintain
global power and internal hope. As the last super-power there is little to no
outside pressure. The democratic system and the media can maintain the hope of
the american dream. Most citizens have either lost all hope, feel ashamed to
organize and protest openly or think that all it takes is a better president and
less government (spending). I even read that the problems are because people are not
religious and moral enough anymore.
<p>
I think capitalism is much more resilient than Marx and Engels believed. Just
because it is inherently unstable and destructive, apparently does not mean that
it will be replaced. It is not a transitional phenomena. I would not be
surprised to learn that it is the final stage of any society (Think of the roman
empire and it's total capitalism).

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are more optimistic than I am. I know that the land and the people will go on, but
what form of government they will have is another matter. I expect that the economic system
will continue to be some kind of capitalism and private enterprise, but the survival
of the current government is an open question. It will be especially difficult to keep
the system together after the dollar crashes, which it will do when it is no longer the
world's reserve currency.
<p>
Some people expect that the USA will fracture into two or more smaller countries.
Maybe three or four: East, Midamerica, South, and West.
It may be impossible to keep the country together when transportation breaks down and
some guys in Washington DC are trying to dictate what the people in the distant western states will do.
<p>
One sensible idea that I've heard is that western USA and western Canada will join to form
a new country. They have more in
common with each other than either do with eastern USA or Canada. Some people joke that when they drew
the line on the map dividing the USA and Canada, they got it wrong. It should have been
a vertical line through the middle of the continent.
<p>
Some western provinces of Canada have already inquired about what it would take to join the USA.
They would like to secede from the Canadian government in the East.
But the truth is, all of the western states of the USA and Canada would like to secede from the East.

<p>
It will be hard to keep them in the fold when all that Washington or Ottowa can offer the American West is
Weimar-style paper money.
<p>
Somebody to read for more ideas about that is James H. Kunstler.
His web site is:

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Don't say that too loud, if veterans are present, they are insulted, they are proud that
they stole / defended &quot;our way of living&quot;. I know some and they are always like: I'm no
well-fare moocher I have a job and I served my country, I went to Iraq three times, you
better thank me for my willingness to sacrifice for your freedom.
<p>
In the US there is a disparity between the standing of politicians, the pentagon
elite and
soldiers. The ones ordering war are liars. The ones organizing war are either genius or
responsible for failure. The ones volunteering to do the killing are heroes.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I understand. I'm a Veteran too. It really leaves a bitter taste in your mouth to know that
an entire damn war &#8212; the Vietnam War &#8212; was a big lie and it was all for nothing.
There are still many Vietnam Vets who imagine that they accomplished great things in Vietnam.
They are massively <i>in denial</i>. But lots more do know. More Vietnam Vets have died from
suicide after the war than were killed during the war.
And that doesn't include deaths from drugs and alcohol.

<p>
It will take a bunch more years for the Iraqi veterans to come to the same conclusion, although
many are already aware.

<p>
Have you noticed, that the idea is old? It is the same logic that they used to
legitimate household slaves.
The household slave can be happy to live in a house, be around the worthy people and get
the leftovers. When recently people were appalled to hear a republican say Afro-Americans
should be happy to live in such a nice nation, they should not have been surprised, the
man was fully in party line. Reaganomics are basically slavery in a modern improved form.
<p>
Today the slaves don't even know that they are slaves anymore and blame themselves. One
has to appreciate how ingenious the dogma is.

<p>
We have neither Halloween nor Thanksgiving in the sense you do. There is a
religious fest called &quot;Harvest thanks giving&quot;, but it is of little
significance. Most of these fest predate Christianity and are based
on seasonal fixed events, thus you can expect all north European cultures to
have fest around the same dates, but with different significance. For some
reason the finish of the harvest and slaughtering season as well as the Equinox
have lost significance in Germany. The winter Solstice, better known as
Christmas, is the only super important Holiday, when the family must gather.

Okay, well now I can wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

deaths is acceptable. the rebellion here is growing. keep doing what you
are doing friend.

Hello again, Royski,
<p>
Ah yes, the depleted uranium shells. I had forgotten about that. What I remembered was
the use of cluster bombs in civilian neighborhoods of Baghdad.
Cluster bombs are anti-personel weapons that are clusters of lots of little bombs, each one of
which is just the right size to blow up one person.
The problem with such bombs is that lots of the little bomblets don't explode when the
big bomb goes off. Children find bomblets laying in the streets and play with them, and bang!

<p>
Using cluster bombs on civilian populations is a war crime, but nobody has been sent to the Hague
for trial.
<p>
When asked about it, the commanding American general said that he felt that the use of such
weapons was &quot;appropriate&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a Merry Christmas anyway.

From:  	&quot;Ben K&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Treatment bait and switch<br>

<p>
Hi,
<p>
Interesting, well-documented site. I too encountered many of the
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch tactics</a>
described, which is one of the reasons I am no longer in AA/NA. However,
there is one egregious bait-and-switch tactic in regard to treatment centers not
covered on the list.
<p>
I did the typical 28-day detox and rehab at a treatment center
that had a specialized unit for young adults. About two-thirds of the way through
the stay, my counselor recommended a 90-day &quot;aftercare program.&quot; (Everyone receives
the same recommendation, and it's the facility's extended care unit. $Ka-ching!) The
&quot;recommendation,&quot; like the &quot;suggestions&quot; of the Twelve Steps, was not a
recommendation at all &#8212; the counselor had convinced my parents and psychiatrist
beforehand that I absolutely needed the 90-day program (they are the &quot;experts in
addiction,&quot; after all) and then conference-called them in when I was to make my
&quot;decision.&quot; It was more or less a second intervention, with the same terms: Go to
treatment or get out of the house. So into the 90-day program I went, and, deja vu
all over again, about two-thirds of the way through I learned that it wasn't really
a 90-day program, but &quot;Stage I&quot; of a year-long program and another
intervention-style meeting with my parents ensued. So much for that informed consent
stuff.
<p>
However, I had already discovered firsthand that AA, as you describe, is not
a &quot;quit drinking&quot; program but a &quot;get religion&quot; program. Fortunately, I managed to
convince my parents to let me go back to college and to secular recovery programs
instead and I haven't looked back. Bait-and-switch: 30 days becomes 90, then a year,
and then a lifetime, as they are training you to become a lifetime AA member. Just
another way the AA/treatment industry is coercive in nature, and this type is
particularly abhorrent as it targets vulnerable and financially dependent young
adults and adolescents.

<p>
Ben K.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ben,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well,
and escaped from the trap. Yes, that is despicable. It also sounds criminal.
I would send that story to your state Attorney General for fraud investigation.
<p>
Not only are they doing a bait-and-switch trick &#8212; first 28 days will do it, then, no, you need 90 days,
then no, 1 year, then more, your life &#8212; but they are also passing off a cult
religion as &quot;therapy&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot;, which is pure quackery, and fraud.
They are guilty of false advertising too. They did not advertise a hocus-pocus religious
program before they took your parents' money, did they?
<p>
Which leads to the question of just what <i>did</i> they promise?
I notice that treatment centers and &quot;treatment programs&quot; are great with the vague generalities
about &quot;helping clients&quot;,
but if you ask for a contract up front that declares specifically what the treatment will be,
and what the results will be,
there is no such contract, and the promises are all just fluffy-sounding euphemisms.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters11.html#seven_rehabs" target="_blank">The only really iron-clad solid promise
 that I ever heard of</a>
in one of those contracts is that
you (or your parents) must pay the full price for the &quot;treatment&quot;, even
if you drop out of the program immediately. You must pay in full.
That's the big promise.

<p>
I'm adding your story to
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. horror stories</a>.
<p>
What I'm curious about is how they sized up your parents' bank account.
Or maybe they just try that &quot;additional treatment&quot; scam on everybody, and see which
parents can afford it.
<p>
You see, that is actually a very old scam, and it isn't restricted to just drug and alcohol
rehab. It's common in all kinds of children's psychiatric facilities, or &quot;rehab facilities&quot;,
or &quot;behavioral problem programs&quot;.
&quot;Youth treatment facilities&quot; of all kinds find that the richer the parents, the
more the child is in need of many months or years of expensive treatment. The poor people's
children, on the other hand, are quickly declared cured, as soon as the health insurance runs out,
and they are discharged even if they are very sick and suicidal.
<p>
We talked about that before,
<a href="orange-letters42.html#child_rehab" target="_blank">here</a>
and 
<a href="orange-letters13.html#tx" target="_blank">here</a>.


<p>

And I use that &quot;killjoy&quot; word very deliberately. I can't help but notice that there are some

<p>
Wow. I am so glad I have what I have and believe what I believe. You are welcome to
yours. There is something missing in your explanations. You hate AA, God, and just
plain do not believe in anything else but mans own greatness. You are well schooled
and highly intellectual. However you were not there when I needed someone. AA was
there and as long as I live I will stand up for AA because it saved my life. I will
be there for someone who is broken and needs love and hope. and yes I am in the
medical field. I am a Registered Nurse and a Certified Case Manager with over 25
years in the medical field. Nothin I can say to you will change your opinions.
But I will no longer sit  back and be quiet while people like yourself
deride the very thing that saved my life and my friends life. I won't stand for it.
I will shout the blessings of recovery, AA, God until the  day I die....

Hello again, Michael,
<p>
When you say that you are happy with your beliefs, that is no different from someone
who says, &quot;Well, I'm happy with my faith in Santa Claus. I know that he brings
me goodies. I don't care what anybody else says. I will oppose those who dare to
criticize Santa.&quot; That is no basis for &quot;treating a disease&quot;.

<p>
No, I do not &quot;hate God&quot;. It's funny how the A.A. true believers just can't stand the idea
that other people have different theological ideas than them
 &#8212; maybe even really intelligent and valid ideas. Maybe mature ideas, rather than
Santa Claus spirituality.
For some odd reason, the A.A. true believers just have to declare that the critics are all
atheists who hate God. Not so. Read the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a> if you want
to know what I believe.

<p>
It's nice that somebody held your hand when you felt bad. That does not make A.A. a valid method
of treating alcohol abuse or alcohol addiction. It's still quackery.
<p>
The fact that you are a registered nurse who sells quackery makes matters worse.
With your education and training, you should know something about how to test medications
and treatment methods to
see how well they work. And you know that you should reject the ones that don't work, or do harm.
You don't treat fevers with bleeding, or mental illnesses with the snake pit, do you?
So why are you using the practices of an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties
to treat &quot;alcoholism&quot;?

<p>
By the way, being a registered nurse does not make you a psychiatrist who is qualified to treat
the people
<a href="orange-letters334.html#Michael_W" target="_blank">whom you described in your last letter</a>
as
<b>&quot;people who have severe psychological illnesses&quot;</b>.
But that's what you are trying to do: cure mental illness with cult religion.
You said in your last letter that you foisted the 12-Step cure on them, and when it didn't work,
you blamed their mental illness. That is quackery.

<p>
A.A. did not save your life. You saved your own life. You chose to quit drinking, and then you did it.
Nobody did it for you. Nobody else holds your hand every Saturday night and keeps you from drinking.
You keep yourself sober.
It's really all your will power and your self-reliance.
You do the work, and then you mistakenly give the credit to somebody else.
<p>
The fact remains that most people who come to A.A. do not make that choice in A.A., or because of
A.A. They walk out, appalled by the cult religion insanity.
They may later recover someplace else, some other way, but they don't recover in A.A.
Since you are a nurse, you can certainly read a few doctors' reports on how A.A. doesn't work:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
<p>
Speaking of which,
<a href="orange-letters334.html#rate" target="_blank"> I asked you in the last letter
about the A.A. success rate</a>.
I notice that you did not answer that question. Instead, you just accused me of hating God.
So I'll ask again: What is the actual A.A. success rate in
sobering up alcoholics? Without any excuses or any lying with qualifiers, what
is the A.A. success rate in sobering up alcoholics?
<p>
HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
What would you think of a doctor who insisted on <b><i>only</i></b>
prescribing a medicine that had worse than a 95% failure rate?

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas now.

Subject:  	Re: Another Bullshit Comment from the Peanut Gallery<br>

<p>
(I think you might have gotten part of this email from me, already, but
Claws is misbehaving today. Hopefully, this is the whole thing.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Nope, got nothing before. Claws sabotaged it, so it's good that you resent it.
</font>
<p>
I went to my sister's graduation yesterday. We're all glad she finally
graduated, but the speeches left a lot to be desired. Yes, we all know
the economy sucks, but you really don't need to remind us of that. Oh,
and we got AA propaganda, too.

<p>
First, let me point out this was the graduation ceremony for UGA's
college of agriculture. Nothing to do with alcohol or counseling at
all. They awarded some medallion of honor to this husband-and-wife
team, who donated land and money to the college, especially when the
college faced budget cuts. They let this husband-and-wife team speak at
the ceremony. And that's when it started.

<p>
The husband spoke first. He talked about making money as an investment
banker, and about his passion for agriculture and hiking. Standard
inspirational speech stuff. He talked a bit about AA and how it helped
him (what? you don't think picking up new hobbies helped, dude?). A bit
annoying, but not too bad.

<p>
Then, the wife spoke. Suddenly, we were in an AA meeting. And we
couldn't leave, because we were all here to either graduate or watch
our family members graduate. She mentioned that NPR said something
about college students liking to drink and used that to segue into some
propaganda. It was the standard AA propaganda about how alcoholics have
a disease, and how AA helps. But that was all she talked about. Nothing
about agriculture or anything. Just AA, AA, AA to a captive audience.

<p>
First of all, I would think most graduates would have grown out of
getting smashed every weekend. It's quite possible to like drinking and
not have a problem. And I personally find this &quot;alcoholism is a
disease!&quot; nonsense irritating for one reason. You can not have that
first drink. I can't do anything to prevent myself from having
delusions, other than taking my meds and hoping they don't stop
working. Yes, there often is an underlying mental illness, but drinking
is a behavior. Just like cutting is a behavior (I knew quite a few
cutters in the mental hospital). And AA isn't gonna do shit for mental
illness. All AA does is distort your thinking further.

<p>
Even my sister, who generally buys into AA propaganda, was annoyed. (To
be fair, this was the first time she had any exposure to AA's
nuttiness.) She found the speech inappropriate for a college
graduation.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, really inappropriate. But that is a standard cult characteristic.
The true believers just can't stop proselytizing and recruiting for their favorite cult religion.
It's like an obsession.
&quot;Attraction, not promotion&quot; like hell.

</font>
<p>
As for your letter, I did do a bit of searching about turning the
touchpad off in Linux. I found something for Ubuntu users through a
search engine (not really relevant for somebody using a slackware
derivative), and some KDE utility in the repositories. I'm not sure if
I hate the touchpad enough to install a bunch of KDE dependencies.
Right now, my laptop is at 933 MHz and 310 MB with Icecat and Claws
Mail open. And I think Icecat is having a memory leak (no surprise,
since Icecat is a rebranded Firefox with a couple of extra security
features). Memory leak aside, I rather like things that way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I've been having problems with that memory leak too. Big problems.
My system would seize up and become glacially slow, and I would find that the
1.5 GB of swap space was exhausted. So I created a second 1.5 GB swap space in a file.
And over the course of several days it will fill up both. And unfortunately,
just killing and restarting Firefox won't get the memory back. I have to
reboot the machine to clear the swap spaces. That is inconvenient when I'm in the middle
of doing things, and I have to suddenly stop and close all files, and save all work to avoid losing anything,
while the machine takes forever to do even that simple task because it's out of swap
space and thrashing... Pain.
</font>
<p>
Although turning the touchpad off would make things slightly easier
when Titania takes an interest in my laptop. She's quite good at
operating it for a cat. She can type, use the touchpad, and turn the
laptop off. I think cats are the only form of malware that runs just as
well on Linux as it does on Windows. Except for stuff that runs under
WINE. Compatibility with Windows programs means compatibility with
malware, too.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that I think about it, that function was on one of the function keys.
On an Acer laptop, it was &quot;Function&#8212;F7&quot;. That is, hold down the &quot;Fn&quot; key
and hit F7. That would toggle the touchpad on and off. (That is with Ubuntu, which knew about
those special function keys and programmed things correctly.)
But that machine deteriorated to unusability, just slowly stopped working, part
by part, so I got a Compal laptop (used, Goodwill, broken screen that I replaced),
and it doesn't have the same functions on the function keys.
Fn&#8212;F7 is &quot;speaker volume down&quot; on this machine.
There is no toggle for the touchpad.
So I seem to be stuck with a touchpad because I don't know how to turn it off.

</font>
<p>
As for the ermine, I'm sorry to hear that. I can certainly understand
the temptation to get rid of it, but predators need to eat, too. And
unfortunately, they can't be picky enough to eat only the mean and ugly
prey. The more ruthless a predator is, the better it survives.

<p>
<font color="blue">
All true, but it's still very tempting to ask the ermine if it wouldn't like
to be immortalized as a fur coat for a queen.
</font>
<p>
At least my own pet predator seems to have slowed down in her old age.
She still gets kills, but not as often as she used to. That, and she
has a colony of younger feral cats to compete with, who do not have the
option of eating from a food bowl when they get no kills. (There
were feral cats at the farm, but they were more spread out. Here,
the feral cats came from an abandoned hoarder house.) Quite a few feral
cats have been popping in the back yard, since my mom has been feeding
the birds that are still here for the winter.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Bummer. Now there is a very good argument for eliminating feral cats.
Here in Oregon they call such things &quot;invasive species&quot;, and try to get rid
of them because they do a lot of harm to the balance of nature.
<p>
Speaking of back yards, my back yard is loaded with little birds. I got a bunch of used bird feeders
from Goodwill &#8212; you know, those vertical plastic tubes with holes in the
side &#8212; and filled them with birdseed and hung them from the front porch and trees in
the back yard, and it didn't take the birds very long to discover them.
It's winter now, and all of the other seeds have been found and eaten, and the bugs are gone,
and the weeds are dead,
so there just isn't much for a little bird to eat. Tough times. When they discover my
feeders full of seeds, they not only stuff themselves every day, they also tell all of
their friends, who tell their other friends, who tell...,
and now I have flocks of little birds in my back yard pretty much all of the time.
<p>
After I typed those words, I went to the window and looked out, and sure enough, there are a
bunch of little birds braving the wind and getting seeds out of the feeders. The weather is
semi-stormy, rainy, cold, windy, at 10:30 AM, and the wind is blowing the feeders around,
and they are swinging in the wind. Nevertheless,
the birds manage to land on the little perch bars of the feeders and grab a mouthful of seeds.
<p>
It's a good thing that I bought two big bags of birdseed at the farm supply store, because those
birds are eating a lot. Hungry little turkeys.

</font>
<p>
Cat chat aside, my 21st birthday is coming up. I plan to ask my
psychiatrist if it's okay for me to drink. If the answer
is no, that's the end of that. If it's okay, I'll have my bartender
sister help me pick drinks I might like. If there's a problem, I
believe I'm capable of not having another drink. If I need somebody to
fix my head so that I can quit, I know people who can do that. And they
have more qualifications to check people's brains than drug/alcohol
&quot;counselors&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds reasonable. Happy birthday.
</font>
<p>
Incidentally, I've heard marriage counselors are just as bad as
drug/alcohol counselors. So I guess the lesson is to stay away from the
therapists who claim to specialize in certain situations. The
therapists that know shit talk about approaches like
CBT/REBT/Gestalt/Psychodynamic/etc.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. Like how does someone become an &quot;expert&quot; on marital difficulties and resolving them?
It's so easy for someone to take a few community college courses and then
hang out a shingle and claim that he is a qualified &quot;counselor&quot;,
but how do you get the wisdom, really? Six marriages and divorces? That gives
experience in not working it right, but little knowledge about how to make it work.
One marriage that lasted forever? That gives no experience in breakups.
So how do you become an &quot;expert&quot;?
<p>
And of course we encounter the same lack of expertise in drug and alcohol counselors.
Being an addict does not automatically make someone an expert on recovery.
Of course my so-called &quot;counselor&quot; was a world-class loser,
what with parroting cult slogans all day long,
and then snorting cocaine and looking at child porn on his computer and
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Christina" target="_blank">then raping his
step-children</a>.
Some counselor. What a great life coach. And to think that they actually paid
him to be a counselor. Your tax dollars at work.

<p>
I feel like what I would want in a counselor is an ancient wise man or woman who knows it all (and who
hasn't grown senile).  But those things are as rare as can be.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Subject:  	Cults<br>

<p>
I came across
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">your page about cults</a>.
I am wondering if you are bias to any
one cult?  Had you had any experience with any?  Legit question.

<p>
Regards,

<p>
Carol

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Carol,
<p>
Thanks for the question. Yes, legit.
<p>
I can happily re-use Archie Bunker's famous line about &quot;Heck, I ain't prejudiced.
I hate everybody equally, regardless of race, creed, sex, color, religion, or
country of national origin.&quot;
<p>
All kidding aside, I'm opposed to all cults pretty much equally. They are all
harmful, and dishonest and deceitful, and waste people's time and money, and worse,
lead people away from spirituality and enlightenment. Cults hold out the promise of a better life,
with wisdom and spirituality, and maybe even a ticket to Heaven, and they deliver just the opposite.
Some are worse than others, but they are all bad.
<p>
(And that isn't even counting the mass suicides, which are actually a very rare phenomenon.)

<p>
I don't think it makes a lot of difference whether people waste years of their lives in the Moonies
or Scientology or Alcoholics Anonymous.
It's still a waste, and leaves people feeling inadequate and stupid and used, and
misinformed and misled and abused.  And often bitter and angry. That sure ain't Heaven.
<p>
Yes, I have had a bunch of experience with cults, but fortunately never joined one. I just hung
out on the periphery of several, without committing my soul, so to speak.
I was a child of the 'sixties, which was a time when new cults were popping up like mushrooms.
There were a whole bunch of phony gurus who came over here from the East to help themselves
to the American kids' money, and also a bunch
of American cockroaches who came out of the woodwork and set up cults.
Because I was very interested in spiritual things and higher consciousness, I checked out, and
hung out with, a bunch of them, including Scientology, Jesus Freaks, Sufis,
Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, and Yogi Bhajan's 3HO.
And I studied even more of them, all that I could. I'd buy their books and learn what I could.
That included Carlos Castaneda and <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i>, and
&quot;Werner Erhard's&quot; <i>est</i> and the Rajneeshis, and
more than I can remember.
And then I'd learn more from members of the various groups, religions, and cults, who were more
than happy to tell me about their great new thing.
<p>
I'm lucky in never having quite joined and sold my soul. It's just that I'm not much of a joiner.
When I would hear something that rubbed me the wrong way, I'd just sort of wander on down the
road and go check out somebody else. That saved me a lot of grief, although I didn't know it
at the time. At that time I thought they were just a bunch of nice people with strange &quot;other&quot;
religions.
It took more than 20 years before all of the stories about the nightmares in
those cults started coming out, and drop-outs told me
about their experiences inside of those cults.

<p>
Now I'm happy to say that it isn't all negative. There are still a few genuine teachers around who
didn't ever betray the trust, and who have remained good people through it all.
I particularly like Baba Ram Dass (the former Prof. Richard Alpert of Harvard University),
and his teacher Neem Karoli Baba.
And I like Pir Villayat Khan of the Sufis.
And the other Sufis like Pir's father, Hazrat Inayat Khan, and Sufi Sam.
And of course the Dalai Lama.
And although I don't know a lot about him, I never heard a bad word about Lama Govinda.

<p>
Thank God for a few jewels.

<p>
Have a good day now, and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

BLOG NOTE: 2012.12.20:

<p>
According to some people, the Mayan calendar ends tomorrow, and so does the world.
It's the end of time.
<p>
I don't think so. The true story is very simple: A thousand years ago, a Mayan was busy
chiseling and carving a big calendar in stone, working on days and months and years
that will happen a thousand years in the
future,  when he suddenly yelled, &quot;Dammit, my fingers hurt!
I'm tired of this. Why am I wasting my time carving a calendar a thousand years
in the future? I quit!&quot; And he threw down his hammer and chisel and walked away, and never
worked on the calendar again. The day he had been chiseling into the stone when he quit?
You guessed it, Dec. 21, 2012.
<p><br>
A comment to the Washington Post gave a different answer:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For the record, it was a couple of seriously baked, ancient Mayan civil servants
who f'd up that calendar stone. They spaced, and ran out of space at 12/21/2012.
Instead of trashing the thing, they thought it would be hilarious to screw with
the heads of people in the future. They picked up some jammin' chimichangas,
headed off to an out of the way abandoned temple and buried it, giggling their
@sses off the whole time.

BLOG NOTE: 2012.12.25:
<p>
I was just thinking back on that Mayan End of Time thing, and I recalled the TV news programs
that showed crowds of people gathering at Mayan shrines to pray. There were quite a bunch of them,
all very concerned about the end of the Mayan calendar.
<p>
Now that the world didn't end, they can all claim that their prayers really worked, and saved the world,
and kept Time from coming to an end.
<p>
It's a perfect example of our inability to prove a negative: Can you prove that their praying didn't work,
and didn't really save the world? Nope.
<p>
It's the same problem as proving that people going to A.A. meetings and praying doesn't make people
quit drinking. You know it's ridiculous and a bunch of hogwash, but you can't logically prove that Joe Blow
wasn't saved by praying and doing the 12 Steps.
<p>
It's also the same logic as this old joke:

A.A. and The Twelve Steps keep people from drinking just like how the torn pages
keep away the elephants.
The thing that really keeps the elephants away from the USA is the Atlantic Ocean,
of course.
And the thing that really keeps A.A. members from drinking is their desire to live a better life.

From:  	&quot;HUGH G.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	A man of 30.<br>

<p>
Hello again.

<p>
On page 32 of the Big Book (3rd edition) Bill Wilson describes the man of 30 who
showed definite signs of alcoholism. This man we are told gave up drinking for 25
years before doing what he had always intended to do ... that is to start drinking
again.

<p>
Do we have any more information about this man? Do we know his name? Where did he
live? How did Bill know about him? How did this alcoholic stop drinking without the
help of AA and the 12 steps? Bill may have realised there was a problem with this
story as he did not describe him as sober but as bone dry and no doubt the steppers
will say he was a dry drunk but how do they explain someone remaining sober for 25
years without the 12 steps? and Bill described him as &quot;happy&quot;. This guy did not
relapse in the AA sense, he did what he was always going to do. He did't stop working
a programme &#8212; he never had a programme. The steppers will say he was not a
&quot;real&quot;alcoholic but Bill Wilson had no doubt.

<p>
I am in my 19th year of sobriety and I know  many people who have been sober in AA
for over 25 years BUT I also know that the vast majority of AA members have within 0
 &#8212; 2 or 3 years sobriety and that most new people leave after a few meetings. I
expect that some of those who leave and are never seen again do what the man of 30
did &#8212; get sober without AA.

<p>
I am now in my 2nd year without meetings after spending far too much time in dingy
church halls.

<p>
I think the moral of the story is that if you want to stop drinking you can and if
you want to drink you probably will.

<p>
Take care

<p>

Hello Hugh,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You bring up some interesting points, and I couldn't agree more.
And congratulations on your sobriety and your freedom from the cult.

<p>
I find it funny that you mention that the guy didn't &quot;relapse&quot; because he did what he always
intended to do: drink some more.
Coincidentally, or maybe not coincidentally, I ran into this goofy definition of relapse
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html#unintended" target="_blank">in some pro-A.A. propaganda</a>
years ago:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Nevertheless, relapse (the unintended abuse of alcohol during recovery) even while involved with
AA is a distressingly common phenomenon.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I had to ask then, &quot;Is it not a relapse if you really did intend to party your brains out?&quot;

<p>
Incidentally, I also have 12 years sober now, without any A.A.,
and disgruntled A.A. members also routinely tell me that
<a href="orange-letters83.html#dts" target="_blank">I wasn't a &quot;real alcoholic&quot;</a>,
and that's why I was able to quit without A.A.
Well, life sure would have been easier if I had not been &quot;a real alcoholic&quot;.
<p>
Those extreme stories, like sober for 25 years before &quot;relapsing&quot;, really stretch the A.A. dogma
to absurd lengths. Obvious questions occur to me like, &quot;Okay, why don't you stay sober for 25
years now, and then you can have a big Christmas and New Years blow-out and party for a week,
and then you will remain sober for another 25 years, and then you can have another
big Christmas blow-out, and then you will remain sober for another 25 years...&quot;
Actually, that sounds like a pretty healthy and successful lifestyle.
Only drunk once every 25 years? I'd hardly call that a problem with &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
But of course Bill Wilson wanted to make the story into a scary horror story:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;The Big Bad Booze Bogeyman will get you, even after 25 years, unless you
join my cult and do my Steps.&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and a happy holiday season.

My higher power is jesus Christ

<p>
The higher power was an awakening

<p>
That was in 1990

<p>
I haven't bothered with the lifestyle

<p>
Surrounded with drinking since then

<p>
I tried formal religions which talked of love

<p>
Of Christ

<p>
I didn't stay as it was talk no action

<p>
You should spend your time on more

<p>
Productive matters

<p>
Go and look how young people are owned by satan when they drink or

<p>
Use drugs

Hello Terry,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I think that telling the truth to people is something productive.
I also notice how people who join a cult are often selling their soul to the Devil.
(<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">Look here</a>).

<p>
Have a good day now, and a happy holiday season.

Hello Carlos,
<p>
Thanks for the invite.
Yes, still sober, after all these years. Now it's up to 12 years, no alcohol, no drugs, not even a cigarette.
<p>
How sweet it is.
<p>
Have a good day now, and a happy holiday season.
