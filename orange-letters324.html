Subject:  	Re: Thanks and where's Carmen?<br>

<p>
Thank you and I am glad you're not offended by my dog herding geese. I
think much the same &#8212; that it is actually beneficial to geese (and wildlife
and stray cats and birds) to learn early in life that other species, while
sometimes benevolent, can also pose great danger. So I rationalise my dog
herding the geese as it being a good life-lesson for them: first and
foremost, be wary. I also have a good friend who is a federally licensed
wildlife rehabilitator and her attitude &#8212; for the wellbeing of wild
critters &#8212; is that it's unhealthy for wild animals/birds to get too
attached to humans; they survive better by remaining wary and being
self-sufficient.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bodrell,
<p>
That &quot;wellbeing of wild critters&quot; thing seems to be very confused. I get that a lot.
I sort of cringe when I hear about animals &quot;surviving in the wild&quot;.

<p>
I got a lecture from a self-appointed &quot;wildlife expert&quot; just two weeks ago
&#8212;  somebody who was sure that she knew what she was talking about because she
heard it somewhere. I was feeding some
whole-wheat bread to the ducks and geese at the Fernhill Wetlands, and a woman informed me that I
shouldn't be doing that because it wasn't good for them. I told her that it was whole wheat bread,
not white bread.
See, right on the label? Whole wheat, all natural ingredients, no trans-fat.  She objected that
it wasn't organic. I admitted that yes, it is possible that the farmer might have used insecticides
on the crop of grain.
<p>
Then I pointed to the ducks that were following me and happily taking the bread from me. See these guys?
I've been feeding them for a couple of years now, and they are doing just fine.
She still insisted that the wildlife should be flying away and finding organic food &quot;in the wild&quot;, and
walked away in a huff.
<p>
It really reminded me of a scene from <i>Portlandia</i>. That show is a spoof of Portland, and how
Portlanders are sometimes just a little too &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;newage&quot;.
For example, in one show, a couple walked into a restaurant to have
lunch, and were considering chicken, and started asking about, was it raised organically? Free-range? Uncrowded?
Locally grown?
Then the couple had to drive out to the farm to meet the farmer and inspect the farm where the chicken was grown.
And they asked, &quot;Was the chicken happy while it was alive?&quot; Oh yes. Finally, they decided to have something else
for lunch. That's <i>Portlandia</i>. Well, this woman's tirade about feeding the ducks and geese organic food
reminded me of that.

<p>
What she didn't realize is, there is no &quot;organic wilderness&quot; out there
for the geese. The Fernhill Wetlands is the best that they get, and there isn't a
lot of grassy meadow around for them to graze. Look around. Nothing but farms in
every direction except town. And the farmers use fertilizers and insecticides on those fields.
And the farmers really don't want the geese coming and eating their crops. That
imaginary &quot;wilderness&quot; that she was talking about disappeared a century
ago.
<p>
It really is like people who imagine that the Indians should still be riding horses bareback, chasing the
herds of buffalo across the Great Plains, rather than living on reservations and getting government checks.
And the skies are darkened by the flocks of Passenger Pigeons, and the wild ducks and geese
live out there in the wild and never have contact with humans. Gone. All gone, long ago.
<p>
Worse yet, if you want something really horrifying, you can go to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife's
web site, and find the form to fill out for a permit to destroy Canada Geese. Yes, just fill out this form,
and pay something like $27, and you can get a permit to kill every Canada Goose that lands on your property.
Not just during hunting season, either. All year long. And the farmers can raid the geese's nests and destroy the
eggs, too. Then, at the end of the year, the farmer just fills out a form telling how many geese he killed
and how many eggs he broke, and sends it in. And then he can do the same thing again next year.
The farmer is actually legally entitled to eradicate the geese on his property.

<p>
That is the &quot;wilderness&quot; where the geese are supposed to go find organic food.
</font>

<p>
Also my dog really freaking LOVES herding and controlling hundreds of
geese, and since I don't have a herd of cattle for her, I am happy to let
her indulge her breed instinct with geese (or small children or whatever)
whenever I can.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it is amazing how that behavior has been bred into them. They just are not happy if they are not
herding something. They think that the purpose of life is to herd things.

<p>
Similarly, I had an experience with a retriever one time. I was at a city park with my first family of
goslings. Somebody had a dog on a leash, and a kitten in his arms. The kitten got spooked and jumped from
his arms and ran, and the dog broke loose, ripping the leash out of the owner's hand,
and chased after the kitten. The kitten ran nearly at me, it went right by me, and the
dog followed right on his heels. Then the dog saw my goslings and changed direction abruptly, and grabbed
one of the goslings in his mouth. I grabbed the dog and went right into his mouth and took my gosling back out.
Then the dog tried to get another one and I held him off.
Afterwards, I was surprised at myself. I had never actually gone into a dog's mouth to take something out
of his mouth like that. But I wasn't going to give up my kid easily.
<p>
Fortunately, the dog only soft-mouthed the gosling, and didn't actually hurt it. The dog's instinctive
behavior was to grab and hold, but not bite down. Thank goodness.
If he had bitten down, the gosling would have died instantly. But he just soft-mouthed it.
Yes, he was a retriever. He didn't really
want to hurt the kitten or gosling, he just wanted to play. Chasing and grabbing and holding was his idea of fun.
<p>
As it was, the poor gosling had to bathe for an hour to wash off all of the dog slobber.
And you know, that gosling still wasn't terrified of dogs after that.
</font>

<p>
As far as alcoholism &#8212; I recently joined a secular email list (LifeRing)
and have shared
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">your lizard brain link</a> a few times; it's been very much
appreciated.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks, yes. I consider that one of my best web pages, and it is the distillation of about 30 years of
experience with quitting smoking and backsliding, and then a few years of quitting drinking.

</font>
<p>

Also I loved your response to
<a href="orange-letters323.html#Mike_C" target="_blank">Mike C</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>
Wow. Forget about that &quot;unconditional love&quot; A.A. slogan. You don't
unconditionally love them at all. Like Penn &amp; Teller said in their TV
program on A.A.: &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has no respect for alcoholics.&quot; Look
here:<br>

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This really struck me because it matched my (many months faithful
attendance, plus a sponsor, over a couple of years) experience with AA: If
you do not follow the AA path 100%, you are hopeless, constitutionally
dishonest, a loser, will always drink, will always be a drunk, and win or
lose, AA people want nothing to do with you if you're not stepping and
working the program. People with whom I thought I'd developed a real
connection with in the AA-context wanted nothing to do with me if I wasn't
working the program. I was either a: hopeless and doomed if still drinking,
even sporadically, or if successful and happily sober: a threat to the
ideology and without that, even if you are happily sober/not using, you are
labeled a &quot;dry drunk.&quot;. People like Mike C. are totally the reason I quit
AA, totally the reason I am happy to be (so far) sober without AA, and
actually glad I left.

<p>
I'd be interested to hear from any AA people who are friendly with, and
supportive of, people in their lives who became and stayed sober
*without* AA. Is there such an animal?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I've heard of a few, but just a small very few. Many of them are in the
&quot;<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">Newcomers Rescue League</a>&quot;.

Oh well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	Re: Commentary on Amy's letters<br>

<p>
You know, I always wondered what would happen if AA, NA, and NicA held a
joint meeting. There would probably be a bunch of heated arguments over
what drugs are and aren't okay to use. Sure, it's the exact same shit, but
it's just like two identical churches arguing over whether to dunk or
sprinkle. Somebody needs to make this happen, so I can attend and record
that.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
That could be a real circus. The guys in A.A. say that smoking tobacco and shooting heroin is okay, just as long
as you don't drink while you do it. The N.A. guys say that smoking is okay just as long as you don't
shoot heroin while you do it. And the Nicotine Anonymous guys say that either nothing is okay, or it's all okay
except cigarettes. Yes, that would be an entertaining meeting.
<p>
I'd especially like to hear the lecture about &quot;You aren't sober if you are smoking cigarettes.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Actually, it might be fun to show up to random meetings and record what
goes on in them. I got a nice little digital voice recorder that's probably
the best thing Sony's ever made. It's got good sound quality, it plugs into
the computer via standard USB, the computer treats it like a normal flash
drive, and it runs on a standard AAA rechargeable battery. It looks a lot
like an iPod, too. I used it to record the professors back when I was in
college.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I've got some Olympus ones that do the same thing. They are amazing. 22 hours of recording time,
and they hear everything in the room, and they disappear in your pocket.

<p>
After all, it's one thing to read about the crazy. It's another to hear it
with your own ears.

<p>
Anyhow, now it's time for some commentary on
<a href="orange-letters323.html#Mike_C" target="_blank">Mike's letters</a>.

<p>
First of all, I must say I'm glad you know basic web design. Your site is
consistent, no matter what platform I use to view it.

<p>
And I really love how this guy came up with a ridiculous scenario for the
harm your site could do, but couldn't think of anything at all for the harm
AA could do. Here's a less ridiculous scenario for ya, Mike:
<p>
<ul>
<li> 1. Guy goes to AA meeting.
<li> 2. He gets to the 4th step.
<li> 3. He reads his personal inventory and decides he's a piece of shit.
<li> 4. He buys a gun from the pawn shop and kills himself.
</ul>

<p>
&quot;But it's not AA's fault the guy decided to kill himself!&quot;
<p>
<ul>
<li> 1. Girl recently decides to quit drinking and go to AA.
<li> 2. She meets a sponsor.
<li> 3. The sponsor hits on her.
<li> 4. Girl is still cloudy-headed, so doesn't know how to respond.
<li> 5. The sponsor invites her to his place and offers to teach her the 13th step.
<li> 6. Girl feels like she has to accept.
</ul>

<p>
&quot;But that's not AA! The book is all you need!&quot;
<p>
<ul>
<li> 1. An AA member happens to be a smoker.
<li> 2. Smoker reads <i>The Big Book</i>.
<li> 3. Smoker's wife tells him to quit smoking.
<li> 4. Smoker feels justified in throwing a tantrum that would put most toddlers to shame.
<li> 5. The smoker's wife leaves him.
<li> 6. Smoker develops lung cancer and dies.
</ul>

<p>
Come on, let's make this a game!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the laugh. Yes, that would make an interesting game.

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
Your orange paper has become quite popular in AA circles.
Many people with time up know about it.
I also know about it.

<p>
I am impressed by the depth of research in orange papers.
Just because it is in-depth or extensive I am not necessarily in agreement or
disagreement with each and every opinion/judgment.

<p>
To be clear, I am not here to criticize or praise your work in orange paper.

<p>
I am interested if you are going to do such an extensive critique of SMART recovery?
I wonder if you will ever write an orange paper on SMART recovery?
The reason is that you do have a critical mind's eye and you could do a great deal
of service to all people in recovery by writing an orange paper on SMART.

<p>
Kind regards<br>
Nawal

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Nawal,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question.
If someone does some valid tests of SMART or SOS or Lifering or anything like that, I will
happily publish the results.
<p>
I already have published the results of the one and only test that I
know of that was a valid
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</a>
of something like SMART &#8212; that is, of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma
did a three-way controlled study</a>, comparing 1) A.A., 2) CBT, and 3) no treatment.
CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) did the best. The resulting sobriety rate wasn't spectacular, but it was an improvement.
CBT gained a few percent more success stories, while A.A. drove the clients to drink. Literally.
After 9 months of &quot;treatment&quot;, the A.A. people were doing
five times as much binge drinking as the no-treatment group, and nine times the amount of binge drinking
that the CBT group was doing.  So the CBT group was doing less binge drinking than the no-treatment group.
<p>
Several years ago, someone asked me why I don't accuse SMART or SOS or Lifering
of being cults.  I answered that question at length there:<br>
<a href="orange-letters7.html#not_cult" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters7.html#not_cult</a>
<p>
Beyond that, I feel no great need to do a big expos&eacute; of SMART or SOS or Lifering for several
good reasons:

<ol>
<li> They do not conspire with judges and therapists to get people sentenced to their organization.
<li> They do not put on airs of having a program that was divinely inspired by God.
<li> They base their programs on valid science and modern medicine, rather than on
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">the ravings of a pro-Nazi Lutheran minister</a>.
<li> They do not insist that you must surrender your life to a &quot;god&quot; or
&quot;higher power&quot; who can be anything from a bedpan to a doorknob, or a
Golden Calf to a stone idol.
<li> They do not lie about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">their success and failure rates</a>.
<li> They do not
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think" target="_blank">suppress dissent</a>,
 or
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_personal_attacks" target="_blank">personally attack critics</a>.
<li> Their founders were not lying thieving
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">sexual predators</a>
with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#grandiose" target="_blank">delusions of grandeur</a>
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">a Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>.
<li> They don't kill people by 
<a href="orange-letters319.html#no_meds" target="_blank">telling them not to take their doctor-prescribed medications</a>.
<li> They don't 
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">sexually exploit young women newcomers by assigning them to old men sponsors</a>.

</ol>
<p>
You know, compared to Alcoholics Anonymous, a big expos&eacute; of SMART or SOS or Lifering
would be downright boring. There just isn't the same spectacular dirt to dig up.
The only thing I've got on Dr. Albert Ellis, the founder of SMART and co-inventor of Cognitive Emotive Behavioral
Therapy, is that he likes to use a bunch of cuss words and obscenities in his lectures. That's it.

<p>
But if you do find anything, please let me know, and I'll investigate.
<p>
Have a good day now.

were you were talking about that this list not including murder or hypocricy.
<p>
&quot;NIDANAS&quot; is a list of &quot;Twelve Causes of Human Misery&quot;, it's a sanskrit word
(meaning this list comes then orginally from yoga philosophy).
<p>
To fill it up to 12 one could add fear, but Dr. Rampa did only mention 7;
&quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;.
<p>
Anyway I thought you'd be interested.


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
NIDANAS : These are known as the Twelve Causes of Misery.
<p>
There is no point in listing them in detail because they are
just things connected with material existence, such as lusts of
the flesh and all that sort of thing which seem to have been
specifically designed to keep poor suffering Man, and even more
suffering Woman, on this quite miserable Earth.
<p>
We should get rid of Nidanas as fast as we can. There are
such things in Nidanas such as pride, covetousness, lust, anger,
gluttony, envy, and sloth. These things are not desirable things,
we do not have to put up with them, and with a little effort
we can get rid of the whole bunch, and when we come to make
that effort we find it is not so hard as we thought, and then
we know we are well on the way to leaving this Earth-round
for good &#8212; and it certainly is good.

Hello Igor,
<p>
Thanks for the list. Now that's more. However, I notice that it still doesn't include murder.
<p>
That item is on my mind right now especially because of the mass murder that is going on in Syria.
I'm sure that the people in Syria are considering murder to be far more of a serious problem than
sloth or lust or gluttony.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Thank you!!
<p>
Honesty, such a valued concept in A.A., and I finally find it on your website 20
years after my indoctrination into A.A.
<p>
&quot;When the student is ready, the teacher appears&quot;

<p>
14 years ago, I was helping Searcy Whaley of Dallas Texas count money in a hotel
room at his &quot;Gathering of The Eagles&quot; A.A. Conference in Dallas. I asked Searcy,
&quot;How to you survive, do you have a retirement plan or annuity that supports you and
Margaret?&quot;
<p>
Searcy looked at me in amazement, then looked at the sixteen bags of cash
in the hotel room, and he said, &quot;Like Bill Wilson said, I live off the generosity of
others.&quot; He then began to laugh until his ribs hurt. He then said, &quot;This is IRS
501C3 tax exempt cash.... It doesn't even exist, take this bag down to my car and put
it in the trunk.&quot;
<p>
I didn't realize I was supposed to open the bag and help myself to what I wanted. I
was being &quot;groomed&quot; to take over &quot;The Gathering of The Eagles&quot; before Searcy died.
<p>
Bill Wilson was a con artist. He admits to it in his story in the big book. Ebby
Thatcher who sobered up at Searcy's Rehab hospital in Dallas, was offended he wasn't
the cofounder of AA. Bill needed a Doctors credentials for the con to sound
legitimate. So he used Dr. Bob.
<p>
Bill finally found his con.... and lived a very comfortable life from other peoples
generosity.

<p>
Bernie Madoff is quite envious, I'm sure.<br>
Bill Wilson got away with it.

<p>
And the con game continues.

<p>
Thanks Orange.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wow. Hello, D.K.,
<p>
Thanks for the revelation. And thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
I must confess that I didn't know anything about 
Searcy Whaley of Dallas Texas, and his
&quot;Gathering of The Eagles&quot; A.A. Conference.
<p>
That is so interesting that I shall have to investigate.
<p>
I knew that Ebby Thatcher went to a rehab in Texas, maybe several times, before finally ending up at
his &quot;final resting place&quot; in upper New York state &#8212; that is,
at the alky farm where he spent the last years of his life.
So Ebby was connected to Searcy Whaley in Texas before that, huh?
Interesting. Very interesting.
Now I have more learning to do.
<p>
(Maybe I read something about that in the biography of Ebby, but I forgot it.
Now that I look, I see a mention of Searcy W.,
<a href="orange-letters10.html#Ebby2" target="_blank">here</a>.
The book is
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Ebby" target="_blank"><i>Ebby: The Man Who Sponsored Bill W.</i></a>, by Mel B.,
which I shall have to read again.
Although I'm sure that Mel Barger would leave out any juicy stuff about corruption in A.A.)

<p>
If you would care to write up more of your experiences, it would be appreciated. That's the unwritten
history of A.A. that they don't want us to know about.

Subject: <a href="orange-deprogram.html" target="_blank">How To Deprogram Your Own Mind</a><br>

<p>
You had a great essay going here, but you missed the point of Bill
Wison's words. When he wrote &quot;left to those better qualified to handle
it&quot;, he had already explained that he was talking about &quot;Those of us in
AA&quot;. Most alcoholics are angry resentful people who will hold a grudge
or rationalize anger over minor upsets that ordinary people would just
shrug off. His advice was for these alcoholics, not the general population.

<p>
Obviously &quot;those better qualified to handle it&quot; are the 95% of society
that don't have issues with excessive anger. Please go back and read
Wilson's quote more carefully. There are plenty of examples of cults
that really do tell people their feelings are bad and wrong, maybe you
can use one of those With that correction this would be a very useful
document.

<p>

Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the note and the compliment. But I did not misunderstand what Bill was saying.
As usual, Bill Wilson was declaring that alcoholics are inferior subhumans, some real
<i>Untermenschen</i>.
Ordinary people may be qualified to handle anger and resentments, but not those dirty
alcoholics who join A.A.
<p>
A.A. routinely says that they want to reduce the stigma of alcoholism, but they don't.
That is a <i>reversal of reality</i>. The truth is,
A.A. works to increase the stigma of alcoholism by constantly harping on how bad those alcoholics are,
and selfish, and resentful, and unspiritual, and manipulative, and on and on. And those alcoholics are
totally undependable because they will relapse in one day
if they don't practice the A.A. cult religion every day...
That was the whole point of the file,
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i> Conspiracy</a>&quot;,
where Bill Wilson raved his contempt for alcoholics pretty much non-stop.

<p>
And you are doing it too, right now, in this letter:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Most alcoholics are angry resentful people who will hold a grudge
or rationalize anger over minor upsets...<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, you cannot stereotype alcoholics like that. That is just not true.
Alcoholics are not all the same. And alcoholics are not all despicable creeps or resentful angry loonies.
<p>
This keeps coming up, and I have to keep on mentioning it:
Like Penn &amp; Teller said in their TV
program on A.A.: &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has no respect for alcoholics.&quot; Look
here:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231351/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU2YliYttnQ&amp;feature=share" target="_blank">
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU2YliYttnQ&amp;feature=share</a>

<p>
And I'm happy to say that Bill Wilson was wrong, very wrong. The constant put-downs of alcoholics
were just part of his power game to make himself King of the Alcoholics, and make
everybody else feel guilty and weak and subservient.
Alcoholics are not inferior subhumans who are unable
to handle anger or resentments when con artists lie to them and cheat them.
Alcoholics are actually pretty much like normal people, except that they have a problem
with drinking too much alcohol for any of a dozen different reasons.
<p>
By the way, the word &quot;alcoholic&quot; is not even properly defined in A.A. Before we
call somebody an &quot;alcoholic&quot;, we should at least properly define what the word 
means. A.A. uses at least four different definitions of the word, and mixes them
up, which really confuses the issue. I just reprinted the definitions here:
<a href="orange-letters322.html#definitions" target="_blank">

Have a good day now.

Child of Gus from 2 years ago, hanging out at Dabblers' Marsh
</center>
This is an older kid of Gus who doesn't feel the need to hang out with Mom and Dad any more.
The way that I know for sure is the next picture: Gus's child from last year is still hanging out with its
parents. Canada Geese children usually stay with their parents for 2 years. Then, at age 2 1/2, they marry
for life.  This one doesn't have a mate yet. Once in a blue moon, I've seen this one go and hang out with
Gus or its younger sibling, but that is rare. Most of the time, this one is on its own now.
<p>
I have no idea what sex any of Gus's children are. Ordinarily, I can easily tell the boy and girl goslings apart
because the boys are so much bigger and heavier-set than the girls. But all of Gus's children are unusually
large and heavy-set, so that's no help.

<p>

This day, Gus showed up with a new brood of babies.
</center>
Gus is in front, and the mother, Gus's wife, is the female Canada Goose bringing
up the rear in the left foreground, and the odd-looking goose in the background
is their child from last year. And of course they have 5 new little ones.
<p>
Incidentally, notice how the adults have the babies surrounded by a triangle of adults.
That's not accidental. Canada Geese routinely arrange themselves in formations that
will keep the babies protected.

<p>
Gus disappeared for more than a month, and we were wondering if he died or got
eaten or something. Happily, no.  Gus's wife went way out back and built her
nest in a remote place, and he went with her to keep her company and protect her.
So the two of them were not to be seen while she laid her eggs and then sat on them.
Then, finally, this day they showed up with 5 new babies.

Gus telling off everybody else
</center>
Gus is declaring to all of the other geese that his babies are getting these oats,
and nobody else had better try to take any away from his kids. It's hard to see,
but there are rolled oats or oatmeal on the ground there  &#8212;  those little
white specks. I was putting out piles of oats or oatmeal here and there, and that's
why Gus and family came ashore.
<br>
The fifth baby is hard to see in this picture. It's hiding behind some weeds, in front of the mother's feet.
<p>
<center>
<img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/C5D_20120525_5333-Gus+Family-800.png" border="0" width="800" height="645" alt="Greylag Goose Family with goslings"><br>
Gus and Family
</center>
Gus is looking every inch the proud father in this picture.
<p>
Gus is also telling me that I had better be on my best behavior and not mess with his kids.
He trusts me pretty much, mostly, but he is still very wary and highly protective of his children.
Bringing his babies ashore in front of me is an act of great trust. He knows that I don't
intend to hurt them. But he still lets me know that I better not mess with his kids.
<p>
The mother is also surprisingly trusting for a wild goose. She has also had a couple of years to
get to know me, and see that I don't hurt geese or ducks. And I think she also takes Gus's word for it.
She trusts me because he trusts me.
<p>
Still, she is totally wild, and migrates south for the winter. Last winter, she flew
south and left Gus behind. Gus can't fly. He is just too heavy. But she returned to him in the spring,
and they had a bunch more kids together.  This has been going on for at least three years.

<p>
I find it funny to think that Gus married a wild girl. That statement is loaded with sexual implications and
double entendr&eacute;s of course. And Gus is doing his best to be a wild goose himself.
I can imagine him sitting up nights reading Jack London's <i>Call Of The Wild</i>, learning how to
become a wild creature.
He's doing a fair job of it. He wants nothing from humans except the occasional treat.
He's quite happy to take good munchies when he can get them, like now. And so is every other wild
creature around.
