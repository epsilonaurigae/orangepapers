Subject:  	sponsor<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I am German, I can read and understand your orange-papers perfectly, but I am not
good in writing in English.

<p>
I hope you can understand my story.

<p>
I had a husband. We knew each other for 35 years, we married 1998, our son was born
in 1998.

<p>
In the year 2004 my husband started to go to meetings of AA. He wanted to be an
alcoholic in recovery (without having been a real Alcoholic before &#8212; he just wanted
a cult that took control over his whole life). He spent a lot of time in
online-meetings. He found himself a sponsor. This sponsor took control. In the
following years, my husband stopped his lifelong friendships with ordinary people
from our daily life. He chose new friends or the sponsor chose for him. My husband
was not able to make decisions or choices about his business and family life. He
always had to ask his sponsor or the other AA-people.

<p>
He ruined his business as a cabinet maker / joiner. He left me and our son. He was
not able to see reality, especially his financial, economic situation. All he wanted
was: to be a full-time recovering alcoholic. He called these people his friends. But
you cannot find friends, when you see them only in the evenings in a meeting, where
everybody is telling just stories. To be friends, you need the experience of seeing
somebody in his everyday life.

<p>
In the end my husband dropped dead in his joiner&#39;s workshop &#8212; I think he knew
somehow that he had completely ruined his whole life. That happened in march 2012.
I waited more than one year, then I asked myself if this tragical story is finished
for me. I found out that it isn&#39;t.

<p>
2010 I wrote a warning letter to that sponsor and to AA Germany. I told them about
the danger. I knew my husband well enough to know about the risks. Afterwards I
found the reaction letter of AA Germany: they agreed with the sponsor, that I, the
wife, should attend Al-Anon-meetings, and they had not made any mistake. The sponsor
misunderstood my warning letter &#8212; oh she&#39;s just a jealous wife ..

<p>
There exist a few very interesting letters and I am thinking about legal steps and
talking to the newspapers. The 12steps lobby in Germany does exist, but I think it
is not so powerful like it is in the USA.

<p>
Thank you for your good work!

<p>
Sibylle

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sibylle,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your suffering. I'm adding this letter to
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. Horror Stories</a>.
<p>
What you have described is just so classic.
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_decision_making" target="_blank">Taking total control of a person's decision-making</a>
is just standard cult behavior  &#8212;  it's
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_decision_making" target="_blank">in the Cult Test</a>.
<p>
And people who voluntarily submit to such supervision are fleeing from freedom.
I think either Eric Hoffer or Eric Fromm wrote a book &quot;Flight From Freedom&quot;, about
people who seek escape from freedom. I shall have to make another attempt to find it.

<p>
Their reaction to your letter is also typical. They cannot believe that they
did anything wrong. It's unthinkable. They believe that
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">their group and their teachings
are always right</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong" target="_blank">you are always wrong</a>.
Yes, it's a cult.
<p>
You are right that the A.A. lobby in Germany is not as powerful as it is in the USA.
And A.A. would be even less popular in Germany if more people knew the true history of A.A., like that
the cult religion that became A.A. was created by a renegade Lutheran minister,
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">who thanked Heaven for giving us Adolf Hitler</a>.
And neither of the founders of A.A. in the USA &#8212; Bill Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith, or Clarence
Snyder &#8212; quit A.A. in protest when Dr. Buchman went to Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and
<i>Sieg-Heiled</i> Adolf Hitler, and praised Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.

<p>
All that those three founders did to create Alcoholics Anonymous was rename the
alcoholics' branch of Frank Buchman's cult religion to &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;
(Clarence Snyder made up that name), and change a few words, like changing
&quot;sin&quot; to &quot;alcohol&quot;.
Instead of Buchman's followers supposedly being defeated by sin and powerless over it,
A.A. followers were supposedly &quot;defeated by alcohol&quot; and powerless over it.  

<p>
We discussed that before in a previous letter, here:
<a href="orange-letters128.html#NCPA" target="_blank">
&quot;the &quot;benevolent&quot; support group AA has its roots in the Nazi regime.&quot;</a>

<p>
The story of Matthias getting sued by A.A. in Germany for producing his own German
inexpensive translation of the old out-of-copyright first edition of the <i>Big Book</i> is
also enlightening:

<p>
Yes, the German A.A. is just as corrupt as the American organization.

Have a good day and a good life now.

Hi Orange,
<p>
I know that you have covered the cult aspects of AA incredibly well on the
website but I thought that this article on cults would be a good addition
to an already great resource.<br>

<p>
I see from the letters section that your are using Baclofen. I just
wondered if you knew that Baclofen has been approved for the treatment of
alcoholism in France and there is lots of talk on the web of it being very
helpful for cocaine dependence.
<p>
Also, recently the NIAAA reported on positive reports for Ondansetron for
alcohol dependence based on studies by our old friend Dr. Bankole Johnson.<br>

Hello again, iamnotastatistic,
<p>
Thanks for all of the information.
<p>
Yes, I ran across the information about some doctors using Baclofen to treat alcohol abuse.
The dosage that they are using is like 10 or 20 times as much as I'm getting.
I don't know what that would feel like. The dose that I'm getting is so small that I'm
not sure if it's doing anything at all. I just assume that it must be taking the edge off
of muscle tremors and twitches.

<p>
Still, the idea of using a muscle relaxant to treat alcohol abuse is an interesting one.

<p>
I'll have to check out those other two links.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<h2>The Fall of the American Empire Has Begun</h2><br>
<h3>An interview with Richard Maybury</h3>

<p>
<b>The Daily Crux</b>: Richard, you've long said the collapse of the American
Empire would be the central issue for Americans, with regard to money,
investing, and life in general.

<p>
In your recent issue of <i>Early Warning Report</i>, you said there's now a very
high probability this collapse has already started. Can you talk about why
you think that is?

<p>
<b>Richard Maybury</b>: Let's start with a little history: All empires
eventually fall. No one in Washington will admit it, but the U.S. has been
an empire for decades now, and there has never been any reason to believe
our empire would be immortal.

<p>
People who are power-seekers want more power, and they'll sacrifice other
things in order to get that power. One of the things power-seekers in a
large government almost always sacrifice is the financial integrity of the
country. They will bleed the whole economy dry just to increase their
power. That's a main reason empires fall.

<p>
We see it all through history. You can look back to any of the ancient
empires... They're forever wrecking their economies in order to increase
their political power. So it's no brilliant prediction to say the U.S.
Empire is going to fall. Anyone who has studied much history should have
been able to predict this mess was going to arise... and here it is.

<p>
It's fascinating to me. I talk to all sorts of so-called ordinary people,
such as dentists, barbers, and taxi drivers. Most have no understanding of
what's actually happening to America, but they all know deep in their
hearts something has gone terribly wrong... and it's not going to end anytime
soon. This is an interesting condition that has arisen recently.

<p>
Americans, up until the last year or two, have always been optimistic. They
would say things like, &quot;Yes, hard times come along, but this, too, shall
pass.&quot; They aren't saying this anymore. They're beginning to figure out
that America's troubles aren't going away this time.

<p>
You can see these problems in the financial markets and elsewhere...
unemployment, bankruptcies, mortgage defaults, poverty... These are all just
symptoms of the fall of the empire. Let me quickly point out, however, that
the fall of the empire is actually a wonderful thing. Empires are cancers,
and it's a good thing to excise them as fast as possible. But the surgery
necessary to do it is awfully painful.

<p>
If you look at any previous empires I write about &#8212; the French Empire, the
British Empire, the Russian Empire &#8212; these countries are all much better
places today than they were when they had empires. America will be too. But
we've got to get from here to there... and the process is very, very painful.
We're going to experience an awful lot of trouble because of it.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: For many years, you've also been writing about the problems in the
Middle East. In the past few months, it seems many of those problems are
coming to a head. Can you explain how the troubles there &#8212; part of the area
you refer to as &quot;Chaostan&quot; &#8212; are related to the troubles we're facing here
at home?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: Sure. For those who aren't familiar, &quot;Chaostan&quot; is a term I
coined for the area from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, and Poland
to the Pacific, along with North Africa. This area includes the Middle East.

<p>
In Central Asia, the suffix &quot;stan&quot; means &quot;the land of.&quot; For example,
Afghanistan is the land of the Afghans. So in 1992, I coined the term
Chaostan to mean &quot;the land of great chaos.&quot;

<p>
The reason this area is so often in chaos is a conversation of its own, but
here's a quick summary.

<p>
All religions teach that there is a higher law than any government's law,
and they all teach two fundamental laws: Do all you have agreed to do,
which is the basis of contract law, and do not encroach on other persons or
their property, which is the basis of tort law and some criminal law. Each
religion expresses these laws in different ways, but they all teach them.

<p>
These principles are the basis of the old British common law. It was called
common law because it grew out of principles common to all.

<p>
In a book called <i>The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution</i>,
historian Bernard Bailyn pointed out that the American Revolution, the
Constitution, Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence all sprang
from the common law.

<p>
In the decades following the revolution, other people saw America's new
liberty and prosperity. They wanted the same thing, and the American
philosophy began to spread around the world. The areas where it took root
became known as the &quot;Free World.&quot;

<p>
Then in the mid-1800s, socialism began to spread, and it nearly killed off
the American philosophy &#8212; a philosophy that I believe is now being
rediscovered.

<p>
Chaostan is the most important area where the principles of liberty never
got a chance to take root. From the beginning of history, most parts of
Chaostan have been a sea of blood and destruction because they never had
rational legal systems... and still don't.

<p>
The turmoil is greatly aggravated by the interference of European regimes
during past centuries.

<p>
When you look at this area on a map of the world, you see all these
countries are delineated by borders drawn by Europeans. Very few Americans
understand this. Practically every border in the world was drawn by the
European governments as they swept over the globe conquering one country
after another.

<p>
European rulers would draw the borders in locations that were convenient to
them. And so there are very few borders in the world that were drawn by the
people who are native to those areas.

<p>
This means what we regard as a country when we look at a map usually isn't
really a country at all. It's a collection of tribes cobbled together by
the Europeans for the convenience of the Europeans.

<p>
In each of these so-called &quot;countries,&quot; there are some tribes that are
either dominant or want to be dominant. And the way they achieve dominance
is by acquiring money, weapons, and other resources from outside powers,
which were originally the Europeans.

<p>
A good example is Saudi Arabia. The Saudi tribe was one of many that lived
on the Arabian Peninsula. The British government essentially created Saudi
Arabia by giving money and weapons to the Saudi tribe and helping them take
control of the other tribes.

<p>
This would be akin to China or some other foreign country coming to the
United States and choosing single families or neighborhoods to rule over
entire states. These families would have all the wealth, all the power, and
would make all the rules. And just in case anyone got any ideas, the
Chinese government would keep a few battleships and aircraft carriers
parked near our shores.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: We're huge fans of your <i>Uncle Eric</i> books here at <i>The Crux</i>, and
I remember being blown away the first time I read that example. We're not
taught these things in our schools... But when you look at it from that
perspective, it's not surprising there's so much anger toward Western
governments.

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: Exactly... and this is the case all over Chaostan. None of those
nations are what you and I would regard as natural countries. They were
artificially created, and the rulers of those countries were propped up, in
nearly every case, by the Europeans.

<p>
Keep in mind that except for five countries  &#8212;  Iran, Thailand, Afghanistan,
most of China, and Japan  &#8212;  every country in the world at one time or
another was conquered by the Europeans. So the political structures we see
in these countries  &#8212;  nearly all countries  &#8212;  are either creations of the
Europeans or outgrowths of those creations.

<p>
During and after World War II, some of these tribal leaders wanted help
maintaining their power after the Europeans departed. The U.S. was the top
dog at that time, so they said to Washington, &quot;We will do your bidding &#8212; we
will be your surrogate here &#8212; if you do what's necessary to keep us in
power.&quot;

<p>
That's the deal that was made with dozens of regimes around the world.
That's the U.S. Empire, and that's what is falling apart now. The people
who have been dominated by tribes backed by Washington are sick of it, and
they're starting to overturn the existing political matrix.

<p>
So the troubles in the Middle East are to a large extent part of the
collapse of the empire. For instance, Hosni Mubarak in Egypt was one of
Washington's closest surrogates... and he was a nasty guy. He's out of power
now, and Egypt is in great turmoil. Nobody knows who's going to take over
the place.

<p>
That's just one example out of many. The whole thing is beginning to
crumble. Egypt was one of the early cases, and I think there are going to
be a lot more.

<p>
Even nations that were not part of the U.S. Empire are being thrown into
chaos, as the spirit of rebellion spreads.

<p>
As of a couple weeks ago, I think there are now 11 countries over there
experiencing uprisings of one kind or another. I expect this is going to
continue to spread.

<p>
It's very possible Egypt will wind up being the model for what happens in
many of those countries... where you have a U.S.-backed dictator who is
overthrown and then so-called Islamic fundamentalists come in and take
over. That's very likely what's going to happen in Egypt.

<p>
Obviously, I don't know for sure... no one should be certain about these
things. But I'm inclined to believe the Egyptian government is going to be
replaced by something that will not be friendly to Washington.

<p>
Again, however, we're really on thin ice when it comes to making
predictions about these sorts of things. Egypt contains many millions of
people, each with his own agenda. Predicting how all that's going to go is
very, very problematic.

<p>
What I can say with confidence is the political matrix Washington put in
place during and after World War II is now crumbling. I think that's pretty
clear. And again, I return to the point: This is ultimately a good thing.
The U.S. Empire should never have existed in the first place.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: Why did the U.S. get involved in Chaostan to begin with?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: I believe it really just goes back to the lust for power. That's
one thing the mainstream news media is absolutely derelict about... They say
practically nothing about political power.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: Could you define political power for us?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: Perhaps the simplest definition is &quot;the legalized privilege of
using brute force on persons who have not harmed anyone.&quot; This privilege is
what sets governments apart from all other institutions. No church,
charity, fraternal organization, or any other institution can legally send
people with guns to your home to force you to buy their services or obey
their rules. Only the government can do that. And whether they realize it
or not, it's this privilege &#8212; of using force on persons who don't deserve
it &#8212; that a power-seeker wants.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: Is that related to the old saying that power corrupts?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: Very astute of you to make that connection. If the American
founders were here today, they'd tell us political power is poison... Stay as
far from it as you can... It's evil stuff.

<p>
But the media have bought into this assumption that political power is
good, it's the solution to our problems, and a world full of political
power is a good place. They almost never look into the psychology of it...
What causes a human being to want to force his will on other people?
Because that's what political power essentially is &#8212; the ability to bend
other people to your will. And the media just don't look at that at all.

<p>
There's this assumption that the people in the federal government are a
whole lot of nice individuals who have good intentions, and it would never
occur to any of them to get a thrill out of forcing their plans onto
somebody else.

<p>
But that's what it's all about, and that's what it's been about for
thousands of years. Government is brute force. Coercion. Chains. Prisons.
Follow our plans or else. The political mind is the mind of a bully.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: We often hear the U.S. is involved in the Middle East because of
oil... How big a role does oil actually play?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: I think oil is an excuse. I don't think it's a reason for the
empire. Whoever owns the oil has to sell it or it's worthless.

<p>
They may not want to sell it directly to us, but they're going to sell it
to somebody. This will increase the total world supply of oil, and the
price of oil from other suppliers will go down.

<p>
So the idea that this is all about oil... that's just a smokescreen. It's
about power. It's about the thrill that these people in Washington get out
of meddling in other countries.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: You mentioned before that it's very difficult to make predictions.
But what do you see happening next in the region?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: As far as that's concerned, I refer to Egypt again. The friends
of Washington are widely hated by their own people, and they will be coming
under pressure to hit the road.

<p>
Look what happened to the Shah of Iran back in the late '70s. I think it's
going to happen to pretty much all of Washington's surrogates. Like I said,
it's a fool's game to try to predict these things, but that's the direction
events are going now, and that's the direction I've been predicting since
the early 1990s.

<p>
Before the Soviet Empire fell apart, the Soviet Union sat on Chaostan like
a lid on a pressure cooker. One of the forces at work there was the
individual tribes that ruled these countries did not want to be conquered
by the Soviets, so they formed alliances with Washington as a protection
against the Soviets. When the Soviet Union fell in the early '90s, this
essentially removed the lid on the pressure cooker. The explosion began,
and now it's escalating.

<p>
In the 1990s, the rest of the world was cheering a new era of peace and
brotherly love... and I was saying, &quot;That's ridiculous. The whole place is
going to blow up.&quot; Everybody said I was crazy, and I kind of wondered if
maybe I was.

<p>
But it turned out that by the year 2000 &#8212; a mere 10-year stretch of the new
era of peace and brotherly love &#8212; more than 100 wars broke out and more
than 5 million people were killed.

<p>
I think what's happening today is just the beginning of what will turn out
to be even more violent than the '90s. There are literally hundreds of
millions of really angry people over there, and a rebellious momentum is
growing.

<p>
Again, I'm really reluctant to make specific forecasts on this kind of
thing. All you can say is governments have been creating empires since the
beginning of history, and empires have been falling apart since the
beginning of history... We're in one of those &quot;falling apart&quot; periods now.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: Do you think the individuals in power in Washington realize the
empire is crumbling? Do they even realize it's an empire?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: Well, it's official U.S. policy that Washington does not have an
empire. Everybody is taught that.

<p>
But just a couple months ago, President Obama phoned up Mubarak in Egypt
and fired him. If that's not an empire, what is it?

<p>
Now, Obama has decided the Libyan government should change, too. These
people in Washington seem to think they're ordained by God to somehow make
the world better.

<p>
I think it's amazing they believe they're intelligent enough to be able to
do that. It's actually pretty hilarious.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: So as the empire begins to crumble, how do you think Washington
will respond?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: I think we'll see more examples of Washington trying to steer
events in directions favorable to Washington. Notice I'm not saying
favorable to America. I'm saying favorable to the U.S. government. They are
two entirely different things.

<p>
Of course, the people in Washington are all individuals. They all have
their own agendas. They can't even agree on what's favorable to the
government.

<p>
So they're all grasping at straws. They have no idea what they should
really do in a situation like this. There are no guidelines. And since they
don't even want to acknowledge they have an empire, they don't understand
what it is they're trying to save.

<p>
I mean, talk about a bunch of lost souls. They seem to think being elected
means they have some sort of special ethical position in the world. They
have no idea what it is they're trying to defend. All they know is they're
trying to defend it.

<p>
Typically, in every empire, it all continues until one day somebody looks
at the books and says, &quot;Gee, we're broke. We can't do this anymore.&quot; That's
when it all starts to come apart.

<p>
One of my favorite stories is about William Gladstone &#8212; the prime minister
of England in the mid-1800s &#8212; and that's essentially what he did. He just
said, &quot;Look, we're going broke trying to prop up this empire. This is
ridiculous.&quot;

<p>
He started dismantling the British government's power. He probably made
more progress in abolishing political power than any other lone individual
in history. It's an amazing story.

<p>
Gladstone is one of the few peaceful examples of how all empires go down.
They eventually realize they can't play the game anymore. They realize
they've exhausted their resources... They've bled the population dry.

<p>
Humans can only produce so much wealth, and the government is consuming
this wealth in order to prop up the empire. Eventually, it all just goes
under.

<p>
Incidentally, we're talking here today about the federal government's
empire abroad... But America itself, internally, is part of the federal
empire, too. There are no less than a quarter-million federal bureaucrats
making and enforcing regulations on us. And each of these regulations is
backed by guns, chains, and prisons. It's not much of an exaggeration to
say the whole world &#8212; including America itself &#8212; has been conquered by the
federal government.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: How close do you think we are to the point where the empire
collapses the economy?

<p>
<b>Maybury:</b> My best guess is we're in the process of going under now. That's
the economic trouble the average American is noticing... the unemployment,
the business failures, the financial crash, the real estate collapse... plus
the mental and emotional strain &#8212; the psychological depression, marital
problems, divorces. It's the process of the empire going under. The
economic problems are symptoms of the manipulation of the currency, and all
sorts of other economic tomfoolery, to try to keep the federal bureaucracy
well fed at the expense of the rest of us.

<p>
The absolute best thing Washington could do for the American people &#8212; if
the folks in Washington were honest &#8212; is just announce that the empire is
over. &quot;It's finished, we quit.&quot; We're going to withdraw our troops from all
those countries around the world. We're going to bring them home to defend
America. We're not going to meddle in other countries anymore.

<p>
After all, this attempt to keep the Empire alive is just squandering blood
and treasure for nothing. We're bankrupt. We can't do this anymore. The
attempt to preserve the empire &#8212; which means, largely, the attempt to keep
Washington's surrogates in power &#8212; is just dragging out the whole painful
process and making it all the more expensive and hopeless.

<p>
If they'd just give it up, that would be the first big step in triggering
the economic recovery. But they're not going to do it. They're power
junkies. They'll drag this thing out until &#8212; in the words of political
philosopher Howard Kershner &#8212; the last bone of the last taxpayer has been
picked bare.

<p>
<b>Crux</b>: So what are the personal and investment implications of the fall of
the American Empire? How do you recommend people prepare for what you see
coming?

<p>
<b>Maybury</b>: First and foremost, you should have a good stash of emergency
equipment and supplies. Everybody should have these things anyway, because
you never know what's going to happen, be it earthquakes, riots,
hurricanes, riots, epidemics, riots, blizzards &#8212; did I mention riots?

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Matt,
<p>
Thanks for the interview. Now that is very interesting.
<p>
I agree with Richard Maybury's basic premise of the American Empire coming apart and falling down.
And I agree that the so-called &quot;leaders&quot; are really men who are addicted to power.
They believe that they must run the world or the world will run them. (There might even
be some truth to that.)
<p>
Something that Maybury did not mention is the fact that very rich and powerful men own
and run the corporations that make the
decisions to dominate impoverished foreign countries and extract their raw materials
and pay little for them. Much of the American wealth was actually taken that way.

<p>
I disagree with how Richard Maybury downplays
oil. Petroleum is absolutely essential to our industrial civilization and without it,
nothing works right.  Oil is both a chemical feed stock and an energy source.
Without oil, it will all come to a screeching halt.
And the world is running out of oil. We are just fresh out of dinosaurs (and Jurassic vegetation).

<p>
We use oil as the raw material for everything from plastics to medicines to
insecticides and fertilizers to grow our food. Then we use it as fuel to move the
food into the cities. Almost everything that moves is powered by oil. (Coal converted
into electricity powers only a few trolley cars and subway trains,
and a handful of electric family cars.)
<p>
We even use oil as the energy that builds other forms of energy,
like nuclear and solar. Diesel powers the bulldozers that dig the uranium ore, and
the trucks that drive it to the refinery, which is also petroleum-powered.
Then more petroleum-powered vehicles carry the finished fuel rods to the reactor,
which was also built with petroleum power.
<p>
Extremely-highly-refined chemicals and solvents that were made from petroleum
are used to process silicon which makes the
purified silicon wafers that become microcomputers and silicon solar cells. And the
machines which make silicon wafers into integrated circuits were also built with
petroleum energy and parts made with more petroleum.
<p>
Without oil, none of that happens.

<p>
Around 1998 to 2000, the price of oil was hovering in the $10 to $14 a barrel range.
Now it's in the $100 to $140 range. That is ten times more expensive. Our economy and
our industrial civilization were built on the basis of cheap oil.  The highway system,
the automotive industry, the division of cities into inner core and outer suburbia,
all depend on cheap oil. The mass production of food depends on oil, and transporting it into the
cities depends on oil. The railroads and airlines depend on cheap oil.
Expensive oil is bleeding the lifeblood out of the system.

<p>
So how is any of this relevant to the Orange Papers? Well, for starters, I find
Richard Maybury's descriptions
of men addicted to power to be accurate.  They totally crave power and they are <i>in denial</i>
about it. They will do crazy things, even suicidal things, to continue to
feed their addiction, which they call &quot;the American way of life&quot;.
They rationalize their behavior and even consider it virtuous.
They minimize and deny the problem, and insist that they don't need to change their ways.
They even insist that they are doing the right thing, as their lives fall apart.
And as they harm others.

<p>
This is also relevant to the Orange Papers because we all live in this crazy world that they have made.
I don't see much joy in getting unaddicted to alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, only to
freeze and starve in the dark.
Me, I keep an ax and a bowsaw in the closet.
And I have plenty of pocket knives and sharpening stones.
Now maybe that's just because I lived on a hippie commune, and I'm familiar with that lifestyle.
I can see going back to chopping wood and gardening. That lifestyle is workable, at least for me.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Terry, I just saw your photo of &quot;the pepper&quot; from your garden in the most recent
letters.  That looks to me like what we used to call &quot;ground cherries.&quot;  There is a
round seed inside that is juicy and makes great preserves.  However, the plant stem
and leaves don't quite look like the ones I knew back in the Blue Ridge Mtns. that
my grandmother's made into preserves, or quite like the plants we have here in the
Rockies that are similar.  The shell is paper-like and fluffs off in the wind
sometimes.  Deer are fond of them when ripe out here.  I once looked up ground
cherries and think I recall there are many varieties in the US.

<p>
Anyway, hope your pain is better, and congrats on the great work you continue to do
and number 13.  I just passed 32 years last month.

Hello Sober by Choice,

Thanks for the note. Wow. 32 years. That must feel like an eternity. That's been so long

just imagine it in the previous century?&quot; (Just kidding.)

<p>
About the &quot;peppers&quot;: I'll have to check that out. Whatever they are, they are supposed to be
good to eat. Last spring, some people were giving away some surplus garden plants,
and I got tomatoes and &quot;peppers&quot;.
They didn't know what kind of peppers they were. I assumed that they must be either
green chili peppers or green bell peppers. Or maybe little red-hot peppers.
But whatever these plants are, they are not any of those.
<p>
Well, the tomatoes were really tomatoes, and they are good and tasty. 
All of the plants flourished in my back yard. Not a single one died.
Now I need to figure out what to do with these &quot;peppers&quot;.

Have a good day now.

Hello, Orange.

<p>
You never replied to the forwarded message below. :) But never mind.

<p>
I would like to add another &quot;argument&quot; that addictive voice (lizard brain)  makes in
order to consume again. It's this:

<p>
 &#8212; You'll have to consume in the future, so you might as well consume now.

<p>
Example:<p>
<ul>
<li>
 &#8212; You can't stop drinking for good. In some moment in the future you'll be offered a
drink and you will have to drink it because of the social pressure. So you just
might as well drink now.

<p>
<li>
 &#8212; You can't stop looking at porn for good. I mean, you just go to any drugstore and
you are surrounded with suggestive magazines, and the Internet is even worse. You
just can't stop looking, come on. So you might as well just look now.
</ul>
<p>
I hope this is useful to your website!

Thanks,<br>

Hello, mr. Orange.

<p>
Just wanted to add another &quot;strategy&quot; that Lizard Brain will use to get its
'fix'. It happens to me (a sex addict) a lot, and it is:

<p>
* So you need to be totally clean... But you just looked a little bit. Oh, OK,
you're not clean anymore. You might as well get on a sex binge now!!

<p>
I guess for an alcoholic could it be something like:

<p>
* So you need to be totally sober... But you just thought about drinking... or you
accidentally drank a little bit of wine that was offered to you. Oh, OK, you're not
clean anymore. You might as well get totally drunk now!!

<p>
The fallacy here is, of course, the Perfect solution fallacy, also known as the
Nirvana fallacy. This is the prominent argument of my lizard brain while I am on a
binge.

I am at a point that I would like to put a lot of this behind me. I wish
there was some thing I could do to help the people caught up in this. From
what I can see, people just move on. I think that is why there are not to
many people against AA on the sites and forums. I think that is why AA gets
away with it's bs.

<p>
From what I could see the people in the program for the most part have
serious mental health problems and personality disorders. And then there
are those that have had those types of people in there lives feel right at
home with them. I do not know what to do except to just get away. The thing
that tells me that some thing is wrong is when I feel drained. I am putting
a lot of effort in and getting nothing back. It is very delusional, you
think some thing is going on, but it is all in your head. That is how the
person with NPD does it. They get you to do all the work. That is what the
12 step program is all about. Diabolical, if I may say so.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Subhuti,
<p>
Yes. Just yes. You've got it. You understand. And I agree that just getting away
is the best solution to the problem. You just don't need problems like that
in your life.
<p>
So have a good day now.

More twelve step propaganda. They never rest. Oooh, my compulsive sexual behaviour
is a disease, so I don't even need to try to exercise personal responsibility and
self-control. What a self-serving crock. It's sad to see good actors debasing
themselves with this rubbish.

Hello again, Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the link.
<p>
Just this line alone is hilarious. It sounds like a droll satire:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
&quot;...attendees at a self-help group as they fight courageously with an
inability to keep mickies in pants.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Heck, it's much funnier than members of Overeaters Anonymous courageously fighting donuts.
<p>
I notice that the review just slams the movie:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
... this poorly written, valiantly acted film allows no such escape from psycho-baloney.
It's like watching a horror film that demands the viewer actually believe in the
existence of ghosts. Where will this obfuscation of responsibility end?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well somebody has his head screwed on straight.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Dear Orange,

<p>
Again, I have more crap I wish to dump.   I like hearing what you have to
say.

<p>
I've been thinking how the AA religion brainwashed me.  After reading
accounts and also going to your (the Orange) site reading how cults
operate, presently for me, any widely held and read dogmatic scripture or
otherwise that says this right way will get you results (to heaven) or this
wrong way gets you to hell.... *plucks my nerves*!

<p>
Presently, I'm pondering how to get over three decades of AA cult
thinking.   I drink too much, know that, and now begin to understand I can
change that if I want..... but after three decades of doom-thinkin, its
gonna take some effort and time.   I'm one of those people who needs other
people to help me out of a hole, but I don't know who to trust &#8212;  given what
I've been reading recently.

<p>
I just read a list of Major Areas of Post-cult Adjustments. I'm hearing I
need to do some cult deprogramming and wondering how one goes about that?

<p>
Too, and basically, all this info is aimed at people who are self actuated,
that is, they can determine what is right or wrong for them.  I never was
very good at that.  Thru AA, it was easily hammered home that I don't know
what's good for me, I am powerless.... not only over an incurable a
disease, but I'm a very bad person too, and if I don't follow their program,
I'm gonna die of all of the above.... via the lack of a &quot;spiritual&quot;
(religious) program of recovery (AA).   At this point, I feel bad, but at
least I know I'm not bad.   I'm more daunted and confused than anything
else.

<p>
Somehow, I needta turn three decades of overlearned prophecy and lingering
dogma around.... and I don't exactly know how.... nor can I
completely fathom what the other side of that damn &quot; AA prophecy&quot; looks
like?   And, what the hell am I getting myself into this time?  Is this
another scam?

<p>
What has held me together for many years is a Bible parable about how God
separates the wheat from the chaff.   God keeps the wheat and the chaff
goes in the fire.   I thawt this meant that God throws sinners into the
fire (hell) and the others (if any) went to heaven.   What I now understand
it to mean is that God takes each individual and separates what fear-based
reasoning and behavior is over-learned and absorbed while here on Earth &#8212; 
and throws all that into the fire.   What is left must be the opposite of
fear &#8212;   Love.  I imagine there is no recognition of self anymore.... that
all our addictions and mean shit we did in life, etc.... God throws that
corruption into the fire, forgotten, gone.   What is left is who or what we
really are..... energy of some sort?   I think this happens even to the
likes of Adolf Hitler.

<p>
This, of course, goes against the tenets of human thinking.   After death,
bad people should be punished... in, preferably, an inferno.   Is this the
design God, who has better shit to do, would  make to keep people acting
nice while alive on planet Earth?   I don't think so.  Only humans could
dream this dogma up on a massive enough scale that its believed all over
the world.  Like AA, it doesn't work.... just the opposite in my
opinion.  However, it appears to me the threat of hell does work well for
control freaks, those who want things run their way, and only their way.
The only hell I know about is the one here on Earth because of them....
and, as it occurs to me,  and tho I am but a mere victim, I include
myself due to my own ignorance and stupidity.  After all, down here, we all
draw from the same pool of ignorance.

<p>
I pray that after death, there is nothing terrestrially trauma-influenced
anymore.  Its all good (total no recall).... and certainly not the harps
and clouded heaven or woeful-souls in hell crap we're lead to believe.
Mark Twain got that right.

Hello Matt,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Your description of &quot;purification by fire&quot; reminds me of the process
of purification of the mind that the Buddhists describe as happening in meditation or death.
They also occasionally use the fire image. The individual personality is gradually
burned away, leaving only pure awareness, without a personal history or a
list of good deeds and sins.  
<p>
By the way, do you have a link for that &quot;list of Major Areas of Post-cult Adjustments&quot;? I'm curious.

<p>
Have a good day now.

I did not get a URL for the &quot;list of Major Areas of Post-cult Adjustments&quot;, but a Google search
yielded this, which is probably what he was talking about:<br>

That is a page by none other than Janja Lalich, Ph.D, who also co-wrote a bunch of books about
cults with Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer of University of California at Berkeley, who was a reknowned
expert on cults and brainwashing. (Look
