Orange head or whatever you call yourself. I am so amazed at how much energy that
you have put into this. I suspect you have some serious underlying issues that AA
really brought up in you and you are so desperate to make AA wrong so you can escape
that awakening. Before you analyze what I have written here. I will not talk about
my education on the topic matter as far as schooling goes. I will say that I have
been attending AA for 35 years now. I have been to well over 3 thousands meetings of
AA. So I do know a thing or two about AA and what it is about and you have been to
well it cant be more then 2 meetings because 80% of what you claim about AA is so
eroneous it boggles my mind where you came up with such falsehoods. Like AA
recruiters? Dude there is no such thing as an AA recruiter? LMAO There are only
people who try as part of what helps them stay sober try to talk with anyone who is
intrested. Attraction rather then promotion. Oh sure there are
a few that may try to promote and maybe recruite? (never seen that though) but just
because you may have run into a person who claims to be an AA recruiter you think
that is absolute proof thaqt AA recruits? Good God man check yourself. I only read
a paper that is so twisted from reality from a very angry and hurt man who is
trying to avenge his hurt by making up stuff about those that hurt him. but I tell
you the majority of people(both in and not in AA) that I know can see this  is
nothing but a tremendous attempt to resolve his inner conflict because of a bad
experisnce he had at an AA meeting. I really do feel sorry for you and hope you
find the peace that you are so desperately wanting but trying to get in a way that
will ensure it never comes.

Hello Jay,
<p>
Yes, you drank the koolaid.
<p>
You start off with the standard
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>ad hominem</i></a>
attack because you can't imagine that someone
who is not mentally ill could possibly criticize Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Then you parrot
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">
the standard lies about &quot;no recruiting, no promotion, just attraction.&quot;</a><br>
(Just out of curiosity, how many slips have you signed in your 35 years? Those people with
those slips are not there voluntarily.)
<p>
Then you go back to claiming that I must be mentally ill to criticize A.A.
<p>
And you finish with hoping that I find peace.
Oh, so sanctimonious.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Ms. Orange,

<p>
What the hell is wrong with you, and what are you so afraid of? That people
may actually get help? And so what if they come to believe in a power greater
than themselves? Where is the harm? Do you really believe that the goal of AA
is  to brainwash people into going to church or something?
<p>
Luckily, the answer is that  sobriety, sanity, and a kernal of
spirituality has been restored to literally  millions from AA, enabling people to put
back the pieces of shattered lives  enough to restore some trust with their
loved ones and have something of a real  life again.
<p>
You sound like an angry, bitter, twisted wretch of  a soul who could use
AA to regain the light in your own life, unless maybe you  have something
better to offer........

From:  	&quot;Mongoose&quot; <br>
Subject:  	re: the whole naggy housewife idea<br>

<p>
So I just started looking through your site .. very interesting. :)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mongoose,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
Sorry to take so long to answer it; I'm really backlogged on email.
</font>
<p>
But I did want to make one note (might make more as I read on...), regarding the
whole &quot;it's my wife's fault I keep drinking!&quot; crap.
<p>
While I think that it is just an excuse for a person to keep drinking, there is some
sense to it (given the right context at least).

<p>
So, my mother is an alcoholic, and she has been trying very hard to lessen how much
she drinks. She still slips, sometimes, of course (I think she's got an addictive
personality, and that never helps), but she's working on it. However, one of the
things that sometimes will drive her to drinking is ... my dad! Now, this may be an
extreme example, but he is a very, very controlling person. He often treats my
mother like a child, and not like a wife. When he notices that she has a glass of
wine or anything, he will sometimes just emotionally degrade her (or, if she says
something he perceives to be fallacious, and he knows she's had so much as a beer,
he'll start talking about &quot;oh, yeah, just drink some more beer&quot;). And, he is rather
closed-minded, and doesn't really bother to actually hear her out. As I said, he's
very critical and controlling in every manner, but especially clings on to her
alcoholism.
<p>
So of course, this will just piss my mother off and depress her, since she has to
deal with his shit every day (and plus has to deal with her controlling and sick
mother, at the same time). And ... what do you know; she pours herself another
glass. And maybe another, and another. (Really depends on the situation how much she
drinks.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds like a really sad situation.
</font>
<p>
Now while it certainly is still her decision to drink, my dad being angry at her for
it and trying to make her not drink is very counteractive. I think that might be
what the counselor or whoever you were talking about was getting at; the alcoholic
needs to be given *some* space to work things out for themselves, or it just becomes
a horrific frustration.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I agree.  Such hostile criticism is definitely counter-productive. It didn't work on me either, when people yelled
at me and demanded that I quit drinking. I never quit in response to such criticism. I didn't quit until
I got to a place where I saw what damage and pain alcohol and tobacco were causing me, and I came to the
logical conclusion that it was more pain that it was worth. Over the years, the damage and pain had steadily increased,
while the pleasure and fun had diminished, and it just wasn't worth it any more.
<p>
You mention a counselor. That sounds like a good idea, IF you can get a good one, which is not easy. (I've seen more
quacks than good ones.)
Unfortunately, your father sounds like he would not be open to the idea, or even
seriously consider the idea that he was part of the problem.
</font>
<p>
Like I said, might be a somewhat extreme example, as I don't think most spouses are
just downright assholes to their alcoholic other, but might want to make note of
that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>
Oh, and another thing &#8212; I'm not sure if you have this written anywhere, but for
addictive drugs that give you withdrawal, and that build up tolerance or anything, I
recently learned that there is actually a specific chemical reason for addiction and
withdrawal symptoms, beyond just the drive to &quot;feel good.&quot;
<p>
Anyway, say you have a drug you're taking too much, and which bind to certain
receptors which cause whatever reaction (which is usually, indeed, the high that
makes you feel good). The number of those receptors decrease to balance out all the
extra activity they're receiving ... but if it goes too far, and you become
addicted, it becomes an actual physical need (as it was told to me, trying to stop
would be like trying to stop breathing). This is because if you stop taking the
drug, now you have way fewer receptors, but you also have less chemical binding to
them (less than you would have in the first place, obviously), and so it causes a
severe imbalance.
<p>
That's sort of a more in depth explanation of the need to feel good, but I find it
fascinating and clarifying... hopefully you will too. :D

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I usually say that the reason that people drink is because they feel bad, and they want to feel good.
And then they want to feel *really* good.
<p>
Well, going through withdrawal is definitely feeling bad. Been there, done that, I know what it's like.
<p>
And actually, there is even more to it. Not only is the addict going through withdrawal, but he or she is also feeling
his/her ill health and what all of the drugs+alcohol+cigarettes have done to his/her body, and the
cumulative effects of years of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency. (Alcohol is good at leaching vitamins out
of your body.)
<p>
With no drug or anaesthetic to dull the pain, the addict feels it all catching up with him, all
at the same time.
When addicts go through withdrawal, they actually become hyper-sensitive to pain as the
physiological pendulum swings the other way and the body over-compensates for the drug.

That's enough to make the addict panic
and reach for a painkiller, quick.  That is very often the first reason why the addict grabs more of his or her
drug of choice. The having-fun phase comes later.
</font>
<p>
p.s. sorry if there are any confusing typos...

<p>
<font color="blue">
No problem. It seemed clear to me.
<p>
Have a good day, and good luck.

<p>
Why would you write so much about AA if you thought is was a bunch of BS?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Melissa,
<p>
Thanks for the question. And the answer is: Because A.A. constantly promotes itself as the best cure in the world
and somebody has to tell the truth to counter the river of lies and misinformation.
<ol>
<li>
A.A. members routinely plant plugs in movies and TV shows to convince the public that A.A. is the best and only
solution to the problem of alcoholism or drug addiction:
<ul>
<li> <i>The Days of Wine and Roses</i>
<li> <i>28 Days</i>
<li> <i>Clean and Sober</i>
<li> <i>My Name is Bill W.</i> (a Hallmark made-for-TV movie, April 30, 1989, 9 PM, ABC TV)

<li> <i>Cagney and Lacy</i>
<li> <i>ER</i>
<li> <i>The West Wing</i>
<li> <i>Hill Street Blues</i>
</ul>

<p>
<li> More A.A. members write magazine articles that present fake research that tries to fool people into thinking
that A.A. works:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#unscientific_doctors"><i>Doctors in A.A.</a>; the profession's skepticism persists, but MDs
in Alcoholics Anonymous say the 12-step program could benefit all
physicians</i>, by C. Thomas Anderson.
<li> <a href="orange-spirrecov.html"><i>Spirituality: The key to recovery
from alcoholism</i></a>, by Warfield, Robert D.; Goldstein, Marc B.
<li> <a href="orange-pseudo2.html"><i>The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</i></a>, by Jeff Jay.
<li> <a href="orange-big_lie.html"><i>Are we making
the most of Alcoholics Anonymous? (The Last Word)</i></a>, by Peter Armstrong.
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a9.html#Rafalovich"><i>Keep coming back!
Narcotics Anonymous narrative and recovering-addict identity</i></a>, by Adam Rafalovich.
<li> <a href="orange-big_lie.html">More Big Lies &#8212; A.A. Propaganda As Usual</a>
<li> <a href="orange-Galanter.html">More A.A.-Booster Propaganda: the book
<i>Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion</i>, by Marc Galanter</a>
</ul>

<p>
<li> Also, A.A. has lately even been running television commercials, which
is also certainly a violation of
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11">the Eleventh Tradition</a>.

<p>
<li> And then the 12-Step religious cult even has the legal system forcing people to go to their meetings.
The Scientologists and Moonies can only drool in envy.
</ol>

<p>
All of that, while the real major effects of 12-Step treatment are:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">completely failing to increase the sobriety of the alcoholics
while raising the death rate of the alcoholics</a>.

that when I googled Passages Malibu, some of the first sites to pop up call
the Prentisses &quot;the holocaust deniers of the addiction recovery industry.&quot;

<p>
Do you know anything about this potential alternative to AA, etc?

Hello Trish,
<p>
Thanks for the question. I know a little bit &#8212; not a lot &#8212; but a little bit.
I shall have to check out that book.
<p>
First off, you may wish to see another letter that came in a little while ago,
<a href="orange-letters102.html#Passages">here</a>.
That correspondent was not at all impressed with their program.

<p>
Passages of Malibu is the super-expensive, super-luxurious rehab resort
where all of the movie stars go. You know the routine &#8212; 
they make a big deal out of going to rehab, and then 28 days later they come out spouting all kinds of slogans,
and then, a month later, they go get busted for DWI again.
What a circus.
<p>
The Passages web site is:

What next? Sugar Addicts Anonymous? A treatment center for sugar addicts? Sugar =
heroin or cocaine??

This story appeared first on Miller-McCune.com<br>

<p>
Chocoholism may no longer be a joke. A Princeton University psychologist
yesterday presented new evidence that sugar can be physically addictive.<br>
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/pu-scb120908.php
<p>
Bart Hoebel,<br>
http://weblamp.princeton.edu/%7Epsych/psychology/research/hoebel/index.php<br>
whose research focuses on behavior patterns, addiction and the
functioning of the nervous system, has been studying the addictive power
of sugar in *rats *for several years. His previous studies have
demonstrated in the rodents one of commonly understood component of
addiction: a pattern of increased intake followed by signs of withdrawal.
<p>
In his latest studies, Hoebel and his colleagues at the Princeton
Neuroscience Institute have identified another essential part of the
addictive cycle: craving and relapse.
<p>
In his most recent experiments, lab rats were allowed to binge on sugar,
then denied the sweet substance for a prolonged period. When it was
reintroduced into their diet, they ate more sugar than they had before &#8212;
behavior that will sound familiar to many dieters.
<p>
Ominously, the rats increased their consumption of alcohol after their
sugar fix was cut off. They also showed extreme sensitivity to a tiny
dose of amphetamine. Both findings suggest their bingeing changed the
way their brains function &#8212; and not in a good way.
<p>
...
<p>
His previous research has found that rats that binge on sugar provoke a
surge of dopamine<br>
http://www.utexas.edu/research/asrec/dopamine.html<br>
in their brains. After about a month, however, their brains begin to
adapt to the increased dopamine levels by producing fewer of a certain
type of receptor. Thus the animal had to ingest increasing amounts of
sugar to get the same feeling of reward or satisfaction &#8212; a similar
process to that seen in the brains of rats addicted to cocaine and heroin.
<p>
If that sounds alarmist, consider that the rats suffering from sugar
withdrawal exhibited some of the same behavior as junkies in need of a
fix. These include chattering teeth and a tendency to stay in a small
tunnel rather than explore their maze, which Hoedel considers a sign of
anxiety.

Hi Terri,
<p>
Thanks for the note. That's amusing. The author wasn't over-stating the case or exaggerating or anything,
was he, as he equated sugar and heroin?
<p>
(What's really funny is that substituting sugar for heroin is a standard way of ripping off a junkie in a bad
dope deal. And the junkies are not at all happy about the substitution. The junkies really know the difference between the two.)
<p>
Now there is a grain of truth in that story.  Sugar consumption is habit-forming. Just ask the people who absolutely
must get their 3 or 4 Cokes or Pepsis per day, or else they feel out of sorts.
<p>
And what is really disturbing is the fact that the food industry just loads up our food with cheap
high-fructose corn syrup.  It's hard to find any processed food that isn't sweetened with that stuff.
Probably most of the American population is hooked on HFCS.
And that's a big part of why the American people are so obese and diabetic.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I don't know if you ever watch the NBC sitcom &quot;The Office&quot; (it's scary how
much that show reflects my work-life!), but if you missed last night's
episode, be sure to check it out!  I know there's a couple of websites that
allow you to watch it online for free but it might take a week or two for a
new one to show up.

<p>
After getting drunk and setting her hair on fire at the office holiday
party, Meredith is cornered into an intervention by Michael, who after an
utter failure to get the rest of the office to support him, tries to
physically drag her into a rehab center.

<p>
Screamingly funny with what I took away as some strong underlying messages

Hello Dennis,
<p>
I managed to see it. The local NBC affiliate reran it at an odd hour a week later. That was delicious satire.
I hope we see more of that.
<p>
And perhaps the rest of the world can see it on one of the rerun web sites that you mentioned, or catch it on YouTube.

<p>
(Which brings up the question of why
<a href="orange-letters103.html#qwest">NBC-Universal is being so anal</a> about people downloading reruns. Seems like they
need all of the help they can get to have more people watch their shows. They have so few good ones any more...
and not much of an audience share either. Oh dear, am I being catty?)

Subject:  	Other random thoughts<br>

<p>
Still working my way thru your site, which is probably going to take
a while ;-) but just to share some thoughts I've had...

<p>
Bill W.: &quot;Rarely have we seen someone fail who has thoroughly
followed our path.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Rarely have I met someone over four foot one who wasn't at least
four foot two.&quot;

<p>
Steppist slogan: &quot;If you've never worked the steps, you don't know
what they'll do for you.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Well, I've never shot myself in the head with a .44 Magnum,
either, but I know perfectly well what that would 'do for
me'.&quot;<br>
(Actually, now that I think about it, the effect would be
about the same as doing the twelve steps: I wouldn't have a brain
anymore.  &#8212;Ah, and a few days after having originally written that,
I see that you've already said something very similar on your site
yourself.  Great minds think alike.)

<p>
And is it just me, or is there something disturbing and creepy about
the expression, &quot;the rooms&quot;?  It reminds me of what Reese said to
Sarah Connor in the first &quot;Terminator&quot; movie.  &quot;No, I didn't see the
nuclear war.  I was born after.  I grew up in the rooms.  Sick...
starving...&quot;  I wonder whether a twelve-step program would have
helped the people in the future.  &quot;First of all, we admitted that we
were powerless against the Terminators.&quot;  And that's another
interesting analogy: if they had admitted that, they'd have all been
killed. Their only chance to survive came from fighting the
Terminators as hard as they possibly could.

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
When you get a flame from a Stepper, have you ever considered telling
him that he has a &quot;resentment&quot;?  I'd love to see how they'd react to
that...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Parrish,
<p>
I think I did use that resentment line once, a long time ago. I don't think the guy
bothered to answer.
<p>
And the classic response to the repeated Steppers' accusations of resentments was
<a href="orange-letters26.html#resentment">here</a>.
</font>
<p>
<a name="resentment2"> </a>
I wonder what would happen if an &quot;inductee&quot; were to go to his
sponsor, ready to do step five, having prepared a list of all the
things about himself that's good, as well as what's bad.  After all,
step four specifies only a &quot;moral inventory&quot;, not an inventory of
only the bad things.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I keep saying that &#8212; a real moral inventory would have to include the good as well as the bad.
Furthermore, a real MORAL inventory would not be about the stupid jealousies and sexual insecurities that
Bill Wilson listed in
<a href="orange-letters84.html#moral_inventory">his goofy example inventory</a>.
A real MORAL inventory would start with, &quot;How many people have you killed?
How many people have you robbed?
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">How many girls have you raped?</a>
Do you support war? Do you help the poor?&quot; and a lot of things like that.
<p>
When Jesus Christ preached to people about morality, I don't recall him ever mentioning resentments. But
he sure did talk a lot about helping the poor &#8212; which A.A. does not do at all, as a matter of policy.
</font>
<p>
Hope all is going well with you... Best, P

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I am fine, thank you. And I hope you are well too.

<p>
Hello

<p>
I cannot believe how alcoholics anonymous has changed the meanings of words in the
dictionary.  Apparently bill Wilson carries more weight than Noah Webster when it
comes to definition.
<p>
An alcoholic is someone who is addicted to alcohol.  According to AA, an alcoholic
is a person who has a malady of the spirit, whether they are dependant on alcohol or
not.  They must attend meetings, and they are either, a dry drunk, an alcoholic who
has not yet drank, or someone who is still an alcoholic, but did not drink today
because they are in recovery.

<p>
Having beaten addiction may years ago, in spite of having been abused in AA and
told that my human will is the cause of all problems in the world, I quit on my
own.  It just happens that way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello WGC,
<p>
Yes, it just happens that way, sometimes. That's how it happened with me too.

Here is a dialogue that I had on youtube.

Commoncummings, you're a riot! Why don't you just cut and paste the Orange Papers.
You're like a parrott who repeats what they hear without understanding a word of it.
Do you REALLY think Terrance Hodgkins speaks the truth? It's propaganda Cummings,
and you just swallow it without hesitation or investigation. I guess next, you'll
move on to &quot;Powerless&quot;. That's the next chapter in Orange Papers. More propaganda,
and Hodgkins has it completely wrong, but you'll buy right into it anyway, wont'
you.
<p>
fucummings (3 hours ago)<br>
This is hilarious. a man who has given his will and life over to an unseen higher
power, who has attended meetings for thirty years to sober up, who quotes the book
of aa written by bill Wilson as though it were gospel, who belongs to a religious
cult which says &quot;your best thinking got you here, fake it till you make it, your own
stinkin thinkin, is accusing someone else of parroting and not thinking?<br>
did your higher power tell you to do that or was it an order from your sponsor?
<p>
tumescent345 (3 hours ago)<br>
Common sense &#8212; that's funny. I first came to AA in March 1967, and finally stopped
drinking on Sept. 10, 1969 and I've been sober ever since &#8212; thanks to AA. See, I'm
one of the ones who left in the first year.<br>
Cummings, I want to ask you a question. Will you give me an honest answer? I would
like to know &#8212; &quot;are you an alcoholic?&quot;
<p>
fucummings (3 hours ago)<br>
1 you have posted that you have been attending alcoholics anonymous for over thirty
years and are still an alcoholic!<br>
2. the rest of us (haters as you call us) are no longer alcoholics. we are all sober
people, who do not need to denigrate ourselves (I believe you called people
&quot;druggie&quot;<br>
you may call yourself an alcoholic, a drunk, a wino, a bowery bum, all you like.<br>
those of us who have recovered, are not alcoholics anymore. you may continue to
wallow in your self-imposed lifelong sentence.
<p>
tumescent345 (1 hour ago)<br>
I didn't really expect a straightforward answer, but let me put it this way: Before
you were a sober, recovered person, were you an alcoholic? Just tell the truth &#8212; it
won't kill ya.
<p>
fucummings (3 minutes ago)<br>
And you got a straight forward answer!<br>
Sorry bud, you are not my sponsor!<br>
This is not a forum where you keep quizzing and quizzing me, and then try to fit my
answers into your AA mentality.<br>
Time for you to answer:<br>
Are you a drunk, a.k.a. Alcoholic, or wino?<br>
Do you go to meetings regularly and have gone for in excess of thirty years because
you are &quot;one drink away&quot; from a relapse into the gutter?

<p>
Time to open your kimono now<br>
And as you said, &quot;tell the truth, it won't kill you&quot;

<p>
I am toying with the idea of alcoholics anonymous anonymous.<br>
This came up when I was discussing with a friend how we were being browbeat about
the &quot;yets&quot; that would happen if we did not give our lives over to the program.  We
decided that the people who were telling us this were child molesters.  We said that
if that hadn't ever molested a child we could say &quot;not yet!&quot; but that we could tell
that they would one day!

<p>
This is because child molesters who have a history of substance abuse problems, poor
impulse control and addictive personalities. In short, they have a malady of the
spirit, and are not cured of their illness, but are perpetually in recovery.  (BS
weak reasoning, but stronger than what happens in the rooms)

<p>
1. I admitted that I was powerless over my addiction, cannot beat it house of
meetings and therefore I have such poor impulse control that I am a potential child
molester.
<p>
2. Came to believe that I have an irrational belief on an invisible power greater
than myself.  I have come to believe that at times when I had a hard time with this
concept, I have come to believe that a toaster can control my life, and have
considered praying to a toaster, or the wind or other forces of nature.  when that
was hard to stomach,  I believed that a group of drunks who wont take their
medicine, are untrained and uneducated, have no legal confidentiality with me, can
actually work miracles, of the type that are described in the bible.
<p>
3.  A was so insane that a decided to turn my will and my life and my decisions of
my life over to an invisible deity, or my toaster, or the wind.  Other times a let a
group of strangers with serious mental health issues be my &quot;higher power&quot; clearly
someone with this degree of limited intellect and impulse control, in short, with
such a weak will is at high risk for acting on impulses and molesting children.
<p>
4. I engaged in a program of self hate.  I basically beat myself up and read a
stupid book which did so as well.  It told me what a selfish evil person I was, and
did so to brainwash myself so that I could accept the mind control of a cult.  I was
setting myself up to be mentally useless.
<p>
5.  Then I prayed to the invisible man in the sky (or my toaster) and, ready for
this, a trusted all of this to some stranger who I appointed to be in control of my
life decisions.  I allowed him to fuck with my head, and any time I said that I was
right in a conflict; he browbeat me and told me that I was not being &quot;rigorously
honest&quot;
Anyone who is this weak willed has a high potential to molest children when not
supervised.
<p>
6. Decided to sit around and wait for my toaster to make me a perfect person
(believed in miracles)
<p>
7. Actually asked my toaster to do this.  Also, I was so incredibly stupid that I
needed another step to say this.   2 steps to day that I was ready for my toaster to
fix me, and then asked my toaster to fix me.  Again this weak mental state puts
me at risk for molesting children.
<p>
8. Decided to dig up old trash, and think about everything that went wrong in life
and blamed myself for it, and then, embarrassed myself by telling some mentally ill,
controlling person, how everything in my life was my fault.  When I tried to say
that some things were not, he, in spite of having never been there, told me that I
was &quot;not being rigorously honest&quot; and that EVERYTHING was my fault because I was an
alcoholic (even if I was not drinking then or now.  Clearly anyone who is this
stupid and spaghetti willed could not have a meaningful relationship (was told not
to anyway by my sponsor) and is at a higher risk to molest children.
<p>
9. Was ordered by the sick individual (who calls himself my sponsor, even though a
sponsor is someone who pays for things, and he never paid for anything)
<p>
10 was so stupid that after this humiliating and dehumanizing experience, I allowed
myself to be convinced that I had to do this repeatedly and allow a bunch of angry
self proclaimed alcoholics to continuously break down my will.
<p>
11.  Displayed genuine insanity.  I was told to speak with an invisible man in the
sky or my toaster and ask them what to do on every decision that I made.  When I
told the sponsor that my toaster and invisible med did not answer me, he said that
he heard them talking.  He said that he had years of experience and so he could hear
the invisible voices.  I then, did want he told me, the voices were telling me to
do.
<p>
12.  I then tried to proselytize this insane religion, saying that the law is wrong
and that it is spiritual, and not religious, even though I could not see any
meaningful distinction between the two, nor do the courts in the United States.

completed 6 so far, and I felt I was so out of place at these &quot;Meetings&quot;. The
atmosphere was so Cult like I wanted to find out more about this AA, and ASK.com
took me right to your pages. Very well done and thank you for removing the
self-doubt I had begun to feel as they worked their &quot;MAGIC&quot;.
<p>
Again thank you, I feel so much better after reading your take on the 12 steps. I do
believe they are a Cult.
<p>
