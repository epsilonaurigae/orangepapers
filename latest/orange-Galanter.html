<blockquote>
The back cover of the book tells us that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160319194635/http://www.med.nyu.edu/clinician/mg50.html">Marc Galanter is Professor of Psychiatry</a>
and Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at the New York University
School of Medicine.
The author of many books and articles on cults and addiction, he is the editor of
the American Psychiatric Association's official report on cults and new religious
movements.
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
Marc Galanter's book is an odd beast: It is like a chimera made from
merging a good perceptive truthful book about cults with a bad propaganda
book about Alcoholics Anonymous. In his book, Galanter perceptively and accurately
analyzed destructive cults, and had a lot of knowledgeable things to say about them.
He was
right there in the middle of some of those cults, and got permission to
study a few of them first-hand. He studied cults for 20 years, and got
a good feel for their nature. He wrote about the mechanics of cults,
how they work, how they behave, how they stay together, the forces present
in cults, and so on. And he wrote about the evil in cults, and their
destructiveness, and how many of them have harmed and even killed
their members.

<p>
But then Galanter looked at Alcoholics Anonymous, and declared that it was a good
cult. Galanter clearly recognized that A.A. is a cult &#8212; he didn't quibble or
mince words &#8212; he said that A.A. is a cult, and that it uses the same forces
and mind-bending techniques as all of the other nasty cults do.
He rightly included Alcoholics Anonymous in this book about dangerous
destructive cults like the Moonies, Jim Jones' People's Temple,
David Koresh &quot;The Wacko from Waco&quot; and his Branch Davidians,
and the Heaven's Gate cult.
But then Galanter said that A.A. is &quot;a good cult&quot;, because
they use the power of cults for a good cause.
<p>
And upon what evidence did Galanter base his conclusion that A.A. is
a good cult? On one single study by Chad Emrick, who surveyed a bunch
of pro-A.A. propaganda written by other A.A. promoters and then declared
that two-thirds of the A.A. members reduced their drinking, at least
for a while. Then Galanter started talking about the &quot;effectiveness
of A.A.&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<center><i>AA's Success in the Community</i></center>
In a careful review of studies on the outcome of AA participation, Chad Emrick
and his associates concluded that drinking abated in about two-thirds of AA members
during their period of participation; they consumed either less alcohol or none at
all.<font size="-1"><sup>14</sup></font>
Almost half of those who improved remained abstinent for a year.
On the whole, A.A. proved superior to professional treatment in helping
alcoholics maintain total abstinence, although organized professional care
without AA membership was somewhat more effective than AA in helping
alcoholics to reduce their drinking without total abstinence.
AA therefore compares very favorably in outcome with more elaborate and
costly professional management for those who turn to it for aid.<br>

<p>
That sounds pretty good, until you realize just how deceptive that language really is.
The first key phrase in that statement is
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;AA members&quot;</i></font>.
Two thirds of the <i>&quot;A.A. members&quot;</i> reduced their drinking,
Emrick said, not two-thirds of the alcoholics who come to A.A. looking
for help to quit drinking. In truth,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">ninety-five percent of
the alcoholic newcomers to A.A. drop out in the first year</a>, which
only leaves 5% who could possibly become sober long-term <b><i>members</i></b>.
So Emrick was actually bragging that two-thirds of five percent of the
new alcoholics who come to A.A. cut down on their drinking.
That is a mere three and one-third percent (3.33%), which is truly pathetic.
That is massive failure, not &quot;success&quot;.
That is even way below
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">the normal rate of spontaneous remission in
alcoholics</a> &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg">5% per year</a>
&#8212; which is the success rate of alcoholics
who go it alone and get no &quot;help&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot; or
&quot;support group&quot; at all.

<p>
And then the second key phrase in Emrick's statement is
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;they consumed either less alcohol or none at all.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
When you think about it, you will realize that that is a meaningless
statement. Almost anything qualifies as
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;consumed less alcohol&quot;</i></font>.
It doesn't require anybody to actually quit drinking &#8212; they just have to
cut down somewhat for a little while.
A hard-core boozer who merely cuts down and abstains from suicidally-intense binge drinking
for just one month, and then goes back to it and kills himself, qualifies as
someone who reduced his drinking for a while.
Heck, someone who only abstains from drinking for one weekend also qualifies.
<p>
Then Emrick declared that
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Almost half of those who improved remained abstinent for a year.&quot;</i></font>
But &quot;those who improved&quot; were apparently only
3<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup>/<font size="-1">3</font>% of the
newcomers. Half of them is only 1.667%, which is not a success rate to brag about &#8212; it's
a disaster to be ashamed of. It is less than the normal rate of spontaneous remission in
alcoholics.
<p>
So Emrick was really just
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers">lying with qualifiers</a>
and disguising the fact that a tragically low percentage of
newcomers to A.A. actually got sober and stayed dry for one year.
<p>
And one year is only the start of sobriety, not
the climax of a great success story. It is no victory if someone
stays dry for one year and then relapses and dies drunk in the streets.
Heck, it is not much of a victory if
someone stays sober for five years or seven years and then relapses and drinks himself
to death. It's better than never being sober, but it isn't any great victory.

<p>
<center>
<table width="91%" border="5" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

There is another possible take on those numbers: Emrick may have been counting heads
and totalling up the scores (and declaring victory)
sooner than after one year of A.A. involvement, like perhaps
at the six-month point (which would really be premature).
Only 90%, rather than 95% of the newcomers,
would have dropped out by the six-months point. That would leave a few
more people around to be counted as members.
Scoring A.A. then would then yield numbers that stated that
6<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup>/<font size="-1">3</font>% of the newcomers
had temporarily &quot;reduced their drinking&quot;, and that half of them,
3<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup>/<font size="-1">3</font>%
of the newcomers, went on to achieve a year of sobriety.
(And then the other half of the remaining newcomers, the other
3<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup>/<font size="-1">3</font>%,
dropped out of Alcoholics Anonymous.)
<p>
If Emrick scored A.A. that way, then his declared &quot;success rate&quot; is equally
deceptive and meaningless.
In no case did Galanter tell us how Emrick scored the results, or decided
who was counted as a &quot;member&quot;.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Also notice the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#stroking">slanted language and stroking ploys</a>
that Marc Galanter used in that paragraph:
<ol>
<li>
Galanter said that
Chad Emrick did &quot;<i>a careful review of studies</i>&quot;, not that he wrote
a prejudiced essay that was only the collected opinions of a bunch of A.A. proselytizers.

<li>
Likewise, in describing the other cults, Galanter wrote about the curse of
charismatic cults with charismatic leaders, but with A.A., it was
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;The Charismatic Gift of Alcoholics
Anonymous&quot;</i></font>. (Page 212.)

<li>
And Galanter wrote about &quot;<i>AA's Success in the Community</i>&quot;, without having
established that there really was any such success.

</ol>

<p>
Marc Galanter began his proselytizing for A.A. early in his book, right
in the first pages of the first chapter,
by telling a cheerful story of a guy who was drafted into A.A. and quit
drinking after 20 years of alcohol abuse. It was really quite an
impressive story of a guy who apparently found the motivation to quit drinking in
the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After increasingly heavy drinking that began in his teens, Ted became
addicted to alcohol in his mid-thirties. His work performance passed
from adequate to irregular, and he eventually lost the sales job he had
held since college. Within a year, his wife left him, taking their child
with him (he had recently begun to beat her when he was drinking).
Within five years he was hospitalized twice for gastrointestinal bleeding
caused by his drinking. Despite frequent exposure to medical advice and
the exhortation of his extended family, he expressed no interest in sobriety
and had refused to attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. On one occasion,
though, he accompanied a recovering alcoholic friend to an AA meeting and
found himself agreeing to stay after the meeting to speak with some other
members. When I talked with him two years later, he remarked that by
this point no one seemed to care whether he lived or died, but he couldn't
admit that it might be within his power to change this. He could give no
clear reason for agreeing to attend the AA meetings at this point, but
he continued to do so. Within two months of regular meetings, he had
acquired the resolve to remain abstinent, although he himself still
wondered how he had fended off for even sixty days the alcohol that had
controlled his life for over two decades. Later contacts would reveal
that AA helped him maintain abstinence thereafter.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion</i>, Marc Galanter, pages 2-3 in the
2nd edition;
page 4 in the 1st edition.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That sounds great.
But Galanter said nothing about the 19 other people who
went to A.A., and were disgusted and appalled by what they saw, and
walked out without quitting drinking &quot;with the help of A.A.&quot;.

<p>
So where did that &quot;19&quot; number come from? Simple: From the meager
5% retention rate of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Ninety-five percent of the newcomers to A.A. drop out in the first
year, which only leaves 5% who could possibly become sober members. That
means that at most, only 1 in 20 newcomers to A.A. have happy success stories.
So when Galanter tells the story of some guy who got sober while going
to A.A. meetings, we know that there are at least 19 other unmentioned
people in the background whose outcomes were not so happy.

<p>
Really, the numbers are worse than that. There are also many other A.A.
members who go to A.A. meetings for years without managing to stay
continuously sober for very long. They are the yo-yos: up, down, up, down, up, down,
year after year.
They are the reason why we came up with numbers like only 3.33% or 1.67% of the newcomers
staying sober for a year.
And then there are lots more people who just totally
relapse after a few years of sobriety in A.A., and go back out and die drunk
&#8212; like
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_relapse">the <i>Big Book</i>
co-author Henry Parkhurst</a> did after 4 years in A.A.,
and Florence Rankin, author of the <i>Big Book</i> first edition story
<i>&quot;A Feminine Victory&quot;</i> did after a couple of years, and like
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#relapse_list">so many of the A.A.
&quot;first 100&quot; did</a>, and like
<a href="orange-effectiveness#BB_relapses">half of the original first-edition
<i>Big Book</i> authors did</a>. But Marc Galanter didn't talk about any
of those people. Why not?

<p>
That's the problem with
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote">the Proof by Anecdote propaganda technique</a>
&#8212; the propagandist just trumpets the one happy story of success, and ignores the other 19
or 29 or 39 unhappy stories of failure.

<p>
Marc Galanter also failed to establish any cause-and-effect relationship between
going to A.A. meetings and quitting drinking.
Why did that guy &quot;Ted&quot; finally quit drinking?
Maybe for the same reason that he finally agreed to go to some A.A. meetings, after
many years of refusing to go: He was sick and tired of being sick and tired,
and was desirous of a change in his life.
He was finally really ready to make a change, and ready to really quit drinking.
<p>
To put it in
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">the terminology of Dr. Edgar H. Schein</a>,
the alcoholic's personality has become &quot;unfrozen&quot; and is fluid and subject to change.
It is the strong desire to make a change in your life that does the magic, not
joining a cult religion.
<p>
If A.A. really works, why didn't it make those 19 other alcoholics remain in A.A.
and quit drinking?
<p>
And, if A.A. really works, why did A.A. still fail to make even half of the committed A.A.
members stay sober for a year?

<p>
And Emrick's concluding line is ridiculous:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Later contacts would reveal that AA helped him maintain abstinence thereafter.&quot;</font>
</font>
<ul>
<li>
So how the heck did &quot;later contacts reveal&quot; a cause and effect relationship?<br>
<li>
How did later contacts reveal that A.A. helped him to maintain abstinence? Helped him how?
What did A.A. actually do?<br>
<li>
How do we even know whether &quot;Ted&quot; really did maintain abstinence? Did they test him?
Or did Emrick just take his word for it?
</ul>
Emrick's conclusions are just so much B.S.. Again, just because somebody says that he enjoys going to
A.A. meetings does not prove that A.A. is helping him to stay sober.  

<p>
To say that,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;I went to some A.A. meetings and then quit drinking, so A.A. caused me
to quit drinking&quot;</i></font>
is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc">the same bad logic</a>
as the radical fundamentalist preacher who declares,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Mary-Ellen started listening to that Satanic rock-and-roll music and ended up
getting pregnant, so that evil music caused her downfall.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
(Or even worse: Pat Robertson's rap about,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Americans displeased God by allowing
abortions, so God punished America with Hurricane Katrina. So the abortionists
caused Hurricane Katrina to happen.&quot;</i></font>)

<p>
It is the logical fallacy of assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none
exists &#8212;
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc"><i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i></a>
&#8212; <i>&quot;it happened after something..., so it was caused by that something...&quot;</i>.<br>
It is also the logical fallacy of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a> &#8212; just
because two things tend to happen together does not mean that one caused the other.

<p><br>
Immediately after that happy anecdote about a guy named &quot;Ted&quot; quitting drinking, Marc Galanter wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We have come to view alcoholism as a disease, one reflecting both
compulsive behavior and physical incapacity. How can social influence,
through a self-help fellowship, so dramatically change this syndrome?
How can it achieve such impressive results when family, friends, and
professionals have been so limited in their ability to aid alcoholics
alter their behavior, even when their illness seems likely to be fatal?
As we will see, the mutual support by members of Alcoholics Anonymous
serves to engage alcoholics and promote their acceptance of the group's
values. The combination of intense social cohesiveness and strongly held,
shared belief (in abstinence, in this case) allows for such striking
behavioral change.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion</i>, Marc Galanter, page 3 of the 2nd edition;
pages 4-5 of the 1st edition.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
None of that is true.
Galanter was simply
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii">assuming facts not
in evidence</a>, and just parrotting
<a href="orange-aalies.html">the standard A.A. <i>Big Lies</i></a>:
<ol>
<p>
<li> A.A. does not produce
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#prodigious">impressive results</a>&quot; or &quot;striking
behavioral change&quot;. A.A. is a total failure that actually produces some very
negative results &#8212;
A.A. often increases
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">the relapse rate</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">the binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#five_unrelapsed">the death rate</a> in alcoholics.

<p>
<li> A.A. does not work better than &quot;family, friends, and professionals&quot;.
That's just a repetition of Bill Wilson's standard declarations that you can't make it without his cult:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;My own willpower just wouldn't work on alcohol. Change of scene, the
best efforts of family, friends, doctors, and clergymen got no place
with my alcoholism.
I simply couldn't stop drinking, and no human being could seem to do the
job for me.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 63.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then the A.A. <i>Big Book</i> says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here was a book that said that I could do something that all
these doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd
been going to for years couldn't do!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.</font><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li> A.A. does not &quot;so dramatically change this syndrome&quot;.

<p>
<li> 'Alcoholism' is not a disease &#8212; not a real disease like tuberculosis or
cancer. Alcoholism is habitual behavior and it eventually
becomes a physical addiction and sometimes even a mental illness,
and addicted alcoholics are sick, sometimes even fatally ill,
but alcoholism is not a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; that
can be &quot;treated&quot; with cult religion.
<p>
<li> And what Galanter praised as the &quot;mutual support by members of
Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; that &quot;serves to engage alcoholics and
promote their acceptance of the group's values&quot; is really just standard
cultish indoctrination and brain-washing, not something good.
<p>
<li> Unfortunately, the so-called &quot;values&quot; that A.A. inculcates in its victims is a lot
more stuff than just the belief that one should quit drinking &#8212; it's
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma">some really ugly stuff</a> like the belief that
it is okay to lie and deceive newcomers to get them to join A.A. (just like Marc
Galanter seems to be doing to us here).
</ol>


<p><br>
Marc Galanter is heavily in denial about the true nature of Alcoholics Anonymous.
He minimizes and denies at every turn. He talked about Chuck Dederick, the leader of
Synanon, which was a recovery cult that went totally crazy. Galanter explained
that what was wrong with Synanon was that Synanon had a charismatic leader, and
that what is good about A.A. is that A.A. didn't have such a leader. Galanter
simply refused to see that A.A. founder Bill Wilson was a charismatic
leader with delusions of grandeur who
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">stole all of the money</a>, and the
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk">fame and the glory</a>, and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">sexually exploited the pretty women</a>,
and who then lied like a rug about the whole thing.
So that doesn't make Alcoholics Anonymous really so very different from Synanon after all.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
From the outset, Synanon fell victim to the inflated role of Charles Dederich,
its charismatic leader. In contrast to Bill W., Dederich was arrogant and controlling,
and in time even designated Synanon as a religion, granting himself a transcendent
role far beyond that appropriate to the director of a drug treatment program. Unbridled
power leads to feelings of grandiosity that may be difficult to withstand...<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Wow. Galanter described Bill Wilson to a 'T' while describing Charles Dederich,
and then he went into denial about the whole thing:
<ol>
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who fancied himself a new messiah, appointed by
the Lord to save all of the alcoholics.
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who suffered from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">delusions of grandeur</a>
so bad that he imagined that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#denied_recovery">great numbers of
alcoholics would die</a>
if Bill didn't tell them how to quit drinking.

<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who had delusions of grandeur so bad
that he believed that hundreds &#8212; perhaps thousands &#8212; of alcoholics had died
because Bill had refused to allow his face to be printed on
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#TIME">the cover of <i><b>TIME</b></i>
magazine</a>.
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who suffered from delusions of grandeur so bad
that he imagined that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery">he had
discovered a completely new way to quit drinking</a> &#8212;
to become a religious maniac &#8212; and that his new cult (which was just a copy of
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult) was the greatest
medical and spiritual discovery of the century &#8212;
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#greatest_of_all_time">or the greatest of all time</a>.
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who felt
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#concrete_terms">entitled to write iron-clad
spiritual recovery contracts</a>
that the alcoholics couldn't &quot;wiggle out of&quot;.
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who founded a religion that constantly raves about how
God will make you quit drinking.
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who declared that
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#too_good_too_soon">the alcoholics didn't want to
&quot;get too good too soon&quot;</a> &#8212; that those unspiritual alcoholics only wanted to quit drinking,
and weren't holy enough to want to join Bill's authoritarian cult religion, so Bill had to
&quot;make haste slowly&quot;, and feed them the cult religion dogma &quot;by
teaspoons, not buckets&quot;.
<p>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who felt qualified to be
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Poohbah">the Grand Poohbah of
Alcoholics Anonymous</a>&quot; &#8212; the High Priest of Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; and
to lecture everybody else about God, religion, &quot;spirituality&quot;, faith,
belief, and recovery from alcoholism.

<p>
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous is also often very &quot;arrogant and controlling&quot;, especially
when it tells newcomers that they must do whatever their sponsors say, and
that they must make A.A. the most important thing in their lives:

<li> <font color="#8f00bf" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

I've tried to do to the best of my ability.&quot;<br>

&quot;A willingness to do whatever I was told to do simplified the
program for me.&quot;<br>

&quot;I decided <font color="#9F0000">I must

says:<br>

Continuing with that quote from Galanter's book, we get:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unbridled
power leads to feelings of grandiosity that may be difficult to withstand,
so the outcome of this group depended on the establishment of a rational administrative
structure. Unlike AA, however, Synanon did not develop a stable organization or
a democratic community. Instead, power was concentrated in the hands of a single
individual who proved ill fit to manage it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Whereas AA addresses a highly circumscribed aspect of members' lives, alcohol use alone,
Synanon impinged on all aspects of social adaptation.<br>

<p>
Brother. Talk about somebody being in denial. None of that praise of A.A. is true.
None of it. A.A. did not establish a democratic structure. It is a phony fake democracy
where the members can vote all they want, but nothing changes. The leadership in
New York is so unspiritual, dishonest and greedy that they have even
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">committed perjury against other
A.A. members</a> and gotten them sentenced to prison
for the &quot;crime&quot; of printing their own literature
and giving it away to poor alcoholics. (The A.A. leaders were just
protecting their profits, you know.)
The A.A. membership has voted to censure those dishonest leaders, and
the leaders basically told them to get lost and go 'F' themselves.
Nothing changed.
<p>
It is basically impossible for the rank-and-file A.A. membership
to fire or impeach or replace or recall the bad A.A. leaders.
There is no democracy there at all. The leaders do not obey or answer
to the membership.
In addition, the A.A. leaders control the house publication, the
&quot;A.A. Grapevine&quot;, and censor its contents, so you won't read
the truth about what the A.A. leaders are doing in any official A.A.
publications or through any official information channels. (The silence
is deafening.) There is no simple way for the A.A. members to communicate
with the whole membership and organize and build up a reform movement.


<p>
And
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_intrusiveness">A.A. is very intrusive
and impinges in all aspects of the newcomers' lives</a>, just like any other cult,
like by telling the new members not
to take their doctor-prescribed medications, and by telling sponsees
whether they should get married or divorced, and whether they may have
a love affair, and what job to take, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#no_college">not to go back to college and finish
that degree</a>...

<p>
Further down on the same page of Galanter's book, we get:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Dederich later acknowledged in court that his own family had received $2 million
of the organization's funds over a 4-year period.<font size="-1"><sup>33</sup></font>
Such pecuniary gain, of course, stands in sharp contrast to the traditional limitation
on the acquisition of assets with AA, and the disavowal of all personal benefits by the
founder.<br>

page 189 of the 1st edition.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is another standard Alcoholics Anonymous lie. That is so totally untrue that it can't be called a mistake. It is a lie.
Bill Wilson profited from A.A. immensely. He took A.A. for everything that he could get,
including a beautiful house in the country and a Cadillac car.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">Bill Wilson stole the <i>Big Book</i> publishing
fund</a>, and then
Wilson feloniously
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">stole the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i></a>
and then blackmailed the A.A. organization
into giving him an income for life in trade for the copyright that was already legally theirs.
At the time of Lois Wilson's death, she was receiving over $900,000
per year from Bill's allegedly non-existent &quot;personal benefits&quot;.
Undoubtedly, the Wilson family got far more money out of Alcoholics Anonymous than
the Dederich family ever got from Synanon.
<p>
And today, the A.A. headquarters is obviously also very dishonest in how they
&quot;acquire assets&quot;,
as evidenced by their suing A.A. members over the expired <i>Big Book</i>
copyright, and lying and declaring in court that the copyright is not expired or invalid.
<p>
In addition,
Galanter also stubbornly refuses to see that the Alcoholics Anonymous <i>Big Book</i> is as
bad a piece of deceptive and dishonest cult religion propaganda as you will find anywhere.
In fact, he doesn't study it at all. He makes no mention of ever having seen it.
For good reason: if he did study the <i>Big Book</i>, he would have a very hard time
defending it or explaining the contradictions and the delusions and the lies.

<p>
Likewise, Galanter ignores every other negative aspect of Alcoholics Anonymous.
He just keeps repeating the chant, &quot;Other cults bad; A.A. good&quot;, without any real
evidence to support his assumptions and favorite beliefs.
It is sad that this seems to be the state of the art in treating alcoholism in this country.
That rap is, after all, coming from nothing less than
a
