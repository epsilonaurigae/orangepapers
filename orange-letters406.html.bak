Orange, I get that you pick bones with AA for two main reasons (correct me if I'm wrong)
<p>
Reason 1:  AA just doesn't work for the problem it claims to solve . That its solution is not a solution and that it even makes the problem worse or fatal. That the &quot;solution&quot; itself causes a whole other separate problem.
<p>
Reason 2: AA's real existence is to spread its dogma and it is a psychosocial trap. It is a &quot;cult&quot; (I would argue that that word is not applicable in its true sense) I will admit that it is a place where a contagious poisonous social meme exists. I can see with my own eyes that its the only room I know of where 'not knowing what the fuck you're talking' about becomes contagious, that its meant to convert, that its for the most part quack medicine riding atop an accurate description of alcoholism, that it really doesn't offer a viable solution to alcoholism and is straight up steps to conversion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Neal,
<p>
Thanks for the response.  I agree with the two points that you listed,
but there is more:
<p>
<ul>
<li> 3. Alcoholics Anonymous uses the legal justice system
and the health care systems to try to coerce more people into their cult religion.
That is both illegal and unConstitutional.
<p>
<li> 4. Then they lie and claim great success when they have none, to
try to justify such coercion. They run an immense propaganda machine
to promote A.A. and publicize it and plant plugs in every movie and
radio and TV show that they can, while hypocritically declaring that
A.A. is a program of &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot;. &#8212;
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">&quot;Tradition 11.&quot;</a>

<p><li> 5. In that way, they also discourage and suppress other real methods
of recovery.

<p><li> 6.
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">A.A. sponsors routinely
tell sick people not to take their medications</a>,
and causing much suffering and death that way.

<p><li> 7. A.A. is a very abusive organization that permits sexual
predators and con artists to operate within A.A. freely, and A.A. even
protects those criminals through its policy of anonymity.
&#8212; Which is actually a gross misinterpretation of anonymity.
Anonymity does not mean that you don't tell the police when a criminal
is raping an underage girl.

<p><li> 8. A.A. is very harmful, and produces very negative results.
A.A. raises the rates of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">death</a>.  
A.A. also raises
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">the divorce rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">the suicide rate</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. increases the cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.
Old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties is just not a good treatment
for drug and alcohol problems.  It's very bad, harmful, treatment.

<p><li> And there are about two dozen more points. See the file
<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>

</ul>


</font>
<p>
I also admit that people quit on their own, and have spontaneous remission like I did. But the scientific reason for spontaneous remission is unclear and the word 'spontaneous' is about as vague and miraculous sounding as what AA offers, that God did it. Do you see what I'm talking about? Saying it was God or saying you spontaneously had remission is equivalent to saying 'I don't know&quot;. One is just a PC version. I personally quit because of the realization of certain death&lt;----is that good enough to support spontaneous remission? It worked because I was a terrible alcoholic and haven't drank a drop in a year. I dont disagree with the phrase 'spontaneous remission', it exists but is still a fortunate event with unclear causes parallel with 'God healed me!' Both are wonderful because we're sober but the reason; perhaps the wrong side has monopolized the real source.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The word spontaneous is not vague at all. It's very simple:
Whenever anyone gets sick, there are only three possible outcomes:
<ol>
<p><li> They recover their health without any treatment or medicine.
They just get over it.
That is &quot;spontaneous recovery&quot;.

<p><li> They get better with treatment. That is a successful course of treatment. Congratulate the doctor and the medicine.

<p><li> They don't get better. They are either chronically sick for the rest of their lives, or they die.
</ol>

<p>
Now why people spontaneously recover is wide open. It can be any cause.
Sometimes the patient changes his habits and improves his lifestyle,
and starts eating better, and stops bad habits like smoking and drinking and
drugging. That is what happened to me. The cause for that was because
I got sick and tired of being so sick and tired and I decided that I
didn't want to die that way. There was nothing mysterious about that.
<p>
Or the patient recovers because the immune system can easily beat that
disease. Like the common cold. Or simple skin infections that the
immune system wipes out. No doctor is needed. The body routinely
kills diseases and infections, and heals skinned knees,
 without any help from a doctor.
<p>
And then sometimes nobody knows why the immune system suddenly rallied
and eliminated the disease. Sometimes it is mysterious, and the doctor
doesn't know what went right.

</font>
<p>
Those are your points right? More or less? I get it and frankly agree (this is true, I do agree with a lot of your grievances) though there are numerous counter points that you cant just wish away no matter how many people get raped in AA or drink themselves into death because they think they're powerless. But, as above, reasons 1 and 2 are why you've done what you've done---because it doesn't work and that its a cult. Right?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Like I said above, there are more points.
<p>
Counterpoints? What counterpoints?
</font>
<p>
Here is where I don't understand your whole thing. Catholics, Protestants and Mormons (as well as Many other religious bodies) have structures on every street corner in this country as well as influence over every scrap of dirt on this planet. Their influence is without bounds and its been this way for circa 2000 years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, but the only two churches in the USA that are trying to use the legal
system to force people do join their church are the Church of Scientology
and the 12-Step church &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.
<p>
12-Step &quot;rehab centers&quot; and &quot;treatment centers&quot; make billions of dollars
by selling
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's old cult religion</a>
as a quack cure for alcohol abuse and addiction.
Scientology sees the racket that the 12-Step cult is running, and they
want to get some of that money too, so they have been campaigning to have the
courts sentence alcoholics and drug addicts to Scientology
&quot;treatment centers&quot; where people
will be given &quot;toxic rundowns&quot; that are based on the ravings of the
paranoid schizophrenic Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of Scientology.
<p>
So far, none of the Catholics or Baptists or Methodists or Episcopalians
or any other mainstream religion has tried to coerce me into their church,
so there is a big difference there.

</font>
<p>
We know now, without a doubt! that Darwinian Evolution and Natural Selection shaped all life and even morality itself &#8212; FACT. That these mammoth religions are absolutely wrong about the nature of reality. They are not only wrong in their claims but they make whatever problems they purport to alleviate worse, even fatally worse on a regular basis. They are also cults in the most accurate meaning of the word and seek to convert and encompass and rule through memeplexes, group think, dogma---they prey on social and individual weaknesses.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, churches that deny science and tell Creationism fairy tales are wrong.
But most of them do not qualify as cults &#8212; just a bunch of
misguided people with erroneous unrealistic beliefs. 
It's a shades-of-gray thing.
See <a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a> for a
long analysis of what is a cult.

</font>
<p>
My point is that the reasons you give to defend all you work and tirade against AA; they fit immeasurably more with these global faiths. These faiths have killed, enslaved, and fooled trillions of more people and usurped beyond recognition a future of humanity that would be admirable for any outside entity studying us. From an outside, objective standpoint these religions have made us look especially insane, cruel, hopeless, helpless and pathetic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I am quite aware of the slaughter that religions have done. My history
professor told me that the Christian Church burned 14 million girls as
witches in the middle ages.  Grand Inquisitor Torquemada in Spain
marched into one Spanish city of 30,000 inhabitants one day, and
declared that every woman, girl, and baby girl in the city was a witch,
and three days later, there were only 15,000 inhabitants in the city,
all male. Torquemada slaughtered all of the females, even the babies.
The Pope refused to criticize Torquemada or stop him because the Pope
didn't want to weaken the power of the Church. And the current Popes
still have not apologized for that, or admitted any guilt on the part
of the Church.
<p>
And then there were the 20 Years War and the 40 Years War where
Catholics and Protestants murdered each other in countless numbers, 
and thoroughly wrecked Europe.
<p>
But all of that happened several hundred years ago.
What Alcoholics Anonymous is doing is right now.
I cannot change the past, but I can change the present and the future.
<p>
Similarly, right now in foreign countries, the true believers are murdering
without restraint. In just the last week, the bunch of fanatics called
ISIS slaughtered 1500 captured soldiers in Iraq. And over in India
and Pakistan,
the war between the Moslems and Hindus continues. And over in Myanmar,
the Buddhists are killing the Moslems. Buddhists yet. They are supposed
to be pacifists.
<p>
Still, I have no control over those countries or populations, nor do I
have any influence there. But I have some influence here, so I shall
work on what needs changing here.  
</font>
<p>
AA is only the 'idea' of a minnow next to a real, flesh and blood grinding great white shark. AA is like fresh oxygen and 70 degree poolside weather compared to finding oneself on Venus, burning alive in a boiling chemical soup and breathing methane. Why blame AA for its faults when the real murdering, giant lie is destroying the whole of humanity? One is responsible for a finite number of deaths, falsehoods and sexual assaults, the other threatens to extinct an entire species after thousands of years of the most horrendous torture. Who is worthy of our criticism, really?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but I find those analogies to be grossly inaccurate. Given a choice
between A.A. or a mainstream standard-brand religion, I'll take the later
any day. They may have goofy ideas about evolution, but they don't go
around telling people that they are powerless over sin and cannot ever
recover and the only hope is to surrender to God and become a slave of
the Big Dictator in Heaven.
<p>
And they don't tell people not to take their medications.
<p>
And they don't drive people to suicide. Not usually, not like
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">how A.A. does</a>.

</font>
<p>
As far as my AA attendance, I withdrew it (from attending daily for 10 months at a very nice LGBT group welcoming atheists *nothing like the cult you describe*) I only attend it once a week, and only that because I committed to chair a meeting in June which I always introduce a topic that isn't insane (one week I did prescription drugs and outside doctors---no one was saying don't use them and expect AA to miracle your brain into not needing drugs--you exaggerate. Everyone said something to the effect that outside help was vital. The next week I did a meeting about how AA is not allied with any politics etc...&lt;----This is the real reason I stopped attending (including many of your reasons) because the group and especially my former sponsor was so far left wing it was an insult to my history as a former infantry Marine. I was continuously being fed copious amounts of the most bitter liberalism. I like the left just not the out of control kind that the homosexual crowd loves to indulge in.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I don't exaggerate the issue of &quot;no medications&quot;. You are lucky
that you are going to a meeting where the people are not against medications.
I have plenty of horror stories where people were told by their sponsors
and other &quot;elders&quot; not to take their medications.
Look here:
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">A.A. &quot;No Meds&quot; Stories</a>.

<p>
This study found that &quot;only&quot; 17% of the A.A. sponsors were against medications,
and told their sponsees not to take them.

<p>
That means that newcomers have a one-in-six chance of getting a sponsor who might
kill them with bad medical advice. That really is Russian Roulette.
<p>
Note that only one-sixth of the sponsors were telling people not to take their medications,
but one-third of the newer members were counseled not to take their medications.
So apparently each fanatical sponsor was giving bad advice to two or more newcomers.
That makes sense. The crazies try to make as many converts as they can.

<b>The official A.A. web site actually acknowledges that
A.A. members have pushed newcomers into suicide by telling them not to take
their medications.</b>
Their conference-approved pamphlet, &quot;The AA Member &#8212; Medications &amp; Other
Drugs&quot;, on page 13 states
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Because of the difficulties that many alcoholics
have with drugs, some members have taken the
position that no one in A.A. should take any medication.
While this position has undoubtedly prevented
relapses for some, it has meant disaster for others.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
AA members and many of their physicians have described
situations in which depressed patients have been told by AAs to throw away the
pills, only to have the depression return with all of its difficulties, sometimes
resulting in suicide.
We have heard, too, from schizophrenics, manic
depressives, epileptics, and others requiring
medication that well-meaning A.A. friends often
discourage them from taking prescribed medication.
Unfortunately, by following a layman's
advice, the sufferers find that their conditions
can return with all their previous intensity. On
top of that, they feel guilty because they are
convinced that &quot;A.A. is against pills.&quot;

<p>
Of course the above wishy-washy back-and-forth apologetic quote begs the question:
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So which A.A. members, old-timers, or sponsors are
entitled to decide whether
<ol>
<li> the newcomer <i>should not</i> take medications,
in order to &quot;undoubtedly prevent relapse&quot;, or
<li> the newcomer <i>should</i> take medications, in order to prevent sickness or death?
</ol>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So who decides? Who has the knowledge and the power?
Which sponsors or old-timers are entitled to play doctor?






<p>
I'm a Veteran too, and I find it odd that you consider A.A.
to be &quot;liberal&quot;. It is much more like Fascism:
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<p><li>
A liberal will say, &quot;One man, one vote.&quot;

<p><li>
A Fascist says, &quot;The average man is mentally incompetent and is not
qualified to think for himself, never mind vote, so democracy is impossible.
It will never work. The best citizens are those who obey
the orders of their superiors without question.&quot;
<p>
So just do what your sponsor says, and stop your Stinkin' Thinkin'.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
<ul>
<p><li> A liberal will say that you can join any religion you wish, 
or be an atheist if you wish.

<p><li> A Fascist will say that you must join the correct faith, or else:

<p>
I have to strongly disagree with your slurs that &quot;the homosexual crowd loves to indulge in&quot;  
&quot;copious amounts of the most bitter liberalism.&quot;
That is painting with a very broad brush, and stereotyping homosexuals.

<p>
One of my best friends is gay, and he doesn't  &quot;indulge in bitter liberalism&quot;.
He is quite sensible on most subjects. And very intelligent.
His knowledge is vast and encyclopedic, which is one of the reasons that
I like to hang out with him. He also has Asperger's Syndrome, which
makes him a lot like the guy on the TV show, &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;.
He just doesn't even vaguely resemble your stereotype of homosexuals.

</font>
<p>
I have two more meetings in which Im 'supposed' to chair. Through listening to your shit and forming unbiased reasons of my own, I've ceased AA attendance. But I'm still considering attending We Agnostics, a small group comprised of 10 hardcore atheist, recovered alcoholics. We talk about non-AA approved literature the whole time! You seriously exaggerated the negative aspects man and getting to my main point above, you are attacking the wrong organization. What you're doing is accusing the friend of a friend of a bully. Go after the real problem, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. That's where humanity is hit hard. AA is a joke that will die out on its own. All the newcomers go back out anyway and people argue over all of its literature and constantly gossip about each other. In those three religions though, millions swallow the fatal bait, hook, line and sinker.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but I have no intentions of trying to wipe out all of the religions
in the world.
<p>
Have you ever heard the advice to &quot;Choose your battles carefully.&quot;?
I have zero chance of eliminating all religions, so it would be a futile
waste of my time to try. However, I can simply speak the truth and try
to inject some common sense and reasonable rational thinking into the
conversation. That can improve the situation.

</font>
<p>
Its like you're crying over getting splashed with water when whole cities are being sunk by tsunamis. Direct your efforts towards a more guilty institution or are you a fucking theist? I'd be extremely surprised and angry to hear that you were even Pantheist. making the wake you make, you had better be more Atheist than Chris Hitchens.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, the organized religions are not trying to get people sentenced to
their church services (not in the USA), and they are not trying to
push faith healing as a cure for deadly medical problems.  A.A. is a
special kind of evil.  
<p>
Now I know about the appalling religious fanatics in other countries.
We are hearing about the case of a Moslem woman in Sudan who was sentenced to
death for marrying a Christian and &quot;abandoning Islam&quot;.
(Fortunately for her, she was pardoned and is apparently being allowed
to leave the country, although she isn't out yet, as of today.)
And other countries are plagued by religious fundamentalists. This decade,
the Islamic extremists seem to be the most obnoxious. (In other centuries,
it was Christian crusaders and missionaries killing brown- and
black-skinned people by the millions.) On the evening news, we are treated to
a never-ending series of horror stories of what they are doing, like shooting
a 12-year-old girl who goes to school. Alas, I cannot change those
countries or their people. But I can work against having such insanity
happen here.  What I want to avoid is having Ayatollah Anonymous
enforcing a strict fundamentalist dogma here in the USA.

</font>
<p>
Anyway, thanks for reading, it truly is a pleasure arguing with you. Maybe you should think about giving up all attacks on these people (AA and believers) except when they're brought up in your conversational vicinity. I suggest this because you must spend all day on a computer doing this shit and its no way to live, no offense. Go duck hunting, just kidding. AA is not a worthy opponent of your true criticisms. The god damn xtians, jews and muslims are the real culprits.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I don't spend as much time in front of a computer as you think.
And I do go duck hunting, often. And goose hunting, too.
And I shoot them with a camera.
And then feed them. We get along great. And as a result, my suntan is
getting along fine too.
<p>
Lastly, I don't regard the Christians, Jews, and Moslems to be my mortal enemies.
I think that irrational thinking is more of the problem. It's another shades-of-gray
thing. Some believers are actually pretty sensible and some are nuts and
wallow in wishful thinking and imagine that Santa Claus will give them everything
that they want if they are good.
<p>
That gay friend of mine signs his letters with this signature. I'm sure that
you will like it:

<p>
Notice that the writer was a Muslim himself. But he was a sensible one.
He had brains.  I think the same goes for all religious people. Some are very
sensible, thinking people and they are not our mortal enemies.
On the other hand, I worry about the ultra-Conservatives and Tea Party members
and Neo-Nazi nutcases and loud-mouthed religious Fundamentalists.
Many of them are even more irrational and radical and
hateful than any religous true believer.

When I went to Dabbler's Marsh to feed the ducks, this little guy came right to me
before I even started doling out the food.
He recognizes me. He knows that I bring food, so he came to get his share.
He landed on that log in front of me and then hopped towards me. Then he jumped up and down
in anticipation as I doled out the rolled oats and broke up some bread for him.
Then, as soon as I moved away from the pile of food, he jumped on it. And then he called out
to his friends, &quot;Food! Lots of food here! Come and get it!&quot; and two more Savannah Sparrows flew
in, and the three of them had a feast. Then a Redwing Blackbird [or &quot;Tri-Color Blackbird&quot;]
 came too, and joined in.

It turns out that the hummingbirds are very much still around, both the Annas Hummingbirds
and the Rufous Hummingbirds. They have simply been hiding in the new growth. But I've been
seeing them more and more over the last few days. The Rufous male seems to have claimed the
back yard, and the Annas Hummingbird male has taken the front yard, again.

The female Annas Hummingbirds seem to feed in both the back yard and the front yard. And I'm not
sure if it's the same female or if there are more than one.
There are probably several around, because I also see the male hummingbirds driving away intruders.
Some females seem to be accepted, and some not.
Females are often showing up and sneaking a meal from a feeder, and when a male sees that he quickly
drives the intruder away. But they keep coming back.
Those feeders are too good to ignore, even if the males do object and claim that they own the feeders.

I knew that a skunk frequently visited my back yard at night because I could smell it now and then,
 but yesterday my neighbor
discovered that we have a whole family of them: Mother, Father, and four cute babies.
Then this day, I saw two of them, Mama and a baby, beginning to cautiously creep out of the thicket
in broad daylight.
Then they saw me and went back into hiding. But I got these shots of one of the children before
they hid.

Later, my new neighbors discovered that the whole family of skunks was
happily chowing down on the cat food on their front porch. These skunks
are apparently very well adapted to the environment, and quite
comfortable here. And they will be even more comfortable. My neighbor Brandy decided to get some
cheaper catfood for the skunks. She is just in love with the cute baby skunks.
And they are already scarfing up the sunflower seeds and
bread that I put out for the birds, and they are drinking the water out of the pots and pans
that I put out for birdbaths. So they will do just fine.
<p>
Yes, I have some new neighbors downstairs now. Stephanie the college girl graduated as an 
optometrist, and they sent her to Kentucky to do her internship, and Joe and Brandy moved in.
Brandy is in love with all of the Hummingbirds and wildlife. That came as quite a surprise to her.
You rent an apartment, and get a free jungle in back along with it.

<p>
My yard is really turning into a zoo. I think we still have a raccoon in addition to the skunks
and squirrels,
and I haven't identified all of the birds that nest in that jungle in back.
There are a bunch of them.
Speaking of which, the squirrels Fat-tail and Scraggly-Tail also had babies,
so now we have two cute little juvenile squirrels running
around and hungrily eating the sunflower seeds.

The book said that he isn't even supposed to be here. He is supposed to be more up

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I read your 10 + page of negative points which basically are saying that AA is a terrible, fanatical conspiracy agenda full of predators and criminals ready to pounce on the downtrodden.
<p>
Couldn't get through ALL of that negative, but it would be wonderful of you to end your rant with a positive alternative. Then it wouldn't be a rant anymore but a useful article with a useful outcome.

<p>
Where do you, in your wisdom, suggest that depressed people struggling with alcohol addiction go to get low cost help and real support?

<p>
The mailbox is mounted on the front wall of the house, under the porch roof.
This little tree frog wanted to climb up a tree at dawn, so that it could spend the day sleeping
safely in a tree, but it climbed up the front wall of the house instead.
But it found that the top of the mailbox
provided an acceptable sleeping platform.  The lid of the mailbox was canted open, so it made a
shallow V-shaped channel to securely sit in and sleep. No danger of falling out of bed there.

<p>
That is a regular clothespin, so it gives you a good size gauge to see just how tiny this little tree frog
is.

The definition of Psycho-Somatic means that the mind caused the problem in the body. A classic medical example is a stress induced ulcer that really exists. The physical ulcer is caused by the mind.

<p>
&quot;Hysteria,&quot; is when there are no organic (somatic) signs but only subjective symptoms.

IMHO, alcoholism is a symptom and not a disease per say like Wilson claimed. The only way alcoholism can be remotely  defined as a disease is that it causes difficult ease (dis-ease) to the person.

Hi Orange,

<p>
Here's an interesting study from Germany in 2007 that concluded that &quot;The present study was unable to show an advantage of self-help group [AA] attendance in reducing relapses compared to the control group.&quot;

<p>
THE IMPACT OF SELF-HELP GROUP ATTENDANCE ON RELAPSE RATES AFTER ALCOHOL DETOXIFICATION IN A CONTROLLED STUDY.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160408234748/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/2/108.long" target="_blank">
http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/2/108.long</a>

<p>
Participants were taken from the placebo arm of a pharmaceutical trial of the treatment of moderately to severely alcohol dependent individuals. In addition to receiving a placebo pharmaceutical injection the participants were allowed to choose between attending AA or not attending AA. Participants were monitored for 1 year and abstinence was verified by biological tests. Intention to Treat (ITT) evaluation was used where drop outs in both the AA and non AA groups were considered failures.

<p>
Over the course of 1 year 42% of participants in the AA group dropped out and 39% in the non AA group dropped out (possible treatment effect on retention here).
At the end of 1 year the ITT abstinence rate in the AA group was 36.0% and in the non AA group it was 35.7% &#8212; essentially no difference.
<p>
Of those that completed 1 year of participation in the study (Per Protocol evaluation) 62% of the AA group was abstinent and 59% of the non AA group was abstinent &#8212; again, essentially no difference.

<p>
There are some really good aspects to this study:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. There is ITT evaluation data which considers ALL participants &#8212; it includes dropouts.

<p>
<li>
2. There is also Per Protocol (PP) evaluation data which considers only completing participants. Rehabs usually report PP effectiveness and not ITT effectiveness &#8212; there's a huge difference.

<p>
<li>
3. Participants were randomized to the placebo arm of the trial but were free to choose AA or non AA. This study shows that when participants are free to choose there is no evidence that AA is effective (there's already a lot of evidence showing that mandated AA is ineffective).

<p>
<li>
4. All participants were part of a pharmaceutical trial (but receiving placebo) and thus their expectation was that the pharmaceutical was delivering any positive outcome. AA was an optional add on, not the primary approach. This is substantially different to a simple AA vs non AA approach where those in the non AA group might feel that they are receiving no help whatsoever which might generate self fulfilling results.
</ul>

<p>
In summary, 36% of those who began the study remained abstinent for 1 year and ~60% of those who completed 1 year in the study remained abstinent regardless of whether they attended AA or not. Statistically, attendance at AA had no effect.

Hello Iamnotastatistic,
<p>
Thanks for a very interesting study. I am not really surprised
that A.A. was shown to be completely ineffective and useless, of course,
because
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
ALL of the valid clinical tests of A.A. have revealed that
A.A. does not work.</a>
Still, it's good to keep on collecting the evidence
and reporting the truth to the public.  The public will wise up
eventually.
<p>
That study had a very high success rate, like 36% of the alcoholics
 getting a year of sobriety. That is much, much higher than
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">the usual
5% per year rate of normal spontaneous remission</a>.
I suspect that they must have cherry-picked the people who would
become the test subjects, and rejected the sickest ones who would
not recover.  Otherwise, those placebo pills would seem to be pure
magic.
<p>
So far, there is no treatment or medication on earth that immediately
cures 36% of the alcoholics, or alcohol abusers, or alcohol addicts,
or whatever you wish to call them.
And for a placebo pill to do it is outrageous.
<p>
I have a big problem with the author's introduction to the subject:
He says that the results of various tests of A.A. are &quot;inconsistent&quot;,
and he cites A.A. promoters and propagandists as if their tomes were
just as valid as the reports from researchers who
conducted randomized longitudinal controlled studies. The author cites
Emrick and Moos and Moos and Humphries as if they told the truth. But
we know that they didn't. 
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank">The <i>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i></a>
strongly criticized the Moos and Humphreys team for conducting a very
bad test that was basically a fraud.
And the Emrick &quot;study&quot; was nothing but Emrick quoting a bunch
of other A.A. propagandists in order to &quot;prove&quot; that A.A. works.

Have a good day now.

Bees on Hummingbird Feeder
</center>
The honeybees are quick to notice any leak in a hummingbird feeder, and they gleefully help themselves to the sugar-water.
<p>
By the way, this is a very good thing. The honeybees are dying out in many
places because of Varoa Mites, Sudden Colony Collapse Syndrome, and 
insecticides killing them off. But here, we have a wild hive
that is apparently doing well. I don't
know where their hive is, but it's around here somewhere.
We also have lots of little bumblebees pollinating the flowers too,
so this neighborhood isn't lacking in pollinators.
<p>
The loss of the honeybees would be a major ecological disaster.
Most of our food crops &#8212; like over 95% of them &#8212; are pollinated by
bees. If we loose the bees, we lose everything from A to Z: apples and
apricots to Zuchini squash.
The only things that do not require bees are the wind-pollinated grains
like wheat and corn. Oh, and marijuana. So we can be stoned as we starve.
(But pot gives you the munchies, so that would just make matters worse.)

These are the same sunflowers as I feed to the birds.
Some of the sunflower seeds that I spread out for the birds
planted themselves, and this is the result.

Just a quick FYI if you have not seen this.

Long Island Bob O.

<p>

When is an Alcoholic not a &quot;real alcoholic&quot;?

<p>
When they stop drinking by any other means than AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bob,
<p>
Ah yes. Funny how that works. That is exactly what happened to me.
The counselors and A.A. know-it-alls were sure that I was a real
alcoholic before I quit drinking, but after I quit drinking without A.A. or
doing the 12 Steps or &quot;working a strong program&quot;, they suddenly
changed their minds and declared that I wasn't a &quot;real alcoholic&quot;
after all, and I didn't know anything about it.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	Hi please read<br>

<p>
I don't know who will read this, or who wrote this. I just wanted to say thank you. I too went to AA for 6 months going through difficult times. I allowed an alcoholic to tell me I had a problem and needed to go to AA.
When what I needed was a therapist and anxiety medication. It destroyed me emotionally and mentally. Altered my sense of reality and my faith in humanity.

<p>
Never have I met such a crowd of hypocritical lying egotistical people stuck in their delusional pink cloud of narcissism in my life. I rarely drink now. My life although not perfect is not the complete chaos it was since I got away from AA.

<p>
I suffered much there and was an outcast all because I refused to become an drone and drink the AA kool aid.

<p>
The 12 steps don't work for everyone and as they say, &quot;we are not doctors,&quot;. I was accused of not surrendering and not working the steps and that's why I was not happy in my sobriety.

<p>
Well with all due respect AA can kiss my ass. Once again thank you gor this article. I hope more people read this and get the proper help they need and stay away from the cult that is AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ronnie,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for the thanks,
and I couldn't agree more.
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and are free of the
madness.
<p>
Many people will read your letter. I don't have any statistics handy
now, but the last time I was getting numbers, the web site was getting
5 or 6 million hits a month, so certainly at least a few thousand people
will read your letter, maybe a lot more than that.
<p>
And I also hope that people get the help that they really need,
rather than quackery and superstition, and abuse from cult members.

<p>
Have a good day now.

**     This is the key to understanding the value of AA:
**     don't listen to what the members say;
**     watch what they actually do.
**     We as a society are much too gullible,
**     especially when we see a group of people who seem
