Bill Wilson wrote that his second book,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
was a manual for how to live happily by using
the Twelve Steps, and that his many years of <i>working the program</i>
had not produced any ill effects:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A.'s Twelve Steps are a group of principles, spiritual in their nature,
which, if practiced as a way of life, can expel the obsession to drink and
enable the sufferer to become happily and usefully whole.<br>
...<br>
Many people, nonalcoholics, report that as a result of the practice of A.A.'s Twelve
Steps, they have been able to meet other difficulties of life. They think that
the Twelve Steps can mean more than sobriety for problem drinkers.
They see in them a way to happy and effective living for many, alcoholic
or not.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 15-16.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Note that Bill Wilson was pushing his Twelve Steps as a way of life
for everyone, alcoholic and non-alcoholic alike, and Bill claimed
that the Twelve Steps would solve many more problems in life than
just alcoholism. That is because Twelve Steps are not really about
alcoholism at all. The Twelve Steps are
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">a formula for converting people into
true believers in Bill Wilson's cult religion</a> &#8212; for converting them to
&quot;our way of life&quot;. That's why the Steps were supposedly just as
good for non-alcoholics as for alcoholics.

<p>
In Bill Wilson's case, that was a shameless barefaced lie.
What Bill didn't bother to tell his readers was that he was actually
so unhappy, so mentally ill and so depressed, that he was completely
disabled and non-functional, and under the care of two psychiatrists &#8212;
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a> and

years.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

that all he could do was lay in bed and stare
at the ceiling all day long, or just sit in his office and hold his
head in his hands all day long.
But Bill Wilson didn't tell prospective new members about that,
while he was urging everybody to <i>Work The Steps</i>,
and claiming that he had a magical never-fails formula for &quot;happy and
effective living&quot;...

<i>Progressive Indoctrination and Progressive Commitments</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
The A.A. program is loaded with deceptive progressive commitments and
bait-and-switch tricks. Even the &quot;One Day At A Time&quot; and &quot;Just For Today&quot;
slogans are used to make people do things for many years, even for the rest of their lives,
just one day at a time.
<p>
First, they tell you that &quot;You must admit you have a problem&quot;, but then that
 gets changed into &quot;You must admit that you are powerless and you have
a disease from which you can never recover.&quot;
There is a huge difference between agreeing that you have a problem, and believing
that you have an incurable fatal disease over which you have no control.

<p>
The Alcoholics Anonymous program is advertised as an easy-going voluntary
program where you don't have to believe much or do anything in particular:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.
All of its Twelve Steps are but suggestions.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 26.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

But then you are supposed to start sharing in Bill Wilson's religious beliefs:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As soon as a man can say that he does believe, or is willing
to believe, we emphatically assure him that he is on his way.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
<i>We Agnostics</i>, Page 47.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said,
<i>&quot;Why don't you choose your own conception of God?&quot;</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That statement hit me hard. It melted the icy intellectual
mountain in whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years.
I stood in the sunlight at last.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>It was only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power
greater than myself. Nothing more was required of me to make my
beginning.</i><br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 1, <i>&quot;Bill's Story&quot;</i>, Page 12.</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
Soon, we learn that such vague religious beliefs are not nearly good enough. We
must believe much more.
Bill Wilson devoted
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">all of chapter four</a>
of the <i>Big Book</i> to lecturing us about how we must all
&quot;have faith&quot; (in his religion).
There, Bill Wilson actually declared that we must
abandon intelligence and <b><i>&quot;Reason&quot;</i></b>
and just have faith in his teachings.
Bill felt that being intelligent and having a working brain was a
serious impediment to success in his program.
But in
<a href="orange-recruit.html">the recruiting manual</a>
(chapter 7 of the <i>Big Book</i>),
Bill Wilson taught recruiters to tone down the message, so as to not
scare away the newcomers.

<p>
Bill Wilson knew that his religious beliefs were extreme, and that newcomers would leave
if they were told the whole truth, so Bill taught a policy of hiding the truth from newcomers
and only revealing the true nature of the Alcoholics Anonymous program a little bit at a time
&#8212; his &quot;teaspoons, not buckets&quot; doctrine:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#9F0000">
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else.</font> They clung to their other defects, letting go only
little by little. They simply did not want to get &quot;too good
too soon.&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes">
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts</a> &#8212; absolute
purity, absolute honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212;
were frequently too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed
with teaspoons rather than by buckets.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 74-75.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;just finding sobriety&quot;</i></font>
is what Alcoholics Anonymous was supposed to be about &#8212; it's what they
advertise to the public. They don't tell prospective new members that
A.A. is really a strange religion that will allegedly lead you to
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#one_true_God">the One True God of
Alcoholics Anonymous</a>,
and teach you to practice
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes">Frank Buchman's <i>Four Absolutes</i></a>.

<p><br>
Likewise, as far as doing the Twelve Steps goes,
the tone gradually changes. They start off with the tolerant declaration
that you don't have to do anything &#8212; it's all just easy-going
<i>&quot;suggestions&quot;</i>
&#8212; but then we start to hear that we <i>must</i> follow
Bill Wilson's instructions, or else. Again, you start with:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.
All of its Twelve Steps are but suggestions.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 26.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 59.</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>

But then the steps are accompanied by increasing demands for total commitment to
Bill's program &#8212; you must be willing to &quot;go to any length&quot;
and &quot;let go absolutely&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any length
to get it &#8212; then you are ready to take certain steps. &nbsp; ...<br>
Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the results were
nil until we let go absolutely.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 58.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And then in the next chapter, at the Fifth Step, Bill Wilson suddenly declared
that the &quot;suggested&quot; Steps were now &quot;vital steps&quot;, and he
threw in little fear-mongering to scare people into compliance:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, page 72.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And another A.A. member tells us that we must &quot;have faith&quot; in the A.A. program:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I was beginning to see that I would require implicit faith, like
a small child, if I was going to get anywhere.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, <i>The News Hawk</i>, Page 259.</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And then, finally, we get the death threats &#8212; we must do what Bill Wilson
says or else we will die:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And a commonplace A.A. slogan is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;If you don't work the program, then your fate will invariably be 'Jails,
Institutions, or Death'.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is quite a progression, from &quot;you don't have to believe anything&quot;, and &quot;the steps are just
suggestions&quot;, to &quot;you must have implicit faith&quot;, and &quot;Work the Steps or Die!&quot;
<p>
A book called the <i>&quot;Serenity Bible&quot;</i>, which was written by
a couple of hard-core Steppers who ran a rehab center in Texas,
describes the A.A. progressive commitments precisely,
gradually progressing from &quot;you may have any beliefs&quot;,
to &quot;you will know the one true God of A.A.&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We may start out as agnostics. We may then come to view the group
or recovery process as our higher power, looking to other
people for strength. Gradually, we accept a vague notion of god,
which grows to a more specific monotheistic god.
We may even begin to pray to and dialogue with this god.
Eventually we come to know the one true God.<br>

<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_magical">73</a>.
<i>Magical, Mystical, Unexplainable Workings</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10 and deserves more.<br>
<p>
A.A. members claim that the Twelve-Step program works in some magical, mystical,
&quot;spiritual&quot; way that cannot be explained logically or rationally.
If you ask an old-timer,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Well, how does this program work, exactly?&quot;</font>,
the old-timer will often just grin and say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Just keep coming back, and eventually you will get the idea.&quot;</font>

<p>
The Twelve Steps do not actually tell anyone to quit drinking, or to help anyone
else to quit drinking. The Steps are all about
<ul>
<li>
admitting that you are powerless and insane, and your life is &quot;unmanageable&quot;,
<li>
and then surrendering your will to something or somebody else,
<li>
and then listing and confessing all of your sins,
<li>
and then begging God or some other &quot;Higher Power&quot; to remove
your &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character&quot;,
<li>
and then begging God to tell you what to do in a s&eacute;ance,
<li>
and then recruiting more members for the cult.
</ul>
Obviously,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">those old cult religion practices from the Oxford Group</a>
have nothing to do with drinking alcohol, and they never did.
Nevertheless, that routine is supposed to somehow magically make
people abstain from drinking alcohol. It is even supposed to take away the desire
to drink alcohol. In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson opined,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it. &nbsp; ...<br>
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Some A.A. apologists and promoters repeat the old Oxford Group religious dogma
that excessive alcohol drinking is caused by <i>unconfessed sins</i> and <i>unrevealed secrets</i>,
and that confessing all of one's sins in Step Five will remove the desire to drink alcohol, which is a
crazy claim that is not backed up by a shred of medical or psychological or scientific evidence:

because they feel bad and want to feel good,
and they use alcohol and drugs to try to feel good most all of the time,
not because they have a secret.
This is blatant pseudo-science and quack medicine.
Where does the authoress get this garbage? (Besides from Bill Wilson's cult religion...)
Has there ever been even one valid psychological study that showed that people drink alcohol
to excess and become alcoholics or drug addicts because they have unrevealed
secrets or unconfessed sins? I don't think so.

To get the full benefit of AA, Dr. Ken notes, he had to stop analyzing
his experiences, as he had been trained to do in medical school:
&quot;Once I stopped thinking and got in touch with my feelings, it was
an overwhelming transformation....
I found what I had always been
looking for &#8212; to love myself and be loved by other people.&quot;<br>

Certainly, however, the spiritual dimension that is so strong in AA
is at odds with the scientific, medical tradition. Says Dr. Ken:

The author claimed that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Certainly, however, the spiritual dimension that is so strong in AA

That is blatant cult propaganda. The &quot;medical tradition&quot; is not
against &quot;spirituality&quot;, it is against quackery and superstition and
things that don't work to cure the patients.

<p>
When it says:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Dr. Whitfield agrees that AA's effectiveness can't be explained
in scientific terms, or tested in controlled studies.&quot;<br>
</font>
what that really means is,<br>
<font color="blue">
<b>&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">A.A. doesn't work. It isn't effective at all.</a>
That's why it fails every real test.&quot;</b><br>
</font>
Dr. Whitfield is merely trying to claim that A.A. works in some magical,
mystical, unexplainable manner that cannot be measured.
Such deceit is the last refuge of a quack doctor who is pushing ineffective cures.
Of course success can be measured, easily &#8212; either the alcoholics quit drinking, or they don't.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">Just count heads</a>.
It is very simple. Just count heads after a few years, and see how many got sober, and how many didn't.
Then you will know what A.A.'s effectiveness is.
And when you do that, you will see that A.A. does not work.

<p>
A.A. promoters constantly repeat the chant that A.A. cannot be
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">studied scientifically</a>,
because every careful objective study of A.A.
&#8212; every randomized longitudinal controlled study &#8212;
that has ever been done showed that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">A.A. doesn't work</a>,
it doesn't save the alcoholics' lives,
it doesn't increase sobriety,
and it is just another crazy irrational
<a href="orange-spirrel.html">cult religion</a> that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">increases the death rate in
alcoholics</a>.
<p>
Dr. Ken allegedly stated,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Spirituality is a gut or heart-felt experience that certainly can't
be scientifically studied...&quot;</font><br>
That is nonsense. Spirituality is not emotionalism;
it is not getting gut feelings; it is not getting a giddy
warm rush by marching around singing &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#protofascists">like the Oxford Groups did</a>.<br>

Furthermore, emotional states &#8212;
even &quot;gut or heart-felt experiences&quot; &#8212; certainly
can be studied scientifically. Psychologists do it every day.
<p>
Besides which,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives">that is another bait-and-switch trick</a>.
Dr. Whitfield is changing the subject.
The goal of the Alcoholics Anonymous program
was supposed to be to save alcoholics from death by alcohol addiction, not to induce
warm and fuzzy feelings that cannot be studied.
But since A.A. is a total failure as a treatment for alcohol abuse,
Dr. Whitfield switched to talking about emotional states &#8212; &quot;spirituality&quot;
and &quot;gut- or heart-felt experiences&quot;. That is deceptive and dishonest.

<p>
Lastly, Dr. Earle argued that doctors can benefit
from A.A. if they stop thinking, and stop wanting to know the reason (causes)
for everything &#8212;
<i>When you stop thinking, you can really feel happy in the cult:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;Once you don't have to know the reason for everything, you're
coming home, baby, you're really coming home.&quot;</b></font></i>
<p>
Such blatant anti-intellectualism is beneath contempt.
Nobody in his right mind would want to be treated by such a cultish non-thinking
doctor who is pushing voodoo medicine as a magical, unexplainable, treatment for the
deadly, often-fatal, condition called alcoholism.

As an AA member from 1981 to 1988, I sometimes felt myself saying things

I would prepare to make a point in which I did believe and found myself
saying something like, &quot;Well, you know, before I got into the program
all I did was drink.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Somewhere within, I'd hear the sound of screeching brakes: &quot;What?!&quot;
It was a ridiculous statement. I had worked full-time (never missed a day
because of drinking), acted in dozens of theatrical productions, written
articles and short stories, dated, took vacations, read books, played
basketball &#8212; all during the time I was supposedly laid up drunk.

<p>
A.A. members do not directly vie with one another for the guru's attention,
or for status within the group. While everyone <i>is</i> trying to become
part of the inner circle of respected and venerated old-timers, that is
accomplished more by maintaining sobriety for years, going to a zillion meetings,
parroting the
standard party line at meetings, and sponsoring newcomers, rather than
by directly competing with other members.
And, as in so many other cults, relatively new recruits earn their
spurs by criticizing outsiders and defending A.A. from critics, rather
than by attacking fellow members.

The committed members are real <i>true believers</i>, as described by Eric Hoffer
in his book
<i><a href="orange-bibliography.html#true_believer">The True Believer</a></i>.<br>
<p>
It doesn't matter how carefully and patiently you point out
the inconsistencies and contradictions in the cult's theology,
it doesn't matter how clearly you show that something is ridiculous
nonsense,
the true believers will just smile and say &quot;Yes, but...&quot;
and then proceed to explain how a doctrine that is clearly illogical,
and perhaps even impossible, is really correct &#8212; even inspired
cosmic wisdom.
<p>
The true believers aren't about to allow their opinions to be swayed by mere facts:
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The truth of the matter is I know it works b/c it works.
You may not believe that, but

<p>
And there is no shortage of true believers who are ready to lash out
angrily and hatefully whenever anyone dares to criticize A.A. or
its beliefs. Many people are not interested in the truth at all.
They say that they are, but they are not.
Rather, they just want to hear some affirmation of their own beliefs &#8212; that is,
their own superstitions.
They incant the line from page 58 of the <i>Big Book</i> about Alcoholics
Anonymous being a lifestyle of rigorous honesty, and then they stubbornly
refuse to hear the truth.
<p>
I regularly receive emails from true-believer A.A. members who
claim that I am wrong about something or other.
When I answer, showing them the evidence that supports my statements,
they simply ignore it and change the subject,
and complain about something else.
<a href="orange-letters4.html#mere_facts">They simply will not allow

A.A. doesn't generally use scapegoats &#8212; they just individually blame every person

A.A. doesn't tend to excommunicate people &#8212; rather, it wants them to <i>Keep Coming

<p>
However, criticism of the A.A. program is grounds for instant ostracism. Telling the truth
about the real history of A.A. and its founders is grounds for excommunication.
<p>
And A.A. has an unfortunate tendency to tell members to dump their non-A.A. spouses and
marry within A.A., so that all A.A. members will have &quot;someone who understands&quot;, rather
than a spouse who might &quot;trigger them&quot; and &quot;cause a relapse&quot;.

only feels &quot;Serenity and Gratitude&quot;.
<p>

Bill Wilson actually promised us that God would just magically remove
our cravings for alcohol, with no effort on our part
(if we did Bill's Twelve Steps correctly, which is a lot of effort):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Bill Wilson also promised that newcomers to A.A. would get other benefits,
like becoming sane psychics from doing Step Eleven:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this
for a while.
What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration becomes a working
part of the mind.
Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact
with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired
at all times.
<font color="#9F0000">We might pay for this presumption in all sorts

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we
will be amazed before we are halfway through. We are going to
know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the
past nor wish to shut the door on it. We will comprehend the
word serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far down
the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can
benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will
disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain
interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole
attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and
of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know
how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly

&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears">without
any thought or effort on our part</a>&quot;,
like Bill Wilson said.
You still have to quit the hard way, just like everybody else.
</ul>

<p>
That was all just Bill Wilson's crazy delusional ravings, not a shred of truth in it.
You never get the promised goodies. What more can I say?
