From:  	&quot;amy S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Bill wilson.<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
Saw your blog/rant about Bill wilson. I have a few questions for you. And
some observations.

<p>
1. Bill Wilson is dead. He was just a guy. Why butcher a dead guy? What is
the point of that? So what if he was crazy? What if I did a paper on your
dead friend, parent, or significant other after they died and published it
on the internet? That sounds pathetic... a waste of time, doesn't it?

<p>
2. So, he was screwed up. Show me one alcoholic who is not a liar, cheat,
or thief. Just one. In fact, show me one AA member who won't admit to being
a liar, cheat, or thief. That's a bigger task for ya.

<p>

<a name="millions"> </a>

3. Isn't it odd how his program has helped millions get sober and stay
sober long after he was gone? Maybe it works for some. Maybe it doesn't for
others. Would you rather alcoholics not try to get sober? And, if AA
weren't around, how could they get sober and stay sober anonymously? Do you
think that a true alcoholic can just stop on their own willpower or is
medical research just wrong?

<p>
4. He stole some ideas, concepts, ghost wrote stuff, etc. Not a secret. Are
you trying to give us some kind of revelation here?

<p>
<a name="bad_dog"> </a>
5. I am a member of AA. I don't worship wilson or smith. I don't believe
any aa member does, but can you tell me how anything you wrote matters? So
he did what he did, and it continues to benefit millions around the globe.
If alcoholics are sitting in rooms drinking coffe and chewing or smoking
tobacco instead of running rampid in the community, what do you care? I am
not driving around intoxicated gunning for pedestrians. But, I chew
tobacco. That is a crime? I am sober, so what's the issue? That is my
personal choice, just as staying or leaving AA is my personal choice. As
one aa member stated &quot;you have to feed the good dog, and the bad dog&quot;
Chewing is feeding my addict. Or, would you rather I just get loaded and
use my car?

<p>
6. People in cults have a hard time leaving... given threats, cohersion,
etc. I can walk out any time, and any AA member would freely let me go.

<p>
7. God. If you haven't figured it out, its about a God that you understand
(which is different for everyone). By that standard, you couldn't qualify
AA as a religion.

<p>

<a name="millions2"> </a>

<a name="laugh"> </a>
8. If you ever knew anything about alcoholism, you would know its not about
drinking. Alcoholism happens when you stop drinking. This was the point
Bill was trying to make. We are the bottom of the barrell. We have to live
peacefully somehow, because we can't do it loaded, and we can't do it alone
without alcohol. So the steps are in place to teach us how to live as best
we can, despite our fucked~up~ed~ness. So, if the program helps millions
stop themselves from suicide, homicide, pedricide (pedestrians, of
course)... why on earth are you upset? We aren't hurting you, your family,
your friends. Bill acknowledged he wasn't a saint. Why are you pointing
that out after he did? (I am laughing as I write this)

<p>
And why, for god's sake, do you even invest time trying to tear apart a
dead guy? Reading your thing here is like reading an athiest's paper.
Nobody cares and the opinion doesn't affect the lives of... well, anyone.

<p>
And for the record, I always offer to buy newcomers drinks. I am not
anti~alcohol. I do not care what someone does as long as it doesn't hurt
anyone else, or themselves. They can't come back dead, but they can come to
the rooms drunk. Does that sound cultish to you? Shit, they can have as
much coffee or sugar or tobacco as they want. Doesn't matter to me.

<p>
You are telling the truth to a degree. I shrug. It keeps me sober, so what
do I care how or why he did what he did? And if I am a member, and I don't
care, why the hell do you care?

<p>
Just sayin.

<p>

Thanks for the letter. Now I'll go through your questions one by one:

That is the standard propaganda trick of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Minimization and Denial</i></a>.
Sick people deserve better treatment than the lies and cult religion and quackery of such a criminal.
<p>
By the way, I notice how you stereotype alcoholics as bad people: &quot;liar, cheat,

<font color="green">&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has no respect for alcoholics.&quot;</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, &quot;his program&quot; has not &quot;helped millions get sober and stay sober&quot;. That is the standard A.A.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">Big Lie</a>. It's
some completely untrue grandiose bragging that is a total reversal of reality.
A.A. has a horrendous failure rate, coupled with an appalling death rate. The A.A. Trustee Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant
said that.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Your nonsense about how alcoholics cannot figure out how to quit drinking is just Bill Wilson's lies,
declaring that alcoholics must join Bill's cult or else they will die.
Alcoholics figure out how to quit drinking, every day:
<p>
<center>
<h2><i>Just don't take that first drink, not ever, no matter what.</i></h2>
</center>
<p>
It's very simple, and very easy to figure out. I figured it out, and you think I'm either stupid or insane,
so other alcoholics can figure it out too.
<p>
Again, you are stereotyping alcoholics as mentally-retarded losers who just can't figure out how
to quit drinking unless they join a cult religion and do its crazy occult practices.
What disgusting condescending madness. A.A. just has no respect for alcoholics.
Read
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy</a>
for much more of Bill Wilson's contempt for alcoholics.

<p>
The vast majority of alcoholics who quit drinking do it all on their own.
The National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health said that 75% of the successful quitters do
it alone, on their own.

The Harvard Medical School reported that 80% of the successful quitters
 do it alone, without any treatment or A.A.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
Your statement,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Do you think that a true alcoholic can just stop on their own willpower or is
medical research just wrong?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
... is a complete reversal of reality.
What &quot;medical research&quot; really says is that A.A. does not work at all:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma found that A.A. increased binge drinking</a>.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found that A.A. increased the rate of rearrests of alcoholics</a>.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Walsh found that A.A. increased the cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.

<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="newwin25">In Great Britain, Doctors Orford and Edwards found</a>
that a whole year of A.A.-based treatment was no more effective than just
having a doctor talk to the alcoholic and his wife one time for one hour,
telling him to quit drinking or he would die.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant, who went on to become a member
of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., found that A.A.
was a total failure, yielding a zero-percent improvement in recovery, and even worse, A.A.
increased the death rate of alcoholics</a>.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced as high a death rate.
</ul>

<p>
And again, you are trying to use
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;
to assert &#8212; with no evidence &#8212; that &quot;medical research&quot;
supports A.A., which it does not.

<p>
And the result of the A.A. &quot;program&quot; is not that alcoholics sit in rooms drinking coffee and chewing gum. The real result
is that they relapse and binge drink and commit suicide.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Again, you are making the fraudulent &quot;millions helped&quot; claim. There is no truth to that.
There are no millions saved.
<a href="orange-letters317.html#millions" target="_blank">Look here for a thorough examination of
the &quot;millions&quot; claim</a>.

<p>
By the way, why don't the 12 Steps work to make you quit your tobacco addiction?
Aren't they &quot;spiritual&quot; enough to be able to handle a tobacco addiction?

<p>
And your excuse that you have to
&quot;feed the bad dog&quot;, or &quot;feed the addict&quot;, is a good example of Lizard Brain thinking.
It's totally untrue, of course, and it's just a lame-brained excuse for continuing an addiction.
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson pulled the same stunt too</a>,
to avoid quitting smoking, you know.
That's really another great example of the bad misinformation that Alcoholics Anonymous spreads around,
which harms people who are trying to quit all addictions and get healthy.
Read about the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster here</a>.
<p>
Curiously, the dogmatic A.A. members claim that you aren't really sober if you are taking
medications &#8212; not even legitimate medications that the doctor prescribed.
<i>&quot;Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;</i>, right?
So I guess you aren't really sober when you are self-medicating and calming your nerves with nicotine, right?
You aren't really dealing with your issues, are you?
You have just substituted one drug for another, right?
<p>
And what a drug. Tobacco is the deadliest drug in the world. In the USA, drugs like heroin and cocaine
and speed kill about 5,000 or 10,000 people per year, each; alcohol kills 113,000,
including fatal drunk driving accidents, and tobacco kills 430,000 people per year.
And here you are, making excuses and bragging about your tobacco addiction, and rationalizing that
it's okay. If tobacco is okay, and even permissible in a &quot;spiritual&quot; life, why isn't alcohol also okay?
Why make a big fuss about the number two killer drug when the number one killer drug is okay?
<p>
Coincidentally, tonight, 20 August 2012, the PBS Newshour reported that a new study of smoking worldwide
reports that tobacco addiction is a real disaster. At current rates of addiction, the worldwide death
toll from tobacco will be 8 million per year by 2030.
And you think tobacco addiction is okay? Just &quot;feeding the bad dog&quot;? You should rethink your value system.
<p>
And again I have to ask, if &quot;feeding your bad dog&quot; is okay, why isn't
it okay to also give your bad dog a drink? Isn't the poor little bad dog thirsty?
And why not give your bad dog a shot of heroin and a snort of cocaine, while you are at it?
<p>
Again, go read
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>,
and you will learn all about the brain behind the &quot;bad dog&quot;.
Indulging the &quot;bad dog&quot; is a suicidally stupid thing to do.

<p>
The A.A. member who told you, &quot;You have to feed the good dog, and the bad dog,&quot; is a prime example of what
is wrong with A.A. &#8212; know-it-all fools giving out bad advice while posturing as wise counselors.
They kill a lot of people with their insane nonsense.
<p>
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">My 12-Step cocaine-snorting child-raping Internet child pornographer &quot;counselor&quot;</a>
also told me not to quit smoking cigarettes in addition to quitting drinking by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you put too much on your plate, something might spill off.&quot;
</font><br>
Fortunately, I had to good sense to ignore his bad advice. I now have 11, almost 12,
years off of both alcohol and tobacco, while
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Christina" target="_blank">he has a long prison record and is a registered sex offender</a>.
I sure am glad that I didn't listen to him. Good health is such a joy.
It's so good to be able to ride my bicycle, even uphill, without getting all out of breath
and huffing and puffing and feeling like I'm going to die.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. Again, that is more
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Minimization and Denial</i></a>.
Leaving is not easy. You never wised up and left, did you?
<p>
Tell me how easy it was after you wake up and learn the truth and quit A.A. and deprogram from the cult.
Tell me then how easy it is.
<p>
And if you tell me that you can quit the cult any time you want, but you just don't want to, I'll point out
that alcoholics and cigarette smokers use the very same excuse for not quitting their addictions.

<p>
There are plenty of threats in A.A. &#8212; threats of death, threats of relapse, threats of insanity,
warnings that people will turn into
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">Dry Drunks</a>&quot;
&#8212; if they quit Alcoholics Anonymous. A.A. has lots of slogans like:
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;You must <i>Work A Strong Program</i>, or else your fate will be <i>Jails, Institutions, or Death</i>.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you drink, your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you leave A.A., your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;
<li> &quot;I've been in jails; I've been in institutions; there's only one more place to go.&quot;
<li> &quot;The bottle, big house, or the box.&quot;
<li> &quot;Death, insanity, or recovery.&quot;
<li> &quot;Always remember the insanity... Be thankful for the pain... But most of all be thankful for the days that remain.&quot;
<li> &quot;The choice I have today is either to be Contented or Demented.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's Bill's way or the you'll get killed way.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's Our Way or the Die Way.&quot;
<li> &quot;Work the Steps, Or Die!&quot;
<li> &quot;Do The Steps or Die.&quot;
<li> &quot;Share Or Die.&quot;

More baloney. Making up a phoney home-made God and endowing it with miraculous powers and
believing that your new &quot;Higher Power&quot; will save your life is the worst kind of superstitious idolatry.
What if your new &quot;god&quot; doesn't feel like obeying your orders and granting your wishes and saving you?
<p>
And who says that a cloudy-headed, confused, detoxing alcoholic whom you just described as
&quot;liar, cheat, or thief&quot; is a wise theologian who can &quot;understand God&quot; correctly?
On the one hand, A.A. declares that
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">newcomers cannot think correctly</a>
&#8212; &quot;Your best thinking got you here&quot; &#8212; and alcoholics are
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; &#8212; and they are loaded with sins that
they need to confess &#8212; and they are &quot;selfish and manipulative and only
care about getting high&quot; &#8212; but they are suddenly good clear-headed theologians who
can pick an appropriate &quot;god&quot; from a myriad of conflicting choices?
That is a major contradiction in the A.A. religion.

<p>
Also, your claim that A.A. does not then qualify as a religion is ridiculous. Of course A.A. is
a religion &#8212; it's just a very illogical
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">heretical</a>
 religion where you can practice idolatry.
<p>
And even worse, you assume that everybody will choose a &quot;God&quot; that conforms to A.A. specifications.
What if &quot;God&quot; does not wish to restore you to sanity in Step 2, or take care of your will and your
life for you in Step 3, or remove all of your shortcomings and defects in Step 7?
Well then, you are screwed. <i>God</i> must &quot;work a strong 12-Step program&quot;, or else you are dead.
<p>
You just assume that &quot;God&quot; will micro-manage the world and do as you wish. If someone believes in
Buddhism, where there is no manipulative God who pulls puppet strings and grants wishes and answers
prayers, then the A.A. program cannot work. In fact, the A.A. program cannot work with any kind of
&quot;God&quot; but the A.A. kind of god.
&quot;God&quot; must be a tyrannical dictatorial micro-managing, meddling, string-pulling puppet master or else
the 12-Step program cannot work.
So you can't have just any kind of God, you must have the A.A. kind of god, or else.
<p>
If you believe that God has nothing better to do with His time than wait on you and answer your prayers and
grant your wishes and save your miserable ass, then you don't believe in God, you believe in Santa Claus.

8. If you ever knew anything about alcoholism, you would know its not about
drinking. Alcoholism happens when you stop drinking. This was the point
Bill was trying to make. We are the bottom of the barrell. We have to live
peacefully somehow, because we can't do it loaded, and we can't do it alone
without alcohol. So the steps are in place to teach us how to live as best
we can, despite our fucked~up~ed~ness. So, if the program helps millions
stop themselves from suicide, homicide, pedricide (pedestrians, of
course)... why on earth are you upset? We aren't hurting you, your family,
your friends. Bill acknowledged he wasn't a saint. Why are you pointing
that out after he did? (I am laughing as I write this)<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is more double-talk. Of course &quot;alcoholism&quot; is about drinking alcohol.
&quot;Alcoholism&quot; is not what &quot;happens when you stop drinking.&quot;
You are trying to completely redefine the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; as something
other than drinking alcohol.
You are trying to make &quot;alcoholism&quot; into a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;
that is not caused by drinking alcohol.
I suspect that what you are really trying to do is push
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#confessions1" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's ideas about <i><b>unconfessed sins</b></i></a>
as the cause of drinking too much alcohol.
And you will probably also try to claim that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is failure to live your life according to
Dr. Frank Buchman's crazy occult practices, although you won't mention Buchman's name or admit where Bill Wilson
got that insane nonsense.
Again, that is another standard cult characteristic, or rather, two of them:
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak" target="_blank">Loaded Language and Redefined Words</a>, and

<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_levels_of_truth" target="_blank">secret insiders-only meanings of words</a>.


<p>
Failure to practice Dr. Frank Buchman's religion properly is not the cause of excessive alcohol consumption,
and Frank's religion is not the cure for alcohol abuse.

<p>
The 12 Steps are
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion recruiting and indoctrination tricks</a>,
not something that teaches people how to live well.

<p>
The statement that we cannot do it alone is just another standard A.A. 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">Big Lie</a>.
Of course we can do it alone. The vast majority of people who successfully sober themselves
up do it alone. Both the Harvard Medical School and the National Institute on
Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism said that.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
The A.A. slogan that &quot;nobody can do it alone&quot; is just another demand that people join the A.A. cult.
<p>
This statement of yours:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have to live peacefully somehow, because we can't do it loaded, and we can't do it alone without alcohol.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
...is again stereotyping alcoholics as bad people.
Who says that we cannot live peacefully alone without alcohol?
Only A.A. members who want us to join their cult  &#8212;  A.A. recruiters who want us to believe that
we really need Alcoholics Anonymous. A.A. just never stops talking about what
bad, defective, immoral people alcoholics really are.
Go read
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy</a>.
<p>
That is another A.A. flip-flop, or bait-and-switch trick:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#alcoholic" target="_blank">First they will tell you that an alcoholic is
just a good person who can't control his drinking, but later they will
tell you that an alcoholic is a disgusting immoral selfish evil creature who
has a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">The medical-to-moral morph: First, alcoholism is a disease to be cured,
and then it is a sin that must be removed by God.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#charming" target="_blank">First, alcoholics are charming, and then they are disgusting.</a>
</ol>

<p>
Alcohol does not help people to &quot;live peacefully&quot;. It tends to make people more violent,
so that whole statement about alcoholics not being able to live peacefully alone without alcohol is nonsense.

<p>
And actually, yes, A.A. is hurting my friends. Seeing that happen is what got me started on the Orange Papers.
(Look 
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters10.html#missing" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
Bill Wilson declaring that he wasn't a saint is just another mind game. He alternated between that
and hinting that he got a Message from God.
So Bill wasn't a saint, but he was a saint. It just depends on which page of the <i>Big Book</i> you are reading.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. does not keep you sober. If you are sober, it's because you keep yourself sober.
You control your own hands and your own mind and you choose not to drink alcohol.
The fact that you waste your spare time by attending the meetings of a cult religion
does not mean that the cult is doing anything good for you.
<p>
And, you just said that you offer to buy drinks for A.A. newcomers. That sure isn't A.A. keeping people sober.
If anybody is sober, it is in spite of your &quot;help&quot;, not because of it.

<p>
Again, I care because A.A. is a fraud that hurts more people than it helps, and some of those
people are friends of mine.

I am still wondering why you choose to berate an entire spiritual program
that has worked for millions of people. Please... at least answer my
questions.

<p>
1. Over two hundred twelve step programs have started since AA... all still
in existance. Therefore, people are staying sober. Why berate something
successful?

<p>
2. If someone is smoking a cig instead of drinking copious amounts of
alcohol and getting into a car~how is that a detriment to you?

<p>
3. If members of a group can choose any God they want, come and go freely,
and choose which suggestions to follow~ how can the group be labeled a cult?

<p>
4. If a sane person were to gather advice, suggestions, and use it in
his\her own life, find peace, and then pass the info on to others, that
would be acceptable.... but an insane person fighting for his\her life
doing the same thing is unacceptable? Does it matter which means I use to
save my life, or do I have to &quot;play fair&quot; to meet your standard?

<p>
5.  If I have a cough for fifteen years, and my doctor tells me I have lung
cancer... when I go home and the cough goes away do I still have lung
cancer? (Assuming yes... can't the same be said for one who stops drinking?
Still an alcoholic? Yes. Wouldn't some form of moral psychology be
necessary?)

<p>
At least have the decency to answer those.

A.A. has not worked for millions. The &quot;millions&quot; number is a blatant lie, one that 
A.A. never tires of repeating.
As I said in the previous letter, I have already discussed and refuted the &quot;millions&quot; number at length,
many times, like here:
<a href="orange-letters317.html#millions" target="_blank">There are no millions saved by A.A.</a>
<p>
And there is nothing &quot;spiritual&quot; about Alcoholics Anonymous. Foisting an old pro-fascist cult
religion from the nineteen-thirties on sick people and lying to them about how well it works
is not spiritual. It is Satanic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You don't even understand what a cult is. Giving people the fake &quot;freedom&quot; to choose any
name for their &quot;higher power&quot; does not change a cult into a good organization.
Go read 
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a> to understand what a cult is.
<p>
Your defenses are irrelevant excuses. To &quot;work a strong program&quot;, an A.A. member must &quot;choose&quot; a
&quot;Higher Power&quot; who grants wishes and answers prayers and takes care of people's wills and lives for them,
and then talks to them in a s&eacute;ance and tells them what to do.
That is not freedom.
<p>
Then, being able to come and go doesn't make an organization not a cult. You can come and go from
Scientology and the Moonies, too. And most other cults.
<p>
And the A.A. &quot;suggestions&quot; are not &quot;suggestions&quot;. They are
demands and instructions. You cannot qualify as a &quot;good member&quot; who is
&quot;working a strong program&quot; unless you do all of the Steps, and more.
<p>
That is just another bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#no_musts" target="_blank">First they tell you that
&quot;There are no <i>'Musts'</i> in Alcoholics Anonymous, only suggestions&quot;,
but then they will tell you that there are

<p>
<font color="blue">
That doesn't make a lot of sense. I would suggest that if someone quits drinking and stays quit
for many years, maybe we shouldn't call him an alcoholic any more.
Maybe an ex-drinker, or maybe just a normal person. Or maybe just human.
It really depends on your definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
A.A. uses at least four different definitions of &quot;alcoholic&quot;, and mixes them up, which confuses the issue.


<p>
<a name="alcoholic_defs"> </a>
<a name="definitions"> </a>
<blockquote>
The definitions are:
<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol,
almost allergic to alcohol, perhaps a genetic alcoholic; someone who cannot drink
even one drink or his drinking will spin out of control and he will
become readdicted to alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is somebody who cannot quit drinking &#8212; he is
 &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">an insane sinner who is full of disgusting character defects</a>
and moral shortcomings and resentments and barely-contained anger,
and is a prime example of self-will run riot and
instincts run wild and selfishness and self-seeking and the Seven Deadly Sins,
although he doesn't think so...  etc., etc., ...
</ol>
<p>
When I call myself an alcoholic, I usually mean definition 2, and only occasionally
definition 1, but never definitions 3 or 4.

<li> By definition 1, I stopped being an alcoholic more than 11 years ago.
<li> By definition 2, I will always be an alcoholic.
<li> By definition 3, I wasn't an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking, and I did.
I was not &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
I even quit drinking without any help from A.A., because I quit drinking two weeks before I
was ever <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">sent to an A.A. meeting</a>.

<li> By definition 4, I was never an alcoholic. I was always a nice drunk.
People liked having me at their parties because I was so much fun to have around
when I got high. (But, as one friend said, &quot;Even nice drunks die of
cirrhosis of the liver...&quot;)

<p>
Your &quot;moral psychology&quot; argument
is just an attempt to declare that ex-drinkers need Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion to
fix their morals. Again, you are flip-flopping between alcoholism being a drinking problem or a moral problem.

Hi,

<p>
I guess, as an outsider, you would view AA as... you do. You aren't in it,
and from what I gather, you haven't gotton the best feedback. Most of the
letters that you posted were hilarious, at best, and mostly~it seems~by
people who left the program early on. It seems like you haven't gotton a
take on AA from anyone truly sober for any significant length of time. I
think, mostly that's because we follow anonymity~ its a personal thing.
Very personal.

<p>
AA is run by the group. There is no leader, not even with world services.
We make decisions as a group. We have no authority. We vote, as a group. We
are criminals, addicts, thieves, etc. I mean, what do you expect? Even our
founders were sick. We don't deny that. But, it isn't what you say it is...
no one has run my life. No one has told me I must or must not do something.
Not one person has threatened me in any way (to include working with the
pacific group). My sponsor has always been more of a friend, someone I have
been able to talk to, and we have always believed that life is more than
aa. I hear &quot;AA is not about drinking, but about living&quot; more times a day
than I can count.

<p>
I was surprised that people were upset that AA'ers were going to bars. We
can do that. The book says we can. In no way is that innapropriate. I was
at a bar last week. Didn't drink a drop of alcohol. Not a big deal to me,
as I do not obsess over alcohol. I have issues with other things, and
alcohol is not one of those things... hasn't been for five years.

<p>
I have yet to meet a recruiter for AA. Uh, I have never heard of such a
thing. I have never been paid a dime for anything AA related. Recruiters
just don't exist. We aren't like the army. There is no place to go where we
sit and sell anything. We simply talk to people about how we stopped, and
stayed stopped. If they want to stop, fine. If not, fine.

<p>
I have yet to hear of any sponsor telling a sponsee not to go to college,
to stop taking medication, etc. My sponsor suggested I get a job, and go to
school. I did both, and my life got better, quickly. Not once have I been
yelled at, even when I was yelling (which, sadly, has happened).

<p>
AA is all over. Bill himself stated that no person should ever sit and rely
completely on AA.  It is in his letter on emotional sobriety. We should not
rely on aa.We are not to sit in the meeting halls and do nothing with our
lives. How do you think we became judges and lawyers and put in position of
power? Two presidents were members of AA. We are encouraged to be
productive. We are encouraged to rebuild our lives. You seem to loathe that
we are in the justice system... yet, you don't seem to understand that
alcoholism can hit anyone of any standing. And, if a judge has multiple
years of sobrity... through AA... he or she would be much more apt to put
people in that program. Do you really believe that judges and lawyers who
have time in sobriety got to that level because they were told to sit in AA?

<p>
Bill and Bob didn't try to recruit people. They didn't even know what they
were doing. The people they spoke with often did not stay sober, but Bill
and BOB did. The same applies. I have had more sponsees drink than I can
count. Doesn't matter to me. I am not in it for numbers.

<p>
<a name="surrender"> </a>
It is common among AA for people to drink. We think something like two out
of ten actually stay sober. Its those two that actually take suggestions
(surrender). Those are the two that rarely fail, as they have followed the
path.

<p>
Not many people want to put that much work into something... many feel it
should magically get better. The steps are actually difficult. Looking at
yourself is not easy, not even for non alcoholics. We live in a world of
quick fixes, medication, and constant therapy. Not many people want to talk
about God.... whatever that is. They want to find the fastest way possible
to beat the game. For me, and many like me, I don't want to beat the game.
There is no game.

<p>
I want to stay alive. I want a better life. Taking a pill every day, going
to church, or therapy... those things didn't work. I tried them all. No one
came to my house and helped me throw out my alcohol. No one helped me mop
the blood off of the bathtub walls, where my head was stuck the night
before. No one recruited me into AA. I stopped drinking, and I showed up in
meeting halls eleven days later.

<p>
You were correct in some of what you wrote. Some people, usually people
with less than five years, talk incessantly about drunk stories, and copy
sponsors. To people with time, it is annoying beyond belief. We often say
fake it till you make it or act as if because they don't know themselves
yet. They don't know how to behave. They don't know what the program is
about. They don't have a sober history... many come from broken homes,
broken families, homelessness, violence, rage, etc. To get to the heart of
the problem, sometimes you have to wait until someone is ready to talk
about what really happened to them, uncover the anger. It actually takes a
long time. Rather than threaten or force them to reveal parts of
themselves, its easier to let them do it on their own~ but they need some
kind of way to get through the day. Make sense?

<p>
Never, ever... have I ever seen any sponsor suggest that a person apologize
to an abuser. Not once. I have never apologized to my biological mother
because I was angry she gave me up. Never have I apologized to my rapist
for my being... all of the millions of emotions and reactions you can think
of. Never once did I ever apologize to my father for my resentment that he
grabbed me by the throat and thrust my head into a windshield. Those things
have never been suggested to me... not once. Some things we don't have a
part in. AA recognizes that.

<p>
I want to quote Jesus, but I am afraid that you will use it and say &quot;see,
its a religion.&quot; I was Catholic before I entered AA. I am still Catholic,
and I never mention it in meetings because I don't want to scare anyone off
(lord, adopted catholic homosexuals are scary to newcomers). But, Jesus did
hang out with liars, thieves, tax collectors, and the like. He used
fanatical tactics (drink my blood...eat me) to weed out people who wanted
the message. There were, what? Tweleve apostles? Not many stayed true to
his cause... people ran from his message too. Churches tend to follow suit
because of the Gospel. Redemption, to them, is always do~able. Therefore,
AA~loaded with misfits and degenerates~ fits right in. They, by default,
are not supposed to judge us. Its usually non~religious pro~therapy nutjobs
who do.

<p>
What they don't realize~ AA is therapy. Cheap, and often entertaining. You
don't even have to pay a buck.

<p>
The poster you have... regarding Sponsorship and Therapy is hilarious. I
saw that on our wall once, as someone had pinned it up in jest. Its as
funny now as it was then.

<p>
I didn't get sober from reading the book and going to meetings. There was a
lot more to it. I also didn't get sober through prayer. Meeting makers
don't make it~ some commit suicide. But, those of us who do the Whole
program~which is more than the twelve steps~we manage. We aren't forced to
make coffee or take out trash. To this day, I have yet to drink coffee...
let alone make it.

The fact that I'm not now in A.A. does not preclude me from understanding what is going on in there.
<p>
And I have gotten letters from many people, even just recently a 35-year oldtimer

of feedback from all kinds of people.

No leaders? That is mythology. Of course there are leaders. The creeps at the Interchurch Center in New York City
run Alcoholics Anonymous from above, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">
 sue A.A. members who publish their own literature</a> and carry the message to poor alcoholics.
<p>
The previous leader of A.A. was Greg Muth, and 
the current chair of the General Service Board, elected in 2009, is the Very
Reverend Ward Ewing, Class A Trustee and just retired President, General Theological Seminary, NYC (Episcopal).
<p>
You may vote in A.A., but your vote doesn't count for anything. Just try to replace the Chairman or General Manager or
Board of Trustees. You can't. A.A. is fake democracy. Your vote controls nothing except how you
decorate your local clubhouse.
<p>
No one has told you that you must do anything? Get real. That is just another untrue A.A. slogan.
There are zillions of things that you must do in A.A.:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Attend meetings.
<li> Work the steps.
<li> Don't drink.
<li> Surrender.
<li> Believe.
<li> Share.
<li> Don't criticize The Program.

I have.

Two Presidents were members of A.A.? Oh really? Do you mean Presidents of the United States? Which two?
Please prove that statement. Historically, it's very important.

<p>
If a judge has multiple years of sobriety in A.A., and that makes him sentence people to his favorite
cult religion, that judge is breaking the law and should be impeached and disbarred. And now the law
says that he can be personally sued for violating the civil rights of the people whom he sentences to A.A.

beliefs &#8212; &quot;for his own good&quot; &#8212; the patient didn't get any
say in the matter. (That is still the attitude of many so-called counselors.)

<p>
That is yet another standard A.A. bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#discuss_numbers" target="_blank">First, they talk about numbers, and then
they refuse to discuss numbers.
Likewise, first they claim a great success rate, and then they refuse
to discuss the success rate.</a>

It is common among AA for people to drink. We think something like two out
of ten actually stay sober. Its those two that actually take suggestions
(surrender). Those are the two that rarely fail, as they have followed the
path.<br>

</blockquote>


<p>
<font color="blue">
What you are saying is that the A.A. program does not work. And surrender to the cult
is not necessary for quitting drinking; it's only necessary for becoming a brainwashed cult member.
<p>
A.A. does not even deserve the credit for those two success stories out of ten. There is such a thing as normal
spontaneous remission. Alcoholics just get sick and tired of being so sick and tired, and they
quit drinking and improve their lives. (Just like how you and I did it.)
About five percent of the alcoholics wise up and quit drinking and save their lives each year.
 Then A.A. tries to steal the credit for every sober person
who wanders in the door, even when their quitting had nothing to do with A.A.

Not many people want to put that much work into something... many feel it
should magically get better. The steps are actually difficult. Looking at
yourself is not easy, not even for non alcoholics. We live in a world of
quick fixes, medication, and constant therapy. Not many people want to talk
about God.... whatever that is. They want to find the fastest way possible
to beat the game. For me, and many like me, I don't want to beat the game.
There is no game.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you are trying to explain away the A.A. failure rate by saying that those
people didn't &quot;work the program&quot; hard enough. Baloney. The program just
doesn't work. Frank Buchman's cult religion is not the cure for alcohol addiction. And
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the 12 Steps are nothing but Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult recruiting and indoctrination practices</a>.

before. No one recruited me into AA. I stopped drinking, and I showed up in
meeting halls eleven days later.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
No you didn't &quot;try them all&quot;. That is another standard A.A. slogan:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I tried them all, I tried everything, and nothing worked until I found A.A.&quot;
</font>
Baloney.  You did not try them all.
<p>
Did you try SMART? How about SOS or Lifering or Moderation Management or HAMS?
Or the Catholic programs like Calix or St. Vincent de Paul?
Or the Protestant Evangelist Rick Warren's Christianity-based
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Saddleback" target="_blank">Saddleback program</a>?
The Salvation Army program? The Veterans Administration program?
Brief Intervention? Rational Recovery? Natrexone and the Sinclair Method?
<p>
For a list of 48 different programs or treatments or methods, and their effectiveness,
<a href="orange-letters252.html#Rodney_R" target="_blank">look here</a>.
<p>
You did not try every other way. So how many different ways did you really try?
<p>
Then, you tell me that you just quit on your own. Congratulations. Good.
 You quit drinking without A.A. And yet you write me letters telling me
that people cannot do it alone.
<p>
So what really happened is, you got good and sick and tired of being sick and tired, so you finally
quit drinking. Then you went to A.A., where they brainwashed you into believing that their program worked on you.
Which it obviously didn't. You quit drinking before you ever went to A.A. So did I.

You were correct in some of what you wrote. Some people, usually people
with less than five years, talk incessantly about drunk stories, and copy
sponsors. To people with time, it is annoying beyond belief. We often say
fake it till you make it or act as if because they don't know themselves
yet. They don't know how to behave. They don't know what the program is
about. They don't have a sober history... many come from broken homes,
broken families, homelessness, violence, rage, etc. To get to the heart of
the problem, sometimes you have to wait until someone is ready to talk
about what really happened to them, uncover the anger. It actually takes a
long time. Rather than threaten or force them to reveal parts of
themselves, its easier to let them do it on their own~ but they need some
kind of way to get through the day. Make sense?<br>

What you are describing is the process of brainwashing and indoctrination and conversion to a cult religion.
&quot;Fake it until you make it&quot; because &quot;They don't know how to behave.&quot;
That is just the opposite of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, of course.
<p>

You are describing several standard cult characteristics there:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">33. Newcomers can't think right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_compliance" target="_blank">89. Demands For Compliance With The Group</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">90. Newcomers Need Fixing.</a>
</ul>
<p>
And the A.A. answers to those questions are here:

because I was angry she gave me up. Never have I apologized to my rapist
for my being... all of the millions of emotions and reactions you can think
of. Never once did I ever apologize to my father for my resentment that he
grabbed me by the throat and thrust my head into a windshield. Those things
have never been suggested to me... not once. Some things we don't have a
part in. AA recognizes that.<br>

I'm glad to hear that you didn't apologize to the people who abused you.
Nevertheless, those are the instructions that other people have received.

I want to quote Jesus, but I am afraid that you will use it and say &quot;see,

and I never mention it in meetings because I don't want to scare anyone off
(lord, adopted catholic homosexuals are scary to newcomers). But, Jesus did
hang out with liars, thieves, tax collectors, and the like. He used
fanatical tactics (drink my blood...eat me) to weed out people who wanted
the message. There were, what? Tweleve apostles? Not many stayed true to
his cause... people ran from his message too. Churches tend to follow suit
because of the Gospel. Redemption, to them, is always do~able. Therefore,
AA~loaded with misfits and degenerates~ fits right in. They, by default,
are not supposed to judge us. Its usually non~religious pro~therapy nutjobs
who do.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
The history of Jesus Christ has nothing to do with Alcoholics Anonymous.
Do you really think that Bill Wilson was a new Jesus Christ?
The founding of the Christian Church was nothing like the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous.
The way that you compare the two makes it sound like you think that Alcoholics Anonymous is the second
coming of a great religion.
<p>
By the way, you said that A.A. is not a religion. So why are you comparing A.A. to the early Christian
Church, and trying to say that they are similar? Obviously, you do believe that A.A. <i>IS</i> a religion.
That is yet another standard A.A. flip-flop: First, A.A. is not a religion, and then it is.

I'm not sure which &quot;poster&quot; you are talking about. If you are talking about
the
<a href="orange-not_good.html#NIAAA" target="_blank">A.A. Northern Illinois Area Service Newsletter</a>
screed about an A.A. sponsor versus a therapist, it was not a joke. They really meant it.
They are that crazy.
They published that as real A.A. propaganda, declaring that A.A. was better than a therapist.
I'm glad to hear that you also find it insane.
It <i>is</i> insane. Unfortunately, that is the quality of advice that you get from Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Right. From what you have told me, you quit drinking on your own after you got sick enough.
Unfortunately, you then went and joined a cult.
You really should have gone someplace else instead, like the Ladies' Home Garden Club.
You would be better off, and happier too.
<p>
The rest of it, about how A.A. doesn't work, and some members commit suicide, is not news to me.
That's what I've been telling you all along.

Have a good day now.
