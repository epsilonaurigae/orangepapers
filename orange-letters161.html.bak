Subject:  	Deprogramming from the other side of the pond...<br>

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
Thank you so much for publishing so much and such detailed material. It has been a
life-saver.

<p>
I am in London, UK and have been an AA member for about 2.5 years.
It was an e-mail from my sponsor and a whole host of bad experiences in AA that
prompted me to look for the other side of the story.

<p>
It sound like things are worse in the US &#8212; AA over here has probably retained a bit
of 'Britishness' that makes it slightly more reserved. My experience is still of
brainwashing, exploitation, dangerous advice and a very high failure rate.

<p>
I wonder if anyone else has written to you from the UK? If there is enough support I
am really keen to start an alternative recovery fellowship over here that believes
in true freedom. AA has a total monopoly at present.

<p>
There are many stories 'round here of vunerable newcomers being told to stop
medication/therapy and then committing suicide. These are blamed on 'cult
infiltration' by 'extremist' AA groups. Yet little can be done through the AA
heirarchy to stop these groups (I have tried &#8212; when you e-mail GSO they brushed me
off like a fly the second time, the first time I didn't get an answer.) Members
gossip but do little else. I called a group conscience &#8212; all the gossips didn't show
up to testify, I was a lone voice bar one other.

<p>
These are some of my experiences:

<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
Old timer trying to tell me cleaning their house would be service to the fellowship
<p><li>
Old timer telling me to leave my relationship as I was 'not ready' at 2 years sober
<p><li>
Threatening phone calls and harrasment (by a member who had bullied me into taking
a job working for her when I was a newcomer by telling me lies that she knew my
current employer was going to go bust &#8212; these phone calls were then made when I
became sick thru stress after only 6 wks of working for this crazy b*tch.)
<p><li>
being pressurised into secretary 'service' then bullied &#8212; pulled into the kitchen,
being shouted at and told that I was saying the wrong. When I raised this, I was
told I had a 'resentment'
<p><li>
I have other newcomers who have been told by their sponsor not to talk to other
members, and email their feelings to sponsor everyday.
</ul>

<p>
I could go on forever....
<p>
I personally have found the step work traumatic and humiliating. I would say to
anyone who has any form of childhood trauma NEVER to do the steps at all. If you do
make sure u have real psychotherapy.
<p>
My step 4/5 kicked off buried memories of childhood trauma that kicked off Post
traumatic Stress Disorder &#8212; I virtually had a breakdown and no-one in the fellowship
supported me, bar my sponsor who spoke on the phone a couple of times a week and,
after I had done my step 5 which kicked it off &#8212; DIDN'T MEET WITH ME FOR ANOTHER 9
MONTHS.

<p>
I had no family support (I am an only child of VVVVVV disfunctional parent's) and
doctors who couldn't have cared less.
<p>
I kept going back to AA in the hope of finding that loving, benevolent fellowhip
that I was always being told about.
<p>
In fairness, meetings held me together in one way cos I didn't have much else left,
but in hindsight I needed proper psychotherapy. My true friends outside of AA
supported me more than AA friends.
<p>
I have found in AA that 'a friend in need is a friend indeed' they all turn up when
they want you to do service. Thru all this time I was doing 'chairs' public
confessionals as I was told they would help me. I kept doing teas etc.

<p>
My sponsor has helped me &#8212; mainly through her passing on therapy she has done around
boundaries/co-dependance, rather than AA wisdom. Recently, however, the tables turn
when I got myself better and started to get a life.

<p>
It sounds like you are awake to some of the wider political conspiracies that are
occuring in our times. So am I, and have got involved in peace campaigning and
raising awareness of things such as CIA complicity in 9/11.

<p>
My sponsor then started attacking my stance, saying I was 'extremist', 'childish'
'not taking responsibility for living in society' and 'disease is driving the bus'
She said I should not campaign against the Iraq/Afghanistan wars because 'we are
alcoholics and we have to be careful' and 'God has a plan and God has the monopoly
on the truth.'

<p>
The war is NOT in my God's plan. It Might be in Satan's, but not God's.

<p>
This was the final straw. I have always wondered why AA people were the craziest and
most Hypocritical I knew.. Now it is all falling into place. Their program of
'powerlessness' makes them like that.

<p>
I am a Christian and I totally see the Heresy in the steps. The ONLY 'God' who wants
your will and life is Satan. God as I know him gives us free will and personal
responsibility.
<p>
I emailed her a response explaining why I beleive what I do and why I take the stand
I do.
<p>
She admitted she had not read my response, instead attacking from another angle &#8212; 
that I was 'not putting recovery 1st.'
<p>
BTW, she has suggested I volunteer in an animal sancuary &#8212;  that is ok.. I am allowed
to help the fluffy bunnies but not the slaughtered innocent children....

<p>
She is 'concerned' that I am a peace campaigner &#8212;  but didn't bother to come and see
me for 9 months when I was having a step-induced nervous breakdown?

<p>
I did my last chair and the woman who had threatened me shared back how 'lovely' it
was to see me. Hypocrite. That was my last confessional &#8212;  I am OUT of the cult.
I will not be told how to live my life, what to believe or what God wants from me.
My sponsor is telling me that I must not stand against Gencide because I am in an AA
program..... so should I support it? Or turn a blind eye like she does?

<p>
I have been on some other blogs/sites recently and you can really tell the AA
members by the way they speak. They speak in slogans, and they can not take
constructive critisism. they have become like AA.
<p>
I have stayed sober, but not easily. I have often thought how much easier it would
be if I were not saying 'I'm an alcoholic' all the time.

<p>
God knows what I am going to do now, I have little in my life but AA. I can't bear
it any more though, and it gives me hope that I am not the only one, and that you
and others have stayed clean without it. I have been really feeling recently that
these nutters would drive me back to a drink.

<p>
I am keen to start a website showing the other side of UK-AA and maybe one day an
alternative support group. First I have to go about trying to de-program my confused
mind.

<p>
Thanks

<p>

Hello Anon,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and it's good to hear from somebody on the other side
of the pond. Sorry to take so long to answer  &#8212;  I've been going through housing
difficulties that took up too much time and kept me offline for a while. But I'm
back now.
<p>
Congratulations on thinking for yourself, and remaining sane in the madhouse.
And yes, I've received some other letters from England, Scotland, and a few other parts
of Great Britain. I have a few regular readers on your side of the pond.

<p>
You make a lot of great points. Let me start at the bottom, and say &quot;Thank you&quot; for
your anti-war work. That is great, and a good thing to do. The argument that us
alcoholics cannot get involved in such causes is a bunch of bull.
We can and should do such things. (And if we don't, we will feel guilty about it
years later.)
We are not powerless, and there is much more to life than just
sitting in meetings and only
talking about alcoholism and sobriety. The &quot;real world&quot; is not an &quot;outside issue&quot;.
<p>
Thanks for the horror story, and yes, it's often just like that over here too.

<p>
I totally agree that the Steps can cause real problems by dredging up memories of
traumatic childhood abuse.
And inducing guilt, and demanding that you &quot;find your part in it&quot;, is even worse.
Many alcoholics had alcoholic parents themselves, and they have a lot
of bad memories that are either better left forgotten, or handled by a real counselor.
Twenty years of hard drinking, and then several years of membership in a cult religion,
does not make disturbed people into competent counselors.


<p>

That would be good for a lot of people.

<p>
Above all, remember that you don't have to be perfect or know everything
 to start and lead a recovery group  &#8212; 
you just have to be better than Alcoholics Anonymous, and that is pathetically
easy to do.
I know that you are already there.
You can learn the rest as you go along.

Are you saying that when Jesus Christ stated that HE alone was the only way

<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You know, that line from Jesus Christ is one of the most
misunderstood lines in the Gospels.  When Jesus Christ was baptized by John the
Baptist, the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; entered into Him, and from that moment on Jesus had
a dual personality where one minute he could be talking as Jesus, and the next
minute as the Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit or God.
(Unfortunately, people get confused about who is saying what.)
<p>
For instance, as He died on the cross, He cried out, &quot;My Father,
my Father, why hast thou forsaken
me?&quot; That was Jesus talking, not God.
<p>
On the other hand, Christ clearly showed who was talking in your quote:
&quot;I am the Truth and the Light and the Way, and only through Me will you get into Heaven.&quot;

<p>
He did not say, &quot;I am Jesus, and only by kissing my ass will you get into Heaven.&quot;

<p>
I can agree with the statement that you must go through the Truth and the Light to
get to Heaven. That is not cultish. That is very universal. All of the major religions
of the world strive to steer their followers into the Truth and the Light.
<p>
And consider the opposite: You sure won't get into Heaven by going through
Lies and Darkness.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

Subject:  	you rock<br>

<p>
Quite a crusade you've put together. If you weren't so damned spot on with every
subject, and so well written (not to mention LOADED with supporting ammunition), one
might think that the seemingly endless literary juggernaut thrust upon the steppers
could be misconstrued as the life's work of a maniacal demon. However that's stinkin
thinkin and I apologize, and digress...
<p>
Your translation of Trimpey's work
 (<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>) was in my
opinion, a brilliant and vivid portrait of a very logical plan. Although I am still
confused about the theoretic differences between Peele's &quot;anyone can learn anything&quot;
principle and Trimpey's &quot;anyone can learn anything, but watch out for the beast&quot;
mantra, I now know that my options in the area of addiction are without bounds. I am
free to think and speak and question without guilt, shame or the constant nagging
feeling that if I don't hurry up and place my brain-dead soul in the hands of
God (however that is done), I will die.
<p>
It's nice to know that my inner belief that this has been up to me all along has
not been an exclusive thought. And while the basement dwellers bitch and moan about
how their lives suck and will continue to suck, (but I'm sober TODAY, thank you
Jesus) waiting for me to crawl back to their open arms in the shame that can only be
felt by Hitler, Judas, John Wayne Gasey, and me, so that I may feel the grace of God
wipe away my sins, and my thoughts. Teach me how stupid I am, because remember, I'm
a short-timer again. Ripe to be treated like the dirty old bum that I am. Thank you
fellowship. I'll try reeeeeeeeeal hard this time because I know I'm lucky to be
alive, and next time I'll surely be dead.

Hi orange,
<p>
i wont go into big drunkalogues but wow thanks for the website.
what an eye opener. I have been out of the 12 step madness for a good couple
of months now and what a relief it feels.
<p>
 I find that inducing fear seems to be one of their big points.
When i first read your papers i have to admit i
thought you were displaying a lot of anger but judging from what you have
seen with your friends i cant blame you.
 i too am really quite bitter towards
this so-called &quot;help group&quot;, based on my own experiences with it.
I run a SMART
recovery over in England and what a breath of fresh air to be able to talk
openly how you really feel without risk of been ridiculed.
<p>
I find it rather
funny that any other illness that you recover from everyone seems to be so
happy for you, yet the minute you say that you have recovered from alcoholism
you get laughed at, sneered at, and told you're heading for relapse haha.
<p>
I find that one of the biggest tools to obtain in recovery is a positive self
esteem and lots of confidence.  AA certainly does not give you that, rather
they like to tell you you're powerless etc. what a joke.
<p>
Talking about the brain washing part when people say, &quot;yeah but i
 needed brain washing&quot; or &quot;at least they are sober&quot;.
Why dont they go tell this bullshit to people who have lost
family memebers and loved ones to this brain washing?
<p>
Like i once got told, orange,
&quot;If this is a disease, it's the first disease you can go and buy from a
shop.&quot; etc. lol.
<p>
Anyways orange, many thanks for the website.  We need more people
like yourself who expose this cult for what it really is.
 Like you say, i too aint really bothered if a load of burnt out alkies wanna talk about their
war stories and how they were so much worse than any other person, but surely
we can do better than sending people to this place.
<p>
Anyways orange, as this
was my first message and its 7.24am at the moment here over in England.
 i
havent gone into too much but i certainly am gunna keep in touch.
<p>
Once again
orange many thanks and keep up the great service you provide.

I just got a letter from a woman in England who wants to start some kind of

Hi there A. Orange,

<p>
Your web site: http://www.orange-papers.info/ is awesome. I only discovered it in the
past 2 days. What I really like about it is that your articles about Mind Control
and deprogramming not only apply to AA, I honestly believe it applies to anything
related to mind control.

<p>
In my humble view, a vast majority of Americans are brain washed. They do not under
stand that their freedom and their rights have been taken away from them.

<p>
In checking out your web site I did not see your name there. My name is Mitch.

You can check out a radio show I help produce called THE AMERICAN FREEDOM REPORT,
it might be great to have you on as a guest sometime.

Hello Mitch,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And yes, I have to agree that there are a whole
lot of brainwashed people out there, and the sheeple are being sheared of their rights,
one by one. (Now, it's to &quot;save us from terrorists.&quot;)
<p>
And yes, all of those mind-bending brainwashing and propaganda techniques are widely applicable,
and common to most cults and also most radical political organizations.
A.A. did not invent anything new. Bill Wilson just copied it all from Frank Buchman's
<i>Oxford Group</i> cult, and Buchman, in turn, had copied his stuff from his mentor
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Wright" target="_blank">Prof. Henry B. Wright of Yale University</a>,
 who had found &quot;the four standards&quot; in the writings of Robert E. Speer. And Heaven only knows
where Speer got the stuff...
(See: Wright, <u>The Will of God</u>, and, Speer, <u>The Principles of Jesus</u>.)

<p>
My birth name is Terrance Hodgins, and I'm now living in Forest Grove, Oregon, close to
Pacific University.
<p>
By the way, I just found an obscure old biography of Adolf Hitler at a Goodwill.
The author was really sharp and perceptive.
The book is
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Heiden" target="_blank"><i>Der Fuehrer</i>, by Konrad Heiden</a>,
 published in 1944,
while Hitler was still alive. Thus, the book concentrates on Hitler's rise to power;
his end was still unknown.  I just typed in a long quote about Hitler's propaganda
techniques, for the <i>Propaganda and Debating Techniques</i> web page,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Heiden" target="_blank">here</a>.
Check it out.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
It appears that you are an intelligent person that has lost his focus on dealing
with positive life lessons. So much energy was put in your paper discrediting
something that is good for people. You seem to miss the mark. If this program was
not helping people why is it worldwide. Why is it still working for countless of
other. Something must of happened to you to cause you so much hate for something
that is proven to save so many lives. Maybe you lost someone you loved that the 12
steps did not keep alive. If that is the case I am sorry for you loss. But you must
understand that not everyone is capable of getting honest with their self and leave
the past behind. In such cases many do falter and sub come back to their drinking or
drugging behavior. Those are the one that don't make it. I have had many relatives
that could not get honest with their self and let go of the past, many that died in
their disease. 5 in their early 50's, 1 in his 40's, 2 in their 30's and the worst
was 1 in his very early 20's. The 12 steps to them are what it is to you. all I know
is it saved my life, I was at the brink of death.  I give God and the 12 step
program all the credit. I would not be succeeding in life being a productive member
of society, business owner, and counselor if it weren't for A.A. and the 12 steps. I
am truly sorry that you fill compelled to take something good trying to make it bad.
I'm sad for you.

<p>
My thoughts and prayer are with you to better focus yourself on positive things of
life. You appear to have so much to offer, but is being dragged down with the
negativity of life. Peace be with you and may you find the true meaning of life and
the ways to find that meaning.  Love, kindness and forgiveness.

<p>
P.S. there is so much negative things going on in the world, leave alone what is
good for so many. The truth is, people who are living the 12 step lives is none of
your business.

<font color="blue">
Hello Lisa,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and congratulations on your sobriety.
Unfortunately, you have made a large number of grossly wrong assertions
and assumptions in your letter. Starting at the top:

<ol>

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;...something that is good for people. ... Why is it still working for countless of
other.&quot;<br>
</font>
A.A. is not &quot;working&quot;. It is a fraud and a hoax.
A.A. harms more people than it helps. That is why I criticize it.
Read about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;If this program was not helping people why is it worldwide.&quot;<br>
</font>
For the same reason as Scientology and the Moonies are worldwide. And Transcendental Meditation,
and the Hari Krishnas (ISKCON),
and the &quot;<a href="orange-rroot750.html" target="_blank">Initiatives For Change</a>&quot; successor of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament cult...

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;all I know is it saved my life,&quot;<br>
</font>
Well then, you don't know very much, do you? It is easy to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">confuse causation with coincidence</a>.
Just because you were doing something like playing tiddly-winks, eating ice cream, or attending
the meetings of a cult religion when you quit drinking, does not mean that those things
caused you to quit drinking.



<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;I have had many relatives that could not get honest with their self
 and let go of the past, many that died in their disease.&quot;<br>
</font>
I'm sorry to hear about the deaths of your relatives. But the answer to addiction is not
<font color="black">
&quot;get honest with their self and let go of the past&quot;.
</font>
 That is just A.A. dogma, totally untrue. The real reason why they died
is because they refused to quit drinking alcohol.
And &quot;alcoholism&quot; is not a disease, either. It is habitual behavior &#8212; a bad habit.


<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;I give God and the 12 step program all the credit.&quot;<br>
</font>
So which is it? God and the 12 Steps are very different things, not the same at all.
In fact, the 12 Steps are heretical, unBiblical, and anti-Christian. Read 
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.


<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;I would not be succeeding in life being a productive member
of society, business owner, and counselor if it weren't for A.A. and the 12 steps.&quot;<br>
</font>
Actually, you would not be all of those things if you had not quit drinking alcohol.
Again, you are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">confusing causation with correlation</a>.
<p>
What shape would you be in if you faithfully went to A.A. meetings and did
the 12 Steps and constantly fervently confessed all of your sins,
while still routinely drinking many fifths of whiskey?
<p>
And you are a <i><b>counselor</b></i>? Does that mean that you collect money for
&quot;counseling&quot; sick people, while actually foisting the 12-Step cult religion
&#8212; your favorite religion &#8212; on them? That's quite a serious conflict of interest and
ethical violation, isn't it?
Now I can see why you are so desperate to defend Alcoholics Anonymous. You have to convince
yourself that you are not doing anything wrong by selling Steppism to your clients.


<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;...leave alone what is good for so many. The truth is, people who
are living the 12 step lives is none of your business.&quot;<br>
</font>
Again, A.A. harms more people than it helps. And it is my business when A.A. perpetrates
a fraud and harms my friends.
<p>
You should read the other letters that I get, with the stories of their A.A. experiences.
You can start with just the last half dozen letters,
<a href="orange-letters161.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
Then, a list of A.A. horror stories is

From: Anon.<br>
Subject: question about AA<br>
<p>
Hey Orange,

<p>
I came across your site when researching Sam Shoemaker and the Oxford
Movement. Very interesting stuff. I wanted to ask your opinion on something
I've been thinking about as I read over some of your papers. (Feel free to
re-post this in your letters if you want; just take my name and any
identifying marks off of the e-mail.)

<p>
I got sober a little over a year ago. I'd been drinking more or less since I
was 17 (since 1988), but I guess I feel like &#8212; looking back &#8212; I think my
drinking really reached epic proportions only when I lived 2 years in
Germany from '04 &#8212; '06. In January 2009, having continued this trend after I
returned to the States, I totally cracked up (perhaps this wasn't only from
drinking, I'm not sure), had a nervous breakdown, and ended up in a Psych
ward first for about a week and then a short rehab/dry-out for a week after
that. The doctors diagnosed alcoholism and Bi-polar 1. I didn't have any
sort of probate hearing (although I'm told I made a big fuss coming in), and
no one sentenced me to AA, but it was highly encouraged, and seemed to be
the way to get out of the detox, so I picked up a chip and was released to
the care of my sister who had come down from up north to help me out.

<p>
Anyway, what I'm thinking is this: After a year in AA, I see how a lot of
what you're saying is true, e.g., about the bait-and-switch tactics, the
whole problem with the notion of powerlessness, etc. Yet I feel like that
first year (and especially that first half-year) in AA got me something,
because it did make me think about the things that I'd left undone because
of alcohol, or had done in a mediocre fashion, things I had screwed up
because of my drinking, and ways in which I'd been really selfish and just
wasteful of my talents. It showed me the ways that alcohol was damaging my
life, in other words.

<p>
I feel like these weren't things that I would have gotten on my own
(especially given all of the pills they were throwing at me back then, which
kept me in a permanent haze). Now that the haze has worn off, of course, I
feel more inclined to your opinions about these things, but I wonder if
there isn't some sort of middle way.

<p>
For me, I don't have any major problems with religion. I was raised Catholic
and I don't really see any problem with notions like belief in God,
confession, and reparation. When I read the 12 steps, I saw just something
like the Catholic way of life (with the exception of the bit about
powerlessness, unmanageability, and insanity):  believe in God, examine your
conscience every now and then, confess your sins, ask for help to be a
better person and make it up to those you've done wrong to.

<p>
I realize that may sound all a bit naive &#8212; to each his own &#8212; but the
thought I've been having in reading your website is that there is a way to
go about freeing myself (or, more accurately, remaining free ) from alcohol
that incorporates a religious dimension (not Buchmanism, but one that I find
congenial) while at the same time recognizing that it's up to my free will
to pick up a drink or not.

<p>
Anyway, sorry to go on at such length &#8212; I'd just be curious to hear your
response to that train of thought, because it seems like you're someone who
has thought a lot about these things. What do you think? Can that work? Is
your objection to AA mainly that it tries to hide its religious / cult
(Buchmanite) motives, instead of admitting them openly...? Please respond
when you have a moment &#8212; there's no rush,

<p>
Sincerely yours,<br>
anon
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anon,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations for your sobriety.
 Sorry to take so long to answer, but I was unavoidably distracted.
<p>
Starting at the bottom, and working backwards, I have a lot of objections to A.A. The
hidden religious aspect is actually one of the least of my worries. If I had to
pick out one thing, it would be: A.A. hurts people. A.A. hurts people in quite a variety
of ways,
<ul>
<li> ranging from giving them misinformation about alcohol abuse and alcohol dependency,
<li> to telling them that they are powerless over their problem,
<li> to telling them that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_reliance" target="_blank">self-reliance is a bad thing</a>,
<li> to inducing feelings of guilt and inadequacy,
<li> to telling them not to take their medications.
<li> I don't know if I should even mention the sexual exploitation of newcomers. 
<a href="orange-letters158.html#sexual" target="_blank">Some groups do it</a>; some don't.
</ul>
<p>
For the list of my objections to A.A., this web page is a good one:
<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>
<p>
Now then, on to your main question: About getting some good things out of A.A.:
You can do that. A.A. is not all bad.  There are some true things that get taught
in A.A. meetings, now and then.  And once in a blue moon you may have the luck to
run into a wise old-timer who can truthfully answer your questions and give sage
advice. Look here for some of them:

<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters8.html#NRL" target="_blank">Newcomer Rescue League, here</a>.)
<li> <a href="orange-letters30.html#Rescue_League" target="_blank">here</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters45.html#Rescue_League" target="_blank">here</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters52.html#Rescue_League" target="_blank">here</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters136.html#NRL" target="_blank">here</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters149.html#NRL1" target="_blank">here</a>
</ol>

<p>
The problem for you, of course, is to sort out the good and true stuff from the bullshit,
while avoiding getting hurt or misled.
Sometimes that is very difficult, especially when you are just recovering from
an alcohol-induced fog.
<p>
Oh, and please do remember that you can also learn a lot of the same good things
in a variety of other groups like SMART, Lifering, or SOS. So you have some choices.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

<p>
So, did Tiger get into a 12 step program?

Hello Frank,
<p>
That's a darned good question. When I heard that Tiger Woods was in &quot;treatment&quot;
for &quot;sex addiction&quot;, I kind of raised an eye-brow. What kind of a treatment program
could that be?  (And does it really work, or is it quackery? Is Tiger confessing his sins
in
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#SAA" target="_blank">SAA</a> meetings?)
<p>
It's odd how so many things now require &quot;treatment&quot;. It really does remind
me of Stanton Peele's phrase, &quot;The Diseasing of America&quot;.
<p>
Everything is a &quot;disease&quot;, and everything requires &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>
Next, I suppose we really will have children in treatment for &quot;Ice-cream-itis&quot;.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I was wondering where I could get some more information such as you have on your
site.  I was also wondering what the statistics are for marriages that go under
while one partner is in AA and the other refuses to play by their rules.  Thanks for
any more information you can give me.  Why is there not more information out there?

Hello Julie,
<p>
Thanks for the question. It's a good one, and I wish I had the answer. I do not have
any solid statistics on the A.A. divorce rate. I know that it is high; I get plenty of
letters talking about the marriages that A.A. has destroyed, but I just don't have any
hard numbers for it. And I don't think that anybody else does either.
<p>
For a sampling of stories, look here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters51.html#divorce" target="_blank">My husband has changed,
 since his indoctrination into AA five years ago, into a person I truly don't know.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters33.html#divorce" target="_blank">Thanks AA for helping alcoholics
have their marriages torn asunder</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters38.html#divorce" target="_blank">I have been sober and clean for 25+ yrs. I had it made or I should
say we had it made till my wife decided to get a sponsor.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown4" target="_blank">The Midtown Group encouraged a
policeman's wife to cheat on her husband and to divorce him.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters97.html#na_cult" target="_blank">relationship destroyed by N.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters79.html#tc_nightmare" target="_blank">rehab romance destroys relationship</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters79.html#romances2" target="_blank">a discussion of how treatment centers destroy relationships</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters90.html#horror" target="_blank">...he's not only stopped drinking, he's stopped living.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters121.html#horror" target="_blank">...we are getting divorced,
and I think it all comes down to her sponsor and AA indoctrination...</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#AA_divorces" target="_blank">more on A.A. divorces</a>
</ul>

<p>
Why are there no better statistics? First off, A.A. actively resists the collection of
embarrassing statistics. They have even stopped asking the embarrassing questions that
I ferretted out of their triennial surveys. When the surveys revealed the A.A. dropout rate,
they avoided those questions in the next survey. When the surveys revealed that 61% of
the membership had been coerced into A.A., they stopped asking about that.

<p>
Then, they declare that they have no membership list, and everybody is anonymous, so it
isn't possible to calculate things like the A.A. divorce rate.
Likewise, they supposedly also cannot figure out the A.A. failure rate, or the dropout rate.

<p>
Isn't it odd that there are so few valid statistics that tell the truth
 about the &quot;treatment program&quot;
that is used by 93% of the &quot;treatment centers&quot; in the USA?

<p>
What is even stranger is that health insurance companies still pay for such quackery.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Kevin G.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Relapse and the Steps<br>

<p>
You know what really upset my mind with AA when I first got to thinking
about it (the BIG sin right?).  If you have been drinking everyday for 3
years straight, and you are able to quit and start dealing with your
problems, but then you &quot;relapse&quot; and drink for a couple of days, for some
reason, you have to start at the beginning.   Do not pass go, Do not collect
$200.  You are back at the beginning.  Which, through the language of the
steps, means that in 2 DAYS your life has become unmanageable and you can
not bring yourself back.  That makes no sense to me.  Dealing with the
problems and feelings that got us to choose drinking or using is a
marathon.  It takes time.  You have to deal with hiccups and small set
backs.  How else will you learn?  If you know you have problems, and are
dealing with them, have a hiccup, you are not at square one, because I
guarantee you have learned something about yourself that you did not know
before.

<p>
AA, on the other hand is a marathon with no finish line.  Its no wonder that
people who continue to go and not question eventually give in.  They tire
and HAVE to give up.  In AA, if you relapse, you have obviously learned
nothing.  But if you have learned nothing, then what is the point in doing
the steps?  You're not going to learn anything anyway?  What is the point in
a treatment that doesn't let you graduate or fix your problems for good?
Sometimes, I have heard Alcoholism (a word I hate to use) is like Cancer.
However, if you successfully go through treatment, whether chemo, radiation,
or surgery, you return to your former life.  Yes, you keep an eye on it, but
you don't stay on the treatments.  What would be the point in chemo if you
had to stay on chemo for the rest of your life?  Guess what!  IT WILL KILL
YOU!

<p>
That's all I have to say.  Changing isn't going to happen over night, but it
will happen.  If you make mistakes, it does not mean you have to start back
at zero.  It means you just have to learn from them.  &quot;Alcoholism&quot; isn't a
disease, its a symptom, and the only way to deal with it, is to deal with the
problems and neuroses we have and not to add more by becoming ignorant and
superstitious.

<p>
Thanks for your site,<br>

Subject:  	7 Weeks to Sobriety<br>

<p>
Hello Agent Orange

<p>
First and foremost I want to thank you for taking the initiative to write, maintain,
and educate the masses with your website. I do honestly believe the &quot;program&quot; does
more harm than good.

<p>
I could go on and on with my story....but the jist of it is that my father died of
alcoholism while I was in the &quot;program&quot; and we shared &quot;the steps&quot;.....it was really
traumatic (really long story short).

<p>
It did prompt me to do some of my own research on alcoholism. I noticed on your list
of best reads you did not list this book   &quot;7 Weeks to Sobriety&quot;  Personally I found
it to have some of the best REAL information on alcohol addiction out there.

<p>
I also found some stuff relating alcoholism in Indians to low-blood sugar....which I
believe there is some truth to. I can't give you references......it was a long time
ago. I grew up in New Mexico with a high populous of Indians and saw first hand how
it affects Indians. ....I don't know.....maybe I should do more and contribute more
to your crusade. It's been nice just leaving it all in my &quot;history&quot; and not having
to think about it.

<p>
I had a post on facebook bring it back to my consciousness....so I decided to take a
peek at your site and re-hash old frustraded feelings with AA and NA.

<p>
My decision to write though is mostly about that book....it really gives good
information about different types of alcoholism....it is a good read....good
information. I even concidered contacting her and starting a treatment facility with
her ......then I decided I just wanted to move forward.....and leave it all behind.
That is why I especiallly commend you for your efforts!!

Hello Carmel,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
I will definitely have to check out
<i>7 Weeks to Sobriety</i>.
Somehow, I think I've heard of it before but never got around to reading it.
<p>
Ah, New Mexico. I spent over 20 years there, 1969 to 1992.
 I still feel like a recent transplant to Oregon.

Have a good day now.
