From:  	&quot;Adam C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	I would like your opinion, 12 step programs are literally ruining my life<br>

<p>
First and foremost I want to begin by saying that my appreciation of you is
enormous.  You've spent a lot of time and effort to construct a place that can be
a honest and realistic  forum for ideas on 12 step programming.  I would have no
hope had I not found your facts and arguments.

<p>
A little background,
I'm a 22 year old senior at the University of Michigan, and over the past
several years I developed a problem in my decision making compacted with some
major life circumstances that lead to less than favorable outcomes in my life.
I will be the first person to say that I developed a problem that needed
attention. Late last year I was presented a semi intervention by my family who
I am incredebally close to and the offer to go to a rehabilitation clinic.  It
wasn't so much that I was ever physiologically addicted to anything, but I
began to like the numbing the pain from an unfortunate series of events in my
life at that time.  I was told by a close family member at the intervention
event to go into it with an open mind as I know that my behvior was not healthy
in the long run and I needed to arrest the situation.  And so began my descent
into the living hell of the world of 12 steps.

<p>
I expected to go to inpatient rehab that was described as &quot;intensive&quot; and
learn a lot of good helpful information about addiction itself and actual
things I could do proactively to help phase it out of my life. I expected
alot of practical application based psychology and a good amount of
individual therapy to probe why i was using (instead I was told that did not
matter, to just follow the program) I thought it be good to get away clear
my head and focus on the shit I needed to take care of.  Right away I
started picking out the discrepencies starting with the disease model of
addiction.  Imagine my suprise when I spent 95% of my therapy time
discussing information that was beaten to death on the first day.  A barage
of 12 step jargon and ideology.  Even more shocking to me was the treatment
of those who spoke out or questioned the ideas presented in the very least.

<p>
I found myself thinking negative things about the very necessary recovery  process
because of the manor of therapy I was receiving.  Totally questioning how anybody
could get paid at all for this. My rehab program was so heavily focused on pure 12
steppism that only fleeting references were made to biological information or
phychological concepts.  I finally made it out of the constantly recycled hell of
rehab.
<p>
  I am very lucky to have a family that is very supportive of me and my
recovery process.  Unfortunately that meant they were attending family lectures
 bi-weekly at the rehab about how to treat a 12 stepper, as well as al-anon meetings.
This is what really pissed me off.   In their worried about me mind state that
bite on whatever they were thrown, as they were so desperate to do anything to
make sure I was in the best shape possible.   They were taken  advantage of in a
desperate time in their lives.
<p>
  It was at this point where I began to
suspect that the 12 steps and intervention concept might be evil in more ways than
you discuss.  They will literally tear apart families.  I remember walking into
their nar-anon meeting after my NA meeting and hearing a seasoned nar-anon vet
encourage my family to distance themselves from me if I did not embrace<br>
<ul>
<li> a. My outpatient rehab which is 3 hours 3 times weekly of more 12 step drivel.
(which I would have a lot more patience for and willingness to focus on if it was
HELPFUL and not complete bullshit.)<br>
<li> b. Outside AA/NA meetings telling them &quot;He'll fail if he doesn't do 90 in 90.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
These people are seriously encouraging estrangement of me from my family if we don't
both involve ourselves in the 12 steps.   I will  say besides maybe Bush stealing
the 04 election that this &quot;quack medicine&quot; pullover and how they trick
addicts/alcoholics,  families, courts and insurance companies into believing they're
actually being treated may be the greatest scam in recent history, preying on people
in such weak emotional states... how very very sad.

<p>
Anyways thanks again for all the stimulating facts and info, you're definitely
bookmarked on my comp.

Hello Adam,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties that you are going
through.  There sure is a lot of A.A. wrecking families going on, isn't there?
I just answered two more letters about A.A. messing up family relationships,
<a href="orange-letters159.html#relations1" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters159.html#relations2" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
For the cultists to tell your family to abandon and ostracize you
is despicable. Your family started off by being concerned about your health and
welfare, and they went to Stepper meetings in hopes that it would help you,
 and now the cultists have twisted it into, &quot;Abandon him and save yourselves
from codependency.&quot;

<p>
Then of course they will rationalize it by adding, &quot;It's for his own good, of course.&quot;
<p>
Despicable.
<p>
And yes, it is probably is one of the greatest scams in recent history.
Even the Wall Street bailout/ripoff is getting some competition from the
&quot;12-Step treatment&quot; scam.  The Wall Street criminals netted hundreds of billions
of dollars from their schemes and fraud.
 Well, the New York Times recently reported that drug and alcohol
rehab was a $20 billion per year industry. Since A.A. has been in existence
for 70 years, that is a lot of years of raking in lots of billions.
In the last 20 years, they might have raked in $300 or $400 billion or so,
and much more in the years before that.
That rivals the recent Wall Street thefts.
<p>
And all of that comes from selling old cult religion and quackery that does
not actually work, while running a gigantic publicity machine to tell the
public that it works great &#8212; &quot;millions saved&quot;. Unreal.
Yes, that's a major scam and a major crime.
<p>
Now, what to do? Well, for starters, if your family is still capable of thinking
rationally, you could direct them to a couple of web pages like<br>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-secrets.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Secrets of A.A.</a>
and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>
and
<li> <a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>
and
<li> <a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Lies of A.A.</a>
</ol>
That should give them plenty to think about.

<p>
Good luck now. Take care of your health and your mind.
<p>
And have a good day.

<a href="orange-gulags.html#Sembler" target="_blank">Melvin Sembler</a>,
who once enabled &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; of American teens
</h2></center>

<p>
By Joe Conason

<p>
Feb. 10, 2010 

<p>
The arrest of an Army sergeant (and Iraq veteran) who allegedly waterboarded his
4-year-old daughter for failing to recite the alphabet is sickening. Yet it may be
the kind of news we must come to expect if, as a society, the United States
determines that torture is an acceptable method of securing information and inducing
obedience. Physical abuse of children is nothing new, of course,  in certain
right-wing quarters, as Max Blumenthal reminded us by exposing the pedagogical
sadism of Focus on the Family in Republican Gomorrah.

<p>
For a sergeant who tortures his child, however, the relevant model probably comes
from somewhere high in the chain of command. At the center of today&#8217;s propaganda
promoting the torture state are former Vice President Dick Cheney, his family and
many of his friends, working through an organization called Keeping America Safe
that is run by his daughter Liz Cheney. The financier behind that outfit is one
Melvin Sembler, a curious character whose r&eacute;sum&eacute; indicates that he is all too
familiar with the &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; of children.

<p>
Sembler is best known as a Florida shopping center magnate and Republican fundraiser
whose success in amassing funds for the Bush family won him two ambassadorial
appointments. Such patronage is a sordid aspect of national politics, but seems
trivial when compared with the truly dark side of Sembler&#8217;s biography. Long before
he achieved prominence in national politics, he was the driving force in the &quot;boot
camp&quot; movement that popularized the use of psychological and physical abuse of
&quot;troubled&quot; children and teenagers.

<p>
His own creation was a federally funded outfit known as Straight, Inc., which
eventually fell apart amid multiple lawsuits and accusations of torture by teenagers
abused in its secretive facilities.

<p>
The  best reporting on Straight&#8217;s frightening history in recent years has appeared
in <i>Reason</i>, the libertarian magazine, under the byline of Maia Szalavitz. Some of the
techniques that eventually brought Sembler&#8217;s organization to the attention of law
enforcement authorities will be eerily familiar to anyone who remembers what
happened at Abu Ghraib:  humiliating punishments, broken bones, starvation, sleep
deprivation, stress positions, verbal assaults, eight-hour sessions of questioning,
and so on.

<p>
According to Szalavitz, &quot;Straight&#8217;s national clinical director ... admitted to
authorities in 1982 that he had kept teenagers awake for 72-hour periods, put them
on peanut butter-only diets, and forced them to crawl through each other&#8217;s legs to
be hit in a 'spanking machine' ...  Straight ultimately paid out millions of dollars
in dozens of lawsuits related to abuse and even kidnapping and false imprisonment of
adults.&quot;

<p>
Eventually Straight  crumbled amid those multimillion-dollar settlements,  newspaper
expos&eacute;s and government probes, thanks to the activism of Richard Bradbury, a young
man whose experience resembles the stories of innocent Iraqis who were caught up in
the torture machine over there.

<p>
Again according to Szalavitz, Bradbury &quot;was forcibly enrolled in the program in
1983, when he was 17. His sister had had a drug problem, and Straight demanded that
he be screened for one as well. After an eight-hour interrogation in a tiny room,
Bradbury, who was not an addict, was nonetheless held. He later described beatings
and continuous verbal assaults, which for him centered on sexual abuse he&#8217;d suffered
as a young boy. Staffers and other participants called him a 'faggot,' told him he'd
led his abusers on, and forced him to admit 'his part' in the abuse.&quot;

<p>
Of course Sembler, like his pal Cheney, will never admit that anything went wrong
with his grisly enterprise. When last heard from, as ambassador to Italy, he still
listed his affiliation with Straight on his  official State Department profile as a
matter of personal pride. Just another exemplar of Cheney family values.

Subject:  	Agreed!!!!<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
Just left your website.  Excellent.  I've also seen some clips on YouTube on 12 step
programs.

<p>
I left CoDA 1.13.10.  My therapist didn't like it at all.  She's been fired!  I've
been trying to get away from the group for the last 7 months.  I met a young
beautiful girl there who quickly seemed to want friendship.
I wasn't comfortable with this given the fact she is 25 and I'm a 52 year old male.
My thinking was
&quot;this is too good to be true&quot;. After a couple of meetings she revealed she had been
physically abused and
sexually assaulted before the age of 8.  Unfortunately the same happened to me.  She
told me I needed a sponsor.  I just blew it off.  No way I'd share that with people
I don't know.  Then again during the Christmas holidays she actually pressured me to
get a sponsor.  I told her I would never share what I shared with her to another
group member.  She gave me a speech on how wonderful Codependents Anonymous is and
trustworthy.  She has been there 17 months.  She has been brainwashed to the point
she thinks she can't survive in the world without her sponsor and meetings.
<p>
  Don't
mean to rant...but thanks for your website.  Glad I can think for myself.  I've also
found out I'm not Codependent.  All of these therapist who send every client that
walks through door to be narcissized by CoDA should lose their license.  Job
security for the therapist if she can keep the client confused and depressed.

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Mike

Hello Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I'm glad to hear that you have your head screwed on straight.
<p>
<a name="codependency"> </a>
Funny that you should mention codependency. That has been on my mind again, too.
I just bought another couple of books on codependency at Goodwill, and now I have to
read and review the things.
(I hate to spend good money on bad books, but I have to <i>Know Thine Enemy</i>.)
I can already tell you that those books are pure horseshit.

<p>
You are right, you don't have codependency. There is no such thing as codependency.
It is a myth and a hoax and a fraud. And yes, you are right, all counselors who diagnose
the patients as &quot;codependent&quot; and send them to CODA should lose their licenses to practice.

<p>
Now there is such a thing as PTSD &#8212; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder &#8212; and that can be
caused by things like childhood abuse or seeing your buddies blown to pieces in
unnecessary wars in Vietnam or Iraq.  But there is no codependency.
All that the quacks do, to create the illusion of a &quot;codependency disease&quot;, is steal signs and
symptoms from real disorders like PTSD.
<p>
In fact, you cannot even get a clear, coherent, concise definition of &quot;codependency&quot;.
There isn't one. Earlier, I spoke about some of
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="_blank">the goofy definitions
 of codependency</a>
in the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">12-Step Snake Oil</a>&quot;.
Now, in one of these new books, we get this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
In an essay in <i>Co-dependency: An Emerging Issue</i>, she [Sharon Wegschneider-Cruse]
has defined co-dependency as &quot;a primary disease and a disease within every member
of an alcoholic family.&quot;
<br>...<br>
Sondra Smalley ... has suggested in her workshops that &quot;co-dependency is a pattern of
learned behaviors, feelings, and beliefs that make life painful.&quot;
<br>...<br>
Robert Subby has defined co-dependence as &quot;an emotional, psychological, and behavioral
condition that develops as a result of an individual's prolonged exposure to, and
practice of, a set of oppressive rules &#8212; rules which prevent the open expression
of feeling as well as the direct discussion of personal and interpersonal problems.&quot;
<br>...<br>
Charles Whitfield ... still links the disease solely to alcohol. It is defined as
&quot;ill health, or maladaptive or problematic behavior that is associated with
living, working, or otherwise being close to a person with alcoholism.&quot;
<br>...<br>
Ernie Larsen ... defined the co-dependent as &quot;anyone who has been <i>affected</i> by
the person who has been <i>afflicted</i> by the disease of chemical dependency.&quot;
He extends his definition to include &quot;anyone who lives in close association over a
prolonged period of time with anyone who has a neurotic personality.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Co-Dependence: Misunderstood&#8212;Mistreated</i>, Anne Wilson Schaef, pages 14&#8212;18.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ooops!!! You rubbed up against an alcoholic. Now you have the disease of codependency
and you need treatment. That will be $10,000 for a 28-day stay at a codependency
clinic, where you will learn to practice the 12 Steps, and list and confess <i>ALL</i> of your sins.
<p>
On the back cover of the book, we get the authoress' definition, which is a bunch of muddled double-talk:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<h2>What is co-dependence?</h2>
Originally a term for the disease that affects people involved in a close relationship
with an alcoholic or a chemically dependent person, co-dependence, Schaef proposes,
is just one form of what she calls &quot;the addictive process,&quot; an underlying, generic,
primary disease whose assumptions, beliefs, and lack of spiritual awareness are openly
supported by the society in which we live.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Co-Dependence: Misunderstood&#8212;Mistreated</i>, Anne Wilson Schaef, back cover.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you lack spiritual awareness because you associated with an alcoholic?
<p>
By the way, that book was published in 1986. It is loaded with phrases like 
&quot;the impact her new theory will have&quot;, &quot;developing the concept&quot;, and
&quot;moving towards broader definitions&quot;,
which imply that &quot;codependency&quot; is a big new discovery, and a new
field of medical treatment. Well, in the following 24 years,
neither the American Medical Association, nor the American Psychiatric Association,
has seen fit to recognize the existence of any such &quot;disease&quot; or &quot;condition&quot; as
&quot;codependency&quot;.  So it wasn't really a new, emerging field after all, was it?
<p>
Oh, but they have an explanation for that, too, sort of...
The authoress declares that
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
I am appalled by the basic ignorance about addictions and co-addictions in the
mental health field. ... we must look carefully at what he [Charles Whitfield] calls the
&quot;untrained&quot; and/or &quot;untreated professional&quot; &#8212;
 professionals who are not themselves
aware of the diseases of the addictive process or co-dependence and therefore
are not dealing with it in themselves. He estimates, as I noted in Chapter 1,
that this includes 80% of all helping professionals.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Co-Dependence: Misunderstood&#8212;Mistreated</i>, Anne Wilson Schaef, page 30.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ah, so if a doctor does not believe in &quot;codependency&quot;, then
he is &quot;untrained&quot;, and he has the disease himself?
Why does this sound like a Medieval witchcraft trial?
<p>
<font color="#8F0000">
&quot;If you say that you do not believe in the existence of witches, then that just proves
that you are an evil, lying witch who is trying to hide the practice of witchcraft.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

do have issues with associated with PTSD (anxiety).     But it's definitely non
related to codependency.  I ask the therapist if I should meet the young girl at
CoDA for coffee.  She said absolutely.  The brainwashed beauty was totally different
at Starbucks than at the meetings.  Deranged, fake, narcissist, attention whore to
be blunt.  Not codependent.  I've highlighted some of the points I found
interesting.   Relationships with brainwashed whack jobs outside the meetings...Not
a good idea.

<p>
The meetings don't work.  I saw zero growth.  People blaming the same &quot;family of
origin&quot; for all of their irresponsibilities, bad behavior and stupid decisions.
These are people that have attended meetings 2yrs. plus.
What a facade!!!!

Hi again, Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the update. Somehow, I'm not surprised. Considering that fact that
there is no such disease as Codependency, a CoDA meeting would be a bunch of people
sitting around, complaining about how they suffer from a non-existent disease.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:<br>

<p>
Sunday morning, feb 14, 2010 and I have stumbled across this page while
looking for a book called Bill W. by an writer named Hardigan.  I guess the
book is quite revealing about Bill Wilson life and struggles with depression
and womanizing?
<p>
 Anyway, I have read some of the content here and found it
quite interesting, if not rather extensive. I am curious to see when it was
put together and for what reason ?  no judgment here. I have had exposure to
AA for about 10 years and have found it both beneficial and disagreeable at
times..but never thought it cultish!
<p>
 I do like some of the points made in
the content.&quot;by god we have the only cure for alcoholism and you better get
it fast or die&quot; , I still see that attitude in some of the meetings I
attend. I myself struggle with the concept that I am powerless over alcohol.
I agree that my life seems better if I don't drink, but I am not one to go
over the edge on black out benders when I do drink, so I don't think in my
heart I can say I'm powerless over alcohol.
<p>
 Anyway, I'm curious to see if I
hear any feed back here from this site, otherwise I guess I'll keep on
reading the contents of this page.

Subject:  	The Twelve Steps Paper<br>

<p>
Hello,
<p>
Is it possible to get a reprint of your paper? I am involved with a
sober living organisation as a volunteer. I do not understand why so
much energy goes into the 12 step meetings and theories. I don't see
all the so-called success stories the proponents claim. Indeed, it
seems as though the most rabid supporters are the quickest to relapse.
<p>
Also, if you would be kind enough to direct me to additional research
and work in this area, I would be most grateful. Is there any research
that shows that there is any benefit to having addicts surrounded and
counseled by other addicts? Somehow I suspect that one becomes most
like what one is exposed to.
<p>
I also cannot seem to find out why so much of the court system is tied
into this unsupported &quot;therapy.&quot; Is this true all over the United
States?
<p>
Thanks you kindly for any help you can offer.
<p>
All kindness,<br>
K. F.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello K. F.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Well, starting at the top:

<ol>
<li>
There is no dead-tree edition of the web site.
You can download the entire book/web site by downloading a set of zipfiles.
The files are listed on the first menu page,
<a href="menu1.html#archives" target="_blank">here</a>,
and the process for making a CD of the web site is described
<a href="orange-letters29.html#make_CD" target="_blank">here</a>.


<p><li>
For additional research, see the bibliography,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
There is no research that shows that A.A. works, or getting alcoholics or addicts together
in A.A. or N.A. meetings actually reduces alcohol abuse or drug abuse. What the
properly-conducted tests have shown is that A.A. <i>increases</i> binge drinking and
deaths.

<p>
Likewise, a test at Johns Hopkins University showed that addicts getting sponsors did not help either.
<p>
See the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>
for the list of all of the research.

<p>
Watch out: there is a lot of faked research, created by 12-Step shills and promoters,
that purports to show that A.A. works, but it is all fraud.
Here are some examples:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">Keith Humphries' and Rudolf Moos' propaganda</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters31.html#Moos3" target="_blank">another one of Rudolf Moos' fake studies</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters30.html#unscientific" target="_blank">a collection of fake 12-Step studies</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters90.html#summary" target="_blank">four fake studies</a>
<li> <a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>Spirituality: The key to recovery from alcoholism</i></a><br>

<li> <a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">More A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</i></a>
</ul>

<p><li>
The court system is tied into the 12-Step cult because A.A. has been promoting the
use of A.A. as cheap day prisons for 70 years now. The courts can dispose of their
drunkard and drug addict cases easily, and A.A. doesn't cost the courts anything,
and A.A. gets potential recruits out of it.
</ol>
<p>
Have a good day.

<li> <a href="orange-letters146.html#Nichiren" target="_blank">and here</a>
</ol> 

<p>
First off, you used the propaganda trick of
 &quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#exchange_term">Exchange A Term</a>&quot;
when you said that you wanted to &quot;answer some questions&quot; that I posted.
I did not post any &quot;questions&quot; about Nichiren Shoshu &quot;Buddhism&quot;;
I said that in my experience Nichiren Shoshu &quot;Buddhism&quot; was
just another cult. That was not a question at all. My experiences were quite clear.
No doubt about it.
<p>
Then, that page you referred me to has a big title in the middle,
 &quot;Why The Soka Gakkai is Attacked&quot;.
That is not a question for me, either. It is very obvious: It is insane to imagine that you
can get all of your wishes granted by chanting <i>Nam-myoho-renge-kyo</i>
at a printed scroll.  So of course the cult will receive criticism. And rightly so.

<p>
In fact, what I saw people doing at Nichiren Shoshu basically qualifies as
&quot;black magic&quot; &#8212; the attempt to use spiritual forces and
magical powers and chanting to get material gain like money, a better job,
a better apartment, new furniture, a new car...
<p>
By the way, what I saw at Nichiren Shoshu was not Buddhism. It was not even vaguely like Buddhism.
Buddhism is a good thing.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear Orange:

<p>
I found your web site to be the funniest thing I have seen in a while.  To think
that someone is so threatened by AA that they would waste what appears to be
considerable time and expense to attack them is beyond idiocy.
<p>
  What has AA done to
you personally?  And does the fact that several million people have used the flawed
program and believe it saved their life mean nothing to you?
<p>
  Get a life, and leave
grown folks alone.  Your twisted view of AA does not have the least effect on the
sobriety of those who have found it helpful.  If you did not, that is fine.  But
trashing a universally recognized fellowship that has helped so many people is just
petty.  Anyone can find fault with any organization or group of people.  Because
they are, after all, just human.

<p>
And your big alternative to AA?  Like Nancy Reagan, you say &quot;Just Say No&quot;.  That
shows a fairly simplistic and medically irresponsible point of view &#8212; it didn't work
when Nancy said it, and it ain't working now.

Hello Steve,
<p>
Well, your letter is a load of misstatements.
<p>
<ol>
<li> First off, I don't feel &quot;threatened&quot; by Alcoholics Anonymous. I am not afraid
of quack medicine and its practitioners.

<p>
<li>
Alcoholics Anonymous has hurt friends of mine.
You can read about my personal experiences with A.A.
<a href="orange-letters160.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
<li>
Alcoholics Anonymous has not saved several million people. That is one of the standard
<i>Big Lies</i> of A.A.
The actual success rate of A.A. in causing alcoholics to sober up is approximately zero,
or even less. That is, A.A. causes alcoholics to die in greater numbers.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Here is the evidence</a>.

<p>
<li>
The fact that some people &quot;believe it saved their life&quot; only proves that some people
are gullible &#8212; they can be fooled by quackery and cult religion.

<p>
<li>
You say,
<font color="black">
&quot;leave grown folks alone.&quot;
</font>
There is nothing grown-up about promoting quackery and cult religion
as a cure for substance abuse problems.

<p>
<li>
A.A. is not &quot;a universally recognized fellowship&quot;. That is just another grandiose
A.A. <i>Big Lie</i>, just some more of the A.A. self-congratulatory propaganda.
<p>
<li>
I do not recommend Nancy Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot;.
I recommend things like SMART and AVRT.
The list of things that work better than A.A. is
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="_blank">here</a>.
</ol>

<p>
By the way,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#laugh" target="_blank">laughing is a common defense mechanism</a>.
When people encounter information that they feel threatens their cherished illusions,
some people immediately laugh, rather than
seriously consider the information. You say that you are laughing at what I have written, but
you sound angry.  I don't think you are really laughing.

&quot;Thank you for your excellent website that tells the truth about AA. Before I told
my (now) ex-fiance about all the scientific evidence you discuss on your website
showing that AA does not work (much of which I have independently verified &#8212; for
example, I bought a copy of Vaillant's book &quot;The Natural History of Alcoholism&quot;), he
had spent 10 years in AA and thought he was going crazy because he could not stay
sober in &quot;the rooms.&quot;

<p>
Thank you, thank you!  (BTW, the letters section could be one of the fastest ways
for some people to find answers to their questions since you link to the answers
when you reply.   Plus, it shows how &quot;rabid&quot; AAers are about their AA religion.)&quot;

<p>
Hello my Name is Nils S. frm Heidelberg Germany. For me its very
important to say you what i got find out. So i belive now that the AA NA
and what else is working together with FreeMasonic over the hole World.
I think that aa and all other anonymous Groups are a sellected
instituions for the idiologie and relligion of the Freemansonic.
Mansonics used these Groups to get the people in their idiologie, and so
they will sellected all people around the world to built a worldunity in
thougts and relligion of Mansonic.
<p>
Second i think that they want to eliminate Christians silent, and the
doing this with infiltration in Church Groups and other political and
humanit&auml;re Organisations.

<p>
I belive in Jesus Christ and noone as God will rule us. I stay for Love
from god as the simple and peacefullest way for Humanity.

Hello Nils,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I've received questions about a connection between the Freemasons
and A.A., or between the Freemasons and Frank Buchman, every so often,
but
I have found no evidence of such a connection, other than the fact that
<a href="orange-letters136.html#Mason" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith was a Mason</a>.
But if you find any evidence, I'd like to see it.

<p>
Have a good day now.

*Subject:  * 	AA &amp; Addiction<br>
*From:  * 	&quot;Sober Me&quot; <br>
<p>
Good Morning Mr. Orange,

<p>
I have been a depressed withdrawn drink'n doper since age 12. Your personnel story
reveals some of mine. At age 50 suicide ideation was overwhelming. I could not
abandon my daughter as I was abandoned.

<p>
I entered medical detox and &quot;sober living&quot; program for about 30 days. AA was the
mode of treatment.

<p>
Having been absolutely lost and feeling helpless in a dark abyss full of fear I felt
I had nowhere else to go.

<p>
I am an Atheist raised that way 3rd generation from mom's family. Dad a catholic.

<p>
Well I don't need to go into a lot of explaining.   AA just bent my brain, but no
matter what I have not taken one drink in 1 year.

<p>
AA's book and teaching's pretty much go against all I believe about humans. I cannot,
 but have nearly had a drink over admitting I was/is/am powerless. I will not give
my will and my life over to the care of god or any higher power {sounds like
slavery).

<p>
My lack of self worth and fear keeps me at AA. There is lots about it I don't like
and find unhealthy. I do have one year of sobriety and I want to continue a healthy
life. Unfortunately I do not have a healthy family and I have problems with trust
and fear related to early childhood mental, physical and sexual abuse. I have had
many, about 30 years of therapy and 3 hospitalizations. I am determined to live I
believe in the goodness of humans (most of the time) But most of all I want to be a
good Mom and paint in the forest one day. I am wanting to break away from AA, But I
am not sure how. I will follow my instinct, which I believe to be good. AA is kinda
like a rip tide I am trying swimming out of.

<p>
I thank you for your website it gives me hope and faith in myself that I am on the
right track. I am not much of a computer person. I wish I could talk to someone with
your type of strength, intelligence and thinking. I will continue to read your
letters, papers and stories to bolster mine. I have tried SOS and WFS, I am looking
for groups of people likeness of us who are learning and yearning to live  a healthy
life with similar stories.

<p>
Thank you again~ sober Me<br>
P.S. The ducks are adorable

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sober Me,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on your year of sobriety. I'm glad to hear
that you are doing well and feeling better.
<p>
Alas, you can't talk to me on the phone right now because I don't have a phone. I'm still
in the process of getting moved into my new place and haven't figured out how I'm
going to handle phone and Internet access this time. The one thing that I'm sure of
is that I won't again give any more money to rip-off outfits like Qwest or T-mobile.
<p>
Now, about getting out of A.A.:

<ol>

<p><li>
You wrote:
<font color="black">
&quot;My lack of self worth and fear keeps me at AA.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Yes, that is how cults keep people trapped in the cult &#8212; most all cults in general.
Cults deliberately induce feelings of worthlessness, guilt, covert fear, and powerlessness
in their victims, and induce phobias about leaving the cult.
<p>
Look at these Cult Test items that describe exactly what you are experiencing:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency</i>:<br>
<a href="orange-cult_q4.html#cq_powerlessness" target="_blank">the question here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">the answer for A.A. here</a>
<p>
<li> Phobia induction,<br>
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank">the question here</a>, and
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">the answer for A.A. here</a>.
</ul>

<p><li> Now, how to get out? I strongly recommend weaning yourself off of the A.A. routine
moderately, slowly.  Don't just burn all of your bridges behind you, and make a sudden
break of it, or you are likely to feel alone and isolated. Loneliness is one of the
biggest problems that people have when leaving a cult. They suddenly feel like they
have no family or group of friends any more because they are not surrounded by all
of those people who are pretending to be their friends.  So start working on getting
new friends and acquaintances who have nothing to do with either alcoholism or Alcoholics
Anonymous.
<p>
And start doing other things than going to A.A. meetings. You will discover that the sky
doesn't fall if you do something pleasant and constructive, rather than go to another
A.A. meeting.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Frase" target="_blank">Here is a previous letter</a>
where I talked about weaning oneself off of A.A.
</ol>

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

From:  	&quot;Fran C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	hi<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
interesting stuff you've written.  volumes of it by the looks.....
as i keep linking on and on through your materials.
<p>
is there a comprehensive list of your works and web addresses for them?

<p>
oh, another question i have is.....
<br>
what prompted you to devote so much time and energy to this endeavor (and
the subtext of that question is:  what was your experience with AA that gave
you this impetus)?
<p>
Really and truly very interesting stuff and i've already printed hundreds
and hundreds of pages to pdf files.....and i suspect i'm not even close to
the end of what you've written.

<p>
I know that my questions are personal, but I truly am interested.....   I
just finished a book named &quot;How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me&quot;.  A great
book really but it is more about a woman's alternate choices and her
personal path of recovery from addictions and less about her observations of
AA and how it didn't work for her.

<p>
So, currently I just happened upon your website when I was looking for a
searchable big book.

<p>
One thing that I think you really hit on is the contradictions both within
the aa program and within the voluminous writings of bill wilson.

<p>
Last and final question.......<br>
Have you published any of this stuff in hard copy and/or is there a way I
can download pdf files of all of your works so that I can access it in a
less haphazard manner than clicking on links within the text of your
documents.

<p>
Darn one more question &#8212; just curious if you are  male or female.

<p>
Thanks for your time,
Fran C.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Fran,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Those questions are pretty easy to answer, and I don't
mind if they are personal.
<p>
First off, the list of questions and answers for &quot;Who are you?&quot; and &quot;Why did you do
the web site?&quot; are
<a href="orange-letters136.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
The &quot;comprehensive list&quot; of my published writings is super-simple, and you already
found it: the Orange Papers web site. That's it. No dead-tree publications.
<p>
You can download the entire web site by downloading a set of zipfiles.
The files are listed on the first menu page,
<a href="menu1.html#archives" target="_blank">here</a>,
and the process for making a CD of the web site is described
<a href="orange-letters29.html#make_CD" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
You can use the search engine at the bottom of each web page to find items,
and then use the web browser's built-in search function (like slash, '/'), to
find within the page.

<p>
Yes, I also like
&quot;How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me&quot;, by Marianne Gilliam. I have it
on my
<a href="orange-top10.html#Gilliam" target="_blank">
&quot;Top 10&quot; reading list, here</a>.
<p>
I am a man, and there are some recent pictures of me and my little friends
<a href="orange-letters91.html#goslings" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters96.html#goslings" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters97.html#goslings" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Have a good day.
