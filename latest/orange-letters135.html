Subject:  	Thank You<br>

<p>
Dear Sir,
<p>
Thank You.  The truth hurts, but it still is better than blindly
believing in lies.
<p>
I havent read all of ur article yet (the funny spirituality of Bill
W), but I feel ... enlightened.  Enlightened by truth.  Unfortunately,
this is not the 1st time in my life that I have been duped.
I used to believe very strongly in the spirituality of Sri Chinmoy,
having been introduced to it thru music I listened to (such as
Mahavishnu Orchestra and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Santana" target="newwin17">Carlos Santana</a>).
<p>
Both McLaughlin and Santana had been disciples of Chinmoy, or at
least had Chinmoy as their guru.  Certain articles that I have read
online have totally changed my mind about Chinmoy, such as how he took
advantage (sexually) of some of his female disciples, and did certain
other non-spiritual things.
<p>
So, yes, it really hurts to read what you have written, especially
since I am a recovering addict and have been 'in the program' for almost
19 years.  And it's true, people DO blindly worship Bill W, without
doing any research like you've done.
<p>
I am still trying to stay clean, however it is now on my own.  I
have been interested in Buddhism for quite some time, as well.  One of
the things that I like about Buddhism is that Buddha made it clear that
he was NOT God (altho a lot of people worship him as such).  Buddha was
very logical in that he came up with 4 Noble Truths, and an 8-fold path
for one to live their life by.  Also, Buddha taught quite extensively
about craving (sounds like addiction, doesnt it), and the pain and
suffering caused by it.
<p>
Anyway, I'm not trying to convert you or anyone else here, but I am
very happy on the path I'm on now.  And grateful for at least 2
reasons.
<ul>
<li> One, for people like yourself, who are willing to take a
potentially VERY unpopular stand, in order to weed fact from fiction.
<p>
<li> And Two, for the fact that I was openminded enough to actually listen
and learn from you, even though it initially was very painful to read
your article.
</ul>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
David R.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi David,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.
I also started off thinking that Alcoholics Anonymous was
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="newwin36">the biggest and best self-help group</a>
in America. It took me a while to learn the truth.
<p>
I'm also very interested in Buddhism. We were just talking about that a few
letters ago,

Subject:  	A debating technique question<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I wat to know if you ever encountered this tactic of debating/arguing?
I've read a good deal of the debating techniques page, but not all of it
so if it's on there and I didn't read it yet I apologize in advance.

<p>
Demand proof of your opponent's position while at the same time
delegitmizing your opponent's  point or the way you answer it before
your opponent makes it.

<p>
It works something like this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Give me ONE valid study that shows the ineffectivness of AA ! &#8212; And
DON'T tell me of the Vaillant Harvard study! It's over 20 years old!
He's more or less disowned it and since then the bulk of scientific data
we have now clearly refutes it!
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously you have to know of the arugment that's coming so you would
have to have encounter it before. You also have to lie (I believe Lie
with qualifiers may be the correct term.)

<p>
I also see people do it in messageboards. When people respond to a
usually particulaly long comment They'll try to refute
each point by quoting every comment in order (the same way you answer
some emails.) The person wanting a response will belittle this technique
and the person doing it beforehand.

<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Are you gonna quote everything I wrote in order and respond to it?
That's so lame and annoying! Why don't you just answer what I wrote
without trying to <b>make it look like your a some type of scholar or
something???</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Or at other times, they do the &quot;I'm fed up&quot; bit.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Don't Give me the &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot; argument. I'm tired of hearing it!
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once again, apologies if it's up on your site already.  : )

<p>
Sherp

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sherp,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And no, it isn't already on the site. I'll have to add that
technique &#8212; actually, those techniques.

<p>
You touched on more than one technique &#8212; three, I think.
<ol>
<li> 
Not only is there
<i>Rejecting The Answer In Advance</i> like you described &#8212; 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;And DON'T tell me of the Vaillant Harvard study!&quot;
</font>
&#8212; and
<li>
<i>Delegitimizing the Rebuttal in Advance</i>, like you also described &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Are you gonna quote everything I wrote in order and respond to it?&quot;</font>
&#8212; 
<li>
but there is also <i>Spurious Delegitimization Of Undesired Evidence</i>.
<p>
It does not matter whether Dr. Vaillant &quot;has disowned&quot; the results of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="newwin20">his research project
at Cambridge Hospital</a>
that he described at length in his first book &#8212; the results
of valid tests are still the results of valid tests. It's like, if I &quot;disown&quot; my previous
statement that I'm a 62-year-old American male, does that suddenly change me into a
dashing young 20-something guy?
(Wouldn't that be a great way to get eternal youth?)
<p>
And I have not heard of Dr. Vaillant ever conducting another controlled study
of Alcoholics Anonymous treatment
that came up with a different result. Being a true believer in Steppism,
Dr. Vaillant is just unhappy with the real facts that he unintentionally revealed &#8212; 
that A.A. did not work to make alcoholics quit drinking, but it did raise
the death rate in alcoholics.
<p>
I can understand how Dr. Vaillant is unhappy with that answer, and wants
to &quot;disown&quot; the results, but that doesn't change the facts.
But it's a great propaganda trick to say,
&quot;Dr. Vaillant has since disowned that study.&quot;

<p>
And the statement that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...since then the bulk of scientific data we have now clearly refutes it!&quot;</font>,
isn't &quot;lying with qualifiers.&quot;
It is just plain old lying. There is no &quot;bulk of scientific data&quot;
that says any such thing.
The bulk of the scientific data says that A.A. does not work.
All of the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin24">valid controlled tests</a>
found A.A. to be a failure, so when a Stepper argues that a bunch of
&quot;studies&quot; showed that A.A. works great, he is merely referring
to some phony propaganda articles that are based on no actual proper tests.
Look
<a href="orange-letters30.html#unscientific" target="newwin22">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters83.html#faked1" target="newwin21">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="newwin23">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters90.html#summary" target="newwin25">here</a>
for four collections of such propaganda.
</ol>

<p>

<p>
First off, WTF don't you have your email address at the bottom or a
contact button.  I only got this address from looking through the other
letters and then wondered how they knew the address in the first place.
Sorry if its somewhere and I'm just missing it but I looked pretty hard.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Zack,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Actually, I have my email address on every page, twice.
At the top of the page, it says, &quot;by A. Orange&quot;, and it's a link to my email
address. Do a mouse-over on it, and see what the status line at the bottom of
the browser says: &quot;mailto:orange@orange-papers.org&quot;
<p>
Likewise, at the bottom of every page, it says:
&quot;Copyright &copy; 2016, A. Orange&quot;, and yes, that's a link to the email address too.
<p>
Still, I suppose I could add a third one, and make it more obvious.

</font>
<p>
Anyways, I wanna try to keep this short. I'm just starting off in AA and
&quot;working the steps&quot; and getting to about the third and starting to feel
disillusioned.  I stumbled onto your site and believe and agree with
what you have to say. I checked out the SMART site and it looks at least
worth my time to look into.

<p>
Perhaps you have answered this question before, in which case it will be
easy for you to direct me to the answer if its on your page, but how do
you account for there seeming to be no current MOTIVE for AA to be a
cult. The founders are all dead so there is no personal glory. They
don't sell you anything and the donations are pretty meager I doubt they
cover much more than cost.  So money, power or prestige are out (i
think).  Whats left?  Momentum?  If AA is a cult as you say then what is
the point of the cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes, good question. The founders are dead, so they are not benefitting
from the cult any more, but other people are.
We have discussed this before. A.A. is different things to different people.
Everyone who stays in A.A., or who promotes A.A., or who sells A.A., or who leads
A.A., gets something out of it. See these letters:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters107.html#why_cult" target="newwin19">What do you suppose is the motivation for
this organisation?</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters40.html#LauriJean" target="newwin17">AA isn't a profit-making organization... of what value is it to continue propagating itself?</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters3.html#why_cult" target="newwin18">Why people stay in cults</a>
</ul>


</font>
<p>
LIke i said, I am recently in the program but I do hear people regularly
talk about their definition of god and or how they worked the steps as
an agnostic and there is not really any derision as far as I can tell.
Yeah some people are obviously ardent about a more standard biblical
definition and certain &quot;AA nazi's&quot; i think don't like it when others
talk about how they came about it, but I don't even see what the point
would be for sustaining itself if its not even doing the only other
thing possible which is conversion to religion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, religious conversion is one of the goals of A.A., even as they deny it.
But there are also other goals. If they can't convert you, maybe they can
still get you to keep them company and listen to their drunkalogues...

Sender:  	william N.<br>
Subject:  	Recalling an old story<br>

<p>
Hi Terrance,

<p>
I haven't really given you much about my story &#8212; just little tidbits
here and there. But here's a little anecdote:

<p>
Out of the blue the other night I recalled an incident that occurred
when I was at my second rehab in New Jersey where back in 1995. The
rehab was of the 28-day, AA farm-league variety. In other words, my
insurance company paid them a whole lot of money just so they could
simply shove the 12-steps down my throat.

<p>
The rehab was in Northern New Jersey, situated on old farmstead. The
entire population of the place was only maybe 10 or 15. After I was
there for about 3 weeks, and after buying the whole song and dance about
AA and rigorous honesty and soul searching and stuff, the director of
the place called us into the cafeteria for an abrupt meeting.

<p>
&quot;Folks&quot; he began gravely, &quot;we have the opportunity to treat and save the
life of a very important person. He has been struggling with this
disease for several years and now it's time for us to act!&quot;
<p>
Well, that
very important person happened to be Lawrence Taylor, the all-world
linebacker for the New York football Giants. His public problems had
been legion and everyone at the rehab had heard he might be coming. Now
it seemed a <i>fait accompli</i>. But wait a minute...

<p>
&quot;I know some of you know who I'm talking about&quot; he continued, &quot;and I
want you to know that if you think his attendance might in any way
hinder your recovery efforts, please, <i>please</i> feel free to let me know.<br>
&quot;So if there is anyone here who objects to having this person here,
please raise your hand.&quot;
<p>
We began looking around at each other. There
was an air of excitement a famous person might become <i>one of us!</i> Heck,
he could play volleyball with us during our daily game!  Not one hand
in the air &#8212; except for mine.

<p>
I slowly raised my hand. The director looked at me in shock. He shot an
angry look over at my counselor in disbelief, who shrugged his
shoulders, mystified. &quot;I think having this person here,&quot; I began &quot;would
be a huge distraction for all of us. I don't think we would be able to
concentrate on our sobriety. I know I personally would have a difficult
time doing what I have to do...&quot;

<p>
Stunned silence. The director and the counselors then proceeded to
publicly harangue me in front of the rest of the community, &quot;Nonsense!
He's the same as you &#8212; a drug addict and alcoholic&quot; they raved. &quot;Do you
think you're <i>better</i> than any other alcoholic?&quot; And then this gambit,
&quot;In fact, <i>YOU</i> could help <i>HIM.</i>&quot;

<p>
Anyway they weren't going to let little ol' me stand in the way of them
getting a big-time celebrity. The whole deal of asking our opinion was a
complete charade &#8212; a farce. I got a real confused feeling about this.
They were beseeching us to do one thing while they did another. It was
complete and absolute hypocrisy and duplicity. I should've known this
was just typical of the whole 12-step recovery business.

<p>
The memory still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. They didn't give two
shits about my life. By the way, once LT got there we never saw him. He
was kept in a &quot;private cottage&quot; with a phone, TV, and special meals. He
didn't have to mix with us nor did he have to bother with doing any of
that boring step-work stuff like we did. He was looking for a little
vacation and this place gave it to him. I don't blame him at all.

<p>
By the way, the name of the rehab? Honesty House.

Hey Orange,

<p>
Thank you for maintaining an excellent site that I often visit as a part
of my ongoing battle with addiction.  I wanted to let you know that I
had an experience with the &quot;recovery&quot; community that is 100% committed
to AA (at least in their treatment methods).  After many difficult
discussions where I battled circular logic and group think, I was able
to at least get some treatment professionals here in AA's birthplace to
concede that it's not the only treatment option and that cognitive
approaches do work.  It is so unfortunate to see AA's grip on treatment
centers as they present a 12-step option as the only hope for someone to
beat addiction.  It amazes me that the medical community has such a
narrow focus with addiction while the rest of their colleagues are
working on other health issues with a multi pronged approach.  Jack
Trimpey also raises a great point over at Rational Recovery with the
conflict of interest for counselors who are members of AA and are also
insisting their patients follow the same path.  I think the sooner the
treatment industry realizes this paradox the better off patients will be
who are seeking results and not wasted time, money, and in worst case
scenarios a slide into a black hole they never get out of.

<p>
Keep up the good work and I look forward to seeing future posts on the
website.

I've just come across your website -fantastic!!! I am a UK journalist,
currently living in LA, and writing a book about giving up drinking.
AA was disastrous for me, Alan Carr's book, fantastic, Deepak Chopra
great, Eckhart wossisname far less so (way too many words!).
<p>
I was
fascinated by your references to &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;, as that is
what I feel has happened to me, having taken on board a bit from so
many different places and reached the point of saying: that's it.
Over. Decision made. Now on with the rest of my life.
<p>
My book, <i>The Beginner's Guide to Sobriety</i>, is therefore not a struggle
that results in my finding God, AA, etc. But I find a power within
myself (some would say it comes from elsewhere; if I have to say it
connects me to anything, I would say nature/the universe) that has
really changed the way I live &#8212; not just the way I respond to drink.
For me, drink was a manifestation of other toxins (emotional,
largely), and dealing with those things rather than the symptom (ie
drink) has been my cure.
<p>
I have never wanted a drink so much as when I walked out of AA! I did
hear one thing, though, when someone said: We've had all the fun we're
going to have from alcohol&quot;. I know that I have, but what I really
want to get across in my book is that there are SO MANY different ways
that people can face their alcohol problems and get through them
without resorting to AA, which so many believe is the only thing
available to them.
<p>
The one thing I AM stressing, though (and i changed during the writing
of the book on this score), is that the &quot;occasional drinking&quot; stuff
doesn't work. You may be able to stay sober physically with the
occasional drink, but it's still keeping the &quot;monster&quot; alive mentally,
emotionally and spiritually (and I don't mean the latter in a God way!).
<p>
Anyway, thank you for your amazing site; I have only just started
exploring it, and it is just great.
<p>
Best wishes,<br>

Hi Jaci,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the compliments.
And your book sounds interesting; you make a bunch of good points.
<p>
<a name="moderate"> </a>
Starting at the end, I have to comment that <i>some</i> people can drink moderately,
and some cannot. I am one of those who cannot. But the Rand Corporation produced
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="newwin26">a milestone report</a>
that found that about 50% of the alcoholics who stop their self-destructive drinking
do it by tapering off into moderate,
controlled, drinking, and the other 50% get sober by absolute abstinence.
<p>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS" target="newwin26">Dr. Kenneth Blum</a>,
who discovered one of the genes that modulate the risk for
alcoholism, commented that he believed that genetic alcoholics had to completely
abstain from drinking.
<p>
I believe that, because I'm a genetic alcoholic, who got it from his father,
who got it from his mother,
and total abstinence is the only thing that ever worked for me.
I can stay sober for years (8.75 years now), but I cannot moderate for a month.
Moderation never worked; it didn't stay moderate.

<p>
About &quot;keeping the monster alive&quot;, oh, do I know that one.  I became convinced
that I could never drink moderately when I had about 7 or 8 months of sobriety, and was
reading a book about alcoholism. When I got to the part about &quot;controlled drinking&quot;,
and was considering what the author was writing about how recovered alcoholics
can learn to do moderate, controlled, drinking,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin28">the little monster</a>
was actually waking up and singing and dancing. I could hear
the Democratic Party theme song &quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot; playing in my head.
I was actually getting such a strong reaction to the thought of a return to
drinking that the craving center was getting excited. I was amazed at the reaction that
I was watching, and noticed that all that the little monster heard was &quot;return to
drinking&quot;, and that the word &quot;controlled&quot; was ignored.

<p>
I came to the conclusion that if I was getting such an extreme reaction
to just the thought of a return to (moderate, controlled) drinking, that
it was better to not feed the monster.
<p>
Still, I get
<a href="orange-letters126.html#Nicholas">the occasional letter</a>
from someone who has recovered in a way where he
is able to do moderate, controlled drinking, and live a pretty normal life.
More power to them, but that's not for me.

<p>
I feel that I'm also a case of &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;. Basically, I just got sick
and tired of being sick and tired. And I also got tired of the poverty, and nothing ever
working out right, and the not feeling good about myself, and just the whole mess.
So I was receptive to the message when a doctor told me that I had to quit drinking &#8212; 
&quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot; was how he put it.
I thought it over for a month, and then I chose to live.
<p>
It's dangerous to over-generalize, but I feel like that is the story of a whole lot
of people who do just finally quit drinking one day.
<p>
I also agree with the line about, &quot;We've already had all of the fun
that we are going to have with alcohol.&quot; That was one of the big
problems with alcohol in the end &#8212; it just wasn't fun any more.
Too much sickness, too much pain, not much fun. The party was over.
<p>
But that's alright, because the end of alcohol isn't the end of the fun of life.
That's something I try to communicate to people who are about to quit, or
thinking about quitting.
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin28">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>
tries to tell you that you will never have any
more fun, ever again, for the rest of your life,
if you give up alcohol, but that isn't true at all.
The real truth is just the opposite. I'm having a whole lot more fun now than
I was having with alcohol and tobacco, just laying around the house sick
and tired and never going out and having fun.
Now I'm out and about all of the time, every day &#8212; I can't stand
to be cooped up indoors, especially not during a beautiful summer like this.

<p>
So good luck with your book, and have a good day.

Subject:  	hello<br>

<p>
I have been reading the orange papers for several days now and
completely agree with what you are saying. However, I am still very much
in need of something to help me stop drinking. I tried AA, and after
about 4 months started drinking again. I was very bored and lonely, and
the only way I know how to feel better is to drink. I have been looking
at SMART and some other things. I really feel like I need some sort of
structured environment. I have told two therapists about this. One of
them told me the best thing to do was to go to AA. The other one wanted
me to go to an outpatient program, and then once I was done with that,
he wanted me to go to AA. I live in Charlotte, NC. Do you have any advice?

<p>

Hello Townsend,

About something to help you to quit drinking,
I just answered the same question a few days ago, so I'll point you to it
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin38">here</a>.
<p>
Just offhand, I don't know of a good &quot;structured&quot; program in Charlotte, but
that link leads to a bunch of groups who have online forums, where you could ask.
You can get information and advice from hundreds of people.

<p>
I would not bother to go back to a therapist who recommends A.A. as the best thing.
Such a person is lazy and ignorant and has never bothered to learn the facts.
That is inexcusable behavior in a person who is supposed to be a professional
healer. That's like a doctor who never bothered to learn what works best to
treat coronary disease, but who insists on treating heart disease in his patients anyway.

<p>
Have a good day, and take care of yourself.

You really think that alcoholics need to be lied to and misled and deceived?

You believe that lying to alcoholics and deceiving them with

<p>
Well, lying to alcoholics and deceiving them is what Alcoholics
Anonymous has been doing for 70 years now, and that dishonest practice
hasn't produced good results.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin40">A.A. is a failure</a>

and a high suicide rate.
That isn't good. That doesn't help.

<p>
When somebody lies to me, and deceives me, he loses all credibility when I discover
that I've been lied to. I sure won't trust him after that.
Why would anybody trust his life to a group that is deceiving
him and pulling
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="newwin41"><i>bait-and-switch</i> tricks</a>
on him?
<p>
And people are not all so stupid that they won't notice what is going on, after a while.
That is one of the reasons that A.A. has such a high dropout rate.

Subject:  	My conclusions about AA<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I know from reading your site what your real name is, but I guess I
still think of you as Agent Orange.  I wanted to share with you the
latest development in my thinking, because your website has been a
crucial element in shaping this development.  Of course, this may be of
no interest to you, but I wanted to give you the chance to see how your
efforts have influenced me.  Also, if you include this in your letters
pages, it may help others with similar experiences to me.

<p>
I used to have a very rosy view of Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; For a long
time I was blind to its faults, its contradictions, its abuses, and its
dubious history.  I am not now.  In recent years no one has tried harder
than I have <i>myself</i> to convince me that AA is nothing but a big lie &#8212; a
dangerous, brain-washing cult that harms people and destroys lives.  I
have tried to convince myself that I have been the victim of this cult
and that my sole objective is to leave this cult and to recover from the
damage it has caused me.

<p>
After a long period of hammering out this struggle within me, I have
come to the conclusion that, despite the fellowship's deep flaws, there
<i>is</i> something of value in Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; something it would
harm me to deny myself.  The fundamental conclusion I have reached is
that, whether I like it or not, I <i>belong</i> in Alcoholics Anonymous.
This will, of course, reinforce your already firm conviction that AA
<i>is</i> a cult, and that I have simply been unsuccessful in my attempt to
be free of its evil clutches.  But it is true.  This is not something I
can easily explain or define.  When I first went to AA I was not simply
indoctrinated into an alien belief system &#8212; I genuinely experienced a
feeling of homecoming that no cult, no matter how clever and powerful,
would be able to induce in its new &quot;recruits&quot;.

<p>
I have asked myself one simple question: could I have stopped drinking
and stayed sober without AA?  The answer, for me, is no.  I have tried
to convince myself that stopping drinking and attending AA were
coincidental &#8212; I have read the bit on your website about the last place
you look for help getting the credit for something you have done
yourself.  But I cannot believe this is what happened to me.

<p>
I have tried to convince myself that the 12 steps are the religious
precepts of a Nazi-sympathising religious fanatic, reworded for
alcoholics by a small time con-man with messianic delusions.  Perhaps
they <i>are</i>?  But there is more to them &#8212; more than even the flawed and
ridiculous people who first cobbled them together realised or understood.

<p>
When I accept AA, everything locks into place &#8212; it all fits.  I
understand what I am, where I am, who I am, and where I am going.  I
feel that I am part of something greater than myself and such an
understanding brings me great comfort and security.

<p>
When I reject AA then, despite what I try to convince myself, the
reality is that I feel empty, alone, angry, afraid and directionless.

<p>
I want to say something else &#8212; and it will horrify much of your
audience.  Before I contacted AA, before I even knew what AA <i>was</i>, I
belonged.  Ever since I was a child I have drawn and written.  I look
back on my creative output, from childhood, through adolescence and
early adulthood, and I see a clear common theme recurring over and over
again.  That theme is of spiritual recovery from alcoholism.  I won't go
into details here &#8212; this is not the place.  But I can point to stories
and lyrics I have written, as well as drawings and paintings I have
done, that represent the search for spiritual recovery from alcoholism,
through the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.  At a fundamental level, I
<i>knew</i> about AA before I was consciously aware of it.  Therefore, when I
went to my first AA meeting, I <i>recognised</i> AA.  I knew it.  And it knew
me.  This is true whether I accept it or not.

<p>
If you're still reading, I will add more.

<p>
I have been sober now for over seventeen years.  There is much that is
wrong with AA.  In many, many ways it is rotten to the core.  The
literature is, for the most part, the garbled nonsense of people who
have discovered something powerful but have no idea how to handle it or
present it to others.  Meetings are filled with sick people spouting
dangerous nonsense, and most of those people will not remain long in AA,
anyway.  Alcoholics Anonymous has a non-existent &quot;success&quot; rate.
Trusting people in AA is like playing Russian roulette with your safety
and your mental and emotional health &#8212; something I have experienced
first-hand several times.  AA is a deeply flawed organisation that
refuses to look at itself honestly and do something about those flaws
before forcing itself on the rest of the world.

<p>
In the US the criminal justice system and health and social care is
riddled with AA infiltration by covert AA members abusing their
professional influence to force AA on those who don't want it.  This
situation is far less pronounced in the UK, but we are heading in the
same direction.  This is something that needs to be stopped.  Alcoholics
Anonymous and its 12 step program, it has been proven over and over
again, does not lend itself to the professional setting, and should be
kept away from professional people trying to do the jobs for which they
are qualified.

<p>
I do not believe that AA is for everyone &#8212; it is far from the only shop
in town, and does not have the right to pretend otherwise.  The
principle of attraction rather than promotion is a good one that has
been lost.

<p>
I am not blind to these things any more.  But I belong in AA.  Perhaps
such a belonging is only as a relative outsider, whose views are
ridiculed and rejected by the more fundamentalist elements within the
fellowship.  But still belonging, nonetheless.

<p>
In your pages you quote Dr Arthur Cain.  Although in 1963 he criticised
AA, he says that in the 1940s he respected it.  Part of his later
criticism was that the genuine humility and gratitude he observed in
AA's very early members was replaced by something he so accurately
referred to as the &quot;AA smirk&quot;.  This smirk now covers the world &#8212; that
early humility and gratitude is all but gone.  But it is something I
felt myself when I first attended AA.  It does exist.  Can it be
recovered?  Who knows?

<p>
I will continue to read your site and to stay up to date with the
letters pages.  I intend to go directly to the sources you quote to back
up your arguments &#8212; to read them independently of your bias.  That is
not a criticism &#8212; you freely admit to such a bias and have never claimed
to provide a balanced resource.

<p>
I know you won't agree with what I've written but I hope you would
respect it.  At least it will make a change from the usual
slogan-spouting, hate-filled, caps-lock-happy, semi-literate crap that
gets thrown at you by the true believers!

<p>
Stay well.

Hi again, Gary,
<p>
These statements are curious:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;In recent years no one has tried harder
than I have <i>myself</i> to convince me that AA is nothing but a big lie.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


<p>
Likewise,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
I have asked myself one simple question: could I have stopped drinking
and stayed sober without AA?  The answer, for me, is no.  I have tried
to convince myself that stopping drinking and attending AA were
coincidental ...
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Why would you do that when you believe that you belong in A.A.,
and you were born predestined to recover from alcoholism in A.A.,
and that A.A. saved your life? Are you contemplating escape from the cult?

<p>
Your assumption that you could not have quit drinking and stayed sober without A.A. is
groundless.  What if you had quit drinking and moved to Saudi Arabia?
What if you had quit drinking and joined a monastery?
Or quit drinking and became a 7th-Day Adventist or a Mormon?
What would have happened then?
<p>
Or, far less exotic, what if you had just gotten totally fed up with being
so sick and hung-over so much, and finally just quit drinking?
<p>
You cannot really predict alternate futures.
You just don't know what might have happened.

<p>
This line doesn't surprise me. It is actually a very common cult phenomenon:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
Therefore, when I went to my first AA meeting, I recognised AA. I knew it.
And it knew me. This is true whether I accept it or not.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson described it like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;When we reached A.A., and for the first time in our lives stood
among people who seemed to understand, the sense of belonging was
tremendously exciting.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1" color="blue">
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 57.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Cults promote that feeling with love-bombing and lots of code phrases like
&quot;coming home&quot; and &quot;being among our own kind&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Says Dr. Earle: &quot;Our scientific training makes us want to know the
reason for everything. Once you don't have to know the reason for
everything, you're coming home, baby, you're really coming home.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">

in Alcoholics Anonymous say the 12-step program could benefit all
physicians</i>, C. Thomas Anderson,

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="cult_withdrawal"> </a>
Then you wrote:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">

reality is that I feel empty, alone, angry, afraid and directionless.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes. It's called &quot;cult withdrawal&quot;, and it can be very painful.
It's just like withdrawal from any other addicting drug.
That's what keeps lots of people trapped in cults for many years.
<p>
What I would recommend as a remedy for that problem is that you start 
building a life outside of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Deliberately seek out the company of other non-drinking people. Build a social circle
of people whose lives do not revolve around either alcohol or Alcoholics Anonymous.
Get in the habit of going to other kinds of meetings &#8212; like Wednesday is for
one thing, and Thursday is for something else &#8212; things that you like to do
that don't involve alcohol.
Slowly wean yourself off of the A.A. drug.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
...you freely admit to such a bias and have never claimed
to provide a balanced resource.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ah, but I never said that I allowed my personal feelings to cause me
to change or distort the
facts. To have feelings and biases is human; to distort the facts in order to
promote a certain viewpoint is dishonest. I don't cross that line.
I strive to be rigorously honest in reporting the facts, because people
are dying over this stuff.
(And of course you noticed that Bill Wilson and
A.A. were notoriously dishonest about the facts like 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="newwin40">the A.A. success rate</a>,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html" target="newwin48">A.A. history</a>,
and 
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="newwin45">A.A. finances</a>.)

<p>
Please do go back to the original source documents. That's what I did. I don't
trust other people to quote accurately or completely either.
I want to see the original reports and documents, and where possible, I'd like
to see the original data upon which the report is based.
<p>
And if you can't find something, ask me. I've got xeroxed copies of a lot of stuff,
including almost all of the research reports where A.A. failed the clinical trials.

<p>
And the bottom line is still, you know, that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin41">A.A. is a failure</a>.
It doesn't matter how
much you believe that A.A. saved your life and that you belong in it (for the rest
of your life), A.A. still fails to make alcoholics quit drinking. And you recognize that
 &#8212; you just said so above. Everything else
is irrelevant and a distraction &#8212; all of the talk about spirituality and brotherhood
and fellowship and feelings of belonging, and Serenity and Gratitude &#8212; that is all
just a distraction from the fact that A.A. does not accomplish
what it said it would accomplish &#8212; to make the alcoholics quit drinking and save
their lives.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	A letter I got today from an AA member<br>

<p>
Hi,
<p>
Thank you very much for your site.
<p>
I left AA a few years ago after ten
years of keeping my mouth shut about all the abuse I saw, particularly
toward those who dared to think for themselves. Today, because I felt
like finally saying something, I joined an AA site (AA-meetings.com) and
shared my experience on a thread about atheists (since I am one) in AA.
I thought the author was asking for atheists to write, since she said
that and all. Here is the first response I got. Believe me, I'm not
surprised, that's why I never said anything in a meeting. But it is just
a little too funny (in a very scary way, of course). My post is above
the bold line, the first response is below. There are plenty more like it.

<p>
All the best to you,<br>
Sarah

I have done the steps numerous times, though, I'm sure that some would
argue I didn't do them the &quot;right&quot; way because I don't believe in a god.
I was willing to believe that the universe is greater than me and that
if there is a god, I'm not it. That was all I needed to make my start.
I've found a fair bit of anti-intellectualism in AA, and this is one
area that makes this trend highly apparent.
<p>
Anyway, as my thinking
faculties were restored, I found that I could use my brain and think for
myself. Yes, AA is a spiritual program, but I think we would all agree
that, &quot;faith without works is dead.&quot; Thus, for some of us, spirituality
is action. I've heard for YEARS that, &quot;works without faith is also
dead&quot;, but I don't agree. I have become sane, productive, healthy and
have amazing relationships that were not possible. And, yes, I did it,
not a god. Though this is anathema to many in AA, it is my experience.
And, after all, our experience, strength and hope is what we share, and
I have no lack of any of them.
<p>
As hard as it may be for some &quot;believers&quot; to believe, I apply the
principles in all of my affairs, do regular inventory work and feel that
I have gained a great deal from AA. I just don't need anyone to do my
thinking for me. But hey, I've only been sober 12 years, what the heck
would I possibly know?

So you are saying &quot;you&quot; did it....without any help? If you put your
trust and faith in yourself, why AA? AA is a spiritual program. That is
the way it was founded...
<p>
I think you &quot;doth protest to much&quot; You are trying to convince &quot;yourself&quot;
there is no &quot;Higher Power&quot;. You need to look at your AA group and
friends. They are your &quot;Higher Power&quot;...they are carrying you.
<p>
Do you sponser anyone? Do you do service outside of your group?
<p>
You say you have &quot;experience, strength and hope&quot; Do you really beleive
that the Strength comes form &quot;you&quot;? Why didn't you have that strength
before AA...And what do you base &quot;your hope&quot; on? Yourself?
<p>
You also state you have 12 years sober ? Then you should KNOW YOU DIDN'T
DO IT ALONE.....You sort of sound like a 12 year old. you are just
rebelling. GROW UP and admit YOU didn't do get sober all by &quot;YOURSELF&quot;
and without a &quot;Highr Power&quot;....
<p>
I truly beleive that if you keep on this road of &quot;self&quot;, &quot;pride&quot; and all
you will be brought down. &quot;Pride cometh before a fall&quot;
<p>
So my suggestion. Is LET IT GO...you don't have to admit to anyone but
yourself that there is a &quot;Higher Power&quot;..But quit try to convnice others
that you &quot;did it&quot; without one. No one but YOU think You have that kind
of Power. The rest of us just hope the best for you and that keep coming
back

Hi Sarah,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, they certainly do respect your intellect and your opinion
and beliefs, don't they?

<p>
So much for freedom of religion in Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
I couldn't help but notice
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="newwin44">
the bait-and-switch trick</a>
in:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
So you are saying &quot;you&quot; did it....without any help? If you put your
trust and faith in yourself, why AA? AA is a spiritual program. That is
the way it was founded...
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, actually, the way that A.A. was founded was that Bill Wilson wrote that you 
could have any religious beliefs you wish, or none at all:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.
All of its Twelve Steps are but suggestions.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 26.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But later, that changed into:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I was beginning to see that I would require implicit faith, like
a small child, if I was going to get anywhere.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, <i>The News Hawk</i>, Page 259.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, I also like the logical fallacy of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="newwin51">
<i>Assuming Facts Not In Evidence</i></a>:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You also state you have 12 years sober ? Then you should KNOW YOU DIDN'T
DO IT ALONE.....&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh really? And that statement is made based upon what facts? What valid
clinical test established that only people who get zapped by the
&quot;Higher Power&quot; of a peculiar heretical religion can get and stay sober?

<p>
And then I love the fear-mongering:

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
I truly beleive that if you keep on this road of &quot;self&quot;, &quot;pride&quot; and all
you will be brought down. &quot;Pride cometh before a fall&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

Ah yes, the Boogey-Man will get you if you don't obey the rules and believe in the
Right Religion.

<p>
And the quote is incorrect, too. The correct quote is Proverbs 16:18,<br>
<i>&quot;Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.&quot;</i>
<p>
Personally, I don't consider this statement to be prideful or haughty:<br>
<font color="green">
<b>&quot;I got sober by myself, without joining any cult religion or
imagining that I could get
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="newwin48"><i>Miracles On Demand</i></a>
by praying to Santa Claus.&quot;</b>
</font>
<p>
It is actually extremely prideful, haughty, and arrogant for any A.A. group
members to claim that they have God Almighty waiting on them hand and
foot and delivering miracles whenever they need one. What makes them so special?
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#Holmes" target="newwin49">Reverend John Haynes Holmes</a>,
pastor of the Community Church in New York, also said
that it was blasphemy.  He criticized the bragging of the theological
father of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dr. Frank Buchman, with this statement:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;I count it blasphemy for Dr. Buchman, or anybody else,
to pretend to testify to what God has done for him while
humanity is at this moment perishing.&quot;</font><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
