Subject: A new song<br>

<p> 
Terrance and Friends,
<p>
I suggest a song along the lines of Tina Turner's &quot;What's love got to do with it&quot;, but with what's god got to do with it.  Arnold Zedville may be able to write and sing it.  I do not know how to contact Arnold.
I may have suggested this before but memory escapes me.
<p>
Thank you for all you do.<br>

Hello again, Bob,
<p>
Yes, that sounds like a good song. I don't know how to contract Arnold Zedville either, but maybe we could
write it ourselves. Surely there must be at least one good lyricist and one good composer among
the readers. I'll have to think about it and see what I come up with.
And maybe many readers have a few lines  or a verse to suggest.
<p>
Have a good day now.

I loved your replies.   If aa kills more than it saves what is the answer?  Will power?  I have no doubt that many aa members were nuts and still are.  So what is the answer?  Many great solutions and people had some pretty dark areas of there lives with just as bright parts.  Ben Franklin Einstein Lincoln Roosevelt had some pretty bright spots but as I am sure you know had there dark and unpleasant side.  But really I would love another answer other than aa and love to be able to drink again and control it what is the answer then?

Hello again, Patrick,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. Yes, will power is an answer. But it isn't the only answer.
To quit drinking and stay quit for a long time, like for the rest of your life, requires
a certain amount of will power. It doesn't matter whether someone is in A.A. or not in A.A.,
he will still need will power to avoid taking a drink when temptation strikes.
When an A.A. member does not drink for years, it isn't God who is doing it, it is the A.A. member
controlling his own hands and his own mouth by using his own will power.

<p>
But you don't have to depend on just will power alone.
There is a very long list of things that are helpful to recovery, like SMART, SOS, Lifering, WFS, RR, and MM.
What those things have in common is that they are all evidence-based methods, rather than faith-based.

I just compiled a list of all of those helpful things, and made a new web page out of it:

<p>
So check that out.

Subject: Thank You!<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I will be forever grateful to you for all the hard work you have done exposing the dangerous cult of AA. Besides being filled with interesting and thought provoking information, your meticulous research, sense of humor and patience when answering the 12 step true believers makes your site a pleasure to read. Those thought stopping slogans really do seem to work, don't they?

<p>
I have a long history of depression and alcohol abuse. After a four year period of sobriety I relapsed and began a long slow descent into oblivion, snowballing towards the end. By the time I was done I had drank myself out of both of my jobs, was pretty close to losing my apartment, and was an all day, every day, blackout drinker. I was a horrific mess. At the time I was in no condition to choose and facilitate my own admission into a rehab, so I asked my parents for help. Having no previous experience with substance abuse (I spent the last 20 years avoiding them so they wouldn't know I had a problem), they asked a friend who is a counselor (and AA true believer) for help finding an appropriate place. I met her for coffee and she asked me a few questions about my substance use and my spiritual beliefs. With what other disease are you constantly asked about your belief in God (always a singular God) as part of planning your &quot;treatment&quot; plan?  I then strongly indicated my desire to go to a NON 12 step facility. I also mentioned my atheism, the unlikelihood of my finding a Higher Power and my complete lack of a desire to do so. So where did I end up you ask? At a 12 step facility! Of course. Granted, from the horror stories I hear it is one of the nicer ones, but still, a 12 step facility.  At one point the owner of the facility, who also acted as a counselor, related a story where her 80 something year old husband, who was recovering from surgery and on blood thinners, fell and began bleeding profusely.  Her response? A complete 12 step inventory. Then she called 911. What?!  I think her point was supposed to be that after 50 years of &quot;incorporating the 12 steps into her life on a daily basis&quot; they had become an automatic response that helped her through tough situations. YIkes.  Sounds like a dangerous waste of time to me!

<p>
The counselor assigned to me was on vacation when I arrived, but she apparently had been filled in by the other staff about my atheism, so one of her first questions upon meeting me was &quot;Why are you mad at God?&quot;. That's when I knew it was going to be a long 28 days. I tried to explain that I didn't believe in God and that for me, being angry with God was the equivalent of being mad at the Tooth Fairy or Santa.  Every single individual counseling session inevitably ended up revolving around my atheism and her mission to find me a higher power.  She tried endless mindless acronyms on me and of course had me read the condescending and insulting &quot;For The Agnostic&quot; in the Big Book, as if that insane drivel would suddenly make me have a &quot;spiritual experience&quot;. When it was clear I wasn't going for that, she had me read &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; and &quot;Many Lives, Many Masters&quot;.  Reincarnation as a higher power?  When none of that provoked a spiritual awakening she continued to bombard me with thought stopping slogans and the usual AA threats of imminent relapse, leading to death, jail and institutions. Also, they are sending quite the mixed message by proclaiming addiction is a disease, then claiming the only solution is finding God. That's insane. Do they do that to cancer patients? If it actually worked, why wouldn't it work for every disease? What makes the alcoholics so special?

<p>
This is also the woman who informed me of a problem with my insurance in the hallway, in full view and within hearing of other clients, and went when on to suggest I call my parents and ask them for payment for the remaining three weeks, about $9000.  Very professional.  At the time I had been free from alcohol, benzos and nicotine for about a week.  As you can imagine, I was a complete physical and emotional mess.  This woman didn't even have the decency to pull me into her office, a mere 5 feet away, for privacy. To add to my feeling of vulnerability, I was returning from the half hour of exercise allowed a day and was dripping wet, wearing only a bathing suit and a towel. It is absolutely terrifying that this woman is getting paid to tell anyone anything, let alone how to live their life! She discouraged me from looking for work or going back to school and advised me that she thought I should move in with my parents (I'm 38 and have been on my own since I was 16), go to outpatient rehab for at least 6 months and of course, do 90 meetings in 90 days. Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome was never mentioned and no advice on relapse prevention was offered besides AA meetings. Ironically, I learned more about illicit drugs in rehab than I did in twenty years of being an active drug user.  AA was offered as a panacea for everyone, no matter what their drug of choice was, and there were constant readings from approved AA literature.  We received no education whatsoever about possible dual diagnosis issues or substances other than alcohol, which is ridiculous considering about 80% of the girls in my program at any given time were there for opiates. When concerns were raised, they were told just to substitute your drug of choice for the word alcohol in your head. Out of the 8-10 hours a day of structured meetings, lectures, educational videos and so forth one hour a week was devoted to substances besides alcohol when a local NA chapter held a meeting at the rehab.

<p>
For the sake of appearances and to appease my family I continued to attend AA after being released from rehab for a while, but as time went on I found it harder and harder not to roll my eyes or snort derisively at the mindless recitations of old timers and true believers. I was recently reassured by a well meaning cult member not to worry-  she had been an atheist when she first started coming around to AA too, but now she has found her higher power.  I certainly have no shame about being an atheist and have no desire to turn my will over to a god that I just made up on the spot. Oh, and then I am supposed to spend my free time listening for messages from this god? If David Berkowitz had been in AA he could have claimed all his messages to kill had been from his Higher Power. Or any schizophrenic encouraged by their sponsors to stop taking their medications and start to hear voices. I don't see how anyone can claim AA or their  program of sponsorship isn't dangerous.

<p>
&quot;Suggesting&quot; to newcomers that they get a sponsor and follow all their advice is at the very best irresponsible and at worst dangerous and possibly life-threatening. Wanting to go with the flow and stop the constant harassment about getting a sponsor,  I found myself one, a woman with 21 years clean and sober, one day at a time (what a hard to way to count the time, praying every day that you won't drink tomorrow, why not just quit and be done with it). Actually, she approached me and asked if I needed a sponsor. That should have been a warning sign. I found out later she was unemployed and collected sponsees like it was her full time job. I agreed, since I didn't actually have any intention of actually doing the steps, having been forced to do them in rehab and I didn't care to rehash every terrible thing that I had ever happened in my life and &quot;find my part in it&quot;. My self esteem was already low enough. Although a nice enough woman and I'm sure with good intentions, (we all know where those lead) I had no idea what I had let myself in for. She offered many gems of advice, such as how she had used a rainbow as her higher power, and she started each of our meetings with a long heartfelt prayer.  She was baffled by my atheism and couldn't wait until we got to the &quot;We Agnostics&quot; chapter, because she felt that would fix my lack of faith.  She actually said to me once &quot;So if you don't believe in God, then what do you believe in?  Science??&quot;. Sigh. Needless to say, our relationship was destined to be short lived. She had to keep asking her sponsor for advice about how to handle me since I was an atheist. Yet another warning sign.  Really? After 21 years of sobriety you still need to call your sponsor every day and ask them what to do? When exactly does the actual recovery part come in? I found out she was in another 12 step program and had a sponsor for that program as well. How does that work? What if they offer different advice for the same problem? Which one takes precedence? Do they meet with each other !
and come up with a plan for their joint sponsee? The whole system is absurd. Did Bill W. or Dr. Bob ever have sponsors or work their own ridiculous 12 steps?

<p>
I find it completely disheartening that it is 2014 and this is the best our healthcare system has to offer.
$12,000 for a crazy, government-sanctioned cult religion? And after all that, it didn't even work.
I didn't care for their flavor of Kool-Aid. In spite of not drinking it and stopping going to meetings,
I just had five months without a drink and have never felt better.  There should be a t-shirt that
says &quot;I went to rehab and all I got was this cult religion&quot;.

<p>
Anyway, sorry for rambling and many thanks again for shining a light of sanity on the addiction field.  I hope you are enjoying the warm weather and your bird friends!

<p>
Have a good day,<br>

Your logical analysis of their crazy beliefs is quite correct. The 12-Step program makes no sense
because it is really all about getting converted to their religion, not about recovering from
a disease or an addiction.

Subject: getting past it<br>

<p>
Thanks for all the effort you have expended on this project. As one who has
had a long interest in &quot;cult&quot; processes, it is a resource.

<p>
My own disillusionment of AA began about two decades ago, and after some
soul-searching, left it all behind me. I did make some visits in recent
times, but not from a need to avoid drinking. I found that all of the
behaviours I witnessed that caused me to leave so long ago, were still
happening.

<p>
Looking back on the decades away from AA and its worldview, I got past it I
think by raising two beautiful, adopted little boys from a difficult
background, engaged with the community at large rather than the AA sect,
and took an education., worked in a profession (an anthropologist) and
forgot it all. No, I never went out and got drunk from not going to
meetings. No, I did not have an empty life, or any of the other dubious
propositions made to retain membership.

<p>
It has been difficult to get past the tsunami of hypocrisy I witnessed, and
the astounding levels of both organizational manipulation/exploitation, and
yet also the nature of the individuals coming into those rooms looking to
utilize others to satisfy their various appetites. It was a circus of evil,
propelled by greed, ignorance, fear, power, and exploitation. It is the
perfect feeding ground for persons who are of an extractive nature, and the
bewildered, frightened persons who come there looking for relief are
harmed, some permanently. Nobody does anything to stop it. I could provide
such a long list of what I witnessed....

<p>
My original exit was propelled (after ten years in it) after seeing too
much harm being done, and then the two great old-timer guys who make all
the speeches to hundreds of people, were sponsoring young women secretly,
and were having sex with them too. One night, over coffee, the two of them
made arrangements to swap sponsees, because each was bored with the sex so
a sex-sponsee-swap was made with not the slightest notion of this as wrong.
I paid for my coffee, and never went back. My recent visits after 20 years
reveal the same thing in another city. One man moved a homeless
drinker/drugger into his home, is &quot;sponsoring&quot; her, sleeping with her, and
boasting in the meeting about this being a noble act.

<p>
Nothing's changed.<br>
Being around such persons is harmful to myself. I can't do anything to stop
it, and the level of mistrust of all humanity is raised again. I have to
get past this.
<p>
Wish to hell I'd never took a second look at it.<br>
It's like I want to wring my brain out in the sink!<br>
One can get vicarious traumatization from too much exposure to these dark
corners of humanity.<br>
Be well<br>

Hello Michael,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story. I'm adding that one to the
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">A.A. Horror Stories</a> list too.
(I got two new horror stories, just today.)
<p>
Yes, that thing about distrusting all of humanity as a result of your A.A. experiences
rings a bell. I remember feeling the same way too.  And when you pile the rest of the racket
on top of it &#8212; fake counselors selling cult religion, &quot;treatment centers&quot; that are just
profiting from human suffering by selling quack medicine &#8212; it's enough to really make you
cynical and wonder if everybody is a heartless crook with an evil ulterior motive.
 I'm happy to say that after 13 years away from A.A., that effect wore off.

<p>
Have a good day now.

To All,

<p>
I can't overemphasize how good this guy is. Like J.H.K. he possesses a brilliant mind and a deft use of the English language. Also like J.H.K. he cuts through the bullshit, going directly to the heart of our current dilemma &#8212; IE industrial civilization itself, and the fact that it is not sustainable. My only complaint is that he is always long-winded. Here is an excerpt from his essay of July 23, 2014:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Most of the people who have ever lived, it bears
remembering, had no expectation that the future would be any better than the
world that they saw around them. The majority of them assumed as a matter of
course that the future would be much like the present, while quite a few of
them believed instead that it would be worse. Down through the generations,
they faced the normal human condition of
poverty, sickness, toil, grief, injustice, and the inevitability of their own
deaths, and still found life sufficiently worth living to meet the challenges
of making a living, raising families, and facing each day as it came.

<p>
That's normal for our species. Buying into a fantasy that insists that the
universe is under an obligation to fulfill your daydreams is not. Get past that
fantasy, and past the shock of disillusionment that follows its departure, and
it's not actually that difficult to make sense of a world that doesn't progress
and shows no interest in remaking itself to fit an overdeveloped sense of human
entitlement. The downside is that you have to give up any attempt to smuggle
the same fantasy back into your mind under some other name or form, and when
some such belief system has been central to the worldview of your culture for
the last three centuries or so, it's always tempting to find some way to
retrieve the fantasy. Still, falling in with that temptation just lands you
back where you were, waiting
for a future the universe is serenely unwilling to provide.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
and

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It would be hard enough to face the difficult future ahead
of us if we came to the present moment out of an era of sober realism and close
attention to the hard facts of the human condition. It's far harder to find
ourselves where we are when that forces us to own up to the hard fact that
we've been lying to ourselves for three hundred years. Disillusionment is a
bitter pill at the best of times. When
the illusion that's just been shattered has been telling us that the future is
obliged to conform to our fondest fantasies, whatever those happen to be, it's
no wonder that it's as unwelcome as it is.

<p>
Bitter though the pill may be, though, it's got to be choked
down, and like the bitter medicines of an earlier day, it has a tonic effect.
Come to terms with the fact that faith in progress was always destined to be
disappointed, that the law of diminishing returns and the hard limits of
thermodynamics made the dream of endless guaranteed betterment a delusion &#8212; an
appealing delusion, but a delusion all the same &#8212; and after the shock wears off,
you'll find yourself standing on common ground shared with the rest of your
species, asking questions that they asked and answered in their time.<br>

Note to the other readers: J.H.K. is James Howard Kunstler, who has a web site
on the Internet, and a blog called
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321145231/http://kunstler.com/" target="_blank">Clusterfuck Nation</a>.
He is a harsh critic of mass delusion, like the popular delusion that the oil supply will
never run out, and we will live lives of &quot;happy motoring to the suburbs&quot; forever.
The Archdruid Report is another critic and chronicler of contemporary culture.
It's also on the Internet:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321145231/http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">
http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/</a> .
<p>
The funny thing is, I see the same self-delusion in the so-called &quot;recovery community&quot;
and in the motoring public.
Everybody is <i>in denial</i> about the real facts of the matter, and afraid of the truth.
People dodge the truth, and run away from the truth, and nervously yammer
platitudes and clich&eacute;s and thought-stopping slogans, and insist that there is no problem.
<p>
Insecure motorists say, &quot;Oh, the scientists will always find another source of oil. The planet is
swimming in oil. Look at how fracking is working.&quot;
<p>
(Nope. Actually, fracking is a very short-lived phenomenon that desperately tries to get the last
little bit of gas and oil out of the ground. Many fracked fields go dry or gasless
in 5 or 10 years.  That isn't much of a future. And the only reason why fracking is even feasable now
is because oil is over $100 per barrel. Now the oil companies are scrounging for small amounts of
oil and gas that were not financially profitable to extract 20 years ago when oil was $14 per barrel.
And they stubbornly deny that fracking is polluting our drinking water. That will
be the next crisis: We will run out of clean drinking water, partly due to fracking.)
<p>
And Steppers say, &quot;Of course we have the thing that works. Why we would all die if it didn't work.
The Steps aren't hurting anybody.&quot; Denial, denial, denial.

Is the A. for anonymous?  :)

<p>
First, a disclosure.  I was a member of AA for several years, about 20 years ago.  I haven't disassociated from AA.  I drifted to OA for about another five years, since that was my first addiction, and then just drifted away, period.  I was past my hardcore substance abuse by the time I got to AA, but still smoking marijuana once or twice a week.  A friend was in it, and she told me about the inventory, which sparked my interest.  The speakers were entertaining at times, and some were even wise.  I found an educated guy with a dark sense of humor, and asked him to sponsor me and supervise and hear my inventory.  He would only do it if I got totally abstinent, so I stopped smoking altogether.  I have kept that up, and I can't really tell you why, since I drink a few oz. of vodka now and then.  It's fun once in a while, and the addition was never there for the alcohol. 

<p>
I think my time in AA, and particularly OA, was helpful to me.  I met some really smart people, and got very close to couple of them.  (Actually, the people in OA were smarter, on average.)  I had/have some antisocial/anti-authority tendencies, and the AA principles helped me control those better.  Trying on the idea of a god probably helped as well.  Now, I'm just the same agnostic my Dad raised me to be.  But better intentioned than before.  . 

<p>
I never thought AA./OA was the only way.  How could that really be?  But neither did I see a lot of harm.  I find your head-on onslaught kind of puzzling.  Person to person, I'm curious about the impetus behind that, but that's for another day.  
<p>
I found a number of aspects of your site thought provoking and worthwhile.  I like making things better (or at least better as I see better).  I have some critiques and suggestions about the site, if you want them.  But that's for another day, too, and no offense taken if you don't want my opinions.    

<p>
Here's why I'm writing. I'm very interested in ADHD (aflicts my god-daughter, and in retrospect, an underlying driver in a lot of
my history), and in readiness for change, best-methods coaching, and the like.

<p>
You've read quite a bit.  Did you run across anything really great/special
related to any of those topics.  If so, please refer me to the persons
and/or writings.   

<p>
Thank you in advance for your time and attention.

<p>
Best regards,

<p>
Ben

Hello Ben,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question. Alas, I'm no expert on ADHD. You can do better using
Google to search the Internet for relevant information.
<p>

</ul>

<p>
I do have to comment on one line:
<font color="black">
&quot;I had/have some antisocial/anti-authority tendencies, and the AA principles helped me control those better.&quot;</font>
There are no A.A. &quot;principles&quot;.  Principles are things like,
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Honesty is the best policy.&quot;
<li> &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;
<li> &quot;Let he who has never sinned cast the first stone.&quot;
<li> &quot;Judge not lest ye be so judged.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
What A.A. has is <i>cult recruiting and indoctrination practices</i>.
Things like &quot;declare yourself powerless&quot;, and &quot;confess your list
of sins to your sponsor&quot;, are <i>cult practices</i>.  Dr. Frank Buchman called
his cult practices &quot;spiritual principles&quot;, and Bill Wilson just copied
the whole thing &#8212; both the terminology and the practices.
The so-called A.A. principles are actually brainwashing technology. Dr. Frank Buchman went over to China
as a missionary in the late nineteen-teens and early nineteen-twenties, and taught his mind-changing
conversion techniques to the Chinese, and the local Communists learned them and turned around and
used them on American prisoners of war during the Korean War.
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">Look here</a> for Dr. Robert Jay Lifton's
description  of those brainwashing techniques.
<p>
Now when you say that they cured some of your anti-authoritarian tendencies, I can believe that,
because
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#obey_Buchman" target="_blank"><i>OBEY</i> is one of the fundamental rules of both Buchmanism</a>
and A.A.  Frank Buchman was a fascist who wanted everybody to obey him without hesitation.
And so did Bill Wilson.
In both Buchmanism and A.A., you are supposed to obey your sponsor without question. Yes,
Buchman's groups had dictatorial sponsors too.

<p>
I have no doubts that you found some good people who could give you some sage advice.
If you get lucky, you can find a wise man in OA, or at church, or even at the local cafeteria.
It's just the luck of the draw.
I even have an honorary club for the wise people who go to A.A. meetings to save newcomers from
the bad sponsors:
<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">the Newcomers Rescue League</a>.
<p>
I can tell you about the impetus to start the Orange Papers: read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction to the web site, here</a>.
And then you can read

The carpenter I hired to help me restore an old farmhouse had just finished a rough first day on the job. A flat tire made him lose an hour of work, his electric saw quit, and now his ancient pickup truck refused to start. While I drove him home, he sat in stoney silence. On arriving, he invited me in to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the branches with both hands. After opening the door, he underwent an amazing transformation. His tanned face was wreathed in smiles and he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss. Afterward, he walked me to my car. We passed the tree, and my curiosity got the better of me. I asked him about what I had seen him do earlier. &quot;Oh, that's my trouble tree,&quot; he replied. &quot;I know I can't help having troubles on the job, but one thing for sure, troubles don't belong in the house with my wife and the children. So I just hang them up on the tree every night when I come home. Then in the morning, I pick them up again.&quot; &quot;Funny thing is,&quot; he smiled, &quot;when I come out in the morning to pick them up, there aren't nearly as many as I remember hanging up the night before.&quot;

That horrors of aa is not real aa.  You are comparing aa groups that are not following aa true principles.   I know NO aa members that state get off your meds or have sex with older aa people and only talk with aa people.  Your statements here are a fallacy in argument.  This would be like saying some priests in the Catholic Church are bad and are sex offenders therefore all   Priest are bad.   Yes I am sure there are some bad sick people in aa that day and do stupid shit.  But the people that I hang with in aa would never agree to not seeking outside help or taking prescribed medications.  There are people in every group that has a great aim and mission to do great things and twist it and give it a bad name.  The church, aa, Islam all have good aims but there are some stupid ass people in these groups that are sick!  That does not make the group as a whole bad.  I still state you with all of your intelligence could twist everything you are saying to the positive but for some reason you want to find the bad in things instead of the good.  U still have not shared what the answer is?

Hello again, Patrick,
<p>
Claiming that the evils of A.A. are not &quot;the real A.A.&quot; is a classic
old dodge.  A.A. defenders routinely use that line, and it isn't true at all.

<p>
Just what is &quot;the real A.A.&quot;? It keeps changing, depending on the conversation:

<ul>
<p><li>
First, the real A.A. is what Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob created. They are considered
the Saints of A.A., and their teachings are allegedly <i>The Message From God</i>.
A.A. members reverently read <i>The Big Book</i> and <i>As Bill Sees It</i> out loud at meetings
as if they are words from The Prophet.
<p><li>
But then, when you point out
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">what sick insane men Bill Wilson
and Dr. Bob really were</a>,
the A.A. promoters claim that the real A.A. program is the 12 Steps and the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out what insane Buchmanite nonsense is in <i>the Book</i>,
and how
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
the 12 Steps are really just the cult recruiting and indoctrination practices of Dr. Frank Buchman</a>,
then the &quot;real A.A.&quot; is <i>The Fellowship</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out how many
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">con artists, psychopaths</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">sexual predators and rapists</a>
make up the Fellowship, they claim that the real A.A. is the teachings of Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob.
</ul>
<p>
Baloney. It's all really A.A.
<ul>
<li> Whatever is done to newcomers by the A.A. oldtimers is &quot;the real A.A.&quot;
<li> Whatever is taught in A.A. meetings is the real A.A.
<li> Whenever a sponsor seduces a cloudy-headed freshly detoxed young woman, for her that is the real A.A.
<li> Whenever a crazy sponsor tells someone not to take his or her medications, that is the real A.A.
<li> Whenever A.A. oldtimers lie about the real history of A.A., that is the real A.A.
<li> Whenever A.A. true believer members begin an A.A. meeting by reading out loud Bill Wilson's lie about
&quot;RARELY have we seen a person fail...&quot;, that is the real A.A.
</ul>

<p>
Your Catholic Church analogy is a logical fallacy. Of course there are bad priests, and also bad
bishops and bad cardinals who let them keep on molesting children. But that does not make all priests,
bishops, and cardinals bad. That is painting with too broad of a brush.
(The logical fallacy is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#generalize" target="_blank">Generalize, and the Sweeping Generality</a>.)
However, the behavior of those men certainly does reflect on the morality of the whole church.
<p>
And this is an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>,
and it's also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a>:

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
The fact that you can find bad people everywhere does not excuse A.A. for selling quackery and faith
healing to the sick people, and lying to them about how well it works as a &quot;solution to alcoholism&quot;.
The <b>Primary Purpose</b> of A.A. is to push the crazy beliefs of an evil old cult religion from
the nineteen-thirties.
<p>
Lastly, I do not just seek to find the bad in everything. I was forced to notice the evil in
Alcoholics Anonymous by
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">having proselytizing A.A. members shoving it on me in the guise of
&quot;treatment&quot; for &quot;alcoholism&quot;</a>.

<p>
And I did share what &quot;the answer&quot; is:
<p>

Have a good day now.

Subject: Deprogramming from aa<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I attended aa and been sober for two and a half years now.  I questioned it going in, bought in to the programme, and decide to quit going as I felt it was disempowering me as a person.    I don't want to be committed to lifelong meetings and having people telling me how to act and feel.   I joined to quit drinking not join a church group.

<p>
Just need a little support to get me over this dependence on aa and meetings.

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
Tom

Hello Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on breaking free. Yes, I think you can find some emotional
support around here.
You could also join the forum, and you will find some kindred spirits there.

The honeybees have found that they can get into another hummingbird feeder. There is just a thin crack
between the pieces of plastic
where they can get their proboscises into the sugar-water.
</center>
<p>
Those little guys (girls, really) are so eager to get at the sugar-water that they are pushing each other
out of the way and crawling all over each other. Now they are not fighting &#8212; nobody is stinging anybody
else, and in fact, they are probably all from the same hive so they have no reason to fight over the
sugar-water &#8212; but they sure are in a feeding frenzy.
<p>
 I suspect that they want the water as much as
the sugar. We are in the middle of a heat wave here, and everything is drying up, and the flowers are
not offering much moisture in the form of nectar, so the bees are eager to get into a mother lode like
a hummingbird feeder that has a limitless supply of sugar-water. The bee hive must be very thirsty in
this heat, so these bees are probably taking the sugar-water back to the hive and sharing it with
everyone else.
Ordinarily, when bees make honey, they dump their nectar into a honeycomb cell and then a hive worker fans the
cells with her wings and drives off the excess moisture, and concentrates the nectar into honey.
In this heat, I guess that the bees are consuming the water themselves, and also
sharing it with their larvae as a thirst-quenching drink.

This bee will still extract all of the nectar that she can get out of this flower.
