A.A. scores a 10, and deserves a 20.<br>
Both of the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous were mental train wrecks.
<p>
<h2>Bill Wilson:</h2>

Alcoholics Anonymous founder William Griffith Wilson
was insane, really insane, clinically diagnosable, as well as being
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">grossly, feloniously, dishonest</a>,
a pathological liar,
abusive to others, manipulative, vindictive, exploitative, and a
phony holy man.
<p>

<ul>
<li>
William G. Wilson was a
clinically diagnosable (and diagnosed) raving lunatic who suffered from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">paranoid delusions of grandeur</a>
and a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic
personality disorder</a>.
Bill Wilson was under the care of two psychiatrists, Dr. Harry Tiebout
and Dr. Frances Weeks. Dr. Tiebout said of Bill Wilson:
<font color="black">
&quot;he had been trying to live out the
infantilely grandiose demands of 'His Majesty the Baby.'&quot;</font>

</table>

<p>
Wilson suffered from
<b><a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">disease number
297.10</a>, &quot;Delusional (Paranoid) Disorder, Grandiose Type&quot;</b>,
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
301.81, Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>,
as defined by
the American Psychiatric Association in their book
<i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>,
third and fourth editions (DSM-III-R and DSM-IV).
The <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">bombastic, grandiose,
and completely delusional things</a> that Bill Wilson wrote
in the books <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank"><i>Twelve Steps
and Twelve Traditions</i></a> leave little doubt about that.
Wilson routinely made grandiose statements like
that he was &quot;walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe&quot;,
and that his miraculous cure for alcoholism &#8212; &quot;getting religion&quot; &#8212; was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery" target="_blank">something
entirely new and original</a>.
Bill even imagined that his Alcoholics Anonymous cult was
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#greatest_of_all_time" target="_blank">one
of the greatest medical and spiritual developments of all time</a>.&quot;</i>
<p>
Delusions of grandeur are unfortunately often seen in people
who suffer from extreme cases of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#substance_abuse" target="_blank">substance
abuse disorders</a>.
It's simple, really: if you rot your brain with enough drugs or
alcohol, you will go insane. No surprise there. Even A.A. says
that, often:<br>
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;John Barleycorn promises us insanity or death.&quot;</i>
</font>
<br>
Well, alcohol gave Bill Wilson the insanity half of it.
<p>
Bill Wilson drank the infamous, often-poisonous,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#bathtub_gin" target="_blank">Prohibition-era
&quot;Bathtub Gin&quot;</a>, and wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that
two or even three bottles of it a day was his usual rate of consumption.
Bathtub Gin was notorious for occasionally being contaminated with
methyl alcohol,
which causes massive neural damage, even if it doesn't blind or kill you.
Even &quot;clean&quot; ethyl alcohol kills brain cells by the millions
when drunk in large quantities for prolonged periods of time, resulting in
<i>Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</i>.
So it isn't surprising that Bill Wilson ended up with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#bathtub_gin" target="_blank">brain damage
and mental problems</a>.
And
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#brain_damage" target="_blank">
Doctor William D. Silkworth said</a> that Bill Wilson was suffering from
brain damage, and likely to go insane if he drank any more.
Bill drank some more.
<p>
Wilson constantly made irrational, grandiose claims like,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Broad_Highway" target="_blank">We feel</a>

Spirit of the Universe.<br></font>

</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have come to believe He would like us to keep our heads
in the clouds with Him, but that our feet ought to be firmly
planted on earth. That is where our fellow travelers are, and
that is where our work must be done. These are the realities for
us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, Chapter 9,
<i>The Family Afterward</i>, page 130.</font> </font>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And Bill repeatedly insisted that we give up our sanity, and
abandon human intelligence and reason, and become just as illogical,
irrational, and crazy as he was:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe
that our human intelligence was the last word... Rather vain of us,
wasn't it?<br>

<p>

<p>

Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge

promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits. Friendly hands stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason
had brought us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and
did not like to lose our support.<br></font>

</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<li> Wilson was a habitual liar, even a compulsive or pathological liar.
He lied about nearly everything:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">his fictitious
&quot;college education&quot; at a &quot;wonderful engineering school&quot;
as a scientist and an atheist</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-rroot960.html#stock_broker" target="_blank" target="_blank">his imaginary history
of working as a stock broker</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the terrible failure rate
of his faith-based Alcoholics Anonymous quit-drinking program.
<li> <a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the cult-religion origins
of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the history of A.A. and the Twelve Steps</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">the religious nature
of the program</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">the financial history of the <i>Big Book</i></a>.
<li> <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">his &quot;inability&quot; to stop cheating
on his wife and acting as a sexual predator</a>, taking unethical advantage
of the pretty women who came to A.A. seeking help with their alcoholism.
<li> In the <i>Big Book, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>, the bible
of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson strongly declared (in 1939) that
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#atheism_impossible" target="_blank">he had never been an atheist</a> (page 10).
Then he went on to brag in his following books that he had been
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#conservative_atheist" target="_blank">a conservative atheist</a> who was
educated at a wonderful engineering school that had taught him that man is God.
Obviously, Bill was just making up stories as he went along.
<li> Bill Wilson even lied about lying &#8212; he maintained that Alcoholics Anonymous
was a program that required
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;grasping and developing a manner of living which
demands rigorous honesty.&quot;</font> (The <i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)
</ul>
<p>
<li>
Bill Wilson behaved like a typical cult leader:
<ul>
<li>
He took everything for himself &#8212; the power,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">the fame, the publicity</a>,
the prestige,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">the money</a>,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">the women</a>, and
<a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html" target="_blank">all of the credit for A.A. successes</a>
&#8212; while exhorting the other members
to work selflessly, anonymously, with no thought of personal profit.
<li> Bill Wilson went on speaking tours across the country
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">where he routinely
broke his anonymity</a> and got his story and picture printed in the
newspapers.
<li> He even went and
<a href="orange-Bill_Senate.html" target="_blank">testified before Congress</a>,
identifying himself as Bill W.,
the founder and leader of Alcoholics Anonymous.
By 1944, Bill Wilson was the most famous &quot;anonymous&quot; person
in the U.S.A..
</ul>

<p>
<li>
Bill felt that he was special, and entitled
to the best of everything, while other people were just
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">disgusting alcoholics</a> who
were entitled to nothing.

<li> Bill Wilson was outrageously, feloniously, dishonest.
When A.A. was just getting started, he
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">took the money</a> that
had been raised to print the <i>Big Book</i>, the Bible of A.A.
&#8212; money that had been raised through
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Hundred_stock_fraud" target="_blank">a felonious stock
swindle</a>. Wilson also cheated the buyers of the stock out of
any share of the profits from the sales of the book.
And then <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">he stole the ownership of
the copyright to the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
and then took the royalties from the book sales for himself
and Dr. Bob, thus violating
his promises to the 30 other co-authors who were told that the
group would own the book.

<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">Bill promised</a>
the 30 or so other authors of the <i>Big Book</i>
that the book would be jointly owned by all of the authors,
but when he filed for the copyright,
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocImgWindow">Wilson
claimed that he was the sole author</a>, and that he <i>was</i> the
publishing company that owned the copyright &#8212; not just that he
owned the publishing company, but that the company was<br>
<b>&quot;Wm. G. Wilson, trading as Works Publishing Co.&quot;</b>.<br>
That was after
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">Wilson had sold stock in <i>a different</i>
publishing company</a>, <b>&quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;</b>,
which had financed the writing of the book, and was supposed to
publish the book and own the copyright.
Then, with that copyright in hand, Bill Wilson blackmailed the
Alcoholic Foundation (early A.A. organization) into
giving him and Doctor Bob <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">all of
the royalties</a> from the <i>Big Book</i>. Nobody else got
anything.
<p>
<li>
Then Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock3" target="_blank">
cheated all of the stockholders</a> of
the &quot;One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; or
&quot;Works Publishing&quot;
out of any share of the profits.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock3" target="_blank">They had been promised
big profits</a>
when they bought the stock, but when the book-publishing venture
finally became profitable, the stock issue was canceled and
nobody got any of the profits. The profits were diverted to
&quot;The Alcoholic Foundation&quot;, whose biggest expense was
supporting Bill Wilson in comfort for the rest of his life.
</ul>

<p>
<li> And while he was pulling all of those stunts, Bill Wilson
cajoled all the other A.A. members to work selflessly,
to abandon self-seeking, to have no thought of personal profit,
and to quit being so selfish:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The unselfishness of these men as we have come to know
them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their community
spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who has labored
long and wearily in this alcoholic field.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
The Doctor's Opinion, page XXV.</font>

<p>
<a name="self_centeredness"> </a>
&quot;Selfishness, self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our
troubles.&quot;<br>
&quot;Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this
selfishness. We must, or it kills us!&quot;<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William Wilson, Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 62.</font>
<p>

&quot;We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in
our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will
change.&quot;<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The Promises, in The <i>Big Book</i>,
3rd Edition, William Wilson, Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, page 84.</font>
<p>
&quot;To be vital, faith must be accompanied by self sacrifice
and unselfish, constructive action.&quot;<br>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="ftnt05_ret"> </a>
<li>
Apparently, Bill Wilson did not consider it
&quot;selfish&quot; for him to demand that the
Alcoholics Anonymous organization support him in comfort for the
rest of his life, as well as
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#unemployed" target="_blank">buy him a beautiful
house in the country and a Cadillac car</a>.
Bill Wilson ended up being so rich that his wife
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Hartigan" target="_blank">Lois even had a private
secretary</a>, Francis
Hartigan,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt05">5</a></sup></font>
while Bill supported a mistress,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Helen" target="_blank">Helen Wynn</a>, on the side.
While all of that was going on, Bill constantly
complained about being desperately poor, starving, unappreciated,
and unpaid or underpaid for all of his hard work.

<p>
<a name="ftnt04_ret"> </a>
<li> Speaking of which, Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">unfaithful to his wife</a>
both before and after sobriety.
<ul>
<li>
Bill invented the A.A. tradition of &quot;thirteenth stepping&quot; &#8212;
sexually exploiting &#8212; the
attractive new women members who come to A.A. seeking help for alcoholism.
<li>
Bill Wilson used the A.A. headquarters and the A.A. Grapevine offices as employment services for his
string of mistresses. It was understood that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#two_women" target="_blank" target="_blank">
 girls who couldn't even type were routinely hired
as secretaries and office workers because they were Bill's girlfriends</a>.

<li>
Bill was such an outrageous philanderer that the other A.A. members
had to form a
&quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Founders_Watch" target="_blank">Founder's Watch Committee</a>&quot;,
whose job it was to follow Bill Wilson around, and watch him, and
break up budding sexual relationships between Bill and the dewy-eyed
pretty young things
who came to the A.A. meetings, before Bill publicly embarrassed A.A. yet
again.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>
<li>
Bill Wilson exhibited total disregard for the welfare of the attractive young
women who came to A.A. seeking help to recover from alcoholism. Bill just screwed them.
Any doctor who abused his female patients that way would have his
license to practice medicine revoked. But since Bill was just a cult
leader, not a healer, he didn't have any license to lose.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Which brings up the next item: The narcissistic
Bill Wilson was incapable of empathy or of caring for the feelings
of others. He was the kind of guy who could sit and watch his wife
work all day long without offering to help,
even when she was doing heavy labor like shoveling the
snow off of the sidewalk.

By the way, that is the effects of tobacco showing up again. The chain

<p>
<li>
Bill yammered about unconditional love, but he really had a
vindictive mean streak in him, where he would turn on people, and
ostracize them and banish them for disagreeing with him.
 Bill even <a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">sentenced
A.A. members to death by alcoholism</a> for refusing to believe in God
as Bill dictated.
<p>

When they argued and disagreed because
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was helping himself</a> to
all of the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund,
stealing the copyright, and taking all of the credit for writing
the book, Bill drove his best friend, business partner, and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_relapse" target="_blank"><i>Big Book</i> co-author
Henry Parkhurst out of A.A.</a> and to his death,
drunk, penniless, and alone.
<ul>
<li> Bill cheated Henry out of
any royalties from the <i>Big Book</i>, and any stock dividends from
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">the publishing company</a>
which published the <i>Big Book</i>, thus guaranteeing that Henry
would die broke.
<li>
Then Bill abandoned Henry Parkhurst, and left him to die drunk.
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<a name="Poohbah"> </a>
<li>
And Bill Wilson even had
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_relapse" target="_blank">the gall to describe
it all</a> as
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;he [Hank] was on what we nowadays call a 'dry bender'.&quot;
</font>
According to Bill Wilson, it was all Hank's fault for wanting to
be treated fairly &#8212; for wanting his fair share of the credit and the money.
It was also all Hank's fault because Hank criticized Bill Wilson's
drive to become &quot;the Grand Poohbah of Alcoholics
Anonymous&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

<li>
And then Bill Wilson whined and complained about how hard it was to take
that Henry was gone.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Bills_AlAnon" target="_blank">viciously resentful
and vindictive</a>.
Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good" target="_blank">his wife Lois was selfish, silly, and
dishonest</a> &#8212; after she worked in a department store to support him for years
while he stole money from her purse and drank it up &#8212;
because she had criticized him and called him a drunken sot
when he got drunk and threw temper tantrums and tore up the house and threw a
sewing machine at her.<br>

<p>
<a name="chronic_depression"> </a>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
<li> Then Bill went into a fit of deep crippling clinical depression
that lasted for eleven years, and in the middle of it, he wrote
a book that he claimed was a manual that would teach people
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#usefully_whole" target="_blank">how to be
happily and usefully whole</a>
(<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>).
Wilson also claimed that 15 years of practicing the A.A. program and
being &quot;dependent on A.A.&quot; had not produced any
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#baleful" target="_blank">baleful results</a>&quot;,
even when he was so mentally ill that he was under the care of two
psychiatrists &#8212;
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a> and
Dr. Frances Weeks<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
&#8212; and he just laid in bed and stared at the ceiling all day long, or
sat in his office and held his head in his hands all day long.
<p>
Nell Wing, Bill's secretary from 1950 until he died, said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;He would come down to the office many times and sit across
from me and just put his head in his hands and really not be able
to communicate, just almost weep. He used to talk about it.
It baffled him.&quot;
Herb M., general manager at G.S.O. for many years, echoed Nell's
memory: &quot;There were some times when these horrible depressions
would go on and on, for days and days. Then, it was pretty
hard to make contact with him. He'd try and cooperate if you had a
question, but to try and sit down and do any planning with him
at that time was useless. His whole face would fall;
he looked sad, sad, very sad.&quot;<br>

On top of all of that, Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith were heavily into
spiritism, and held regular

sessions</a>&quot;
that featured s&eacute;ances, spirit-rapping, and Ouija boards, to get
messages from &quot;the spirits.&quot;

and acted as a medium, &quot;channelling&quot; the voices of various
discarnate spirits whom he thought chose to speak through him.
Bill imagined that he heard

the voices of both dead people and God</a>.

<p>
And Doctor Robert Smith wasn't much better off:
<p>
<a name="Dr_Bob2"> </a>
The standard A.A. mythology describes Doctor Bob as a wonderful,
wise, kindly, gentle soul.
Bill Wilson wrote that he liked to call Doctor Bob his
&quot;grumpy bear.&quot;
But in the book <i>Children Of The Healer</i>, Doctor Bob's
adopted daughter Sue Smith describes him as cold, aloof, and
autocratic.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Doctor Bob seems
to have been a
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Bob_sorry4you" target="_blank">dogmatic, intolerant</a>,
power-tripping, neurotic religious fanatic who got his kicks by having people
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender
to God on their knees before him</a>.
<p>

<li>
Nan Robertson, in her book which enthusiastically praised A.A.,
described Doctor Bob like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He was a dignified man, gallant to women, yet he had a slangy way
of speaking about them. He called women &quot;frails&quot; or
&quot;skirts,&quot; or, if he really liked one, simply
&quot;woman.&quot;<br>
...<br>
He relished a dirty joke.<br>
...
<br>
Conventional and sometimes dogmatic, Dr. Bob opposed the admission
of women alcoholics into the initially all-male A.A.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Nan Robertson, pages 36-37.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="under_influence"> </a>
<li>
The official Alcoholics Anonymous history book,
<i>PASS IT ON</i>, tells how
Doctor Bob prepared himself for an operation on a patient
by taking &quot;one goofball&quot; (a sedative) and drinking
a beer, to steady his shaking hands (page 149).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And Bill Wilson told the same story in his history of
Alcoholics Anonymous, saying that Doctor Bob went on a binge,
and then...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We got Bob back home and into bed, and right then we made an
alarming discovery. He had to perform a certain operation that only
he could do. The deadline was just three days away; he simply had
to do the job himself; and here he was, shaking like a leaf...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
[Three days later] Anne and I drove him to the hospital at nine
o'clock. I handed him a bottle of beer to steady his nerves so
he could hold the knife, and he went in.... That was June 10,
1935.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 67-71.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nan Robertson described Dr. Bob's recovery from his last binge this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Smith children remember that the sobering up process took three
days. As it happened, Dr. Bob had an operation scheduled for that third day.
Bill loaded the doctor up with the classic folk remedy of the time for
hangovers &#8212; sauerkraut and tomato juice for vitamins and Karo corn syrup
for energy. He gave Bob a few beers to steady his nerves and taper him
off. On the way to City Hospital the morning of the operation, June 10, 1935,
Dr. Bob still had the shakes. Bill gave him another bottle of beer.
Alcoholics Anonymous dates its beginning from that day, the day of Dr.
Bob's last drink.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Nan Robertson, page 54.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Doctor Bob wouldn't postpone the operation on the grounds that he was unfit to
operate &#8212; he didn't want anyone to know that he was unfit.
He operated on a patient even though his hands were shaking so badly
that he had difficulty holding a scalpel and cutting a straight line.
He prepared himself for an operation by drinking alcohol and taking a drug.
That is grossly unethical; it is felony medical malpractice; it completely
disregards the welfare of the patient &#8212; Doctor Bob was gambling
with the patient's life &#8212; and it is the
kind of behavior that warrants revoking a doctor's license to
practice medicine.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Strangely enough, A.A. counts that day as Doctor Bob's first
day of sobriety, and considers that day the founding day of
Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>


<p>
<li>
<a name="ftnt03_ret"> </a>
<a name="bet_your_ass"> </a>
Bill Wilson also wrote that Doctor Bob had a very bad reputation
around Akron, Ohio &#8212; 'when you let the proctologist Dr. Robert Smith operate
on you, &quot;you are really betting your
ass.&quot;'<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font><br>

<p>
<li> In Doctor Bob's own story in the <i>Big Book</i>, Doctor Bob described
himself as a childish fool who was constantly trying to outwit his
wife by sneaking in and hiding bottles of alcohol.
She was constantly turning out his pockets and performing body
searches on him when he came into the house, and he was just as
constantly thinking up new ways to smuggle in booze (read his story in
the <i>Big Book</i>, &quot;Doctor Bob's Nightmare&quot;).

<p>
So to his wife he was just a naughty, irresponsible little boy,
but to his own children he was a cold, cruel, aloof, autocratic dictator.
That is a classic textbook example of a <i>petty tyrant</i>:
someone who is a grovelling toady to his superiors, and a
haughty martinette to his inferiors &#8212; a weak man who gets his jollies
by lording it over someone else who is even weaker, like children.
Or like sick, shaky, weak, detoxing alcoholics, whom he made
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">surrender on their knees
before him</a>.
<p>

<p>
<li> <a name="Susans_quotes"> </a>
Doctor Bob's own children wrote a book about him, where they described
him as a horrible cruel father who ran a badly dysfunctional family.
The book is <i>&quot;Children of the Healer: The Story of
Dr. Bob's Kids As Told to Christine Brewer&quot;</i>, by Bob Smith
and Sue Smith Windows.

Sue Smith wrote about her childhood:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The paddle Dad used on us came from a game that had a ball with it.
One end of the paddle was big and one end was little. Dad used the little
end, the part that hurt like the dickens. Mom would use the big end;
it didn't hurt so much for some reason. Well, Dad found out and he
whittled it down so that both ends were the same. He always kept that paddle
on an inside shelf of the bathroom closet. It was about a half-inch thick.

Sue Smith fought with her father for years over her high-school
sweetheart Ray Windows. She was in love with Ray, and only wanted Ray.
Doctor Bob didn't like Ray because he was just a regular, rather

Doctor Bob got the bright idea of using the older man Ernie Galbraith,
A.A. Number Four, to split up Susan and Ray.
He asked Ernie to show an interest in Sue, to horn in and break up Sue and Ray.
It worked. Ernie was 31 or 32 when Ray and Sue were only 17,
so Ernie was able to just heavy Ray out and scare him off.
Sue later wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At that time, Ernie said he was 30. He must have been a little older &nbsp; ...<br>
I was about 17. &nbsp; ...<br>
I didn't pay any attention to Ernie. I didn't like him. I thought he was a smarty,
you know. He was stout, with reddish hair and a round face with blue eyes.
He was outgoing, the life-of-the-party type. Ernie was single then and
he kept coming to the house, and I think my dad got the bright idea that
if he could get Ernie to take me out, and he'd pay the way, he might be able
to get me away from Ray. We'd go down and get hamburgers, and Dad would buy
them. I knew all that, but I didn't realize it was in connection with Ray at
the time. Now I think it was. I think Dad was using Ernie, and it backfired
on him. &nbsp; ...<br>
...<br>

Ernie gradually started to have some appeal. He was an older person and he had
a good sense of humor. We always had fun. We joked together. He was a real
storyteller. He could make my mom and dad laugh like nobody I've ever seen,
just sitting around the kitchen table, telling stories, and drinking coffee.
Like I say, they were pushing me, so I figured they liked him. And that
was kind of different.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then one time, in the fall of 1937, I went out with Ray, and when I
came home Ernie was at the house. I tried to go upstairs without being noticed,
but he cornered me in the hall and asked me if I'd been out with Ray.
I looked him straight in the eyes and said, &quot;yes.&quot;
So, by gosh, if he didn't whip up and grab me by the arm and get me in the
car and drive over to Ray's apartment. Ray was hanging out on the corner,
as usual, with a bunch of the guys. It was a warm night. Ernie got Ray in
the car and that was when I broke up with Ray. Ernie just told Ray that Dad
didn't want me to see him, and I don't remember what the thing was &#8212; whether
I had to make up my mind or whatever. I don't remember. I didn't say much.
I couldn't even look at Ray. Ray says he got the impression that Ernie was
taking over and that he was out. But I know that for about three weeks I wasn't
worth a nickel around there, burning the toast and forgetting to put
the coffee on. I was grouchy and mean because I had broken up with Ray.
I didn't really want to, but I was beginning to like Ernie then, too. Ray said
he never cried in his life, but he did that night.<br>

<p>
Heartbroken, Ray Windows ended up joining the Army and going to the South Pacific.
<p>

Ernie Galbraith wrote the story
<i>&quot;The Seven Month Slip&quot;</i> for the first edition of the
<i>Big Book</i>. As the story's title implies, Ernie relapsed.
Often. Like all of the time.
The &quot;seven-month slip&quot; was not a little slip after seven
months of sobriety; it was <i>seven months long</i> &#8212; seven more
months of suicidally-intense drinking after only one year of sobriety.
The A.A. program didn't help Ernie to overcome his alcoholism at all.
<p>
And Ernie philandered, too,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">just like Bill Wilson</a>.
Having him
&quot;show an interest in&quot; Sue was really like having the fox guard the
henhouse. Any farmer stupid enough to do that should not be surprised to
find his plumpest hen eaten.
Doctor Bob should have learned something about Ernie from reading his
<i>Big Book</i> story, but no, Doctor Bob didn't learn.
<p>

The teenage girl Susan was pretty
defenseless against the well-practiced older charmer Ernie.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Ernie wasn't the nicest person. I already knew he was a womanizer.
When I went to the WPA school, sometimes he'd take a friend of mine home,
usually Barb or Vianna. &nbsp; ...
He was going with a zillion girls at the same time. He was like Will Rogers &#8212;
he never met a woman he didn't like.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ernie had a lot of appeal, though. Too much appeal. He appealed to everybody.
Like my girlfriend Elgie would say, &quot;I don't know what it was. It
just seems like you were fascinated with that guy.&quot; And that was it.
He surprised me and bought me presents, candy, and flowers. I liked that.
When I was with him, I felt like I was the number one girl. Then I'd hear
about him and some other gal, or he wouldn't show up, and I'd just bawl.
Then he'd show up with a box of candy and I'd think he'd change. You always
think they're gonna change. After a while, you can't give it up.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He did stay sober at first. He was A.A. number four. That's how he got
into the <i>Big Book</i>, the first one. He was dropped in the second edition
because he started drinking again. He was boozing by the time we were married.
That was one reason Dad didn't like him. The other, of course, is that
Ernie double-crossed him. I've heard people say Dad always thought
Ernie was an S.O.B.; he was the only person Dad was ever heard to talk about
like that.<br>

<p>
Obviously, Doctor Bob was not a very good judge of character.
After Doctor Bob engineered the whole affair, and shoved Ernie Galbraith on his
daughter, Doctor Bob whimpered and complained that Ernie had &quot;double-crossed
him&quot; by plucking the ripe plum Susan.
<p>
Bill Wilson quietly removed Ernie G.'s story from the
<i>Big Book</i> in 1955, when the second edition was published,
but it took until 1965 for Sue to get divorced from Ernie.
Then, after Ray's first wife died, she finally married her high-school
sweetheart Ray Windows.<br>

<p>
<a name="ftnt07_ret"> </a>
And there is more, lots more, like the daughter of Susan and Ernie ended
up getting pregnant at 16, and then, several years later, killed herself
and her own young daughter with Ernie's shotgun in a double murder-suicide.
<p>
Dr. Bob's son, Robert Smith Jr., a.k.a. &quot;Smitty&quot;,
spent his life in and around A.A. and Al-Anon, yammering crazy platitudes,
trying to deal with his own
issues.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt07">7</a></sup></font>
One example of Smitty's neurotic mind-set is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I thought I was a very shallow person, because I didn't seem to be able
to love my fellow man. I could see a deeper love in other people than
I seemed to be able to have. I read a book that kind of set me on the
right track on that one. It said love is a learned phenomenon, you're
not born with it. And here's the catch, I think, for us &#8212; you have to
be willing to accept love, which I could never do.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All of this was taught to me slowly. I had a sponsor who interested me
in, and forced me into, the service end of it.
I learned then that everybody in the program is not perfect.
I learned they don't have to be perfect for you to love 'em or
even like 'em. Because when you start culling your friends,
accepting only the perfect ones, you're not going to have any friends.
I used to cull my friends, and if I found the slightest imperfection,
I would think I have to discard them. But now I seem to be able to
accept them like they are, warts and all, and present myself to other
people, warts and all. And boy, you can sure have a lot more friends
that way.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>&quot;Children of the Healer: The Story of
Dr. Bob's Kids As Told to Christine Brewer&quot;</i>, by Bob Smith
and Sue Smith Windows, page 157:
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That poor guy. His father, Doctor Bob, screwed him up so bad that he
was unable to feel or accept love.
<p>
And it is irrational, even insane, to expect everybody around you to be perfect,
or even to expect <i>any</i> of them to be perfect. (Such compulsive
perfectionism is characteristic of abused children.)
But you can't flip out and go to the opposite extreme either, and
give everybody &quot;unconditional love and complete acceptance&quot;.
If you don't set some standards, and cull your friends, then
you will end up with Jeffrey Dahmer, Theodore Bundy, and Rev. Jim Jones
for your circle of friends.
<p>

And then it seems that Bob Smith Jr. reported, in an Al-Anon speaker's tape,
that his own son
<a href="orange-letters13.html#Smith_suicide" target="_blank">also committed suicide</a>.
So two of Dr. Bob's grandchildren killed themselves, one while also murdering
Dr. Bob's great-granddaughter.
<p>
Neurosis, insanity, and tragedy ran rampant in the Smith family.

&#8212; they both needed their leader positions to compensate for
a very fragile sense of self-worth, self-esteem and
self-identity. They both had long histories of suicidally-intense alcohol
abuse.
They had both wrecked their own lives.
They were both members of another cult religion, The Oxford Group,
before they founded their own cult religion.
<p>
Bill Wilson was also an abused child &#8212; the son of an abusive alcoholic
father &#8212; and hence, &quot;an untreated Adult Child of an Alcoholic&quot;.

<p>
And Wilson was certainly a
&quot;<i>charismatic charmer</i> who could change personalities
in a flash.&quot;
Bill bragged about giving newcomers unconditional love and
complete acceptance, but he had a mean vindictive streak
in him, where he would turn on people, and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">condemn them to death
by alcohol for disagreeing with him</a> or criticizing him.

<p>
Both Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith fit the description of &quot;a disturbed guru&quot;.

<i>Disturbed Members, Mentally Ill Followers</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Pretty obviously, just for starters, most of the members were drinking
themselves to death before joining A.A.. That isn't normal, or healthy.
<p>
That isn't to say that every member of A.A. is mentally ill, far from
it. But there has to be something really wrong with someone's mind if he
really believes that a praying to a doorknob or a bedpan will restore him to sanity
and fix his alcohol problem. There has to be something wrong with his
logic if he thinks that an organization that promotes such nonsense
is okay, and is on the up-and-up.
And there has to be something wrong with his judgement if he falls
in love with it at first sight:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When we reached A.A., and for the first time in our lives stood
among people who seemed to understand, the sense of belonging was
tremendously exciting.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 57.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
There has to be something really wrong with his thinking if he buys
into the whole insane package of A.A. dogma.
He has to be at least a little nuts if he thinks that all of the
crazy and delusional things that are listed in the other Cult Test
items here are somehow all okay.

<p>
<font color="blue">
By the way, one of the reasons that the newcomer feels that he is among people who <i>really understand</i>
is because he is gettng
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">love bombed</a>&quot;.
The other A.A. members surround him and cheer for him and congratulate him for coming
and encourage him to keep coming back, and say that they are giving him &quot;unconditional love&quot;.
It's a standard cult recruiting technique.

<p>
One sage observer of the scene commented:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I see it as sort of like the victims of con artists. The
thing they all have in common that allows a con artist to get over is
that they are gullible and greedy. They want something for nothing,
amazing stock returns, pyramid schemes, etc., and they are gullible
enough to get swindled. Generally, I do not feel sorry for victims of
con artists. If it sounds too good to be true, it is. If it sounds
ridiculous, it probably is. If it sounds like hyperbole and
exaggeration, it probably is.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have also noted how angry so many of the &quot;old timers&quot; are.
I have observed that closely and concluded for myself that the problem
is that most people have a lot of grief in their lives and
in a way, AA is always focusing on losses. At the same time, there
is nowhere to go with grief as it isn't allowed. So the sadness gets
stuffed leaving only the anger to be dumped out in the
meeting, usually aimed at someone who isn't getting the program or
was foolish enough to tell the truth about their selfish life.
Notice that sometime. Old timers in AA are often an angry lot: a
mask of serenity with a seething cauldron underneath.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And there is no shortage of true believers who are ready to lash out
angrily and hatefully whenever anyone dares to criticize A.A. or
its beliefs. Many people are not interested in the truth at all.
Rather, they just want to hear some affirmation of their own beliefs &#8212; that is,
their own superstitions.
<p>
I regularly receive emails from true-believer A.A. members who
claim that I am wrong about something or other.
When I answer, showing them the evidence that supports my statements,
they simply ignore it and change the subject,
and complain about something else.
<a href="orange-letters4.html#mere_facts" target="_blank">
They simply will not allow
their opinions to be changed by mere facts</a>.
They are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">in denial</a>.
That is not good mental health, nor is it recovery,
nor is it a lifestyle of &quot;rigorous honesty.&quot;
That is a lifestyle of self-deception.

<p>
And then we should not ignore the failures in A.A. &#8212; those people who don't
quit drinking. There is something a bit off-base about people who can
week after week, month after month, come to A.A. meetings and listen to stories of horror and tragedy
caused by drinking alcohol, and then go out and drink some more alcohol.
That is certainly not good mental health, nor is it recovery.
After a certain point, you have to conclude that those people are nuts.

Michael Lemanski observed:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In AA, the bald assumption is that following &quot;the AA way
of life&quot; will inevitably &quot;restore [alcoholics] to
sanity.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But this is not necessarily true. In a research report called
<i>The Abstinent Alcoholic</i>, researchers Donald Gerard, Gerhart Saenger,
and Renee Wile analyzed the abstinent population. The study included
clients who had managed to achieve sobriety for up to nine years.
On the basis of their findings and case studies, they divided the
abstinent former alcoholics into four classifications:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Overtly Disturbed (54% of the total)
<li> Inconspicuously Inadequate Personalities (24%)
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous Successes (12%)
<li> Independent Successes (10%)
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The authors describe these groups as follows:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Times,Helvetica">

1. Overtly Disturbed ... These ex-patients suffer with tension
to a degree which concerns them; and/or they are angry, dissatisfied,
or are resentful., projecting aggressive attitudes or ideas into
their environment; and/or they are driven by anxiety so that they are
restless, unable to relax, seeking to distract or sedate themselves
from their conflicts by spending inordinate amounts of time at work
or social activities of a community nature; and/or they are overtly
psychiatrically ill, displaying disturbances of mood, thought, and
behavior to a psychotic degree.
<p>
2. Inconspicuously Inadequate Personalities consist of those
ex-patients whose total functioning is characterized by meagerness
of their involvement in life and living.... There is nothing grossly
&quot;wrong&quot; in their lives. They are not presently likely
to go to jail or to a mental hospital, nor are they very troubled.
On the other hand, there is no positive sense of excitement, purpose,
or interest in life. &nbsp; ...
<p>
3. AA Successes... It is evident that they are as dependent on AA
as they were before on alcohol. They are very active in AA. Some of
them spend all or practically all of their free time at AA or
in 12-Step work. Conversely, they have little or no social life
apart from AA....
<p>
4. Independent Successes... These ex-patients have achieved a state
of self-respecting independence, of personal growth, and self-realization.
They differ from the first subgroup in that they do not appear disturbed...;
they differ from the second subgroup in that they are more alive and
interesting as human beings...; and they differ from the third subgroup
in that their efforts at self-realization are independent rather than
institutionally supported....<font size="-1"><sup>25</sup></font><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It certainly appears that the AA promise that &quot;working the steps&quot;
(the centerpiece of 12-Step treatment) will make individuals
&quot;happily and usefully whole&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>26</sup></font>
was not fulfilled for the fully 90% of the individuals studied
who were &#8212; after treatment, and, presumably, continued
participation in AA &#8212; either overtly disturbed (54%), had
&quot;inadequate&quot; personalities (24%), or were
&quot;AA successes&quot; (12%).<br>

<i>Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and
dependency.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer listed this item as one of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">the five essential criteria</a> for
an effective <i>thought reform</i> or brainwashing program.
<p>
A.A. creates feelings of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt and dependency
in its victims in a variety of ways:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Step One says that members are powerless over alcohol, and unable to manage
their own lives.
<p>
<li> Step Two says that members are insane.
<p>
<li> Step Three says that members must turn over &#8212; surrender &#8212;
control of their lives and their
wills to &quot;God <i>as we understood Him</i>&quot;, who can be anything,
including the local <b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>runks.
<p>
<li> Step Four demands that members make lists of everything they ever did wrong
in their entire lives, and Step Five instructs members to confess that list to someone.
<p>
<li> Step Seven tells members to &quot;humbly&quot; beg God to
remove their &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;. It doesn't say anything about people healing themselves.
<p>
<li> Step Nine demands that members make another list of everyone they ever harmed or
offended, and then Step Ten tells them to go &quot;make amends&quot; by apologizing
and humbling themselves before everybody on the list.
<p>
<li> Step Eleven tells people to hear the Voice of God. If people don't hear God talking, then
they are inferior and failures again.
(As a defense against that feeling of failure, some people become delusional and imagine that every little noise
in their heads is the Voice of God talking to them.)

<p>
<li> A.A. tells newcomers that their thinking is defective, and their morality
is hopelessly flawed.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are selfish. Everything you do is just for yourself.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<li> A.A. also tells members that they cannot ever recover:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.&quot;</i>
</font>
You will allegedly always be a sinful
weak alcoholic, in imminent danger of relapsing and dying drunk in a
gutter unless you <i>Keep Coming Back</i> to A.A. meetings.

<li> A.A. makes demands for superhuman perfection.
A.A. members are supposed to feel lots of

Older members are supposed to feel unconditional love and complete
acceptance towards newcomers. Since members cannot meet these
super-human standards, they feel guilty and inadequate.

<li> A.A. decides whether people are good or bad, based on their
abstinence from alcohol, their &quot;working a strong program&quot;,
and their acceptance of Bill Wilson's religion.
<p>
<li> A.A. decides what &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; mean.<br>
The &quot;good&quot; A.A. member is somebody who attends lots of meetings,

&quot;works a strong program&quot;,
faithfully parrots the A.A. slogans and dogma, never questions or
criticizes Alcoholics Anonymous or its 12-Step program or its
obviously-wrong beliefs, and goes recruiting for more A.A. members...

<p>
<li> A.A. has an elitist world view. A.A. members are allegedly
<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html" target="_blank">more spiritual than other people</a>.
<p>
<li> A.A. dispenses conditional love and conditional approval to alcoholics,
in spite of its public claims of doing just the opposite.
Its &quot;love&quot; and approval depend, of course, on a person's
conformity to the group, sobriety, acceptance of the A.A. dogma as
&quot;the true spiritual principles&quot; and frequent meeting attendance.
<p>
<li> A.A. members often practice shunning and ostracism of those who quit Alcoholics Anonymous.
The drop-outs are declared to no longer be good people. (They may even be

When people refused to become true believers in a crazy cult religion,
Bill Wilson declared that they &quot;clung to their other defects&quot;.
You aren't a good &quot;spiritual&quot; person if you don't believe in

A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
This item is one of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">
Dr. Robert Jay Lifton's 8 and Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer's 5 Criteria for brainwashing or mind control</a> &#8212;
Doctrine Over Person &#8212; implement group doctrine over personal beliefs.
Past experiences and
values are invalid if they conflict with the new A.A. morality.
<p>
This item is pretty obvious, in that almost all members of A.A. and N.A.
are people who previously got into trouble with alcohol or drugs or both, so it is easy
to tell them that their former life was no good, and their thinking was no
good, so now they must live the 12-Step way or else their fate will be
<i>&quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot;</i>.

<p>
The slogan is
<i>&quot;Principles Before Personalities&quot;</i>, which means that cult dogma can
be used to trump anybody else's statements, facts, or beliefs.
Also,
<i>&quot;Look for the similarities, not the differences&quot;</i>, which means that you
should not notice the differences between what they are telling you, and what you know to
be true, because you  are seeing it with your own eyes, and have experienced it for yourself.

<p>
As a good A.A. member, you should:
<ul>
<li>
Believe what your sponsor and the other old-timers tell you,
rather than your own common sense and your own thinking
(because they say that your thinking is &quot;alcoholic&quot; and
&quot;your best thinking got you here&quot;).
<p>
<li> Believe that A.A. doctrines are correct, even if they seem contrary to
your own personal experiences, and even if they seem illogical, contradictory,
and nonsensical. (Newcomers who disagree with A.A. dogma are said to
be &quot;in denial&quot; and &quot;thinking alcoholically&quot;.)

<p>
<li> Believe that the Twelve Steps really do work to make people quit
drinking, or quit doing drugs, or quit being nagging wives, or quit
wanting sex, <a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">or whatever it is</a>...

<p>
<li> Believe it when they begin every meeting by incanting
<font color="7f00bf">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail,
who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;</font><br>

Ignore what your own eyes tell you &#8212; that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">A.A. has a terrible dropout rate</a>
&#8212; that most all of the newcomers soon leave.

<p>
<li> <a href="#abandon_reason" target="_blank">Abandon your own logical, rational mind
and &quot;Reason&quot;</a>, and just
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">have faith</a>&quot; in
the grandiose proclamations of Bill Wilson in the <i>Big Book</i>.
Your own beliefs and understanding of religion are irrelevant, as are the
opinions of most other preachers, theologians, ministers, doctors, and psychiatrists.<br>
<p>
<li> Believe that the founders or the old-timers of A.A. can see another, higher,
reality which you cannot yet see, because you don't have enough years of
<i>Time</i> (sober time in A.A., that is).

<p>
<li> Likewise, believe that the old-timers have knowledge and wisdom which
you do not have, so their judgement is better than yours.

<p>
<li> If Bill Wilson or Doctor Bob said something, then it is true because they said it.
Just ignore any and all facts to the contrary.
In no case can you cite your own experiences as evidence that Bill W. was wrong
about something.

Keep them unaware that there is an agenda to change them.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
This is one of Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer's
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">Five Essential Conditions</a>

<i>&quot;Keep them unaware
that there is an agenda to change them, and unaware of how they are

<p>
One of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">
Dr. Edgar H. Schein's essential conditions</a> for a brainwashing program is:<br>
<i>&quot;Keep the person unaware of what is going on and the changes
taking place.&quot;</i>



<p>
Bill Wilson described how Alcoholics Anonymous is just such a program:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terms &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and
&quot;spiritual awakening&quot; are used many times in this book
which, upon careful reading, shows that
the personality change sufficient to bring about
recovery from alcoholism has manifested itself among us in many
different forms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the
impression that
these personality changes, or
religious experiences,
must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals.
Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Most of our experiences are what the psychologist William James
[in his book <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>]
calls the &quot;educational variety&quot;
because they develop slowly over a period of time.
<font color="#9F0000">
Quite often friends of the newcomer
are aware of the difference long before he is himself.
</font>
He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in
his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been
brought about by himself alone.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Appendix II, &quot;Spiritual Experience&quot;, page 569.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, &quot;happily for everyone&quot;, the old-timers can see how the
A.A. program is slowly changing the newcomer's mind,
but the newcomer does not realize what they are doing to him until later.
According to Bill Wilson, the newcomer does not even realize when he
surrenders control of his will and his mind:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has,
<font color="#9F0000">without realizing it</font>,
made a beginning on Step Three. Isn't it true that, in all matters touching upon alcohol,
each of them has decided to turn his or her life over to the care, protection,
and guidance of A.A.?
Already a willingness has been achieved to cast out one's own will and one's own ideas
about the alcohol problem in favor of those suggested by A.A.
Any willing newcomer feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the foundering vessel
he has become. Now if this is not turning one's will and life over to a newfound
Providence, then what is it?<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had
restored us to sanity and had enabled us
to live with some peace of mind in a sorely
troubled world, then such a Higher Power
was worth knowing better, by as
direct contact as possible. The persistent use of
meditation and prayer, we found, did open the channel so
that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river
which led to sure power and safe guidance from God as we
were increasingly better able to understand Him.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question.
<font color="#9F0000">
Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubting themselves,
the rest of us were able to see the change setting in.
</font>
<a name="group_power"> </a>
From great numbers of such
experiences, we could predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 108-109.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note the hidden agenda: The newcomer may have joined A.A. because
he had a drinking problem for which he was seeking help, but Bill Wilson's
ulterior motive was to convert him to Bill's religion &#8212;
to make him &quot;love God and call Him by name.&quot;
The truth about that hidden agenda, and the truth about the real nature
of the A.A. program, were only doled out to the newcomers
<a href="#teaspoons" target="_blank"><i>&quot;by teaspoons, not buckets&quot;</i></a>
because the condescending Bill Wilson felt that &quot;they didn't want
to get too good too soon.&quot;

<p>
And this line is rather disturbing:<br>
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubting
themselves, the rest of us were able to see the change setting in.&quot;<br>
</font>

Bill Wilson says that the beginners will not be able to see the
&quot;change setting in&quot;, but the elders will.
So the newcomers will not be aware of how the indoctrination
and the Twelve-Step program is changing them and affecting
their minds, bringing them to the point where they will be
ready to &quot;love God and call Him by name&quot;, but the
elders will know what is going on.
<p>
That sounds like brainwashing. The least that you can call it
is the underhanded disguised religious conversion of the newcomers
by the old-timers. (Yes, religious conversion done by this
organization that claims that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">it isn't a religion</a> and
it doesn't do religious conversions.)

<a name="slogan_list"> </a>
A.A. has so many slogans and thought-stopping clich&eacute;s that I can
only paraphrase the Bible:
<i>&quot;Our name is Legion, for we are so many.&quot;</i>
Alcoholics Anonymous has to be the world's champion for slogans;
I just cannot think of any other cult or organization that has
more slogans.
<p>
Many of the A.A. slogans contradict each other, so you can sometimes
quote an A.A. slogan for whichever side of an issue you wish to promote.
Also notice how many of them are negative, and condescending or demeaning
to the newcomer alcoholics. That helps in the cult conversion process,
breaking down the minds and wills of newcomers.

<li> &quot;The elevator is broken &#8212; use the Steps.&quot;
<li> &quot;You don't have to wait till the basement to get off the down elevator.&quot;
<li> &quot;The AA waltz: steps 1, 2, 3.&quot;
<li> &quot;The steps: Give up (1,2,3) Clean up (4,5,6) Make up (7,8, 9) Keep up (10,11,12).&quot;
<li> &quot;The 12 steps: Clear up (1,2,3), Clean up (4,5,6,7,8,9), Group up: (10,11,12).&quot;
<li> &quot;There are 12 steps in the ladder of complete sobriety.&quot;
<li> &quot;The easier softer way is one through twelve.&quot;
<li> &quot;There's safety in numbers. One through twelve.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. is the easier, softer way.&quot;
<li> &quot;No one can take credit for their own sobriety any more than a drowning person can take credit for grasping a life preserver. Nor can anyone take credit for another person's sobriety any more than the person throwing a life preserver to a drowning person can take credit that it floats.&quot;
<li> &quot;Our worst day in sobriety is better than our best day drinking.&quot;
<li> &quot;Sobriety is a gift, the price of which is eternal vigilance.&quot;

<li> &quot;If it did not work for you, then you did not work the Steps right.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Steps don't work to make you quit drinking; you must quit drinking to work the Steps.&quot;

<li> &quot;Fear alone won't keep me sober, but for a newcomer, it's not a bad place to start.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. can't prevent a relapse but it can ruin one.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. spoils your drinking.&quot;
<li> &quot;First we stayed sober because we have to... then we stay sober because we are willing to... then we stay sober because we want to.&quot;
<li> &quot;Every recovery from alcoholism began with one sober hour.&quot;

<li> &quot;Stick With the Winners.&quot;

<li> &quot;If AA uses brainwashing, then our brains must need to be washed.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. is not a cult; people who come here need their brains washed.&quot;
<li> &quot;No Pain... No Gain.&quot;

<li> &quot;Short version of the Serenity Prayer: Lighten up.&quot;
<li> &quot;You know you are sharing a feeling when you do not need a reply.&quot;

<li> &quot;Rule 62: Don't take yourself so seriously.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stop living in the problem and start living in the answer.&quot;
<font size="-1">(BB, 3rd ed., p. 449.)</font>
<li> &quot;I don't care who has a problem. What I want to know is, who has the solution?&quot;
<li> &quot;Be part of the solution, not the problem.&quot;
<li> &quot;I pray to God every day that I never get the idea that I can run my own life.&quot;
<li> &quot;Please be patient &#8212; God isn't finished with me yet.&quot;
<li> &quot;I know I'm in trouble when I start thinking I can run my own life.&quot;
<li> &quot;It is insane to keep on doing the same old things you've always been doing, and expect to get different results.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't leave five minutes before the miracle.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't quit before the miracle happens.&quot;
<li> &quot;It gets better.&quot;

<li> &quot;Only another alcoholic will understand.&quot;
<li> &quot;Nobody can understand an alcoholic better than another alcoholic.&quot;
<li> &quot;You can always tell an alcoholic, but you can't tell him much.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you wonder if you're an alcoholic, you probably are.&quot;
<li> &quot;Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.&quot;
<li> &quot;Today there's still a monkey on my back. He's just sleeping. He's real easy to wake up.&quot;
<li> &quot;Instant ass-hole, just add alcohol.&quot;
<li> &quot;I didn't get into trouble every time I drank, but every time I got in trouble I was drunk.&quot;
<li> &quot;When I drank, I was committing suicide on the installment plan.&quot;
<li> &quot;Alcoholism is the only disease that tells you you're all right.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's a disease of perception.&quot;
<li> &quot;We have a disease that tells us we don't have a disease.&quot;

<li> &quot;If you stick with the bunch, you'll get peeled.&quot;
<li> &quot;You have to go to these meetings until you want to.&quot;
<li> &quot;Go to meetings when you want to, and go to meetings when you don’t want to.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's been a good meeting so far.&quot;
<li> &quot;Seven days without an A.A. meeting makes one weak.&quot;
<li> &quot;There are two days in every week which we have no control over &#8212; yesterday and tomorrow. Today is the only day we can change.&quot;
<li> &quot;It is not the experience of today that drives people mad, it is remorse of yesterday and the dread of tomorrow.&quot;
<li> &quot;Yesterday is a cancelled check, tomorrow is a promissory note, only today is cash in the bank.&quot;
<li> &quot;I have the Golden Ticket.&quot;
<li> &quot;We have been given the Keys to the Kingdom.&quot;
<li> &quot;The first drink gets you drunk.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are without defense against the first drink, our defense must come from a power greater than ourselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;How important is it?&quot;
<li> &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up, and Learn Something.&quot;
<li> &quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and stick it in your mouth.&quot;
<li> &quot;Before engaging your mouth, put your mind in gear.&quot;
<li> &quot;Listen and Learn.&quot;
<li> &quot;Listen like only the dying can.&quot;
<li> &quot;Before I got into A.A., I was dying for a drink.&quot;
<li> &quot;All I know is, it worked for me.&quot;
<li> &quot;You are in denial.&quot;
<li> &quot;When we think we are in control of our own lives we are living in denial.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's paradoxical.&quot;
<li> &quot;A man's intelligence is measured by how many contradictions he can withstand.&quot;
<li> &quot;You cannot dry todays washing with yesterday's wind.&quot;
<li> &quot;Every day is a gift. That's why we call it the present.&quot;
<li> &quot;Quitting isn't an option for addicts like us.&quot;
<li> &quot;Alcoholics can't afford to have resentments.&quot;
<li> &quot;You have a resentment.&quot;
<li> &quot;The road to resentment is paved with expectation.&quot;
<li> &quot;The flip side to forgiveness is resentments.&quot;
<li> &quot;Try to be grateful and resentful at the same time, you can't serve two masters.&quot;
<li> &quot;Write a gratitude list and count your blessings.&quot;
<li> &quot;Skid Row is a place in my mind &#8212; not a place on the street.&quot;
<li> &quot;Progress, Not Perfection.&quot;
<li> &quot;We can do what I can't.&quot;
<li> &quot;You're not alone anymore.&quot;
<li> &quot;First Things First.&quot;
<li> &quot;Poor me, poor me, pour me another drink.&quot;
<li> &quot;Nobody is ever too dumb to get the program, but some people are too intelligent.&quot;
<li> &quot;There are none too dumb for the A.A. program but many are too smart.&quot;
<li> &quot;You are too smart for your own good.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Steps are numbered for the intellectual.&quot;
<a name="opinions"> </a>
<li> &quot;Never say 'no' to the program.&quot;
<li> &quot;This is a selfish program.&quot;
<li> &quot;When my insides match my outside, I'm practicing a good program.&quot;
<li> &quot;It isn't the load that weighs us down &#8212; it's the way we carry it.&quot;
<li> &quot;In A.A. we don't carry the alcoholic; we carry the message.&quot;
<li> &quot;You can carry the message but not the alcoholic.&quot;
<li> &quot;Today I soak up A.A. the way I used to soak up alcohol.&quot;
<li> &quot;Life starts when you stop.&quot;
<li> &quot;This program isn't for people who need it, it's for people who want it.&quot;
<li> &quot;AA is not for people who want it or for people who need it... it is for people who do it!&quot;

<li> &quot;Opinions are like ass-holes &#8212; everybody's got one, and most of them stink.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you point a finger at someone, you will find three pointed back at you.&quot;
<li> &quot;When you point a finger at someone else, there are three pointed back at you.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't point a finger; point the whole hand (reach out).&quot;
<li> &quot;AA has no leaders and no one can speak for AA.&quot;
<li> &quot;How does one become an old-timer? Don't drink and don't die.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. may not solve all your problems but it is willing to share them.&quot;
<li> &quot;Sorrow shared is halved; joy shared is doubled.&quot;
<li> &quot;Three suggestions for making an A.A. speech: 1) be interesting 2) be brief 3) be seated.&quot;
<li> &quot;Acceptance is the answer to all of your problems today.&quot;
<li> &quot;Acceptance: experience is what you get when you don't get what you want.&quot;
<li> &quot;Acceptance: Stop barking and start biting.&quot;
<li> &quot;Accept your admission.&quot;
<li> &quot;Get On Your Knees.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you don't bend your knees, you'll bend your elbow.&quot;
<li> &quot;Bend your knees before you bend your elbow.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. is about finding God.&quot;
<li> &quot;We had to quit playing God.&quot;
<li> &quot;If God is your co-pilot, switch seats.&quot;
<li> &quot;There are no atheists in foxholes.&quot;
<li> &quot;There are no coincidences in A.A.&quot;
<li> &quot;A coincidence is a miracle in which God chooses to remain anonymous.&quot;
<li> &quot;The will of God will never take you where the grace of God will not protect you.&quot;
<li> &quot;When we surrender to our higher power, the journey begins.&quot;
<li> &quot;God taught us to laugh again but God please don't let us forget that we once cried.&quot;
<li> &quot;Let it begin with me.&quot;
<li> &quot;Get out of the driver's seat.......let go and let god.&quot;
<li> &quot;Get humble.&quot;
<li> &quot;You can't save your face and your ass at the same time.&quot;
<li> &quot;We didn't fly into A.A. on the wings of victory.&quot;
<li> &quot;None of us came here on a winning streak.&quot;
<li> &quot;None of us got here from drinking too much coffee.&quot;
<li> &quot;I did my drinking from Park Avenue to park bench.&quot;
<li> &quot;An A.A. meeting is where losers get together to talk about their winnings.&quot;
<li> &quot;A winner is a loser who keeps trying.&quot;
<li> &quot;It's easy to talk the talk, but you have to walk the walk.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. is a school in which we are all learners and all teachers.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no such thing as a bad meeting.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. has a wrench to fit every nut that walks through the door.&quot; (<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea" target="_blank"><i>We Have The Panacea</i></a>.)
<li> &quot;The doors swing both ways.&quot;
<li> &quot;Each and every alcoholic, sober or not, teaches us valuable lessons about ourselves and recovery.&quot;
<li> &quot;The definition of an alcoholic; an egomaniac with an inferiority complex.&quot;
<li> &quot;Cunning, baffling, powerful, and patient.&quot;
<li> &quot;The time to attend a meeting is when you least feel like going.&quot;
<li> &quot;Get to the meeting early and go to the meeting after the meeting.&quot;
<li> &quot;If your ass falls off, put it in a paper bag and take it to a meeting.&quot;
<li> &quot;20/20: Come 20 minutes before the meeting, stay 20 minutes after.&quot;

<li> &quot;Alcoholics heal from the outside in, but feel from the inside out.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you want to hide something from an alcoholic, hide it in the <i>Big Book</i>, because that's where he'll never find it.&quot;
<li> &quot;Ask an alcoholic what time it is and he'll tell you how to build a clock.&quot;
<li> &quot;Fear is the absence of faith.&quot;
<li> &quot;Courage is faith that has said its prayers.&quot;
<li> &quot;Fear is the darkroom where negatives are developed.&quot;
<li> &quot;We can be positive that our drinking was negative.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stop fighting everyone.&quot;
<li> &quot;Keep an open mind.&quot;
<li> &quot;We have given up fighting anybody or anything.&quot;
<li> &quot;People who leave just want to drink.&quot;
<li> &quot;We realize we know only a little.&quot; <font size="-1">(<i>Big Book</i>, page 164.)</font>
<li> &quot;We're the experts on addiction.&quot;
<li> &quot;I've drunk more alcohol than you've pissed.&quot;
<li> &quot;Untreated alcoholism KILLS, with or without a drink.&quot;
<li> &quot;Remember that alcoholism is incurable, progressive, and fatal.&quot;
<li> &quot;The first step is the only step a person can work perfectly.&quot;
<li> &quot;The journey of 1,000 miles begins with the first step.&quot;
<li> &quot;If a candidate for A.A. is ready, you can't say anything wrong; if he's not ready, you can't say anything right.&quot;
<li> &quot;Step One only works when you do the other eleven.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you quit one day at a time, every day that you don't drink will be an accomplishment. If you quit forever, you won't have accomplished anything until you're dead.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you want to drink, that is your business... If you want to quit and can't, that is A.A.'s business.&quot;
<li> &quot;I get what I need and inevitably find out it was what I wanted all the time.&quot;
<li> &quot;I want what I want when I want it.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. tells us that our lives can be better.&quot;
<li> &quot;When I start wondering if everything's okay, it's probably not.&quot;
<li> &quot;It takes time.&quot;
<li> &quot;It takes time to get your brains out of hock.&quot;
<li> &quot;Time wasted in getting even can never be used in getting ahead.&quot;
<li> &quot;If I take a drink, I take my life back.&quot;
<li> &quot;Do what you can, let go of what you can't, and leave the results to a higher power.&quot;
<li> &quot;The results are in God's hands.&quot;
<li> &quot;If I take a drink, I take my life back.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you have a problem believing in God, go to an A.A. meeting and you'll see miracle, after miracle, after miracle. Seeing is believing.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no magic in recovery only miracles.&quot;
<li> &quot;Let it go, it was never yours to begin with.&quot;
<li> &quot;Just trust and surrender that's all you really need to do.&quot;
<li> &quot;The third step is the Swiss Army knife of the steps: it helps you do everything.&quot;
<li> &quot;Nothing pushed down inside of us stays down for very long.&quot;
<li> &quot;Put down the magnifying glass you use to look at others and look in the mirror.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't take someone else's inventory.&quot;
<li> &quot;When you're taking someone else's inventory, who's taking yours?&quot;
<li> &quot;Taking others' inventory: You spot it, you got it.&quot;
<li> &quot;Taking others' inventory (when you should be taking your own).&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't just take an inventory; let it take you.&quot;
<li> &quot;Take other people's inventory until you can take your own.&quot;
<li> &quot;Uncover to recover.&quot;
<li> &quot;As the unexamined life is not worth living, the unlived life is not worth examining.&quot;
<li> &quot;Conquer yourself rather than the world.&quot;
<li> &quot;Keep your own side of the street clean.&quot;
<li> &quot;Most alcoholics who quit A.A. will drink again unless they remember where they came from.&quot;
<li> &quot;Every drink I drank got me here. Every drink I don't drink keeps me here.&quot;
<li> &quot;Active alcoholics don't have relationships; they take hostages.&quot;
<li> &quot;If we don't remember our last drunk, maybe we haven't had it yet.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you can't remember your last drink, maybe you haven't had it.&quot;
<li> &quot;We all have another drunk left in us but we don't know if we have another recovery in us.&quot;
<li> &quot;I might have another drunk left in me, but do I have another recovery?&quot;
<li> &quot;Anyone wanting to leave should take a close look at their motivation.&quot;
<li> &quot;You never hear someone coming back telling you it got better.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A.'s like the Mafia &#8212; If you leave it, you die.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no mistake so great as that of being always right.&quot;
<li> &quot;Keep on trudgin'.&quot;
<li> &quot;To practice Step 5 is to share at a meeting.&quot;
<li> &quot;Be a channel not a dam. If you pass, it's your ass.&quot;
<li> &quot;Give to God and God will give to you.&quot;
<li> &quot;The only thing we take from this world when we leave is what we gave away.&quot;
<li> &quot;The key to step 6 is acceptance &#8212; accepting character defects exactly as they are and becoming entirely willing to let them go.&quot;
<li> &quot;Part of compliance is defiance, but you must arrive at acceptance of the disease.&quot;
<li> &quot;Treatment of a disease doesn't always feel good.&quot;
<li> &quot;Change only happens when the pain of holding on is greater than the fear of letting go.&quot;
<li> &quot;When the pain of staying sober becomes less than the pain of getting drunk, you'll stay sober.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you want to stay sober, make the coffee.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stand by the coffee pots. It's a good way to meet people.&quot;
<li> &quot;I didn't get sober to be miserable.&quot;
<li> &quot;Do what you don't want to do.&quot;
<li> &quot;No pain, no gain.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is pain in recovery. Misery is optional.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you fly with crows, you get shot at.&quot;
<li> &quot;Willpower = our willingness to use a Higher Power.&quot;
<li> &quot;Dating is pouring Miracle Gro on my character defects.&quot;
<li> &quot;Tighten up (financially).&quot;
<li> &quot;If you want to feel better right away, ask God to help you be of service.&quot;
<li> &quot;To be of maximum service to others.&quot;
<li> &quot;Unity, recovery, and service.&quot;
<li> &quot;The smartest thing an A.A. member can say is, help.&quot;
<li> &quot;When I ask for patience, God gives me a traffic jam.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you pray for honesty, the chances of your lying go 'way up.&quot;
<li> &quot;Trying to pray is praying.&quot;
<li> &quot;Be careful what you pray for; you're liable to get it.&quot;
<li> &quot;When God closes one door, he always opens another &#8212; but sometimes he makes us wait out in the hallway for a while.&quot;
<li> &quot;God could and would if He were sought.&quot;
<li> &quot;Step 7: Humility: the spiritual focus is humility asking a higher power to do something that cannot be done by self-will or mere determination.&quot;
<li> &quot;Get humble or be made humble.&quot;
<li> &quot;Unless one attains some degree of humility, one is condemned to drink.&quot;
<li> &quot;Humility is the soil in which all other virtues grow.&quot;
<li> &quot;Humility is that virtue which reduces a man to the proper size without degrading him, thereby increasing him in stature without inflating him.&quot;
<li> &quot;Humility is like a venereal disease. If you have it, you don't talk about it.&quot;
<li> &quot;Humility is our acceptance of ourselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;Those who anger you, conquer you.&quot;
<li> &quot;Depression is anger toward inward.&quot;
<li> &quot;Love is less a feeling than a thousand tiny acts of kindness.&quot;
<li> &quot;To open oneself up to love, is to open oneself up to loss.&quot;
<li> &quot;We'll love you, until you learn to love yourself.&quot;
<li> &quot;Let us love you, until you can learn to love yourself.&quot;
<li> &quot;Remember that you may not like us, but you will love us in a very special way.&quot;
<li> &quot;I love you, God loves you, and there's nothing you can do about it.&quot;
<li> &quot;The victims of alcoholism are those around us.&quot;
<li> &quot;There are no victims, only volunteers.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you stop treating yourself poorly, it will become unacceptable for others to do so.&quot;
<li> &quot;When you run out of quarters for your ass-kicking machine, I've got an extra roll for you to use.&quot;
<li> &quot;Forgiveness of others is a gift to yourself.&quot;
<li> &quot;The number one way to relieve pain is to forgive.&quot;
<li> &quot;Going to any length means forgiving the person who has injured you the most.&quot;
<li> &quot;To be forgiven we must forgive.&quot;
<li> &quot;When I demand justice, I'd better think of the consequences.&quot;
<li> &quot;Nobody likes to admit to being wrong. But it is absolutely necessary to maintain spiritual progress in recovery.&quot;
<li> &quot;Why recovery never ends: the disease is alcoholism, not alcoholWASm.&quot;
<li> &quot;BE a human being not a human doing.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't know, just be.&quot;
<li> &quot;What will be will appear.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you only pray when you need something fixed, you're turning God into a repairman.&quot;
<li> &quot;Praying is asking God for help, meditating is listening for God's answer.&quot;
<li> &quot;We don't pray to change things; we pray to change us.&quot;
<li> &quot;If nothing changes, nothing changes.&quot;
<li> &quot;Prayer is not a device for getting my own way, but rather a means to become what I should be.&quot;
<li> &quot;All you have to change is everything.&quot;
<li> &quot;Daily Meditation for about 20 minutes is recommended for all in recovery; unless of course, you are very busy &#8212; then you should meditate for an hour.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you are too busy to pray, you are too busy.&quot;
<li> &quot;When you find yourself in a hurry, Stop and Recall the real ASAP: Always Say A Prayer.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you are having trouble getting on your knees to pray in the morning, put your shoes under the middle of the bed the night before.&quot;
<li> &quot;God answers &quot;knee mails&quot;&quot;
<li> &quot;Backsliding begins when knee-bending ends.&quot;
<li> &quot;Faith is our greatest gift; sharing it with others our greatest responsibility &quot;
<li> &quot;Faith chases away fear.&quot;
<li> &quot;Faith without works is dead.&quot;
<li> &quot;What is God's Will for me today?&quot;
<li> &quot;If it is meant to be, I can't stop it. If it isn't God's will, I can't make it happen.&quot;
<li> &quot;I don't always know what God's will is for me, but I always know what it's not.&quot;
<li> &quot;Pray as if everything depended on God; work as if everything depends on ourselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;No person can spend more on good works than they earn in meditation.&quot;
<li> &quot;There are A.A. members who make things happen there are A.A. members who watch things happen there are A.A. members who DON'T KNOW anything happened.&quot;
<li> &quot;A day without prayer is a day unfulfilled.&quot;
<li> &quot;A day hemmed in prayer is less likely to unravel.&quot;
<li> &quot;Focus plus Courage plus Willingness to Learn equals Miracles.&quot;
<li> &quot;Practice these principles in all your affairs &#8212; or change your affairs.&quot;
<li> &quot;Trust in God, clean house, and work with others.&quot;
<li> &quot;Service: Shut up, show up and say yes.&quot;
<li> &quot;Service is gratitude in action.&quot;
<li> &quot;The greatest gift that can come to anybody is a spiritual awakening.&quot;
<li> &quot;Awakening into sober usefulness.&quot;
<li> &quot;AA leads us to God, and God leads us to ourselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;Are you a human being having a spiritual experience? Or a spiritual being having a human experience?&quot;
<li> &quot;We are not human beings having spiritual experiences; we are spiritual beings having human experiences.&quot;
<li> &quot;Carry the message, not the mess.&quot;
<li> &quot;The message is under the ashtray.&quot;
<li> &quot;The message is up front.&quot;
<li> &quot;Some of us get so spiritual; we are of no earthly value to anyone.&quot;
<li> &quot;The more you have on the inside, the less you need on the outside.&quot;
<li> &quot;How we treat others is a consequence of the depth of our own spirituality.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are hardest to love when we need love most.&quot;
<li> &quot;When I am working with a drunk, sometimes the drunk I'm working on is me.&quot;
<li> &quot;A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.&quot;
<li> &quot;Only in giving do we receive in full measure.&quot;
<li> &quot;Be where you are supposed to be, do what you are supposed to do, when you are supposed to do it.&quot;
<li> &quot;I can only help another to the degree that I've been helped myself.&quot;
<li> &quot;When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want the hand of AA always to be there: and for that, I am responsible.&quot;
<li> &quot;We're responsible for the effort not the outcome.&quot;
<li> &quot;Helping people help themselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;Spirituality is the ability to get our minds off ourselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;Program bumper stickers belong on the dashboard, not the bumper.&quot;
<li> &quot;The slogans are wisdom written in shorthand.&quot;
<li> &quot;Chapter five (<i>Big Book</i>) is called 'how it works', not 'why me?'.&quot;
<li> &quot;The shortest sentence in the big book is, 'It Works.'&quot;
<li> &quot;You don't need the latest self-improvement bestseller. You have the classic in your hands. (The '<i>Big Book</i>')&quot;
<li> &quot;Prevent truth decay &#8212; read your <i>Big Book</i>.&quot;
<li> &quot;When you re-read the <i>Big Book</i>, you do not see more than you did before.  You see more in you than was there before.&quot;
<li> &quot;Read your <i>Big Book</i> every day, but try reading only the black parts.&quot;
<li> &quot;One of those rare books that gets smarter every time I read it.&quot;
<li> &quot;The reason I keep going to meetings is because the <i>Big Book</i> has no pictures in it.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you want to hide something from an alcoholic, hide it in the <i>Big Book</i>, because that is where he will never find it.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Law of Oversell:  When putting cheese in a mousetrap, always leave room for the mouse.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Law of Reality: Never get into fights with ugly people, they have nothing to lose.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Law of Self Sacrifice: When you starve with a tiger, the tiger starves last.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Law of Drunkenness: You can't fall off the floor.&quot;
<li> &quot;Make no major changes in the first year.&quot;
<li> &quot;No relationships in the first year.&quot;
<li> &quot;Two sickies don't make a wellie.&quot;
<li> &quot;Sober 'n Crazy.&quot;
<li> &quot;Reality is for people who can't handle drugs.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't Quit &#8212; Surrender.&quot;
<li> &quot;He's taking a geographic.&quot;
<li> &quot;At first you come because you have to come, but later you come because you love to come.&quot;
<li> &quot;This Is A Selfish Program.&quot;
<li> &quot;Let us love you until you can love yourself.&quot;
<li> &quot;The sicker you are the more we love you.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you call me when you're sober I'll show you how much I love you. If you call me when you're drunk I'll show you how much I love ME.&quot;
<li> &quot;AA is a place for sick people to get well.&quot;
<li> &quot;A.A. is an education without graduation.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are not bad people becoming good, but sick people becoming well.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are not bad people trying to get good, we are sick people trying to get well.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are sick people trying to get well, not bad people trying to get good.&quot;
<li> &quot;My sponsor says I'm trying. Very trying.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are not saints.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are not reformed drunks &#8212; but informed alcoholics.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you sober up a horse thief all you have is a sober horse thief.&quot;
<li> &quot;We are not different from others, God just made us special.&quot;
<li> &quot;We A.A.'s are 'gifted' people.&quot;

<li> &quot;No matter how far down the scale you've gone, you are welcome in AA.&quot;
<li> &quot;One alcoholic talking to another one equals one.&quot;
<li> &quot;Service is about being at meetings to chair, share and get out of ourselves.&quot;
<li> &quot;When you do all the talking you only learn what you already know.&quot;
<li> &quot;The Miracle of Healing that is God's Gift &#8212; Recovery.&quot;
<li> &quot;All of us have to ask ourselves about the GOD idea... Either he is the all-knowing master of time, space and dimension... or there is a lot of random chance in our lives and universe.&quot;
<li> &quot;Happy, joyous and free.&quot;
<li> &quot;He suffers from terminal uniqueness.&quot;
<li> &quot;I am unique, just like everybody else.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you hang around the barber shop enough, you will end up getting a hair cut.&quot;
<li> &quot;Who you see here, what you hear here, let it stay here.&quot;
<li> &quot;What you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, let it stay here.&quot;
<li> &quot;What you hear and see here, stays here.&quot;
<li> &quot;Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no chemical solution to a spiritual problem.&quot;
<li> &quot;Today I have more solutions than problems.&quot;
<li> &quot;Some must die so that others can live.&quot;
<li> &quot;We can only keep that which we give away.&quot; (Meaning: recruit new members for the cult, and indoctrinate them.)
<li> &quot;You have to give it away in order to keep it.&quot;
<li> &quot;Get it &#8212; give it &#8212; grow in it.&quot;
<li> &quot;If we don't grow, we gotta go.&quot;
<li> &quot;Freely giving what was freely given to us...&quot; (Meaning: recruit as we were recruited; indoctrinate them as we were indoctrinated.)
<li> &quot;You received without cost, now give without charge.&quot;
<li> &quot;In a bar, we got sympathy &#8212; as long as our money lasted. In A.A., we get understanding for nothing.&quot;
<li> &quot;He's a bleeding deacon&quot; (He's an unhappy old-timer).

<i>Mystical Manipulation</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
<p>
Cults routinely practice the engineering of experiences.
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Dr. Robert J. Lifton</a> called it
<i>Mystical Manipulation</i>, and described it as,
<p>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li> Everyone is manipulating everyone, under the belief that it advances
the &quot;ultimate purpose&quot;.
<li> Experiences are engineered to appear
to be spontaneous, when, in fact, they are contrived to have a deliberate
effect.
<li> People mistakenly attribute their experiences to spiritual
causes when, in fact, they are concocted by human beings.<br>
<font color="black" size="-1"><i>Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism</i>,
by Robert Jay Lifton, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc., 1963.</font>
</ul>
</font>
<p>
Mystical manipulation is also the perception of coincidental
or inevitable events as spiritual signs. Recruits are taught that
such signs reveal the greatness of the group.

<p>
A.A. does that constantly. How it works is:
<ul>
<li> You feel worse and worse as you do your Fourth Step, making long
lists of all of your sins, defects, wrongs, and moral shortcomings.<br>
<li> You feel guilty and inadequate.<br>
<li> The pressure and anxiety builds up inside of you.<br>
<li> Then you do your Fifth Step, and break down and confess everything to someone else.<br>
<li> When it is over, the sudden release of tension feels good.<br>
<li> You are relieved that it is finally over.<br>
<li> You mistakenly interpret that feeling of immense relief as a spiritual experience,
and you imagine that you have been relieved of your sins.
</ul>
<p>
Then A.A. members are taught to watch for coincidences, and to interpret coincidences
as <i>signs</i>.
<p>
In addition, A.A. members routinely claim that the benefits of sobriety are
caused by supernatual forces, which they are not.
Any time someone quits killing himself with alcohol
and starts eating better, he will feel better &#8212; a lot better.
(And also quitting smoking can make things <i>really</i> good, really fast.)
After several
months of sobriety, which gives the brain time to heal some of the damage from alcohol,
the ex-drinker will experience sudden rushes of energy, clarity, and
heightened awareness. A.A. members are wont to claim that these experiences are
&quot;spiritual experiences&quot; or &quot;spiritual awakenings&quot;,
caused by God, rather than the simple, natural result of recovery from alcoholism.

<i>The guru or the group demands ultra-loyalty and total
commitment.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson instructs the A.A. recruiters
to pressure prospective new members to write blank checks to A.A. &#8212;
to get them to agree in advance to do <i>absolutely anything</i>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... let his family or a friend ask him if he wants to quit for good and
if he would go to
<font color="#9F0000">any extreme</font> to do so.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then A.A. says that members can
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_graduates" target="_blank">never graduate</a>
from the program, and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_exit" target="_blank">they can never leave</a>.
They must continue to go to meetings and <i>Work The Steps</i>
for the rest of their lives. They must be willing to go to <i>any length</i>
to get &quot;sobriety&quot; &#8212; <i>&quot;half measures availed us nothing.&quot;</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to
<font color="#9F0000">any length</font>
to get it &#8212; then you are ready to take certain steps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier, softer way.
But we could not. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#9F0000">Half measures availed us nothing.</font>
We stood at the turning point.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>&quot;How It Works&quot;</i>, pages 58-59.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

The A.A. old-timers sneer at the newcomers who only want to quit drinking
and do not wish to devote their lives to a cult religion &#8212; the old-timers call them
<i>&quot;one-steppers&quot;</i>. (Bill Wilson was twice as generous &#8212; he
called them
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#two_stepper" target="_blank">two-steppers</a>&quot;</i>.)

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> actually declares that Alcoholics Anonymous must
come before <i>everything else</i> in a member's life, including
job, wife, and children &#8212; it's really <i>The Only Thing</i> that matters:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We all had to place recovery above everything...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, Henry Parkhurst, Chapter 10, <i>To Employers</i>, page 143.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="before_family"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I decided I must
place this program above everything else, even my family, because if I
did not maintain my sobriety I would lose my family anyway.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition &#8212; Chapter B10, <i>He Sold Himself Short</i>, page 293.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And a rehash of the <i>Big Book</i> that is intended for youths tells a story
of a supposedly-successful recovery where...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Even after she remarries, she doesn't lose sight of her priorities.
She places God first and A.A. second. Her husband is never more than the third most
important aspect of her life.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Big Book Unplugged; A Young Person's Guide to Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
John R., page 107.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="spiritual_progress"> </a>
Bill Wilson also declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Although financial recovery is on the way for many of us,
we found we could not place money first. For
us, material well-being always followed spiritual
progress; it never preceded.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson, Chapter 9, page 127.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So A.A. comes before job and career, and even marriage.
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Note how Bill Wilson often
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritual_growth" target="_blank">equated involvement
with A.A. and &quot;spiritual progress&quot;</a>.
He also equated A.A. activities with &quot;recovery&quot;.
They aren't the same things at all.
That's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#equality" target="_blank">another propaganda trick,
<i>&quot;False Equality&quot;</i></a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
And, Bill says, you must busy yourself with A.A. activities every day,
even to the point of neglecting your family:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Helping others is the foundation stone of your recovery.
A kindly act once in a while isn't enough.
You have to act the Good Samaritan every day, if need be.<br>
...<br>
Your wife may sometimes say she is neglected.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
Chapter 7,
<i>Working With Others</i>, page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Note that &quot;helping others&quot; is a euphemism &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">cult-speak</a> &#8212; for recruiting and
indoctrinating new A.A. members. Alcoholics Anonymous has an official policy of
<i>NOT</i> engaging in any service work or charity, and not helping alcoholics in any way
except for pressuring them to join Alcoholics Anonymous, because:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 98.</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
And a common A.A. slogan declares,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If I don't feel like going to a meeting, I usually NEED to.&quot;<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>
So you have to go to a meeting when you want to,<br>
<li>
and you have to go to a meeting when you don't want to.<br>
</ul>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind" target="_blank">Damned if you do, damned if you don't.</a>
<p>
And if you really don't need to go to a meeting, because you have years of sobriety
and you don't need to hear the usual slogans repeated again for the hundredth time, you still
have to go to a meeting &quot;to be there for the newcomer&quot;.

<p>
A.A. allows little deviation from the rules.
The hard-core true believers will tell you that any failure to
conform to the dictates of the standard A.A. dogma will result
in a relapse and dying drunk, and it will also prove that you
are diseased and <i>in denial</i>, and they will say that
&quot;you are not working a strong enough program&quot;, that
you are
&quot;<a href="#death_warrant" target="_blank">signing your own death warrant</a>&quot;.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our suggested

Bill Wilson constantly demanded that you have complete and total faith in his

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

(Titled <i>Traveler, Editor, Scholar</i> in the first edition.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson used all of chapter four of the <i>Big Book</i> to lecture the
readers on how they must believe in Bill Wilson's version of God.
Wilson even declared that you must abandon human intelligence, logic,
and 'Reason', and just have blind faith in his program. You can't even
allow intelligence, common sense, or sanity to interfere with
belief that Bill Wilson's way is <i>The Only Way</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe

We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,
even against organized religion. ...
People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
<i>We Agnostics</i>, page 49.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<i>We Agnostics</i>, pages 54-55.</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
(So, because Bill and his friends couldn't think correctly, you shouldn't try to, either.)

<blockquote>

had brought us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.

Francis Hartigan was Lois Wilson's private secretary, so
if anybody should be privy to the insider secrets
about Bill's infidelities, it would be Francis.
And Hartigan says that Bill was about as faithful as a horny alley cat,
all of his life, both before and after sobriety. Hartigan says that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Founders_Watch" target="_blank">
Bill regularly 13th-stepped the dewy-eyed pretty young things</a>
who showed up at the A.A. meetings. Bill was so obnoxious that the
other old-timers had to form a committee to watch him &#8212;
&quot;The Founder's Watch Committee&quot; &#8212; to follow
Bill around and keep him from doing it all again and again, and publicly
embarrassing Alcoholics Anonymous yet again.
