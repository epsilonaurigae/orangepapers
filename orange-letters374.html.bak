Hi Orange,

<p>
I had a couple questions concerning your preferred program of recovery. Is
that the only one that works because it works for you? Based on what I have
read on your page, you will most likely be quick to deem me a `Stepper`
(much, might I add, like McCarthy did with supposed communists), but I feel
the question begs to be asked: what brings about your strong feelings of
disdain for AA and step programs? Programs, that when worked properly,
bring people into lives they may never have found had they not found a God?
I understand your program to be one of willpower, but does it also teach to
denounce other methods as wrong? Is anonymity an important issue, as I
notice the handle `Orange` used in reply to letters as opposed to a name? I
would love to keep the lines of communication open between us so that I may
better understand. Thanks. Also, the definition of a cult on
dictionary.comdoes not sound like the cults we think of today.
However, I suppose that if
you're against religion in any sense, organized or not, it would seem like
a bad thing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello William,
<p>
The answer to your question is very simple: I am strongly opposed to the 12-Step treatment
of alcohol abuse and addictions because it does not work, and they lie about that fact.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
The failure rate of 12-Step treatment is well-known, and well-documented</a>, and yet,
they still begin every meeting by lying to the newcomers:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
RARELY have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
By the way, that line uses 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">the propaganda technique
of lying with qualifiers</a>:
<font color="black">&quot;has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;</font><br>
If he doesn't get sober, then he didn't &quot;thoroughly&quot; follow our path.<br>
If he did get sober, then he did thoroughly follow our path.<br>
Nonsense.

<p>
Likewise, you used the same qualifier in your letter: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
Programs, that when worked properly,
bring people into lives they may never have found had they not found a God?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
When worked properly? Please define &quot;worked properly&quot;.

<p>
You are also assuming that people find God through A.A., which is also a groundless assumption.
There is as much reason to believe that they find Santa Claus or
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Satan" target="_blank">
 Satan as their helper</a>. Pray, &quot;Oh Higher Power, please gimme, gimme, gimme!&quot;

<p>
About: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I understand your program to be one of willpower, but does it also teach to
denounce other methods as wrong?<br>
</font>
</blockquote> 

<p>
There really isn't any &quot;my program&quot;. I do not push any particular program, although
I do recommend programs that teach self-control and rational thinking, like SMART,
SOS, WFS, and Lifering. My personal way of staying sober is to just not ever put another
drink in my mouth. (Or another cigarette. Or another hit of dope.)
<p>
<h3>Just don't take that first drink, not ever, no matter what.</h3>
<p>
That is the answer to all questions about drinking, or &quot;just having one&quot;.
<p>
And yes, sometimes that does involve willpower, but more often it requires
clear, realistic thinking, like, <i><b>&quot;Once you open that door, all Hell will break loose.&quot;</b></i>
<p>
I wrote more about &quot;my methods&quot;, or my personal way, here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

<p>
I denounce those methods that are proven failures.
Especially when they lie to sick people about how well their suggested cure works.
That is really heartless treatment of sick people.

<p>
Anonymity used to be an issue, but it isn't any more. My birth name is Terrance Hodgins,
and I live in rural Oregon, west of Portland.
I continue to use the &quot;Orange&quot; pen name because I have used it
for so many years that many people don't know me by any other name.

<p>
If you want to understand the definition of a cult, we can do far better than the short dictionary
definition. Please read the Cult Test, both the questions and the answers:<br>
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult.html</a>

<p>
But even the dictionary definitions of &quot;cult&quot; are applicable: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
<b>Cult</b>
<font size="-1">(Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Second Edition, 1993.)</font><br>
<i>n.</i><br>
<ul>
<li> 1. a particular system of religious worship, esp. with reference
to its rites and ceremonies.
<li> 2. an instance of great veneration of a person, ideal, or
thing, esp. as manifested by a body of admirers: <i>the physical
fitness cult.</i>
<li> 3. the object of such devotion.
<li> 4. a group or sect bound together by veneration of the same
thing, person, ideal, etc.
<li> 5. <i>Sociol.</i> a group having a sacred ideology and a set
of rites centering around their sacred symbols.
<li> 6. a religion or sect considered considered to be false,
unorthodox, or extremist, with members often living outside of
conventional society under the direction of a charismatic leader.
<li> 7. the members of such a religion or sect.
<li> 8. any system for treating human sickness that originated
by a person usually claiming to have sole insight into the
nature of disease, and that employs methods regarded as
unorthodox or unscientific.
</ul> 
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
A.A. especially qualifies with definition 8, where A.A. claims to be the only way to treat alcoholism,
and Bill Wilson just somehow magically came up with all the answers that had eluded everybody
from Jesus Christ to contemporary doctors.

</ul> 
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, A.A. matches several of those descriptions, and especially matches definition 5.

<p>
Yes, I'll be happy to have lines of communication open. We can talk again.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Re: [www.orange-papers.info] Re: lawsuit threat<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I am not aware of that case.  On any account, I am not aware of any
criminal statues that this attorney may have violated.  So far, all he has
done is threaten to invoke lawful process, and he has not asked for any
settlement money.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Pennywise,
<p>
I haven't been able to find that case either. It was just a passing thought about
a lawyer being a co-conspirator in conspiring to deprive someone of his Constitutional rights.
That would be a long-shot, and would probably have to go to the Supreme Court.
But no matter. The anti-SLAPP thing is much better.
</font>
<p>
That said, it appears he is threatening to file what is known as a
Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP).  A SLAPP suit is
basically a meritless lawsuit designed to deter people from exercising
their First Amendment right to free speech.  Fortunately, many states (such
as Oregon and California) have enacted laws to quickly dispose of these
types of actions.  Specifically, in those jurisdictions, once the lawsuit
is filed, a defendant can file a special motion to strike pursuant to that
state's anti-SLAPP statute.  In CA, for example, the defendant would first
have the burden of showing that the lawsuit was brought as a result
of his engaging in constitutionally protected speech.  Then, the burden
would shift to the plaintiff to show that he has a reasonable probability
of prevailing in the case.  If the plaintiff fails to show a reasonable
probability of success, the motion to strike will be granted, and the
defendant can recoup costs and attorney's fees.

<p>
Here, I think it would be hard for the plaintiff to demonstrate a
probability of success because 1) you did not publish any defamatory
statements, and 2) even if the statements were defamatory, you have
immunity under Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act (47 USC &sect; 230)<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222831/http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/communications-decency-act/" target="_blank">
http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/communications-decency-act/</a>,
<br>
which states, &quot;[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service
shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by
another information content provider.&quot;  In other words, the article J.R.
posted was true, and even if it weren't, you could not be held liable
because you didn't write it yourself &#8212; you simply provided the internet
forum.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, very good point. I hadn't even gotten around to harping on the fact that I did not
actually write or post the article. But I also believe in protecting my posters, so I'll fight it.
</font>
<p>
At this point, I imagine the court would grant your motion to strike.
Then, at least in CA, you would file a SLAPPback motion, which would
require the court to award you costs and reasonable attorney's fees.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes. It would be too bad if I won, and didn't have a lot of lawyer's fees to collect on.
But don't you charge a million dollars an hour for consultations? :-)
</font>
<p>
Anyway, as I said, I am not a licensed attorney in California or Oregon,
and this is meant only as a friendly overview.  Please contact a lawyer in
your jurisdiction if you are served process.  Also, you might find this
page very insightful:<br>

<p>

Hi there,

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I have been reading many of your recent letters.  I find them informative and
beneficial.  A recent one mentioned &quot;12 Steps to Destruction: Codependency Recovery
Heresies&quot; and you said you might try to find it at a library.  It is available as a
free e-book at the Bobgan's website:

<p>
<font color="blue">

<p>

</font>
<p>

Just click on the link there for their free e-books and it will take you to the page
where you can download it.  I hope you have your own laptop and can get it without
depending upon a library computer.
<p>
  I read most of this e-book way back in the fall
of 2006, right after I had to move out of my home and watch a thirty year marriage
blow up in my face.  I had been diagnosed as a sex addict though I never once
cheated on my wife.  So, wife and I were seeing a psychotherapist supposedly all up
on how to &quot;treat&quot; a sex addict husband and his &quot;codependent&quot; wife.  It's basically a
canned program.  These psychotherapists who sign onto &quot;SASH&quot;, Society for the
Advancement of Sexual Health&quot; basically just follow the plan developed by Patrick
Carnes (a true 12 stepper) and it's one size fits all.
<p>
  Lord help you if you are not
receptive to attending a 12 step group like SA or SAA.  Not being a total idiot, I
started investigating everything with a rather critical eye and this was one source
of information which flew in the face of the nonsense being pushed on me by this
SASH psychotherapist.  Just based upon reading this e-book, I was astonished that
this supposed &quot;Christian Psychotherapist&quot; could push a 12 step program on anyone.
It gave me a completely cynical view toward about 90% of the entire mental health
community, for sure any member dealing with supposed addictions.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Patrick Carnes is one of the master snake oil salesmen.  The entire concept of sex
addiction is flawed.  If you follow the money, it's really all about how to get
wealthy off gullible people who will believe the nonsense and must turn to Carnes
and his minions to obtain &quot;treatment&quot; and put their addiction on hold, this having
to be done through a 12 step process.  Codependency is a flawed construct as well.
What it provides is an excuse for the therapist to &quot;treat&quot; two people instead of
just one and the dollars flow in.  They misappropriate counseling away from clergy
and take it upon themselves.  But, they can't call viewing porn as sin, it has to be
an addiction and the person has a chronic disease.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Regarding codependency, that same fall of 2006 there was a Dr. Westermeyer who used
to have his own website, but which has since folded.  Part of an article he wrote is
still available at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222831/http://www.addictioninfo.org/" target="_blank">http://www.addictioninfo.org</a>
but it is
incomplete.  Now, this is a psychologist with a PhD. finally showing some sanity
instead of adopting the position of the majority treating addictions.  I saved the
entire article and have attached it for your perusal.
From a Christian point of view as well, the Bible never condemns self-sacrifice.
But the people who push the condependency nonsense sure do.  It's an opportunity to
throw the switch and devote oneself to the focus of self and with the approval of
all the misguided therapists.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

After doing loads and loads of my own research, I wasn't buying any of the 12 step
nonsense.  I found your website way back then too!  So, my balking at submitting to
the 12 step nonsense made me appear to be totally rebellious and wife opted to file
for divorce by March of 2007.  We had a total of three joint sessions with the idiot
therapist.  I had been required to move out at the end of October of 2006 and we
were to have no contact with each other.  I thought at the time this was the most
asinine therapeutic regimen I had ever heard of and still do seven years later.
Funny how so many therapists assume there is a &quot;one size fits all&quot; therapeutic
program.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Well, I am doing ok.  My kids and my grandkids love me.  I continue working and
making my own way, sharing a house with another single guy.  I just wish there was a
way that these misguided psychotherapists would get stopped from pushing the same
old garbage onto people and calling it &quot;treatment&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I hope the link and the article provide even more insight for you into the contrived
diagnosis of &quot;codependency&quot;.  I found many, many articles and a book which question
the entire notion of sex addiction.  Here is just one example:

addiction but they are in my home computer.  There is certainly NO NEED for a 12
step program for a nonexistent addiction.

Your work is brilliant.  I just wish you received more credit than you receive.
Obviously, your research and writings don't sit well with a great majority of
addictions counselors.  It can take a long time for a paradigm to change,
unfortunately.

disputes the idea of alcoholism or addiction being a disease:

PS.  I can't help it.  I thought of one more article you might enjoy.  This is a
critique of Celebrate Recovery, the &quot;Christianized&quot; but misguided adoption of doing
twelve steps.  Funny that God would wait 1900 years before providing a method for
turning away from destructive drinking and in this tardy fashion provide to the
necromancer, Bill Wilson, the &quot;right&quot; method and be 2000 years tardy for the
&quot;Christianized&quot; version to arrive.  Dream on.

Hello Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. That says so much. I'm sorry to hear about your suffering.
I trust that you are doing okay. And thanks for the compliments.

<p>
I quite agree about what a racket &quot;codependency&quot; is.   It's pure fraud.
There is no scientific or medical basis to it. Neither the American Medical Association,
nor the FDA, nor the American Psychiatric Association even recognize the existence
of such a disease.
Andrew Meacham, in his great book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Meacham" target="_blank"><i>Selling Serenity: Life Among the Recovery Stars</i></a>,
described &quot;Codependency&quot; as &quot;invent a non-existent disease, and then
charge a fortune to treat it.&quot;

<p>
Then, the idea that they are going to &quot;treat&quot; this
&quot;disease&quot; with an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties
is really over the top. And for it to be an old pro-Nazi cult religion
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Satan" target="_blank">that resembles Satan-worship
more than it resembles Christianity</a>
is almost unbelievable. And yet it's true. You wouldn't think that an
anti-Christian religion could possibly become popular in America, would
you? Alas, a lot of people don't pay close attention to the details.
They just hear someone mumble the word &quot;God&quot; a few times, and
they think that A.A. must be a great organization, and very spiritual too.
<p>
And the bottom line, the fact that several of your references stress, is the fact
that 12-Step treatment does not work. That has been proven many times.

<p>
So why isn't there a law against it? Because the FDA regulates medications, but not treatments for
addictions. Or pseudo-addictions like codependency.

<p>
Yes, there is lots of room for gray areas in the debate about sexual addiction. It's an undeniable
fact that Nature has given us strong sex drives to keep the species going. Someone who
wants sex on a regular basis is normal and healthy, not diseased or addicted.
<p>
Show me a species without any sex drive and I'll show you an extinct species.

<p>
You are also quite right about the conflict between Christian teachings
 and the &quot;codependency treatment&quot; teachings.
Christianity teaches that people should be more caring and loving and giving.
The &quot;codependency counselors&quot; teach that caring about and loving an addict
or an alcoholic is a disease from which you must be cured.
What amazes me is how few people notice such glaring contradictions.

<p>
The document that you sent,
<a href="When_Caring_Becomes_a_Disease.pdf" target="_blank">When_Caring_Becomes_a_Disease.pdf</a>,
says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The idea was that the
caring behavior manifested by family members and spouses actually "enabled" the addict
to continue using. At first glance, the emphasis on the family was certainly a welcome
step. Regardless of theoretical orientation working with a substance abuser in isolation,
who is in an intimate relationship, is missing a rich opportunity to recruit more players
into the change agenda. Unfortunately, from the mid eighties to the present, the
codependency idea has become bastardized, and with each new self-help book the
symptoms of codependency mount.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes indeed. See the file
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="_blank">Twelve-Step Snake Oil</a>
for much more about that.  Everything and anything is a &quot;symptom of
codependency&quot;, even caring too much and caring too little.
<p>
And the idea that you are &quot;enabling&quot; someone by being nice to
him is downright evil. It reminds me of the Nazi philosophy more than
anything else.
&quot;Treat the <i>Untermenschen</i> very harshly. It will improve their
character. Besides, they deserve it.&quot; 
<p>
The idea that the cure for caring about an addict is to do the practices
of Dr. Frank Buchman's religion for the rest of your life is insane.

About the Berean research article that criticizes Celebrate
Recovery (CA) as heretical:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222831/http://www.thebereancall.org/content/way-which-seemeth-right" target="_blank">
http://www.thebereancall.org/content/way-which-seemeth-right</a>

<p>
Yes, I have to agree with most all of it. There are just a few glaring errors that I have to
comment on:

<ol>
<p><li> 
This paragraph contains several errors or misimpressions:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
 To begin with, 12-Steps programs are not just a Saddleback Church issue.
Increasing numbers of evangelical churches are sponsoring Alcoholics
Anonymous (A.A.) and Narcotics Anonymous (N.A.) meetings and/or creating
their own self-help groups based upon A.A.'s 12-Steps principles. Bill
Wilson, one of the founders of A.A., created the 12 Steps. Wilson was
a habitual drunk who had two life-changing events that he claims helped
him achieve sobriety: 1) he was (mis)informed by a doctor that his drinking
habit was a disease and was therefore not his fault, and 2) he had an
experience (which he viewed as spiritual enlightenment) that convinced
him that only &quot;a Power greater than&quot; himself could keep him sober.
Attempting to understand his mystical experience, he was led into spiritism,
a form of divination condemned in the Scriptures. His official biography
indicates that the content of the 12-Steps principles came to him
&quot;rapidly&quot; through spirit communication. Certainly not from God.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Last item first, Bill Wilson did not have a &quot;mystical experience&quot;,
he had a drug experience.  In 1933 and 1934, Bill Wilson was detoxed in
Charlie Towns' Hospital  &#8212; four times in a little over a year  &#8212; 
where he was given the quack
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">&quot;Belladonna Cure&quot;</a>,
which featured large doses of belladonna, which is a poisonous atropine
alkaloid in the same family as Deadly Nightshade. How it works is: it
basically poisons you until you have one foot in the grave, and you
hallucinate your brains out. Belladonna is even more powerful than LSD
for making people hallucinate. Belladonna had the handy side effect of
completely immobilizing the patients. They were too busy talking to their
ancestors or flying through the sky with weird animals to even think
about leaving the hospital.  After two or three days of being dosed
with belladonna, Bill Wilson saw a white light which he interpreted as
&quot;the God of the preachers&quot;.  (More details and descriptions of that are
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
There are some big problems with even that story (as there are with most
of Bill Wilson's history of himself and A.A.).
Bill Wilson bragged that he had a great spiritual experience where he felt like he was
on a mountaintop, with a wind of spirit blowing through him.  
Wilson's biographer Robert Thomsen repeated Bill's story this way:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
His fingers relaxed a little on the footboard [of the bed],
his arms slowly reached out and up. &quot;I want,&quot; he
said aloud. &quot;I want...&quot;

<a name="wanttolive"><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ever since infancy</a>, they said, he'd been reaching out
this way, arms up, fingers spread, and as far back as he could
remember he'd been saying just that. But always before it
had been an unfinished sentence. Now it had its ending.
<i>He wanted to live.</i> He would do anything, anything,
to be allowed to go on living.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, God,&quot; he cried, and it was the sound not of a man,
but of a trapped and crippled animal. &quot;If there is a
God, show me. Show me. Give me some sign.&quot;<br>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As he formed the words, in that very instant he was
aware first of a light, a great white light that filled the
room, then he suddenly seemed caught up in a kind of joy, an
ecstasy such as he would never find words to describe. It
was as though he were standing high on a mountaintop and a
strong clear wind blew against him, around him, through him
&#8212; but it seemed a wind not of air, but of spirit &#8212; and as
this happened he had the feeling that he was stepping into
another world, a new world of consciousness, and everywhere
now there was a wondrous feeling of Presence which all his
life he had been seeking. Nowhere had he ever felt so
complete, so satisfied, so embraced.<br> 
</font>
<font size="-1">&#8212; Robert Thomsen, <i>Bill W.</i>, 1975, pp. 222-223.<br>
(There is a longer quote and discussion of it
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">here</a>.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

First off, Bill Wilson summoned up God the way that a sourcerer summons
up a demon, and Bill Wilson did not even bother to say &quot;please&quot;.
Bill commanded God to appear, and God had no choice but to obey Bill Wilson
and make an appearance. And &quot;show me a sign&quot; is Pharisiacal,
which Jesus condemned in the Bible.
<p>
And drug hallucinations are not necessarily mystical experiences, or
spiritual experiences. Now some may be, I don't want to be too
narrow-minded, I think spiritual experiences are wonderful no matter
how you get them, but what really defines such a spiritual experience
is what effect it has on your life in the following years. Someone who
went from a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; to lying, thieving, sexual
predation and philandering, and practicing necromancy and &quot;spooking&quot;
does not inspire confidence in the validity of his &quot;mystical experience&quot;.
<p>
Then, the entire story seems to be stolen from Bill Wilson's own grandfather.
<a name="Hartigan2"> </a>
In the biography of Bill that was written by Lois Wilson's personal
secretary, Francis Hartigan, we learn that Bill's paternal grandfather,
who was also named William Wilson, also had a bad drinking problem.
In desperation, he climbed a mountain one Sunday morning and had a
religious experience of a wind of Spirit blowing through him, and he
never drank again:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
William Wilson may have preferred inn keeping to quarrying, but
inn keeping is seldom the right occupation for a hard-drinking man.
His attempts to control his drinking led him to try Temperance
pledges and the services of revival-tent preachers. Then, in a
desperate state one Sunday morning, he climbed to the top of
Mount Aeolus. There, after beseeching God to help him, he saw
a blinding light and felt the wind of the Spirit. It was a conversion
experience that left him feeling so transformed that he practically
ran down the mountain and into town.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he reached the East Dorset Congregation Church, which is across
the street from the Wilson House, the Sunday service was in progress.
Bill's grandfather stormed into the church and demanded that the
minister get down from the pulpit. Then, taking his place, he
proceeded to relate his experience to the shocked congregation.
Wilson's grandfather never drank again. He was to live another
eight years, sober.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.; A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous
Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan, page 11.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

What are the odds that both Bill's grandfather and Bill would
have exactly the same dramatic religious experience,
almost word-for-word identical,
<ul>
<li> both beseeching God for help,
<li> both seeing a blinding White Light,
<li> both feeling that they were on a mountaintop
with a wind of Spirit blowing through them,
<li> and both being so overwhelmed by the experience that they never
drank again?
</ul>
<p>
Or did Bill Wilson just appropriate his grandfather's story to
embellish his own detox experience?
<br>
Did Bill Wilson just exaggerate his drug experience to get more
&quot;spiritual credentials&quot; to be the leader of a cult religion?
<br>
Did Bill's grand vision of God really happen at all?




<p><br><li>
Back to that first quote from Berean Research above, it contains this sentence:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
His official biography indicates that the content of the 12-Steps principles came
to him &quot;rapidly&quot; through spirit communication. Certainly not from God.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is almost right, but wrong. It is true that
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult2" target="_blank">Bill Wilson conducted
s&eacute;ances and played with a Ouija Board and spirit rapping and
channelling spirits</a>,
and Bill Wilson claimed that he got help with his second book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#12X12" target="_blank"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i></a>
from the spirit of Boniface the Christian missionary.  But Bill Wilson
got the 12 Steps straight from Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot;
cult religion, and he said so.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">The 12 Steps
are merely a rewrite of Frank Buchman's cult recruiting and indoctrination
practices</a>:

<p><br>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>The Language of the Heart</i>, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Bill Wilson was of course being deceptive there. Bill Wilson gave the
credit to Rev. Sam Shoemaker, who was the number two man in the Oxford Group,
and Frank Buchman's right-hand man.
Wilson was reluctant to mention the name of Frank Buchman then because
Buchman was so hated by the American and British people for
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">his support of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis</a>.

<p>
So the material for the 12 Steps did not come from the Bible, or from talking to spirits.
It came from the practices of the pro-Nazi Oxford Group cult religion.
<p>
<a name="brainwash"> </a>
The 12 Steps are not spiritual practices or &quot;spiritual principles&quot;,
they are brainwashing practices.
Dr. Robert Jay Lifton was one of the pioneering doctors who studied the American soldiers
who came back from the Korean War brainwashed, and Dr. Lifton summarized the essential
elements of an effective brainwashing program as eight characteristics
(<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">summarized here</a>).
The 12 Steps of A.A. contain all eight of them.
So do the practices of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group and &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;,
which is what Buchman later renamed the Oxford Group to.
<p>
Here is the interesting kicker: 
During the Korean War, a member of Moral Re-Armament was in the U.S. Army in Korea, and he
got captured and was a prisoner of war who was subjected to the Red Chinese brainwashing program.
The MRA member marvelled that Chinese brainwashing was just like an MRA meeting.
<p>
Was that just a coincidence? No. Dr. Frank Buchman was a missionary to China in the late nineteen-tens
and early nineteen-twenties, and he taught the Chinese his strange
mind-damaging methods of religious conversion. The Chinese Communists merely recycled Frank
Buchman's conversion techniques. 

<p><br><li>
Further down, the Berean page says, 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
In these foundational steps, Wilson is summarizing his beliefs based upon
his experiences as a &quot;recovering alcoholic.&quot; He felt &quot;powerless&quot; because
he believed alcoholism was an incurable disease that consequently made
his life &quot;unmanageable.&quot; Since he couldn't &quot;cure&quot; himself (although
millions do without 12-Step or other therapies!), he put his faith in
&quot;a power greater than ourselves,&quot; whom he called God, and &quot;understood&quot;
Him by fabricating Him out of beliefs discovered in his study of different religions
and religious experiences. That's more than &quot;biblically vague.&quot;
It's a false religion.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is sort of right, but also very wrong. Bill Wilson's Steps were not based on
his alcohol abuse or recovery, or study of foreign religions.
Again, this is a misunderstanding based on the Berean author's lack of knowledge about
the Oxford Group roots of Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12 Steps:
<p>
<ul>  
<li> Frank Buchman taught that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#powerless" target="_blank">you are powerless over sin
and have been defeated by it</a>,
and
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender" target="_blank">only surrender to God will save you</a>.

<li> Bill Wilson merely changed the word &quot;sin&quot; to &quot;alcohol&quot;
and preached that you are powerless over alcohol and have been defeated
by it, and only surrender to God will save you.
</ul>
<p>
That was not a Biblical teaching at all. Jesus never said that the ideal
religious life was being a mindless &quot;surrendered&quot; slave of God
(Step 3) who got his work orders through s&eacute;ances (Step 11).
<p>
In both Buchmanism and A.A., the ideal believer could be a radio-controlled toy robot
bought at Radio Shack. It just always immediately follows orders and mindlessly
obeys commands from above.  Dr. Frank Buchman even claimed that his follows were
controlled by
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#radiograms" target="_blank">&quot;powerful spiritual radiograms&quot;</a>.
So the Buchmanites marched around like so many little robots who were
&quot;guided by God&quot;.
And they were always listening for what &quot;God&quot; told them to do next.
And then they did whatever the voices in their heads told them to do.
<p>
And yes, sometimes they also listened to &quot;other spirits&quot; for entertainment.
(<a href="orange-rroot090.html#ftnt146_ret" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)

<p>
Bill Wilson learned all of that while he was a member of the Oxford Group. And so did
the other co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith and Clarence Snyder.
All three of them were true believers in Frank Buchman's cult religion, and they continued
to believe in it and teach it even after they left the group.
And Alcoholics Anonymous is still teaching the same perverse religion today.

</ol>
<p>
The rest of the Berean Research page is pretty correct. Rick Warren is making a huge
mistake when he tries to adapt the 12-Step program and make it into a Christian program.
He might as well adopt a Satan-worshipping church and try to make it compatible with Christianity.

<p>
Have a good day now.

INTERESTING HISTORICAL NOTE: (2013.11.13):
<p>

I was at the semi-annual used book sale at the Forest Grove Library yesterday, when I saw a
book about Nazi history:
&quot;<i>the SS, alibi of a nation, 1922-1945</i>&quot;, by Gerald Reitlinger (1957, Viking Press).  
I looked at the index to see if there was any mention of Frank Buchman or the Oxford Group,
like I always do with any history book from that period. I can't begin to estimate how
many books I have searched for any mention of Buchmanism. There is almost never one.
Frank Buchman's cult was apparently just too small and unimportant to
make it into many histories. The indices alway
list things like, &quot;Buch, Walter; Bucharest; Buchenwald; Budapest...&quot; but no Buchman.
But this time I got lucky: &quot;Buchmanites; 21n&quot;.

<p>
I had to look carefully to find the reference in the last footnote on page 21, where it
was describing the character of Heinrich Himmler:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
He had just married Marge Conzersowo, a nurse in a fashionable Berlin clinic who had seen
through the science of medicine as practiced by the orthodox faculty.<font size="-1"><sup>9</sup></font>
She interested Himmler in mesmerism, hom&oelig;opathy, and herbal remedies. Himmler
with his agricultural diploma particulary liked herbs.

<p>
Holy shit!
<p>
<b>Heinrich Himmler joined Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion?</b>
<p>
<b>Heinrich Himmler was a Buchmanite?</b>
<p>
Was &quot;the author of the holocaust&quot; actually a follower of Dr. Frank Buchman, who was also
indirectly the founder (or grandfather) of Alcoholics Anonymous?
Was the guy who exterminated 6 million Jews in the concentration camps, and
also another 4 million gays, Gypsies, Poles, political dissidents, Leftists, Communists,
intellectuals, and Catholic priests and Protestant ministers who opposed Naziism,
actually a member of the Oxford Group?

<p>
How could almost all of the historians have missed such an important detail?
Historically, this is significant.
<p>
And &quot;from 1935 onwards&quot; would mean that Bill Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith,
Clarence Snyder, and Heinrich Himmler were all members of the Oxford Group at the same time.
Then
<a href="orange-rroot300.html" target="_blank">British Prime Minister Nevil Chamberlain
joined too</a>.
What a big happy family it was.

<p>
Previously,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Robert_Byron1" target="_blank">we knew that Heinrich Himmler
was friends with some Oxford Group members</a>: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Byron entered in his diary:
'Himmler apparently dotes on the Oxford Group and writes to its English members discussing
their troubles with them.'<font size="-1"><sup>66</sup></font><br>

<p>
But neither Byron nor Padfield said that Heinrich Himmler actually joined the Oxford Group cult religion,
or was a convert.

<p>
I shall have to study this further. Maybe interlibrary loans (ILL) can get me the source book,
which is in French. Alas, I don't speak much French. Maybe Bablefish or Google translator can help there.
<p>
By the way, I bought the SS book. $2. Special thanks to the guy who donated $25 the day before yesterday.
The money is already being put to good use. (Who would have thought?)

<p>
Upwards and onwards. Have a good day now.
<p>
LATER: 2013.11.16:
<p>
I finally found the referenced book in Worldcat (the library's world catalog).
Apparently, Gerald Reitlinger got the name of the book slightly wrong. It isn't 
<i>Croix gamm&eacute;e ou caduc&eacute;e</i>, it is
<i>Croix gamm&eacute;e contre caduc&eacute;e</i>, by Francois Bayle.
The first name translates to &quot;the Swastika or the Caduceus&quot;,
and the second one is &quot;the Swastika against the Caduceus&quot;,
or &quot;the Swastika versus the Caduceus&quot;.
<p>
The full name of the book is: <i>Croix gamm&eacute;e contre caduc&eacute;e
&#8212; Les Experiences Humaines En Allemagne Pendant La Deuxieme Guerre
Mondiale</i>, by Francois Bayle. That is,
&quot;The Swastika versus the Caduceus &#8212; The Human Experiments In
Germany During The Second World War&quot;.
Published by Centre De L'Imprimerie Nationale a Neustadt (Palatinat), 1950.
8 volumes, 1521 pages.

A caduceus is that symbol that we identify with doctors and medical
treatment, the two snakes entwining around a winged staff. Like this: 
<p>

Apparently, this book is an eight-volume chronicle of the Nuremberg War Crimes trials of
Nazi doctors who tortured Jews and other prisoners with medical tests and experiments.
So apparently, Karl Gebhardt testified in a trial that it was widely reported
around 1935 that Heinrich Himmler had joined Dr. Frank Buchman's religious movement.
And Heinrich Himmler's wife was a Buchmanite who managed to recruit him into the Oxford Group.

<p>
I put in an ILL request on it.
I hope I don't have to go through all eight volumes to learn what I seek.
I have the feeling that I may learn more French than I really wanted to.
<p>
We know that Frank Buchman and Heinrich Himmler met
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg" target="_blank">at the 1934 Nuremberg Nazi Party Day rally</a>.
The German aristocratic lady Moni von Cramon was a leading Buchmanite who worked
for Heinrich Himmler as his secretary. (In the sanitized and white-washed
MRA history, they claim that Himmler blackmailed her into working for him,
and that she used her position to warn people who were about to be liquidated.)
Moni invited Frank Buchman to the Nuremberg rally. There, Frank Buchman and Heinrich Himmler had lunch
together where they discussed religion and politics. Then, in 1935, Buchman was again the
personal guest of Himmler, and again they had lunch together and discussed religion and politics.
Then in 1936, Frank Buchman was the personal guest of Heinrich Himmler at the Berlin Olympics.
<p>
But to hear that Heinrich Himmler
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender" target="_blank">&quot;surrendered to God&quot;</a>
and was &quot;changed&quot; by the Buchmanites is something new.
And to hear that Heinrich Himmler's wife was a believer in Buchmanism who converted Heinrich Himmler
is significant too.

<p>
So, after Heinrich Himmler was &quot;changed by God&quot;, he went and murdered
about 10 or 20 million innocent people? That isn't how religious conversion is usually
supposed to work.

Himmler's death toll was like:
<ul>
<li> 6 million Jews killed in the concentration camps and mass killings.
<li> 4 million others killed in the concentration camps &#8212;
gays, Gypsies, foreigners, political dissidents, Leftists, Communists,
intellectuals, and Catholic priests and Protestant ministers who opposed Naziism.
<li>

 6 million Poles killed when the S.S. did &quot;housecleaning&quot;
in Poland, killing everyone who could be a potential leader of resistance:
political leaders, priests and ministers, intellectuals, university professors, doctors,
labor union leaders... any and all leaders. Himmler wanted to reduce Poland
to being a nation of subservient slave servants of Germany.
Well, actually, Adolf Hitler wanted it, so he gave the orders to Heinrich Himmler,
and Himmler gave the orders to the S.S., who did the &quot;housecleaning&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In 1939 he [Adolf Hitler] began liquidating what he termed the 'leading classes'
in Poland &#8212; teachers, priests, intellectuals, entrepreneurs. About 70,000
Poles were killed in action, but by the end of the war about 6 million
Poles were dead. Only half were Jewish.<br>
</font>

<i>Hitler and Geli</i>, Ronald Hayman, page 216.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<li> I don't know the numbers of people killed in the Ukraine, but it's millions.
The S.S. rounded up and killed all of the Jews that they could get,
and also anyone else who resisted German occupation.
The total death toll in the Soviet Union, including deaths in combat, was 12 million.
<p>
(You know you are dealing with mass murder when you just round off the death toll to the nearest million.)
</ul>
<p>
Wow. With &quot;servants of God&quot; like that, who needs a Devil?

<p>
What I wonder about is, do you suppose Heinrich Himmler imagined that
he was hearing the Voice of God during his morning &quot;Quiet Times&quot;
as he &quot;listened for Guidance&quot;?
Do you suppose Heinrich Himmler believed that he was carrying out the Will of God?

<p>
Quite possibly so.  Hitler believed it: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator.
By warding off the Jews I am fighting for the Lord's work.<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  ==  Adolph Hitler, Speech, Reichstag, 1936 
</blockquote>
<p>
Did Himmler imagine that he was getting secret messages from Higher Powers?
Quite possibly.
Heinrich Himmler was crazy superstitious, and 
a real nut about &quot;spiritual&quot; matters.
Peter Padfield notes that from late 1923 to early 1924,
Heinrich Himmler's reading included books on spiritualism, second sight,
astrology, telepathy, and the like.
Heinrich Himmler fancied himself the reincarnation of
an ancient Bavarian king, King Heinrich, returned to life to
fulfill a grand destiny.
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
Note that Heinrich Himmler fancied himself the reincarnation of the Bavarian King Heinrich.
But Heinrich Himmler was not decended from that king; Himmler was descended from one of King Heinrich's
servants. In spite of Himmler's belief that &quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;folk&quot; characteristics are
transmitted genetically, through the blood line, in his mind Heinrich Himmler somehow managed to jump
family lines and believe himself the reincarnation of a king from whom he was not descended.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Fascinated by tales of King Arthur and his knights, Himmler's &quot;Camelot&quot;
for his own knightly Order was the castle of Wewelsberg near
Paderborn in Westphalia. Having acquired it in 1934, Himmler had massive
reconstruction work done (paid for by his company &quot;The
Society for the Protection and Maintenance of German Cultural Monuments&quot;)
&#8212; the labour came, of course, from the concentration camps.

<p>
The focal point of the castle was a huge round oak table with seating
for twelve of his senior Gruppenf&uuml;hrers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="SanSerif">
&quot;They sat in high-backed chairs made out of pigskin, on each of which
was a silver disk on which the selected 'knight' had his name
engraved. Here the chiefs of the SS were compelled to sit in the company
of their Grand Master [Himmler] for hours of contemplation and meditation ...
Each 'knight' had his own quarters in the castle...&quot;[Graber]
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Beneath this room was a crypt containing pedestals where should one of
the &quot;knights&quot; die an urn containing his ashes [Graber] or his coat
of arms [Padfield] would be burnt. Vents in the ceiling would allow those
in the main hall to see the smoke rise or &quot;the spirit ascend into a
type of Valhalla&quot;. [Graber]

<p> 
Himmler declared that the S.S. was a holy order, who, like Teutonic Knights
of Old, were on a Holy Mission to ennoble humanity by making the Aryan
race pure and supreme everywhere.
Both Hitler and Himmler even had portraits of themselves painted,
showing them as knights dressed in shining suits of armor.
They bandied about words like
&quot;honor&quot;, &quot;nobility&quot;, &quot;spirituality&quot;,
and &quot;purity&quot;, which may strike us as unbelievably hypocritical
today, but they believed them at the time.
