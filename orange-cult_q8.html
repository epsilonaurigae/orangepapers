Hypocrisy</b></font><br>
<p>
The cult doesn't practice what it preaches. The cult leader and high-ranking members break their own rules.
<p>
Cult members, including the leader, hypocritically project their own sins and crimes
onto people outside of the cult:
<ul>
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are dishonest.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are unspiritual.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> have a hidden agenda.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are narrow-minded and intolerant.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are a bunch of bigots.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> don't care about the future of the world.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are incompetent.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are trying to eliminate the competition.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are only in it for the money.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> have an evil leader.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are immoral.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are ambitious and greedy.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are not doing the Will of God.&quot;

<li> &quot;<i>They</i> are hypocritical.&quot;

<p>
A cult is an assemblage of people who don't want to know the truth.
They often claim that they do; they may talk about &quot;Seeking the Truth&quot;,
or &quot;Seeking to Understand the Word of the Lord&quot;,
or even &quot;having the Truth&quot;,
but they actually do not want to hear the truth. They just want their own
beliefs and superstitions confirmed.
<p>
Cults:
<ul>
<li> reject the truth,
<li> deny the truth,
<li> won't hear the truth,
<li> don't tell the truth,
<li> ignore the truth,
<li> dislike the truth,
<li> abhor the truth,
<li> avoid honest, intelligent discussions of the truth,

If a group is classified as a religion, then leaders of that group have considerable freedom, within the group at least, to set their own moral codes and to adjudicate between right and wrong. Potentially, any methods of persuasion, short of those which involve actual, legally provable physical coercion, may be considered reasonable within the ethical codes of a self-originated belief system. A sincere believer may feel that, in religious matters, the end justifies the means, and therefore various deceptive and devious practices may, in the mind of a believer, be justified as skillful means, crazy wisdom, or heavenly deception.<br>

When the actor Paul Haggis quit Scientology, citing the San Diego chapter's support of
the anti-homosexual California Proposition 8, a defender of Scientology commented:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I am always stunned in view of the obvious brainwashing that must have
happened to some internet posters (or rather the traveling circus of
&quot;commenters&quot; when it comes to stirring up anti-Scientology
resentment). Scientology has never been and is not against homosexuals
and supports their rights just as anyone else's. Given that, the big
question is: why did Haggis bother to make such show-down out of his
choice to sever his ties to the Church of Scientology (after several
years of inactivity, as he admits)? Guesses, anyone?

<p>
There, Louanne also resorts to
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks" target="_blank">attacking the critic
 and casting aspersions on his motives</a>,
which is yet another standard cult characteristic.

<p>
And notice Louanne's declaration that <i>critics</i> of Scientology are all &quot;brainwashed&quot;.
That is <i>projection</i>.
<p>
Cult leaders often practice what psychologists call
<a href="orange-cult-sos.html#projection" target="_blank"><i>projection</i></a>
&#8212; just accuse 'the enemy' of committing whatever crimes and sins the
cult leader is actually committing.
That's another aspect of <i>reversal of reality</i>.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Another Scientology reversal of reality is, their &quot;Road to Total Freedom&quot; is really a route to total slavery,
where you have given Scientology all of your money, your house, your credit cards, your life savings, your
bank account, and everything that you can borrow, and now you work for Scientology for free. (Ostensibly, in
trade for more &quot;auditing&quot;.)

<p> <a name="COG"> </a>
Cults are quick to deny the truth whenever they are the subject of valid criticism.
Deborah (Linda Berg) Davis, the daughter of cult leader David Berg and
authoress of <i>&quot;The Children of God: The
Inside Story&quot;</i>, gave us a good example of such denial and reversal of reality.
She talked about the time that Bob Rogers, a
news producer for the NBC television network, wanted to expose
the extremely loose sexual practices of <i>The Children of God</i>
(COG) cult,
which included &quot;Flirty Fishing&quot; prostitution
to get the cult more money and members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When asked if there was immorality going on within the COG,
Hosea [David Berg's son and Deborah's brother]
flatly denied it. Rogers countered Hosea's statements with interviews
he had filmed in America of female ex-members who gave eyewitness
accounts. The stark contrast between Hosea's denial and the witnesses'
testimony was incredible. But why would Hosea lie? To him it was not
lying. All cult members are taught instinctively to lie; the COG
is not unlike other cults in that matter. One is taught that it is
okay to &quot;cover&quot; the truth because &quot;other people wouldn't
understand our beliefs.&quot; Therefore, when Mr. Rogers asked
Hosea about immorality, Hosea flatly denied it. Hosea did not believe
it was &quot;immorality.&quot; Hosea's thoughts: &quot;To the public
it may appear as immorality, but to us it is the freedom of God's
spirit, which they know nothing of.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The final documentary for &quot;Chronolog&quot; showed Hosea to be an
outright, bold-faced liar. And he was.<br>

<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<a name="Synanon_rev"> </a>
Synanon gave us a good example of the reversal of reality:
the cult-owned businesses had the Synanon members
working 12 to 16 hours per day, seven days a week, for
wages that ranged from $2 to $25 per week, while the cult leader
Chuck Dederich, who lived in idle luxury at their expense,
complained that he had to support all of their lazy
asses.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>


<p>
The ideals publicly espoused by the cult are often the exact opposite of
the real practices of the cult in private.
For example,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Siddha_Yoga" target="_blank">Daniel Shaw wrote</a> of his
experiences in SYDA &#8212; &quot;Siddha Yoga&quot;, the cult of Swami Muktananda:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Social workers are taught early ...
the clients' right to self-determination, respect and dignity
for all, the innate worth of a human being, respect for uniqueness, and
the facilitation of the realization of potential.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Religious cults are skillful in advertising the promotion of these values
as the core of their philosophy. &nbsp; ...
The bait of these messages is used to attract members.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once membership is established, the messages are switched to ever-increasing
demands for obedience, submission and dependence. The actual value system
of a cult is often the antithesis of the system it advertises.<br>

Seeing Through Tinted Lenses</b></font><br>
<p>
Like someone who sees the world through rose-colored glasses, cult
members see everything through the filter of the cult's viewpoint.
Jesus freaks judge people on the basis of whether they are seekers,
trying to get closer to the Lord. Communists see everything in terms
of economics and class struggle. Recovery cults judge people on the
basis of their drug and alcohol consumption or abstention. Most all
cults judge people on how well they parrot the cult's favorite dogma and slogans.
<p>
After Patty Hearst, the daughter of the Hearst
Publishing heir, William Randolph Hearst III, was kidnapped,
tortured, and brain-washed by the terrorist Symbionese Liberation
Army, she saw her own father as just another rich Capitalist
creep who had never cared about the poor people.
She saw everything in terms of a revolutionary class struggle, and then she
acted on those beliefs, and went out and robbed banks to get the SLA more guns and money.
<p>
Similarly, the Moonies see everything in terms of Rev. Sun Myung Moon and the Unification
Church fighting against Satan, to reclaim the world for God.
<p>
<a name="Scientology_tinted_lenses"> </a>
Scientologists see everything in terms of mental malfunctions &#8212; they consider anyone
who isn't performing up to their standards to be brain-damaged and insane (and in need
of expensive Scientology therapy to restore their full potentiality).
And if you dare to criticize Scientology, they see that as proof that you are
mentally defective, and an &quot;unethical&quot; <i>Suppressive Person</i>, too.

Cult members love other cult members, just because they are fellow cult members, and hate critics

Amway very much devalues the outsiders.
Amway promoters love to brag that the Diamonds (rich, high-ranking Amway members)
 vacation in Switzerland and go on buying trips &#8212; not shopping
trips, <i>buying</i> trips &#8212; where they go to buy diamonds and jewelry,
 while the poor non-Amway people have to vacation in America and &quot;squat in the woods&quot;.

Freud has noticed another very important principle in the nature of the love energies
in the crowd. In a very significant saying he suggests that in any crowd hate tends to heap
up round the circumference.
The love energies are focussed inward within the group itself; the forces of hatred are
focussed outward toward those who do not belong to the group. We do not necessarily mean by
this hatred in the ordinary literal sense; we can however notice this trait in an
attitude of exclusiveness in the close-knit group towards those beyond its ranks.
Religious groups of many kinds adopt the attitude towards those outside their ranks:
&quot;Either you are all out with us, or you are the outcast, the sinner, the person
needing conversion, the person with whom we can have no co-operation, unless and until
you change and become one of us.&quot;
The closer the emotional bond within the group, the more this attitude of exclusiveness
and non-co-operation develop toward other rival groups.<br>

Those who leave a cult usually immediately become enemies and
scapegoats and ostracised pariahs, and contact with them is usually forbidden.
Defectors from the cult are viewed as very dangerous enemies because they may
encourage more members to leave (by saying true and sensible things about the cult).
Those who quit the cult become the ultimate outsiders.

knowledge. That's

As you might have guessed, the sun and moon are not planets, and they aren't exactly
&quot;scattered throughout the universe&quot;. And nobody but Prabhupada has found
living beings on the sun or moon. But those are minor details
compared to the rest of Prabhupada's goofy cosmology &#8212; Prabhupada
was the cult leader who taught his followers that the Earth is flat, and astronauts
never went to the moon, and Prabhupada is the Earth's guru for the next 10,000 years.

<p>
A corollary to <i>Devaluing the Outsider</i> is the demonization of critics and opponents
of the cult, and the rationalization of attacks on the cult's enemies.
Allegedly, &quot;they&quot; are such terrible people that it is okay to do bad things to them.<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;After all, they did it to us first, didn't they?&quot;<br>
</i></font>
<font color="blue">
Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler actually rationalized the mass murder
of the Jews on the grounds that
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Ford_Intl_Jew" target="_blank">&quot;the Jews&quot; had attacked Germany first</a>.
</font>
<p>
<a name="Scientology_devaluing_outsider" target="_blank"> </a>
Scientology says that it is okay to attack those who oppose Scientology.
Scientology declares that enemies of Scientology are &quot;fair game&quot;,
and that it is &quot;ethical&quot; to commit &quot;overts&quot; against them
and &quot;violate their dynamics&quot;.
In practice this has led to everything from malicious litigation intended to
bankrupt the target, to
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#Paulette_Cooper" target="_blank">framing Paulette Cooper for making bomb threats</a>,
to burglarizing U.S. Government offices and stealing thousands of government files
on people who criticized Scientology or who might do so in the future.

<p>
Another important corollary to <i>Devaluing the Outsider</i> is the devaluation of any information
that comes from people outside of the cult. Cult members often refuse to listen to or even consider any
independent sources of information that criticize the cult or its leader or its doctrines or practices.
The information is automatically considered invalid just because it comes from someone outside of the
cult.

<br><font size="+2"><b>
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_own_you">86</a>.
The group wants to own you.</b></font><br>
<p>
The cult wants your life.
Some cults want all of your money; some want all of your time;
most all of them want all of your heart, mind, and soul.<br>
<p>
One of the most obvious and visible problems here is &quot;too many meetings&quot;.
They want to occupy too much of your spare time &#8212; like all of it.
They have meetings,
and then they have classes or &quot;Bible study&quot; or &quot;training&quot;,
and perhaps also lots of prayer sessions or chanting or meditation sessions,
and then they have assemblies and conventions,
and then some more meetings, in an endless cycle.
And somewhere in the midst of all of that you are also supposed to go out recruiting
and/or fund-raising.
<p>
The cult also wants to control you. First, they want to control all of your time,
and then they will try to control more and more parts of your life: your sex life, your diet,
your choice of reading materials, your choice of jobs,
your consumption of drugs and alcohol (both legal and illegal), 
and sometimes even what doctor-prescribed medications you may take.

<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_channelling">87</a>.
Channelling or other occult, unchallengeable, sources of information.</b></font><br>
<p>
The cult teaches that members should meditate or pray or hold s&eacute;ances in order to
receive messages, information, and teachings from <i>The Beyond</i>, or from
a higher plane, or from an Ascended Master, or
<a href="orange-heresy.html#CIM" target="_blank">even from Jesus Christ</a> or
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">God</a>.
<p>
A corollary to this is that the cult claims that only it and its practices
can give you access that <i>Higher Reality</i>.
<p>
Another corollary is that the Guru and his inner circle are allegedly
far better at making contact with <i>&quot;The Beyond&quot;</i> than you are.
They can more clearly communicate with
<i>&quot;The Higher Planes&quot;</i>, or
<i>&quot;The Ascended Masters&quot;</i> (or whatever)
than you can,
because they have supposedly purified the Doors of Perception, and you
haven't.
So, whenever their received messages differ from yours,
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">they are always right</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong" target="_blank">you are always wrong</a>.


<p>
Channelled information creates a closed system that is entirely
self-referential. You can't argue with an Angel, or an Ascended Master,
or a Saintly Spirit who isn't there. All criticism can be deflected
by saying that you aren't pure enough, and you haven't done the
exercises or practices long enough
to have the visions, or hear the voices, and learn the
<i>&quot;Cosmic Truths&quot;</i> for yourself.<br>

They Make You Dependent On The Group.</b></font><br>
<p>
They make you dependent on the group, financially, emotionally, or socially
(or in all of those ways).<br>
<ul>
<li> They tell you that you cannot make any major life decisions without
their approval.
<li> Or, they take all of your money, and your checkbook and credit cards.
That makes you financially dependent on the cult for food, clothing,
medical care, everything, and makes leaving very difficult because you
have no personal resources at all remaining.
<li> Or, they tell you that you cannot live outside of the group.
<li> Or, they teach you that you are not capable of managing your own
life without their guidance.
<li> Or, they teach you that you cannot get to Heaven without their
religion, or their Master, or their teachings.
<li> And they tell you that you cannot think for yourself.
</ul>
<p>
Cults often encourage their members to regress psychologically &#8212; to return to childhood dependency
on parents and unthinking obedience and childlike gullibility.
Many cults call the leader &quot;Father&quot;, and the leader calls
his followers &quot;my children&quot;.

<p>
Cults also make people dependent on the group by taking away all external means of support.
Cults routinely confiscate members' bank accounts, credit cards, and any
other assets which
members may have, thus making leaving the cult very difficult.
Often, members are pressured into quitting outside jobs, and just working for the cult (for very
low wages, or for no wages at all).
The members become dependent on the cult for everything from food and clothing to
medical care.
Often, the cult then gives members an allowance that is so small that
members simply cannot afford to leave &#8212; they don't have enough money for a bus
ticket or a motel room.

<p>
<a name="Scientology_dependency"> </a>
Scientology teaches people that they are basically insane &#8212; having been
driven insane by memories of past injuries &#8212; and that only by getting
a lot of expensive Scientology-style psychotherapy can people be restored
to sanity.
<p>
The Moonies teach people that they have been defeated by Satan and his
Evil Ways, and that only the Unification Church can save them from the Devil.
<p>
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult taught people that they had all been
&quot;defeated by sin&quot;, and that their thinking was corrupted by
sin, and that only Buchman's religion could &quot;restore people to sanity&quot;.

<a name="cq_compliance"> </a>
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_compliance">89</a>.
Demands For Compliance With The Group</b></font><br>
<p>
This item is pretty obvious. It is in the nature of cults to demand
conformity and obedience, and to suppress dissent or independent thinking.
And they are pretty extreme about it.
<p>
The early Mormon church demanded &quot;Perfect Obedience&quot; &#8212;
meaning that the believers were expected to obey all orders from their
Bishops and higher leaders without question, no matter how extreme the
orders were.
That even went as far as practicing polygamy on orders from above,
and killing hundreds of innocent men, women, and children at
Mountain Meadows, on orders.

<p>
Many other cults make the same demands for total obedience.
<p>
Most cults demand the usual list of things:
<ol>
<li> You must revere the leader.
<li> You can't ever leave.
<li> You must obey all of the rules.
<li> You may not criticize the group or its leader or its beliefs,
doctrines, policies, or dogma.
<li> You must agree that the cult is right about everything.

</ol>
<p>
And of course cults have some means or other to enforce compliance:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Cults often start off with simple public criticism of nonconformists
and other rule breakers.

<p><li> Synanon evolved a system of &quot;contracts&quot; where people were sentenced
to any punishment that the group declared.


<a name="Scientology_compliance"> </a>
<p><li> And Scientology actually ran fortified and armed prison camps at
Gillman Hot Springs and Hemet, California, where unfortunate
Scientologists were imprisoned and tortured (given R.P.F. &#8212;
Rehabilitation Project Force).

<p><li> Some cults, like Jim Jones' <i>People's Temple</i> resorted to
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Jones_exhibiting" target="_blank">public beatings and whippings</a>,
even for the smallest of offenses.
And of course they are infamous for shooting those who tried to leave.

<p><li> And the Synanon goon squad, &quot;The Imperial Marines&quot;
degenerated into beating people too, as well as trying to kill splitters
and a lawyer, Paul Morantz, who was suing them for it.
</ul>

Newcomers Need Fixing.</b></font><br>
<p>
<p>
The cult claims that newcomers are flawed and in need of repair or rebuilding by the
cult.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Many cults claim that the newcomers aren't religious enough,
or don't pray enough, or aren't devoted to the Lord enough,
or haven't been reborn, or haven't been cleansed of sin... 

<p><li>
<a name="Prabhupada2"> </a>
Other cults claim that newcomers need to fix their minds and bodies by chanting,
meditation, yoga, or a new diet (or by all of them).
<p>
The founder-leader of the <i>Hari Krishna</i> cult (ISKCON) declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Chanting Hare Krsna is the easiest process by which to become purified,
especially in this age, when people are so dull that they cannot easily
understand spiritual knowledge. If one chants Hare Krsna, then his intelligence
become purified, and he can understand spiritual things.<br>

<font size="-1">
<i>The Science of Self-Realization</i>,

Exactly how does chanting <i>Hari Krishna</i> &quot;purify&quot; one's intelligence?

</blockquote>


<p><li>
<a name="Scientology_newcomers_fixing"> </a>
Scientology claims that its newcomers are mentally injured &#8212; basically, insane &#8212;
and in need of much expensive Scientology-style psychotherapy &#8212;
&quot;auditing&quot; &#8212; to fix their minds.

<p><li>
In Amway, you need fixing because you aren't a millionaire. You are allegedly infected with
all kinds of bad attitudes and beliefs that keep you from succeeding in life,
but if you become
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#on_faith" target="_blank">the abject faithful slave of your sponsor</a>,
he will teach you how to become a big success just like his upline Diamond is.

<p><li>
In recovery cults, this item is self-evident. The whole premise of recovery cults is
that you need fixing &#8212; that you need the group to control you and
make you quit doing something, like drinking or drugging too much, or eating too much,
or having
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">a &quot;wrong attitude&quot;
about your childhood or your spouse</a>, or something.
</ul>

<p>
Note that the claim that newcomers need fixing automatically places the old-timers
in a position superior to the newcomers &#8212; the old-timers have been fixed, but the
newcomers haven't. So the old-timers are inherently in a position where it is easy
to control and command the newcomers, ostensibly because the old-timers have been
healed, repaired, purified, or enlightened, and know &quot;The Great Truth&quot;,
while the newcomers do not.
