Subject:  	End-Time Cults<br>

<p>
Dear Sir:
<p>
I was in an &quot;end-times&quot; cult in the mid-1970's to early 1980's in
Tucson, Arizona.  It was called the Lighthouse Gospel Tract Foundation and
it was not the Jehovah Witnesses.  You could read the whole article in the
Arizona Daily Star, 1981 June edition.  I don't know what date, but probably
toward the end of the month, because the date was set for June 28 for the
Lord's coming and the end of the world, and the Big MidEast war and so on.
They predicted all of this using the bible.  They had other wierd teachings,
such as the one-world government conspiracy where all the Jewish people are
going to take over the world, and things like don't have any to do with your
family if they don't follow the Lord like they do and believe like they do
and so on.
<p>
It was a terrible tragedy for my life and for my wife who left me
because of it all.  I got her to join and she didn't believe it.
<p>
There is so much to say about it, but the consequences and effects from
such a group are real.
<p>
Thank you for your time.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Todd D.

Hello Todd,

Subject:  	Re: Done! Woo hoo!<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
Wow, you spotted The Pacific Group a mile away! I couldn't remember the name of the
group, so I didn't mention it.

<p>
Yes, they are very active here in Northern California, particularly in the Contra
Costa County suburb of Walnut Creek. I would allege that almost all of the sexual
abuse I was referring to happened at the hands of members of our local Pacific Group
offshoot called &quot;Nursery.&quot; The guy who harassed me for 3 years was a &quot;Nursery Guy.&quot;

<p>
I will give you a run-down of what Nursery is like here, and you can tell me if it
mirrors the Pacific Group. I think Nursery and Pacific are the same thing. Many of
the older Nursery guys had the same sponsor in Los Angeles, which I always thought
was weird.

<p>
<ul>

<li>
1. They are militant. It's their way, or the highway. The meeting where I got glared
at for using the bathroom during shares? Nursery meeting. The sponsor that told me
to get a job while disabled?  Her husband was a &quot;Nursery guy.&quot; Nursery sponsors
expect their sponsees to do whatever they say, whenever.

<p>
<li>
2. They demean women. Most of their meetings are for men only, although they are
trying to convert young women into the &quot;Nursery way of life.&quot; In mixed meetings, I
have heard Nursery speakers make derogatory jokes about women, and about Al-Anon.
They openly let older members hit on and stalk younger women in &quot;their&quot; mixed
meetings. When I say older I mean over 45, and when I say younger I mean under 20.

<p>
<li>
3. They are in general against their members using other 12-step programs, and most
of them are anti-medication. One woman I knew changed her sobriety date after she
tried Anti-Depressants.

<p>
<li>
4. They spread like a virus. They are constantly starting up new meetings in their
home areas and in new areas, and require that the meeting be run the way they say.
They don't even care if the new area has a population that would likely be averse to
their views. (Example: Nursery members are going to San Francisco meetings to spread
their &quot;gospel&quot; there. I can't think of a place more adverse to this dogma than SF.

<p>
<li>
5. They are taking over young people's meetings, conferences, and round-ups, because
that's where all the young women are. Don't get me started about what happens at YP
events.

<p>
<li>
6. They are the craziest Big Book and 12x12 thumpers I have ever seen. They all
quote it like robots.

<p>
<li>
7. They all share EXACTLY the same way. As soon as a guy shares, if he talks that
certain way, my husband and I know he's a &quot;Nursery Guy.&quot; They are CONSTANTLY beating
fear into people about how if they don't do x, y, or z they are going to die. Crazy!

<p>
<li>
8. They are complete fucking hypocrites! They talk all this big talk in meetings
about &quot;being of service&quot; &quot;hitting their knees&quot; &quot;conceding to their innermost
selves,&quot; but then once the meetings are over they are hitting on underage girls,
they are breaking the law, and engaging in other addictive behaviors. One Nursery
dude distilled and drank Ginger Beer, but, despite the Nursery Doctrine, did not
believe he was relapsing or engaging in risky behavior!

<p>
<li>
9. They are homophobic, so much so that they won't even hold one another's hands at
the end of their meetings when they pray. What a laugh!!
</ul>

<p>
Now that I'm writing this, I have no idea how I took this for as long as I did. AA
said that they were my family now, my healthy family, but they weren't healthy. They
were just as sick or sicker than my origin family. Thank goodness I am getting my
real family back again. My real family isn't going to make me drink, like AA warns!
AA almost made me drink!

<p>
Thanks again. If I think of any other sociological stuff to tell you about Nursery
Group I will email you again.

Hi again, So Done With AA,
<p>
Yes, that sounds like the Pacific Group. The Nursery sounds like just another local name.
(They have so many: Badger Group, Foxhall Group, Midtown Group, Plymouth Group...)
The dead give-away is those older members all having the same sponsor in Los Angeles.
That's the headquarters of
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy and his Pacific Group</a>.

<p>
I'd love to hear more about &quot;The Nursery&quot;.
<p>
Oh, and I would like to get you started on what happens at YP events. Coincidentally,
there is a conversation going on over at the forum about A.A. recruiting in high schools</a>,
and how inappropriate it is, considering how many sex offenders get sentenced to A.A.
meetings by a misguided judge.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Unnamed,
<p>
Yes, that's very wierd. Please dump that sponsor immediately. She sounds like just another
pervert who wants to hear all of the juicy details of other people's sex lives.
That has nothing to do with sobriety.
<p>
And another, more frightening, thought is: What would she do with that information if she got it?
She is not like a Catholic priest who is sworn to secrecy with the most sacred of oaths
on a Bible.
She can do anything from blab your list all over town to call up your former lovers and
try to hit on them, or try to get more information out of them, &quot;for your own good&quot;, of course.

So please dump that sponsor, and have a good day.

<p>
Mister T,
<p>
Please get someone's help to hold the camera and take the picture so you can be in
it in the market, or any, shots. Hitchcock did it, how about you?  I  can't help
myself when a thought hits me I send it along.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bob,
<p>
I've been thinking about that myself. Alas, there are technical problems. I am almost
always alone when I go to feed the geese and ducks, so I have to do the photography myself.
The camera has a timer function where you can tell it to take a picture in say, 60 seconds,
and then get positioned before the shutter snaps. But you cannot predict that the goslings
will come to you in 60 seconds. And running back and forth between the camera and goslings
would scare them off. You have to sit quietly and let them come to you.
<p>
There is a remote control unit for my E-510 camera, which would solve the problem,
but Olympus wants $200 for it, which is
a total rip-off. It's just a small $2 piece of plastic and silicon and an infrared LED.
You get one for free when you buy anybody else's videocam.
That is just another one of the many under-handed
Olympus tricks to suck more money out of their customers.
After you buy the over-priced, over-rated camera body, you find that they
demand $200 more for a hand-held remote control unit,
and $400 for the flash, and you can't buy a battery grip at any price.
Don't buy Olympus. You can get better stuff from Canon, Nikon, or Pentax.
Now that I really know what I'm doing, my next camera will be a used Canon 5D.
<p>
(As it is, such behavior by Olympus has backfired badly. They have gotten such a
bad reputation that nobody will buy their cameras any more.  Olympus has discontinued
their line of digital single-lens-reflex cameras because they weren't selling,
and Olympus was losing money making them. It's over. They still make some smaller
cameras, but I don't recommend them either.)

<p>
I also bought an Olympus RM-1 remote control unit at Goodwill for a couple of bucks. It works
with a lot of other Olympus cameras, but not mine. (Heaven forbid the Olympus customers could solve
their problem that cheaply.)

<p>
So anyway, I'm still working on the problem.
I would like to put the camera on a tripod and get some shots of the goslings and ducklings and
me together.

It is often said that AA will spoil your drinking and I say the Orange-Papers will
spoil your meetings.  I thought I would never attend another XA meeting but the
picnic lasted about five hours and NA picnics include a meeting while AA picnics do
not, if memory serves me.  I am in the &quot;new comers rescue league&quot; but I do not feel
it appropriate to rescue during an XA meeting or activity.   Probably half of the
fifty people at the meeting were new to me.  When I heard members say NA has kept
them clean I had the urge to tell them they did it themselves but I doubt they would
listen.

Yes, I would feel strange about going to such functions too. It's hard to listen to all
of the Pollyanna jabber about how wonderful &quot;This Program&quot;
works without speaking up and telling the truth.

Undoubtedly, U took along time to find out this stuff in order to prove others

things that is right in stead of what is wrong,,, Of course it is easier to find the

can,,&quot;Judge not lest you be judged&quot; I'm sure you have justified your actions,,thats
o.k.&#8212;  I can only believe that the people around you are probably miserable they
more than likely can't do anything right either&#8212; You are an intelligent person I'm

Hello Rodney,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It is a great demonstration of a bunch of the standard A.A. misinformation
and slogans.
<p>
<ol>
<li> A.A. is not THE ONLY HELP OUT THERE. A.A. is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">a complete failure that kills more alcoholics
than it saves</a>.
And there are many other better ways to recover. In fact, A.A. is not &quot;help&quot; or &quot;a way to recover&quot;.
A.A. doesn't work.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;Judge not lest you be judged&quot;
</font><br>
That is a standard response that cults use to dodge criticism for wrong-doing.

If you do not &quot;judge&quot; quack medicine and fraud, then all that you will get for a cure is quack
medicine and fraud.

<p><li>
Claiming that critics of A.A. have not invented anything better to help sick people is another standard
A.A. lie to avoid the truth, which is that there are many good ways to recover.

Start here, and you will get all of the lists of what helps, and what has worked for others:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

<p><li>
Lastly, the blatant anti-intellectualism of A.A. is very unbecoming, and it is
 not helpful to people in recovery:
<font color="black">&quot;Lets not hope your to smart for your on good...&quot;</font>

</ol>
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Read your so-called papers. Funny,  seems that AA is killing everyone that
it comes in contact with yet you  can't shut them down ('them' being AA)
because anyone or group that  has any power is out to protect AA hence foiling
your tireless effort to  save the masses of boozehounds that yearn to be
free from alcohol. Yeah,  whatever. What a sorry excuse to validate your warped
sense of  reality.
<p>

<font color="blue">

Hello, TBLight,
<p>
Scientology and the Moonies hurt everyone they come into contact with too, and I can't shut them
down either.
<p>
And <i>who</i> is &quot;protecting&quot; A.A.? And why?

Oh, and just so you can save your breath  so to speak, I am not in AA.
<p>

Seems that your common theme in your angry  responses is that if someone
disagrees with you or exposes you for the paranoid  ass that you potray in

an AA minion sent out to destroy you.
<p>

 I am sure you can  pick out some

So what is your problem, Steve? You seem to be in a real bad mood, and you haven't said

You haven't even presented any facts about anything.

promoting cult religion and quack medicine as a cure for addictions?
How about quackery as a cure for cancer or tuberculosis or AIDS or coronary disease?

Subject:  	Re: Your anti-AA doctrine<br>

<p>
So maybe the AA Big Book is not the answer in itself but it does help
because I can interact with others who have quit.
<p>
Isn't that what it is all about... learning from others who have quit? How
else are we going to end up in the same place at the same time to talk about
it?...and it gives me people to hang out with who don't drink...
<p>
Even here, your slamming AA just makes me want to know how you quit without
it...but in the end it is because of AA that I can interact with you at
all...
<p>
LOL.
<p>
The bottom line is that in a society that &quot;sells&quot; alcohol all the time, it
is very hard to quit. You have to go against the &quot;norm&quot; and that is not
easy. You have to ignore movies and co-workers and radio and billboard ads.
You have to constantly fight against the current. Of course success will be
tough. But it is not AA that is at fault, it is our society's values.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Rhonda,
<p>
You are still
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank">assuming facts not in evidence</a>:
namely, that A.A. actually works, and that people
at an A.A. meeting can give you real help and good advice in quitting and staying quit.
But
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. does not work</a>, and the advice or &quot;help&quot; that you get there is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">more likely to make you fail than succeed</a>.
<p>
I notice that you did not answer the question about what the success rate of A.A. is.
<p>
Just having a few sober people around doesn't prove that A.A. works.
You can find a few sober people anywhere.

<p>
You talk about learning from others, but what are you learning? Some old cult religion nonsense
from the nineteen-thirties?
That surrendering to something else will solve your problems? That confessing your sins will
make you quit drinking?
A.A. is long on such crazy talk but short on success.
Cult religion is not a cure for addictions.
<p>
A.A. really isn't much different from Scientology. They also claim to have a never-fails cure
for addictions, called Narconon, and it is also the jabber of a madman. Narconon is completely
ineffective and even very harmful. They do a lot of steam baths and sweats and funny diets
and megadoses of vitamins.
The Surgeon General has warned that the Narconon routine is nonsense, and it doesn't work
and it is very dangerous to your health and may kill you.
But Scientology still has some convinced members who swear that Scientology saved their lives.
Every cult has such poster children and true believers.

<p>
Both A.A. and Scientology have the same evidence that their methods really work: NONE.

<p>
How I quit drinking was I decided that I was not going to die that way.
A doctor told me, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot; I thought it over for a while, and drank
on it some more, and thought about it some more, and then finally decided to quit. So I did.

I could hardly believe my eyes when I read just a very small portion of
your hate paper.......Who in hell do you think you are?  I can't imagine
anyone with half a brain that would take your ramblings seriously.

<p>
If it were'nt for Bill and Dr. Bob, I'd still be drinking.  Since AA
doesn't seek publicity (it shies away from most publicity, fortune or fame), and
since it is a non-religious organization, I can't for the life of me see
why you  are targeting Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob and AA.  I do not think Bill
Wilson  was insane nor do I think he used AA as a springboard for his own
fame.  He  spent over half his life being dedicated to AA and helping others.

<p>
I doubt seriously if you have many believers in what you write.  It is  so
off the wall as to be laughable.  I assure you you won't convince the  some
2 million plus members all around the world.  We all owe our sobriety  to
AA.

<p>
People like you keep trying to rock the boat &#8212; you WON'T succeed!

<p>
Shame on you for your false statements and hate!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Plwood,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Congratulations on your quitting drinking.
<p>
You are obviously very upset at hearing some criticism of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Perhaps you would like to supply some evidence in defense of A.A.?
Like what is that actual A.A. success rate?
How good is A.A. at sobering up the alcoholics, really?

<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">
<blockquote>
<font color="#7F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
Or even several years later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">here</a>.)
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p><br>
Then you could look at the doctors' reports of what A.A. really does to people. They found that A.A.:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">raises the rate of rearrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">increases the costs of hospitalization</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
</ul>
<p>
The fact that you don't believe that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was insane</a>,
or that
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">Wilson robbed A.A. of
everything that he could get</a>,
or that Bill Wilson really devoted the second half of his life to
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">selling Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion</a>,
only proves that you believe what you wish to believe.
Like they say in A.A., &quot;Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.&quot;

Hello Terrance,

I have a question about what your life status was like when you finally

you do drink or not drink?

Hello, UNNAMED,
<p>
In the end, I got so sick that I couldn't work, and couldn't finish jobs,
and lost jobs, and then the utilities were turned
off, and then I got evicted and was homeless. I was so sick that work deadlines were irrelevant.

<p>
So I actually finally quit drinking while homeless.

After going through all of that, I find it funny when some A.A. members start telling me that I
wasn't really an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking without A.A.

Harry  Bingham Stamp honoring an unsung hero who resisted our

<h3>
Just an interesting piece of  evidence of the curious behavior of  the
Roosevelt administration  toward the Jews during WWII :
</h3>
</center>
<p>

A few months ago, Secretary of  State Colin Powell gave a  posthumous

award for &quot;constructive  dissent&quot; to Hiram (or Harry) Bingham, IV.  For

over fifty years, the State  Department resisted any attempt to  honor

Bingham. For them he was an  insubordinate member of the US  diplomatic

service, a dangerous maverick  who was eventually demoted. Now,  after

his death, he has been  officially recognized as a  hero.

Bingham came from an  illustrious family. His father (on whom  the

fictional character Indiana  Jones was based) was the archeologist  who

unearthed the Inca City of  Machu Picchu, Peru, in 1911. Harry  entered

the US diplomatic service and,  in 1939, was posted to Marseilles,

France, as American  Vice-Consul.

<p>
The USA was then neutral and,  not wishing to annoy Marshal  Petain's

puppet Vichy regime, President  Roosevelt's government ordered  its

representatives in Marseilles  not to grant visas to any Jews.  Bingham

found this policy immoral and,  risking his career, did all in his power to
undermine  it.
<p>
In defiance of his bosses in  Washington , he granted over 2,500 USA

visas to Jewish and other  refugees, including the artists Marc  Chagall

and Max Ernst and the family  of the writer Thomas Mann. He  also

sheltered Jews in his  Marseilles home, and obtained forged  identity

papers to help Jews in their  dangerous journeys across Europe .  He

worked with the French  underground to smuggle Jews out of France  into

Franco's Spain or across the  Mediterranean and even contributed  to

their expenses out of his own  pocket. In 1941, Washington  lost

patience with him. He was sent  to Argentina, where later he  continued

to annoy his superiors by  reporting on the movements of Nazi war  criminals.

<p>
Eventually, he was forced out  of the American diplomatic service  completely.

<p>
Bingham died almost penniless  in 1988. Little was known of  his

extraordinary activities until  his son found some letters in  his

belongings after his death. He  has now been honored by many groups  and

organizations including the  United Nations and the State of  Israel.

<p>
Please honor his memory  and re-send  this.

Hello Henry,
<p>
Thanks for the message. Yes, I'll pass it on. People like Harry Bingham deserve to be honored.
He reminds me of Oskar Schindler, who was made famous by the great movie <i>Schindler's List</i>.
Maybe someday somebody will make a movie about Harry Bingham and his work and sacrifices to help the Jews
to escape from the Nazis.
<p>
Oh, and doesn't this story also tell us that we cannot trust politicians or bureaucrats?
President Roosevelt's administration didn't want to annoy Marshal Petain's
Nazi puppet Vichy regime? Well why not?
<p>
And then Bingham's superiors gave him orders to ignore the Jews, and sacrifice them for political convenience?
Now that's cold, really cold.
<p>
And what did it profit the politicians in Washington? In spite of all of the
<a href="orange-rroot300.html" target="_blank">cowardly attempts to appease Adolf Hitler</a>,
they could not manage to avoid getting into Word War Two.

Subject:  	Re: Nail on head<br>

<p>
Thanks for the reply. I'll try out some SMART meetings. I'd looked them up before
when i saw it mentioned in your pages, and there are some in my area.

<p>
Also, not sure if you've ever heard of this branch of AA, but it seems much more up
my alley, so I'll probably give some of these meetings a try as
well:
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160701033605/http://www.agnosticaanyc.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.agnosticaanyc.org/</a>

<p>
They seem to take seriously the &quot;only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to
stop drinking&quot; line. And their FAQ says
<p>
 &quot;Q. Do you folks work the steps?<br>
 A. Some do, some don't...&quot;.
<p>
 And,<br>
 &quot;Q. How do these groups make use of the Big Book?<br>
 A. Frankly, we don't use it very often.
Most of our members find Chapter 4 (&quot;We Agnostics&quot;)
to be particularly condescending and not helpful to their sobriety....&quot;

<p>
Sounds like an AA I could feel more comfortable with.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again,
Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I'll have to check that Agnostic A.A. out in detail. I like the comments
about the chapter &quot;We Agnostics&quot;, and not reading the <i>Big Book</i> much.
I could get along with them too. They are obviously trying to think for themselves.

<p>
The main problem that I have with any subsect of A.A. is that they
still call themselves a &quot;12-Step&quot; group, and they still at least give lip service to
the whole Alcoholics Anonymous thing. But the 12 Steps are just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's practices for
indoctrinating and brainwashing new converts</a>. No matter how they twist the Steps around and say that
they are only worshipping &quot;Good Orderly Direction&quot;,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. still does not
have an actual working program for sobriety</a>.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day now.

So how bad was your experience in AA that you feel the need to blast it?

Hello Jane,
<p>
Thanks for the question. It wasn't that I had such a terrible experience in Alcoholics Anonymous.
That isn't why I criticize A.A. I criticize Alcoholics Anonymous because it is a fraud and a hoax and

In fact,
