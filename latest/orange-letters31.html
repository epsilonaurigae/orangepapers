<a name="suicide"> </a>
Date:  	Sun, December 11, 2005 1:45 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Mairtin O'M&quot; 

<p>

Dear Sir/ Madam,
<p>
I have enjoyed reading your material on the net concerning the AA cult.
I spent 8 years of my life in this evil organisation. In that time I
have seen many young men commit suicide, a direct result I believe of
the program. I brought this subject up at meetings but of course they
tried to put me down.
<p>
When I shared about being beaten by my parents as a child I was told to
make amends to them! I just laughed loudly.
<p>
I have also seen sponsors, who think they're great spiritual masters,
exploit women for sex. This is very common.
<p>
It is a difficult problem, as members believe deep down that they are
right, that AA is perfect. Most disturbing of all is that they believe
they will die if they leave AA, hence the appalling suicide rate. I live
in Dublin, Ireland, but I believe AA is the same everywhere. Keep up the
good work in exposing this evil cult.
<p>
Yours<br>
Mairtin O M

Dear Orange,
<p>
Thanks for your reply. I have read more of your articles and found them
very enjoyable.
<p>
I don't know whether you cover this: I have found, over the 8 years I
wasted in the AA Cult, that many members have a bizarre, empty
expression. Or their body language contradicts what they're saying. For
example it is not unusual to hear a member say, 'I'm very happy in AA'
while the facial expression is blank or almost tearful.
<p>
I should have fled when I went to my first meeting. The chairman talked
like an insane religious fruit cake. Naive and in great pain, desperate
for love and acceptance, I went to shake his hand. His grip was weak and
his face was.. well I can only say chilling.
<p>
I feel now that my rational thoughts were suppressed. If I had any
doubts about AA, I'd assume it was my problem. The problem (as I thought
it was then) was that I was seeing a wonderful counselor, who
encouraged me to work out my own problems. She did not have any opinion
of AA or influence my decision to leave AA. I worked it out my self.
I have been away from AA and its drones for 4 months and I feel great! I
am so much more open to people. I feel a warmth towards and from people.
Unlike the cold fucked up members of AA, whom I genuinely pity. Before i
left I tried to persuade others to leave. Guess what? They said, &quot;you
can't do it alone&quot; Yes I can. And I have. And i now have genuine
friends. It is good to be free and it is good to think. Thanks Orange
for confirming what I already knew. Though I don't think I could have
put it as well as you.
<p>
Have a merry Christmas (Oh AA members don't like to use the word merry here)<br>
And a very Thinking New Year.<br>
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Mairtin,
<p>
Thanks for all of the thanks and compliments, and you have a Merry Christmas,

<p>
Oh, and about that blank look thing that so many members have,
and the denial of feelings,
that just seems to go with the territory.
That seems to be common to so many cults. I don't have a specific cult test
item for that, but it is reflected in
a whole bunch of the common cult characteristics:

<li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial" target="newwin80">82. Lying. Denial of the truth. Reversal of reality. Rationalization and Denial.</a>
</ul>
<p>
All of that can leave a person in a place where he is saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I'm happy; very, very happy. I'm not unhappy, no not me.
That would be wrong. So I'm happy; very, very, happy.&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange
<p>
Gosh. Just been reading some of the hate mail you've been getting from
the holy serene people of AA. It just confirms to me that this is a
disgusting group of hate filled religious fanatics. AA people hate, and
I mean hate, any opinion other than their own.
<p>
The really funny part about their letters is that they attack you and
offer no evidence that AA works. And when they lose the argument they
say stuff like 'well I will leave it there' or 'we'll end this now'.
<p>
Keep up the good work. You have many friends. You may get hate mail, but
your friends will keep mailing too!

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
Hope you don't mind me writing to you so often. Please don't worry at
all about writing back. I know you get many, many letters. I am in the
early stages of recovery from the AA cult and I find it very helpful to
write to you. As I read more of your articles I am reminded of the shear
stupidity of AA and the mind boggling arrogance of sponsors.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's quite alright. I like hearing from people from all over the world,
to hear what things are like over there.
</font>
<p>

<a name="suicide2"> </a>
I only had one sponsor in the 8 years of my AA experience. He lasted the
first two years. And he dumped me! Why? Well I can only guess. I
discovered that he had DOZENS of sponsees! All of which gave him money
and gifts, except me (I think my guess as to why he dumped me is a
pretty good one). He was also screwing every female he could get his
hands on. It was awful to see young women coming in, lonely, tired,
seeking love and warmth and support, used and abused to gratify this
excuse for a man; then discarded and dumped, only to go back out
drinking, disillusioned.

<p>
And what cuts me up inside and makes cry even right now, is that many
years ago one of his sponsees told me that there was something wrong
with this bastard and AA. That young man, along with at least two others
he sponsored committed suicide.

<p>
I just dismissed him. If I could say something to him now I'd say, 'I'm
sorry. I am so sorry for not believing you.' At his funeral we, AA
crackpots, stood around his grave and said the serenity prayer. The only
sane person in that circle was in a grave. How lonely must have been his
last days. Knowing the truth of AA, a truth he could not deny. He had no
friends, only AA 'friends' and therefore his truth was denied by
everyone in his world. How lonely must that be?

<p>
I only just escaped with my life. I tried to hang myself. Luckily I have
good upper body strength and pulled myself back up in the attic,
to safety. I also took an overdose and awoke in a hospital pissed off that
I was still alive.

<p>
I was so close to death and continued to listen to the backward 'logic'
of my so-called sponsor. Oh Orange it is good to be free. In the Big
Book it talks of everyone being in a disaster and coming together in AA
to freedom and safety. Well I was in a disaster. And it was AA. I just
feel baffled sometimes. How could I have been taken in for so long! Why
did I keep suppressing the alarm bells in my head!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well that's what the
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="newwin82"><i>Phobia Induction</i></a> does.
Phobia Induction
is a very powerful cult technique, and it makes people even afraid to think
the wrong thoughts, or else something really bad will happen to them.
People actually end up practicing self-censorship, and stopping themselves
from thinking &quot;the wrong thoughts&quot;.
</font>
<p>
But I am not so hard on myself. I was desperate for love and warmth. I
grew up with little or no love, and thought AA could give me the
affection I craved.

<p>
Also while in AA I covered my body with tattoos. I was denying my pain
and numb. I see now that it manifested itself in tattoos, skulls, death,
knives. My body is destroyed, but that's OK. My mind isn't.
I still meet AA members. (I'm only out of AA four months, but the
brainwashed crap in my head has been slowly broken down over the last
two years.) I will chat with those on the outskirts. I try not to be
too anti-AA to them. I don't wish to hurt them. But I will be honest. As
for those members in the inner circle... these I detest. When they say
hello I make it a must that I look into their eyes and grin at them:
'Hard look pal, ye nearly had me, not quite. Hey guess what I am still
sober. Fuck you!'

<p>
Thanks Orange for letting me get this off my chest. You are a good man.<br>
I believe history will say that Agent Orange was the beginning of the
end for Steppism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's too flattering. It would be nice to think so, but I don't think
that just one stake through the heart of the vampire is going to keep it down...
</font>
<p>

I will be writing to locally elected councellers (politicians) on many
of the matters you have discussed. I'm going to play my part.

<p>

Date:  	Mon, December 26, 2005 12:42<br>

<p>
Hi Orange
<p>
I for to tell you in my letters that I also did an ACoA course in
Dublin. That really messed me up. At one meeting I was sharing some
really deep painful stuff about my childhood. After a minute the
so-called counsellor abruptly turn away from me and in a loud happy
voice said, &quot;And how are you today Mary!&quot; Also this 'counsellor' I note
was a binman (Trash collecter) a year earlier! So what kind of a degree
did he get! ACoA almost drove me to suicide. One girl was forced to
admit that her Dad was alcoholic. She was saying, &quot;Maybe he was an
alcoholic. I saw him drinking in the house once.&quot; Oh ye, a raving alco he!
<p>
A real counsellor with many years training helped me get through the
experience of ACoA and AA.
<p>
Life now is getting better. It is a little wierd. I walk out the door
and that wicked 'higher power' is no longer watching me. I got sober in
spite of AA, not because of it.
<p>
I would like to tell you how an ACoA course works in Ireland. It might be
different in the US; I'm not sure. There are three stages (it ain't free,
by the way!).

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1<br>
this is like a class room setting. Three teachers write all sorts of
crap on the whiteboard. The alcoholic is this and that. You are this and
that. You are damaged. You are powerless. Your whole family should be on
the program.

<p>
<li>
2<br>
This is group therapy. It is (or was in my experience) a cruel
brainwashing program to get people on a 12-step program for life. Many
people went on this course because of their cruel childhood. By the end
of it many were alcoholics! The 'counsellor' was so false it was
unbelievable!

<p>
<li>
3<br>
This stage I did not do. But it is a 12step workshop.
</ul>

<p>
I fled after stage 2 in a state of acute depression to my doctor. I am
so thankful to my doctor and counsellor for the help and support they
gave me through the horror of my childhood, AA and ACoA.

<p>
Warm Regards<br>
Mairtin O M

Hi Mairtin,

Date:  	Sat, December 10, 2005 12:54 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Katie M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	fascinating<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Thank you for the best education I have received to date.

<p>
I am 44 years old and have had 12 steps and labels shoved down my throat
for nearly 25 years.  I recently learned about REBT and SMART Recovery,
which changed my life overnight.  I was sober 15 years (on my own) until
a year ago last July when my dad died, my marriage was plummeting and I
started taking Xanax, un-prescribed, that I ordered off the Internet.  I
functioned and felt better although I was depressed.  I didn't lose my
job but had thoughts of suicide.  When my husband discovered I was
&quot;self-medicating&quot; I told him, &quot;no problem, I will stop&quot;.  It was 24
hours later that I discovered I was addicted.  I spent 10 days of
intense withdrawals getting clean.

<p>
Having family members in AA, I was immediately shamed into believing
that my year of taking Xanax was a relapse and that the 15 sober years
prior were wiped off the face of my existence.  I was told I was in a
&quot;dry&quot; drunk all those years because I didn't go to AA and that my
relapse was inevitable.  That was the most shameful &quot;incomprehensible
demoralization&quot; I have ever experienced and felt in my life.  I was
given an ultimatum by my husband to go to AA and &quot;work a program&quot; or he
would leave me.  I had been sentenced to a life of 12 step dogma and I
didn't see a reason to live.

<p>
After 6 months of living hell in AA I finally decided that I had to take
control of my life back, with or without my husband, or kill myself.  I
remembered that I was successful at staying sober on my own and was
immediately &quot;enlightened&quot;.  I took my life back in the space of a
minute.

<p>
I am resentful and angry that my emotional problems around my father's
death and my failing marriage were dismissed.  &quot;Go to AA and all your
problems will be solved&quot;. I was suicidal for crying out loud!  The fact
that I was self medicating was a big red flag.  I see that now but
nobody else does.  It's the strangest phenomenon to me and who can I
tell who will actually listen?

<p>
I'm telling you my story because I wonder if you've included the
percentage of people who have been damaged by AA and the 12 step
brainwashing scheme.

<p>
I have &quot;come to believe&quot; that the reason I had always felt guilty and
different was because I wasn't allowed to be a thinking, feeling human
being in my own right.  I was taught to believe that my own thoughts
didn't count because of the disease factor or that I was immoral for not
conforming to society's way, which is of course, &quot;AA is the only way&quot;.
I would have done anything not to go to AA in the late '80's, including
get sober, which I did successfully and still am.  I am learning to
validate myself and get the help and &quot;education&quot; I need.  I am no longer
suicidal.  I have no need to medicate because I am free, finally, from a
belief that once had taken away my fundamental rights.

<p>
I have a long way to go to undo the damage 25 years of brainwashing can
inflict but today there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it's not
a train.

<p>
Thank you again, Orange.  Thank you.

<p>
Katie in Seattle, WA

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Katie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.

<p>
Sorry to hear about your suffering. I trust that you are feeling better
now that you have escaped from the madhouse.

<p>
Again, it is just so obvious that A.A. is the opposite of good counseling
or good psychotherapy. I keep getting these stories about suicides and near-suicides,
enough to curl your hair.
<p>
You said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I wonder if you've included the
percentage of people who have been damaged by AA and the 12 step
brainwashing scheme.&quot;<br>
</font>
Alas, no. I don't know what the percentage is. I don't even have a hint,
other than to know that it is much greater than zero.
To the best of my knowledge, no
one has ever done a good valid study of psychological damage caused by 12-Step
programs. That is, a
<a href="orange-letters26.html#Randomized_Longitudinal" target="newwin86">Randomized
Longitidinal Controlled Study</a>, which is about
the only kind of test that would be valid and would clearly reveal such damage.
I doubt if such a test will ever be done, because members of 12-Step groups
do not, in general, want to be psychoanalyzed every few months for several years
to see how much their minds have deteriorated under the influence of cult practices.
<p>
More than three years ago, I wrote a web page about
<a href="orange-statistics.html" target="newwin88">The Problem With Statistics: Who Is Killing Themselves?</a>
There, I talked about the near-impossibility of collecting valid statistics about
the suicides in A.A. and N.A.. Unfortunately, that page is becoming more and more
relevant, as these stories about suicide in the groups keep coming in.
<p>
I have lots of anecdotal evidence, but that doesn't give us any reliable numbers
or valid statistics.
<p>
The only study I have found that relates to the mental states of A.A. members
is
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Lemanski" target="newwin89">
one that found that the majority of them were mentally disturbed</a>,
with some of them being very disturbed and even downright psychotic.
But that study was a one-time thing. That supplies no information about whether
the 12-Step program made them worse over time. I suspect that it does, but I
can't prove it.
<p>


<p>
By the way, while you are detoxing from the cult influences, you might
enjoy reading
<a href="orange-top10.html#Kasl" target="newwin91">Charlotte Kasl</a> and
<a href="orange-top10.html#Rapping" target="newwin92">Elaine Rapping</a>.
Both are on my &quot;Top 10&quot; list of books.
Both are women who have clear thinking, constructive outlooks, and a
lot to say about recovery without a cult, and even recovery from the
12-Step cult.
<p>
Enjoy, and have a good day. And Merry Christmas.

Dear Agent Orange:
<p>
I took a look at your web site. Nice work. I hope you
found what have been looking for. As far as AA is concerned it seems to
have worked out pretty well for me personally. However, I don't feel
compelled to recruit for the &quot;cult&quot; or anybody lese for that matter. It
really is a program of attraction rather than promotion. I am also one
of those counselor types. AA is a spiritual program. It is a religious
and God based, God centered approach. No question. It has fundamentalist
Christian roots. So what is the big deal?

Hello James Gregg,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
Every day, you see people with those
court slips that they have to get signed, <i>or else</i>,
and you maintain that A.A. is just
&quot;a program of attraction rather than promotion&quot;?
And then what about the propaganda mill of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="newwin24">Vaillant</a>,
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="newwin25">Moos</a>,
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="newwin26">Humphreys</a>,
and their friends who seem to have dedicated their
lives to promoting the 12-Step cult by manufacturing a stream of deceptive
misinformation?
<p>
The fact that you enjoy A.A. meetings does not mean that they are good
for other people or that they work to make people get sober.<br>
The fact that you quit drinking does not show that the 12-Step program actually works.

<p>
The roots of Alcoholics Anonymous are Frank Buchman's cult religion.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.
</blockquote>
<p>

Buchmanism is not fundamentalist Christianity and never was. Please read
&quot;<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin21">The Religious Roots of the
Twelve Steps</a>&quot; again.
Frank Buchman occasionally claimed that his religion was something like
&quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot;,
but, when it was politically convenient for him to do so,
<a href="orange-rroot450.html#not_Christian" target="newwin22">he happily dumped Jesus Christ</a>
and declared that 
Moral Re-Armament was quite compatible with Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam.
<p>
A contemporary minister, <a href="orange-rroot900.html" target="newwin20">Rev. Ironside</a>,
noticed that Frank Buchman's religion was so totally un-Christian that Buchman
would not have had to change any of his dogma even if Jesus Christ had never
been born.
</font>
<p>

I also have a MA in Clinical Psychology and counsel in a drug and
alcohol program. We use the Minnesota Model; as such we utilize AA and
NA, Rational Recovery, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Rational Emotive
Therapy, Secular Recovery, Zen Buddhism, Yoga, meditation, spirituality,
virtually anything &#8212; to help people quell the &quot;Beast&quot;. Good luck. Great
Web site. Frank Buchman was sure peculiar.

<p>

Well, with your MA in Clinical Psychology, you should certainly understand what
the following terms mean:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study. (You know, those medically-valid
tests that show that 12-Step treatment is completely ineffective and just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin11">raises the death rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin12">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and that a whole year of A.A. is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="newwin13">no more effective than having
a doctor talk to the patient for just one hour</a>,
telling him to quit drinking or he'll die.)

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="newwin14">
Confusion of Correlation with Cause and Effect</a>. (Like assuming that A.A.
meetings make people quit drinking, or that 12-Step programs work to make
people quit drinking, or that the 12 Steps cause people to
quit drinking.)

<p>
<li> Cult Religion (like <a href="orange-cult.html" target="newwin10">what Alcoholics Anonymous is</a>.)
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="newwin14">Rate of
Spontaneous Remission</a>. (You know, that funny number that is
curiously
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg" target="newwin15">equal to the
success rate of treatment programs</a>.)
</ol>

<p>
And yes, I know that &quot;Minnesota Model&quot; means that the
Hazelden Foundation slapped
their coat of paint on Alcoholics Anonymous, and then passed it off as
&quot;treatment&quot; for the &quot;spiritual disease&quot; of alcoholism.
<p>
Above all, the single most important question is, &quot;What is your success rate?&quot;
Out of each thousand clients who start that &quot;Minnesota Model&quot;
treatment program, how many of them are clean and sober a year later?
Two years later? Five years? Ten years?
<p>
Remember that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#spontaneous" target="newwin16">
the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics</a> is approximately
5% per year, and that groups of clients who actually want to quit, and
are motivated to quit, should score much higher, even without treatment.
(No excuses are allowed, and no qualifiers like &quot;Well, they didn't
<i>really</i> try,&quot; or &quot;They didn't <i>thoroughly</i> follow
our path&quot;.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Adam F.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	your site<br>

<p>

Hey there. I saw your site and I am in awe. Clearly you've put a
tremendous amount of work into it, and I'm not writing to try to sway
your opinion of anything. It just seems to me the feelings expressed on
your site are based on your negative experiences with some people within
AA, and not with the program of AA itself. To me, AA is like life
itself, it's what you make of it (and likewise, what the people
attending your group make it). We are just life-forms spinning on a rock
which orbits a star, plain and simple. Any problems we face are of our
own making.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Adam,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
My criticism is most assuredly of the A.A. program itself. If my disagreement
were only about
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="newwin17">one bad counselor</a>, then I could laugh that off. He is irrelevant
in the big scheme of things. (And he is gone to prison.)
But A.A. is a pervasive problem.
<p>
To argue that &quot;AA is like life
itself, it's what you make of it&quot;, is bad logic. That is like arguing that
&quot;Hydrogen bombs are neither good nor bad; it is the use you make of them that counts.&quot;
(<a href="orange-letters11.html#McLuhan" target="newwin19">Marshall McLuhan</a>
dispensed with that argument 35 or 40 years ago.)
Things have inherent natures and inherent effects. The Alcoholics Anonymous program
is inherently damaging to peoples' psyches.
<p>
And not all problems are of our own making. That is an oversimplification.

</font>
<p>

Likewise, AA is just a program. Any positive or negative experiences
encountered within are the design of people, not the program itself.
Your site actually reminds of one a good friend of mine runs
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://christianburner.com/" target="newwin20">
http://christianburner.com/</a>

&#8212; which is why likening AA to an organized
religion bothers me, it's simply not the case. Of course, people always
have the ability to screw up good things...

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is classic
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="newwin08">Minimization and Denial</a>,
something that alcoholics are said to be good at.
A.A. is not &quot;just a program&quot; any more than Scientology and
the Moonies are &quot;just a program&quot;.
<p>
A.A. is most assuredly an organized religion, just like the Moonies and Scientology.
The headquarters of the organization is in the offices of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Incorporated, in New York City, and in the offices of the General Service
Organization, also in New York City. A.A. has a Board of Trustees, paid executives,
a national council, state and regional councils, and even a council that approves
literature and decides whether it is kosher enough to get the church's holy seal of approval
&#8212; &quot;Council-Approved Literature&quot;.
A.A. is organized and has always been organized, ever since Bill Wilson incorporated
it in 1940.
<p>
As far as it being a religion, of course it is a religion. Read the web page on
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="newwin07"><i>&quot;It's Spiritual, Not Religious&quot;</i></a>.
</font>
<p>

At any rate, hopefully you site does not discourage someone from at
least trying AA because I can guarantee the common experience is not as
filled with dishonest people as yours has been. The program does indeed
help many people and I hope you're not preventing the potential it holds
from reaching someone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but there is no evidence that the program helps a lot of people.
Just because you get a bunch of people into the rooms does not mean that
they have been helped.
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant, who is a member of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., spent 8 years testing A.A. on
alcoholics. His conclusion: that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin06">A.A. was completely
ineffective, and the death rate of 3% per year was &quot;appalling&quot;</a>.
</font>
<p>

Take care &#8212;

<p>

Yeh, you have a good day too, and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
Wow, is this part of a doctoral thesis?  It is very well written and it's obvious
that you have extensively researched your topic.  It feels good to know that I have
a chance at recovery without AA.  I never felt comfortable going to AA.  It felt
more like a punishment for being a drug addict.  When I would tell family members
that AA wasn't for me they would roll their eyes because they assumed I was just
lying so I could continue to use.  I felt I was in a no win situation. The treatment
centers told my family that a 12 step program was the only way and that if I balked
at it I was being manipulative.  I stayed up until almost 3am to read this article
because it puts into words what I've felt all along about AA.  Thank you for giving
me a voice.  I feel free now to get better on MY terms.

<p>
Julie

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Julie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the flattering comments.
<p>
Alas, no, I don't think I will get a Ph.D. out of this. That would be nice,
but most universities sort of expect you to get a B.A. before you get a Ph.D.... :-)<br>
(That's what happens when you drop out of college in the psychedelic 60's.)
<p>
I'm glad that you got a small enlightenment or liberation from reading my stuff.
And yes, you most assuredly can recover on your own. In fact, that is how most
successful people do it. Don't miss
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="newwin03">the statement from
the Harvard Medical School</a>
about how the majority of successful recovered alcoholics and addicts do it alone.
With alcoholics it was 4 out of 5. With addicts, they were more vague, and
didn't give exact numbers. But the odds are definitely on our side.
<p>
Oh, and I always recommend that anybody who is in recovery go read about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin02">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
Understanding how he works, and not getting fooled any more by his yammering and complaining,
has been a huge help for me in staying off of alcohol and cigarettes.
<p>
It seems to me that getting unaddicted happens in two distinct phases.
First, there is just physical withdrawal. That can be very uncomfortable, even extremely
painful, but it is usually over in a few weeks at most.
And then the mind games start, and go on for years.
That's where the old lizard brain is always whispering,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, we've got it under control now. We can have just one now &#8212;
just a little hit &#8212; just a little feel-good because we are young and
strong and smart and we can handle it now... It'll be okay.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Not getting fooled by him is everything in staying clean and sober after you detox.
<p>
(Or maybe it's a 'her' in your case. I don't know, do women experience a female lizard
brain yammering at them?)

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life. And a Merry Christmas.

From:  	Wylie<br>
Subject:  	Good Day<br>

<p>
My name is Wylie and I just wanted express myself towards you and your
web-site. This is not hate mail for it is love mail. I am part of A.A.
and at first I took offense to your viewpoints and to your perspectives.
At first a thought fuck you but then I set aside my feelings and said I
love you. Being part of A.A. today has helped into a better way of life
in which I can choose to love or to hate. Of course you may not agree
with me, but I do not agree with you either. That doesn't matter though.
What matters is that although many people have different viewpoints and
different ways of living their lives, we need to understand and accept
people for who they are and what they do. I know that you probibly do
not agree, but I say let A.A. be what it is and let A.A. do what it
does. From my experience A.A. has helped many people despite its
failures. My question is why does it matter if A.A. is successful or
not? Why does it matter if A.A. is wrong and full of lies?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Wylie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Why does it matter whether A.A. is successful or not?<br>
Why does it matter if A.A. is wrong and full of lies?<br>
Well because people are dying over this stuff, that's why.
<p>
Foisting ineffective quack medicine on sick people is a despicable crime.
It causes people to die.
</font>
<p>

Why does what
Agent Orange or Wylie have to say matter? So that others can disagree or
agree. I do not judge you based on your viewpoints and the way that you
live your life, you are a human being. We may not agree but that does'nt
matter what matters is that I do not know you but I love you, I accept
that whatever has caused you to have hatred towards A.A. be taken in
consideration and that what was expressed here today can be taken
seriously or not as long as we can set aside our individual motives and
ideas and come together as a whole and help each-other live our lives,
that is all A.A. has done for me. It has shown me love, which I did not
have and it has shown me a way of living my life through certain
guidelines. More power to you if you can just accept me as a person and
not by what I say, or what I do, our how I live my life. Thanks I love
You.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wylie, if you really love the addicts and alcoholics then you should get to
work trying to get them better treatment, something that actually works,
just for a change.
<p>
You can start off by going to the
<a href="orange-action.html" target="newwin01"><i>Action Alley</i></a>
web page and sending emails to your Congressman (or woman)
and two Senators, telling them not to waste any money on 12-Step treatment, because
it does not work. That will leave the money available for some better treatment.
And that will be doing the alcoholics and addicts a big favor.
<p>
Have a good day, and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;James B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	My Theory of AA<br>

<p>
Agent Orange

<p>
The more distance I get from AA, the more I see how much I was caught in its spell.
I have concluded that AA is just a life long route of cognitive dissonance, meaning
that if you want to spend your whole life agonisingly trying to fit yourself into a
doctrine &#8212; then AA is for you.  That's what happened to me:  kept reassessing my
past, my future, my present, into the AA way &#8212; and when, inevitably I disagreed with
the AA way, I felt guilt, shame, and &#8212; quite often &#8212; terror.  That to me is the most
senseless and cruel existence.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again James,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. What you just described sounds exactly like this cult test item:
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_new_identity" target="newwin99">75. New Identity &#8212;
Redefinition of Self &#8212; Revision of Personal History</a>.
And
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_new_identity" target="newwin98">the answer for A.A. is here</a>

</font>
<p>

What has helped me immensely is learning about CBT.  I am well versed now in how my
emotional problems develop, maintain, and can be eased away.  A great tool.  And it
has also opened me up to the idea of personal beliefs, how sincere and well thought
out (mostly) they are within each individual, and how they are essential in viewing
the world and others.  So, how would AA have it?  To destroy all those personal
beliefs and replace it, with shaming and guilt force, with Bill Wilson's view of
himself and the world.  People replace old beliefs with new ones all the time &#8212;
sadly AA only prescribes &quot;AA approved&quot; beliefs &#8212; so the end result is, yes, a
reframed mind, a brainwashed individual.  Horrible &#8212; and I feel for those who are so
deep in that they have signed away their complex identities, often forsaking goals,
creativity, empathy for others, all through a process of &quot;tough love&quot; and fear.

<p>
<font color="blue">
For those readers not familiar with the term, CBT is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
That is what
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="newwin96">SMART</a> teaches.
</font>
<p>

Far fetched?  Probably.  I am not a psychologist &#8212; but I SAW how AA functioned and I
believe what I have stated to be true, in reference to what I have learnt with CBT
theories.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You don't have to be a professional psychologist to notice that something is cultish.
</font>
<p>

Some love AA beliefs &#8212; and they will be the happy ones.  But they should understand
that what they are doing to others is essentially psychological torture and
personality reshaping.  They should be made AWARE of what happens in AA before they
choose, or choose not to, approach newcomers.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, but brother are they ever in denial about it.

<p>

Pop psychology rant over!

<p>
Three years sober very soon.

<p>
Keep on it agent.

<p>
TTT.
<a name="memory"> </a>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Three years! Good, very good. Congratulations!
The hardest part is over. It slowly gets easier, and the healing continues.
<p>
And there really is healing still continuing.
I just had my 5th anniversary, and guess what happened? At 4 years, 11 and a half
months, my memory for details started working again.
I picked up a book, and my mind immediately
said, &quot;Page 153.&quot;
I realized that when I had to put the book down the previous day, I had made a mental note
of the page number where I was at. And I actually remembered it the next day.
Then I realized that it had happened a couple of other times in the previous two
weeks. And it hit me like a thunderbolt that my memory was working again.
<p>
It's been more than 5 years since I've been able to do that.
My short-term memory was severely damaged by alcohol. When I quit drinking,
my memory was so shot that I couldn't even remember things like
having talked to a fellow 12 hours earlier.
<p>
And I couldn't remember faces at all. It's called &quot;prosopagnosia&quot;.
I tried and tried to just close my eyes and picture the faces of
Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, and Dan Rather. (I picked them because they
were faces I had been seeing for 20 years.) Impossible. There just wasn't
anything there. I would watch the network news in the evening, and when a commercial
came on, I would close my eyes and try to picture the face of the news anchor
whom I just saw. I couldn't do it. No picture. Nothing.
<p>
It got really embarrassing and frustrating when I would talk to a pretty girl
and not realize that she was the same person as I had talked to 15 minutes earlier.
She had changed her blouse and brushed her hair, and I couldn't recognize her.
<p>
It took 9 months before my brain recovered enough that suddenly one day I could
clearly visualize Rather, Jennings, and Brokaw.
Oh do I remember that day. Happy day.
<p>
After that, the improvements have been coming slowly. The fog dissipates and things
get clearer very slowly.
<p>
It's been a long road back, but the improvement is still continuing.
Thank goodness.
<p>
Okay, that's my psychology rant for the day.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	RE: your site

<p>
Christmas is a religious holiday, don't you know? I find it odd you would
wish anyone a merry one.
<p>
<font color="blue">
What, are you pulling Bill Wilson's stunt and declaring that everyone who rejects
his crazy cult religion is either an agnostic or an atheist?
For your information, I am neither. I just don't like cults that hurt people.
So I have no problem with wishing people a merry Christmas.
</font>
<p>

Anyway, I think you've outsmarted yourself on this one. Your mind is full of
logic, yet you are full of hate and anger. If you are ok with living that
way, who am I to judge. My problem lies with the fact that the AA you detail
on your site is simply not the AA I know.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you enjoy your meetings. That doesn't mean that they help other people.
You should read
<a href="orange-letters.html" target="newwin40">the other letters</a> that come into this web site.
There are
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors" target="newwin41">a zillion horror stories</a>
from people who don't find A.A. or N.A. meetings to be nice or helpful.
Your favorite meeting might be a pleasant little social
club, but other people have found A.A. meetings to be hell on earth.
And that is part of the real A.A. experience too.
</font>
<p>
<a name="what_works"> </a>
So my last question for you is: let's assume for a moment you are right, AA
and all 12-step programs are a fallacy and do more harm than good. What is
your solution then? I see none on your site. Doesn't that put you right on
par with them, selling negativity with no solution?

<p>
<font color="blue">
You see none?

<p>
Oh by the way, to accuse someone of &quot;selling negativity with no

of saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You can't criticise our phony voodoo medicine unless

Of course I can and should criticize quack medicine.

You're website was certainly instrumental in my leaving AA and thank

Subject:  	Suggestion<br>

<p>
Hi,<br>
I came across your site, and I'm really impressed. I have a suggestion
though &#8212; maybe you could put in a google &quot;search this site&quot; box. There's
so much information to wade through.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Tara,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
I'm still looking into a search engine. I want one, but it's tricky.
It is actually a double problem: First a search engine to index and search web pages,
and secondly, pointing to labels. That is, so many of the pages are so large that
just pointing at the web page would still leave people lost. I need to have a named
anchor for every paragraph or two. I might have to write a computer program to
create them and insert them into the pages,
and then I need a specialized search engine that would point people
to the most recent named anchor before a specific thing.
</font>
<p>
<a name="suicide4"> </a>
I had an unpleasant experience with AA. A year ago, I nearly committed
suicide while I was in the program. I had relapsed, and there were
things running through my head like &quot;I have a disease, it's never going
to be cured, I have to live like this forever, there's no other way...&quot;
well, you get the idea. I felt powerless, and AA only reinforced that. I
felt like a victim of unjust circumstances, and I didn't want to be
alive anymore, since being an alcoholic was too hard.
<p>
Of course, the truth was that I was an immature little brat who liked to
get wasted and play on the internet while sponging off my parents, and
perhaps get into my car and cruise around (that's what got me into AA).
<p>
After I got out of the hospital, I realized that something was VERY
wrong, and I began the process of AA deprogramming. I realized that
while all of my friends were graduating from college, I was barely a
sophomore and my grades were terrible, mostly because I was too hungover
to go to class or I'd rather drink than do reading.
<p>
This was my fault, of course. It seems so simple now.
<p>
The way that I recovered is I up and moved to Hawaii to go to school. I
needed a change, and I needed to not be financially dependent on my
parents, so if I missed class or got bad grades, it was my own money and
time I was wasting. Perhaps this move would be drastic for some, but
that's the beauty of it: it's what worked for me, even if it wouldn't
work for a single other human being. The idea of a canned prescription
for ending an addiction is ridiculous because we are all so individualized.

<p>
Like I was saying at first (sorry I got off topic), a search tool would
be awesome. I was trying to find stuff on AA and suicide.

<p>
Thanks for listening!<br>
Tara

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh, you are quite welcome, Tara. Thanks again for the letter, and the story.
And congratulations on your victory, and saving your own life.
<p>
Your story reminds me of myself in a few ways. In the last year of my
drinking and smoking career, I too despaired of ever recovering:
<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Why quit smoking and drinking when you know that you are
just going to relapse again? You always backslid before, so you know
that you will again.
What's the point in trying? It's over. It's hopeless.
Might as well just stay stoned until you die. Kill your pain as best you
can until the bitter end comes.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>
And yet, somehow, one day I just snapped out of it. It had a lot to do
with a doctor telling me to quit drinking or I would die, but I still
just snapped out of it one day.
<p>
That's why I, like you, think that the whole A.A. &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;
thing kills a lot more alcoholics than it ever helps.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway, and have a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	question<br>

<p>

I've been reading through your orange papers website, and I find it all
very interesting. I am an alcoholic and just recently started attending
AA meetings, and have been having skepticism about the program and it's
startling resemblence to a cult. I was just wondering about a few questions:
<ul>
<li>
a) Are you yourself an alcoholic, and have you ever gone to AA meetings
or attempted the AA program?
<li>
b) What was your motivation for compiling the 'orange papers'?
<li>
c) Do you ever get criticized or lambasted, by AA's or non AA's, for
creating the site?
</ul>

<p>

Thanks.<br>
-Chris

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Chris,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.

<p>
And the answers are:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
An alcoholic? Oh yes. I drank too much for 18 or 20 years.
Been to A.A. meetings? Oh yes. Too many.
Read <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>.

<p>
<li>
Motivation? I just wanted to get the truth out. When I went through &quot;treatment&quot;,
I was shocked to find that it was a total fraud where cult religion was being
sold as &quot;treatment&quot; for a deadly illness.

<p>
<li>
Have I ever been criticized or lambasted? Oh yes, a zillion times. I get lots of
hate mail, which convinces me of how right I am in saying that A.A. is a cult.
<a href="orange-letters.html">Read the files of letters</a>.
Some of the more &quot;spiritual&quot; 12-Steppers
have even recommended that I relapse by doing things
like swallowing a fistful of downers and washing them down with a 40-ouncer.

Oh well, have a good day anyway, and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster

<p>

Hi A.,

<p>

I hang out on a Yahoogroup, &quot;LifeRing Secular Recovery&quot;  ==&gt;<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/LSRmail/">
http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/LSRmail/</a><br>

A member posted a link to your interesting essay
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;
which I enjoyed
reading.  The LSR philosophy &#8212; to the extent that there is much
philosophy &#8212; is eclectic, minimalist, humanistic, and secular.  However,
several of us are REBT-CBT junkies, so much of your essay resonated with
me, especially your compendium of distorted thoughts we addicts use to
rationalize drinking and using.  It must have been a lot of work compiling
and organizing those examples of self-talk so methodically.  I am
downloading a copy as a &quot;keeper.&quot;  Thanks!

<p>

There were two issues you  didn't deal with very directly, and I would be
curious as to your take on them.  BTW, I have no particular answers of my
own.  It's an ongoing &quot;meditation.&quot;

<p>

(1)  Using your &quot;base brain&quot; model, why can large numbers of people (most
people?) use (some types of) drugs &quot;recreationally,&quot;  while others use them
destructively, and only a minority (10-20%) use them addictively?

<p>

(2) What is it with recovering drunks whose cravings have pronounced
longevity and who chronically lapse and relapse and never &quot;get it&quot; or go
through years of misery before they &quot;get it&quot;? Is it &#8212; as you seem to
suggest &#8212; just a &quot;cognitive&quot; problem of being ignorant of &quot;self talk&quot; and
how to deal with it? However, keep in mind that most drunks never
encounter the concept of AVERT, REBT or any other primarily cognitive
approaches to recovery. But from that population of &quot;cognitive virgins,&quot;
some are still going to &quot;get it&quot;, struggle for awhile and choose permanent
abstinence. Others are going to drag the process out for a long, painful
time.

<p>

Any thoughts?

<p>

Thanks again for a good read.

<p>

Aloha,<br>
Rex

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Rex,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments, and thanks for some great questions.
I have a bunch of thoughts on them. Pardon me for taking so long to
answer, but I had to really think these questions over for a while.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
You asked,
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
Using your &quot;base brain&quot; model, why can large numbers of people (most
people?) use (some types of) drugs &quot;recreationally,&quot;  while others use them
destructively, and only a minority (10-20%) use them addictively?
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I suspect that it is both nature and nurture &#8212; that is, it is
genetic, and psychological and physical damage to the brain
also plays a major role. 
<ul>

<p><li>
The genetic factor is a wild card. It is a
truism that in alcoholics' families, one or a few of the children turn into
raging alcoholics just like one of their parents, and the other
children don't. (I was the one in my family who followed in my
father's footsteps, in spite of having seen what it did to him,
and swearing that it wouldn't get me like it got him, and in spite
of having spent my youth doing every drug except alcohol.)
<p>
The level of detail in the genetic code never ceases to amaze me.
When I was a child, I had a dental problem with my upper left fang
where the baby tooth didn't come out and allow the adult tooth to descend
and move into its proper position. And lo and behold, my son had exactly
the same problem, with the upper left fang, and only with that one tooth.
Who would have imagined that the genetic code is so specific and so detailed
that it
contains tooth-by-tooth descriptions of how the teeth will come in?
<p>
Then, for the last five years, I have been feeding the Canada Geese down
at the river. I noticed that some of the gozlings are quite brave and
will take bread right out of your fingers. But others just won't do it.
They just won't get that close to you, even when they are really hungry.
In a clutch of four eggs, often two come out brave and two are conservative
and cautious. It's quite a show to watch the changes the timid ones
go through. I hold out a piece of bread and one of the little guys
wants it. His head bobs up and down as he thinks about it, and he sort
of takes a step towards me, and he's really debating being that daring,
but he just can't quite do it. Then one of his braver siblings rushes in
and grabs the bread. Then you can read his little mind as he thinks,
&quot;Gosh, shucks! I missed out! But next time, I'll be brave and I'll rush in there and
get it.&quot; So I hold out another piece, and suddenly he goes back to being
timid and really wanting it, and humming and hawing and thinking about
it, but he just can't quite do it. So one of the braver siblings rushes in
and grabs it. Finally, the parents take pity on their
more cautious offspring, and take the bread out of my hands and drop it in
front of the timid gozlings so that they get to eat too.
<p>
Now we are talking about very young gozlings here, only days or a few weeks out
of the egg shell. But they already have distinct personalities. They were
obviously born that way. It's in the genetic code.
<p>
It strikes me that mother nature doesn't like to put all of her eggs in one
basket. (Pun intended.) Mother nature is hedging her bets. In a situation where
it's &quot;get it while you can, and devil take the hindmost&quot;, the brave, perhaps
reckless, youngsters will get to eat, and the cautious, slow ones may starve.
But where the situation is a trap, the reckless ones may become lunch for a clever
predator, while the cautious ones will survive. Either way, some of them
will live to continue the species.
<p>
I believe that the variation that you see between children in one family,
where some become alcoholics and some don't, works on a similar principle.

<p><li>
Where physical damage to the brain plays a major role in alcoholism,
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis">the damage is caused by
abuse during childhood</a>.
Follow that link to an article that described some research that
I think is critically important in understanding addiction:
<p>
<blockquote>
Researchers found that childhood sexual abuse and stress caused permanent
changes in a part of the brain called the cerebellar vermis:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Damage to this area of the brain may cause an individual to be
particularly irritable, and to seek external means, such as drugs or
alcohol, to quell this irritability,&quot; Anderson said in a statement.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
They did not research other kinds of abuse, like physical abuse and terrorism
by an abusive parent, but I believe that the effect is going to be the same.

<p><li>
And then there is psychology. Different people have different mind-sets.
Some people are so unhappy that they really are self-destructive.

<p><li>
Undoubtedly, many alcoholics and drug addicts suffer from mental illnesses
or physical illnesses that they are trying to fix by self-medicating.
I think that Bill Wilson falls into this category &#8212; he was insane
before he ever took his first drink. He was narcissistic, neurotically
insecure, and bitterly unhappy since childhood.
When he first felt the effects of alcohol, at the age of 21, it was love at
first sight. Here was something that could make him feel good like he
had been unable to do since childhood.

<p><li>
And then there is something else very important going on.
Different drugs affect different people in different ways.
What is a safe drug for one person may be a fatally dangerous drug for
another person.
<p>
The whole government policy of labeling some drugs &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; and others
as &quot;safe drugs&quot; is wrong. Really wrong &#8212; pig-headedly stupid wrong.
Different drugs hit different people in different ways.
<p>
I am a prime example of that. As a sort of scientific experiment, I just had to
try all of the drugs in the world, just to see what they were like.
I almost succeeded; I almost got every last one of them. I only failed to get
ibogaine from Africa and ayahuasca from South America. I skipped PCP simply
because friends told me about it and it didn't sound like a horse tranquilizer
was worth the bother. I missed STP, and didn't get enough DMT to get off on
it. But otherwise I got them all, and gave them all a good test.
<p>
I have shot heroin and cocaine. In fact, the first time I ever had cocaine I
was shooting <i>pure</i> cocaine straight from South America. Wow! What a rush!
<p>
Now every drug in the world had a shot at me. They all had their chance to
get me.
<p>
What did I end up addicted to?
<p>
Tobacco and alcohol. The &quot;old people's drugs&quot;,
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Gracie">as Gracie Slick called them</a>.
<p>
Why them? Who knows?... other than that I am obviously carrying the gene for
alcoholism that I got from my father. 
<p>
You would think that heroin and cocaine would be more addicting than alcohol, wouldn't
you? Not to me they aren't.
<p>
You know, it's funny how I can look at cocaine and say, &quot;It's just a buzz. You know,
a fantastic, really intense buzz, but it's still just a buzz. And heroin is just a warm
rush, and then you vomit, and then you itch all over.
Not worth much in the big scheme of things, really.&quot;
<p>
I actually decided not to be a junky while rushing on heroin. I had just shot it,
and was considering devoting my whole life to being a junkie.
(That is how insidious the stuff is &#8212; half a dozen times of shooting it, and you
are thinking about devoting your life to it.)
The answer I got from within was,
&quot;No, it isn't as good a high as LSD, and it's too expensive, and the people who have
been doing it for a while are too weird.&quot;
So I just walked away from it, and haven't done it in 30 years.

<p>
But I can't be so detached about alcohol. It too is just a buzz, just a warm buzz,
but once I get started, I want to make it my lifestyle.
I guess you could say that I never got married to heroin, but I married alcohol.
<p>
Now how can it be that my vulnerability to various drugs is so vastly different?
I think it's just that different drugs hit different people in different ways.
We have our own peculiar biochemistries and psychological makeups.
<p>
I have an ex-junkie friend who is okay with a beer now and then, but he says that he
just can't touch opiates at all, not even the legal, legitimate pain pills that
his doctor gives him, because just a taste of opiates awakens the dragon, and the
next thing you know, he's in trouble and out looking for the dealer.
<p>
I am exactly the opposite. I would literally be better off smoking opium or shooting
heroin than having a few drinks of alcohol. I would be able to shrug off and forget
about the opiates, and go do something else the next day. That isn't how it works
with alcohol.

<p><li>
And then there is the random factor. I remember a program on National Public Radio
talking about pathologically violent people. The visiting expert was saying that we
can explain half of the cases of such extreme insane violence &#8212; it was caused by
childhood abuse, genetics, and such things.
But the other half of the cases are inexplicable.
The expert said that maybe the vicious criminal
caught a virus when he was a baby, and it made his brain grow slightly differently,
or maybe his mother dropped him on his head, or something.
But we just don't know what caused it.
Half of the cases were simply inexplicable.
<p>
I suspect that something similar may be going on in the children of alcoholics &#8212;
and in the children of non-alcoholics, when all but one of the kids is okay with
alcohol, and one is killed by it. 
</ul>

<p><li>
Next question:
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
What is it with recovering drunks whose cravings have pronounced
longevity and who chronically lapse and relapse and never &quot;get it&quot; or go
through years of misery before they &quot;get it&quot;? Is it &#8212; as you seem to
suggest &#8212; just a &quot;cognitive&quot; problem of being ignorant of &quot;self talk&quot; and
how to deal with it? However, keep in mind that most drunks never
encounter the concept of AVERT, REBT or any other primarily cognitive
approaches to recovery. But from that population of &quot;cognitive virgins,&quot;
some are still going to &quot;get it&quot;, struggle for awhile and choose permanent
abstinence. Others are going to drag the process out for a long, painful
time.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think that there is a lot going on there. I get the hint of a feeling that you
think they don't know what is going on. Bill Wilson wrote some stupid things about
alcoholics needing to
&quot;be rigorously honest&quot; and not &quot;have resentments&quot;
which were actually half true.
I think that some alcoholics know full well what is going on, and they have
some suppressed anger and rage at not being able to have it all &#8212; at not being
able to get high and feel good as much as they wish.
So they decide that they are just going to go ahead and do it anyway, consequences be damned.
They may or may not be honest with themselves about what is going on.
I know that some of the hard-core alcoholics have an attitude like,
&quot;The doctor says that it will kill me, but he won't say when.&quot; And then they
laugh and have another drink and another hit of dope.
Some of them have consciously chosen to drink themselves to death, and they do.

<p>
Alcoholics in A.A. are not totally ignorant of the principles of cognitive approaches;
they just use different language. I was explaining the lizard brain idea to one A.A.
member and he immediately started describing &quot;the weasle&quot; which the guys in his
group said they had in the backs of their heads. And that slimy little weasle would
lie to them and tell them that it was okay to have a drink.
One guy talked about how he was going to grab that damn weasle and nail it to the wall.

<p>
<a name="hes_right"> </a>
I find the idea of the lizard brain addiction monster to be very helpful in avoiding
relapses. That is, I have consciously decided that I really don't want to smoke or
drink any more because it causes me too much pain. But that little monster comes along
and insists that just a little fun will really be okay. Understanding 
what is going on, and understanding how totally wrong his goofy logic is, helps me a lot.
I ain't gonna get fooled again.
<p>
But that technique is of no use to someone who does not want to quit drinking (or smoking,
or doping, or whatever).
Actually wanting to quit and change your life is a whole different issue.
Someone who is determined to stay stoned all of the time will say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;So ol' lizard brain says that I should have another drink and another
hit of dope? Well he's right!&quot;
</font>

<p>
Deciding to quit your addiction is a matter of deciding that it isn't any fun any more,
and that the pain outweighs the gain. Some people never get there. They may die before
they want to quit.
<p>
Other people despair of ever being able to quit, and don't think it is worth trying.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I always relapsed and back-slid before; why should I try again? It'll just
be the same.&quot;
</font>
<p>
They decide to just stay stoned and kill the pain until the bitter end. (That's how I
nearly died.) Again, understanding the lizard brain is of no help in that situation.
What is required is deciding to live, and deciding to succeed in quitting, no matter
what. 
<p>
(And I don't know how to teach that. What is the magic that suddenly makes someone
decide to live?)

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;Steve M.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Cults<br>
Date:  	Tue, December 20, 2005 10:35<br>

<p>

Its an Interesting document, and I am sure that there are many truths to
your opinion!
<p>
However you have some basic facts wrong in your document, concerning the
SGI,
and the Gohonzon.
<p>
The SGI Is no longer a part of Nichirin Shosho. The laity were
excommunicated in 1991,
by the priests, who are showing cultish tendencies. In fact The SGI
headed by Daisaku Ikeda
now have some 15 million members worldwide and are a respected and
peaceful organization.
<p>
They can not be described by any of the 100 tests of a cult in your
document.
<p>
The UK organisation was subject of a thorough investigating by a team of
Independent researchers,
headed by Oxford university, And the SGI opened its doors and filing
cabinets to allow full and
complete access, to over 5000 members, a large sample of whom were
interviewed.
<p>
The results are published and make fascinating reading.
<p>
I suggest you find a copy, as it is truly independent, before you assert
that the SGI is a cult.

<p>

Although we are no longer associated with the Priesthood, who
undoubtedly had become corrupt,
<p>
They are not worshipping the Gohonzon as an object, but showing respect
to the text inscribed on it.
<p>
The Gohonzon is worthy of such respect as it contains a path to
enlightenment.
<p>
In essence it is a mirror to your life showing you how to follow the
correct path to happiness.

<p>

Although many members individuals chant for material gain, it is a path
to enlightenment never the less.
<p>
We know material things will not bring happiness, but if people are
sincerely chanting for these things, they still have a long way to go .
<p>
Sometimes you have to take the wrong path to learn the right one. Humans
often learn better from their mistakes.

<p>

If you want to remove any association from Nichirin Shoshu and the SGI,
I would be a lot happier, and you will not be telling a lie

<p>
A happy follower, but not a slave<br>
Steve M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Steve,
<p>

A cult does not stop being a cult just because they have a civil war and
split the organization in two. I know all about the squabbles and
the denunciation of the priests and the destruction of the Budokan in Tokyo.

<p>
When I was giving it a try, back in 1971, Nichirin Shoshu and Soka Gakai
were one and the same.
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Gohonzon">I am reporting what I actually
saw and experienced first-hand</a>, not a lie.
&quot;Nichirin Shoshu&quot; was the name on the front of the church that I went to.
It was just outside of Denver, in a suburb. I'm a little hazy on the exact
location; maybe it was in or near Golden or Aurora.

<p>
So now you are using the name &quot;Soka Gakai&quot;, and not &quot;Nichirin Shoshu&quot;?
<p>
You claim that the organization is no longer cultish, but you just admitted
that some people still chant for material gain.
By what crazy stretch of the imagination could anybody think that chanting to
a printed scroll will get them money or sex or any other material gain?
That is just a stupid superstitious occult practice.

<p>
And no, what I saw was not people chanting to the text inscribed in it. In fact,
I could never get a translation of the scroll, so nobody was
chanting to the meaning of the scroll.
There were no translations of anything available. You were just supposed to
chant all of that stuff for hours and hours without knowing what it meant.

<p>
When I was in it, I asked about, where was the Buddhism, and the teachings
about enlightenment?
Buddha's Eight-fold Path, and all of that?
The group leader said that I could chant for anything,
&quot;even enlightenment&quot;, if that was what I wanted, but he
obviously regarded me as crazy for
wanting enlightenment when I could chant for money or a new car....

<p>
There was simply no teaching of Buddhism, none whatsoever.
They called it Buddhism but it had nothing to do with Buddha or his teachings.
I never once heard any talk about Buddha or his wisdom.
It was all about chanting &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&quot; day and night.

<p>
What about the rest of what I reported?
<p>
What about,
&quot;At every church get-together, people stand up and give testimonials
about all of the wonderful things they have gotten by chanting to a
Gohonzon, and then
they talk about what they are going to chant for next: a better job,
more money, a new car, a house, or whatever.&quot;
<p>
And what about, &quot;They also believe that they can achieve world peace if one third of
the people on Earth chant their chant.&quot;
<p>
What about the Jumping Gohonzons, that allegedly jumped down off of the wall of a burning
monastery, and hopped out of there to keep from burning up?
<p>
What's the current story about all of that stuff?

<p>
I could go on and on, talking about the neurotic followers I encountered there,
and the number two guy in the church, who talked about how he had previously
practiced black magic,
summoning up demons at crossroads at midnight with candles in a pentagram,
until he summoned up something that scared him, so he quit that and joined
Nichiren Shoshu.
And he declared that the Pope of the Catholic Church was like the ugliest
guy in the world, so full of hate that his features were distorted.
<p>
It was quite an education.

<p>
I really don't have the time to search for a copy of that report in England.
Perhaps you can find a copy and send it to me?
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Dear Agent O.

<p>
I have told so many A.A. members that if they can stand
the truth to go to your site and show me where its wrong.

<p>
NONE have.

<p>
Also I emailed G.A.O. in New York just to see if Bill W got any money
from the Big Book  and sure as shit, he got lots. As a matter of fact,
even though he's dead, his estate got something like 135K last year and
will recieve royalties for 3 or 4 more...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Is that all? Interesting. Actually, I think that the number they gave you was
just for the <i>Big Book</i>. His estate also gets money from all of the other
things that he wrote, including:
<ol>
<li> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
<li> <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
<li> <i>As Bill Sees It</i>,
<li> and probably dribs and drabs for Bill's pieces out of the Grapevine that are
being republished in things like books of daily meditations.
</ol>
<p>
The last number I had heard was that Bill's wife Lois was getting over $900,000
per year at the time of her death. That whole estate went on to Lois Wilson's
heirs, because Bill had left his estate to his wife Lois and his mistress Helen Wynn,
(90% for Lois, 10% for Helen) and little or nothing to his own relatives.

</font>
<p>

Have you heard of Ibogaine?<br>
if not do a quick search.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yeh. Ibogaine is one of the very few psychedelics that I was never able to get and
test. (Mind you, I'm not looking for it now. I'm saving my remaining brain
cells for marriage.)
</font>
<p>

and I am not a health food nut, Maybe a little nutty.

<p>

Once I get my pay pal issue resolved I will make a donation
because the truth is worth a lot!!

*Subject:  * 	AA<br>
*From:  * 	GERALD P.<br>

<p>
Hi: I have been an active member of Alcoholics Anonymous for 3 years and
must confess your seething critique of my program on the internet has,
quite frankly, almost sent me back drinking. The picture of AA you
painted, makes me feel that if I continue this program I will more than
likely die premarurely.This is not sarcasm because as an
Alcoholic, with a possible fatal disease, any program I choose is a
matter of life and death.This email is not intended to contest your
findings, but I have surrendered to this program and now am wondering
whether or not I am really in a cult. My main purpose is to stay clean
and sober and attempt to enjoy the short remaining years of my life ( I
am 59 years old). I really don't care if it is AA or any other &quot;proven&quot;
workable program out there &#8212; whatever it takes I will investigate and
act accordingly . I live in Barrie Ontario Canada. Please return your
comments as I am confused and need help!!

<p>

Thanks<br>

Hello Gerry,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
First off, there is no reason for you to go back to drinking. Life
is not a matter of &quot;Either I will join a cult religion or else I will drink
myself to death.&quot; You can live a happy and sane life without either alcohol
or cult religion.
<p>
<li>
Secondly, A.A. is not &quot;your program&quot;. It is <i>their</i> program, something that they
are shoving on you. If you surrendered control of your life to them and
their program, then take control back.
<p>
<li>
Third, you don't have &quot;a possible fatal disease&quot;. Alcoholism is not a disease.
It is a bad habit of drinking too much alcohol. You can stop it just like you 
can stop other bad habits and compulsive behaviors.
You don't need to go to meetings for the rest of your life to stop biting your
nails or stop eating fatty cholestrol-loaded foods.
It may not be easy to stop such habitual behavior, but actually, since
you have already done it, you know that you can do it.
In fact, you don't need to stop drinking, because you already have stopped drinking.

<p>
<li>
And you don't really need &quot;a program&quot;. You just change your habits and then
go do something else with your life. If you really must go to meetings, try
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://www.smartrecovery.org/">SMART</a>
or
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://www.sossobriety.org/">SOS</a>.
<p>
<li> And if you want some more company or companionship, try the online chat
groups like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://smartrecovery.infopop.cc/eve/ubb.x">
SMART</a>
and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://www.unhooked.com/chat/index.html">
LifeRing</a>.
<p>
<li>
Also look at the beginning of <a href="orange-links.html">the links page</a>
for more sobriety groups, organizations, and aids.
<p>
<li>
You might also want to check out this list of discussions of what works,
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works">here</a>.

<p>
<li>
Coincidentally, I am also 59, and I also intend to enjoy my remaining years.
Being sick from alcohol and tobacco is definitely not part of the plan.

</ul>
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Date:  	Thu, December 22, 2005 10:38<br>
From:  	&quot;R.T.B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	some stuff you might be interested in<br>

<p>

I came across this in the 12 step coercion watch group, it's a study
just done by the veterans affair group.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://www.healthcentral.com/newsdetail/408/528477.html">
http://www.healthcentral.com/newsdetail/408/528477.html</a>

<p>
The article didn't provide any numbers so I went looking for the actual
study and I found a more complete synopsis with actual data here.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214536/http://www1.va.gov/resdev/news/research_highlights/alcoholism-101105.cfm">
http://www1.va.gov/resdev/news/research_highlights/alcoholism-101105.cfm</a>

<p>
i put a message up on the group with the above link. This is what I wrote:

<p>
<center>
<table width="96%" border="5" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
A lot of questions come up about this study like this quote that comes
up towards the end of the paper:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'One limitation of the study, said the authors, is that people who join
and participate faithfully in AA may be a more motivated group of
individuals to begin with, and it could be this trait and not AA, per
se, that is responsible for their better outcomes. The authors wrote
that nonetheless, they &quot;believe the findings reflect the real-world
effectiveness of participation in AA.&quot;'
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Why would they put such a statement in? You don't know who is or who isn't
motivated, nor could you ever really know. The statement just seems so
out of left field.

<p>
According to the study, 57% of the participants who attended AA alone
&quot;stayed sober&quot; as opposed to 50% who &quot;stayed sober&quot; only recieving
&quot;treatment&quot; alone.

<p>
That's only a 7% spread. That's not a big endorsment of AA in and of
itself. And what was the &quot;treatment&quot; anyway?

<p>
And then there is this statement:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;people who entered AA soon after they first sought professional help
were more likely to stay involved with AA than those who delayed joining
the group until after their first year of treatment. Those who stayed
more involved had a better chance of being free of alcohol problems at
1-, 3-, 8- and 16-year follow-ups than those who attended fewer meetings
or were involved for less time.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can assume from the first sentence of the paragraph that people may
have dropped out of AA. Did they stay in the study? Did they decide to
just recieve the &quot;treatment&quot; that was provided by the study or did they
just drop out? If they did just &quot;drop out&quot;, never to be seen again (I'm
just assuming this of coarse), how do they know whether or not those
individuals stayed sober? What exactly do they mean by &quot;more involved&quot;?
Is it 2 meetings per week? 5 meetings per week? 2 meetings per day?

<p>
&quot;Overall, 65% of those who initially took part in both treatment and AA
were free of alcohol problems at 16 years&quot; (paraphrased)

<p>

That would be a pretty good endorsement for AA. Why wasn't this all over
the news? I only heard about it from this group. Did anybody out there
hear about it from anywhere else? or see it on TV?

Hi Rob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I have a similar take on that article.
It is just another piece of propaganda manufactured by the Rudolf Moos and Keith
Humphreys team at the Palo Alto Veteran's Administration Center and
Stanford University. I keep running into their garbage again and again.
Look <a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2">here</a> for more.
They run a busy propaganda mill, constantly cranking out those
unscientific &quot;studies&quot; that declare that Alcoholics Anonymous works great
and saves zillions of alcoholics. I have a large bibliography of their stuff.

<p>
I have never seen them do a single scientifically valid study,
or a single medically valid study, like a
randomized longitudinal controlled study. It's always their bogus, twisted
misinterpretations of a few facts &#8212; genuine propaganda.
<p>
That first quote is a classic. And the line it ends with is pure wishful
thinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
One limitation of the study, said the authors, is that people who join
and participate faithfully in AA may be a more motivated group of
individuals to begin with, and it could be this trait and not AA, per se,
that is responsible for their better outcomes. The authors wrote
that nonetheless, they &quot;believe the findings reflect the real-world
effectiveness of participation in AA.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In giving us their beliefs about their favorite religious group,
the authors of that paper (Rudolf Moos and Bernice Moos)
have made their document into a religious
apology, not a scientific paper about the treatment of alcoholism.
Beliefs are, after all, just beliefs, and they prove nothing (other than
that the believers are screwy in the head).
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
(The Heaven's Gate cult also sincerely believed that their practices were
effective for getting into Heaven, too. Heck, they even took their
experiment all the way to its logical conclusion, and tried to go to
Heaven, and they still didn't prove that their beliefs were true.)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's sad, really, that the treatment of alcoholism has degenerated into
&quot;Well, we <i>believe</i> that it works&quot; and the Veteran's Administration
actually funds such bogus cult activities.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
In true science, you say, &quot;Well, let's see what the truth is. Let's see what kind
of a test or experiment we can do to reveal the true facts.&quot;<br>
<li>
In propaganda, you say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We already know what we want the truth to be. Let's see
what we can do to fool other people into believing that it is the truth.&quot;
</font>
</ul>

<p>
Other problems with that so-called &quot;study&quot; include:
<ol>
<p>
<li> The clients were not randomly chosen &#8212; they were self-selected. The people who
were strongly motivated to quit drinking and save their own lives did so, regardless
of Alcoholics Anonymous or treatment.
<p>
<li> As you noticed, the follow-up was bogus and uneven. The people who
stayed in the A.A.-based program submitted more information about themselves over the
years, and those who moved on and couldn't be found did not. Moos cannot
just assume that all of the wanderers who left A.A. stayed drunk.
Nevertheless, Moos wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Those who beat their addiction but dropped out from AA were more likely
to resume drinking than those who stayed involved with the group.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh really? How could he know that?
How could he compute that number when he couldn't find the drop-outs
who moved on? (And those old veterans do a lot of moving on. I know. I'm an old vet
and my friends are all over the map.)

<p>
<li>
While he was doing his follow-up, Moos apparently did not ask any of the other
important questions like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;How many people committed suicide?&quot;<br>
</font>
Did the A.A. group have a much higher suicide rate? Does suicide count as dying sober?
<p>
What about re-arrests, imprisonment, and other legal troubles?
Does 10 years in prison count as years of sobriety?
<p>
What about mental health? Were the A.A. &quot;faithful&quot; believers
crazier than the other alcoholics?
<p>
<a href="orange-letters14.html#study_questions" target="newwin40">
Here is my list of questions I would like to see asked</a>, to determine whether
A.A. and its 12 Steps improve people's lives.

<p>
<li> Moos noticed that spontaneous remission existed, but then tried to ignore it
in coming to the conclusion that &quot;A.A.&quot; works:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Irrespective of whether or not individuals obtained help, their
alcohol-related functioning, life context, and coping improved. However,
individuals who obtained help (AA or treatment) in the first year
improved more and were more likely to achieve stable remission than
those who did not. Nevertheless, the factors associated with stable
remission were comparable for individuals who did and those who did
not obtain timely help.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What a bunch of double-talk. The first sentence admits that spontaneous
remission was happening. The second sentence says that the A.A. group improved
more. The third sentence declares that those who recovered and those who did not
recover were equivalent groups &#8212; that &quot;the factors associated with stable
remission were comparable&quot;. That is obviously untrue. Some people wanted to
quit drinking enough to really do it, and the rest didn't. <i><b>Motivation</b></i>
is the single most important &quot;factor&quot; in determining whether
someone will quit drinking and stay quit.
That factor wasn't equal in all three groups (A.A. only, treatment only,
or A.A. plus treatment) because the groups were self-selected. The patients
themselves decided how much involvement with the program they wanted.

<p>
The obvious truth is that those who most intensely desired to quit drinking
did so, and also &quot;worked a strong program&quot; and participated in A.A. a lot,
because somebody lied to them and told them that they had to go to A.A. meetings
all of the time or else they would relapse.

<p>
<li>
Likewise, Moos glossed over spontaneous remission in this sentence:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Overall, 65% of those who initially took part in both treatment and AA
were free of alcohol problems at 16 years, compared to 57% of those who
took part only in AA, and 50% of those who received treatment alone.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Where's the control group? Where is the information on the people who got no
treatment?
<p>
Look at the table of numbers for a spontaneous remission rate of 5% per year,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#exponential" target="newwin61">here</a>. (And look at the reasons
to peg the spontaneous remission rate at 5% per year
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg" target="newwin62">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ftnt06" target="newwin63">here</a>.)

Those numbers reveal that, at the 16-year point,
56% of the alcoholics will have quit anyway, without
any &quot;treatment&quot; or A.A. meetings or anything else.
They just quit because they are sick and tired of being sick and tired.
And they quit alone, on their own.
<p>
The difference between the 57% A.A. success rate and the 56% spontaneous remission
rate is microscopic and meaningless, and may be nothing more than
round-off error.
So A.A. alone seems to be equal to doing nothing.
<p>
Still, just for the sake of argument, we can tentatively accept Moos's claim
that, after 16 years,
A.A. got a one percent success rate above normal spontaneous remission.
That sure isn't much to brag about.

<p>
Worse yet, the &quot;treatment program&quot; seems to have actually
reduced the success rate way below what we would expect from spontaneous
remission alone &#8212; down from 56% to 50%. The treatment programs were so
bad that they made people fail, and kept people from getting sober.
Treatment scores a negative 6% &#8212; way below zero.
<p>
<li>
Then, by some bizarre mathematics, Moos found that combining A.A. and treatment
<i>improved</i> the success rate way above the normal rate of
spontaneous remission, up to 65%, eight points above spontaneous remission.
That's like 1% (A.A.) added to a minus 6% (treatment) equals a
positive 8% (Moos's new combined success rate). Strange, very strange.
<center>
1 + (-6) = 8
</center>
Welcome to the wonderful world of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#bad_math" target="newwin64">new mathematics</a>.
<p>
<li>
As you pointed out, the difference between 57% and 65% is small, and can be
explained entirely in terms of the most motivated patients decided to both
quit drinking and &quot;work the program&quot;, just in case the program might be helpful.
Again, they were a self-selected group, and were the most highly-motived people.
<p>
Besides which, that 65% number may be totally wrong, or just a fabrication.
If Moos did not include all of the people who started the programs in calculating
the final results (which is nearly impossible, because of the drop-outs and
disappearances), then
Moos was just cherry-picking those people who stayed around and stayed
in the program, and using only them to calculate a grossly inflated
success rate.<br>
Again, [ 1 + (-6) = +8 ] is very suspicious.

<p>
<li>
Then Moos quietly makes the false assumption that Alcoholics Anonymous somehow
made the winners quit drinking. There is simply no evidence to support that conclusion.
None whatsoever. The A.A. score was equal to the rate of spontaneous remission,
which makes the effective A.A. success rate zero.
A.A. did not increase the rate of sobriety at all. It was a complete and total
failure.
Nevertheless, not one to allow
his faith to be shaken by mere facts, Moos enthusiastically declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;The findings suggest that counselors in information and referral
centers, as well as clinicians in substance-abuse treatment settings,
should make every reasonable effort to enable people with alcohol-related
problems to enter and continue to take part in self-help groups such as
AA,&quot; said Moos.
<p>
According to Moos, a big part of the challenge in treating alcohol
addiction is keeping patients in 12-step self-help programs such as AA.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No wonder treatment is a failure.

<p>
<li>
And then Moos's headline used the propaganda technique of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="newwin65">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;:<br>
<center>
<b>Treatment plus Alcoholics Anonymous may work best for those with drinking problems</b>
</center>
<p>
<i>Yeh, and then again,
<font color="#9F0000"><i>it may</i></font>
be totally useless and a waste of time and money.</i>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>It may</i></font> even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin66">increase the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin67">raise the death rate</a>.
</ol>
<p>
I don't know how Stanford University and the Veteran's Administration
can allow Moos and Humphreys to continue using their facilities to
foist this hoax on the public. This sure isn't science or medicine.
<p>
Well, actually, I can understand how the V.A. allows it. They have really
degenerated.
Just yesterday, I was talking to a friend who went to a treatment program
at the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System in Palo Alto, California.
He said that they gave him a choice of Bible Study or Alcoholics Anonymous, or
get kicked out of the program and tossed out onto the streets.
Gee, that's quite a treatment program &#8212; fundamentalist Christianity or
heretical Buchmanism or homelessness.
<p>
Somehow, I'm not sure that is a scientific and medically valid
treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction.
<p>
And isn't that kind of treatment
<a href="orange-action.html" target="newwin68">just what the veterans deserve</a>
as their reward
for having put their lives on the line for our country?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

UPDATE: 2011.07.11:<br>
The <i>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i> also analyzed the so-called &quot;test&quot; of A.A.
versus CBT at the Palo-Alto Veterans' Center, and they
 found that the Humpheys-Moos study was invalid, erroneous, badly done, and downright deceptive
and faked. They concluded that A.A. did more harm than good, and responsible health care professionals
should not refer clients to A.A.
