<b>&quot;No Meds&quot;</b> Horror Stories</font><br>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous have a long history of killing people by
telling them not to take their doctor-prescribed medications, and not to see a doctor.
Faithful Steppers argue that God can cure all ills,
or that the 12 Steps should cure the patient, and that taking
medications is just &quot;substituting one drug for another&quot;,
and that people who take medicine
for their illnesses are not &quot;really sober&quot;.
<p>
A.A. and the other 12-Step organizations, especially Al-Anon, jabber slogans like,
<ul>
<li> &quot;Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
<li> &quot;You won't have 'real sobriety' if you take medications.&quot;</a>
<li> &quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#God_anything" target="_blank">God can do anything</a>.
You don't need medications.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you take medications to treat an addiction,
<a href="orange-big_lie.html#substituting" target="_blank">you are just substituting one drug for another</a>.&quot;
<li> &quot;Medications just treat the surface symptoms. The Twelve Steps will get
at the underlying causes.&quot;
<li> &quot;Doctors who prescribe drugs don't know anything about
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">using spirituality to cure spiritual diseases</a>.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no chemical solution to a spiritual problem.&quot;
<li>
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#substituting" target="_blank">
 &quot;A word of caution: The use of other mood-altering medications, like
tranquilizers, can be very dangerous to a recovering addict and only
a band-aid on the real problem for a non-addict.&quot;</a>

</ul>

<p>
We have discussed and debated the &quot;no medications&quot; issue so many times that it is getting to
be incredible.
Here is the list of &quot;no meds&quot; 12-Step horror stories that I have received:

<p>
<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters22.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I myself, have heard more than a handful of
stories of people I KNEW in AA over the last 17 years, who, on the
advice of their sponsor, stopped taking medication and as a result
committed suicide because their depression was untreated. A.A.er's
hardly blink at this: they claim the person simply was not working
the steps right.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters33.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...the members informed me that, &quot;unlike most AA groups&quot;, they adhere to a &quot;no-pill policy&quot;.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters36.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I have seen some of the abuses that happens in AA with 13th stepping,
sponsors telling the newbie's to quit taking medications, and the like.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters43.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
He still has problems with his health, with depression, terrible anger
problems, and he gets only AA help, which encourages him to get off his
anti-depressants because they are drugs.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters44.html#suicide" target="_blank">
One guy here in London is so out of control (the cult master) that he
&quot;suggested&quot; one of his sponsees stop taking his perscribed medication.
Two weeks later said sponsee had comitted suicide by jumping off a
motorway bridge.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters49.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I'm bi-polar and went off my meds (because of aa
guilt) and ended up in a mental hospital because i was going to kill
myself</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters8.html#psych" target="_blank">
He also got rather defensive/offended when I hinted that my
psychiatrist was helping me with my bi-polar. I was getting counselling
with the mental health department one night a week and seeing the doc
every two weeks. When I mentioned to him that I was being helped, he
said &quot;but it's not a meeting.&quot; As though that settles it.  Damn right
it wasn't a meeting. It was therapy which I seriously needed.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters57.html#millions" target="_blank">He points out that millions of addicts around the world have recovered without the help of medication.</a>

<p><li>
Carolyn See was the step-daughter of Wynn (Corum) See,
who was the authoress of the <i>Big Book</i> story &quot;Freedom From Bondage&quot;</i>,
and another one of Bill Wilson's paramours.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Carolyn_See">
Carolyn reported that during her childhood she heard the early A.A. members arguing about
whether taking aspirin for a headache constituted a slip from sobriety</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">The Hazelden Coffee War</a> is the
funny story of anti-medication fanatics at the Hazelden &quot;treatment center&quot;
who thought that coffee was too strong of a drug to allow to people in recovery.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#no_meds" target="_blank">Quacks who are selling 12-Step
&quot;recovery&quot; &#8212; even to non-alcoholics and non-addicts &#8212;
routinely tell people not to take medications</a>.


<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds_suicide" target="_blank">
A mental patient commits suicide after his sponsor deprives him of his medications.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters99.html#nomeds" target="_blank">
Last week, one AA guy I barely know pulled me aside and started asking me about the
medications I was on. ... I humored him, and told him honestly that I was on Prozac. He then
proceeded to talk about the &quot;evils&quot; of antidepressant medicine, and that I needed to
find a way to get off them.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters102.html#nomeds" target="_blank">
I decided to leave when he began implying that I should quit taking my zoloft.
When I told him I didn't think that my taking a non-narcotic medication
as prescribed by a mental health counselor was his business, he came
back with &quot;See, I touched a nerve, there must be something there&quot;.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters100.html#nomeds" target="_blank">
Your therapist prescribes care-taking medication.  Your sponsor prescribes
prayer making and meditation.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters100.html#Bainbridge" target="_blank">The Bainbridge Island, Washington,
A.A. group is another sex society</a>. And also, &quot;When I was in detox in Everett I was kicked out with a bad case of D.T.'s because I brought up the topic of prescriptions in group.&quot;

<p><li>
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds_suicide2" target="_blank">
Another mental patient commits suicide after the A.A. old-timers talk him into not taking his medications.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters106.html#nomeds" target="_blank">
[In the Midtown Group] She says she was pressured to stop taking the
medication a doctor had prescribed to manage her bipolar disorder:
group members told her she couldn't be sober if she was taking any
kind of drug.

== A 15-year-old girl is told to cut off all communications with people outside of A.A.,
and stop taking medications for a bipolar disorder, and is encouraged
to have sex with <i>MUCH</i> older A.A. men.</a>

<p><li>
There is a long discussion of the &quot;no meds&quot; issue in this letter, including a list of
previous stories:<br>
<a href="orange-letters127.html#no_meds_list" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters127.html#no_meds_list</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters113.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
An official A.A. pamphlet admits that A.A. sponsors telling people not to take medications
has resulted in suicides.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters139.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I finally went to a shrink, and he wanted to
put me on medication. I told my &quot;friend&quot; this, and he took me out to eat after a
meeting, with four other people, and they did an intervention. &quot;We'd really hate to
see you get drunk. You shouldn't take medicine, you won't be sober anymore, and
you'll drink very soon.&quot;</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters147.html#medications" target="_blank">
At about the same time I was diagnosed
with Bipolar Disorder by a competent psychiatrist and I was treated
with the drugs available at that time, lithium and antidepressants.
As I was being treated for my bipolar disorder I mentioned this in
meetings and although I naively did not understand it at the time, I
was chastised and told to not take those medications, God would heal
me.</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters149.html#horror" target="_blank">It is insane to tell someone like my sister who was bi-polar and suffering from so much, that she should ... Stop taking all medications</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters158.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
Rather than going on meds, this guy killed himself...</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters162.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
My appointed sponsor insists that I
discontinue all of my medications (including those used for depression), or
otherwise I would not be considered &quot;sober.&quot;  I have one year of sobriety, and my
sponsor insists that I have zero, because every day I am &quot;relapsing.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters175.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
She also told me &quot;lots&quot; of people kill themselves after 20 years or so, it
is the hump thing. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; She also told me about her
group, where they kicked out a guy because he was on Anti depressants.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters184.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
The big one was that he told me I should get off the meds</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters200.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...my [A.A.] brother urged me to stop taking it.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters209.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
A.A. admits to anti-medication stance and suicide</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters212.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
She starts screaming at me because she knew I took medication for some
mental illnesses I have.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters216.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...I have to stop taking the meds and &quot;hiding&quot; behind my depression</a>...


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters219.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
The crap these people taught about medication was reprehensible. I stopped
taking medication after MY sponsor called me out on my Prozac.... I was
shamed into stopping it. I was informed by her, and several other pseudo-aa
doctors, that I would never get the &quot;message&quot; if my mind was clouded with
anti-depressants. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; I watched people die because of the anti-med
propaganda being thrown at people like Sarah and myself.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters221.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I was encouraged to bin my meds by NA members chanting the sacred mantra &quot;we are
allergic to all mind and mood altering substances&quot;.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters236.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I got off my meds so no one would say I wasn't &quot;working a program.&quot;</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters237.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
The medication issue in AA has grown very serious over the past  35 years.
When an AA sponsor encourages their pigeon to stop taking their  meds you
have a big problem. I was told the AA message would not get through the  fog
created by anti-depressants.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters240.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...the speaker at a meeting I was attending said to *not
listen to people who tell you to go off your meds*, and that she had
recieved *much help from taking anti-depressants prescribed for her
depression.*</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters241.html#horror" target="_blank">
After I gave birth I had severe postpartum depression. I had not
healed from the birth and my sponsor told me not to take any medication.
...
My sponsor had said that god would heal me and when god wanted me
to sleep I would.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters249.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...my &quot;homegroup&quot; meeting was so
against medications that this guy would announce every week that those people on a
certain medication should leave. At another meeting close by, I witnessed a newcomer shivering as he detoxed off an SSRI due to a sponsor's commandment. I witnessed this type of behavior and rhetoric at ALL of the regular AA meetings I attended.</a>


<p><li>
This story is an unusual reversal: The sponsor felt entitled to play doctor and prescribe medications:
<a href="orange-letters272.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
&quot;My sponsor told me to take the xanax daily everytime
I felt uncomfortable &nbsp; ... &nbsp; I followed his instructions and almost died or went
permanently insane.&quot;</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters273.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
They are going into treatment facilities and telling patients not to take
their doctor-prescribed medications.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters279.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...it was definitely not acceptible &#8212; my sponsor did pressure me to pressure
one of my sponsees not to start some medications</a>



<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters279.html#no_meds2" target="_blank">
I don't know what meetings you have
observed, but the meetings we took note of pushed attendeding college,
taking prescribed medications, and sure as hell never mentioned Jesus.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters280.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
I was advised by my first &quot;grand sponsor&quot;, not my actual sponsor
to go off my meds for bipolar 1 disorder, but I didn't.</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters282.html#horror" target="_blank">
Several years ago I sought the help of a Psychiatrist who happened to be in AA. I gave him
my complete trust. His prescription for depression was going to meetings rather than
&quot;feeling sorry for myself&quot; and &quot;carrying the AA message&quot;.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters284.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
And to think I had two different people try to get me off my meds</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters285.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
However I have recently been made aware that it has become the practice in some
meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous to advise persons to stop taking prescribed
medication for mental health problems.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters290.html#Susan2" target="_blank">
I have also never heard of anyone actually telling another not to
take prescribed medications.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters295.html#Ray_S" target="_blank">
A comment on Susan's &quot;no meds&quot; claim</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters302.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
Sober almost 17 years, without taking meds that keep me in bondage and
render me another statistic</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters369.html#Matt" target="_blank">
He told me that in order to get sober, I had to get off anti-depressants: they were dope.
Against my doctor, I tapered off. I wound up psychotic and catatonic in a
psych ward where they put me back on meds.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters386.html#No_Name" target="_blank">
I am disliked by some for refusing to stop taking
my Paxil and there are some who tune me out and or cough loudly when I share and I
am almost never called on to share.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters386.html#Jay_J" target="_blank">
I'm just not convinced that a majority of the people taking those medications
wouldn't have been better off to have never started and that the problem
with stopping is just one more good reason never to start.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters391.html#Squishy_Wish" target="_blank">
The first thing the councilors said was that he needed to change his meds from Welbutrin to Cipralex. When I told him he should only take medical advice from a qualified person they told me I could not talk to him anymore.</a>


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters396.html#no_meds" target="_blank">
...her sponsor had told her to quit anti-depressants...</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters420.html#John_H" target="_blank">
I was prescribed suboxone...  Because of this I would kinda get cornered and asked
when I was gonna &quot;get off that shit&quot; and that &quot;I wasn't really
clean&quot;.</a>
