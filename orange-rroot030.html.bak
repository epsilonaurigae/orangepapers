Every Alcoholics Anonymous meeting begins with several people
reading several standard texts, the
articles of faith of the group. One of these articles of faith
is of course the Twelve Steps. They
are prefaced by a statement like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;This is how we achieved
sobriety, and if you want what we have, and are ready to go to
any length to get it, then you are ready to take certain steps.&quot;
</font>
(Meaning: You are ready to do Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our stories disclose in a general way what we used to be like,
what happened, and what we are like now. If you have decided you
want what we have and are willing to go to any length to get it &#8212;
then you are ready to take certain steps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier,
softer way. But we could not. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Half measures availed us nothing. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:<br>

</blockquote>

Those statements imply that the original members of A.A. looked long
and hard for something, anything, that would work to save alcoholics
from self-destruction, anything to break the cycle of addiction
[quit, relapse, quit, relapse, quit, relapse],
and that the Twelve Steps were what finally worked for those
pioneering alcoholics.
<p>
Nothing could be further from the truth.

The truth is that a newly-sober alcoholic named
William Griffith Wilson &#8212;
a down-on-his-luck former Wall Street hustler
who put on airs of having once been a prosperous
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#stock_broker">stock broker</a>
&#8212; just sat down, in December of 1938, and
wrote up twelve commandments for the new religious group that he
and fellow alcoholics Doctor Robert Smith and Clarence Snyder had started.
Those commandments were simply a repackaged version of the practices
of another cult religion that was popular at that
time, something called &quot;The Oxford Group&quot;, or &quot;The
Oxford Group Movement&quot;, and later, &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; &#8212;
a religious cult that was created by a deceitful fascist
renegade Lutheran minister named Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman &#8212; a
dogmatic fanatic who
actually
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#praise_Hitler" target="_blank">thanked Heaven for giving us Adolf Hitler</a>,
and
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#great_lad" target="_blank">praised Heinrich Himmler as &quot;a great lad&quot;</a>.
<p>

Bill Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith, and Clarence Snyder had all been enthusiastic, true-believer
members of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult religion, but
the other Group members asked Bill to leave, and to take his shabby alcoholics with him,
because Bill was spending too much time with
his alcoholics, and not enough time following the dictates of the
cult leader, Frank Buchman.
Even worse, from the Oxford Group's point of view,
Bill Wilson was establishing himself as the leader of a sub-cult, the &quot;Alcoholic Squadron
of the Oxford Group&quot;,
thus competing directly with Frank Buchman for leadership of the cult, which is one
of the ultimate crimes in any cult.
(<i>&quot;Thou shalt have no other leader before me, for thy Leader is a jealous leader, and wants
all of your loyalty.&quot;</i>)

<p>
Still, Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob Smith, and Clarence Snyder
believed in the religious tenets of Buchmanism so much that they just formed
their own independent religious group, with exactly the same beliefs
as before. In fact, it was the same group; Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Clarence_Snyder" target="newwin137">Clarence Snyder
simply split off</a>
and hijacked and took over the alcoholics' branch of Frank Buchman's cult.

<p>
Bill Wilson had previously been ambushed by his old friend and
drinking buddy Ebby Thacher at a very vulnerable moment, in December of 1934, when he
was sick and detoxing from alcohol in a hospital, and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience">tripping his brains out on <i>delirium tremens</i> and hallucinogenic drugs</a>.
Under those conditions, Ebby succeeded in converting Bill into a
believer in Frank Buchman's cult. The conversion worked so well that
Wilson continued to believe in Buchmanism even after he was kicked
out of it.


<p>
<a name="OG_practices"> </a>
The practices of the Oxford Group were:
<ul>
<li> 1) Admission of personal defeat (You have been defeated by sin).<br>
<li> 2) Taking of personal inventory. (List your sins.)<br>
<li> 3) Confession of one's sins to another person.<br>
<li> 4) Making restitution to those one has harmed.<br>
<li> 5) Helping others selflessly.<br>
<li> 6) Praying to God for Guidance and the power to put these precepts into practice.<br>
</ul>
<p>
There was also one more very important requirement, one that is apparently
not listed in these
six practices, <i>&quot;Go recruit more members for the Group.&quot;</i>
Actually, many Oxford Group believers would say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It is so listed. It's Practice Five. Converting people to the
<i>right</i> religious beliefs and 'principles', so that they can
get into Heaven too, is definitely helping them. So working all day long to
get new converts for the Group is 'helping others selflessly.'&quot;</font>
In fact, because the Oxford Groups and Moral Re-Armament had an official policy of
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#no_charity"><i>never, ever</i> dispensing charity to anybody</a>,
recruiting more people into the cult was the <i>only</i> way that the Buchmanites
<i>ever</i> &quot;helped others selflessly&quot;.

<a name="six_steps"> </a>
Those were also, essentially, the original six steps of Alcoholics
Anonymous, years before the group even had that name &#8212; back when it
was just &quot;The Alcoholic Squadron&quot;
of The Oxford Group. Some of the very early A.A. members mention the
original six steps in the &quot;Big Book&quot;, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>.
These steps are listed in the historical autobiographical story
<i>He Sold Himself Short</i>
<font size="-1">
(on page 292 of the 3rd edition the <i>Big Book</i>, and
page 263 of the 4th edition)</font>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li> 1. Complete deflation.
<li> 2. Dependence and guidance from a Higher Power.
<li> 3. Moral inventory.
<li> 4. Confession.
<li> 5. Restitution.
<li> 6. Continued work with other alcoholics.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="Bill_guided"> </a>
In December, 1938, while writing the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson
simply rewrote the list of Buchmanite practices, very verbosely,
adding enough words to change the six or seven &quot;principles&quot;
into twelve. Bill's wife, Lois, allegedly described the process this
way: (I say 'allegedly' because the book was probably ghost-written
for her by the A.A. faithful. Lois supposedly wrote that book when
she was very old and infirm and close to death, so it is hard to say
what part of the book is her memories, and what parts their wishful
thinking and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#old_meetings">parroting of
the standard party line</a>.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By this time Bill was ready to start the fifth chapter,
&quot;How It Works.&quot; He was not feeling well, but
the writing
had to go on, so he took pad and pencil to bed with
him. How could he bring the program alive so that
those at a distance, reading the book, could apply it to
themselves and perhaps get well? He had to be very
explicit. The six Oxford Group principles that the
Fellowship had been using were not definite enough.
He must broaden and deepen their implications. He
relaxed and <a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">asked for guidance</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he finished writing and reread what he had
put down, he was quite pleased. Twelve principles had
developed &#8212; the Twelve Steps.<br>

<a name="concrete_terms"> </a>
<p>
Bill Wilson also described the writing of the Twelve Steps this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this
book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a
six-step program then.<br>
...<br>
The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of concrete principles
that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out
of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps which people
wiggled out of.<br>

<font color="#9F0000">[Dead Link]</font>

</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<ul>
<li>
Notice how Bill Wilson considered his fellow alcoholics to be
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">a bunch of cheaters</a> who
will &quot;wiggle out of this deal&quot; if they can get away
with it &#8212; which Bill won't allow.

And note how Bill Wilson made himself the leader who was
<a href="orange-secrets.html#recovery_counselor">entitled to dictate
the concrete terms of other people's recovery programs</a>.
<li>
Also notice how Bill Wilson considered 'spiritual development'
to be a business deal, with a contract that you can't wiggle out of,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil">something like selling your soul to the Devil in trade

<p>
And Bill also wrote:
<p>

<center><table width="77%" border="5" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Note that Bill Wilson was being deceptive there when he listed
<a href="orange-rroot450.html" target="_blank">Sam Shoemaker</a>
as the American leader of the Oxford Groups. Sam Shoemaker was the Number Two man,
Frank Buchman was the leader. But Bill Wilson didn't want to mention
Dr. Frank Buchman, because Buchman had a terrible reputation for
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">his praise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis</a>,
and
<a href="orange-rroot420.html" target="_blank">aiding and abetting draft-dodging schemes</a>.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
<a name="knees"> </a>
So Bill Wilson took the various practices and procedures of Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups
and turned them into a 12-Step program for Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li> 1. [We] Admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212; that our lives had
become unmanageable.

<li> 2. Came to believe that God could restore us to sanity.

<li> 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care and direction of God.

<li> 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

<li> 5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.

<li> 6. Were entirely willing that God remove all these defects of character.

<li> 7. Humbly, on our knees, asked Him to remove our shortcomings &#8212; holding nothing back.

<li> 8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing
to make complete amends to them all.

<li> 9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except
when to do so would injure them or others.

<li> 10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong
promptly admitted it.

<li> 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our contact
with God, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power
to carry that out.

<li> 12. <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience">Having had a
spiritual experience</a> as the result of this course of action,
we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics,
and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="#9F0000">
The wording at the end of Step 12 is deceptive and inaccurate: the 12
Steps are <i>cult practices</i>, not &quot;spiritual principles&quot;.
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#no_principles">There are no actual spiritual principles there</a>
for you &quot;to practice in all of your affairs&quot;.
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
<a name="changes"> </a>
Then Bill presented his Twelve Steps to the other early A.A. members,
who promptly freaked out and screamed bloody murder.
They clearly foresaw that Bill's dogmatic religiosity was
going to drive away many of the very alcoholics whom the program
was supposed to help. A loud shouting match ensued, and Bill was
forced to compromise.
<p>
So Bill Wilson toned down the language somewhat: The word
&quot;God&quot; in Step 2 was replaced
with &quot;a Power greater than ourselves&quot;. The phrase
&quot;as we understood Him&quot; was added after the
word &quot;God&quot; in Step 3 (and later in Step 11).
In Step 7, the <i>&quot;on
our knees&quot;</i> phrase was deleted from
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Humbly, on our knees, asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;
</font>
<p>
But the rest of the steps were left pretty
much unchanged, except for this one giant concession: In the <i>Big Book</i>,
the Twelve Steps were preceded by a statement saying that they were only
&quot;suggested as a program of recovery.&quot;
(The true believers laugh, and say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Yeh, it's only a suggestion. But you will die if you don't follow the suggestion.&quot;)
</font>
<p>
<center><table width="89%" border="3" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

That partial editing produced a funny progression: <br>
<ul>
<li> In Step 2, we only have to believe in a
nice, vague, &quot;Power greater than ourselves.&quot;
<li> But then they pull a quick
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater">bait-and-switch</a>
stunt on us, and in Step 3, it's suddenly &quot;God&quot;, a
define-it-yourself &quot;God, as we understood Him&quot;, they say, into
whose care we must give our wills and our lives. But even that is deceptive double-talk:
We aren't really free to
define 'God' for ourselves &#8212; It has to be some version of 'God' capable of
taking control of our wills and our lives, and able and willing to 'take care of'
our lives for us, and also a God stupid enough to waste his time doing so...

<li> And then, in Steps 5 and 6, it's just plain old &quot;God&quot;,
with no qualifiers at all.
<li> Then we are told that it's a God that we should confess to, and
pray to... And we should beg &quot;Him&quot; to give us the goodies.
<li> And then we are told what to pray for &#8212; removal of our
&quot;defects of character&quot; and our &quot;shortcomings&quot;, and
&quot;knowledge of His will and the power to carry it out.&quot;
<li> So we are supposed to spend the rest of our lives confessing our
sins and &quot;seeking and doing the Will of God&quot; by following the
orders that we think we hear in our heads during meditation sessions
and s&eacute;ances.
</ul>
<p>
<a href="orange-spirrel.html">That's a religion</a>, not a quit-drinking program.

<p>
These are the Steps that came out of that process (as printed in
the original 1939 multilith edition):
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Nowhere in the Twelve Steps does it say that you should actually quit
drinking, or help anyone else to quit drinking, either.
Nowhere in the Twelve Steps do the words &quot;sobriety&quot;,
&quot;recovery&quot;, &quot;abstinence&quot;,
&quot;health&quot;,
&quot;happiness&quot;,
&quot;joy&quot;,

The word &quot;alcohol&quot; was only mentioned once, where it was patched into the

instead of the Oxford Group slogan,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;we are powerless over sin and have been defeated by it&quot;</i></font>.<br>
And then the phrase &quot;especially alcoholics&quot; was patched into the 12th step
as the target for further recruiting efforts:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;...we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics&quot;</i>...</font><br>

The Twelve Steps are not a formula for curing or treating alcoholism,
and they never were.

The Twelve Steps are not &quot;spiritual principles&quot; and they never were.<br>
The Twelve Steps are <i>cult practices</i> that work to convert people
into confirmed true believers in a proselytizing cult religion, just like Frank Buchman's
so-called &quot;spiritual principles&quot; did.
<p>
The commandment in Step 12, which is repeated in Tradition 5, was to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;carry this message to others, especially alcoholics&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Carry what message?
<p>
The message that William G. Wilson's version of Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman's
religion is the answer to alcoholism &#8212; the message that
enthusiastic obsession with Frank Buchman's superstitious occult practices will
save people from alcoholism.

Bill Wilson believed that <i>&quot;the only radical remedy ... for
dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;</i> Meaning:
the only cure for alcoholism is religious fanaticism &#8212; religious mania.
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">That suggestion allegedly came from Carl Jung</a>,
the famous Swiss psychiatrist, and when Carl Jung said &quot;mania&quot;,
he really did mean &quot;mania&quot;, as in &quot;maniac&quot;.<br>

Note that both William H. White, in <i>Slaying The Dragon</i>, page 77,
and Bill Pitmann, in <i>AA: The Way It Began</i>, page 171,
attribute that dipsomania quote to
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Varieties_quote">William James in
<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i></a>, (page 263), not to
Carl Jung. For good reason &#8212; footnote 1 on page 263
of <i>Varieties</i> says:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
'&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot;
is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical man.'</font>
<p>
William James published <i>Varieties</i> in 1902, but he didn't meet Carl Jung
until 1909, so it is unlikely that James got that line from Jung.
<p>
Furthermore, nowhere in the writings of Carl Jung is there anything like the statement that
&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;
Quite the opposite.
<a href="orange-Jung.html" target="_blank">
The one story in the collected works of Carl Jung</a>
that described him treating an alcoholic patient explained how Jung
cured the patient by separating him from his domineering mother.

<!--
And the story is that Rowland Hazard didn't see Carl Jung until 1931,
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">if he was ever treated by Jung at all</a>.
-->

<p>
Bill Wilson often repeated the story of how either Ebby Thacher or Rowland Hazard
(he couldn't remember which it was)
brought him James' <i>Varieties</i> to read while he was detoxing in
the hospital, in December of 1934,
the day after he had his &quot;vision of God&quot; while tripping on
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">the hallucinogenc drug belladonna</a>.
Wilson probably read that line about dipsomania and religiomania there
and then may have forgotten where he saw it.
<p>
In that case, Carl Jung did not contribute <i>anything</i> to the
Alcoholics Anonymous dogma. Most all of the A.A. doctrines and practices came from Frank Buchman and the
Oxford Group, with just a few odds and ends copied from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#temperance_unions">earlier
temperance unions and sobriety movements</a>.

<a name="Rowland_Jung"> </a>
According to the standard
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">A.A. version of the story</a>, a
rich American with a drinking problem, Rowland Hazard, had gone to
Carl Jung, in Switzerland, for treatment.
He had relapsed in spite of Jung's best treatment.
Jung apologized, and said that he felt sure now that Rowland was one
of the hopeless alcoholics, one for whom there was no cure.
When Rowland asked Jung if there was any sure way for an alcoholic to
recover &#8212; truly recover, Jung is quoted as saying,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Yes, there is. Exceptions to cases such as yours have been occurring
since early times. Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had
what are called vital spiritual experiences. To me these are phenomena.
They appear to be in the nature of huge emotional displacements and
rearrangements. Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding
forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, and a
completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them.
In fact, I have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement
within you. With many individuals the methods which I employed are successful,
but I have never been successful with an alcoholic of your description.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It seems that Jung's pronouncement that the only hope for Rowland
was a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; was the final stage of Rowland's
treatment.
Rowland felt that such an experience was impossible. He felt so hopeless that
he was &quot;deflated&quot; to the point of &quot;giving up.&quot;
As a result, he had the &quot;rearrangement&quot;, and became an enthusiastic new
convert to Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Groups&quot; religion.

Some critics
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">discount this story</a> as a
complete fabrication. It was Dr. William D. Silkworth who taught
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#Silkworth_fear_induction">the strategy of
scaring alcoholics with threats of death and
declarations of hopelessness</a>, not Carl Jung.
<!---------
Critics say that Rowland Hazard was not treated by Carl Jung &#8212; that he was
working in places like New Mexico when he was supposedly in Switzerland with
Carl Jung.

Rowland Hazard allegedly later explained
it to Ebby Thacher, who in turn explained it to William Wilson, who
explained it to Dr. Robert Smith. Then Bill and Dr. Bob assembled a
religious group of alcoholics, inside of the Oxford Group cult,
that years later became Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
So the Twelve Steps really were, right from the very start,
intended to
<ul>
<li> start a new religion &#8212; Bill Wilson's flavor of Buchmanism,
<li> and to give the followers
&quot;vital spiritual experiences&quot; and &quot;huge emotional
rearrangements&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#religious_experience">religious experiences</a>&quot;
by &quot;completely deflating their egos&quot;,
<li> and to turn the followers into religious fanatics &#8212;
<i>&quot;religiomaniacs&quot;</i>.
</ul>
<p>
Bill Wilson believed that religious fanaticism &#8212; <i>religiomania</i> &#8212;
was <i><b>The Only Answer</b></i> for alcoholics, and he said so often.

<p>
And note that Bill Wilson also wanted to convert non-alcoholics to his
new religion,
too.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt022">22</a></sup></font>
Alcoholics Anonymous isn't just about quitting drinking. The original wording of
Step Twelve commanded A.A. members to
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;carry this message to others, especially alcoholics.&quot;</i>
</font>
So non-alcoholic &quot;others&quot; were also fair game for
being recruited into Bill Wilson's &quot;spiritual fellowship&quot;.
They go into other branches of the 12-Step religion like
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html"><i>Al-Anon</i> &#8212; the wives' and families'
auxiliary, Alateen &#8212; the teenagers' groups, and <i>ACOA</i> &#8212;
&quot;Adult Children Of Alcoholics&quot;</a>.)

<p>
Oh, by the way, the &quot;mental rearrangement&quot; and <i>religiomania</i>
and cult religion routine didn't work for either Rowland Hazard or Ebby Thacher.
Both eventually quit the Oxford Group and went back to drinking, and drank
for pretty much the rest of their lives.
(<a href="orange-letters10.html#Ebby" target="newwin65">Bill Wilson kept Ebby Thacher housed at
a detox farm in upstate New York for the last two years of his life</a>, where he was
not allowed to drink. But otherwise, when he was on his own, he drank.
Likewise, Rowland Hazard drank on and off for the rest of his life.)
