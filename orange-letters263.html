From:  	&quot;pete h.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	minors expoited by steppers-<br>

<p>
for some reason the letter got returned. I would like this version as
opposed to the fb one. trying again-

<p>
Before I begin I wish to make my plug again with everyone else that you put
this info into a book. If not for the fame and fortune we all think that you
deserve, than for the posterity of future generations who may be deprived of
internet access, have their web searching monitored or censored, or even
just plain run out of power for computers. Steppism  wrecks such tremendous
havoc in peoples' lives, is such a rabid threat to life and liberty, that
therefore steppism will continue to pustulate  if such info is unavailable.

<p>
A tiger in my opinion  does not change its stripes;  I feel it  incumbent to
advance this info as the perpetrators are still in meetings halls, and young
peoples are habitually sentenced to such backwaters. Some below are now
police officers and work in treatment centers. As I write this I feel it is
important to note that I have no interest in being the sex police, and
whether we lower the age of consent is an entirely different matter. I have
contacted all perpetrators I shall discuss for comment, and have yet to
receive a response though given ample time.
<p>
Also, from my earliest days in
Ryther child center to the present in my tenure at AA, I have witnessed the
crime of freely dispensing cigarettes with impunity to minors  in AA
meetings and adolescent treatment centers &#8212; the crime of contributing to the
delinquency of minors if not also adding to the healthcare burden &#8212; and this
crime is unenforced.
<p>
Such attitudes advanced by the fascist cult of AA have
done everything to encourage these examples of statutory rape and sexual
exploitation of minors that I have witnessed over the years.
In the Bainbridge group [Bainbridge Island, Washington State] of AA,
bleeding over into the neighboring Poulsbo,
group things really got out of hand.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
The first example &#8212; Tom Gow &#8212; had it put
to him bluntly: &quot;She is only 13 &#8212; that is 3 years away from 10 years old.&quot;
<p>
What is important to note about Tom, who was in his twenties I believe at
the time, is that now &#8212; or so it looks from his facebook page &#8212; he is a police
officer. I asked him if he has ever arrested or had someone convicted for
this crime, and have received no comment. I am not sure but he may have been
working for Sundown at the time, and did work for this treatment center
before he became a police officer.
<p>
<li>
The next case is one Ron Miguel Jr. He
had a relationship with a 16 year old that went on for two years in AA until
she went to college. He frankly admitted that they were having sex in
violation of the law.  Ron is important because his father is a big time
&quot;oldtimer&quot; in meetings, so Jr. was basically given a free hand. My opinion
is that this was the green light for other following instances &#8212; including
Gow's. His underage girl friend also had a friend who made the rounds in
meetings, I assume they were the same age, and was involved with members Tim
Tomspson and JT Knowlton &#8212; I am not sure of her age at the time.
<p>
<li>
Then there was Glen (last name unknown). Glen migrated from the east coast
to Bainbridge [Washington]
with 10 years of steppism behind him, which granted him instant cult status.
He began to spend all his time with a fourteen year old from an
underprivileged background. They would often show up late to meetings
together with their hair wet as if they just took a shower, and then could
be witnessed there displaying what public schools define as
&quot;PDA's&quot; &#8212; personal displays of affection &#8212; which are not allowed between
consenting minors in a public school setting. Every body gossiped about
this; nothing was done.
<p>
I finally confronted the two with the position that
 &#8212;  if it looks like a duck, acts like a duck &#8212; you know what. . .? and I was
told point blank this was none of my business. This claim seems so fitting
from a Nazi-inspired Oxford Group offshoot &#8212; Was that not the basic position
of the 3rd Reich regarding the Holocaust(?) &#8212;
 &quot;It was none of our business.&quot;
<p>
Like 911 truth, I have made it my business. Apparently, the excuse he
offered for the behavior was unless we all witnessed those two in bed
together, we have no proof. I will leave it up to the readers if they feel
it is appropriate for their 14 year old daughter to spend all her time with
a 26 year old Hall Rat.  I got better things to do than follow steppers
around sniffing the sheets. The upshot of all this is that they &quot;ran off&quot;
together, and I think we can all do the math.
<p>
<li>
The last example I wish to note is someone from the Poulsbo group whose
name I do not know. There was another 13 year old girl there who was dating
Ron's younger brother Lawrence &#8212; both minors; no crime there. This person in
his mid twenties became Lawrence's sponsor, stole his 13 year old girl
friend, and then made Lawerence do his fourth step.  JT Knowlton it should
also be noted was accused of date-raping another young female in that
group. He and Ron Jr. affiliated with a local Tribe, and convinced them to
send a cadre of their wayward youth in that time-honored, failsafe cure for
addiction and delinquency &#8212; a forced march through the wilderness. They
somehow persuaded this young female to participate as well, and six months
later she had still not been paid for her services, in addition to claiming
she was date-raped. These twisted wilderness expeditions have direct ties to
steppism, and let no one claim otherwise.
<p>
<li>
The last example I wish to note is Harold Shraeder of the Sedro &#8212; Wolly group.
He is said to have numerous affairs with underage girls in 12-step halls,
one of which produced a child. Harold is noteworthy in that he now whines in
AA meetings about having to pay child support for his actions, and the child
with its mother has grown up on the welfare rolls. Moreover, I have
witnessed Harold living illegally and fraudulently in public housing with
this child's mother &#8212; unable or incapable of housing himself. What are the
odds he listens to Rush Limbaugh and voted for president frat-boy?
</ol>

<p>
When adolescent treatment centers and the courts sentence minors to Steppism
this inevitable out come results. Nothing less can be expected from the Nazi
loving cult of a wall street huckster, and this has to stop and stop
immediately. Steppism is simply a menace to life, liberty, and the general
welfare of society. Nothing greater underscores this base hypocrisy than the
above examples.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Pete,
<p>
Thanks for the report from Bainbridge Island. I think it is important for the public
to hear what is really going on. And how much danger their children are in if they
get sent to 12-Step &quot;help&quot;.

Subject:  	Survivor Of Christ Covenant Cult says thanks and HELP??????<br>

<p>
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">This test</a>
hits every doubt or concern about the place I was born into and
lived for 26 years. Christ Covenant Anglican Catholic Church (formerly His
Community, etc. etc) has been going strong since 1969 and boasts over 200
members in Marshfield, Vt. With its own school, grocery store, and banking
system, it is highly self-sufficient. Nearly every point on the list hits
home. If you want a clear cut case of systematic abuse and absolute
shunning of x-members including family, along with the ability to deceive
some very intelligent people, this is your place.
<p>
After coming out it is incredible how I discover nearly every day ways
&quot;they&quot; are still effecting
my mind and the way I think. This place is begging for an investigation but
people around here are too scared to act. The closest we have ever come is
an article by Daniel Staples at the <i>Times Argus</i> a few weeks ago in the
Sunday paper. People across the country have been affected and want to be
heard. The place has shed many members over the years. Should you be in an
investigative mode this place will blow your mind. In any event, thanks for
the list. If my friends and family I left behind ever begin to question, I
plan to use it as a tool to help them see the light as it helped me.
<p>
Thanks again.<br>

Hello Ruth,

Subject:  	Just an over-lengthy thank you<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I have spent the last 5 days
absorbing as much as I can of the information on your pages.  I only wish that I had
seen it years
ago.  I have spent the last 10 years
sober and the 17 years prior to that not drinking (in actuality sober).  Prior to
that, I was a drinker who drank &quot;alcoholically&quot;
and was very probably an alcoholic.  I
really don't know? I do know that I was a mess.

<p>
In 1999, after my wife left,
I made a failed, half-serious suicide attempt and through what I now realize
was a huge not-so-funny comedy of errors, I entered a treatment facility, for
depression, which ONLY used 12 step treatment methods.  After an hour long
counseling and evaluation
session, it was determined that I was an alcoholic who had been maintaining a &quot;dry
drunk&quot; status for the last 17 years and that they were sure that their program
of AA would help me.  The truth of the
matter is more probably that I had pretty darn good insurance and they really
didn't want to suggest I go somewhere else; however they really didn't have
anything else to offer in the way of a diagnosis that would allow them to get
paid.  The next 17 days were filled with
3 meetings a day, the proverbially 3 hots and a cot and lots and lots of card
playing, some arts and crafts (mostly gluing the AA slogans onto plaques for
the local AA rooms in the area  &#8212;  apparently to thank them for bringing &quot;outreach&quot;
meetings to the facility) and waiting for the next smoke break.  The cost of this
program over and above my
insurance coverage would be about 1700 dollars, IF I didn't attend the expected and
suggested 90 in 90 meetings at a local AA room and returned with a
signed attendance card.  Otherwise, I was
good to go, or as they said, &quot;as fixed as we know how to get you.&quot; They chided to
me as I left &quot;Take it Easy&quot;,
&quot;Let go and let God&quot; and of course the ever popular
&quot;It Works If You Work It&quot;.


<p>
I fell right into the meeting
routine (3 a day for 90 days) and made a lot of friends; something that I hadn't
had in years.  I actually started feeling
better.   After 90 days, I chaired meetings and made
coffee and eventually became a trusted servant as the procurement and
purchasing member for the group.

<p>
I, however, like you, never
had a sponsor other than a guy who &quot;appointed himself&quot; to me and I never worked
the steps.  I also felt horrible that I
was lying through my teeth and telling people that I was doing all of the
things they wanted me to do in order to feel like a part of the group.  I actually
wanted to fit in so much, I picked
up the proverbially inevitable &quot;white chip&quot; after a couple of years because
everyone else who was actually &quot;working the program and the steps&quot; was
relapsing and getting lots of attention and well, I kind of thought that was
what &quot;real alcoholics&quot; (as if that is some sort of badge of honor) were
supposed to do.  And of course the
self-appointed sponsor gloated that
<ul>
<li>
a) It never would have happened if I hadn't fired him as my sponsor.
(Never really hired him although I DID in fact fired him)<br>
And
<li>
b) If I had waited a couple of more weeks he wouldn't have won the old-timers pool.<br>
And
<li>
c) I could now relax and &quot;get with the program&quot; because I already had
my brush with death and was blessed and lucky enough to survive. (Of course
I never really picked up that drink nor even thought about it)
</ul>

<p>
This room was no different
than any other club centered AA group which offers 30&#8212;35 meetings a week;
consisting of a small group of extremely
overbearing, outwardly &quot;jovial&quot; (to avoiding using the word happy) &#8212; inwardly
miserable  &#8212; 
old men who pounced on the male newcomers to do service work like sweeping and
cutting grass, and lusted after the newcomer females.

<p>
About 5 years after doing 2&#8212;3
meetings a day, and after watching a friend of mine die as the results of his
continually
relapsing on alcohol and crack and not getting the treatment that he needed because
his (yeah, you guessed it) sponsor (yeah you guessed it again one of those
tough old Billy goats who thinks that the steps will get you sober and service
work will keep you sober) really didn't think that he needed treatment (or
maybe it was that he needed his car washed that weekend); I decided that the
room that I attended was too sick to continue in, and basically stopped going
to AA.

<p>
I moved to another town for financial
reasons and have spent the last 5 years maintaining my sobriety by just not
drinking (which in fact actually &quot;does work if you work it&quot;).  I'm still trying to
kick those smokes and I'll get there soon.  For reasons really that
probably had a lot more to do with feeling a little out of the loop and not
meeting as many people that I thought I should have after the move, I recently
looked up and found the local rooms in the town where I now live.  I caught a few
meetings and met some very
nice people  &#8212;  as I expected I would.  The
people in the rooms are usually either &quot;nice and lonely hurting people&quot; or
proselytizing, Big Book thumping jerks that are also hurting.

 Reminds me of the James Thurber
fable, &quot;The Bear Who Let It Alone&quot;,<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320022337/http://4brightminds.info/thurber/bear_let_it_alone.jpg" target="_blank">
http://4brightminds.info/thurber/bear_let_it_alone.jpg</a>

<p>
I picked up my 10 year coin
and was invited to tell my story at the next speaker meeting (obviously, the
lonely folks probably wanted to get to know someone new and the jerks wanted to
buy me back into the &quot;program&quot; and take credit for something which they never
had a part in, either innocently or nefariously).  While doing this I actually did a
lot of
writing my experiences and being honest with myself and I wish I could tell you
I didn't tell &quot;my story&quot;, alas I did.  I
was almost hooked again  &#8212;  on the meetings, that is, not the sauce.  I went back into
an online chat-room (aaonline.org)
that I used to participate in and signed in one night only to find that a woman
telling the room that she wanted to kill herself.  Half of the people there were
telling her &quot;How
'chicken shit' that that solution is according to both the Big Book and the
Bible (not a verbatim quote)&quot; and the rest of them were letting her know that
it was her character defects and shortcomings that were responsible for her
feeling that way and of course, the inevitable, that it was her Disease talking
and this too shall pass.  Not one person
suggested or questioned whether she might be off of her meds, might need to
seriously find a doctor for a legitimate diagnosis, or anything else.  I posted to
the room that I felt like that
someone should have suggested that she should contact a suicide hotline or a
local mental health emergency number and was (yeah I'm sure you are way ahead
of me on this one too) told that that was an &quot;Outside Issue&quot; and not tolerated
in the room.  Of course that was after a
seven or eight second pause of complete silence (as in what the hell do we
write when someone asks that?) in the room.  I was floored by this.  Spouting
slogans and worthless acronyms was all they had???

<p>
I actually found your site
while trying to find an answer for this woman &quot;google-ing&quot; suicide and AA.  I went
back
to my home group the next day and when I mentioned the previous night's events to
one of my
friends there,  I was told, &quot;lots of 'us' die from this
disease&quot; and of course one of the proverbial &quot;old-timers&quot; was eavesdropping and
chimed in that those people did exactly what they were supposed to do because that
woman couldn't have been working the program very well if she wanted to kill
herself  &#8212;  they needed to stay away from her or else they might get drunk.
<p>
Of course, I had already heard and known what
would be the &quot;party&quot; line on that, but I couldn't help but worry that this
woman might have ended her life because, while she was seriously seeking help
of something that she had been told was supposed to be there for her, the &quot;hand
of AA&quot;, she was only given slogans, acronyms and misinformation.

<p>
Talk about your &quot;spiritual awakenings&quot;.  I think I finally
had one. (It's true that this is a life and death
disease/whatever-the-hell-category it goes into... and the amateurs are neither
trained nor capable of treating it.)

<p>
So, here I am now.  Feeling compelled to write to you.  Telling you where I am with
all of this.  Feeling partly responsible for the death of a
guy who had become my best friend and what may have been the death of a woman
who was just asking for help.  All that
was offered in either case was trite little cutesy slogans and asinine acronyms
and warnings of outside issues.

<p>
Actually I haven't been able
to quit reading this site  &#8212;  downloaded it and have it on my a flash drive so
that can take it with me to doctor appointments where they have no wi-fi  &#8212;  hell,
I even let my Farmville crops wither while reading your site.  Just kidding, I
actually harvested them on
time, (although, it would have made for a good story,) but it was close.

<p>
I know this is very lengthy
and I probably should have stopped hours ago, but I do need to add in here that
I honestly feel like the average &quot;rank and file&quot; AAer has no idea of how
insidious this cult is, talk about something that is cunning, baffling and
powerful.  Come to think of it you could probably substitute &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;
in a global search and replace for the word alcohol and the word yourself for
God and  have a pretty good statement.  Most of the AAers I have met are truly
interested in getting and staying sober and helping other people do the same; either
because they have been conned into believing it or they are just that lonely
and simply don't care because the fellowship puts them into contact with others
who, like themselves, are by default and admission, &quot;damaged goods&quot;.

<p>
What's the good news?  You've offered not only other options to AA (and
the other TSP's),
 but also gave a reasonable and very liberal list of &quot;good&quot;
things that AA has to offer.  I don't
know if I was an alcoholic and because I haven't had a drink in almost 27
years, I don't think I really need those other options, but you can bet I have

Please keep up the good

share this with

already know and have.

<p>
There should really be no reason
to post this on your site (and I don't really wish for it to be posted), as it
certainly is just one more of the same song you hear everyday that I am sure that
you receive from
every other person who writes  &#8212;   unless of
course, you feel as though it adds, somehow, to the conversation at hand.  If that
is the case please email me ahead of
time.  There a few people in the rooms who I now know
pay attention to your site that will recognize my story and I really don't want
to have to deal with them.  Please make
sure that my email address disappears as I have noticed is your regular and
responsible practice and sign me, simply, as,

Hello Neverdidthesteps,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments, and I'm glad that you like the geese too.

<p>
That is really an incredible story, and not your usual letter. Thanks for
your permission to print it.
<p>
About this line:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... don't know if I was an alcoholic and because I haven't had a drink in almost 27 years,...<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I don't know if you were &quot;an alcoholic&quot; either, but I don't think you are now.
You know, a lot of people drink too much when they are young. They &quot;party hearty&quot;. And
then they grow up and become responsible citizens and are boringly normal.
That is what you call &quot;being human&quot;.
<p>
And other people get really depressed when their marriage breaks up, and they drink too much
for a while.
That is also what you call &quot;being human&quot;.

<p>
What does A.A. even mean by &quot;an alcoholic&quot;, anyway? A.A. uses
three or four different definitions of &quot;alcoholic&quot;, and mixes
them up, which really confuses the issue.
<p>
We've been over this before, but I guess it's time to reprint the definitions again:
<p>
<a name="alcoholic_defs"> </a>
<a name="definitions"> </a>
<blockquote>
The definitions are:
<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol,
almost allergic to alcohol, perhaps a genetic alcoholic; someone who cannot drink
even one drink or his drinking will spin out of control and he will
become readdicted to alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is somebody who cannot quit drinking &#8212; he is
 &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">an insane sinner who is full of disgusting character defects</a>
and moral shortcomings and resentments and barely-contained anger,
and is a prime example of self-will run riot and
instincts run wild and selfishness and self-seeking and the Seven Deadly Sins,
although he doesn't think so...  etc., etc., ...
</ol>
<p>
When I call myself an alcoholic, I usually mean definition 2, and only occasionally
definition 1, but never definitions 3 or 4.
<p>
<ol>
<li> By definition 1, I stopped being an alcoholic more than 10 years ago.
<li> By definition 2, I will always be an alcoholic.
<li> By definition 3, I wasn't an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking, and I did.
I was not &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
I even quit drinking without any help from A.A., because I quit drinking two weeks before I
was ever <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">sent to an A.A. meeting</a>.

<li> By definition 4, I was never an alcoholic. I was always a nice drunk.
People liked having me at their parties because I was so much fun to have around
when I got high. (But, as one friend said, &quot;Even nice drunks die of
cirrhosis of the liver...&quot;)
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you pick which definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot; you prefer,
and you will get the yes or no answer to whether I am an alcoholic.
<p>
And I guess the same goes for you.
 
<p>
The story about the suicidal woman is really appalling, but I believe it.
It's just astounding, the depths to which people can sink when they
brainwash themselves into believing a bunch of crazy dogma.
Obviously, that is not a &quot;self-help&quot; group.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello again, Robin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You are demonstrating a very standard A.A. dodge to avoid
criticism.
<p>
First off, there is the
<a href="orange-propaganda#ad_hominem" target="_blank">
 minimization and denial</a>:
<font color="black">&quot;This is news to anybody.&quot;</font>
<p>
Actually, it is news to a lot of people. I recently received a letter from a woman
who decided to quit A.A. when she learned that A.A. was founded by a sexual predator.
Look here:
<a href="orange-letters258.html#Wendy_N" target="_blank">orange-letters258.html#Wendy_N</a>.

<p>
Then you tried the
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda#deflect" target="_blank">don't criticize others</a>&quot;
dodge. That is a favorite of criminals and con artists and cults.
They don't like to get criticized.

<p>
What you don't seem to realize is that Jesus had different ways of handling different
situations. When he was confronted with the adulteress whom the crowd wanted to
stone to death, He said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Let he who is without sin throw the first stone.&quot;</font>
<p>
The logic and morals are simple and obvious: She didn't deserve to be executed for
having made love with someone else. But Jesus didn't let her off totally: He told her
to go and sin no more.

<p>
On the other hand, when Jesus walked into the Temple and found the money-changers
cheating people and running a racket, He picked up a whip and yelled,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;It is written in the scriptures that God said,<br>
'My temple will be called a house of prayer for the people of all nations.'<br>
But you have made it into a hideout for thieves!&quot;<br>
</font>
(Mark 11:15. Also see Matthew 21:12 and Luke 19:45.)
</blockquote>
<p>
And then He whipped them from the Temple.<br>

<p>
Well A.A. is a lot like a corrupt Temple, full of liars and thieves and sexual predators.
They talk about God a lot, and pray a lot, but they don't bother to follow the rules of
any major respectable religion. There are
plenty of hypocrites who say the Lord's Prayer loudly at the end of the meeting,
and then make a beeline for that young female newcomer. 

<p>
The world should know that it was the Founder, Bill Wilson, who started that &quot;tradition&quot;.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Really love the baby duck pictures!

<p>
Here is a bit more for your archives, it is a recently published interview with
William White about the Straight Inc program.  There is some history and a
comparison to a Communist reform prison.  Straight was what the Communist
brainwashing prisons would have been if they had been converting people to the 12
steps rather than Communism.  And instead of Chairman Mao, Straight was endorsed by
the Reagan's and Bush's.

<p>

http://www.williamwhitepapers.com/pr/2011%20Marcus%20Chatfield.pdf</a>

<p>
The program was federally funded at first, then merely federally &quot;protected&quot;.... the
White House did fund raisers and telethons for Straight while Straight was sued over
and over.... There have not been any criminal lawsuits against the adults who
operated, protected or endorsed the program.

<p>
Anyway...for your archives...

Thank you for that information. Thank you very much. I find it simply appalling, almost
unbelievable, that
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Straight" target="_blank">such things are being done to our children</a>,
and our corrupt politicians endorse it.

<p>
It's actually worse than what is being done to suspected terrorists. When Arabs are
grabbed in the middle of the night and renditioned to secret prisons where they are
tortured, the perpetrators can at least rationalize that they are saving lives.
They can rationalize that they are torturing nasty murderous criminals who are planning
to kill a lot of people. ( &#8212; Which may or may not be true...)
<p>
When that is done to our children, there is no such rationalization.
Well, other than the lame excuse that they are &quot;saving the children from a life of
crime.&quot;
<p>
Doesn't it sound just like the justification for burning pretty girls at the stake for
witchcraft? &quot;We are saving her from Hell by burning the evil out of her.&quot;

<p>
It is also disgusting and appalling that there have been no prosecutions of the monsters
who ran Straight. They deserve to go to prison for a lot of years.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

How I wish you would take the New Age and spiritual community under task!

You did a fantastic job on your site.

<p>
Thanks, Alice

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Alice,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. The &quot;New Age and spiritual community&quot; is actually
too large and diverse a thing to be either praised or condemned as a whole.
It's a lot of different things, and different groups, and different people.
And since I lived through the whole flowering of the &quot;New Age&quot; movement, I
have a special fondness for some of those memories.
<p>
Still, I can't help but sadly notice that the vast majority of the gurus from the
'sixties and 'seventies turned out to be frauds, phonies, or failures.
<p>
More than half of them  &#8212;  both the foreign and domestic ones  &#8212;  
were just plain dishonest fakes from the very beginning,
just clever characters who noticed that American kids had lots of money, and it wasn't
hard to bamboozle them out of it with a bunch of &quot;spiritual&quot; slogans and double-talk.
<p>
The really sad cases were the people who were really genuine spiritual figures,
real fellow students on the path, who fell victim to temptation, usually lust for
women, wealth, power, or fame.
<p>
Out of the dozens of &quot;teachers&quot; who popped up during those years, I can count the
remaining ones who still have credibility and a good reputation on my fingers.

<p>
Right now I feel like I have my hands full just dealing with the &quot;recovery movement&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Pelicans fishing
</center>
<p>
Can you believe what the pelican on the right is doing? I had no idea that they could bend
their beaks like that. The pelican turns her lower jaw into a hoop for a fishing net, and scoops up
fish.
<p>
Talk about a creature perfectly adapted to her environment, or her diet...
<p>
And the pelican caught a fish, too. You can see the ends of the fish pushing out the pelican's
pouch on the left and right.

<p>

</center>
<p>
These pelicans like to fish in unison. They arrange themselves in a row like that, and they
all dip their beaks into the water and scoop for fish at the same time. The idea is,
if a fish flees from one beak, he swims right into the next one.
<p>
By the way, I think that is two mated pairs. The pelicans hang out in pairs, and they are
noticeably bonded to each other.
<p>
The first two pelicans, in the foreground, have black feathers on their heads,
and the other two don't. They may be different species, or different sub-species.
I'll have to get out a book and look them up.
<p>
Later: Wikipedia says that the pelicans with the black nape are in non-breeding plumage.
So, apparently, pure white heads are breeding plumage. But that doesn't mean that the ones
with black heads didn't breed: Wikipedia has a picture of a female with non-breeding plumage
sitting on eggs. She just reverted to non-breeding plumage very soon after mating and laying
eggs.

<p>
So do these pelicans have some nests hidden somewhere? I want to see little pelicans.

</center>
<p>
I got a lot of good photographs of the pelicans this day. When the day started,
I thought that I wouldn't get any. When I rode my bicycle up to the edge of the water,
I startled the four pelicans, who were very close to the shore,
and they flew away in fright. I thought, &quot;Well that blows that. They're gone.
I won't get any photographs of those guys today.&quot;
<p>
But they came back. There are a lot of fish in the ponds, and they were attracted by the
bread. When I threw the bread on the water for the ducks and geese who were in the
water, it was a race between the ducks and geese and the fish to see who got the bread
first. Lots of mouths would appear from below and just gobble down the bread.
The fish were having a feeding frenzy.
The pelicans followed the fish and came back near me, and they had their own feast.
<p>
After I fed the ducks and geese for a while, they grew comfortable with being
close to me, and they were all around me. I was surrounded by geese and hungry goslings, and the
ducks were getting in there and getting some bread however they could.
The pelicans saw that. They are very sharp, and they
noticed that I wasn't killing and eating the ducks or geese, even
though there were a lot of them around me within reach.
That made the pelicans feel safer, and they came closer.
They still insisted on keeping 20 or 30 feet of distance between them and me,
and they wouldn't come any closer to the shore than a dozen feet, but that is close
enough to get good shots with a telephoto lens.
<p>
After a while, everybody calmed down and I was just casually tossing bread to
the ducks and geese and carp, and the pelicans settled down for a big feed, and weren't
very concerned about me being there.

Well the book is finally done, will be officially released September 30,
2011 and your team and solution are in it! Wow, what a truck load of work! I
now truly understand why authors get that extra special attention in many
arenas, it's a whole ton of work to finish and publish a book!

<p>
In a few words, one thing that is unique about this book is our 5 master key
formula. In one of the keys we point people in the direction they need to go
in based on their own feedback in a personal trigger point evaluation.
That's where your resource comes in, may I say &#8212; brilliant!!!

<p>
I've attached a PDF copy of the book for your immediate reading. Check out
chapter eleven for your inclusion.

<p>
Just fyi in moving forward we are going to be doing an aggressive media
blitz. That means; live, radio, internet and tv etc opportunities for those
contributors who fit the need and have the desire. If you have contacts that
you think we might be a fit for please let me know as I am a third party
endorser and testimonial for your solution.

<p>
Well that's it for now. Please enjoy the book &#8212; you have contributed to its

I'm flattered that you posted my letter. I'm kind of disappointed that
Pitch Black didn't invent the term &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, though. That would
have been a sign of original thought.
<p>
And especially congrats on
quitting tobacco. That drug sounds horrid. I do have a vague idea what
smoking's like on your lungs, given that I was very prone to upper
respiratory infections as a kid, to the point of having double-digit
absences almost every quarter in school (if my elementary school had the
same attendance policy as my high school, I would never have gotten out
of 4th grade). Coughing while trying to catch my breath after running
around for a bit was not my idea of fun. Still isn't, actually.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Meatbag,
<p>
Yes, being addicted to tobacco is pretty much having a chronic lung disease.
Even when you aren't sick, you are sick. You just can't breathe very well.
You are always tired and out of breath.
And the longer you smoke, the less well you can breathe, until you aren't breathing
at all.
<p>
What a nightmare. Hard to believe that I did it for 30 years, and kept getting
sucked back into it after quitting it  &#8212;  even after quitting it for as long as
a year. Some people have called tobacco the most addicting drug on earth, and
I tend to believe it.
<p>
Ah, but finally, 10 years off of cigarettes. Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty,
I'm free at last.

I discovered that there is a downside to your site. I visited your site
within my new Haiku VM, and then I got a bunch of Google ads for 12-step
treatment centers when visiting other sites. Come on, Google, that's the
exact opposite of what I was looking at.  Pity Web+ doesn't have
NoScript and Adblock Plus, and the only BeOS/Haiku port of Firefox is
based on the 2.x series.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Either your web browser, or that &quot;Haiku VM&quot; is doing that to you.
Probably the browser.
It is doing something like &quot;framing&quot;,
where it inserts its own ads into the top or bottom or edges of my web pages.
<p>
I don't have any advertisements on my web site, not a one, not anywhere.
And Google isn't authorized to put any advertisements on my web pages.
But somebody, probably the browser author, has a deal with Google to place ads on
the web pages that you view. That's an underhanded trick, isn't it?
Get a new browser. Try Firefox.

<p>
I have received lots of offers for deals to run ads, but the ads
are almost always for 12-Step-oriented treatment centers, and of course I'm not
going to run ads for them. And then there is the problem of control. If I agree to
allow Google to place ads, what ads will they run? Do I get to choose?
Can I ban ads for treatment centers? Tobacco products? Alcohol? A.A.? Other bad things?
I decided that it would be simpler to just not run any ads.

<p>
I don't know anything about that &quot;Haiku VM&quot;. Is it an operating system that runs
on an iPad clone, like a Kindle or Google reader?  If so, you might search for
a hacked version of the program that eliminates that obnoxious behavior.
<p>
I just investigated, and sort of answered my own question. Haiku is a Linux offspring,
and it's probably clean.  Your browser is probably the culprit. Get a new browser.
<p>
P.S.: On re-reading your sentences there, I realize that you were saying that you get
the ads <i>after</i> reading my pages. So you were on some other pages that do allow
ads, and Google is screwing up and placing inappropriate ads? Yeh, I guess there isn't
any easy fix for that.

</font>
<p>
Incidentally, I think you and those AA true believers have just
indirectly inspired me to take up a new hobby. I was reading more of the
letters, and I thought, &quot;It's amazing how similar these true believer
emails are. Somebody could invent a drinking game out of the phrases
that appear most often.&quot; Of course, a drinking game would be unfair,
given that the ones who would enjoy the humor most can't play drinking
games. So, I thought of bingo cards, but there's way too much material
to use for those. And a 52-card deck isn't enough for even just the
slogans. I came up with the idea of trading cards, but those would
require better drawing skills than what I have scrawled in the margins
of my physics notebook. Therefore, I'm going to get a sketchbook and a
somewhat better pen than I currently have, and work on my drawing
skills, so I can draw those trading cards one of these days.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, great minds think alike. A while back, someone sent me a game called
&quot;Bullshit Bingo&quot;, where people play Bingo at A.A. meetings by marking off
slogans and hackneyed phrases on their cards.

As far as the South Park episode, that's what led me here in the first
place. While I was watching it, I opened up Rationalwiki on a whim and
looked up its article on AA. There, I found a link to your site.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, interesting. I'll have to check out &quot;Rationalwiki&quot;.
<p>
Yes, I just love that South Park episode. That and the one
that spoofs Scientology, two episodes earlier.

And after reading about your issues with AOL, I do have one question:
Are you related to John Peter Zenger?

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, not related.
<p>
But I just looked him up, and he's an interesting character:<br>

P.S.: 2011.09.29:<br>
I looked up &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, and found that it is from an ancient English folk song.
Musical historians have found versions as far back as 1568.
The song personifies the cereal grain barley, and describes in gruesome detail how
John Barleycorn must be buried and then harvested, and &quot;killed&quot;
&#8212;  milled and fermented and turned into alcohol  &#8212;  so that people may drink his blood:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There was three men come out o' the west their fortunes for to try,<br>
And these three men made a solemn vow, John Barleycorn must die,<br>
They ploughed, they sowed, they harrowed him in, throwed clods upon his head,<br>
And these three men made a solemn vow, John Barleycorn was dead.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Those medieval people sure had a weird morbid sense of humor.
<p>
Later, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; became slang for any ale or whiskey.

At least my childhood lung problems were pretty easily solved by some
steroids an ER doc prescribed me, after I had an allergic reaction to my
prescribed Keflex. Guess I didn't work a strong Keflex program. Then
again, it's a little unfair to compare Keflex and AA even jokingly,
since Keflex works great for the ~90% of people who aren't allergic to
it. Too bad the effects of smoking can't be reversed with a few pills.

Hi again, Meatbag,

I wasn't getting ads in your site, just from other sites that normally
have ads after visiting your site. Fortunately, I don't do much
web-browsing in my guest OSes, anyhow. And it's more of a minor nuisance
than anything. And Haiku isn't really a Linux offspring. It's a
successor to BeOS, which was a promising OS killed by Microsoft
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320022337/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS" target="_blank">
&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS&gt;</a>.
<p>
 Case in point.

&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_Flora_Prius&gt;</a>

<p>
 And VM is an
abbreviation of virtual machine. It's probably the easiest way to run
half a dozen different OSes without having that many physical machines.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Quite right. After re-reading your statement, I realized that Google was placing the
inappropriate ads on other pages <i>after</i> you read some Orange Papers pages.
That is a good example of a dumb computer program just grabbing a few key words, and
not understanding the message. Google needs to work on that, or soon they will be
placing advertisements for White Supremicists on Jewish web sites.

<p>
I realized that BeOS wasn't Linux later. I got fooled by a quick glance and seeing that
it uses GRUB as the boot loader. Which is classic Linux. So apparently Haiku is
borrowing some tools from Linux, which is a smart thing to do.
There is no profit in re-inventing the wheel.

</font>
<p>
And definitely check out Rationalwiki. You would probably enjoy it. They
have excellent articles on various forms of pseudoscience, among other
things. Try this article
