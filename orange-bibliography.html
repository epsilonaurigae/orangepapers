This is one of the most insane and vicious books around.
It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">hate content</a>, is concerned.
It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's
explanation of his Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, but it
is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">something quite
dark and evil</a>, Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for
human nature masquerading as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">all of his own
weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Look at him.
Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>
This whole book is non-stop guilt induction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
By the way, Bill Wilson said in a letter to Father Edward Dowling, S.J., that
he was getting &quot;good help&quot; in writing this book
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Boniface" target="_blank">from the spirits
&quot;over there&quot; in the spirit world</a> whom he contacted during
s&eacute;ances. Father Dowling answered that he feared that Bill might be messing
with evil lying spirits from the dark side. Who knows, maybe Bill was...<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), New York, 1967.<br>

Dewey: 616.861 ASB<br>
This is Bill Wilson's opinion on everything, writings selected
by AAWS.
This book reveals the immense hypocrisy of Bill Wilson. After stealing the A.A. publishing fund
and the copyright of the Big Book,
and selling Frank Buchman's cult religion as a quack cure for alcohol addiction,
and turning A.A. into his private harem of paid mistresses,
he yammered endless platitudes about spirituality and God and abandoning self-seeking, and on and on.
And even honesty.

Lois' book is pretty pathetic: it was probably ghost-written for her,

out in 1979, long after Bill's death, when she was also very
old and frail. The <i>Lois Remembers</i> book parrots much of
the standard party line in the <i>Big Book</i>, including the
ridiculous &quot;jealous of God and A.A.&quot; story:

<blockquote>

Slowly I recognized that because I had not been able
to &quot;cure&quot; Bill of his alcoholism, I
resented the fact that someone else had done so,
and I was jealous of his newfound friends...<br>

Two children of Doctor Bob describe an alcoholic father who
created a dysfunctional family.<br>
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Galbraith" target="_blank">
The autocratic Doctor Bob pressured his daughter Sue</a>
to spurn her high-school
sweetheart Ray Windows. Dr. Bob got the idea of using
&quot;A.A. Number Four&quot;, Ernie Galbraith, to break them up.
That resulted in the 32-year-old Ernie seducing 17-year-old Susan
and taking her for himself.
The marriage was a disaster, because Ernie Galbraith was a habitually unfaithful
drunken philanderer
(<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">just like Bill Wilson</a>).
He relapsed often, almost constantly. He never overcame his
alcohol addiction, in spite of the &quot;help&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Even worse, Ernie and Sue's daughter got pregnant at 16, and then killed herself
and her own little daughter with Ernie's shotgun a few years later,
in a double suicide-murder.
Bill Wilson quietly removed Ernie's story, <i>&quot;The Seven Month Slip&quot;</i>,
from the <i>Big Book</i> in 1955 when the second edition was published,
but Sue didn't get divorced from Ernie until 1965.
Then she finally married Ray Windows, her old
high-school sweetheart, after his first wife died.
Alcoholics Anonymous was nothing but a personal disaster for Dr. Bob's daughter.<br>
Then Robert Smith Jr.'s son, Dr. Bob's grandson, also committed suicide. That was one sick,
troubled family.<br>

They have found a power greater than themselves which they serve diligently.
And that gives them a charm that never was elsewhere on land and sea. It makes you
know that God Himself is really charming, because the AA people reflect His
mercy and His forgiveness.<br>

This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is
very positively slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author
knew Mr. Wilson and worked beside him for the last 12 years
of Mr. Wilson's life, and this book was prepared
from the set of autobiographical tape recordings that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's
warts, his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his
years-long &quot;dry drunks&quot;...

<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>

ISBN: 0-312-20056-0<br>
Dewey: B W11h 2000<br>
Francis Hartigan was the personal secretary of and confidant to Bill
Wilson's wife Lois. This book is pretty much a white-wash of Bill Wilson, and
tells the whole story from Bill's point of view. But it does
contain a few surprises, like the chapter &quot;The Other Woman&quot;
which details Bill's love affair with Helen Wynn, and hints at
all of his other affairs where he cheated on Lois, both before
and after sobriety, all of his married life.<br>
Hartigan also described
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Hartigan6" target="_blank">Bill Wilson taking LSD</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Note the interesting fact that Lois Wilson had her own private secretary.
That doesn't quite jibe with the published image of Bill and Lois
as a couple of desperately poor people who were always struggling
just to survive. The A.A. propagandists fail to tell you that Bill
Wilson managed to arrange A.A. finances so that he and Lois lived like
royalty in their A.A.-supplied house, while driving an A.A.-supplied
Cadillac car and being supported in comfort for the
rest of their lives by the Alcoholics Anonymous organization,
with private secretaries and <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">a stable of mistresses</a>
even. So much for
the much-ballyhooed &quot;unselfish, constructive action&quot; and
&quot;abandoning self-seeking&quot; and
and &quot;having no thought of the profit motive&quot;
that Wilson always promoted (for others).

This book was written by another stepper &#8212; the name 'Matthew Raphael'
is a pen name &#8212; and it generally praises Bill Wilson and recites
the party line about most things, but it also contains a bunch
of surprises, like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his
and Bob's spook sessions &#8212; talking to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances
through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping, and channeling,
LSD use, and publicity-hound megalomania.

Another biography of Bill Wilson written by a stepper with a bad case of
hero worship. She glosses over and rationalizes all of Bill Wilson's faults.
She even implies that Bill Wilson was right when he was conducting s&eacute;ances &#8212;
that he really was talking to the spirits of the dead.<br>

<i>I'll Cry Tomorrow</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Lillian Roth<br>
Frederick Fell Publishers, Inc., 386 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10016.<br>
ISBN: 0-88391-074-8<br>
Dewey: 792 R84<br>
This is the story of a child movie star, popular in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties, who was
a hard-core, ruined, dying alcoholic by the age of 34. Her descriptions of the horrors of
alcoholism and addiction to alcohol are some of the most candid and graphic around.
After treatment in a mental hospital and a relapse,
she ostensibly found happiness in Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>
The 12 steps and the religious nature of the A.A. program got a mere 2 pages (232-233),
most of which was spent in reprinting the 12 steps and repeating the slogan
that <i>&quot;It isn't religious, it's spiritual&quot;</i>, and then she
had lots of fun being a member of a secret society, starting up the first A.A. group
in New Zealand (pages 256-259).<br>
Unfortunately, this book is a very shallow treatment
of the A.A. program. Also unfortunate was the fact that A.A. didn't work
for her either. Nell Wing, Bill Wilson's secretary,
wrote that Lillian Roth returned to drinking, just like so many of the other
early A.A. members and &quot;pioneers&quot; (A.A. promoters).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This book fulfills the promise that <i>&quot;If it's from Hazelden, you
know it's propaganda.&quot;</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The back cover starts the falsehoods:
It says that Mrs. Marty Mann was a
<font color="#5f008f" face="Swiss, Helvetica">
'Pioneer public health reformer
and author of &quot;Women Suffer Too,&quot; the first story written
by a woman in the Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book.'<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No, it wasn't. Florence Rankin
was the author of the story <i>&quot;A Feminine Victory&quot;</i> in the
first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>. Back in 1939, when the <i>Big Book</i>
first came out, Marty Mann was still a patient in
Blythewood Sanitarium in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Dr. Harry Tiebout handed her an early multilith copy of the
<i>Big Book</i> to read, and she became a true believer.
But Florence Rankin relapsed and disappeared, so Bill Wilson took
her story out and put Marty's story in the second edition, and ever
since, they have been trying to cover up the fact that Marty Mann
was not the first woman in A.A. &#8212; that the real first A.A.
woman actually went out and died drunk. (She is said to have committed suicide
in Washington, D.C..)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After Marty sobered up, she dedicated her life to the cult, and
spent the rest of her life campaigning for A.A., and proselytizing,
breaking her anonymity
and promoting A.A. in violation of the Eleventh Tradition:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather
than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the
level of press, radio, and films.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Marty Man founded the National Council on Alcoholism (NCA), which was renamed
to the National Council on Alcohol and Drug Dependency (NCADD), which
exists solely to promote 12-Step everything.

Another very standard, sanitized, history of Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>
Full of factual errors, white-washes, and cover-ups.<br>
For instance, on page 69 we are told
that Henry Parkhurst just ran Honor Dealers and loaned Bill his secretary
Ruth Hock, while Bill Wilson wrote all eleven of the opening chapters
of the <i>Big Book</i>. That is wrong. That is
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's lie</a>.
Henry wrote the <i>&quot;To Employers&quot;</i> chapter
for sure, and probably much more.
Henry even outlined and structured the entire book.
(<a href="hank38.pdf" target="_blank">See the document here</a>.)
Bill Wilson minimized Hank's work because Bill stole all of it.<br>
On page 70 the authoress admits that Bill Wilson, and not Lois,
wrote the <i>&quot;To Wives&quot;</i> chapter, but offers us no reason for
Bill's deceptive claim that &quot;The Wives of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;
wrote it.<br>
This authoress just goes along with Bill Wilson's statements on everything.<br>

<i>A History of Addiction &amp; Recovery in the United States</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Michael Lemanski<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731, 2001.<br>
ISBN: 1-884365-26-4<br>
Dewey: 362.29180973 or 362.2918 L547h<br>
Also from See Sharp Press, another excellent critical analysis
of the whole recovery industry, including A.A., treatment centers,
and &quot;codependency therapy&quot;.<br>

<i>Addiction, Change &amp; Choice; The New View of Alcoholism</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Vince Fox, M.Ed. CRREd.<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731, 1993.<br>
ISBN: 0-9613289-7-5<br>
Dewey: 362.29286i FOX<br>
And yet another great book from the See Sharp Press.
Fox covers:
<ol>
<li> Heavy Drinking: Its Historical Context
<li> Alcoholism: Definitions &amp; Opinions
<li> Polarization: Us vs. Them
<li> The Objective: Personal Autonomy
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Essence &amp; Functions
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Effectiveness
<li> The Forces &amp; Directions of Change
<li> The Independent Self-Help Programs
<li> Rational Recovery Systems Network
<li> Traditional Recovery Management
<li> Nontraditional Recovery Management
<li> Noninstitutional Recovery
<li> ...and more...
</ol>
One of the things I like best is how Fox stresses just
how damaging and dangerous it is for A.A. and N.A. to teach
addicts that they are powerless over alcohol or their addiction, and
have no choice in the matter. That is a ready-made rationalization
for a drunkard to have another drink, and for a doper to shoot up again.
And that is what the steppers do.
Fox also does a good job of criticizing the arrogant
<i>&quot;My way or the highway&quot;</i>
attitude of self-righteous A.A. and N.A. sponsors.

A fair and balanced study of Alcoholics Anonymous. There is nothing particularly
new or revealing about this information; it's just a long and neutral analysis.
As such, it unfortunately side-steps a few important questions like &quot;How
well do it really work?&quot;
<p>
<blockquote>

An interesting expos&eacute; of Alcoholics Anonymous, coming from both
a scientific and biblical point of view:
<i>&quot;The real truth from the Bible and science about addictions and
codependence &#8212; and how you can be free of them!&quot;</i><br>
In spite of its very unusual approach, this book makes a lot of good
points, and clearly shows that A.A. dogma is false both from a medical
and theological viewpoint, as in:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The irony of a Twelve Step program customized for Christians is that many
who use it believe it is not only effective but Biblical.
... If the original Twelve Step program needs to be &quot;adapted&quot; for
Christians, it seems odd to say that it is &quot;Biblically based.&quot;
What kind of double talk is going on here? Unfortunately, this kind of
confusion is characteristic of the literature of &quot;Christianized&quot;
recovery programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After all is said and done, Christians do not seem to be making the recovery
industry approach more compatible with Biblical Christianity. On the contrary,
the recovery industry seems to be influencing the Christian approach.<br>

This is just the usual 12-Step dogma, cut and pasted by a paper shredder.
&#8212; Meaning, there is not a single new, different, creative, or
original thought in the whole book; it's just
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Gorski1" target="_blank">the same old stuff</a>,
slightly rearranged.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What is curious is the fact that three years later, Terence Gorski
quite perceptively denounced the entire Adult Children of Alcoholics
and co-dependency movement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In 1992, Terence Gorski, a prominent spokesperson within the
field of addictions, addressing a conference of the
National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, stated:
<blockquote>
If I were hired by the enemies of the chemical dependency field
... I couldn't give them a better strategy [to destroy
the field] than the adult children of alcoholics movement and
the codependency movement. When we as a field
expanded addictions to include all compulsive disorders we
destroyed our constituency base ... destroyed our
funding base ... destroyed our economic stability.<br>

More of the same old stuff. Once again, you will be taught how to
work the 12 steps. The author does try to dress this book up a bit with
&quot;personality tests&quot; and the like, but the answers are all
the usual 12-Step theology and pseudo-psychology.

LC: HV5132.N35 2000<br>
Dewey: 362.2913-dc21 or 362.29 N163r 2000<br>
More 12-Step cult baloney, this time from the Hazelden publishing plant.
Again, we are treated to the standard stereotypes of spouses and children of alcoholics,
culminating in a recomendation that we join the 12-step cult religion.
And as usual, the author manages to twist things around in a bait-and-switch
con game. The author starts with the usual come-on, sympathizing about
how unfortunate it was that you were the abused child of
an alcoholic, or the spouse of an alcoholic.
Then the author switches to declarations that you are wrong about most everything.
Spouses of addicts, whom the author calls &quot;co-addicts&quot;,
are invited to join Alcoholics Anonymous or Al-Anon with these statements:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Members of these recovery programs read, talk with others who have had similar
experiences, and study the spiritual principles found within the Twelve Steps.
Individuals are encouraged to understand how they, not their partners, have betrayed
these principles. We are encouraged to see what we did wrong, not what others
did. Taking our own inventories helps us define our own behavior and motivation.
Members are supported in taking a long and hard look at how addiction has changed them.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Page 148.
</font>
</blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
Excuse me, but <i>whose</i> addiction has &quot;changed them&quot;? Who says that
the wives and children of alcoholics have done anything wrong, or &quot;betrayed principles&quot;?
This is just more of the crazy 12-Step cult's guilt-induction routine.

<i>Codependent No More: How to Stop Controlling Others and Start Caring for Yourself</i>

Again, more codependency nonsense and quack psychiatric advice.
How to stop caring about sick people and &quot;have a love affair with yourself&quot;.
And then how to work a 12-Step program.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Beattie gave this kind of advice on how to attain happiness &#8212; This is 
her rap where she compared the benefits of real therapy to the benefits
of membership in the 12-Step cult Al-Anon.
She wrote that therapy is a luxurious ocean liner, and Al-Anon is a small invisible boat:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...Of course, we'll get on the ocean liner, the luxury cruise.
The next thing we know, we're heading for that island of happiness.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;
The problem is, about mid-way across the water, the ocean liner stops, turns around, and heads back
to the shore where we started from. Then the captain orders everyone off of the ship.
When we ask, &quot;Why?&quot; he says, &quot;Our cruise only goes so far.
The only way you can ever get to that island
is by getting in the invisible boat (called Al-Anon).&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Page 178.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, Melody Beattie declared that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank">the cult is The Only Way</a> to find happiness,
and regular medical treatment is useless. No wonder the 12-Step propaganda house of Hazelden
published this.

LC: BR110.B54 1989<br>

This book challenges the opinions of Dr. James Dobson, which the
authors consider to be heresy masquerading as psychology.
Hence the name &quot;psychoheresy&quot;. Chapter 17 is
another expos&eacute; of A.A. and A.C.A. from a fundamentalist

<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;
William James<br>
The Modern Library, New York, 1994. (Reprint)<br>
(Originally printed in 1902.)<br>
ISBN: 0-679-60075-2<br>
Dewey: 201 J23v 1994<br>
This is the classic tome on religious experiences which has been
praised by everybody from Bill Wilson to Aldous Huxley to Timothy
Leary. This is also the book that gave Bill Wilson the idea of
making the second half of the <i>Big Book</i> all stories of
people's A.A. experiences. Large sections of James' book are filled with
stories about people's religious experiences, including many stories of
people who had religious experiences and immediately stopped drinking and
never drank alcohol again. Bill Wilson copied both the content and the style there.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Note that the famous quote about religious mania being the only cure for alcoholism
that Bill Wilson repeatedly attributed to Carl Jung actually came from this book.
Footnote 1 on page 263 of <i>Varieties</i> says:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
'&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot;
is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical man.'</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
William James published <i>Varieties</i> in 1902, but he didn't meet Carl Jung
until 1909, so it is unlikely that James got that line from Jung.

This book will curl your hair. One fair-minded 12-Stepper suggested that

the good and the bad things that could happen to them in &quot;the rooms.&quot;
One of the most disturbing repeated themes is women who were the victims
of rape or thirteenth-stepping being told to just shut up and find their
part in it and go make some coffee, and to not harbor any resentments
against their attackers.

&quot;The wrong kinds
of prayer can be a form of black magic, for when we seek to use
a supernatural force to help us achieve our goals, it ceases to be
supernatural and becomes superhuman. To make God into a servant
is to place him under our superhuman power. Yet is this not exactly
what we have long been taught to do? To get down on our knees and
pray for God to go to work for us?&quot;

So if we ask for God's help, we are practicing black magic?<br>
And if you ask God to help you quit drinking and doping,
is that black magic?<br>

Dewey: 362.2928 R183r<br>
This book is an interesting mixture of good advice and the same
old bad 12-Step garbage. For instance:
(pages 110,111)
<ul>
<li> Cut down on caffeine, nicotine, and sugar.
<li> Stay away from people who anger, threaten, frustrate or
intimidate you, including old drinking buddies.
<li> Listen to music. It really does soothe the savage breast.
<li> &quot;Persist in working the 12 steps of AA. Each is a stepping stone
toward serenity.&quot;
<li> &quot;Continue going to AA meetings. The mere act of attendance helps
to lower stress.&quot;
</ul>
Actually, many people, including me, have noticed that going to
AA meetings <i>makes us want to drink</i> even more.
And I have an ex-junkie friend who swears that N.A. meetings make
him want to shoot dope, and that's why he doesn't go.

Dewey: 362.293<br>
Describes the Towns-Lambert &quot;belladonna cure&quot; that Bill Wilson
was given in Town's Hospital (pages 247-250) for his alcoholism.
The belladonna cure started off as a cure for
opium addiction, but Charles Towns &quot;turned into a perfect crackpot&quot;
and pushed the belladonna cure as a panacea &#8212; a cure-all.
Note that Charles Towns was &quot;a Georgia insurance salesman who made a fortune
dosing middle-class addicts with hyoscyamine and strychnine...&quot; (p.248)
Towns was not a doctor.<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... before long [Towns] was billing his cure as guaranteed to work for <i>any
compulsive behavior</i>, from morphinism to nicotinism to caffeinism,
to kleptomania and bedwetting.<br>
</font> (p. 249.)
</blockquote>
Dr. Lambert then dissociated himself from Charles Towns and his hospital.
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Lambert's defection from the Towns-Lambert Cure was also based on the
need to revise his cure estimate significantly downward; as time went on,
he began to notice that people kept coming back for the cure, cure after
cure, for years on end.<br>
</font> (p. 249.)

<i>Twelve-Step Guide To Using The Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book</i>

Capizon Publishing, Torrance, California, 2004.<br>
ISBN: 0-9659672-2-0<br>
Dewey: 362.2928 K11t 2001<br>
This book says that prayer is the answer to everything. Literally. The word prayer appears on
almost every page.
Herb K. has a prayer for every one of the Twelve Steps, and then more prayers as exercises, then
more, and more...
<ul>
<li> &quot;This man, Jerry R., introduced me to a very structured method of approaching the <i>Big Book</i>
based on ... Prayer, Reading, Consideration/reflection, Writing, Discussion.&quot; (p. 6)
<li> &quot;He asked me to pray each time I sat down to do any of the assignments.&quot; (p. 7)
<li> &quot;Therefore, my instructions begin by asking you to use the
following 'set aside' prayer: 'God, please let me set aside everything that I think I know
about myself, my disease, the Twelve Steps and you, God...'&quot; (p. 20)

LC: HV5045.W55 1998<br>
Dewey: 362.292'86&#8212;dc21<br>
This is an authoritive book that purports to be a neutral study of
A.A. and A.A. thinking, but it echoes the standard party line far too
much. It basically manages to condense all of the dogma and misinformation
in the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i> and reprint it in 124 pages.
It repeats all of the standard doctrines, like &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;,
and only criticizes the most ridiculous aspects of A.A., like the superstitious
use of A.A. coins as magical charms or fetishes, and the
&quot;no medications&quot; beliefs of members.<br>

<i>Clinical Supervision in Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counseling</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; David J. Powell, with Archie Brodsky<br>
Jossey-Bass, an imprint of Wiley, San Francisco, 2004.<br>
ISBN: 0-7879-7377-7 (alk. paper)<br>
LC: HV5276.P68 2004<br>
Dewey: 362.2918 P882c 2004<br>
A book that tries to teach people how to supervise drug and alcohol counselors.
Unfortunately, the model of treatment advanced is called &quot;The Blended Model&quot;,
which is just a mish-mash of everything that has already failed, like Alcoholics Anonymous
and the so-called &quot;Minnesota Model&quot;.
The book advances A.A. with arguments like
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
'The twelve-step movement has been
called &quot;the greatest social movement of the twentieth century&quot; (Naisbitt and
Aburdene 1990).'<br>
</font> (Page 147.)<br>
</blockquote>

It isn't a movement, it's a cult religion, and it's also been called the biggest
failure of the century in alcoholism treatment.
The authors continue:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;In the twelve-step approach, two primary goals &#8212; acceptance and surrender &#8212;
form the basis for early recovery from alcoholism or addiction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>Acceptance</i> is the breakdown of the illusion that through will-power alone
one can limit or control substance abuse. ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>Surrender</i> involves a reaching out for help beyond oneself...&quot;<br>
</font>
(Pages 147-148.)<br>
</blockquote>
There is that deceptive phrase again &#8212; &quot;through will-power alone&quot;.
People don't use only will power to shape their lives &#8212;
they use the desire to avoid sickness and death,
desire to have a better life, fear of death, desire for a better sex life,
desire for a successful career, a lot of different things to determine their future lives.
But the parrots of Bill's Bull keep on yammering
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html#singlehanded" target="_blank">Bill's line</a>
about how you cannot succeed
&quot;<a href="orange-letters41.html#willpower" target="_blank">through will-power alone</a>&quot;.<br>
And of course their answer to alcoholism is to surrender to a cult.

<i>How to Spot Hidden Alcoholics; Using Behavioral Clues to Recognize Addiction
in its Early Stages</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Doug Thorburn<br>
Galt Publishing, Northridge, California, 2004.<br>
ISBN: 0-9675788-6-8<br>
LCCN: 2003114993<br>
This book pushes the worst kind of quackery.
Doug Thorburn is a financial planner who for some reason decided to
spend a year sitting in A.A. meetings, listening to their stories, and
then he decided that
he's now an expert on alcoholism. This book puts forth the worst kind of stereotype
of &quot;the alcoholic&quot;.
Believe it or not, Thorburn says that some of the key factors
that will reveal a hidden alcoholic to you include:
<ol>
<li> Over-achiever, due to a need to win at any cost
<li> Regularly uses foul language
<li> Smokes cigarettes
<li> Extraordinarily charming
<li> Occupational choices that allow the wielding of power or ease of use
<li> Engages in risky behavior in reckless fashion
<li> Has a &quot;the rules don't apply to me&quot; attitude
<li> Compulsive gambler
<li> Pontificates
<li> and so on....
</ol>
And this one is totally over the top:
The very first of Doug Thorburn's &quot;physical signs of early-stage alcoholism&quot;
is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;1. Has an ethnic background with a higher risk of alcoholism.&quot;</font><br>
Thorburn explains:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
African-Americans, totalling only 12% of the American population, comprise
40% of prison inmates. Rather than suggesting that this racial group
consists of more &quot;bad&quot; people than do those of other ancestries,
or that white cops are more likely to arrest non-whites, we might
consider the possibility that people of certain ancestries have a
greater genetic predisposition to alcoholism than do others.<br>
</font>
(Page 75.)<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, being black is a physical sign of early-stage alcoholism?<br>
Those Blacks are just born alcoholics?

<i>Smashed; Story of a Drunken Girlhood</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Koren Zailckas<br>
Viking, the Penguin Group, New York and London, 2005.<br>
ISBN: 0-670-03376-6<br>
LC: HV5293.Z35A3 2005<br>
Dewey: 616.861092&#8212;dc21 or 616.861 Z21s 2005<br>
An interesting, easily-read drunkalogue that is somehow quite clear about the
whole thing. The authoress explains that she does not consider herself an
alcoholic; she calls herself an alcohol abuser, and explains that she started
drinking very early, like at 14, and drank heavily all through high school and
college, and then she quit drinking when it became too expensive.

<i>The Glass Castle; a memoir</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeanette Walls<br>
Scribner, New York, NY, 2005.<br>
ISBN: 0-7432-4753-1<br>
LC: HV5132.W35 2005<br>
Dewey: 362.82092&#8212;dc22 or B Wa1589g 2005<br>
A really great book. The authoress describes a terribly harsh and deprived
childhood as the daughter of a crazy alcoholic father and an equally
crazy mother who fancied herself an artist.
The authoress' candidness is refreshing.
And she finally manages to escape &#8212; and to get all of her siblings away from the parents and to
a saner environment &#8212; without resort to Al-Anon, Adult Children of Alcoholics, or any
such guilt-inducing 12-step nonsense.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What puzzles me most is just what you would call the kind of insanity
that the father exhibited. Whatever it was, it was the cause, not the
effect, of the alcoholism.  The father was crazy long before he started
drinking heavily. The cause might have been that he was also an abused
child of alcoholics. When he took his family back to West Virginia to
live with his mother, the authoress saw that Grandma kept a bottle of
liquor hidden in a pocket of her dress, and she was as crazy as Father
was, even trying to molest the authoress' younger brother.

<i>Twice-Born Men, A Clinic In Regeneration, A Footnote In Narrative to

&nbsp; &nbsp; Harold Begbie<br>
Fleming H. Revell Company, New York, Chicago, Toronto, London,
and Edinburgh, 1909.<br>
Dewey: 248 B41<br>
The importance of this book is only that it leads to the next one.
This book consists of several stories of religious conversion
of criminals and other sociopaths, reminiscent of the stories in William James' book
<i>&quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;</i>.
The next book appears to be the same thing, but is in fact just
a glorification of Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman as he converts people.

<p><br>
<i>More Twice-Born Men, Narratives of a Recent Movement in the Spirit of Personal Religion</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Harold Begbie<br>
G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, The Knickerbocker Press, 1923.<br>
Dewey: 248 B41m<br>
This book fawns over and glorifies Dr. Frank Buchman as a religious leader.
For some strange reason, perhaps a conceit of modesty, Frank Buchman is never
explicitly named; he is always referred to as &quot;F.B.&quot;.
This book is basically a collection of stories of Frank Buchman making converts.
As a historical document, it does give a peek into another world.

More Oxford Group propaganda, written by a true believer in the cult.
This book is especially good for the glimpse into Buchman's world
that it gives. Just don't expect the stories to be entirely accurate

This book is a total white-wash of Frank Buchman, and large parts of it

which Buchman really did.<br>

LC: BV4935.K5A2 1934a<br>
Another pathetic piece of propaganda. It follows the standard formula
of &quot;I was miserable. My life was pointless. All I was doing was making
big money on Wall Street. And then the stock market crashed and I
was <i>really</i> miserable. 'I was not going to be able to
accumulate a fortune enabling me to retire within twenty years.' (Page 8.)
My wife and children didn't like me either.
But then I discovered Frank Buchman's cult religion, and I dedicated my
life to that, and now I am so happy.&quot;<br>
Still, this book is valuable for the insight it gives into the Oxford
Group cult.<br>

<i>The Message of Frank Buchman</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; R. C. Mowat
(Formerly Scholar of Hertford College, Oxford; Lecturer in History,
Royal Naval College, Greenwich)<br>
Blandford Press, London, 1951.<br>
If it was printed by Blandford Press, you know it's pro-MRA propaganda,
and this small 58-page booklet is no exception.
It only uses eight other MRA books for its source material.
It abounds with such double-talk as, &quot;Moral Re-Armament is the
ideology of inspired democracy&quot; (page 14) without seeing any problem
with the total lack of elections in MRA &#8212; nobody ever elected Frank Buchman
or any of the other leaders of the Oxford Group or MRA. To the Buchmanites,
absolute dictatorships were &quot;democracy&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The back cover sums up the author's attitude:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After more than 6,000 years of development, civilization is faced
with collapse. The only alternative to catastrophe, barbarism and
a Dark Age &#8212; possibly to the extinction of mankind &#8212; would seem to
be the coming of a type of society more advanced than civilization
as we know it. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The author maintains that significant experiments in building such
a society have taken place during the last 2,000 years.
He traces their effect on the social relations and culture of the
world around, and concludes that there is a pattern of society which
could be carried into effect by a 'creative minority' with a global
strategy and the necessary dynamism to overcome the challenge of
materialistic totalitarian forces.
The author believes that an examination of the world scene reveals
that through Moral Re-Armament this is already taking place.<br>

More praise of Frank Buchman from Peter Howard.
Peter Howard is the man who took over the leadership of Moral
Re-Armament when Frank Buchman died. As you can imagine, he was
a true believer and had nothing but praise for Buchman.
This book is some of the most outrageous, grandiose, propaganda

Some pretty intense garbage.

this book will give you a good view. Some quotes:

Peter Howard is the man who took over leadership of the

This is a collection of his speeches on a variety of subjects,

Dewey: 248 E62m<br>
More pure propaganda from a couple of life-long members of Frank Buchman's cult.
Basil Entwistle was a British draft dodger who came to the USA to avoid
the British draft during World War II, and John McCook Roots was the son
of Bishop Logan Roots, who threw Frank Buchman out of China in the
nineteen-twenties, only to later become a true believer convert to
Buchmanism.<br>
Pace Publications was the publishing house of MRA in the USA.<br>
Still, this book contains some interesting
history, including a selection of speeches by Frank Buchman and Peter Howard,
both of whom had died by the time this book was written.
This book also covers the last days of the cult, including the
<i>Sing Out</i> and <i>Up With People</i> productions.

An unpublished term paper for a Moral Theology class, May 19, 1968.<br>
I question some of the author's assumptions about how Moral Re-Armament was okay with
the Catholic Church.
In particular, he states that he wrote to the office
of Bishop Noa of Marquette (Detroit, Michigan, USA),
about the Bishop's criticism of MRA (published <a href="#Bishop_Marquette" target="_blank">here</a>),
and was told that the Bishop had changed his mind completely and that MRA was
okay now. Excuse me, but the Bishop of Marquette cannot change the Pope's
mind for him. It was a <i>Vatican ban</i> on MRA, not the Bishop's ban.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; C. Irving Benson<br>
Humphrey Milford Oxford University Press, Cathedral Buildings, Melbourne, Australia, 1936.<br>
Dewey: 248 B47<br>
This is a very pro-Buchman book. It is practically a how-to manual
for Buchmanism. As such, it sometimes degenerates into absurdity and
double-talk, like this footnote on page 45. After asking,
&quot;Are absolute love, purity, honesty, and unselfishness possible?&quot;,
Benson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There is no need to raise questions of metaphysics or philosophy
and argue about the word 'absolute,' the real meaning of which
nobody knows. 'Absolute' is used by the Group in the practical
sense and means 'perfect.'<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Funny, but all of my dictionaries know what the word &quot;absolute&quot;
means...
And it's odd that the author thinks that &quot;perfect&quot; is
more practical and attainable than &quot;absolute.&quot;
The author overlooks the fact that both &quot;absolute&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; are
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_perfection" target="_blank">ridiculous cultish demands
for super-human perfection</a>.
<p>
This advertising-slogan double-talk is good too:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Oxford Group Movement is not a new religion; it is religion
anew. Every upsurge of spiritual life in the history of Christianity
has been the rediscovery and re-emphasis of neglected truths.<br>
</font>
&#8212; Page 58.

Yes, like the forgotten and neglected truths that Adolf Hitler and
Heinrich Himmler were really great fellows.

(Salt Lake City Public Library, 210 East 400 South,
Salt Lake City, Utah, 84111)<br>
This is a fascinating piece of history.
It is a large collection of photographs and newspaper articles about Frank
Buchman, the Oxford Group Movement, and Moral Re-Armament that come
mostly from the period of time right around World War II.
Arthur Strong was a British photographer who fell under the sway of Frank Buchman,
and who travelled with Buchman's flag-waving pseudo-patriotic road shows during
the period of 1939 to 1946. Arthur Strong assembled a travelogue of that period.<br>

(Arthur Strong also apparently fell under Buchman's commandment not to
serve in the military,
because that British citizen stayed in the USA during the war years
from 1939 to 1946, while Britain was begging all citizens to come home
and help out. In fact, Arthur Strong was one
of the British subjects named in
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#draft_tamper3" target="_blank">the draft-tampering scandal</a>.)<br>

This book is hopeless biased towards
Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group/MRA &#8212; it was assembed by a die-hard
true believer many decades after Buchman's death, and he actually treated
the manuscript as if it
were some kind of a holy scripture, to be enshrined in a specially-made
wooden box (see the photograph of the box in the beginning of the book)
&#8212; but it is still a tremendous wealth of photographs and other historical documents
for historians.

<i>Come Wind, Come Weather</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Daphne du Maurier<br>
Printed in Great Britain in August 1940.<br>
Printed in USA by Doubleday, Doran and Company, Inc., New York, 1941.<br>
LC: BV4915.D8<br>
A book of short stories of Buchmanites coping with the early part of
World War Two in Europe.
The authoress displayed the usual grandiose exaggeration of the benefits of
Buchman's teachings, along with minimization and denial of its total
failure to prevent the war. This is only thinly-veiled Buchmanite propaganda &#8212;
page 15 specifically endorsed Moral Re-Armament by name. We can also
very clearly see the philosophical roots of Alcoholics Anonymous here.
Du Maurier summarized several stories this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Megan saw she was a dictator in the home;<br>
George saw that drink and dishonesty were only attempts to escape from his own
defeat;<br>
... Anna that misfortune is no excuse for bitterness and self-pity.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">Page 74.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
In other words,
<ul>
<li> Megan needs to join Al-Anon and quit being
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Thumb" target="_blank">such a domineering bitch</a>.

<li> George needs to join A.A..

<li> Anna also needs to join Al-Anon and quit being so
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good" target="_blank">self-pitying</a> and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#wife_unhappy" target="_blank">resentful</a>.

by Helen Hardinge<br>
Longmans, Green And Co. Ltd., London, 1960.<br>
LC: BJ10.M6M33 1960<br>
Another book of propaganda that glories Frank Buchman and MRA. The majority of
the book consists of autobiographical stories of being saved from adversity
by being converted to belief in Buchmanism. Then the section called
<i>&quot;The Universal Man &#8212; Frank Buchman&quot;</i> is a fawning piece of hero worship
and glorification of the cult leader, on the level of:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One of the veterans of American Communism said, 'I trained 300 men in
Communism, and most of them have left me. What is Frank Buchman's secret, that
the men he has trained remain faithful?'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(page 159.)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
That stubbornly ignores, of course,
the fact that Frank Buchman's cult also had
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#OG_dropouts" target="_blank">an immense drop-out rate</a>.
Once again, the cult members are in denial.

at Andover Newton Theological School</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; T. Willard Hunter<br>
Self-published, 1977.<br>
LC: BJ10.M6H8 1977<br>
This is a strange document. It is a large piece of work, 200 pages,
very well researched, and it is a source of obscure information that I've seen
nowhere else, but unfortunately the author was a true believer in Buchmanism,
and rarely criticized it.
The author was a contemporary of Frank Buchman and a devoted Buchmanite.
He was also a member of Moral Re-Armament for many years, and spent the war years of WWII touring
the country with Buchman's jingoistic shows.
He just rhapsodized about Buchman's &quot;great
accomplishments&quot; and dismissed or minimized his faults and failings.
He even wrote of his own judgement on the subject of Buchman:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The writer's claims to objectivity are slim. He knew and worked with Frank
Buchman and became one of his good friends. He gave his entire time &#8212; his
life, fortune, and sacred honor &#8212; to this work for eighteen years. A psychologist
would say of such a person that it would be difficult for him to avoid
seeking to justify himself.<br>

The author tries to present a fair and objective description of
Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group Movement. He does a fair job of it.
He really minimized incidents like Buchman's getting kicked out
of Princeton, praise for Hitler
and the Nazis, appeasement of Hitler, and draft-dodging by Oxford

<i>The Mystery of Moral Re-Armament, A Study of Frank Buchman and
His Movement</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Tom Driberg<br>
Secker &amp; Warberg, London, 1964.<br>
Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1965.<br>
LC: BJ10 .M6D7<br>
LCCN: 64-19084<br>
Dewey number 248.25 D831<br>
This is a great book, one of the most detailed, well-documented,
and complete sources of information about Frank Buchman and
his religious movement. And it is easy, fascinating reading,
written by a fellow who didn't pull his punches when criticizing
Buchman. It was written by Tom Driberg, a fellow who was a colorful
personality in his own right, starting as a newspaper reporter
in London, and then becoming one of the first openly-gay Members of
Parliament in history.
And on top of that, he joined the Communist Party in Britain in the 1930s,
and when he grew disgusted with it and was going to quit, was recruited as
an agent by the British secret intelligence service, MI5, to spy on the
Communists, which he did until his cover was blown in 1946 and the Communist
Party kicked him out.
In the early nineteen-sixties, the London
publishing house of Secker &amp; Warburg asked Driberg to do a book
on Buchman and the MRA, since he had previously reported on them.

This is MRA's answer to Tom Driberg's book on MRA. It sarcastically
nit-picks everything in Driberg's book, and denies and tries
to explain away every fault of Buchman and MRA.

Blandford Press, London, 1958.<br>
LC: BJ10.M6<br>

A book of praise of Frank Buchman, put together by his followers for his

<i>Saints Run Mad; A Criticism of the &quot;Oxford&quot; Group Movement</i>

John Lane the Bodley Head Ltd., London, 1934.<br>
LC: BV4915.H37 1934<br>
Dewey: 248 H24<br>
This is an excellent critique of Frank Buchman's cult. Marjorie Harrison
was there, and attended many Oxford Group meetings, and even interviewed
Frank Buchman for this book. Her stories give a feeling of immediacy and presence
that is not found in other histories. She basically rips Buchman
and his flawed theology to shreds, and this
was before Buchman's notorious praise for Adolf Hitler.<br>

Edited by R. H. S. Crossman<br>
Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1934.<br>
LC: BV4915.C7<br>
This is a great little book; very informative. It consists of essays
from both leaders of the Oxford Groups like Rev. G. F. Allen, and
criticisms of the Groups from critics like R. H. S. Crossman, and
Miss B. E. Gwyer. It gives
you a first-hand look at the Groups from several viewpoints, a snap-shot
in time of the thinking of contemporaries, before Buchman's public praise
of Adolf Hitler. All of the authors were somehow associated with Oxford
University in 1934; most were faculty, a few were clergy.

Duke University Press, Durham, North Carolina, 1950.<br>
LC: BV4915 .E35<br>
My over-all impression of this otherwise fine book is that the
author pulls his punches. The entire <i>&quot;I thank Heaven for a
man like Adolf Hitler&quot;</i>
flap is reduced to a footnote in fine print at the bottom of
page 187, and is introduced only as a hearsay note, that
Reinhold Niebuhr had written, in a <i>Christian Century</i> article,
about a newsman (Tom Driberg) writing about an interview with Buchman
&quot;in which the latter is reported to have said&quot;...
That was the only mention of Hitler or the Nazis that I could find
anywhere in the whole book.
While the facts given seem generally true and accurate,
and even plentiful,
I couldn't escape the feeling that a lot of negative (towards Buchman)
stuff was left out. The index actually has no entry for Adolf Hitler,
Nazism, the Nazi Party, fascism, or even Germany.
However, when former President Herbert Hoover spoke briefly and
informally at an MRA luncheon, December 10 or 11, 1938, saying that
he believed in 'ethics and morality',
we learn about that in larger type (pages 48,49).
And yes, ex-President Herbert Hoover is listed in the index,
with four entries. Hmmm...

<i>Inside Buchmanism: an independent inquiry into the Oxford Group
Movement and Moral Re-Armament</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Geoffrey Williamson<br>
Philosophical Library, New York, c1954, pubished 1955.<br>
LC: BJ10.M6W5 1955<br>
Excellent. Recommended. Good history. Extensive, fair, even-handed, and sane.
The author was right there, doing a first-hand investigation of the
Oxford Group &#8212; a.k.a. Moral Re-Armament &#8212;
in London, the country Hay's Mews center, and the Caux, Switzerland, center.
Obviously, this book only covers up to 1954, but that is the vast majority
of the Oxford Groups&#8212;MRA period.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The author gives several revealing glimpses into the cult
mind-set, like when, on page 139, he reads from the writings of
Benjamin Franklin, to some MRA members, that old Ben had advocated an
international moral organization much like MRA, and the MRA members just
gave him blank looks, and<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Much to my surprise, there was no great show of interest in this
disclosure that a great figure in American history had undoubtedly
thought of 'Moral Re-Armament' nearly two hundred years ago. Apparently
for them there was no prophet but Frank Buchman! Ben Franklin could go
hang.&quot;<br>

Very interesting. Another critical analysis of the theology of Buchman.
This author finds three flaws in Buchmanism:
<ol>
<li> It ignores the demands of the intellect in the high matter of religion.
(page 3).
<li> The Movement is too closely bound to the moods and claims of
Adolescence (page 6).
<li> The conception of Christianity which Groupism presents is far too
meagre and limited (page 10).

Quite good. It is of course biased and flavored by its time and place  &#8212;
for example, the author considers &quot;Protestantism&quot; to be a sin, something
with which I cannot quite agree  &#8212;  nevertheless, the author accurately and
perceptively analyzes and criticizes Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot;
and &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot; theology, and reveals the error and insanity
in much of Buchman's teachings.

&quot;There is some danger that the Christian conception

moral apprehension, will be degraded to a mere listening to and
recording of the vagaries of the subconscious mind.&quot;

This is the story of one of Frank Buchman's token labor leader converts,
told by a true-believer member of Moral Re-Armament. Naturally, John Riffe's
greatest accomplishment was becoming one of Frank Buchman's followers,
and getting numerous labor leaders to go to Caux-sur-Montreaux, Switzerland, or
Mackinac Island, Michigan, for Moral Re-Armament ideological training (page 140).

<i>They Have Found A Faith</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Marcus Bach<br>
The Bobs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis &amp; New York, 1946.<br>
Dewey: 289 B12<br>
This book describes eight different non-mainstream religions or cults, of which
The Oxford Group/Moral Re-Armament is one. The chapter on MRA is quite good,
quite revealing and descriptive, written by a first-hand witness who
knew his religions. Among other things, the author reveals that Frank Buchman
stole his best ideas from Henry B. Wright of Yale University, who got them
from Robert E. Speer, who got them from Henry Drummond... (page 146).
The author clearly sees that the Oxford Group is a cult religion,
and he does a good job of describing the cultish behavior that he sees.

This is a great read, the fascinating inside story of the rise of
an uncouth country bumpkin named Adolf Hitler to the leadership of
his nation... What makes it unusual is that it is an insider's story
that was written by someone who was relatively sane, and there
weren't very many of them in the inner circle of Nazis and
sycophants around Adolf. In the end, Putzi had to flee to the
USA to escape from the wrath of Hitler and the Gestapo, for
saying true and sensible things just too many times... (Or at
least, that's the way Putzi tells his story...)

The very candid story of a boy who was in elementary school when
Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, and who rose through
the ranks of the Hitlerjugend (&quot;Hitler Youth&quot;) organization
during his teenage years, attaining the rank of 
one of the top 223 Hitlerjugend area commanders by the end of World War II,
as well as becoming a skilled glider pilot who never managed to get any training
in a motorized airplane before the war ended &#8212; meaning that he never flew
a combat mission.<br>
Basically, this is the story of a boy who never really had a choice in the matter.
While this author does some real soul-searching, asking himself how much he is
responsible for what happened in World War II, and how much he was complicit in the
murder of the Jews, the truth is that this guy was just a boy doing what his elders told
him to do. And he never had anything to do with killing the Jews.<br>
This story is full of little insider details, like the one officer who told
Alfons about the war crimes and mass murder of civilians in Poland
 was executed by the Gestapo four months
before the end of the war for &quot;subverting war morale&quot;.
And at the end of the war, Alfons' last commander in the Luftwaffe saved the young lad's
life by deliberately sending him west on &quot;furlough&quot;,
putting him where he would be captured by the Americans, thus saving the young man from
being part of Hitler's insane &quot;battle to the last man and boy&quot;.
(Alas, many of his schoolmates were not so lucky. Fully half of his high school class
died before the age of 18.)<br>
An easy read; informative and entertaining.

Good, fascinating, and chilling.
Geli Raubal was both Hitler's half-neice and his only true girlfriend and lover,
She was found dead in Hitler's apartment in 1931, allegedly a suicide
at the early age of 23.
The descriptions of Hitler's sex life reveal an abused child who grew
into a really sick sado-masochistic narcissist. The author presents a
lot of evidence that supports
the distinct possibility that Geli was murdered by
the Nazis to keep her from disgracing Adolf Hitler and prematurely
ending his political career.

A very interesting biography of an amusing fraud, or a successful showman and entertainer,
depending on your viewpoint. He made quite a career of putting on faked psychic
acts, and got a fair bit of success and wealth. Unfortunately, that included
having some high-ranking Nazis owing him a lot of money,
and attracting Adolf Hitler as a believer. Some of the Gestapo found
killing Hanussen to be the easiest solution to
the problems that Hanussen created for them, so they did.

<i>The Man with the Miraculous Hands; The Fantastic Story of Felix
Kersten, Himmler's Private Doctor</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Joseph Kessel<br>
Burford Books, Short Hills, N.J., 2004.<br>
ISBN: 1-58080-122-6<br>
LC:
Dewey: B Ke47k 2004<br>
A fascinating book, very well-written. It moves you right into Heinrich Himmler's life.
Heinrich Himmler suffered from stomach pains and digestive problems that no doctor
could cure, but the alternate-medicine specialist, masseuse,
and unconventional healer Felix Kersten was able
to relieve Himmler's extreme pain, so Himmler latched onto Kersten with the
tenacity of a pit bull, and Kersten spent World War II as a practical prisoner
and slave of Himmler.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&#8212; Which actually had great benefits, because Kersten saved
a lot of lives by using his position in Himmler's household and his emotional
leverage over Himmler to the advantage
of thousands of otherwise-doomed Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Dutch underground
operatives, and other persecuted people. Kersten managed to get special powers,
privileges, and protection from Himmler because he could treat Himmler's chronic pain
like no one else could. And Kersten used that power wisely and compassionately.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Kersten literally saved thousands of lives &#8212; in one case, a whole trainload of Jews.
Kersten had extracted from Himmler a promise to spare two or three thousand Jews,
just as a favor to him, so Himmler said something like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, okay. I have this train with 2700 Jews going to Auschwitz.
That's between 2 and 3 thousand. I'll reroute it
to Switzerland. That will get Kersten off of my back.&quot;
</font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Jews who were on the train got off expecting to be in Auschwitz, getting kicked and beaten
by SS guards and shoved into the gas chambers. Instead, they found the SS troops standing at attention as the Jews
staggered across the border into Switzerland and into the arms of waiting Red Cross workers.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Kersten was amazingly bold and courageous, and took terrible risks to help friends
and allies, including acting as a courier carrying secret documents between resistance
and underground units. He would literally walk right through the Gestapo carrying such
incriminating evidence. It's quite a spy story too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At the end of the war, as Germany was collapsing, Kersten took a representative of the
World Jewish Congress into Germany to extract a promise from Himmler that the concentration camps
would not be blown up with dynamite, killing all of the Jews inside. That promise was mostly
kept.

This is the hateful anti-Semitic diatribe that the neo-Nazis love,
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Ford_Intl_Jew" target="_blank">described here</a>. It is so
extreme that it leads one to question the sanity of Henry Ford Sr..
Some of the chapters are so outrageous that they are funny:
<ul>
<li> Jewish Jazz becomes Our National Music<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Yes, everybody knows how the Jews all moved out of New York City and went to New Orleans
and took over Basin Street...</i></font>
<li> Liquor, Gambling, Vice, and Corruption.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Henry Ford Sr.<br>
The Dearborn Publishing Co., Dearborn, Mich. November, 1921.<br>
LC: DS145.D5A32 vol 3.<br>
This is the third volume of selections of Ford's anti-semitic articles
that appeared in <i>The Dearborn Independent</i>. Some of this material
also appears in the above condensation of Ford's articles. The subjects
of these chapters are similarly insane:<br>
<ul>
<li> Are the Jews Victims or Persecutors?
<li> Jewish Gamblers Corrupt American Baseball
<li> Jewish Degredation of American Baseball
<font color="blue">[Henry Ford was very upset
about &quot;the commercialization of baseball&quot;. Some star
baseball players were beginning to receive what Ford considered to be
very large salaries ($125,000 for Babe Ruth's contract was mentioned),
and Ford blamed the Jews for all of it. It is funny that the fabulously
wealthy multi-millionaire Ford felt that Babe Ruth
should work for peanuts, but that he, Henry Ford, should not.]</font>
<li> Jewish Jazz Becomes Our National Music
<li> How the Jewish Song Trust Makes You Sing
<li> Jewish Hot-Beds of Bolshevism in the U.S.
<li> Jew Trades Link With World Revolutionaries
<li> Will Jewish Zionism Bring Armageddon?
<li> How the Jews Use Power &#8212; By an Eyewitness
<li> How Jews Ruled and Ruined Tammany Hall
<li> Jew Wires Direct Tammany's Gentile Puppets
<li> Dr. Levy, a Jew, Admits His People's Error
<li> Jewish Idea Molded Federal Reserve Plan
<li> Jewish Idea of Central Bank for America
<li> How Jewish International Finance Functions
<li> Jewish Power and America's Money Famine
</ul>
The level of stereotyping and hatred is almost unbelievable. For instance,
Ford considered all of the Jewish garment makers to be Bolsheviks:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
'Why the tendency of the Jew to the &quot;needle trades&quot;?
It is explained in his aversion to manual labor, his abhorrence of agricultural
life, and his desire to arrange his own affairs.'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 91, <i>Jewish Hot-Beds of Bolshevism in the U.S.</i>)</font>
<br>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...the &quot;needle trades&quot; being exclusively Jewish, all their abuses
are Jewish too. ... Bolshevism is not Russian but Jewish...
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 92, <i>Jewish Hot-Beds of Bolshevism in the U.S.</i>)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But in other chapters, Ford says that the Jews are controlling international
banking and finance, not the garment industry. And I never noticed Henry Ford
taking to the agricultural life either, out plowing the south forty behind his mule.
And Ford sure insisted on arranging his own affairs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Why did a man of such wealth
and power spend so much time, money, and energy attacking people who had apparently
done nothing to him, and whose alleged world-wide conspiracies had not stopped Henry
Ford from becoming as wealthy as King Midas?
I have to seriously question Henry Ford Sr.'s sanity.

Father Caughlin was a stereotypical rabid right-winger, raving about &quot;The Jewish

<li> Glittering Generality &#8212; create over-generalized positive images and stereotypes
<li> Transfer (also known as Association) &#8212; gaining respectability or admiration

<li> Testimonial &#8212; people tell stories that praise the propagandist's favorite cause 
<li> Plain Folks &#8212; it's just us regular plain good-old-boys; nothing to get upset about
<li> Card Stacking &#8212; also called Monopolistic Card Stacking &#8212; it's stacking
the odds in your favor by carefully arranging the &quot;facts&quot; while

LC: CT788 M564P79 1977<br>
An excellent biography of Unity Mitford, the frivolous mad-cap aristocratic
blond English girl who enjoyed hanging out with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, and she
was the sister of Diana Mitford, who first married Bryan Guinness, of the
famous Guinness brewing family, and then dropped him for Sir Oswald Mosley,
who became the leader of the British Union of Fascists.<br>
The above two books are nearly identical, other than the photographs,
where some were cropped or had text inset in the New York reprint.
The text of the two books is
identical, but laid out differently, printed in different fonts and sizes,
which results in very different page numbers for quotes.<br>
Of particular interest here is the description of Dr. Frank Buchman attending
the 1935 Nuremberg Nazi Party rally, and sitting with the Mitford sisters,
Unity Mitford and Lady Diana Mosley, in the <i>Ehreng&auml;ste</i> (Honored Guests)
section of the stands, behind Adolf Hitler.<br>

Interesting, another good slant on the minds and thinking of cults
and cult-like organizations, including Hitler and his Nazis.
This book has a strongly scientific and psychological slant to it
(which is good; too many books just sensationalize cults).

A well-written and very interesting overview of quite a number of cults.
Easy reading and entertaining.
Balanced and well-thought-out, too. The author was a staff member of
<i>Newsweek</i> magazine who spent years investigating secret cults for
this book.
Because of its publication date, 1960, it obviously does not cover those
cults that became popular in the sixties and seventies, but it does do a
good job of covering all of the better-known cults in the century from
1850 to 1950, including the cults that developed into mainstream religions,
and then the California cults, the sex cults, the Black cults, and the
odd-balls like the UFO cults, the vegetarians, yogis, and Zen and Beatniks.

<i>Snapping: America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change</i>

ISBN: 0-397-01258-6<br>
LC: 698.2.C66<br>
LCCN: 78-6627<br>
Dewey: 155.25 C767s<br>
Interesting, and makes some good points. The authors concentrate on the psychological
phenomenon of &quot;snapping&quot; &#8212; sudden, dramatic personality changes accompanied
by hallucinatory or unreal or otherworldly experiences and feelings, which
are often called &quot;religious experiences&quot; (like Bill Wilson called his).
The authors build up a theoretical foundation for the phenomenon, and then
they do a good job of exploring how a variety of cults induce and use snapping
experiences to convert people into true believer cult members.
They also describe the array of mind-control techniques used on the
victims of Scientology, the Moonies' Unification Church,
the Love Family, Transcendental Meditation,
the Hari Krishnas, Charles Manson, and
the Symbionese Liberation Army (who kidnapped and converted Patricia Hearst),
to induce such conversion experiences. Unfortunately, the authors deal with
this &quot;snapping&quot; phenomenon in a very inconsistent way &#8212;
they regard it as bad when
a cult uses snapping to flip somebody out and make him into a cult member, but
they praise the use of the technique when a deprogrammer uses it to
&quot;deprogram&quot; a cult member and &quot;snap&quot; a cult member
&quot;out of it&quot;
(and convert the young person into whatever the paying parents wish...)<br>
<a name="Ted_Patrick"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I have a major disagreement with the authors over their praise of
Ted Patrick (&quot;Black Lightning&quot;) the deprogrammer,
whose methods were brutal and sadistic, and who was, in my opinion, just
a vicious brainwasher for hire, someone who was hired by the parents of
young cult members to reverse program their kids' minds.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The authors praised Patrick as the only man with a working system to
deprogram cult members, which was simply not true at all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They reported that Patrick would do things like cut the
ponytails off of Hari Krishna members, an assault on their persons that
served no purpose but to torment and humiliate Patrick's victims, but the authors
rationalized such behavior by saying that the victim's parents had
given their permission for Patrick to do it. (As if the parents had such
a right.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;On occasion, Patrick told us, he may thrust a battling cult member
into a chair or against a wall, not to harm the individual, he insisted,
but simply to demonstrate his capacity to match his opponent's strength
and determination. During deprogramming, however, Patrick has no qualms
about employing a variety of shock tactics designed to jar his subjects
out of their otherwise impenetrable bliss&quot;</font>
See page 66.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So the authors glossed over Patrick's violent abuse of his subjects (but
the courts did not).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The authors were basically blind to Patrick's real methods. They wrote:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;As far as we could see, Patrick's clients showed no scars, either physical
or mental, from their deprogramming experience. Almost without exception,
they seemed to be healthy, happy, fully rehabilitated, and completely free
of the effects of cult life.&quot;</font> (See page 69.)<br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(<i>Fully rehabilitated</i>? That is quite a euphemism.)<br>
</font>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="#EHCA" target="_blank">What studies have been done of Ted Patrick's work</a> have
shown that he left his victims in an even more traumatized and mentally-damaged state
than the cults did. Far too many of his subjects were left
traumatized, numb, and in shock, with bad cases of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder),
sometimes for months or years, like one victim who spent the next year
just staring out of her bedroom window after Ted Patrick brutally &quot;fixed&quot; her mind.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Experience has shown that the best way to deprogram cult members is to let
them come out of it themselves, which they almost always eventually do.
Now that the cult scare is over, and we have had 30 years to see what happens with
cults, we can see that most all of the cults suffered from very high drop-out
rates. Eventually, the kids do learn that the phony guru really is a phony and
a criminal, and become disillusioned with him all on their own, without having
a brutal drill sergeant to torture and &quot;deprogram&quot; them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I cannot overlook the fact that Ted Patrick was a big black guy who seems to
have thoroughly enjoyed beating up on wimpy white kids, and he even got paid
by their stupid parents for doing it. He was just another con man, and a very cruel
one at that.
Ted Patrick got out of the deprogramming business when the criminal charges of
kidnapping, false imprisonment, and assault piled up, and
he started serving hard time in prison,
and he also started losing large civil lawsuits filed by his victims, as well.<br>
Eventually, Ted Patrick was convicted on felony charges of kidnapping and unlawful
imprisonment, and sentenced to a year in prison.
See the Wikipedia web page on Ted Patrick, here:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160813141936/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Patrick" target="_blank">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Patrick</a>
<br>
And note that Wikipedia does not allow really harsh or vicious attacks on people
&#8212; they call that an &quot;attack page&quot; and delete it.  One of the editors
of the Wiki page on Ted Patrick said this on the &quot;talk page&quot; about the
Ted Patrick page:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The truth is that this guy is an intellectually deficient, morally corrupt, speech
impedimented organized crime boss who preyed on the fears and wallets of scared
families. People would literally mortgage their houses to pay exorbitant fees to
Patrick and other blood suckers like him. I personally know two people that had
large amounts of money stolen (each) by these vampires (not Patrick in those cases).
I also personally know someone who was "deprogrammed" by Teddy himself, and was
force fed meat and was aggressively sexually "enticed" by a prostitute hired by
Patrick for that purpose. The deprogramming was unsuccessful.
<p>
But we can't say all that on Wikipedia. My &quot;dim-witted, inarticulate wack
job&quot; comment was quite mild.

Unfortunately, she just gives deprogrammers like

a quick nod of approval, without mentioning the negative side
of deprogramming, which is that too many deprogrammers
are nothing but vicious bullies who practice &quot;brainwashing for
the other side&quot; &#8212; just grab the kids, and brainwash them
into believing whatever the paying parents want them to believe,
instead of what the cult has brainwashed them into believing.
That can cause a lot of psychological damage.

This is the story of another phony guru, Paul Brunton.
The viewpoint of the author is unusual: Jeffrey Masson was a child in
the Masson household while the &quot;guru&quot; lived with and free-loaded
on the Masson family.
In other words, Brunton was the guru of Jeffrey Masson's father.
Young Jeffrey was also the spiritual heir apparent of the guru,
but Jeffrey decided that Brunton was a fake, and decided not to
follow in the &quot;guru's&quot; footsteps.

Excellent. Recommended. Exposes the sordid, unethical roots of psychotherapy.
Masson makes it clear that in his opinion, the scandals that he exposes are not
just flukes or exceptional cases, but rather that psychotherapy is inherently
corrupt.
After describing the horrendous physical, psychological and sexual abuse to
which a Dr. Rosen subjected his patients, Masson asked,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The point of this book is to raise precisely this question: Is Rosen an exception,
or is there something about psychotherapy, something in the very nature of
psychotherapy, that tends toward such abuses? Are these abuses or simply the
use that is made of psychotherapy? A prison warden, a slaveholder, and a
psychotherapist have in common the desire to control another person. (The
analogy may appear inexact, for the person in therapy, many believe, is free
to leave or quit. I don't believe this is true, though it would require a
discussion of the concept of &quot;informed consent.&quot; Nevertheless,
the parallels are striking. We know for a fact that many slaveholders thought
of themselves as kindly and argued that slaves were lucky to have them
as masters, for others would be worse. Medical doctors at Auschwitz argued
that if they didn't do what they did, others would do it more brutally.
People who participate in causing suffering to others often employ this argument.)<br>

This book is very good. It gives lots of good general background
information on cults, and particularly exposes, in the chapter
&quot;Intruding into the Workplace&quot;,
how some cults have insinuated themselves into the very fabric
of our society, like how Werner Erhard's
<b><i>est</i></b> hoax morphed into The Landmark Forum (and similar
organizations) and sold &quot;motivation enhancement seminars&quot;
to corporate America.<br>

<font color="blue">
(I wish she had paid a lot more attention to the grandchildren of
Synanon, the abusive &quot;confrontational attack therapy&quot;
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation programs like <i>The Seed</i> and
<i>Straight, Inc.</i>, and
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">the children's boot camps</a> today,
and how they have insinuated
themselves into the fabric of our society, and pass off their
fascist torture of children as beneficial to America...)
</font>
<p>
I just have one bone to pick with her. She says on page 97 that
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a cult, because
<ul>
<li> A.A. does not
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">recruit deceptively</a>.
<li> A.A. does not
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">hide what membership eventually
will entail</a>.
(<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#ftnt03_ret" target="_blank">Also, see &quot;Teaspoons, Not Buckets&quot;.</a>)
<li> Members can
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_exit" target="_blank">leave at any point</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">A.A. focuses on helping
people grow</a>, while cults use their members to
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">promote the growth of the cult</a>
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">increase the cult
leader's power and wealth</a>.
</ul>
Unfortunately, she got every single one of those points wrong.
A.A. is guilty of every single one of those cult characteristics,
and many more.
<p>
In addition, in her earlier book, <i>&quot;Crazy Therapies&quot;</i>, which
criticized various fad therapies of the nineteen-sixties through the
-eighties, she warned of some common characteristics of fraudulent treatments:
<ul>
<li> <i>The &quot;Procrustean Bed&quot; &#8212; an all-purpose diagnosis that
can be stretched to fit any problem.</i>
That's A.A. and its Twelve Steps, which are
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">the snake-oil that will cure anything</a>.
<li> <i>&quot;Unrealistic Expectations&quot;.</i>  That's A.A. again, which
teaches that a 12-Step panacea &#8212; listing and confessing your sins,
and feeling powerless and guilty about everything &#8212;
will fix alcoholism, keep you from drinking, remove all of your sins,
and give you Sobriety, Recovery, Serenity, Gratitude, and even
&quot;Spirituality&quot;.
Also see
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises" target="_blank">The Promises</a>
for more unrealistic expectations.

<li> <i>&quot;Unexplained Workings&quot; &#8212; the promoter cannot explain the
theoretical basis of the treatment or its purported successes.</i>
That's A.A. yet again. There is no medical or scientific explanation for
how the 12 steps are supposed to cure or treat alcoholism, or make alcoholics
stop drinking. It's all vague hand-waving and claims that
God will really like you and you will become &quot;spiritual&quot;
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#two_stepper" target="_blank">
if you do Bill Wilson's 12 steps</a>, so then God will do a bunch of

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Frequently, at gatherings of former cult members, a lively exchange
takes place when participants compare their respective groups and
leaders. As people begin to describe their special, enlightened,
and unique leader &#8212; whether a pastor, therapist, political leader,
teacher, lover, or swami &#8212; those present are often surprised to learn
that their once-revered leaders are actually quite similar in
temperament and personality. It seems as if those leaders come from
a common mold, sometimes light-heartedly called the
&quot;Cookie-Cutter Messiah School.&quot;<br>

<i>The Wrong Way Home, Uncovering the Patterns of
Cult Behavior in American Society</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Arthur J. Deikman, M.D.<br>
Beacon Press, Boston, MA, 1990.<br>
ISBN: 0-8070-2914-9<br>
LC: BL2525.D55 1990<br>
Dewey: 302.3&#8212;dc20 or 302.3 D327w<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Fascinating. Recommended. Exposes how cult-like behavior and attitudes
permeate a lot of our institutions, including our churches, corporations,
and government.
Dr. Deikman was on a Congressional committee that studied cults after
the Jonestown mass suicide and the murder of Congressman Leo J. Ryan,
and one of the disturbing facts that he noticed was: The question of
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">whether any particular group is a cult</a>
is not a black-or-white, yes-or-no, question. It's all shades of gray,
and many of our organizations, institutions, and government agencies
exhibit cultish behavior to some extent or other.
This book is useful on two levels: First, it describes
cults and cultish behavior in a clear and concise way. And secondly,
it finds that cultish behavior, to varying degrees, in many of our
common institutions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Deikman saw cults as pushing extreme degrees of these four behaviors:<br>
<ul>
<li>
Compliance with the group,
<li>
Dependence on a leader,
<li>
Devaluing the outsider, and
<li>
Avoiding dissent.
</ul>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And then he also found those behaviors contributing to
government disasters like Kennedy's Bay of Pigs and Reagan's Iran-Contra
conspiracy, which has very disturbing implications, because you feel like
it can happen again next week, because the politicians are still doing the
same stupid things, again and again.<br>
<font color="blue">
And since I wrote that, it did happen again. Both the Kennedy and Bush
White House administrations were cursed with a bunch of optimistic cheer-leaders who
could see no possible reasons why an invasion might fail &#8212; no matter whether it was
invading Cuba or invading Afghanistan and Iraq. And nobody was inviting
dissenters into the administration, either.

was a lunatic who foisted pseudo-science on the world,
as well as being a fascist, a racist, and a Nazi sympathizer.<br>

This book is indeed encyclopedic in organization, but not in size.
See <i>The New Believers</i> by David Barrett for a real encyclopedia.
Still, it covers a dozen old, established cults, and 15 new ones.
And the chapter on the anti-cult movement is good. Most authors miss
the fact that the &quot;anti-cult movement&quot;, as exemplified
by Ted Patrick &#8212; the &quot;Black Lightning&quot; deprogrammer &#8212;
and his assistants, was just another vicious, coercive
brainwashing cult, too. Patrick just brainwashed kids &quot;the other
way&quot;, for the paying parents... That has pretty much ended, due
to lawsuits and criminal kidnapping charges.

Dewey: 291.0973 M383k or (sugg.) 291.9<br>
This is an encyclopedia of cults from a Christian believer's point
of view.
(Of course the 1965 edition does not cover the new cults that started up in the
late 1960s and early 1970s. The 1985 edition does cover many of them.)
Much of the criticism of cults is based on how they depart
from standard Christian theology. For example, the author faults
Transcendental Meditation like this:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>Jesus Christ</i>. TM ignores Jesus Christ almost totally, although
Maharishi teaches that anyone can become as enlightened as Jesus Christ
through the application of TM techniques. It is clear from his neglect
of Jesus Christ and from his world view that he does not consider
Jesus Christ to be the unique Son of God, God manifest in the flesh.<br>

The physiology chapter is particularly interesting, if you happen to

considering the publication date and the rapid accumulation of
scientific data these days. But it is still good stuff.

A very small book (86 pages) that contains a
lot of good, common-sense advice on how to deal with cults and a loved one who has
joined one. Basically adopts a tolerant, 'let them work it out' attitude.
The authors recognize the fact that most bad cults suffer from very high drop-out rates
without any outside help. Most cult members eventually wise up and vote with their feet &#8212;
they walk out.
Some of the best advice: &quot;Never pay money to anyone to get a loved one out of a cult. Kidnapping
is a felony. Never pay for deprogramming. You won't find anyone who isn't a criminal
who will do a deprogramming today.&quot; (Pages 43-45.)

This is the story of a young woman who escaped from the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints,
the cult of Warren Jeffs,
and then devoted her life to rescuing other girls.
The FLDS believes in polygamy, and they routinely rape underage girls,
forcing them into marriages with old men, where the girls may be the fourth
 or sixth wife of some church elder.
This book presents a great example of an extreme cult.
The cult teachings border on the unbelievable: &quot;Women are not allowed to have lawyers.&quot;
&quot;Women are not allowed to disobey men, who are all members of the priesthood.&quot;
The teachings on sex were: &quot;Sex is for procreation only. If she is enjoying the sex, you aren't doing it right.&quot;
Eventually, the leader of the cult, Warren Jeffs, was convicted of aiding and abetting rape, and will
probably spend the rest of his life in jail.
The cult, however, is still doing just fine. They are now solidly established in Utah, Arizona, Texas,
and Canada.

<br>
<i>Fake It Til You Make It!</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Phil Kerns<br>
Victory Press, Carlton, Oregon 97111, 1982.<br>
ISBN: 0-9609908-0-1<br>
LC: HD9999.S742K4 1982<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An interesting expos&eacute; of Amway as a commercial cult, coming from
a Christian viewpoint. The author calls Amway a modern Baal.
(The author is himself a very interesting person &#8212; he survived Jim Jones'
People's Temple cult, although some of his other family members did not &#8212; and he wrote
a book about that too, <i>&quot;People's Temple, People's Tomb&quot;</i>.)<br>
The title of this book &#8212; &quot;<i>Fake It Til You Make It!</i>&quot; &#8212;
is an Amway slogan. It is also a common Alcoholics Anonymous slogan, which is not a coincidence.
Both cults exhort people to pretend that they are successful when they are not,
and &quot;act as if&quot; the cult's program is working great,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#act_as_if" target="_blank">in order to deceive the newcomers
and make them believe that the program is really working for everybody
who works the program</a>.
Such behavior also helps to retain the current members who are wavering and
thinking of leaving the organization.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Kerns shows that the average Amway distributor actually <i>loses</i> a few
hundred dollars per year by working as a distributor. The average distributor
makes several hundred dollars per year in commissions from selling soap and
other Amway products, but he spends more than that on &quot;motivational&quot; books,
tapes, rally tickets and other such &quot;sales tools&quot;. (Which is easy to
do at $280 per ticket and $70 for a set of tapes, and then there are incidental expenses
like travel, lodging, and food.) (Page 117.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Kerns also criticized the cultish behavior that he saw: blind obedience of
upline leaders' orders,
demands for total commitment, suppression of dissent, devaluing the outsider,
obsession with 'the program',
hyper-emotionalism, brainwashing/mind-control techniques used,
and grossly distorting Biblical teachings to make it sound like Amway
is a Christian organization.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Kerns also does the math and shows how it is impossible for the majority of the rank
and file Amway distributors to get rich: Amway's total profits in 1982
were estimated to be $350 million. But there were one million Amway
distributors that year. Even if Amway Corporation were to distribute
<i>ALL</i> of its profits to the distributors and keep nothing for itself
(unlikely), that would still only give the distributors $350 each.
Or Amway could manufacture 350 new millionaires and give nothing to
the other 999,650 distributors. (Pages 112-114.) But no way can everybody
get rich, no matter how hard they &quot;work the program&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In addition, the largest amount that any Amway distributor ever made in one year
was $416,000.
But at Amway distributors' rallies, top distributors were declared to
be making fantastic amounts of money, like $70 million per year.
How could that be? Easy. By selling large quantities of motivational
books, tapes, and rally tickets
to the rank and file Amway distributors all over the country. (Page 85.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Easy, good reading.<br>

<i>Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Bart D. Ehrman<br>

ISBN:	0060738170 (cloth)<br>
ISBN:	9780060738174<br>
LCCN:	 2005046326<br>
This is not a book about a cult. It is, rather, a scholarly study
of how the Christian Bible
was written, and rewritten, and changed, over the years, and who did it.
The author is far from a skeptic; he is a professor of theology,
and Chairman of the Department of Religious Studies at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in the heart of the Bible Belt.
He is one of those rare souls who knows the truth about the Bible and
early Christianity, and who will tell the truth &#8212;
and without grinding an ax for some particular sect, or coming off as a fundamentalist.
<br>
The author reveals some stunning facts, like that there are so many
variations and differences in the existing historical fragments of the Bible
that there are actually more possible versions of the Bible than there
are words in the Bible.
<br>
This book is thus very impressive, and important to anyone wanting to
know the truth about a lot of erroneous doctrines. What is especially
appalling is how many Bible-beating fundamentalist churches pick out
a few lines of the Bible and emphasize them and base their entire theology on
their interpretation of those lines,
when in fact the lines are erroneous, or fraudulent inserts or changes, done by some
well-meaning fool who thought that he would &quot;correct errors&quot; and fix things.
<br>
Strongly recommended for anyone who wants a better understanding of the
history of the Bible, or who wants to know what the Bible really says, or did once
say.

<h2>Synanon:</h2>
<p><br>
<i>Escape From Utopia: My Ten Years in Synanon</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; William F. Olin<br>
Unity Press, Santa Clara, CA, 1980.<br>
ISBN: 0-913-30053-5<br>
Dewey: 362.293 O46e<br>
 &#8212; This is the story of Synanon, as it degenerated from a utopian
social organization and also a successful drug and alcohol
rehabilitation program, into a vicious nightmarish cult, ending
with the arrest of the cult's leader Charles &quot;Chuck&quot;
Dederich on charges of conspiracy to commit murder.<br>

This story is especially good because it is told by a man who was
an idealist, a successful architect seeking a utopia, one of the
&quot;life-stylers&quot; who joined Synanon purely out of choice, rather
than one of the addicts desperately fleeing from death by drugs.
It gives his story a certain credibility,
and it also means that it is the story of a life gradually going
down-hill towards Hell over a ten-year period, as the organization
gradually turned into a really bad cult, rather than the story of
someone coming up from the bottom. Where some of the ex-addicts
might have seen even the worst parts of Synanon as improvements
in their lives, Olin didn't. He had a good bit more perspective on
things than that.<br>

<i>The Tunnel Back, Synanon</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Lewis Yablonsky<br>
The Macmillan Company, New York, 1965.<br>
LCC 65-10664<br>
Dewey: 362.29 Y12t<br>
This is an earlier book about Synanon, from a very positive viewpoint.
This book ended before Synanon went really crazy, so it has nothing
but good things to say about Synanon and Chuck Dederich.<br>

Actually, that is a gross understatement. Yablonsky is a fawning
hero-worshipper, and acts like a starry-eyed teenage girl adoring
a rock star. Yablonsky hangs on &quot;Chuck&quot; Dederich's every
bombastic declaration as the ultimate in human wisdom.
The U.C.L.A. sociologist Dr. Lewis Yablonsky was one of those
people who came to investigate Synanon, and got completely converted to
believing in the cult, much
like <a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a> when he
saw Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>

It is interesting to read this book second, and Olin's book listed
above first,
and note the contrasts, and know what the things that started in
this book
led to in Olin's story, like how the much-praised &quot;tough love&quot;
treatment of
newcomers and non-conforming members described in this book eventually
led to the brutal beatings of members and their children by the
&quot;Imperial Marines&quot; goon squad later.<br>

It is especially interesting to see how this author exposes the growing
cultishness of Synanon without even realizing it.
<i>Many</i> of the standard cult characteristics are there:
<ul>
<li> grovelling worship of the leader Chuck Dederich, he's always right
and <i>&quot;you are always wrong&quot;</i>,
<li> mentoring &#8212; which means that the more senior members
&quot;guide&quot; the newcomers &#8212; which
really means the senior members constantly berate and attack
the newcomers, and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Yablonsky_gush" target="_blank">
Yablonsky has high praise</a> for all of the creative
and clever ways in which the old-timers brutally verbally assaulted
the newcomers,
<li> and &quot;newcomers can't think right&quot; because they are
just addicts,
<li> Sacred Science &#8212; <i>&quot;Chuck Dederich has discovered a
great new social organization&quot;</i>,<br>

And:<br>

&quot;The development which takes place is best described as
a 'resocialization process.' The individual is, in a fashion,
'brainwashed' to give up his old deviant patterns.&quot;<br>

&#8212; Yablonsky commenting on the process of attacking old patterns
in a 'synanon' a.k.a. a &quot;confrontational-type&quot; therapeutic
community. From <i>The Tunnel Back</i>, page 261.

<li> We are special,
<li> Arrogant, bombastic existence: We are going to transform the
world because we are smarter than everybody else who has ever tried to
solve these problems...
<li> and more...
</ul>
<p>

One example is on page 397, talking about
why the leader Chuck Dederich didn't like professional evaluations of
Synanon as a drug rehab program:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another factor that would tend to invalidate standard research practice
for Synanon is that unless the researcher understood the <i>new</i> social
organization called Synanon, he would be inclined to project onto it
concepts that apply to the traditional institutions.
Since Synanon is not a prison, a &quot;halfway house,&quot; a hospital, or
A.A., it would be inappropriate to evaluate it by many of the
traditional research methods.
</font>
</blockquote>
 &#8212; Which means,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Our cult is special, so special that psychologists
studying us won't even be able to understand how special we are.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Besides, a properly-trained, experienced, professional psychologist
might have recognized that the wonderful &quot;<i>new</i>
social organization&quot; was
really just standard <i>old</i> cult organization in new clothes.<br>
<p>
The book arrogantly ends with:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The belief of some professionals in their <i>exclusive right</i> to treat human
problems is no longer logical or practical in the light of Synanon's success.
Greater cooperation between the professionals and the Synanon community
of &quot;professionals&quot; seems clearly needed.
A first step in this potentially productive cooperation would be for the orthodox
professional and the public to understand Synanon, not as an extension of
older institutional models, but as a new therapeutic system with a viable
structure and integrity of its own. From this more logical starting point,
the public and the professional community, in cooperation with Synanon, can
forward the natural thrust of this vital new <i>social movement.</i>

Alas, would that it were so. Note that Yablonsky's book has
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_dogma" target="_blank"><i>Sacred Science</i></a>
written all over it. Cults are as old as the hills, and yet, many
of them claim to be the very first people on Earth to discover some
great new principle or invention, or the first to receive some great
new revelation from God. In the end, Synanon was just one more cult,
unfortunately.

<i>The Light on Synanon: How a Country Weekly Exposed a Corporate
Cult &#8212; And Won the Pulitzer Prize</i>

Seaview Books, New York, 1980.<br>
ISBN: 0-87223-613-7<br>
Dewey: 071.947 M681L<br>
Fascinating, easy reading. This is the story of how a little weekly
newspaper, run by the Mitchell husband-and-wife team,
and the U.C. Berkeley professor Richard Ofshe, managed to
bring down the Synanon cult and
win the Pulitzer prize in the process.
What is really disturbing is how reluctant the California officials
were to actually enforce the laws. For years, their attitude was,
&quot;Well okay, we'll file a report. But we can't press charges, or
get a conviction, because it's just your word against theirs, and
they have a thousand people, and 40 lawyers...&quot;
The authorities didn't raid Synanon, or make any arrests,
until after Jim Jones' cult (also from northern California)
committed mass suicide in Guyana.
Only then did the authorities get scared and do something.

University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL, 1997.<br>

This is the story of one survivor of the Hari Krishna cult, ISKCON.<br>
What is especially curious about this book is that the authoress still
has not discarded her belief in the founder, A.C. Bhaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada.
She just thinks that his followers destroyed the church after his death,
and that he wasn't aware of things like the child abuse and unethical
fund-raising that went on while he was alive.<br>

She wrote a whole book documenting the evils of the organization,
and the gross misconduct and crimes of Prabhupada's disciples &#8212; the
dishonest fund-raising, the drug dealing, the guns, and the murder
of a critic &#8212; and she just
did not seem to be capable of waking up and realizing who trained
those disgusting junior &quot;zone gurus&quot;,
and made them into the despicable creeps that they really are.<br>

<i>The Scandal of Scientology</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Paulette Cooper<br>
Tower Publications, Inc., New York, 1971.<br>
LC: BP605.S2 C661 1971<br>
Very good. Required reading for the sincere student of cults or Scientology.
This book was the first important, thorough expos&eacute; of Scientology,
and the Scientology organization was vicious in its response.
They actually planted a boyfriend/lover in her life, a man who pretended
to be her friend, a man with whom she shared all of the intimate secrets
of her life, as well as her bed.
Little did she know that he was xeroxing off her personal
diaries and reporting everything about her to the Scientology headquarters.
Then, an agent for Scientology stole pages of her personal stationery
that she had touched and which bore her fingerprints, and then the
Scientologists typed fake bomb threats against Scientology on the paper,
and charged Paulette Cooper with threatening Scientology. Ms. Cooper
was arrested and indicted. Fortunately for her, the FBI discovered
that Scientologists were burglarizing U.S. Government offices and
stealing files on thousands of people, so the FBI raided the
Scientology headquarters in several cities. When they did, they
found plenty of evidence that the whole case against Ms. Cooper was
a total fraud and a complete frame-up.
But the Scientologists still didn't stop. Ms. Cooper reported that
even five years later, they began out sending pages of her teenage
diaries to various people, anonymously.

Also excellent. This book's particular claim to fame is that L. Ron Hubbard's own
son, who defected from Scientology, is a co-author.
Well-researched and well-documented. It is obvious that the younger Hubbard had
access to materials no one else could get, and he also knew things that outsiders
did not. One chapter explores the older Hubbard's dabbling in the magic of Aleister
Crowley, and another is &quot;Freaking Out on Paulette&quot;, which describes the reaction
of Hubbard and Scientology to the book that Paulette Cooper wrote.

Quite good. Rather than just sensationalizing the Moonies, or
grandly proclaiming that cults can brainwash people in a few days,
like some extremist anti-cult people and professional
&quot;deprogrammers&quot; do, the author really delves into
how the recruiting and indoctrination mind games work, and how much the
victim cooperates with the program (or doesn't cooperate).
The author also reveals things like that
the actual recruiters' success rate is about 0.005% (page 147).
The author even gets into psychoanalyzing the members, revealing that
many of them had mental problems before joining the Moonies, and
suggesting that that was why they joined.
This book is a breath of sanity in a field that needs more.

ISBN: 0-894-79046-3<br>
LC: BP605.P46M54<br>
This book is sickening. It is very good, but it is still sickening.
This book borders on the unbelievable &#8212; the depths of Jim Jones' depravity and evil
are almost unimagineable.

The continuous lies, vicious hatred, terrorism, physical and mental torture that
Jones inflicted on his followers was so sickening that I didn't actually
finish reading the whole book. I had to stop.
And it is mind-boggling how many followers stayed for more abuse.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Jeanne Mills, her husband, and their young daughter were all
murdered in their home in Berkeley, California, in March of 1980, by People's Temple
cult members, just months after she published this book exposing
the inner workings of the cult.
That happened shortly after the mass suicide in Guyana, and the murders were apparently
done by a few surviving members of the Temple goon squad,
&quot;The Angels&quot;, who then committed suicide.

Her brother Larry was part of the assassination team that killed
Congressman Leo J. Ryan and the others at the landing strip in Guyana.
I hear that he's now doing life in a Federal penitentiary.
Deborah was smart enough to get out earlier, so she was left alive to

Red Robin Press, New York, 1998.<br>
ISBN: 1-55212-207-7<br>
Dewey: 289.9 K12s<br>
This book is <i>very</i> pro-Jim-Jones. It is a disorganized mess
of scraps of information mixed with conspiracy theories. It is a
frightening example of the mind of a <i>true believer</i>, someone
who believes in the Big Lie so intensely that not even the deaths
of 914 innocent people will make the author see that Jones
was evil. The author still maintains that Jones was a saint.
The author chooses to believe that it was all a big plot by the CIA,
and Jonestown was a paradise, and &quot;a peaceful community was
targeted for destruction&quot; because the U.S. Government didn't
like Jim Jones' radical left-wing politics. The author just will
not face one simple fact: It was Jim Jones, and not the CIA or the
U.S. Government, who ordered 914 men, women, children and babies to
drink cyanide kool-aid.

Dewey: 988.103 L266s<br>
This is another apology for Jim Jones. Mark Lane is the same
author as the one who gained some fame for Kennedy assassination
conspiracy theories. (Alas, my opinion of those theories just
went down a notch, because if Lane is representative of the lot,
then there isn't much there.)
Lane was hired as a publicist for Jim Jones' People's Temple
in the last days of the cult, and Lane is still doing his job.
Lane, like the previous author,
blames the U.S. government for bothering Jim Jones and pushing
him over the edge, and making him order his followers to drink
cyanide. To Mark Lane, the &quot;strongest poison&quot; was not
the cyanide that Jim Jones ordered fed to the children,
it was the U.S. government saying nasty things about Jim
Jones. Pathetic, really pathetic.
I guess some people will do anything to sell a book.<br>
On the bright side, the book is voluminous, and will give you
Jim Jones' arguments, rationalizations, and excuses on every issue.

This is a book from what I call a &quot;spiritual Pollyanna&quot;. Such Pollyannas are people
who mindlessly jabber things like, &quot;Oh isn't is so wonderful that these wonderful gurus come
from India to teach us all such wonderful things?&quot; The author was incapable of
recognizing a con artist at work. He raved about how they brought us
 &quot;a new consciousness&quot;.
<br>
I can't say anthing about Sai Baba one way or the other, but the &quot;wonderful&quot; teachings
of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh were a total con that ended with his followers at Antelope Valley, Oregon,
waging germ warfare against the local residents, trying to make them too sick to vote,
to that Rajneesh could take over the county,
and Rajneesh fled the country to avoid being put in prison.<br>
And Muktananda set up a commune where he specialized in
using his yogic powers to screw all of the 14-year-old girls for an hour each.
Afterwards, he would hold up one finger to the girl and say, &quot;Remember. One hour.&quot;
<br>
The moral of the story is, for every real teacher who came over from the East, ten phonies came
over to cash in.

<h2>David Berg and The Children of God cult:</h2>

<i>The Children of God: The Inside Story; by the daughter of the
Founder Moses David Berg</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;

The Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Missouri: 1984.<br>
ISBN: 0-310-27840-6<br>
Dewey: 289.9 D261c<br>
This is an insider account of David Berg's <i>Children of God</i> cult &#8212;
a <i>very insider</i> account, because it was written by David Berg's
daughter. She says straight out front that he was a criminal and a
monster. His idea of &quot;true spiritual freedom&quot; and
&quot;perfect love&quot;, for instance,
was that all of the women, including his daughter,
should freely have sex with him. (Pages 9-12 and 99-101.)
And more: all of the women must practice <i>Flirty Fishing</i>,
prostitution to bring in more members and money, and their husbands
should work as their pimps... Unbelievable, but true.
Needless to say, fascinating.

Enterprise Publishing, Wilmington, DE, 1991.<br>
ISBN: 0-942103-23-8<br>
Dewey: 132 J34n<br>
Back in the late 'sixties, Janov published his original
<i>Primal Scream</i>, which featured patients saying things like,
&quot;Well, if I add up how much money I spend on cigarettes over
a period of several years, it is many thousands of dollars.
But if I give $5000 of it to Arthur instead, for him to teach me
how to scream and quit smoking,
I'll be so much healthier, and I'll actually save money.
So that's what I'll do &#8212; I'll give Dr. Janov $5000.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Well, Janov managed to polish his act a little in the following
20 years, but it's still the same old garbage. Now the back cover of this
book says,<br>
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;Scientific Research World-Wide Proves Primal

<i>Brainwashing, From Pavlov to Powers</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Edward Hunter<br>
Originally published by Farrar, Straus, &amp; Cudahy, Inc., 1951, 1956.<br>

1958, 1965.<br>
LC: 56-7817 and 60-53397<br>
Dewey: 131.33 H91<br>
This book is very good. It is a classic.
And the book is fascinating and a good read.
It really gives you the feeling of being there and going through
the brainwashing to which the American, British, and other United
Nations soldiers were subjected during the Korean War.
It also clearly explains just how the brainwashing worked and how
some men succumbed to it, and some successfully resisted it.
It also turns out that this was the first book on Communist
brainwashing published, and Hunter was actually the author
who coined the term &quot;brainwashing&quot; &#8212; it's just a
translation of the Chinese phrase <i>Hsi Nao</i>, which
Mao Tse Tung (aka Mao Zhe Dhong) and
gang used to denote the idea of washing away the vestiges of
the old system (literally &quot;cleansing the mind&quot;) in the
process of being re-educated to assume one's place in the new
Communist society.

<i>Coercive Persuasion: A Socio-psychological
Analysis of the &quot;Brainwashing&quot; of American Civilian
Prisoners by the Chinese Communists</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Edgar H. Schein with
Inge Schneier and Curtis H. Barker<br>
W.W. Norton, New York, 1961.<br>
LC: BF633<br>
LCCN: 61-7483<br>
Dewey: 131.333<br>
In some ways this book complements Edward Hunter's book &quot;Brainwashing,
From Pavlov to Powers&quot;, because this
book concentrates its attention on American civilians who happened to be
in China when Mao took over, and were arrested by Mao's forces and subjected to
&quot;thought reform&quot; in prison.<br>

The author states (p.21) that he checked his hypotheses with others like
Lifton and Barnett, and drew heavily from Hunter, so obviously that
small group of pioneers were in communication with each other,
trading ideas and information.<br>

This book and the previous two by Hunter and Lifton are the classics of
the field, and are simply <i>must</i> reading for students of brainwashing
and mind-control programs.<br>

Dr. Schein saw &quot;thought reform&quot; programs as working in stages:
<ol>
<li> <i>Unfreezing</i> &#8212; Make the subject lose his previous identity.
Shatter his self-confidence and belief in himself, his moral standards,
and his previous philosophy. Make his personality fluid and changeable.
<li> <i>Changing</i> &#8212; Change the subject into whatever is desired.
<li> <i>Refreezing</i> &#8212; Make the subject lock in the changes by solidifying
his new personality.
</ol>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The bases for being judged guilty which he [the victim] must come to appreciate are
the following:
<ol>
<li> Guilt by Association.
<li> Guilt by Intention.
<li> Guilt for Incorrect Attitudes.
<li> Guilt for Incorrect Thoughts.
<li> Guilt for Having Knowledge.
<li> Guilt for Harmful Action.
<li> Guilt for Failure to Act.
<li> Guilt for Having a Characteristic Personal Fault or Faults.
<li> Guilt for Having Dangerous Social Origins.
</ol>
<font face="Times,Roman">
&#8212; pages 141-143.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even back in 1960, Dr. Schein saw that Alcoholics Anonymous was a mind-control
or thought-reform program:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Certain organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) do not
deliberately unfreeze an individual but refuse to take anyone under
their care who is not already unfrozen. Thus a person does not
become eligible for care by AA unless he has really become
desperate, is dissatisfied with himself, and is prepared to turn
his fate over to some greater power.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman">
&#8212; page 272.</font>
<p>
The interesting question arises then, in what way are groups
in fact used in the unfreezing of individuals in the parallel
types of institutions which we have discussed? ...
In AA the small discussion group plays a key therapeutic role;
in mental hospitals there has been an increasing reliance on
therapy groups, work groups of various sorts, and/or patient
self-government groups, where in each case the assumption is
made explicitly or implicitly that for the new group member  the
membership experience will produce influence of a kind desired
by the institution; in educational workshops, like those concentrating
on human relations training, the group experience is considered
the key educational experience...<br>
<font face="Times,Roman">
&#8212; page 274.</font>
<p>
But what of those institutions which are entered voluntarily and
from which the individual may withdraw voluntarily &#8212; educational
institutions, religious orders, AA, psychoanalysis, revival meetings,
fraternities, and so on? We believe that in such institutions the
social pressures which can be generated can be as coercive as the
physical constraints previously described. Not only is voluntary
withdrawal generally defined as failure, but the act of entry into
an institution may constitute a more or less irrevocable commitment
in that the individual often cuts himself off from alternate paths
when he makes his decision. In addition to these two forces there is
acting perhaps an even more powerful one, the confirmation by fellow
group members and by &quot;back home&quot; significant others of the emerging
institutional identity. The young man who has entered a religious
order and wishes after half a year to leave it will have a difficult
time psychologically if he is considered by his peers and teachers
to be a good student, if his parents have their hearts set on his
becoming a priest, if his friends have already abandoned his old
identity in their own eyes and treat him only in terms of his new one,
and if his termination is defined by all concerned as an act of moral
weakness. Obviously these pressures are not always as strong as we
have implied, and obviously people do leave institutions like religious
orders, but equally obviously it generally requires an act of great
courage to do so. Such courage is not too dissimilar to the courage
required to resist the pressures of thought reform.<br>

A fascinating book about how the human brain works, and how we form snap judgements.
Covers both kinds of snap judgements &#8212; situations were the first intuitive impression
is stunningly brilliantly correct, and situations where it is grossly disastrously wrong &#8212;
and the author explains why that happens.
This book is relevant to cultish behavior in that most cult members do not really think,
they merely react to information in a mindless knee-jerk kind of reaction (either
instant agreement or instant disapproval, depending on whether it supports their
pre-conceived notions), and the author discusses such non-thinking behavior.

Dewey: 303.3'75&#8212;dc22<br>
This book is a classic, and must-readng for the student of
propaganda techniques.
Edward Bernays was the godfather of propaganda.
He basically invented the science of propaganda.
Bernays was the nephew of Sigmund Freud, and he did a study of
the human mind from the
viewpoint of figuring out what would fool people into doing what
he wanted. The word is, even the Nazi Minister of Propaganda
Joseph Goebbels learned a few tricks from Bernays.<br>
Bernays considered skilled propagandists to be the
highest of the high of the human race. (He was just a little bit
self-congratulatory there, wasn't he?)
Edward Bernays was such an arrogant elitist that he
believed that propagandists should rule the world because they
were the people who were smart enough and skilled enough and
clever enough to get everybody else to do their bidding.<br>
And Bernays did quite a bit of ruling himself. He contracted
himself out to millionaires, and used his propaganda skills to
make things go their way. Thus Bernays also invented the modern
art of public relations, and his influence on Madison Avenue
advertising was immense. One of Bernays' projects was working
for the tobacco industry in the nineteen-twenties, convincing
women that it was okay for them to smoke cigarettes.<br>
As you can imagine, some people consider Edward Bernays to be the
Devil incarnate.<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Behind the doors of the so-called sleep room on Ward 2 South,
Dr. Ewen Cameron, the director of Montreal's Allan Memorial
Institute, exposed dozens of his own patients to barbaric treatments
from which some have never recovered. Operating under the belief
that he could wipe brains clean of &quot;bad&quot; behaviour
and program in new behavior, Cameron kept patients in a chemical
sleep for weeks and months at a time, exposed them to massive amounts
of electro-shock and drugs such as LSD, and forced them to listen
to tape-recorded messages repeated endlessly through headphones.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Cameron was not alone in his desire to reprogram the human brain.
The U.S. intelligence establishment found in him an eager collaborator,
and funded his work substantially and covertly.<br>

This book is fascinating. It tells how the CIA was one of the first
investigators of LSD. They hoped it would make a great truth serum,
or at least a good incapacitating agent &#8212; something that would
render enemy soldiers helpless, and give us &quot;war without killing&quot;.
They did a lot of experimenting with it, trying it on
everybody from themselves to unaware civilians in San Francisco.
They even gave Ken Kesey his first dose. So bone up on your history,
kiddies. Before there was the Grateful Dead and the Merry Pranksters,
there was the CIA.

Great stuff. Takes us into the Nazi system of health, which was

and was the first major world leader to implement a strong program
against tobacco. German medicine under the Nazis was a strange mix

<i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alexander Lowen, M.D.<br>

Collier Macmillan Publishers, London, 1983.<br>
ISBN: 0-02-575890-X<br>
LC: RC553.N36L38 1983<br>
LCCN: 83-18794<br>
This is a great book, a real classic. Dr. Lowen advances the idea that
narcissism is not falling in love with one's self, but rather with a
false image of one's self. That small subtle difference actually makes
a very large difference. In the original Greek mythology, Narcissus died
&#8212; starved to death &#8212; because he was obsessed with his own image and
stared at it endlessly.
But as Narcissus approached death, his real emaciated appearance could not have
been very attractive. Narcissus was seeing an illusion, not his true
appearance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Lowen advances the idea that narcissism is often caused
by child abuse and prolonged humiliation and pain in childhood. The child
adopts a persona where he feels no pain and is powerful and invulnerable.
The child thinks, <i>&quot;When I grow up, I'll be so powerful and strong that no
one can hurt me or humiliate me ever again.&quot;</i> Then the child, who grows into
adulthood, spends the rest of his life pursuing and defending an illusion.
Narcissists are obsessed with defending and preserving their image &#8212; they can't
stand it if somebody &quot;makes them look bad&quot; &#8212; they can't stand criticism.
They deny their true feelings and put on a mask of unfeeling, because
they imagine that it will keep them from being hurt again.
Likewise, they completely disregard other people's feelings.
They are obsessed with power and control, so that they can
control the world around them and prevent anyone from humiliating
them again.
Narcissists are often extremely seductive and manipulative people, often charismatic
charmers, and occasionally high achievers as well.
They lie habitually, without giving it a second thought.
They fear insanity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, Dr. Lowen was describing
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Bill Wilson</a>, the
abused son of an alcoholic father and a neurotic mother.

LCCN: 98-11879<br>
Dewey: 362.29'18'0973&#8212;dc21 or 362.291809 WHI<br>
This book is a mixed product.
The beginning, the history of early alcoholism treatment is excellent.
And the ending chapters, on the various alcoholism treatment programs,
are informative.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But the chapters on Alcoholics Anonymous (15 to 18) and the
chapters on Hazelden and the &quot;Minnesota Model&quot;
are just reprints of the standard A.A. P.R. handouts.
The strongest criticism of A.A. that the author can
muster is asking whether it will work as well for women and racial minoritites
as it does with white men,
without ever having established that it works on white men.
(That's the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank"><i>Assume The Major Premise</i></a>.)
In fact, he dodges the whole question of the effectiveness of A.A. treatment
by saying that A.A. isn't a treatment program, and A.A. doesn't keep records (page 176).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The author devotes only two pages, 156 and 157, to criticisms of A.A.,
and the author fails to take a single criticism of A.A. seriously. It's
all a white-wash. For example:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>2) A.A.'s relative effectiveness has not been scientifically validated.</i>
This is a relatively benign criticism that decries the lack of scientific
study of A.A.'s effectiveness compared to that of other interventions.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Baloney. That is not a minor criticism, it's the whole ball game.<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>A.A. treatment does not work, period.
It is harmful, ineffective, quack medicine. Period.</i><br>
</font>
There have been several good scientific studies that showed that A.A. is a failure,
even one done by a current Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Prof. and Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
but there has never been one that showed that A.A. worked.
See the web page on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank"><i>The Effectiveness
of the Twelve-Step Treatment</i></a> for more on that.<br>
Likewise, when
<a href="#Fingarette" target="_blank">Herbert Fingarette</a>,
<a href="#Peele" target="_blank">Stanton Peele</a>, and
<a href="#Bufe" target="_blank">Charles Bufe</a>
criticized A.A. for being unsuccessful, the author &quot;refuted&quot;
their statements by quoting
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">one of Bill Wilson's
most blatantly dishonest grandiose lies</a>
from the <i>Big Book</i> as if it were a fact (page 156):<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once
and remained that way; 25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the
remainder, those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Still, this book is required reading for the serious student of alcoholism and its treatment.

Dewey: 362.29'086'22&#8212;dc21 or 362.29 C775d 1997<br>
A dead give-away of this book's attitude is that fact that it quotes
Dr. G. Douglas Talbott
as an authority on drug- or alcohol-impaired professionals,
but never bothers to mention the fact that
<a href="orange-letters.html#Talbott" target="_blank">Talbott had a long history</a> of
torturing his patient-prisoners into committing
suicide at his Atlanta, Georgia treatment facility.
After this book was published, Talbott lost a $1.3 million
lawsuit because of such extreme malpractice, fraud, and false imprisonment.
But this book does not have a single paragraph criticizing
abuse of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) by employers or program administrators.
This author seems to be unaware that it has ever happened, or could ever happen.
(See
<a href="#Fransway" target="_blank">Rebecca Fransway's book <i>AA Horror Stories</i></a>
for more information on that.)<br>
<p>
The author promotes the idea of addictions being a disease without even
questioning the dogma:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Addiction is a disease, and we treat it like any other medical illness.
If you come to me and say, 'I have the illness of addiction and need treatment,'
we'll give you a leave of absence just as if you had a broken leg and needed to
be in traction for a while. But if you keep it a secret and endanger your health
and the lives of your patients, you're out on your ass!&quot;
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 177.)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font size="-1">
(<font color="blue">And how did you get that broken leg?<br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Well, I was just joy-popping leg-breaker pills at parties, only
on weekends, you know...&quot;</font>)
</font>
<p>
Much of this book is just a carbon copy of the standard A.A. religious dogma:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A. members agree that while
<a href="orange-letters10.html#any_God" target="_blank">it is not necessary to believe in a personal
God</a>, it is important for alcoholics to realize that <i>they themselves are not God!</i>
That is, they are not the center of the universe, nor are they running the show.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 217. Italics in original.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

This book also uncritically promotes the idea that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#miracle_cult" target="_blank">A.A. and spiritual experiences will somehow
magically solve all alcohol or drug problems</a>.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Steven Hyman, directory of Harvard University's Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative,
explains that &quot;addiction is a form of adaptation&quot; (Delbanco and
Delbanco 1995, p.61). ... He adds, &quot;I suspect that if I could compare
scans of the brain of an alcoholic person before and after treatment in a

<i>&quot;He <i>suspects</i> that the 12 steps do something to the brain...&quot;</i>
That is the level of &quot;scientific proof&quot; of the efficacy of 12-Step
treatment programs that this book provides.
And yet the author enthusiastically endorses the idea of shoving
any and all drinking or doping professionals
into EAPs that practice the 12-Step cult religion.

Factual and accurate information about addiction prevention programs and

Scholarly, well-researched, and realistic.
Unfortunately, there isn't much evidence that the programs actually work.
It's like this:<br>

This book is a blockbuster. It is must reading for anyone in the
alcoholism or addictions treatment or rehabilitation field.
It details a lot of the selling of the standard recovery myths,
like selling the idea of codependency and turning its treatment
into an industry, and &quot;recovering&quot; false memories,
and &quot;reparenting&quot;, and more.
He describes &quot;Codependency&quot; as invent a non-existent disease, and then
charge a fortune to treat it.

And one chapter title is priceless: <i>The Metastasizing of Metaphor</i>.<br>

This book is excellent. It definitely ends up in the Top 10 List of books
that you must read if you are thinking about quitting (or perhaps if
a loved one is trying to quit, or needs to quit).<br>
She covers addiction and alcoholism from a lot of different viewpoints,
including the need for improved nutrition and getting off of other
addictions like nicotine, caffeine, or TV.<br>
She is about the only one who addresses the issue of the narcissism
inherent in A.A., which it got from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
the champion narcissist, Bill Wilson</a>.
(Pages 153-154.) She is also the only one to talk about <i>Candida
Albicans</i>, a potentially-devastating yeast infection, in connection
with alcoholism. Something that A.A. all too often fails to consider
is that people kill their pain with alcohol because they are sick and
in pain, not because they are sinful.
Ms. Kasl has the brains to realize this.
<br>
She also covers recovery from the woman's viewpoint better than
anybody else I've seen. This book is simply <i>Must</i> reading for
women alcoholics and addicts.<br>
She also has a good take on the inherently-patriarchal attitudes of
A.A., and the fallacies of codependency.<br>
An example of her perceptiveness:
As a counselor and therapist who has had to repair a lot of
refugees from A.A. and 12-Step programs, she has a lot
to say about things like
<p>

<li> The group becomes grandiose in its self-definition &#8212; &quot;Ours

<li> People get locked into stereotyped roles.
<li> The group becomes paranoid about outsiders or those who
question the norm.
<li> People talk like robots.
<li> In-group jargon predominates in conversations.
<li> The group exerts pressure on people to stay.
<li> People use the group for sexual needs.

The authoress interviewed 222 &quot;masters&quot; who had remained sober for

Almost 100 of them quit while attending A.A. meetings, but the others attended
less-known groups like Women for Sobriety (WFS), SMART Recovery (Self Management

This was one of the original calls to war against the Evil Empire
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Note that Jack Trimpey has declared this book obsolete, and says
that you should just read the next one, &quot;Rational Recovery.&quot;
The funny thing is, I don't find it to be obsolete.
Trimpey borrowed some techniques from Doctors Maultsby and
Ellis like the ABCs of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and
did a good job of explaining them.
Trimpey did a good job of collecting a variety of
tools for quitting drinking and staying quit and working
them together into a fair toolkit.
This book does what A.A. only claims to do &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#tools" target="_blank">give you
the tools you will need to maintain sobriety</a>".

This is Trimpey's second book about quitting drinking
using rational techniques. He changed his mind about a
lot of things and decided that you only need one technique
to defeat cravings &#8212; the ability to recognize and dispute
the Addictive Voice as it cajoles, wheedles, and seduces
you into having &quot;just one&quot;.
This book is worth reading just for the chapter in the back
that describes a counselling session where Trimpey exposes
&quot;the Beast&quot;,
the addiction monster that tries to con us into drinking or
using again (really, the

This book does not disappoint. Strongly recommended for those who are struggling to

A great book. Takes up the thread of the web page

Your child might die there. Many already have.

And the harm done often far outweighs any benefits.  The liabilities of such programs
include children who are scarred for life
and spend many years &#8212; occasionally the rest of their lives &#8212;
trying to overcome <i>post-traumatic stress disorder</i>.
And many children who did not use drugs before being tortured by such a program did afterwards.

<i>Controlling Your Drinking: Tools to Make Moderation Work for You</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; William R. Miller and Ricardo F. Mu&ntilde;oz, PhD<br>
Prof. William R. Miller, of the Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology,
University of New Mexico, could have written a scholarly tome on alcohol abuse
(and in fact, he has written several), but this book is non-technical and is aimed at the layman.
That is, it is written in simple, clear, easily-understood language and is intended
for someone with a problem controlling his drinking.
It is very systematic and complete, and loaded with good advice and working techniques,
and should be helpful to anyone who is drinking too much, no matter whether
he ends up choosing moderation or complete abstinence.
This book will do what A.A. falsely claims to do: Give you the tools you need to stop
(or moderate) drinking.
This book includes:<br>
<ol>
<li> Keeping track
<li> Taking charge
<li> Slowing down
<li> Discovering your triggers
<li> Relaxing
<li> Visual techniques for relaxing
<li> Managing anxiety and fear
<li> Coping with negative moods and depression
<li> Managing a positive self-concept

Great stuff. A huge amount of true information about alcohol abuse, alcohol addiction,
and relapse prevention. Rather scholarly and heavy going;
written for professional therapists and counselors rather
than for the average alcoholic.
Recommended. Chapters are:
<ul>
<li> Part 1. Relapse Prevention: General Overview
<ul>
<li> Chapter 1. Relapse Prevention: Theoretical and Overview of the Model
<li> Chapter 2. Situational Determinants of Relapse and Skill-Training
Interviews
<li> Chapter 3. Cognitive Factors in the Relapse Process
<li> Chapter 4. Cognitive Assessment and Intervention Procedures
for Relapse Prevention.
<li> Chapter 5. Lifestyle Modification
</ul>
<li> Part 2. Applications with Specific Addictive Behaviors
<ul>
<li> Chapter 6. Alcoholic Relapse Prevention and Intervention:
Models and Methods
<li> Chapter 7. The Problem Drinker's Project: A Programmatic
Application of Social-Learning-Based Treatment
<li> Chapter 8. Preventing Relapse in Ex-Smokers: A Self-Management
Approach
</ul>
</ul>
G. Alan Marlatt wrote the first five chapters, and a variety
of other authorities and experts wrote the following four.
The authors are quite specific in their descriptions of
tools and techniques that work to help people avoid relapsing,
and that is the greatest value of this book (to me, at least).

who has some special insights into the problem of women

<i>Strong Drink; The Curse And the Cure</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; T. S. Arthur<br>
Hubbard Brothers, Philadelpha, Cincinnati, Chicago and Springfield, Mass. 1877.<br>
N.D. Thompson &amp; Co., St. Louis Mo.: A. L. Bancroft &amp; Co., San Francisco, Cal.<br>
A really old book about alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
The first half of the book describes the societal problem of alcohol abuse.
The second half describes the solution: go to church and pray and have faith.<br>
Still, a fascinating piece of history, and there is more to it than just a simplistic
&quot;go to church&quot; answer. This author tried hard to explore all of the medical and spiritual facets
of the problem of alcohol abuse. It also described the Women's Christian Temperance Union 
and &quot;sobriety clubs&quot;.
The resemblance of the sobriety clubs to A.A. groups is striking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<center>
FORMATION OF CLUBS
</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The method pursued by Dr. Reynolds in the formation of these clubs is very simple. There is a constitution
with by-laws, to which the following pledge is prefixed: &quot;Having seen and felt the evils of intemperance,
therefore, Resolved, That we, the undersigned, for our own good and the good of the world in which we live,
do hereby promise and engage, with the help of Almighty God, to abstain from buying, selling, or using 
alcoholic or malt beverages, wine and cider included.&quot; Article III, of the constitution gives the qualification
for membership: &quot;All male persons of the age of eighteen or upwards, who have been in the habit of using
intoxicating liquor to a greater or lesser extent, are eligible to membership in this club.&quot;
After organizing a club of persons who have been addicted to drink, Dr. Reynolds appeals to the Christian
women of the locality to throw around them the shield of their care and sympathy, and urges upon the
people at large the necessity of upholding and encouraging them in every possible way.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The meetings of the clubs are held at least once during the week, in the evenings; and
on Sunday afternoons or evenings, the clubs, with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, hold public
religious temperance meetings, which are often crowded to overflowing. The order of exercises at these
public meetings consist of prayer, reading of Scripture and brief addresses by reformed men, interspersed
with the singing of such hymns as &quot;Rock of Ages,&quot; &quot;Hold the Fort,&quot; &quot;I Need Thee Every Hour,&quot; etc.
Brief addresses are the rule, and a hymn is usually sung between each address.<br>

This book shows that Bill Wilson had nothing original
when he copied the theology and meetings of the Oxford Group as a &quot;solution to alcoholism&quot;.
T. S. Arthur had already described the whole A.A. &quot;program&quot; in 1877, even including the women's auxiliary Al-Anon,
and the fact that membership was open to all who wished to quit drinking, and one or two
meetings per week, and God will help you to quit drinking.
Bill Wilson liked to describe Alcoholics Anonymous as 
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#greatest_of_all_time" target="_blank">
&quot;probably one of the greatest medical and spiritual developments of all time&quot;</a>,
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#miracle_of_the_century" target="_blank">
&quot;the miracle of the century&quot;</a>,
but he didn't bother to mention the fact that his &quot;program&quot; was really created
by other people in the previous century.

A very small (20 page) report on Alcoholics Anonymous in Oregon in 1965,
and its relations with alcoholism treatment professionals. He observed many
of the failings of A.A. that are commonplace today, like resistance to taking
medications even when needed, territorial jealousy, stubbornly clinging to
outmoded and dogmatic ideas of alcoholism, and refusal to study treatment failures
and revise the A.A. program.

<i>The Alcoholics Anonymous Experience: A Close-Up View For Professionals</i>

The sociologist Milton A. Maxwell, Ph.D., studied A.A. for a summer, and got
converted into a true believer in the cult. He says in the introduction that he got
changed by A.A. in the course of studying it, and this book shows it.
This book is pretty much a definitive manual of A.A. cult dogma.<br>
Maxwell even does the sober/dry tap-dance:
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>If you quit drinking but don't
go to A.A. meetings, then you aren't really sober, you are only dry.</i></font><br>
But soon, you are only &quot;dry&quot;, with quotation marks around it;
you don't even rate the word dry. (Pages 42-43 and 116-128.)<br>
Then, after imbuing the word sobriety with all kinds of special meanings,
Maxwell has a chapter titled &quot;More Than Sobriety&quot;, where
he tells us that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Non-A.A. observers who attend only open speaker meetings can easily obtain
an incomplete and even distorted view of A.A. because of the rather heavy
emphasis upon the not-drinking meaning of sobriety.<br>

This is one of the most important studies of the treatment of alcoholism &#8212; <i>a randomized longitudinal controlled study</i>.
It was the largest and most expensive test of A.A. treatment ever done, and it found that
a year of A.A., even accompanied by giving patients full access to all of the
facilities of the hospital, yielded results no better than having a doctor
talk to the patients for <i>just one hour</i>, telling them to quit drinking.

This is the blockbuster study that showed that many alcoholics
recover from self-destructive drinking by tapering off to moderate,
controlled, drinking. This study created a firestorm of controversy.
The A.A. empire pulled out all of its big guns to fight this news.

<i>How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;

In spite of its negative title, this is actually a very positive book.
This is one of the best-looking 'alternatives to
A.A.' kind of books that I've seen (from my biased viewpoint, of course).
It definitely contains a very strong
flavor of spirituality, but without the cult religion aspect.
This is a good 'something' for those who try to take the middle road,
for those who try to be spiritual but sensible,
for those who want something other than either atheism or blind
faith in cult religion.
<br>
For example:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...the Love that binds the Universe together gently encourages me to
go even where there is intolerance, hatred, and anger. For Love wisely
knows that to go there in peace and acceptance will literally
transform these negative traits into Love itself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There can only be duality of good and evil, right and wrong, love and
fear at the lower levels of awareness. For at the highest levels,
there is only Love. Love sends itself out and returns to itself.
All the world is a journey in which love seeks to go where it is not
and heal itself. We can each do this individually with our own lives
and our own physical bodies. To go where love is not, fully supported
by the Universe, we heal.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Bill Wilson had a bad habit of
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">
accusing everyone who didn't buy his
peculiar Buchmanite religious beliefs</a> of being an atheist.
This book is a good answer to that.<br>
It also contains chapters on Food and Cigarettes, Fear and Dependency,
The Nature of Addiction, The Role of Ritual, Pleasure and Guilt,
Finding My Inner God, and much more.<br>
If you are looking for an alternative to the A.A. philosophy, then
definitely check this book out.

Ruth Fox, M.D., and Peter Lyon<br>
Random House, New York, 1955.<br>
LCCN: 55-8170<br>
Dewey: 613.81 F83<br>
Hopelessly obsolete and simplistic. On pages 158 and 159 they consider it
big news that addicted alcoholics can suffer from withdrawal symptoms. And
on page 97 they consider Alcoholics Anonymous to be <i>The Answer</i>.
They describe a man who joined A.A. and started doing <i>The Steps</i>
like this:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This phase is anticipatory. The Twelve Steps constitute the cardinal
programmatic aspect of Alcoholics Anonymous, than which, for
alcoholics, there is no better therapeutic approach. The role of this
lay organization, which has done so much to show doctors how
alcoholics can be recovered, will be discussed later in this book.<br>
</font></blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
Note that Ruth Fox was the founder of ASAM &#8212; The American Society of Addiction
Medicine &#8212; another A.A. front that exists to promote Alcoholics Anonymous and
its 12-Step program to doctors.<br>
</font>
<p>
One of the most revealing details about Dr. Ruth Fox's program comes from
William L. White in his book <i>Slaying the Dragon</i>, where he quotes
Ruth Fox as writing that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#LSD_therapy" target="_blank">she felt that LSD was useful</a>
because it made patients
more willing to &quot;take disulfiram, attend group therapy, and to
affiliate with A.A.&quot;. (Ruth Fox, <i>Alcoholism, Behavioral Research,
Therapeutic Approaches</i>, 1967, page 775, quoted on page 229 of
<i>Slaying the Dragon</i>.) So Ruth Fox felt that LSD was good because it
helped to brainwash the patients and make them do what she wanted?

in the Treatment of the Alcoholic</i> and
Dr. Ruth Fox, <i>Disulfiram (Antabuse) as an Adjunct in the Treatment of
Alcoholism</i>.<br>
Dr. Fox described how she gave her patients disulfiram and then alcohol, to
deliberately make them sick, in an attempt to build up an aversion to alcohol.
Even after she discovered that the aversion therapy didn't work, and even
after one patient nearly died from an almost fatal reaction to a single ounce
of alcohol (p. 244), she still insisted on giving each patient
at least one session of being sick from the disulfiram/alcohol combination,
before she released them from the hospital.

<i>The Disease Concept of Alcoholism</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; E. M. Jellinek<br>
College and University Press, New Haven, Conn., in association with
Hillhouse Press, New Brunswick, NJ, 1960.<br>
LCCN: 60-9206<br>
LC: RC565.J4<br>
This is the original book that was so influential in promoting the disease
concept of alcoholism. Unfortunately, what is almost never mentioned is that
Jellinek's major source of data for his theory was about 90 questionaires that
had been answered by true-believer Alcoholics Anonymous members.
Even Jellinek himself warned against overgeneralizing the results, but the
believers did it anyway, and ever since, they have been claiming that the disease
concept of alcoholism is a proven fact. Jellinek even added a lot of qualifiers
and reserve clauses to his findings, which the boosters of the disease theory
have somehow ignored for 40 years:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Mardones points out that in animal experimentation an &quot;overpowering desire&quot;
in the above sense has not been demonstrated and that the increased voluntary
alcohol intake by animals cannot be equated with craving.<br>

<font size="-1">Page 43.</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The fact remains that the majority of French alcohol addicts do not display
pre-alcoholic neurotic or other gross psychological vulnerabilities, but rather
minor psychological vulnerabilities.<br>

to designate a variety of phenomena, among them the loss of control.<br>

This is a strange book. A psychotherapist describes in detail seven
hard-core alcoholic patients, and in general terms his 30 such alcoholic patients.
He makes some strange and contradictory statements. Sometimes he borrows from
Alcoholics Anonymous, which he first praises and then disagrees with, like
citing the &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; doctrine and describing how all of his patients
simply relapsed repeatedly, and then explaining how he cured all 30 of his patients
by educating them in religion, philosophy, and history. So they weren't
powerless. Yes, he used a religious or philosophical cure,
which he also called &quot;Educative Counseling&quot;,
by assigning religious, philosophical, and historical readings to his patients, and he
insists that it worked as a cure for all 30 of his patients.  But the one phrase that the author
never mentioned was &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;. He showed no awareness of its existence.

<i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-Step Programs</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; James Christopher<br>
Prometheus Books, Buffalo, NY, 1992.<br>
ISBN: 0-87975-726-4<br>
Dewey: 362.2928 C556s<br>
This book is about
Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) a.k.a. &quot;Save Our Selves&quot;.
SOS is an alternative recovery method for those alcoholics or drug
addicts who are uncomfortable with the spiritual content of widely
available 12-Step programs. SOS takes a reasonable, secular approach
to recovery and maintains that sobriety is a separate issue from
religion or spirituality. SOS credits the individual for achieving and
maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any &quot;Higher
Power.&quot; SOS respects recovery in any form regardless of the path by
which it is achieved. It is not opposed to or in competition with any
other recovery programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Especially check out the interview with Kenneth Blum, titled
&quot;The Fickle Gene&quot;. Blum discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcohol abuse, and perhaps also a
tendency towards drug addiction.<br>

<i>Moderate Drinking; The Moderation Management Guide</i>

Crown Trade Paperbacks, New York, 1994.<br>
ISBN: 0-517-88656-1<br>
Dewey: 613.81 K617m<br>
This is the one. That is, this is the book that is at the heart of a large
controversy. Audrey Kishline ended up giving up on her own program,
and rejoined Alcoholics Anonymous. Three months later, she relapsed
and drove
while extremely drunk, and caused an auto accident and killed two
innocent people. Then she did some years of hard time in prison.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Some people like to blame A.A. for the crash; some like to blame
M.M... It seems to me that neither accusation is really fair &#8212;
Kishline obviously had her own baggage that she carried with her.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such misfortune neither proves nor disproves the idea of controlled
drinking or moderation management. My personal attitude is, &quot;If
it works for you, okay.&quot; But it doesn't work for many, including
me. That is, I cannot even have one beer or I will become readdicted.
There is just something funny about my brain or biochemistry or
psychology, or something...
I know, because I did that experiment for too many years, and
learned the answer beyond a reasonable doubt.
So, for me, total abstinence is the only thing that has ever worked.
Still, I know of <i>a few</i> &quot;alcoholics&quot; who are managing
to walk that dangerous tight-rope, but only a very small few.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Your mileage may vary. Let the buyer beware, etc...

The book is a gold mine of alternative information about alcohol. That
is, it directly challenges the A.A. party line about alcohol and its
effects. It skewers a lot of myths and stereotypes about alcohol
and alcoholics. Recommended for its true information.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But watch out: there is a lot in here that could
be used to rationalize continued alcohol abuse. Sometimes, the truth
is a two-edged sword, and this is one of those times.
I personally recommend total abstinence for the serious alcoholic,
because it is the only thing that I see working for some people, like
me. But you have to figure out your truth for yourself.
As above, Your mileage may vary, Let the buyer beware, etc...

Dewey 362.29'18&#8212;dc20<br>
LC: HV5801.O25 1993<br>
This book is about the Daytop program, a residential rehab program
based on Synanon ideas.
The author is quick to explain how they were inspired
by Synanon, but soon disassociated themselves from Synanon and
Chuck Dederich, because those guys were all crazy and ill-mannered.
Still, Daytop kept the idea of &quot;confrontational attack therapy&quot;,
an idea which has led to an awful lot of child abuse (and adult abuse,
too).<br>
This book is very interesting reading, giving the whole history of
Daytop. Unfortunately, it is hard to get excited about the program
when they won't tell what their success rate actually is. Just like
with Alcoholics Anonymous, we get lot of grandiose hand-waving and
talk about how great it is, and a few <i>proof-by-anecdote</i> stories,
and a McDonald's-style <i>&quot;millions served&quot;</i> claim,
but nothing more specific about success rates, relapse rates, drop-outs,
and all of the things that really matter. The basic message of this
book is really rather fascistic (as was Synanon):
<br>
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;If you kick the addicts' asses
with tough love, you will get good results. They all need discipline;
they all need to grow up.&quot;
<br>
<i>Jawohl, Herr Kommandant! Sieg Heil!</i>
</font>
<br>
If the program is so great, why did they leave out all of the numbers?
<br>
<font color="blue">
(I get hearsay, through the grapevine, telling me that their numbers
are no better than anyone else's, that they have the same old 90% or
95% failure/dropout/relapse rate.
More solid numbers to follow, when I get them.)

Standard Hazelden propaganda on how to force people to spend

how to do &quot;interventions&quot; where you confront a loved one

off-the-wall stuff like aroma therapy. Whatever works for you.
I can't endorse the techniques listed here, because I didn't use
them personally, but they look like they could help some people,
perhaps many people. One of the best contributions this book makes
is right at the start, &quot;A New View Of Alcoholism&quot;.
It's a hundred times more realistic than Bill Wilson's &quot;You
are born an alcoholic because you are a disgusting sinner.&quot;

Far more true facts about alcoholism than your average &quot;recovery&quot; book contains.
It even dares to say:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet for all its strengths, A.A. is not perfect, and the recovering alcoholic
should be warned of A.A.'s shortcomings. First, A.A. is not a treatment program,
and alcoholics who walk in off the street have a very rough time trying to
stay sober. The alcoholic who is just starting a new life of sobriety should
realize this fact and not be disheartened by those A.A. members who stop
attending meetings and start drinking again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The recovering alcoholic should also beware of the A.A. belief that character flaws
or personality defects cause alcoholics to get into trouble with alcohol, a
belief which simply has no basis in fact. The alcoholic should be assured throughout
treatment that his personality did not cause his disease and that he is
in no way responsible for it. This assurance will rid him of years of
accumulated guilt and shame and help him to understand that abstinence is essential
for the simple but very real reason that he is physically incapable of processing
alcohol in a normal way. If he believes that his personality caused his disease,
he may then believe that once his personality problems are fixed, he can return
to normal drinking. Furthermore, a guilty and ashamed alcoholic may rebel
against a program that aggravates these feelings and forfeit his sobriety in the
process.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Patients should be taught never to base the 4th step &#8212; &quot;Made a searching
and fearless moral inventory&quot; &#8212; on a review of their past drinking behavior.
Instead, the inventory should be based on their conduct <i>after</i>
detoxification and enlightenment about their disease and the recovery process. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Finally, the alcoholic should understand the grievous error in the A.A. belief
that is is acceptable and even beneficial to drink coffee or tea and to eat
foods high in sugar such as candies or ice cream when depressed, anxious,
irritable, or feeling the need for a drink. This is dangerous first aid, for
while caffeine and sweets have the immediate effect of elevating the
alcoholic's low blood sugar, their use is followed soon after by a sharp drop
in blood sugar, thus intensifying the hypoglycemic symptoms. Worst of all for
the alcoholic, an unstable blood sugar level often leads to an impulse to drink
if not an outright conscious craving for alcohol. It seems clear that hypoglycemia
is a primary cause of the mood fluctuations and &quot;white knuckle&quot; sobriety so
often seen around A.A. and also a major cause of &quot;slips.&quot;<br>

Another pathetic piece of 12-Step propaganda, of no merit.
Family members are advised to join Al-Anon with these words quoted from an Al-Anon
pamphlet:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For the very beginning we learn that we are powerless to control an alcoholic's
drinking. Until we stop trying to control, we will continue to live with the
frustration that made us seek Al-Anon. &nbsp; ...<br>
In Al-Anon we discover that no situation is really hopeless and that it is
possible for us to find contentment and even happiness, whether the alcoholic
is still drinking or not. &nbsp; ...<br>

the Al-Anon pamphlet P-32, <i>This Is Al-Anon</i>.)</font>

<p>
So, Mrs. Housewife, quit trying to get your husband to quit drinking.
That job is reserved for the A.A. men.
Besides, what are you doing, bothering your pretty little head with
reading books, anyway?<br>
<p>
The authors conclude:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It [Al-Anon] can give you a recovery program you need in order to grow personally
in harmony with the recovery of the alcoholic/addict you care about. And for you,
this might be it's most important benefit of all.<br>
<font size="-1">(Page 120.)</font>
</font></blockquote>
<p>
So once again we see that Mommy is spiritually sick and in need of a 12-Step recovery program
because Daddy drinks too much beer.
<p>
Their advice to help recovering alcoholics and addicts is similar:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He was amazed especially that they [A.A.s] fought off that irresistable craving to drink
and to drug. How? With various basic tools, perfected by many over the years.
A prime one is that AA members don't vow to quit forever. They simply don't drink
or drug today. They quit &quot;one day at a time,&quot; as they endlessly remark.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
And they are given phone numbers by other men (or women, for a woman). And if
they feel an urge to use getting strong, they phone or see another member and confess
the urge and get bolstered by the member not to give in because that insane
urge will soon pass and be gone.<br>
<font size="-1">(Page 120.)</font>
</font></blockquote>
<p>
First off, the cravings are not &quot;irresistable&quot;.<br>
If they were, no one would ever be able to quit.<br>
(That's another repetition of the &quot;Powerless over alcohol&quot; First Step dogma.)
But millions of people do resist the cravings, and do quit, all of the time (and they
usually do it without a 12-Step program).
In fact, the next piece of advice tells the recovering person to resist
the &quot;irresistable&quot; urge to drink or use because it will soon pass.<br>
Also, telling people to only quit for one day at a time is terrible advice &#8212; it
leaves them free to relapse tomorrow  &#8212; <br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I never promised I wouldn't drink when Saturday came.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
Then, having people get on the phone and &quot;confess&quot; their cravings to an
elder member is a slip that reveals the religious nature of the program.
Confession is not the cure for alcoholism.

actually lists &quot;Act As If&quot; as a tool, and
explains that it came from the Oxford Group cult evangelist
<a href="orange-rroot450.html#Shoemaker" target="_blank">Rev. Samuel Shoemaker</a>,
who invented it to get non-believers to start praying:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h3>&quot;Act As If&quot;</h3>
In 1954, the Reverend Samuel M. Shoemaker wrote a story about an unfortunate
who came to him admitting that he didn't believe in God and certainly didn't
know how to pray. Shoemaker asked him to &quot;try an experiment,&quot; as he had nothing
to lose. He asked him to get down on his knees and say anything at all that
came to his mind, addressing his thoughts to &quot;The Unknown.&quot;
He then asked if the man could read just one chapter from the Bible,
from the book of John. Solely out of respect for Shoemaker, the man
obliged, but fighting every step of the way. This went on for some
time, until one day the man actually began praying to God and reading
the Bible and other works on his own. The man eventually became a spiritual
leader within his church. Shoemaker believed that this was possible because
the man &quot;acted as if he had faith&quot; until faith came by accident, or
&quot;until there was an opening for God to come through.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The slogan &quot;act as if&quot; has been used in AA circles ever since.<br>

Dewey: 150.19'8&#8212;dc21 or 150.198 M662r 2002<br>
This is a strange book. The authoress has quite an ax to grind.
The basic premise is that Abraham Maslow allegedly
created a horrible school of humanistic psychology, which led to a
long list of
disciples and disciples of disciples, which led to everything that
is wrong with psychology and psychotherapy today.
Maslow begot Carl Rogers and Franz Boas, and Boas begot Margaret Mead
and Ruth Fulton Benedict, and they or their followers begot everybody
else. She chases chains of connections the way a conspiracy theorist would,
and manages to condemn and blame just about everybody who was anybody
in twentieth-century psychology or therapy. She devotes a couple of
chapters to denouncing Timothy Leary, and then returns to him in the last
chapter to gloat over his death. In between, she criticizes most of
the recovery cults (rightly so), and everybody else too, even
the sixties anti-war movement, feminists, lesbians, and Gloria Steinem.
Almost nobody is spared from at least a few whacks from her stick.
The only conspicuous
recovery cult that she does not denounce is Alcoholics Anonymous
and its other 12-Step bretheren.
She mentions the fact that Timothy Leary gave psilocybin (the active
hallucinogenic chemical in magic mushrooms) to Bill Wilson in December
of 1960 or early 1961 (page 85), but says nothing more about it.
She says that Charles
Dederich, the founder of Synanon, was an alcoholic in A.A. before
setting up his own cult.
She says that Dederich split with A.A. over the issue of a higher power,
but doesn't trace any of the other ideas or faults of Synanon from their
origins in A.A..
She contrasts
<a href="orange-cult_q4.html#Erhard_megalomaniac" target="_blank">
Werner Erhard</a>'s
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#Erhard_pig" target="_blank">
EST hoax</a> and A.A. like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Perhaps the greatest problem that Erhard faced was that many est
graduates were beginning to discover that their post-training
euphoria didn't last.
The belief that we have the power to create our own reality can be
highly motivating. But when things go wrong, it can also lead to
profound depression. This is exactly why Alcoholics Anonymous, the
most successful self-help program in history, insists that its members
acknowledge the existence of a higher power, however loosely defined.
Newcomers often have trouble with this requirement, but in the long
run it protects them from falling into the depressive's trap of
obsessing about things that can't be changed.<br>

But the authoress stubbornly refuses to see that Bill Wilson's faith in
his Higher Power (as well as a dozen years of <i>Working The Steps</i>)
didn't save him from turning into
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#chronic_depression" target="_blank">a very sick chronic depressive</a>.
And the biggest, most successful, and most influential purveyor of
malpsychia and voodoo medicine in the USA is undoubtedly Alcoholics Anonymous.
Joyce Milton just won't even consider that idea.
She blames everybody but A.A. for bad medicine and bad therapy,
and accuses everybody but A.A. of foisting narcissistic psychobabble
and ineffective therapy on the American people.
Strange. (Strange, unless she is a hidden member of Alcoholics Anonymous,
which would explain a lot.)

Good stuff. As the title implies, this book's emphasis is on women's issues,
and how a woman has experienced the self-help movement.
Particularly read chapter four:

My experiences led me to agree with many professional observers that this
classic AA model operates as a cult &#8212; a term I use descriptively,
not judgementally &#8212;
and therein lies the secret of its success. It thrives on exclusivity and
social isolation, on rote repetitions of scriptural doctrine, and on a blind
faith in an omnipotent &quot;leader&quot; and God. It enforces rigid rules of
behavior that virtually program one's every move every day, week, and month.
Members who do best tend to break ties with former friends and family
and relate only to fellow drunks, often attending meetings every day,
sometimes even twice a day. By repetition the Steps and Traditions
become so ingrained that all casual
conversation comes to include key phrases &#8212; &quot;I let go and let God&quot;
is a common saying, for example &#8212; and the idea that one's Higher Power had
a role in virtually every positive moment in one's life is taken for granted
here. The members who told the most inspiring tales, moreover, were generally
the ones whose every moment was coordinated according to the Steps and
Traditions and meeting schedules. Many members speak often of giving up
old haunts and friends to stick &quot;close to home&quot; as one put it,
and the conversation of members tends to revolve so thoroughly around ideas
and activities of recovery that it is probably a relief to old friends when
they drift away. There are alcohol-free social clubs where members meet in
many cities, and many members carry around AA literature and turn to it
whenever they find themselves with nothing to do, for fear that they
will return
to old habits if they relax. &quot;I read the Big Book (the basic text,
written by Bill W.) every day, every time I start to feel nervous,&quot;
one man told me. &quot;It saved me the other day, when I ran into an old
drinking buddy on the subway. He took one look at it and split.&quot;
I had no doubt.<br>

Since one may never &quot;cross talk&quot; or raise issues not related to one's
addiction, or even talk about the addiction itself in terms other than
the Steps prescribe, one is forced, in the interest of one's progress out
of addiction, to internalize and adopt the &quot;mainstream attitudes&quot;
fostered by the program. &nbsp;...<br>
The political ramifications of this tendency to subtly impose a totalizing
ideology on members are easy to see. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
As in any kind of hegemonic discourse or ritual, the absence of apparent ideology
is itself the most powerful kind of ideology, since it can never be acknowledged
or questioned. The political implications of this kind of thinking, this kind
of process, are apparent and depressing. &nbsp; ...<br>
This reactionary tendency of AA is further bolstered by its tendency to exclude
contact with all &quot;outsiders&quot; who may indeed have other ideas about
what has caused a member's suffering and what might be done to assuage it.
One of the characteristics of cults described by
<a href="#Deikman" target="_blank">Arthur Deikman (1990)</a>
is a
tendency to &quot;devalue outsiders&quot; and assume &quot;an attitude of
righteousness&quot; about one's own customs and beliefs. In AA and (to a lesser
degree) other recovery groups, this takes the form of labeling as &quot;in denial&quot;
those who question basic tenets.<br>

ACOA is the only group I visited in which no response was ever expected of anyone.
At times, the silence was so nerve-wracking that I felt all eyes upon me, the

The members of my home group were a bizarre lot behaviorally, although, by
appearance, they were conventional and respectable. &nbsp; ...<br>
Other members of this group &#8212; there were about ten women and four men &#8212;
were apparently even more out of control, unable to handle the emotionally
charged, unresolved feelings from childhood, for reasons that were sometimes
explained &#8212; incest and physical torture &#8212; and sometimes hard to figure out
at all.<br>

 &#8212; There's big money to be made in diagnosing kids who only dabbled with drugs
a couple of times as hard-core addicts, in need of imprisonment
in a residential treatment facility. And once in there, the parents can't
even get their children back because the staff &quot;experts&quot; say
that the kids need treatment. And it's also a cute way to
force either the kids or parents or both to go to Alcoholics
Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, or Al-Anon
12-Step meetings, as part of the &quot;treatment&quot; program.<br>
 &#8212; There are tens of thousands of adolescents whom a raft of
experts say are coerced into entering drug treatment each year
by schools, parents or the courts, despite not having any
serious drug problem.<br>
 &#8212; Joel Brown of the Center for Educational Research and Development
estimates that &quot;less than 10 percent&quot; of the kids who enter
treatment at the insistence of their schools actually have problems.

<i>Cold Turkey</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; A movie starring Dick Van Dyke and Bob Newhart<br>
A great comedy, a classic. The basic plotline is that a backwoods town is
dying because the military base closed. Bob Newhart plays an evil tobacco executive
who wants to become the 'Alfred Nobel' of smoking by offering a huge prize
to any town that totally quits smoking for a month (which he doesn't
believe any town will ever be able to do). Dick Van Dyke plays the preacher
of the dying town, who decides that winning the prize is the only way to get
the town back on its feet. The results are both very funny and very true.
It's a great spoof on smoking and addiction.

<i>Degeneration: The Dark Side of Progress</i>, Ed. by J. Chamberlin and S. Gilman<br>
Columbia University Press, New York, 1985.<br>
ISBN: 0-231-05196-4<br>
LC: CB417.D44 1985<br>
LCCN: 84-21495<br>
A study of the idea of degeneration, which was popular in the nineteenth century.
This book consists of a dozen chapters, each by a different author, which cover a
lot of different aspects of the concept of degeneration, including
anthropology, sociology, biology, medicine, technology, and political theory.
The basic idea of degeneration is the belief that there is some ideal archetype
of humanity, and that whoever differs from that standard is somehow degenerate.
Thus black men were considered to be degenerate versions of white men, and the
Nazis of course took this theory to extremes in declaring that everybody who
wasn't a tall blond blue-eyed Aryan was a degenerate specimen.
Alcoholics were also considered to be degenerate.<br>

Explains how many anti-depressants are a fraud and a hoax.
What happened is, the pharmaceutical companies got one bad, ineffective, anti-depressant approved
by the FDA through fraud, error, and bureaucratic slight-of-hand. Then they got many other
non-working anti-depressants approved by the FDA by merely showing that they work just as well
as the first anti-depressant (that doesn't work). The pharmaceutical companies never
actually proved that the new anti-depressants really worked on patients. So now we have a lot of
bad drugs on the market that don't really work right at all.

<font face="Swiss,Helvetica">
Examined the relationship between sponsorship and abstinence in 12-Step
treatment of injection drug users. 500 former and current injection drug users
(median age 39 yrs) reported sponsorship in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) at baseline and at 6-mo and 1-yr follow-ups. Results
show that having a sponsor in NA/AA was not associated with any improvement in
1-yr sustained abstinence rates compared to non-sponsored controls. However,
being a sponsor over the same time period was strongly associated with substantial
improvements in sustained abstinence rates, even after controlling for involvement
with community organizations, NA/AA meeting attendance, marital status,
employment, participation in drug and alcohol treatment centers, and HIV status.

to recovery and maintains that sobriety is a separate issue from
religion or spirituality. SOS credits the individual for achieving and
maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any &quot;Higher
Power.&quot; SOS respects recovery in any form regardless of the path by

Jack Anderson and Ronald W. May<br>
The Beacon Press, Boston, 1952.<br>
LCCN: 52-11115<br>
Dewey: B M1225A<br>
A pretty good analysis of Senator Joe McCarthy and his methods.
Because this book was published in 1952, it does not tell the end of
the story &#8212; the Army-McCarthy hearings and the Senate's censure of McCarthy.

<i>Sleeping With The Devil; How Washington Sold Our Soul For Saudi Crude</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Robert Baer<br>
Crown Publishers, New York, 2003.<br>
ISBN: 1-4000-5021-9<br>
Dewey: 327.538 B141s 2003<br>
Robert Baer is a former CIA agent who has a lot of expertise about the Middle East.
He has written a very disturbing and revealing book here, which basically says
that the days of the House of Sa'ud are numbered, and when it goes, so does our
dependable oil supply.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Baer says that the Saudi royal family is paying off the terrorists and extreme
Islamic fundamentalists to keep them from attacking the royal family, but that is
an &quot;end game&quot; &#8212; only a matter of buying time while the terrorist
organizations grow richer and more powerful, and the non-royal population of
the country becomes poorer and increasingly dissatisfied with the extravagant
profligate behavior of the <i>thousands</i> of high-living Saudi princes.
Baer says that there are 30,000 royals in Saudi Arabia, and they have
a population explosion problem: each prince has a dozen or two wives,
and many have 50 to 70 children, and all of the royal children expect and demand a
life of opulent luxury while the common people can't even get a job.
At that birth rate, in another generation, there could be many hundreds of thousands
of royals for the oil dole to support &#8212; and the money has actually already run out.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The hey-day when Saudi Arabia had more money than sand is gone. Now they are borrowing
money to keep the circus going.  Sooner or later, the situation will
become unstable and blow up. And Baer shows us many reasons why the time will
probably be sooner than later.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And yes, the money that financed the 9/11 attacks on the USA came from Saudi Arabia.
And the Washington politicians know it, or should know it,
but they are too busy taking big campaign contributions and other huge payoffs
from the Saudis to make a fuss about the situation in Saudi Arabia &#8212;
&quot;sleeping with the devil&quot;. But the times they are a'changin'.<br>

<i>Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Anonymous
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#9F0000">(His real name is Mike Shoyer &#8212; he later
broke his anonymity.)</font><br>
Brassey's Inc., Washington, D.C., 2004.<br>
ISBN: 1-57488-849-8<br>
LC: HV6432.I47 2004<br>
Dewey: 973.931 I3445 2004 or 973.931&#8212;dc22<br>
A fascinating and disturbing book. The author, a CIA agent who prefered
to remain anonymous, makes a very good case for the USA being in big trouble
because of arrogance, ignorance, and stupidity in the highest offices.
He says that we do not clearly see our enemies because we insist on stereotyping
them and seeing them through Western eyes, rather than on their own terms.
What we call suicide bombers they call heroes who are going straight to Heaven.
The author says that our conduct of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is so incompetent
and unrealistic that defeat is inevitable &#8212; that in Afghanistan, it has already happened.
Monumental hubris and insane arrogance led American leaders to think that
they could easily defeat, with just a few troops, a little precision bombing,
and a short war, the very Afghani freedom fighters who had just defeated the Soviet Army.
The Soviets had already learned the hard way that it isn't that easy,
but the arrogant Washington neo-Cons didn't listen, look, or learn.
This is a good book for those who are interested in current politics and the
&quot;war on terrorism&quot;.<br>

<i>The End of Affluence; The Causes and Consequences of America's
Economic Dilemma</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeffrey Madrick<br>
Random House, New York, 1995.<br>
ISBN: 0-679-43623-5<br>
LC: HC106.7.M27 1995<br>
Dewey: 330.973092&#8212;dc20<br>
LCCN: 95-19946<br>
A fascinating book. The author shows how our real rate of economic growth,
after correcting for inflation,
has been depressed and below average since 1973. From 1820 to 1973,
the USA enjoyed an economic growth rate of around 4% per year,
even after averaging in the great depressions, but the author believes that
those heady days are gone forever. The Wild West is gone,
the buffalo are gone, the free land, oil, and trees are gone,
and the possibility of great rapid growth is gone.<br>

<i>The Long Emergency: Surviving the Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty-first Century</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; James Howard Kunstler<br>
Atlantic Monthly Press; an imprint of Grove/Atlantic, Inc., New York, 2005.<br>
ISBN: 0-87113-888-3<br>
LC: TP355.K86 2005<br>
Dewey: 303.4973&#8212;dc22<br>
A great and frightening book. Describes the immense problems &#8212; converging disasters &#8212;
that will befall us in the next 30 years or so:
<p>
<ol>
<li> the end of cheap oil and the Oil Age (and the depletion of natural gas, too).
Saudi Arabia is running out of oil. So is everybody else.
<li> failure of agribusiness because of no cheap oil and no insecticides or fertilizers;
hence, great food shortages and famine
<li> how alternative energy sources like wind, hydroelectric, and solar aren't
enough to save us, and how hydrogen is not an energy source (it's a storage device,
like a rechargeable battery)
<li> coal and nuclear power pollute and poison, and projects like the extraction of oil
from oil sands and shale are pipe dreams that will produce only a little bit of
expensive oil while using up too much precious fresh water and horribly polluting the territory.
<li> the end of the era of antibiotics &#8212; horrible new superbugs are immune to antibiotics
&#8212; and
the rise of superdiseases like AIDS and new influenzas. We are also slowly being invaded
by things like the West Nile Virus. (We may even be cursed with outbreaks of
exotic germs like the Congolese hemhoragic fevers &#8212; Ebola, Marburg Virus, Zaire virus &#8212;
and without gasoline, we will have a hard time getting ahead of them.)

<li> global warming and pollution damaging the ecosphere and causing climate change
<li> great water shortages causing the end of irrigation &#8212;
the Ogallala Aquifer and the Manzanita Aquifer and others are going dry
just like how the oil fields are going dry, because they getting sucked dry.
It will take many thousands of years to refill those aquifers.
<li> crop failures because of the collapse of the ecosphere, climate change,
and abuse of the land with chemicals, and water shortages, and so, more famine
<li> how most large cities will become death-traps, and you can't farm your back yard in Phoenix
or Los Angeles (especially not when the electricity fails and the pumps can't pump water
to your house)
<li> collapse of the &quot;hallucinated economy&quot; because the current system is
simply unsustainable &#8212; it's just a mountain of debt supported by nothing but more borrowing.
The current U.S. Government is just running a Ponzi scheme, borrowing ever more money
to pay off older debts while running up even more debts.
It is physically impossible for that to continue forever.
When the Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese feel the need to cash in their
U.S. Government T-bills (to buy more of that expensive oil),
the dollar and the U.S. economy are done for. (So what will we buy Saudi oil with? Euros?
We don't have any.)
<li> the burst of the housing bubble &#8212; will take down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and a lot
more of our financial institutions, too.
<li> collapse of our whole economic and industrial infrastructure because of all of
the above
<li> All of our factories have been dismantled and sold to places like China, so
we won't even be able to manufacture our own bicycle tires in the future
&quot;New World Order&quot;. (Thank you Walmart.)
Rebuilding our industrial base without any oil or gasoline to fuel the
rebuilding will be extremely difficult and slow.
<li> The process of collapse will be chaotic and anarchic, not an orderly rearrangement
of society. Governments will prove ineffective and incapable of dealing
with the overwhelming problems, and many governments will become irrelevant
relics, or disband entirely.
</ol>

<p>
About the only ones the author forgot to mention are:<br>
<ol>
<li>
The loss of the honey bees because of the Varoa Mites, and the
resulting loss of crops which require bee pollination, which is immense:
everything from almonds to zuchini.<br>
<li>
Collapse of the world's fisheries because of over-fishing and pollution of the
oceans. This one is already here.
That will in turn contribute to world-wide protein shortages.<br>
<li>
Invasion of the coastlines around the world with <i>Calerpa taxifolia</i>,
the toxic seaweed that is currently destroying the Mediterranean, and which has
already traveled to Australia and San Diego, California. It was originally a tropical
plant that could not survive in the cooler Mediterranean, but it seems to have
mutated in people's aquariums and turned into a plant that can now tolerate cooler waters,
while its natural enemy, a tiny sea slug that eats it, cannot.
<i>Calerpa taxifolia</i> is quite toxic and inedible by anything other than that little slug.
<i>Calerpa taxifolia</i> densely covers everything on the sea floor
and totally displaces all of the native plants, producing a marine &quot;green desert&quot;
without any fish or other wildlife, because no animals can find anything to eat.
That will put the last nail in the coffin of the world's fisheries.
</ol>
<p>
What is really frustrating is the way that our whole society, from our
political leaders on down to the
man on the street, are just playing ostrich and ignoring the problems.
But if we don't deal with those problems and soon, then Mother Nature will,
by eliminating the excess human population &#8212;
about 5 billion people or so &#8212; through starvation, diseases, and wars.
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse will ride again.

<i>Seeing Like a State; How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; James C. Scott<br>
Yale University Press, New Haven CN and London, 1998.<br>
ISBN: 0-300-07016-0 (cloth: alk. paper), 0-300-07815-3 (pbk. alk. paper)<br>
LC: HD87.5.S365 1998<br>
Dewey: 338.9&#8212;dc21 or 338.9 SCOTT<br>
LCCN: 97-26556<br>
Studies many examples of bad planning by states, and reveals an interesting conflict:
states want systems which can be easily governed and taxed, even if they don't work well.
Given a choice between free-roaming nomads or organized plantations, the states choose
the organization most every time. (Witness the destruction of free-roaming native American
peoples in the USA.) In Malaysia, free-roaming rubber harvesters who worked as hunter-gatherers,
gleaning wild rubber, were far more cost-effective than the rubber plantations which
the Europeans established at great expense, and which were prone to failure from
diseases because of over-crowding of the rubber trees.
But those free wanderers were impossible to govern, and difficult to tax, so the
state chose to create more plantations.<br>
The author also explores the arrogance of political leaders who imagine that they know
what is good for the common people, without bothering to talk to the common people.
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin is his first example.
