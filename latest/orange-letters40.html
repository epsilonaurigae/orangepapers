From:  	&quot;Deviant Boys&quot;<br>

<p>

As a younger alcoholic in search of help, i must tell you, that i have
always been suspect of AA, and its religious base, (i dont believe in
god or in any &quot;higher power&quot;), yet the question i have, and have
searched your site for is, what are the good alternatives to stopping by
yourself? like, do you know of any reputable organizations that arent
faith based? or cultish?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Devi,
<p>
Yes, I was just answering that same question a few minutes ago, in another
letter.
<p>
First off, the list of links and contacts that I gave to that other correspondent
is
<a href="orange-letters39.html#noncult_links" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
And then see the page of links,
<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
I rearranged it so that the non-cult recovery and self-help groups are all listed
right at the top of the page, mostly in alphabetical order.
<p>
You should be able to contact some good people through those links.
<p>
Have a good day, and good luck.

Subject:  	Thankyou<br>

<p>

I found A.A. on my own about 6 years ago.  At first I believed all the
self-righteous spewing and confessions I heard because I thought the
outfit was legit... boy was I wrong... recently I had the nerve to
challenge an aquaintance of mine at one of the meetings.  I said look,
I've known you for years and when did you do all the terrible acts you
are speaking of?  With an evil grin and smugness on his face he said
&quot;Look we are all just a bunch of drunks and evildooers here, all of
us!&quot;  And another one of them said &quot;We all have a part in the world's
misery.&quot;  So I say HORSEFEATHERS, I'm outta there, and thanks to your
excellent piece of work on the internet I am even more convinced it's
for ever!  Some of the worst lying and verbal harassement I've ever
heard has been at those meetings!  And who needs it!

Subject:  	Some questions...<br>

<p>

You have obviously put a lot of time and effort into this research on AA.
I  have recovered using the 12 steps. I am curious, what brought on this
passionate distaste for AA? Would you feel the same about AA, if Bill
and Bob were regarded as just another pair of drunks whose opinion held
no more wieght than any other's? I can understand the distaste for AA
meetings and the feeling that there is too much religion, because that
is my opinion as well. Thanks for the information on the website.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Dan,
<p>
Thanks for the question.
<p>
It isn't just any one thing; it's everything from Bill and Bob pushing Frank Buchman's
cult religion as a quack cure for alcoholism,
to the coercive recruiting, to the lying about the A.A. failure rate,
to A.A. trying to suppress research into better recovery programs.
<p>

I summarized my objections to A.A. on the web page

From:  	&quot;J B&quot; <br>
Subject:  	What worries me...<br>

<p>

...slightly, is the effect of years of brainwashing has on people.  I am out of AA now
for a good six months (thanks, mostly, to your work) and still I experience states
of chronic self doubt, confusion, and a sense of being out of control (non of which
I had before AA).  Alcoholism is a horrendous way of life.  AA is a horrendous way
to recover.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, James, glad to hear that you are doing well. And thanks for the compliment.
</font>
<p>

On this subject, I have noticed there is a split, kinda, between the &quot;therapy based
12 steppers&quot; and the hard-line dogmatic big book Nazis.  The therapy people are more
concerned about feelings, inner child's, &quot;spirituality&quot;, and a kind of mystical
style &#8212; whilst the big book Nazis play hard and fast by the Big Book.  Of course a
wild generalisation, but what I feel harmed me more than anything was the whole deep
and sickly moral aspect of AA.  I can remember doing a step four and nearly every
negative emotion I had, be it fear or sadness etc, was somehow turned into
&quot;selfishness&quot;.  Shyness and anxiety became &quot;pride&quot;, and that people with small egos
didn't get afraid because their expectations were so low.  So, in other words
whenever I felt afraid, annoyed, anxious, etc I blamed myself internally, what I
thought of as human characteristics  were now &quot;defects&quot; and a waking great ego.  Can
you imagine going to a good shrink and him telling you that your panic attacks are
caused by your &quot;big ego&quot;??.  So, realising how disgusting I was (by Wilson's
criteria) I found it easier to surrender to God, letting my reasoning skills go, and
become more and more robotic and confused.

<p>

It has been my observation that those who treat it like a therapy group, the
Bradshaw branch if you like, do not get harmed by the true nature of Wilson's
message.  They simply deny that something fishy is going on when Wilson is waxing
lyrical about morals, defects, will etc.  Where as the hardliners know exactly what
&quot;ego deflation&quot; is, and how defective we alcoholics are.

<p>

My ego was deflated in AA, and to be honest it wasn't pleasant.  Each day I have to
work my self through the confusion and the beliefs that were somehow implanted in my
mind by &quot;letting go&quot;.  People go in to AA for self help &#8212; they do so to try and help
themselves.  Each one of them is virtuous for that reason.  And six months down the
line they have been completely and utterly brainwashed, their freedom restricted,
their world horrifically narrowed.  It makes me sick.

<p>

I really want to loose my anger I have toward that group.  Ever since I have left I
feel as they have trampled all over my inner most self.  A violation.  I say if
people want to join a cult to get sober, so be it; but for fucks sake drop the
deception, the outright lies, the &quot;moral crusade&quot; on suffering alcoholics.  Of
course AA should exist &#8212; but it should be group whose members have chosen to be
there, who have said:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;ohhh religious conversion and strong dogma, that's for me&quot;</font>!
It makes me sick and I want to forget about the whole fucking thing.

<p>

Keep going Orange.  And stay sober.  Some of them have a vested interest in seeing
us &quot;dry drunks&quot; drink again and die.

<p>

The Shadow.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are absolutely right &#8212; I couldn't agree more.
They have a $6.2 billion/year vested interest, just in the USA.
There is plenty of good money to be made by selling an old cult religion to the drunks
and druggies.
<p>
I am doing great, I am happy to say. You take care of yourself too, and have a good day.

<p>

Dear Orange &#8212;

<p>

I believe that if you need to stop substance abuse, you stop.  I did just
that &#8212;  stop.
<p>
No one can do it for you.  AA can not do it; AA cannot even help.  AA does
not want to help.
<p>
SMART can help.  SMART can help get your act together; can help you solve
your problems.  The folks at SMART seem to be a more caring group.

<p>

To me, AA is not a caring group. They seem to be a group of strangers, and
the trust is absent.  I went to AA for a while, after I quit, and I was glad
it was anonymous.  I did not want those people to know anything about me.

<p>

I suggest that the medical profession concentrate on two things:  Developing
medication which deters alcohol consumption.  Second, that the medical
profession concentrate on therapies to solve mental/emotional problems after
the client patient has stopped.  &quot;Dual Diagnosis&quot; is commonplace and is
&quot;tough&quot;.

<p>

Most certainly realize that 12 step is iatrogenic.

<p>

Date:  	Tue, March 21, 2006 15:39<br>
From:  	&quot;Howard W.&quot; 

<p>

Dear Orange:

<p>

I do think that AA uses the vulnerability of people to recruit members.
That seems quite obvious to me.

<p>

Also, I think that the substance abuse treatment business is very cynical.
Logic dictates that the industry is well aware that AA is selling snake oil;
the industry must know &#8212; how can it be ignorant? &#8212; that 12 step is
iatrogenic.  It appears that substance abuse treatment is a profit center.

<p>

The court system, it seems to me, uses AA as an alternative to
incarceration.  Incarceration is expensive; and, in most places,
overcrowded.   AA does not object to this; the rooms are filled.

<p>

And, substance abuse treatment facilities do have desparate and vulnerable
people.  They make good candidates for membership in AA.

<p>

Fortunately for me, I was not that desparate and vulnerable to believe the
drivel of AA.  I knew that &quot;denial&quot; was crude emotional blackmail.  I quit
abusing on my own.

<p>

Having been to AA, and found it wanting [to be kind], I became curious
about those who do not stay.  I understand 95% are gone in a year.

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1.  Why do they leave?
<li> 2.  What do coerced attendees think about AA?
<li> 3. 
<a href="orange-letters40.html#LauriJean" target="_blank">Why do the small number who stay, stay?</a>

<li> 4.  Why do people in substance abuse treatment, who ought to know better,
continue to enable AA?  Are they co dependent?  Are they cynical?  Do they
believe that drunks and druggies are unworthy of competent treatment?
Perhaps the notion that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is a disease is fictive.
</ul>

<p>
I have actually been told that programs like SMART are too complicated and
mental.  Alcoholics would never understand it.  Also, alcoholics need AA
because their lives are wrecked and they need the refuge of AA to survive.
Very cynical and defeatist.

<p>
I appreciate your work.  Vaya con dios

<p>

Howard W

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Howard,
<p>
And thanks again for the compliments.
<p>
Taking the last item first, the A.A. claim that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;SMART is too complicated and mental&quot;</font>,
the funny thing is that I was told the very same thing
about &quot;<a href="orange-intro.html#AVRT" target="_blank">Addictive Voice Recognition Therapy</a>&quot;
by my cocaine-snorting child-molesting 12-Step counselor.
Apparently everything is too intellectual and complicated for the A.A. true believers.

<p>
I'm also beginning to suspect that the treatment industry is very cynical.
They know what is going on. I have spoken with a few really good-hearted counselors
and program managers, and they despair of the horrendous failure rate.
<p>
It's like the woman who told me that I was
<a href="orange-letters26.html#only1left" target="_blank">the only one left</a>
who had not relapsed out
of my whole class of over 100 people. She was not happy to be telling me that &#8212;
she wasn't happy with the program's failure rate &#8212;
but she was happy that I was still making it. She cares.
<p>
But a lot of her co-workers either don't care or are in denial about the worthlessness
of the program.
<p>
Or worse yet, they seem to just regard the relapsers with contempt,
and claim that it's the fault of those darned addicts if they don't do it right.
<p>
That's just another example of blame-shifting, of course.
The programs don't need to work at
all if it's just the addicts' and alcoholics' fault when they relapse.

<p>
About your other questions &#8212; why do they leave?<br>
That's easy &#8212; they don't like it.
<p>
And the coerced people hate it. When they can, they show up at SMART meetings
grumbling about the nutcases over in A.A. meetings.

<p>
The ones who stay are the most interesting. We were just discussing that question
in
<a href="orange-letters40.html#types" target="_blank">a previous letter</a>,
so click on that link to go there.
<p>
And item 4 is the toughest one. I suspect that a lot of people have a lot
of different motives and feelings and beliefs:
<p>
<ol>
<li> But it's really good for some people. I've seen <i>some</i> people recover.

<li> It's all we've got.

<li> It's cheap.

<li> It gets the drunks and the druggies praying.
<li> It's better than nothing.

<li> Those A.A. fanatics will make a lot of trouble and raise unholy hell if we
don't include them in the treatment program.

<li> We might lose funding if we don't please the A.A. groups by sending patients to them,
and endorsing 12-Step recovery.
<a href="orange-action.html" target="_blank">Congressman Jim Ramstad has a finger in
the pie</a>, and controls funding.
</ol>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Another thought ...<br>

<p>

Dear A. Orange:

<p>

You have put a great deal of energy into writing your Snake Oil page
about the 12 Steps.  I'm sure your ego has you convinced that you need
to &quot;help&quot; others, but the reality is that it is your ego which, being
threatened by the 12 steps, is in need of help.  I hope you find the
help you need, and in whatever form you find it, I rejoice for you.

<p>

Sincerely,<br>
M. L. H.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Marsha,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You know, that is just such typical cultish nonsense &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;your ego... being threatened by the 12 Steps...&quot;</font>

<p>
Do you even know what ego is? Let's look at a few dictionary definitions of
the word,
<a href="orange-definitions.html#ego2" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Random House says 'the &quot;I&quot; or self of any person'.<br>
Webster's says 'the self esp. as inside one as contrasted with something
outside'.
<p>
Now how would I feel &quot;threatened&quot; by
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the 12 cult religion practices of Frank Buchman</a>
that Alcoholics Anonymous promotes?
<p>
Only in the same way as I might feel threatened by a loaded gun pointed at me,
or somebody intending to do me harm.
<p>
But you are trying to imply that the 12 Steps are something good, and that
I should be happy to surrender my mind and my will to your cult, and that there
is something wrong with my morality or my mind if I don't approve of your
cultish beliefs.
<p>
The 12 Steps are not good things or good practices.
<p>
What I find most curious is that you were reading the page on
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">12-Step Snake Oil</a> before writing to complain.
That web page criticizes the 12-Step cult for shoving guilt-inducing practices on
abused children and raped women. How on earth do you make the illogical leap
from me criticizing cult practices that harm those victims further,
to you imagining that my &quot;ego&quot; feels threatened?
<p>
Talk about an illogical leap. Care to explain your thinking?
<p>
Do you really believe that inducing guilt in abused children, raped women,
and sick schizophrenics is a good thing to do?
<p>
How about charging people money to treat a non-existent disease like
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="_blank">codependency</a>&quot;?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;keneth d.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	i appreciate this criticism of this cult.<br>

<p>
aa and all 12-step concepts are quackery; and it essentially admits
that.  I have no opposition, strictly, on religious grounds or on
disbelief of supernatural deities; it is clear that 12-step concepts in
and of themselves, redefine &quot;god&quot; or the &quot;higher power&quot; as extremely
limited in either goodness or power or both.. Among all the other flaws
of this sickening cult , this is one of the major fallacies.  Regardless
of a a final outcome, to me, it seems totally illogical to direct a
prayer to &quot;higher power&quot; or deity indicating that &quot;I want to learn to
accept an intolerable 'thorn in my flesh'&quot;. This isn't a logical
definition of god.
<p>
This cult organization has also created professional
employment discrimination and has subtly (and maybe overtly) limited
scientific investigation.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Keneth,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I couldn't agree more.
<p>
I don't know if you have read the web page on
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>,
but that was one of my objections too &#8212; they
twist God into one very weird unholy creature who tortures you with alcohol
to get you to grovel before him. That sounds more Satanic than Godly.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	what happened to moderation. thanks for website<br>
Date:  	Thu, March 16, 2006 13:59<br>

<p>

It's awfully strange that no one (hardly) in medical science community
or in the field of psychology, etc. ever does serious study on the use
of moderation training for a person who has been a problem drinker;  i
think this is directly and indirectly related to the cult movement
(AA).  If a person drinks too much and suffers the negative effects (in
their variety of forms), they develop a &quot;failure identity&quot;.  And this
negative identity is maintained by repeated over-drinking.  Also a
continuing long period of total abstinence perpetuates the &quot;failure
identity&quot;. This represents a double-bind or avoidance-avoidance type of
conflict..  The individual sees other people drinking a beverage and
apparently avoiding excessive problems. But feels that he or she cannot
for whatever strong and unknown reasons. Only logical solution: have
strategies, and behavioral change which facilitate &quot;learning to be a
moderate drinker.&quot; If AA and AA concepts had been magic bullets they
would have put themselves out of business.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yep. I just couldn't agree more. But instead of A.A. putting itself out of business,
the problem has gotten worse.
<ol>
<li> 
Around 1948, Ms. Marty Mann told Congress that there might be 100,000 alcoholics
in the USA.
<li>
In 1969,
<a href="orange-Bill_Senate.html#millions" target="_blank">Bill Wilson testified before the U.S. Senate</a>
that there might be 5 million alcoholics in the USA.
<li>
Now, after 70 years of A.A. fixing the problem, we have an estimated
20 or 30 million.

From:  	&quot;keneth d.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	A.A. Mind Control<br>

<p>

This seems to be an ultimate example of mind control; scare tactics.  A
powerful example of this comes from text in one of the main A.A.
publications.  A story is told of a man who had never touched alcohol in
25 years after previous over-drinking in his life.. Well in the
intellectual prose of the writers&quot;out came the slippers&quot; when he retired
from work. And down the drain he went.
<p>
This is a form of mind control
attempts with the use of scare tactics for the concerned individual
studying this program. The individual's unconscious mind essentially is
saying &quot;yep and that'll probably happen to me, because i'm like this
man&quot;. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, indeed.
<p>
Thanks for this website.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Keneth,
<p>
Thanks again.
<p>
And you are quite right.
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank">Phobia Induction</a>&quot;
&#8212; aka &quot;implanting fears&quot; &#8212; is a standard part of the process of converting
a newcomer into a true believer in a cult religion. Making them afraid to leave
makes it easier to keep them around. Eventually, phobia induction even
makes the victims afraid to think the wrong thoughts, or else bad things
might happen.
<p>
And
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">A.A. does it</a>
just as much as the Moonies or Scientology.
<p>
The story to which you are referring is in chapter 3 of the <i>Big Book</i>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking. He was very
nervous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with more
liquor. He was ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would
get nowhere if he drank at all. Once he started, he had no control whatever.
He made up his mind that until he had been successful in business and
had retired, he would not touch another drop. An exceptional man, he
remained bone dry for twenty-five years and retired at the age of fifty-five,
after a successful and happy business career. Then he fell victim to a
belief which practically every alcoholic has that his long period of
sobriety and self-discipline had qualified him to drink as other men.
Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle. In two months he was in a
hospital, puzzled and humiliated. He tried to regulate his drinking for
a little while, making several trips to the hospital meantime.
Then, gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop altogether and
found he could not. Every means of solving his problem which money
could buy was at his disposal. Every attempt failed. Though a robust
man at retirement, he went to pieces quickly and was dead within four
years.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>'The Big Book', Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, pages 32-33.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the moral of the story is supposed to be that you can't ever recover from
alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This case contains a powerful lesson. most of us have believed that if
we remained sober for a long stretch, we could thereafter drink normally.
But here is a man who at fifty-five years found he was just where he had
left off at thirty. We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again:
&quot;Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.&quot; Commencing to drink
after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. If we
are planning to stop drinking , there must be no reservation of any kind,
nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>'The Big Book', Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 33.</font>
</blockquote>

Now I agree that quitting drinking and staying quit is a good thing to do.
<p>
But Bill Wilson declared that you can't quit drinking without Alcoholics
Anonymous, in spite of the fact the guy in the story did just that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
Young people may be encouraged by this man's experience to think that
they can stop, as he did, on their own will power. We doubt if many of
them can do it, because none will really want to stop, and hardly one
of them, because of the peculiar mental twist already acquired, will
find he can win out. Several of our crowd, men of thirty or less, had
been drinking only a few years, but they found themselves as helpless
as those who had been drinking twenty years.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>'The Big Book', Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 33.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So you are powerless over alcohol and doomed. Better go join a cult.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Another system<br>

<p>

Dear AO:
<p>
Why, in all of this time has someone not formed a less superstitious
program for people who are recovering alcoholics.  I mean one that would
have meetings.  People, especially in the beginning, do need a lot of
support.
<p>
I know of RR but nobody else but the 12step groups has an ongoing
involvement program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi SBT,
<p>
It's a done deal.
They have formed non-cult groups. SMART and WFS seem to be the most

<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">the links page</a>.
</ul>


<p>
RR is folded, gone, because Jack Trimpey decided that meetings were
superfluous and obsolete.
Plenty of other people, including me, disagree. What happened was most of the
RR facilitators and leaders just moved sideways over into SMART, so
now SMART is the going thing. But WFS is rapidly become more popular with the
women, too.

<p>
In general, your question about why the non-cult self-help groups are so few and
far between, and the 12-Step groups are so many, is due to two reasons:
<ol>
<li> A.A. had a 70-year head start.
<li> A.A. is a cult. Cults grow exponentially. Cults expend a lot of energy trying
to get new members. SMART and other sane self-help groups are more concerned with
helping people. SMART even says that the day will come when you have learned everything
that it has to offer, so you will just walk out the door and get on with your life.
Cults do just the opposite: they say that you can't ever leave, and you must spend all of
your spare time recruiting and producing new converts.
</ol>

<p>
Asking why A.A. is so much bigger than SMART also reminds me of a question like,
&quot;Why does cancer grow so much faster than normal tissue?&quot;
<p>
The answer is, &quot;Because that's what a cancer does. Growth for the sake of growth
is the morality of a cancer cell.&quot; It is also the morality of cults.
</font>
<p>

I think that some of it is so ridiculous.  Anyone with a mind gets up
and leaves.  It's a one size fits all and they put down any dissenters
or people who bring any new breeze to their tired old rap.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Agreed. Most people,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">95% or more of them</a>,
vote with their feet and walk out.
</font>
<p>

Do you think that there is a chance for someone to start another no cost
group that could grow like AA or is it a waste of time?

<p>
<font color="blue">
It's done. See the links page.
</font>
<p>

The &quot;disease&quot; concept, the &quot;powerless&quot; concept,
the &quot;HP&quot; concept and the
others are so ridiculous.  What does paying your debts and saying you
are sorry to your ex brother in law have to do with staying sober?  It
is beyond moronic and produces zombies.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Agreed.
</font>
<p>

There are people out there who have conquered the dragon and left AA and
can really help but there is nothing else that is organized.  Any ideas?
Also, many drug addicts go to AA because they think NA is &quot;too rough.&quot;
Also many pill heads sit in meetings with skid row dope fiends.  They
sit there saying &quot;we are all the same.  It's all about feelings.&quot;  What
horsehockey.
<p>
I don't want to get off the beaten path here.  Do you think there is
hope for an offshoot that would be less culty?  Just like a cancer
survivor's group or something like that?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Cheer up. It exists.
</font>
<p>

Advise and thanks for your site.
<p>
I remember reading it after my first AA exposure and I was hysterical.
It's not funny but the dark truth usually can be so.

<p>

Sincerely,<br>
SBT

<p>

Hi SBT,

Thanks for the letter. And cheer up, the situation is actually improving.

From:  	&quot;john m.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Curious<br>

<p>

I am curious; if someone commits suicide, while they are sober, can we
honestly say that they died sober? Also, if someone dies of an over-dose
of heroine, can we say that they died sober, since they did not drink alcohol?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Those are good questions. It really depends on your definition of the word &quot;sober&quot;.
<p>
I prefer to use the narrow definition, and just interpret &quot;sober&quot; to mean that
someone has no alcohol in him. So the heroin addict would be sober but stoned out
of his gourd on smack. You could say that he's sober but not straight.

<p>
A.A., on the other hand, likes to expand &quot;sobriety&quot; to mean that someone is going
to A.A. meetings, doing the 12 Steps, etc., which I find ridiculous.

<a name="suicides"> </a>
The death toll while I was in AA for six years, in Reno, Nevada:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Total of five unintentional overdoses, that I knew about. Two were
heroin, the others were sleeping pills, pain pills, or vallium.

<p><li>
Total of seven overt suicides of people that attended meetings, my first
two years of sobriety. The first four, they intentionally took drugs and
alcohol for the purpose of ending their life. One shot himself in the
head, the other hung himself, because they continued to get in debt,
after sobriety, because of their gambling. The last (I have forgotten
his name) put the hose in the exhaust and put it into the back window
of his truck. Had no drugs or alcohol from the time he started going
to meetings, went to meetings on a regular basis. Unfortunately, he got
lonely and depressed. None of the women in AA or NA would have any thing
to do with him. These women prefered the hip slick and cool
pontificator that was not really sober, but fit in with their image
of the ideal man.

<p><li>
The above does not even count the deaths that we never heard about.

</ul>
<p>
I suppose that AA could work, if it was done the way that it was
intended, but unfortunately, most there have another agenda, and it is
not helping others to stay sober.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Bummer. That's a lot of suicides. But it doesn't surprise me.
Suicides have been a constant subject in the letters coming in here.
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">Look here</a>
for a list of suicides in the letters that have come in.

<p><br>
Telling people that they are hopeless and defective and sinful and disgusting
and can't ever recover is bound to make some people very depressed and suicidal.
<p>
And Bill Wilson did it to people deliberately. This is Bill's recruiting
manual in the <i>Big Book</i>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
If you are satisfied that he is a real alcoholic, begin to dwell on the
hopeless feature of the malady. Show him, from your own experience, how
the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal
functioning of the will power.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Maybe you have disturbed him about the question of
alcoholism. This is all to the good. The more hopeless he feels,
the better. He will be more likely to follow your suggestions.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 94.</font>

<p>

Oh yeh, make them despair of their very lives and maybe you can
manipulate them into the cult.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

[2nd letter from John:]
<p>


Date:  	Wed, March 22, 2006 22:27<br>
From:  	&quot;john m.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: Curious<br>

<p>

Actually, I was just being sarcastic (except for the statistics of my
own observations). There is still small &quot;skirmishes&quot; in AA, about
talking about drugs. I just wanted to make the point, that there is
still the belief in AA, that if you die without alcohol in your body,
then you are 'sober'.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, okay. I just can't help but find that legalistic argument amusing.
I guess I'm quick to bite on that hook.
</font>
<p>

One thing that I used to suggest to the people that I sponsored (or a
better word I use is indoctrinate), was that they get a physical, and
stay away from the vitamin peddlers in AA. I think that that is one of
the few things that I did that was good for new comers.

<p>

I never told anyone to stop doctor prescribed meds. I did not present
myself as an expert in alcoholism. Instead, I was just their friend, or
confidant. It is still possible to help a problem drinker. I never tried
to detox a person I was helping myself. I AM NOT A DOCTOR!

<p>

Yet, there were many old timers that 'implied' that they knew better
than ministers, physicians, and psychiatric professionals. This is one
of the many reasons that I left AA.

<p>

As for 13th stepping. I was one of the guys in AA, that women in
recovery avoided like the plague.

<p>

AA has turned into sub-groups of special interest 'support' groups, such
as the (I am being sarcastic with the following, but I think the readers
will get the message I am trying to convey) 'all men are evil/lesbo
recruiting group'.

<p>

I got fed up with new comers being told not to start taking care of
themselves, by eating healthy, quit smoking, and exercise. Instead, they
were encouraged to do the AA communion of chain smoking cigarrettes
(preferably none filtered), guzzle black coffee, suppress your sex urge,
and say every thing is great, even if you have to make it up.

<p>

Just before I got into AA, my wife kicked me out, she left with my
children, and got remarried again (how dare she get on with her life!).
At my 5th year of sobriety, I was suicidal. rather that 'consulting' my
sponsor, I went to the local VA Hospital, spent a week on the psych
ward, and started going to therapy. I was fortunate, in that I found a
therapist that was neutral about AA. I did not discover my inner child,
but discovered that I was very immature for my age, and that I was a
very dependent person, no matter if it was religious cults, 12 step
groups, or relatives that tolerated my sponging off of them. In other
words, I had to grow up, take responsibility for my actions, and start
living life. I went to my last AA meeting in 2003, and I have not looked
back since. I now own a house, property, chickens, goats, a dog and a
cat. I am now married again to a beautiful lady. And oh yeah, I now have
10+ years without illegal drugs, alcohol, or tobacco.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, John,
<p>
Thanks for the follow-up, and congratulations on your 10 years.
Life is just so much better when you aren't addicted, isn't it?
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;LauriJean H.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	but why?<br>

<p>

I completely agree (well, no, I don't because I have my own thoughts
that vary here and there, but just for argument's sake...) with your
&quot;interpretations...&quot;  BUT I'm left with this glaring, difficult,
challenging question:

<p>

Why? What's to be gained? AA isn't a profit-making organization... of
what value is it to continue propagating itself?  Is it just a numbers
game? Bragging rights?  Am I missing something?  Help me with this
question, please?  I have a loved one in AA and have brought up many of
the issues you detail &#8212; but do want him to grow and &quot;recover&quot; into a life
without alcohol (or at least without the life-threatening effects).  But
I have been greatly repelled by the energy in the room and concepts in
Al-Anon and CoDA, etc...

<p>

Any ideas?  Thank you.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi LauriJean,
<p>
Thanks for the question. It's a good one. And yes, I have lots of ideas.

<p>
There are actually several answers to your question. It depends on which A.A. members
we are talking about.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
First off, we have the rank and file A.A. members. They are not in it for the money.
They may be in it for any of several other reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A genuine desire for sobriety.

<p>
<li> Ego gratification and delusions of grandeur:
<ul>
<li>
&quot;I am a member of the in-crowd.
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="_blank">I am special</a>.

<li>
&quot;I am hip to the innermost wisdom of recovery.
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea" target="_blank">We have the panacea</a>.&quot;

<li>
&quot;I have a special relationship with God. I have a guaranteed
ticket to Heaven. God loves me so much more now that I am not drinking alcohol.&quot;

<li>
&quot;But I still have to go recruit 10 more newbies in order to be really holy and
spiritual, and then I have to go to a zillion more meetings to indoctrinate them.
That will be very pleasing to Higher Power, me getting Him more followers.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
<li> Fear of death:
&quot;If I leave A.A., I will relapse and die drunk in a gutter. That's what everybody here
says. So I'd better play it safe and keep coming back to meetings.&quot;<br>
&quot;Besides, I don't need to fear death because I have a hotline to Heaven.&quot;<br>
&quot;But if I quit A.A., I will lose my ticket to Heaven.&quot;

<p>
<li> Desire to be right:
&quot;Don't tell me that the 12-Step theology is bullshit and that I wasted 10 years of
my life in a cult. That can't be true. I'm not that stupid.&quot;

<p><li> Loneliness. It's a social club.
<p><li> A feeling of being appreciated or of being &quot;loved&quot;.

<p><li> And then there is the mistaken belief that A.A. actually works and is necessary
for maintaining sobriety.

<p><li> And then there are the
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers" target="_blank">people who are
neurotic or downright insane</a>, and who
just fixate on A.A. meetings as an obsession. They do from one to three meetings per day.

<p><li>
Spiritual hunger.
Some people are starving for something, anything, that seems to be spiritual.
Their hunger seems to be some strange combination of spiritual longing and anxiety about death.
Women who suffer from this malady often turn into the &quot;church ladies&quot; who haunt
churches. (Remember the Beatles' song, &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;?)<br>
A.A. has such people too, and they are determined to believe that Bill Wilson was
a saint and a messenger from God, and the <i>Big Book</i> contains cosmic wisdom.

</ul>


<p>
<li> The Predators.<br>
These people are totally cynical, and are just out to get something.
<p>
The sexual predators use the meetings as meat markets. Newcomers are greedily eyed
as fresh meat. Both women and
<a href="orange-cult_a5.html#hpredator" target="_blank">attractive young men</a>
are targets.
<p>
Some predators are financial and con their victims out of all of the money they can get.
I was just reading a story about one guy who sequentially married older women A.A. members
and took them for every dollar they had, and then moved on to the next city
and another A.A. meeting and another victim. The anonymity of A.A. makes it easier to do.
<p>
Some predators are on an ego trip, and want to gather an entourage of slaves (sponsees)
who worship them as wise gurus.

<p>
The predators are quite happy to maintain the cult and recruit and make people believe
that A.A. really works, and they do a great job of
<a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor" target="_blank">appearing to be a wise,
compassionate and caring old-timers</a>,
even though lots of the predators don't even have a drug or
alcohol problem &#8212; they are just there for the sex or the money.
Likewise, lots of the predators are not sober, either, and they don't have years of
sobriety like they claim. They are merely good actors.

<p>
<li> The Executives.<br>
The members of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., make
$70,000 per year. I hear that the President of A.A. makes something like
$125,000 per year. Who would want to blow that cushy job that by
admitting that A.A. doesn't really work?
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<p>
<li> The Treatment Providers.<br>
Here is where the real money is. Treating alcoholics and drug addicts with the
12-Step cult religion is a $6.2 billion per year industry.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#TC_study" target="_blank">Ninety-three percent of
the treatment centers in the USA use the &quot;12-Step model&quot;</a>.
Who would want to end such a profitable game, and give up
billions of dollars, by admitting that 12-Step treatment doesn't work,
and is, in fact, just expensive fraud?
<br>
<font color="#7F0000">
UPDATE: In 2009, The New York Times printed an article that said that the recovery industry is
a $20 billion per year business in the USA.
</font>
</ol>

<p>
After writing out all of that, I remembered that I answered a similar question
a long time ago,
<a href="orange-letters3.html#why_cult" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
I hope that answers your question. I hope it hasn't given you nightmares.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

*I almost died laughing at the level of paranoia you present. Your
opening page is merely a sampling of what the reader is in for, ie; you
rambling on about how AOL and Yahoo are out to get you and your hallowed
works. My God. Do you really think you are that important?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Fat,
<p>
Paranoia? Umm, no. When Yahoo Geocities erases a whole web site and all of the
email that went to it without explanation or warning, that is a fact,
not paranoia.
<p>
Likewise, when AOL blocks all email that contains a certain URL, that is a fact,
not paranoia.

</font>
<p>


I bet you lay
awake at night tossing and turning in your Army surplus cot waiting for
the Men In Black to come busting through the pressed wood door on your
rental trailer to haul you off to some re-education camp in the
Catskills. I issue forth a good hearty laugh in your angry, red,
bloated face. *
<p>
<font color="blue">
How much do you want to bet? How much money do you have?
</font>
<p>


*    Another thing I noticed; you piss and moan about AA yet you
yourself say that you've relapsed on several occasions. I bet you're
chugging a bottle of Albertson's Brand Vodka as you read this mail at
some Kinko's at 2 am in the morning, cursing like a sailor and motioning
the clerk to come over so you drop another $5.99 to get 15 more minutes
on AOL to spew some more of your angry rhetoric at the world. Give it
rest, pal. Stop grinding that axe.*

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. You should learn how to read. I said that I relapsed once,
14 years ago, after 3 years of sobriety, and drank for 9 more years.
&quot;Once&quot; is not &quot;several occasions&quot;.
<p>
Again, you are saying &quot;I bet&quot;. Okay, I will take you up on the bet.
I can use a couple of new computers and a couple of new guitars.
Even a new house. How much money do you have?
</font>
<p>

*    Also, it's kind of hard to take you seriously. I mean one minute
you're hollering about how AA screwed you, then you're going off on how
Bush stole the election. Make up your mind, is this a book on how AA is
out to screw the world or is this book supposed to present a political
point? It's hard to tell the way you jump around from angry hissy fit to
another.                *

<p>
<font color="blue">
Unlike A.A. members, I do not hide from &quot;outside issues&quot;. The real world
is not an &quot;outside issue&quot;.
</font>
<p>

*     You misquote several items from the AA book. Not the items you
made footnotes on, you can get in trouble for that and since you think
Big Brother is scouring your works looking for anything that he can burn
with (uh, yes, that was sarcastic, but I bet you pat yourself on the
back thinking that you really have the MIB running in circles) but
plenty of items you have not covered with a footnote, ie; your hissy
fits, are at best, half truths (you know which ones they are).  How
convenient. And yes, I did some research to include reading the Big Book
along with several searches on the people you mentioned (Bill Wilson, Dr
Bob Wilson, etc etc), seems like a lot of your stories are just that,
stories or half truths at best. *

<p>
<font color="blue">
What items are misquoted? Please be very specific.<br>
Tell us what the error is. Give the web page name, and show what the error
is, and then tell us what the real truth is, and tell where you get your
information.
<p>
Here you had a whole blank
computer screen where you could have cut and pasted something, anything,
to show my error, and you showed nothing. What's your problem?
Where is your &quot;research&quot;?

</font>
<p>

*    Well, I better get going. I am sure you'll send one of your angry,
long-winded replies. Maybe I'll get lucky and I'll get this letter
posted along with the others on your axe-grinding site (hell, I bet over
half them e-mails are fake, ie; you mailed them to yourself). Get a life.*

<p>

And tell me sir, where might one find your biography? You have gone
to great lengths to attack an organization which is and has been a
positive force for change since 1935.

<p>

Is there such a fear of the truth in your psyche that you
feel it necessary to attack anyone who embraces spirituality while in
the throes of despair?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Bob,
<p>
Why would you want to read my biography?
<p>
Are you imagining that if you can find fault with me, that it will mean that
Bill Wilson didn't lie so much, or didn't steal so much money, or didn't
seduce so many sick A.A. women, or didn't sell a fascist cult religion as
a cure for alcoholism?
<p>
Sorry, but
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">
that won't wash</a>. Bill Wilson was a criminal and a heartless creep,
a phony holy man and a cult leader, no matter who or what I am.

<p>

Dear sir,

<p>

I just wanted to write a note to let you know how much I appreciate your
website.

<p>

My sister was forced into AA as a result of a DUI and we successfully sued
to free her from it.

<p>

I am in the process of sending a mailing to every church on the list she was
given that sponsors AA meetings in their buildings, and your website has
been an invaluable source.

<p>

While I cannot force any Christian to accept the truth about Alcoholics
Anonymous, I can certainly plant the seed.

<p>

Thank you for doing what you can to help others see this &quot;wolf in sheep's
clothing&quot; for what it is.

<p>

With sincere thanks,

<p>

A fan

Hi Cassandra,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks. That really makes my day.

Just spreading the word is very important. The giant advantage that A.A.
has is 70 years of proselytizing and spreading rumors and hear-say, fooling the average
people into thinking that A.A. is a great organization.
Spreading the truth at the grass-roots level is essential to counter-act that.
<p>
So thanks again for your work.
<p>
Have a good day.

Since you are anonymous, so shall I be too.  I am the webmaster for Central Office
AA Atlanta, and if it were up to me, I would link our AA site directly to yours!

<p>
I deal often with intelligent drunks who reject AA slogans, and you have given me a
resource of huge value.  Of course I can't share this with too many in the program,
or they will run me off.  (Since they are no longer judgemental, you know)

<p>
Thanks again, you are a gift from my higher power (Magilla Gorilla and all of his
friends) and I hope you are staying well, and the hell with AOL and all those narrow
minded nazi types.  Of course, I have learned that whatever keeps ya sober, is fine
with me!

<p>

Thanks again for your web-site.  I hope I have encouraged you.  My stomach turns
when I hear some zombie say that the Big Book was inspired by God, as if this email
wasn't.  But I have come to accept those people, to appreciate you, and to stay
sober for two years now.

<p>

THANK YOU JESUS ( and Magilla, and his friends, and the magical mystical speey lube
oil change team in the sky, and that doorknob over there, and ....)

Hey AO,

<p>

I saw you quoted me after one of your signatures. Cool. I'm flattered.

<p>

Hi Madame Senga,
<p>
Nice to hear from you again. And that's a good line:

I was noodling around on the net today and found the website
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221941/http://www.cultnews.com/" target="_blank">
http://www.cultnews.com/</a>
<p>
by Rick Ross. Extensive as it was, there was no mention of 12Step!! At
least not that I could
find, even using the on-site search engine specifically for that
website. So I sent an enlightening email
and I mentioned your website. Hope thats ok.The more we all help to get
the word out the better.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yeh, more than okay. There are a few people who just don't see things
the same way as we do, especially because they have never been in Alcoholics Anonymous,
or had any experience with it.
<a href="orange-rross_aa01.html" target="_blank">Rick Ross</a>, Steven Hassan,
and Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer come to mind as
three cult experts who never quite realized that A.A. more than
qualifies as a cult. I keep trying to tell them...
<p>
There is a discussion of Prof. Singer's remarks about A.A. in one of her books,
in the bibliography,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Margaret_Singer" target="_blank">here</a>,
where she declared that she didn't consider A.A. a cult. Alas, we can't
change her mind, because she died of old age recently.
<p>
But Ross and Hassan are still fair game for enlightenment.

</font>
<p>

Here's a humorous tidbit for you I just remembered: (You're gonna love
this!) When i came into AA I heard there were some AA'ers who owned cats
and &#8212; are you ready for this? I hope you're sitting down! &#8212; they never
gave their cats catnip. Catnip was a DRUG and they didn't want to drug
their cats,
they didn't think it was right to make their cats &quot;high&quot;. I'm not
kidding. Not all AA'er of course, but some
die hards, they thought it was wrong. I don't make these things up.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I love it. We can't be letting Tabby have too good of a time, now can we?
<p>
It's funny how Bill Wilson declared that A.A. members should not go on tirades
against the alcohol industry. And they shouldn't hassle &quot;normal&quot; drinkers.
They should just mind their own business and pay attention to their own problems.
<p>
But here we have some killjoys who don't even want to let a cat get a buzz on.
<p>
Sort of sounds like sour grapes grumbling, doesn't it?
</font>
<p>

Have been checking out your mail bag since I last wrote. My heart really
goes out to the people who
get trapped in 12step via the coercion of the legal/medical/gov system.
I was particularly moved by
Josie's &quot;Treatment Story&quot;. Thanks to 12Step there is a real specific
prejudice and narrow view of
the alcoholic/addict that is almost worse than the prejudice prior to
AA!
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">You're pigeonholed with one
&quot;profile&quot; (a nasty one)</a>
and one solution(a creepy one). I worry even for
my friends who drink normally one or two drinks with dinner.I tell them
'don't ever get pulled over, if you get the wrong cop, the wrong judge,
the wrong caseworker &#8212; you are going to be forced to attend The Cult in
this state, and it could
haunt you for a long time'. I also agree with what another writer wrote
in: &quot;this philosophy has infiltrated our very core as a society&quot; &#8212; I
call us the OprahChopra Culture. No one is responsible for anything
any more. No accountability.

<p>

It also really bothers me when a therapist recommends 12Step. I think
there should be full disclosure if they are AA members because that is a
conflict of interest in my opinion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Absolutely YES.
</font>
<p>
As an example: a transgender
woman I knew had been sober /on her own/ for 2 years (since her
operation) but still suffered some
depression as she adjusted. Her therapist recommended she check out AA.
<p>
My question is, Why? If the woman was sober on her own &#8212; and clearly her
coming to terms with her sexual identity was at the heart of her former
heavy drinking &#8212; then she didn't even fit AA's definition of a &quot;true
alcoholic' (one who can't quit on their own).
<p>
Ah but I think that
counselor gave herself away, by praising the women of AA as &quot;good strong
women&quot; (not true in my experience!). I told this transgender woman &quot;only
another member praises its own like that; blows its own horn. I'll bet
your therapist is a member.&quot; Because in my mind, that's the only way a
professional like that could dismiss all the rest of what this woman was
still processing. That's scarey to me, I know more than one woman with a
&quot;pro-AA&quot; therapist &#8212; and they're
all a dependent mess. Years of therapy and they still can't think for
themselves. That's not right.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No joke. A therapist who has a hidden agenda is not a therapist.
They might be a recruiter, or an evangelist, or a proselytizer, but they aren't
a competent therapist.
</font>
<p>
<a name="OA"> </a>
Like many who've recently quit I still struggle with the scars and the
crap in my head. I thought it would
be easier since I &quot;know&quot; better but it's a slow process and I just try to
accept that. Not long ago I had
some symptoms I thought sure were &#8212; gasp! &#8212; heart problems and then I
realized I'd been having feelings
of personal doom for a while (not to be confused with my feelings of
political doom, I can distinguish).
<p>
I researched and realized my symptoms were minor ones related to my
menapause but you see &#8212; they
got to me.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You'll die if you leave us!&quot;</font>
(AA) and I'm overweight
(OA:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You'll overeat and have medical complications!&quot;</font>) Fear, fear fear.
<font color="#4f007f">
You can't survive without us!
</font>
<p>
My conscious side gets it but the
subconscious is still slightly indoctrinated.  I just wanted to pass
that on, so people know that can happen, don't freak out. Sit down with
the indoctrinated &quot;inner child&quot; and calm it down. I honestly had to tell
mine, &quot;You're not dying sweety!&quot; and pump her up a bit.

<p>
<a name="shunned"> </a>
Also: someone wrote in about how hard is to make new friends &#8212; YES! It
is. There is such a lack of trust
once you've been through this sort of thing. At least for a while, until
the wounds heal. It comes from
experience and also observing what happens to others in the program and
why they get shunned or
fall off the map or stabbed in the back by smiling members. (In truth
there is a lot of high and mighty &quot;back stabbing&quot;) One of my community's
members was always trying to be &quot;in service&quot;; he tried so hard. Maybe he
was a little unusual but... when he fell on financial hard times and
wound up a recluse... over time the jokes got worse and worse and more
unkind. Everyone forgot his service and only remembered all his
peculiarities. It was heart breakingly cruel. They gossiped and made fun
of how poorly he coped.
<p>
One old timer even went so far as to say he thought this man, so n so,
was &quot;the sickest member in all of AA&quot;. Why?
Because he was too quiet and didn't know how to
communicate. This said by an old timer
who knows full well AA is full of wife beaters, pedophiles, etc. He
still said that about this poor recluse).
<p>
Even if reaching out to him didn't work (and I don't think there was
much reaching out on AA's part) there was no need to be so unkind. But
that's AA for you, the love is not unconditional (there's no such thing!)
<p>
As part of getting over my indoctrination, you cannot imagine how good
it felt recently to tell one close AA friend or two how much I hated my
two former best friends in AA. And how I will never forgive them their
years of off-and-on emotional abuse. Why bother? &quot;Forgiveness&quot; is so
taken for granted in that community it insures no change in behavior.
From any of them.
<p>
And I'm sick of feeling guilty if I have anger because
someone abused me. If I had really slammed those high maintainance
Stepperville Bitches hard every time they got demanding, controlling or
cruel it might have done them some good! But they knew to expect
unconditional forgiveness while they kept dishing out unconditonal
abuse, so...

<p>

Anyway, I know if I hang on, things get better. New and better horizons
appear. So for anyone else whose just left: HANG IN THERE. Thanks AO.
<p>
Sorry I keep writing you these novels but I love this website and its
been such a help. I really appreciate all you've done for all of us. Thanks.

Don't apologize for the length, it's okay. And I'm sure that there are other
people who can relate to what you are going through, and it might help them
to go through it too.
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and have a good day.
