Subject:<br>

<p>
How long were you in the program?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi MJG,
<p>
That depends on what you mean by &quot;the program&quot;.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
If you mean being a true believer and thoroughly working the A.A. &quot;program&quot;, the answer is zero.
I never did the 12 Steps, I never had a sponsor, and I never believed in the <i>Big Book</i> or Bill Wilson,
and I never surrendered my mind, my will, and my life to the cult.
<p>
<li>
If you mean going to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous
meetings while abstaining from alcohol and other drugs, the answer is about 3 months.
Then I discovered SMART, and didn't get to many more A.A. or N.A. meetings after that,
other than to pick up coins and keytags as they came due.
<p>
<li>
If you mean <i>real recovery</i>, where you abstain from all drugs,
including alcohol, tobacco, and any illegal drugs, while taking the
medications that the doctor prescribes, and also taking vitamins and
eating good, and getting exercise and fresh air and a suntan, and developing new
interests and really living, then the answer is 8 years, and I'm still
&quot;in the program&quot;.
</ol>
<p>
And how good it is. The person that I am now hardly even resembles the person that I was 8 years ago.
I must have looked a fright 8 years ago, because women would cross the street so that they wouldn't
have to walk by me on the sidewalk. And no, that wasn't my paranoia. It was really happening. They
were really doing it.  They would see me walking up the sidewalk towards them, and
take one look at me and cross to the other side of the street.
<p>
Then, after about 3 or 4 months off of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, I noticed that women weren't crossing
the street to avoid me any more. And then a few of them would even smile at me as they passed me on
the sidewalk.  Yes, something was changing.

<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Michael A.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA paper<br>

<p>
I have been studying some of the available material on the subject of
AA's effectiveness as a treatment program. The 12 steps are still
overwhelmingly the most &quot;perscribed&quot; treatment programs in my area. I
believe this is due, in large part, because by referring people to AA or
similar groups, it saves a lot of money from a health care/political point
of view.
<p>
While I admire the effort you have put into collecting some
statistics in regards to the overall effectiveness of the program, I
found my self trailing off in thought while reading your report. I found
this curious, as the subject itself is quite interesting to me.
Eventually it occured to me that I was losing interest for some of the
very same reasons that you yourself use in an effort to discredit the 12
step programs: A vehement refusal to ascribe value to opposing points of
view, in a way that suggests an overly emotional investment in the
subject, rather than a factual one.
<p>
Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of
facts in your paper, but there seem to be several incidents where you are
willing to assert opinions without providing evidence to back them up,
mostly when they support your point of view, naturally.
<p>
One such example
is toward the end of the paper where you say something to the effect of &quot;
Shouldn't we be aware of the sexual exploitation and rape of sponsees by
the sponsor?&quot;  To which one might ask the question: Is one more likely to
be sexually exploited or raped in the 12 step setting than in the general
population? If yes, can this be attributed to the program itself, or can
it be attributed to the fact that one is likely to find a higher
concentration of people with antisocial behaviors in a setting such as an
alcohol and drug treatment program?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm so glad you asked that particular question, because that
one is so easy to answer.
<p>
First off, I really do go out of my way to make sure that everything I say is correct, accurate,
and documented. I know that there are 12-Step true believers who are taking my web site apart with
a magnifying glass, looking for any error to complain about. And they are quick to pounce if I
make a mistake.
(<font color="#9F0000"><b><i>&quot;Hah! You misspelled the name of Henrietta Sieberling! Now your
credibility is blown. I'm not going to believe anything else that you say!&quot;</i></b></font>)
<p>
The sexual exploitation example that you picked out is a jewel. That situation has gotten totally out
of control. There are many A.A. or N.A. groups that exist solely to provide the leaders &#8212; the old
sponsors &#8212; with under-age girls, money, and free slave labor. I've gotten reports of such groups
from Washington DC (the &quot;Midtown Group&quot; of Mike Q.), California (&quot;The Pacific Group&quot; of Clancy I.),
the Young People's A.A. of Phoenix, Arizona, a Midtown offspring group in Florida, more abusive groups in
Minneapolis, MN, Seattle, WA, and more are popping up all of the time as the cult missionaries go out
and either establish new groups or take over existing groups by invading in numbers and then voting the former leaders out.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">See this list of links</a> for much more information on them.
</font>
<p>
<p>
I don't know the answer, and I am
not asserting one, just asking the question. A reasonable question, don't
you think?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, a reasonable question, and I think I gave a reasonable answer.
</font>
<p>
<p>
I can find several other instances of unsubstantiated claims,
emotion driven logic, etc. My point is this: I like the paper and the
subject, and admire the amount of work that you have put into it. But if
you really care about this issue, and want your argument to be taken
seriously, you must subject your own opinions to the same kind of harsh
criticism that you lay on the opposing side. Otherwise, you run the risk
of looking like just another propagandist with an axe to grind.
<p>
Cheers<br>
Mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'd really like to hear what those unsubstantiated claims are. I really do want every claim to be
substantiated.  And I do try to keep the rhetoric and anger down. And I know that I am emotional
when it comes to my friends being deceived and harmed or killed with cult religion bullshit.
I try to keep it down, but I am human, after all.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Andrew H.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	this is a quick precis of what i think your treatise is &#8212; i agree almost entirely with it by the way!<br>

<p>
Thank you for your persuasive, well researched, logical, thought provoking,
evidence-based, scientific, and healthily sceptical analysis of AA. I will write a
proper letter to you when I have the time.

<p>
In the meantime I have taken the liberty of re-writing the &quot;AA steps&quot; into a hastily
drafted new sequence of actions for breaking free from alcohol addiction or
dependence:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1.. Accepted we had an alcohol addiction or dependence problem which was either
detrimental or ruining our lives and realised we had the power to stop, either on
our own, or by seeking help to overcome and break this destructive pattern.
<li>
2.. Realised that we were not insane, but suffering syndromal symptoms of chemical
addiction with some or all of its various physical and mental manifestations and
could break the cycle permanently, by stopping independently &#8212; through rational
choice, or seeking rational, professional and  scientifically validated support.
<li>
3.. Made a decision to ask sensible questions about scientific studies and data
pertaining to addiction which had been published and reserved the right to
question it, accepting it once we were satisfied that it was rigorous and had been
peer reviewed openly.
<li>
4.. Made a list of feelings which made us feel troubled and angst.
<li>
5.. Discussed the above list with other people, if we felt overwhelmed by it and
felt we needed help, preferably with people who are professionally qualified.
<li>
6.. Were entirely ready to deal with our problems and difficulties.
<li>
7.. Dealt with our problems and difficulties and learned new approaches and
methods to deal with life's new problems which inevitably come to us.
<li>
8.. This remains the same as AA's step 8
<li>
9.. This remains the same as AA's step 8
<li>
10.. This remains the same as AA's step 8
<li>
11..  Sought to improve ourselves through engaging study or new activities, or
picking up again on such studies or activities which were stifled due to excessive
drinking.
<li>
12..  Having regained control of ourselves, we tried to be helpful to other people
who we came across who had an alcohol problem, knowing that they too can regain
control of their individual lives, assuming they want to of course.
All the best
</ul>

From:  	Jennifer<br>
Subject:  	&quot;An Interpretation&quot;<br>

<p>
<a href="orange-interpreted.html">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-interpreted.html</a>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I'm a recovered alcoholic and  just came  upon your web site and found it to
be quite interesting.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jennifer,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
</font>
<p>
&quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212;  that our lives had become
unmanageable&quot;

<p>
The above states we WERE  &#8212; past  tense.  We couldn't control our drinking
(past tense) and our lives were  screwed up (past tense) as a result of our
boozing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But many A.A. members continue to claim that they ARE powerless, including the <i>Big Book</i> author
Bill Wilson.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#milk_whiskey">Look here</a>.
The stupid slogan is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am powerless over people, places, and things.&quot;
</font>

</font>
<p>
Nowhere in the Big Book does it state we will  ALWAYS be powerless over
booze, and our lives will ALWAYS be a mess.  Quite  the opposite. It states that we
can recover, get well, get sane, and able  to manage our own lives (not the
lives of others)

<p>
<a name="recovered"> </a>
<font color="blue">
Bill Wilson talked out of both sides of his mouth on that one. He started off using the word &quot;recovered&quot;,
as in,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We, of Alcoholics Anonymous, are more than one hundred men and women who have
recovered from a seemingly hopeless state of mind and body. To show other alcoholics
<i>precisely how we have recovered</i> is the main purpose of this book.
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Foreword to the First Edition, William G. Wilson,
page xiii of the 3rd edition.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But so many of his sober poster children relapsed that Wilson changed his story to:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve
contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day
is a day when we must carry the vision of
God's will into all of our daily activities.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That &quot;recovered/no cure ever&quot; item is in the bait-and-switch-trick list,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#a_cure">here</a>.
</font>
<p>
The steps were designed for the REAL alcoholic,  someone who loses  control
when drinking, does a bunch of stuff while  tanked that he/she would never do
when not drinking, and can't recall it the  next day.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, &quot;the steps&quot; were
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">designed by Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>
as his standard procedures for recruiting and brainwashing new cult members.
They had nothing to do with alcoholism. Bill Wilson just edited them a little, and patched the
words &quot;alcohol&quot; and &quot;alcoholics&quot; into the first and last steps.
(Click on <a href="orange-rroot030.html">that link</a>.)

</font>
<p>
Real alkies don't have to drink every day to  create the instances that cause
unmanageability.  It's not about how much a  person drinks, or how often &#8212; 
it's about what happens to their behavior when  they drink.  So it doesn't
necessarily have to do with not paying the bills  on time.  It's mainly about
relationships with ourselves and  others.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds half-ways reasonable.  Although &quot;real alkies&quot; do drink a lot, and whether someone
often drinks to excess does have a lot to do with the diagnosis of &quot;alcoholic&quot;. 

</font>
<p>
Plus, the Big Book (which contains the program of  AA in it's first 164
pages) does not profess to being the only remedy out there  that can help people.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, Bill Wilson talked out of both sides of his mouth on that subject.
In the beginning, in order to sound moderate and attract new members, Bill Wilson wrote that
&quot;we have no monopoly&quot;, and &quot;we know only a little&quot;.
But then he switched to saying that A.A. really was <i>the only way</i>.
That item is also in the bait-and-switch list,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#only_way">here</a>.

</font>
<p>
So I'm curious if you've found some passages in  the Big Book that state the
opposite &#8212; that we'll always be sick; we never  get well, blah, blah, AA is
the only way, etc.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I just listed them. Click on those links.
</font>
<p>
I'm very happy I found your Agent Orange web  site, and I hope you respond.
In the meantime, I'll continue perusing your  stuff.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Jennifer C.

<p>
PS:  As far as Step 2:  &quot;A.A. claims  that the current meaning of this line
is just that you can believe in  anything, including a doorknob or a potato, a
mountain or a motorcycle, a  bedpan....&quot;

<p>
Ummm.....no.  The program of AA (which is  the 12 steps) does not claim you
can pick &quot;anything&quot;.  You won't find that BS in the Big Book.   And I know you
obtained a copy of the BB at one point, or borrowed someone's to  get the
direct quotes.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I have about 7 copies of the <i>Big Book</i> now, both 3rd and 4th editions, along with all of the other
&quot;council-approved&quot; publications that I've been able to get my hands on.
</font>
<p>
Chances are you heard that from a &quot;group of  drunks&quot; in some screwed up AA
meeting filled with AA gurus, psychobabblers,  where the blind are leading the
blind, and the sick lead the sick.  Or you  perhaps read it in some ridiculous
literature.  I'd like to see  how someone would be able to rely on a doorknob
to stay  sober-HAHAHA!!!!

<p>
<font color="blue">
<p>
You are correct in stating that such heresies as &quot;pray to a bedpan&quot;
and &quot;You can use <i>anything</i> as your Higher Power&quot;
is not written in the <i>Big Book</i>. It is
partially documented in other
A.A. literature, but the story that you can use <i>anything</i> as your God
is really one of those things that is passed along by word of mouth.
Although the story of a freshly-converted A.A. member praying to a bedpan
was published in an official council-approved A.A. history book. I'm
trying now to remember which one.

<p>
Bill Wilson laid the groundwork for the heresy here:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or atheist,
make it emphatic that <i>he does not have to agree with your conception of God.</i>
He can choose any conception he likes, provided it makes sense to him.
The main thing is that he be willing to believe in a Power greater than
himself and that he live by spiritual principles.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, Chapter 7,
<i>Working With Others</i>, page 93.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is, of course, sheer nonsense. An atheist is not going to &quot;believe in a Power greater than
himself&quot; who will grant miracles on demand. There is more on that
<a href="orange-heresy.html#bedpan">here</a>.
<p>
And Wilson declared that you could use your Alcoholics Anonymous group as your God:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I must quickly assure you that A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest
for faith. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your 'higher power.'
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 27.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But above all, remember that Bill Wilson was playing mind games on people. He put on airs of
being very easy-going and tolerant of other people's religious beliefs &#8212;
&quot;You can believe <i>anything</i>&quot; &#8212; 
in order to hide his real intolerant and dogmatic attitudes.
<p>
So check out these links:
<ol>

<p><li> <a href="orange-heresy.html#bedpan">The &quot;Anything As God&quot; Heresy</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod">First, prospective new members are offered a
tolerant, open-minded &quot;spiritual&quot; program, but then they get
narrow-minded demands for belief in Bill Wilson's teachings.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#keep_your_religion">First, you can keep your own religion,
and then you can't.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education">First, it's <i>&quot;any God as you
understand Him&quot;</i>, and then it's <i>&quot;You don't understand
God. You are 'confused' and 'prejudiced'.&quot;</i></a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious">First, declarations of Religious Freedom,
and then demands for Religious Conformity.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater">First, a loosely-defined &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
and then an explicitly-defined &quot;God&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#kind_of_God">Redefine God. First you get one God,
then you get a different God.</a>
</ol>


<p>
</font>
<p>
Please don't fall for the assumption that AA  meetings are THE program of AA.
Most meetings today are filled with sick  people trying to tell newcomers
how it really works.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You bring up an interesting question: &quot;What is THE REAL A.A.&quot;?
<p>
<ul>
<li>
When I criticize the 12 Steps, someone always writes in and says, &quot;No, the 12 Steps aren't the real A.A.&quot;
<li>
When I criticize the <i>Big Book</i>, someone always writes in and says, &quot;No, that isn't the real A.A.&quot;

<li>
When I criticize the meetings and the bad advice you can get there (as well as sexual exploitation),
someone always writes in and says, &quot;No, that isn't the real A.A.&quot;

<li>
When I criticize the Founders Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob, and the insane
things that they said, someone always writes in and says, &quot;No, that
isn't the real A.A.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
So what is the real A.A.?
What is the real core thing that someone must absolutely do, in order to &quot;Work A Strong Program&quot;?
<p>
 &#8212; Besides &quot;don't drink alcohol&quot;. But that is not &quot;a program&quot;; that is a command.
</font>

<p>
I know of a guy who uses the Goodyear blimp as  his HP.  That surely explains
why this dude is full of gas.

<p>
I look forward to hearing from you.

Normally I don't do things like this, but I was very disturbed by your website.
What possibly could be your motive to write something like that?  Whether it was
true or not makes no difference.  It is obvious that you have some kind of
resentment toward AA to write that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tom,
<p>
Why would I post a thing like information on
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">Bill Wilson's sexual exploitation of women</a>
who came to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings
seeking help and healing? To show that Bill Wilson was not a messenger
 from God, which is what some true-believer
A.A. members claim &#8212; that he was, in fact, a very sick man who exploited all
of the people around him.
<p>
Worse yet, such exploitation is still going on.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">Look here for information
on the current sexual exploitation of under-age girls</a>.
</font>
<p>
AA has saved thousands of lives, I don't condone anything that Bill W. did, but it
is hard to dispute the impact the man had on one of the most hideous deceases of our
time.  I have always been taught to check my motives whenever I am about to do or
write something negative about a person, you obviously don't adhere to these
principles and for this I feel very sorry for you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;AA has saved thousands of lives&quot;?</i>
</font>
<br>

But A.A. claims to have 2 millions members. Apparently, the odds of getting
 saved by A.A. are only one in a thousand.

<p>
No, A.A. has not &quot;saved thousands&quot;, or &quot;saved millions&quot;.
A very small minority of the people who come to some A.A.
meetings quit drinking by using their own will power and intelligence,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">then A.A. steals the credit for their sobriety</a>.
That's all that is happening there.
<p>
And of course I noticed the little <i>ad hominem</i> where you question my motives and my principles.
That is really standard cultish behavior.
(<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks">Look here</a>.)
You didn't supply a shred of evidence that anything I said was wrong or in error &#8212; 
you just complained that I told the truth, and questioned my character.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Great!<br>

<p>
I appreciate you giving me a voice by posting my letter.  I was thinking that
Seattle, not too far away from you, has a huge hempfest in August and
somebody should have an anti-12step booth there. I actually met the guy in AA who
coined the witticism that substituting a drug like cannabis for alcohol is
'changing seats on the titanic'. The problem with that statement is that  it is
untrue of course. Having already been through treatment, I did not find anything
like rigorous honesty until Seattle's first hempfest. Time to carry the
message.
<p>
Later, Pete

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Pete,
<p>
Hempfest. Now that's an interesting thought. But I know that I won't be there.
<p>
I don't really advocate smoking pot. I'm kind of neutral on the subject. I think that if you <i>must</i>
get high on something, that pot is one of the best choices.  And if someone were to ask
whether I would prefer to see my son drinking alcohol or smoking pot, the answer is of course that
I'd rather see him smoking pot. Pot does not kill 100,000 Americans per year like alcohol does.
And pot isn't addictive like alcohol is, and pot won't destroy your health and your body the
way that alcohol will.
<p>
Still, personally, I'm retired from that scene. I haven't had a hit of pot in 8 years, either.
I got sober without doing a substitution routine of using pot instead of alcohol. I just totally
quit everything that was bad for my health &#8212; even just a little bad. Now espresso coffee is my big kick.

<p>
One reason that I don't smoke pot any more is because my lungs can't tolerate any smoke any more.
Thirty years of smoking tobacco burned out all of my spare lung capacity and I don't have any lung cells left
to spare.
I'm really lucky that I don't have emphysema or lung cancer.
I like to joke that I'm saving my remaining lung cells for marriage.
So I just don't smoke anything at all, and I don't like to be in other people's clouds of second-hand smoke.

<p>
Another reason that I don't smoke pot is because I am really enjoying the clarity that I have now.
I have 8 years clean and sober, and this is the first and only time in my adult life that I have ever been
smoke-free, alcohol-free, and drug-free for so long.  And I like it, and I don't want to go back to getting stoned.
<p>
And one more reason that I don't smoke pot is because I don't want to start down that slippery slope.
If I were to smoke some good pot now, after 8 years of being clean, I would get high as a kite.
I obviously have zero tolerance now. You'd have to peel me off of the ceiling, I'd get so high.
That might be so much fun that maybe I should boost it with a little bit of something else and keep on tripping...
Just a little, you know... And then I might have to take a few hits of something else to calm down and
make the room stop spinning...
<p>
And you know where that can lead.

<p>
But maybe somebody else would like to &quot;carry the message&quot; to the Hempfest.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good time.

Subject:  	The Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I just read much of your online book about AA.  I don't agree with it all, but I do
think much of what you say is ON TARGET.  I laughed out loud at the jokes and a lot
of the serious stuff too because I was giving Bill W such a place of honor in my
mind and for all we know, he may well have been delusional.  LOL

<p>
The reason I found your book is because I was searching for what a &quot;sponsor&quot; is
supposed to be in AA because I was starting to get red flags regarding my sponsor's
behavior and words to me.  I have always strongly disliked any kind of manipulation
and control techniques.  Coming from a history of church, I could never stomach
pastors trying to guilt people into giving money, or attempting to control people's
behavior.  The way that I am, one could say, would protect me from ever being
indoctrinated into a cult.  Well, AA has been beginning to really get under my skin
in such ways.  I was beginning to feel I was expected to become a cookie-cutter
replica of my sponser, who I was beginning to see was a harsh angry person.  (Do
what I say, not what I do)  Was my individuality &#8212; and my freedom to think and feel
 &#8212; expected to disappear for the good of the group?  I'd been wondering.

<p>
I kept trying to tell my sponsor that I didn't understand certain things about the
steps.  I did NOT have the major white light experience with doing them as I was
TOLD I DID.  (Hehe &#8212; I actually WAS told with suggestive ways of speaking &#8212; ways that
salesman are taught to use to sell products.)  And as I was expected to TELL OTHERS I
DID.  I could never go on blabbering lies and therefore, I declined to speak when
asked tonight, because I knew if I did speak, I would have to be honest, despite the
incredible spoken and unspoken pressure to say what was expected, and I would have
to say:

<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;I did the steps and it wasn't anything great, I didn't have the obsession to drink
anyway, so no, it wasn't removed, it was ALREADY gone from the day I stopped.  I'm
not even sure exactly what I did when I did the steps, so I can't really explain it
to you, since I didn't have a real experience with them myself.  There was no great
revelation or new knowledge that I didn't already have from my Christian background.
I also want you to know that my drinking years were not all terrible.  I loved
drinking and don't deny it.  Actually, it saved my life for many years!!  I'm sure
there were times that I probably would have done myself in if it wasn't for alcohol
that relieved the incredible pressure.

<p>
&quot;AA for me is a place where I don't have to be alone anymore and there are people
with similar pasts, but the truth is that I'm beginning to feel like I'm in a very
unhealthy atmosphere, here.  It's beginning to feel cult-like if you can appreciate
that.  My sponsor already DEMANDED that I do NOT tell any of my personal story
because I should not be trying to be a Hollywood star!  I was told that was just my
EGO when I was only thinking that someone hearing may relate to my individual story,
which is a part of who I am today.  I'll be damned if I'm ever going to get up here
and bullshit you all like so many of you are probably already doing. ...And another
thing, Bill Wilson was probably suffering with delusions of grandeur, I mean what is
the Big Book, the Holy Bible?  I don't think so.  What is Bill, a messiah?  I only
have one Messiah.  I don't even know why I come here anymore, I think I'll just find
a good church where I can be who I am &#8212; because I was accepted by God before I got
here, and I was doing alot more sinning then.  Well that's enough out of me, would
anyone like to share?&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>
That's probably what I would have said.  Haha  That would've went over well, huh?

<p>
Well, I enjoyed reading your writing.  It was very interesting.
I really, really see what you mean about the parallels between AA and a cult.
I've been disturbed by it to the point that I spent HOURS reading your online book
tonight and now it's almost 6am. But it was worth it.

<p>
I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but I know I'm getting more clarity on what's
been nagging me about AA!  And that's a good thing.

<p>
Best Regards,<br>
Grace

I read some of your AA analysis. I did find it very interesting and well researched.

<p>
It points to the Program if AA as having credit for keeping someone sober, when in
fact, any sober alcoholic who is working an honest AA program will tell you that it
is God (or whomever they call God) that keeps them sober. So I can wipe out every
page or your report and sum it up as.. God save my life and AA helped me find God.

<p>
I appreciate the research you did, but its mostly irrelevant to those who have
achived spritual sobriety through the work of AA. I found little meaning in it for
me.

<p>
It may, however, keep those who think an institution, cult or club (things run by
people for people) can cure them or save them, so for that I thank you.

<p>
AA doesn't keep people sober, you are absolutely correct. Thanks for reminding me.
Now I need a meeting.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Stephen,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.<br>
<p>
You bring up all kinds of interesting questions.<br>
What about all of the A.A. members who do not credit God with saving them from alcoholism?<br>
What about the people who insist that A.A. saved their lives?<br>
<p>
What about Bill Wilson's claims that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything.<br>
</font>

</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religious organization.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, <i>Foreword</i>, page xx.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And what about the A.A. claims that even atheists can &quot;work the steps&quot; with a goofy non-God &quot;Higher Power&quot;
(G.O.D. == &quot;a Group Of Drunks&quot;),
and &quot;The Program&quot; will still work?

<p>
It seems like somebody is always pulling a switcheroo. When I criticize
<a href="orange-heresy.html">the heretical spirituality of A.A.</a>, somebody
insists that A.A. isn't religious and you don't have to believe anything. When I criticize the A.A. program
for not working, somebody else insists that it isn't the A.A. program, it's God, that saves people from
alcoholism.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
P.S.: Why do you need to go to an A.A. meeting? Shouldn't you go to church?

Hello again,

<p>
There's a new show coming on the Living Channel soon called Rehab.  I looked it up
and it's about ex-celebrities (D-listers for the most part, by the look of it) who
have been through rehab at a place called Passages in Malibu.  At first I thought
this was going to be another 12-step publicity stunt, but when you check out their
website (Passages) you find out that they are among the 7% (or whatever it is
currently) of US treatment centres who don't use the 12-steps.  They have some very
interesting things to say about why 12-step treatment doesn't work.  Check them out
here, if you haven't already.

http://www.passagesmalibu.com/</a>

<p>
I didn't check the prices &#8212; not sure most of the people I've met in AA in the last
17 years would be able to get there.  A bus to Gateshead is usually a stretch.  But
looks interesting.

<p>
Incidentally, do you know the results of AA's latest triennial survey (2008)?  I
can't find them anywhere &#8212; must have fallen through a gap at the back of Google . . .

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Gary,
<p>
I don't know where the triennial survey results are either. I suspect that the headquarters has
grown tired of being embarassed by the results. The critics of A.A. always manage to analyze
the numbers and ferret out information that the headquarters didn't want to reveal, like the dropout rate,
and the people coerced into A.A., and the aging A.A. population. So maybe no more triennial surveys
will be published.

Keep it up, I look forward to my reply next month sometime.

Orange,

<p>
Following on from my last email: I have now seen some of this series.  I was
dismayed to see that the founder of Passages is an absolute fruit-loop.  If his
methods and philosophy are portrayed fairly in the show, and if they are indicative
of the standard of the 7% of addiction treatment centres in the US that are non-12
step based, then this is bad news indeed for those who seek viable alternatives to
the 12 steps in a residential treatment setting.  Perhaps there are non-12 step
based treatment centres in the US that take addiction seriously and don't try to
treat it with stale 1990s New Age bullshit, but Passages is not one of them.

I get why you are not happy with the AA message it is killing your friends. As far
as Bill W. is concerned I dont really give a flying sack of poo if he was a nut or
not. He was not my problem and is not my solution. If his teachings brain washed me
then so be it. I am truly happy today. The fundamental problem with AA today is many
AAs seem to think that all problems could be solved by the 12 steps. This is the
absolute pinnacle of arrogance. No wonder your friends are dying. AA is for the
problem of ALCOHOL not anything else.
<p>
I understand the concern over medications but
as a sponsor I never tell any newcomer to ask me for medical advice. If they need to
detox I say go to the hospital. If they have funny thoughts I say go to a therapist.
If they cant sleep I say try a pill if you want. I also tell them if they start to
become dependent on their medications to tell the doctor. I do not do accounting but
I suggest that newcomers pay their bills if hey
can. If they dont like the message of AA then I say try another program I really
dont care about how many steps or the philosophy behind the program just try
whatever it takes to be sober and free. I am just an alcoholic not a guru or god.
<p>
AA worked for me so I am a full believer in faith and religion and magic if you
want to call it that. I was blessed with a bunch of AAs who said all we want to do
is HELP you to stay sober. They did not make personal promises to carry me through
every day one day at a time. They said this is what worked for us give it a try. If
you dont like it you can leave.
<p>
They did not need to tell me that I was going to
die from Alcoholism many in my family all ready had. So I was willing to try.
<p>
I am
recovered today. I love my creator and accept my will as his. My guidance comes
from an overwhelming sense of happiness I found through AAs program of action not
from anywhere else. I tried everything from Jesus to transedental
meditation to find that happiness I only found it in AA.
<p>
I only ask that you dont
belittle my experience because it is mine alone and you are not my judge. I truly
mourn for you friends in a deep way and mean no disrespect here as to do so would
belittle their memory. I also respect your right to express your views and commend
you an a herculean effort. I can only imagine where you find the time. The most
important thing on you site is your sober status. In that to we are fellows so I
would shake your hand if we met.

Hello George,
<p>
I'm glad that you are sober, and happy that things seem to be working out for you.
<p>
You must be aware, of course, that the vast majority of people who come to A.A. for help
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">find neither sobriety nor happiness</a>.
<p>
When you say,

<p>
That is chilling. That is classic, really quintissential, cult talk.
That's what dedicated true believers invariably say about their favorite cult. 
It doesn't matter which cult &#8212; the language is the same. It's always,
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li>
&quot;Oh, I never knew happiness until I found this wonderful group which
has the really special sacred knowledge...&quot;<br>
<li>
&quot;I got religious teachings when I was a child, but I never knew God until I joined this group.&quot;<br>
<li>
&quot;Religion never meant anything until I found this group.&quot;<br>
</ul>
</font>
(<a href="orange-rroot120.html#never_meant_anything">See the Oxford Group</a> for more examples.)

<p>
And members of Alcoholics Anonymous gave the same kind of testimony in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I had been brought up to believe in God, but I know that until I
found this A.A. program, I had never found or known faith in the
reality of God, the reality of His power that is now with me in
everything I do.<br>

Good day Mr. Orange...

<p>
Just thought I would take a moment to thank you again for the incredible work you
have put in to revealing the truth about AA.  I have written to you in the past
describing my experience when I made the break from the cult about a year ago.  My
ex-sponsor told me I was &quot;out of my fucking mind&quot; and that I &quot;would die in an alley
with a needle in my arm&quot;.  He said this after a meeting in front of several other
people.  Talk about embarrassing.
<p>
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
I decided to leave when he began implying that I
should quit taking  my zoloft.  When I told him I didn't think that my taking a
non-narcotic medication as prescribed by a mental health counselor was his business,
he came back with &quot;See, I touched a nerve, there must be something there&quot;.
<p>
The hardest part about leaving AA has been the comraderie with other addicts and
alcoholics.  Fortunately, I have been able to remain friends with a lot of members
and still get invited to weddings, birthdays and funerals, but other than that I
don't waste an hour out of my day anymore pretending that I'm powerless over
something I'm not.
<p>
Thank you and please keep up the good work.
<p>
Sincerely.....<br>
John

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the compliments,
and congratulations on your new freedom. And I'm really glad you had the strength
to tell your sponsor to flake off when he tried to get you to stop taking your medications.
Those sponsors kill more people that way.
<p>
For comraderie, do check out SMART, and SOS, and Lifering. Maybe they have a group nearby.

Hello Jan,
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your loss.  I am getting more and more reports like this.
Alcoholics Anonymous sure is breaking up a lot of marriages.
<p>
I don't know if it will help any, but here are some previous discussions of A.A. and N.A. breaking
up relationships:

<li> <a href="orange-letters97.html#na_cult">relationship destroyed by N.A.</a>

</ol>
<p>
I would tell you to have a good day, but somehow that sounds shallow and stupid in this context.
<p>
All I can say is, I wish you the best.

I am appalled at your &quot;bashing&quot; of AA.  Hopefully not too many will die when they
come across your writings and believe it..  Sober 5 years now, I give credit to my
lifestyle change to the support of the fellowship of AA.  It was impossible without
the people of Alcoholics Anonymous. Understand please that writings such as yours do
not help the alcholic/drug addict.  If you do not wish to believe it works fine but
please dont push your views on those of us who need the program to stay sober.
Granted anyone can get clean for a day on thier own.  Staying clean is the hard
part.  I wholeheartedly believe your report is wrong and quite frankly hope you
never need our help.  But if you do, we will be there to help.  One alcoholic
helping another-it works, it really does.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Denise,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety. You did it. Nobody else did it for you.
<p>
And thanks for another carbon copy of the standard A.A. grumble. You have all of the regular lines in there:
<p>
<ol>
<li> &quot;You are bashing A.A. (by telling the truth).&quot;
<li> &quot;I give credit ... to AA&quot;

<li> &quot;Your writings do not help the alcoholic.&quot;

<li>  &quot;We are so generous that we will let you come back to our cult when you relapse (which we hope you do real soon now).&quot;

<li>  &quot;it works, it really does.&quot;

<p>
<li>But best of all is,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;please dont push your views on those of us who need the program to stay sober.&quot;</font>
<p>
Apparently, you cannot see the difference between people getting sentenced to A.A. meetings, and
people voluntarily reading my web pages.

Good luck, seriously, because without God it is all &quot;luck&quot;. One quick

Hello Morgan,

Thanks for the tip. No, I had not heard about it. That is really outrageous. A woman calls an A.A. helpline,
and the A.A. &quot;helper&quot; invites her to his house and gives her wine and screws her.
That's A.A. spirituality and sobriety at its finest.

Not!

<h1>AA hotline volunteer acquitted in rape case</h1>
<h3>by MATT MILLER, Of The Patriot-News
<div style="margin-top: 6px;">Wednesday February 25, 2009, 5:58 PM</div></h3>
<p>After deliberating for six hours, a Cumberland County jury this
afternoon acquitted Alcoholics Anonymous hot line volunteer Russell C.
Mentzer Sr. of charges that he had raped a female caller.</p>
<p>The woman claimed during Mentzer's three-day trial that he had her
come to his home in November 2007, prodded her to drink wine and had
sex with her when she blacked out. She said she couldn't recall the
sex, however. </p>
<p>Mentzer, 45, of Middlesex Twp., said he and the woman had a consensual sexual encounter.</p>
<p>The woman declined comment on the verdict. Mentzer applauded it and said he will pray for his accuser.</p>
