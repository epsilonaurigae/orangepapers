Some of the more fanatical adherents of 12 steppism are fond of saying
that the 12 steps are closely modelled on the Spiritual Excercises of
&quot;Saint&quot; (!) Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits:

Hi Orange,

<p>
In response to
<a href="orange-letters134.html#John_McC" target="newwin02">John McC. and Kaiser Permanente</a>.

<p>
First, allow me to say I live in the North County area of San Diego.  I departed AA
angrily after 15 years, and did so with the help of both an addiction specialist
and therapist.  I might have less anger toward AA if it had been an honest
organization, but it is unable to, &quot;self-regulate.&quot;

<p>
I did start a Women for Sobriety meeting in my area, and attended many meetings at
Kaiser Permanente, San Diego and San Marcos.  During this time I met several female
therapists who stated to me that Kaiser does not endorse AA.

<p>
I wonder what the true connection is between Kaiser and 12 step programs.  Is this
part of their marketing, attempting to reach as many possible patients as possible,
or, is there a link between rehab treatment and the insurance companies?

<p>
I also wonder if Kaiser NoCal and Kaiser SoCal take a different approach.

<p>
Regards,

<p>

Orange:

<p>
Check out this interesting page by 12 steppers trying to rationalize and saying
that cults are not necessarily bad things.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Aaron,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. Yes, that certainly is interesting.
That web site sure does go to great lengths to promote 12-Step everything
(in violation of the Eleventh Tradition).

<p>
And the tap-dance is unreal. The minimization and denial...
And rationalization and excuse-making...
Denial ain't just a river in Egypt.

<p>
And some of the lines are absolutely priceless. I couldn't make this stuff up:
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<p><li> &quot;AA is not a cult. It is a place where you get your brainwashed.&quot;

<p><li> &quot;Attractive (and less than attractive) women get hit on EVERYWHERE and I don't know why it would be a big mystery to also have it happen at an AA meeting... why men are supposed to be not men just because they are in AA I don't understand.&quot;
<br>
<font color="blue"><i>Well maybe because it's supposed to be a CLEAN AND SAFE HEALING group, not a meat market... Doctors who screw their patients get their license
to practice medicine revoked, and they even get put in prison for it.
Why should A.A. be privileged to commit such crimes?</i></font>


<p><li> &quot;I often proudly stated that I had successfully been brainwashed of my, &quot;old alcoholic stinkin' thinkin&quot;; and that aa was my new church, my (Wilsonian) cult, and my (coffee) bar...&quot;

<p><li> &quot;AA is not a cult. It does have a cult like following.&quot;

<p><li> 'There are no statistics in AA. We don't keep files or recidivism rates, I couldn't tell you if there is a 5% relapse rate or a 50% relapse rate as offered in the forward to the second addition of the Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;textbook.&quot;'<br>
<font color="blue">
Well then, how can you say that <i>&quot;It Works&quot;</i>?
How can you incant at every meeting,
<font color="#9F0000">&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has
thoroughly followed our path&quot;</font>
when you don't even have a clue about what the real numbers are?
</font>

<p><li>
&quot;Maybe it is a cult or a crutch but it taught me how to be honest, ...&quot;

<p><li> &quot;I will make sure I live the AA program and not my own agenda.&quot;

<p><li> &quot;By definition I guess AA could be called a cult or religion but that is not what we stand for.&quot;

<p><li> &quot;some of you are just plain angry.&quot;<br>
<font color="blue">
Well gee, that answers everything, doesn't it? All criticism of A.A. is invalid
because the critics are angry.
</font>

<p><li> &quot;You say cult, like its a bad thing (LOL). Sometimes, people need other people to help them in their experience.&quot;

<p><li>  'I do not believe that AA is a cult, nor do I believe that it doesn't work for some people.
... I was actually told by a member of AA that because he did not work the steps properly that &quot;he wanted to put a gun in his mouth at 25 yrs sober.&quot;'

<p><li> &quot;A higher power does not mean GOD to all of us. It means A higher power.&quot;<br>
<font color="blue">
Just ignore the fact that starting with Step 3, the Steps say &quot;God&quot;, not &quot;higher power&quot;.
</font>

<p><li> &quot;My experience is that people who are alcoholics and attend AA mtgs. and leave, being critical of AA as they leave, just want to drink again.&quot;

<p><li> &quot;It is true however, that most alcoholics who quit AA will drink again unless they remember where they came from.&quot;
<br>
<font color="blue">
Ah, is that it? You just have to remember where you came from?
That is a very simple program of recovery. No 12 Steps, no surrender to
Higher Power, no meetings... Just remember where you came from. Sounds good to me. :-)

<a name="Clancy"> </a>
And then there is this very perceptive description of Clancy I.'s
&quot;Pacific Group&quot; over on
the West Coast. Clancy Imusland was the grand-sponsor of Mike Quinones, who
created
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin56">the &quot;Midtown Group&quot;
in Washington DC</a>,
and both groups are notorious for sexual exploitation:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In any case, I returned to LA to live with my family in Brentwood, just
down the street from the central meeting location of Clancy Imusland's
Pacific Group. Naturally, I went there, because of its proximity, I had
never heard about it. I was pretty lonely at the time, being a sober
teenager isn't easy, and was grateful for the swarms of people surrounding
me, circling meetings in the list book for me and giving me guidance.
<p>
I quickly got absorbed into the group's meeting routine, sponsorship
techniques (as a sponsee), sexist practices, elitist attitude, weekends
at Clancy's house, parties, dances, dinners on and on. It was my first
introduction into the structured cult lifestyle. While much looser than
many hard core cults, I have come to understand that the cultic phenomena
is a well defined but broad spectrum of group behaviors rather than a
single point a group arrives at in its practices. In my estimation AA
in general falls on the lower end of that spectrum, but is definitely
a major player as one of the largest thriving cultic groups that
generally flies under the radar in terms of being identified as such.
I would place the Pacific Group of AA in a more advanced category of
behavioral control and thought reform.<br>
...<br>
While it doesn't require that one believes in a specific God, it does
demand that one believes in a God, while simultaneously stating that it
doesn't, by applying a kind of double-speak rhetoric, in the &quot;as
we understood Him&quot; addendum. Double speak is one of AA's most
frequently applied mind control techniques and I believe (at this time
based more on experience than research) that it is the primary tool by
which it retains members. For instance while it states that &quot;the
only requirement for AA membership is the desire to stop drinking&quot;,
my experience has been that refusal to do the steps, get a sponsor,
read the big book, and/or regularly attend meetings (usually depending
on the community at least 3 times a week) clearly elicits vocal
disapproval and often results in social ostracism. While the member is
not banned outright he or she is shunned in various ways. The necessity,
vital importance of doing all of these things, in order to physically
survive alcoholism/addiction, is constantly asserted during sharing at
all kinds of different meetings.<br>
...<br>
Usually a cult member will tell you that they're happier and safer than
they've ever been in their lives, that the group is a force for good
and helps thousands of people, regardless of what group they belong to.
Rarely do current members of an active cult express misgivings about
their organization, only some of the people in it who are bad apples
that misrepresent the group as a whole. This kind of expression of
total satisfaction can be a dead giveaway that the system is successfully
utilizing thought reform techniques.
<p>
I recommend Robert J Lifton's &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology
of Totalism&quot; to anyone interested in learning about mind and
behavioral control.<br>

Subject:  	AA Finances<br>

<p>
Hi,<br>
Like your work. I'm putting a book together. I have only 10k words for AA, and it
doesn't look good. I'm trying to find out to what extent AA is a 'wealthy'
organisation today, and how that may express itself. For example I'm in the UK.
There are no AA clubhouses, which sound like expensive real estate.

<p>
I also postulate that the Oxford Grip was a magnet for better-off alcoholics,
looking for a cure, and than Wilson was ejected not for over evangelising an already
evangelical group, but effectively being schismatic in targeting the alcoholics
within the group. He does seem to have become very well-connected!

<p>
All the best,

<p>
Here's to rational recovery!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tony,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and good luck on your book.
<p>
I believe that you are right on with the idea that
<font color="black">
&quot;Wilson was ejected ... [for] effectively being schismatic in
targeting the alcoholics within the group.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Yes, exactly. In fact, the way that Bill Wilson was booted out of the Oxford Group
was: He and his wife Lois went to church one Sunday morning &#8212; Rev. Sam Shoemaker's
&quot;Calvary House&quot; Episcopal Church in New York City
that served as Frank Buchman's USA headquarters &#8212; and
found that they were the subject of a very critical sermon.
One of Shoemaker's assistant
preachers denounced Wilson's building of a subcult of alcoholics
within the Oxford Group cult &#8212; &quot;the divergent work of this
secret group&quot;. (Rev. Sam Shoemaker was conveniently out of town that Sunday,
and let his assistant do the dirty work.)

<p>
What Bill Wilson was doing was setting himself up as the leader of the
alcoholics &#8212; in competition with the cult leader Frank Buchman &#8212;
trying to usurp the throne from the King.
That is a big no-no in cults &#8212; the ultimate sin, in fact &#8212;
&quot;Thou shalt have no other Gods before Me.&quot;

<p>
One biographer described it this way:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One evening Bill discovered that alcoholics from the mission
had been forbidden to come to Clinton Street, and at the large
O.G. [Oxford Group] gatherings it was bandied about that,
after all, the Wilsons
were not &quot;really maximum,&quot; a phrase that was foreign to Bill and
Lois, but nonetheless upsetting. Finally, what was referred to as
the divergent work of this secret group became the subject of a
Sunday-morning sermon at Calvary. Yet, in a curious way, instead
of distressing Bill and his associates, this criticism stiffened
their resolve.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i><b>Bill W.</b></i>, Robert Thomsen, page 256.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&quot;Clinton Street&quot; was Bill and Lois' house, where Bill was holding Oxford
Group meetings for alcoholics. The &quot;mission&quot; was Calvary House,
Sam Shoemaker's church.
The phrase &quot;not maximum&quot; was a slur that meant that someone was
not totally committed to following the dictates of the cult leader,
Frank Buchman (although the official explanation was, of course, that someone
was not totally committed to doing &quot;the Will of God&quot;).
The Oxford Group came to see Bill Wilson as doing his own thing,
and not &quot;God's Will&quot;,
so he was increasingly unwelcome at Oxford Group meetings.

<p>
Why is it that cults always seem to be run by two-bit petty dictators who
can't stand one bit of competition?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
P.S.: It may have been just a typo: &quot;the Oxford Grip&quot;,
but that really sounds like a good name for the cult. It might be a very
astute Freudian slip.
<p>
Oh yes, and the question about finances:
<p>
The A.A. corporations &#8212; &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc.&quot;, and
the &quot;General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; &#8212;
are not fantastically wealthy, only about $6 million cash in the bank,
but they aren't impoverished either. And
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="newwin14">they lie and commit perjury to
get more money</a>.
<p>
Remember that the real money is in &quot;the treatment centers&quot;, which act
as the recruiting arm of the cult. &quot;12-Step treatment&quot; is a very big business.
For years, I've been using the number of $6.8 billion per year, but the
New York Times recently gave the number as $20 billion.
<p>

We have discussed the finances of the A.A. organization a bunch of times.

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
I know I'm not the first ex-true believer to express my gratitude for your web site!
Thanks for all the hard work and dedication you put into getting the truth out
there.

<p>
My history is 30 years long with AA; I was only 24 when I first got sober. I guess
I'm a little slow in &quot;seeing the light&quot; but it's been coming for a very long time.
In fact, I have read some of the books from your reading list over the years. When I
came across your web site, it was like a huge weight had been lifted. Everything I
read, (haven't read the whole thing, yet), confirmed and validated all that I knew
in my gut was true about AA! I have never felt more free. I've stopped believing all
the lies and dogma especially the biggest lie of all; that maybe I was one who was
&quot;constitutionally incapable of being honest with myself.&quot; I shared that quote with
my therapist, who is a psychiatrist, and she said, &quot;I don't even know what that
means.&quot;

<p>
As I said, my experience with AA is so long that I couldn't possibly share it all in
this one email. But I will say this: my longest period of sobriety was 9 years with
various numbering years since. Collectively, all my sober time adds up to about 20
years or so out of 30. I count that as a success but AA does not. I will never be an
&quot;oldtimer&quot; or have &quot;status&quot; in AA's eyes. After every relapse, I would start at step
one again and still get drunk. I've done several fourth steps and gone to many, many
meetings and still get drunk. This last time when I was facing four and five again
and dreading the process, I said to my sponsor that I was done working the steps.
For someone like me who has little or no self esteem and excessive guilt, the
process of the fourth and fifth steps only enhanced them.

<p>
I haven't been to a meeting for about a month and am enjoying &quot;a new freedom and a
new happiness&quot; that I have never felt in AA. Hey! One of the promises finally came
true. BTW, when I told my sponsor that after my last meeting I had problems with the
way it was conducted and the behavior of some of the so called loving and tolerant
oldtimers, she gave me the classic statement: &quot;sounds like you have a resentment.
Maybe you should read the traditions.&quot; Arghhhhhhhhhh!!!!! And I finally know that I
will not drink just because I haven't been to a meeting. I now am aware that it was
a LIE and not a self-fulfilling prophecy.

<p>
I'm trying to keep this short just wanted to convey my thanks for your commitment to
getting your message out. I've already contacted WFS and SMART and look forward to
going to the meetings here in my area. Instead of what the hate filled emails from
AA'ers say in which you may be killing someone with your site, I wanted you to now
that you just may have helped save this someone.

Hi Cheryl,
<p>
Thanks for a happy letter to brighten up my Saturday morning cup of coffee.
And thanks for the compliments.
It's Saturday morning, a week after you wrote the letter,
and I'm just getting started
on a Latt&eacute;, and your letter was the next on the list to do.
<p>
And I see another soul escaping from the birdcage and flying free.
Yes, it brightens up the morning cup of coffee.
<p>
I don't know if you saw it yet, but for people who successfully quit and
then get sucked back into drinking (or smoking, or doping) after a while,
or a few years, I recommend the web page on
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin79">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
I find that when that seductive little voice in my head starts whispering,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Oh, it will be okay. We have things under control now. Just one won't hurt.
Just one for old times' sake... We deserve it now. Wouldn't it be fun?&quot;
</i></font>
that it is the stupid Lizard Brain yammering
his (or her) excuses for getting high. Learning to not get fooled again
has been a life-saver for me.
<p>
(Incidentally, do women experience a female lizard brain talking to them?)
<p>
And there are other discussions of what works to keep us sober
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin38">here</a>

Have a good day, and a good life.

<p>
Hey Orange
<p>
just wanted to let you know that I been in and out of aa for 20 years. I
was sober before AA and that was due to meditation I didn't even smoke a ciggarette
back then.
<p>
After coming back to you articles I was suppose to be at a meeting
reading my secretary report and I had family business. My sponsor was irate with me
and told me something has been wrong. I told her yes there was and I had questions.
She proceeded to tell me that I was self will run riot not grateful etc. I hung up
on her gave her my key to the hall and she in turned and shared with everyone she
could that I must have already picked up a drink. Then proceeded to write me a three
page letter which she wanted to read to a woman who threw me out of her house
because she thought I was headed for a drink.
<p>
You know what I find so funny. If I
never thought of drinking they sure kept putting shit like this in my mind. I do
believe in Jesus Christ and the biggest article that helped me was the one
[by]
<a href="orange-rroot900.html" target="newwin09">H.A. Ironside</a>.
AA interferes with my faith and I've known this for awhile. Also just so
you know one of my family members was hurt sexually and AA's answer after asking for
support was when's the last time you did something for your group two weeks after
finding out about this horrific part of my life.
<p>
I'm done. Thank You.

Subject:  	Bill Wilson<br>

<p>
Hello,
<p>
My name is Andrew. I am a sober member of Alcoholics Anonymous with 6 years
of sobriety. I read most of your article on Bill and his over driven sexual
promiscuity. We know about Bill and his life. Some of us have struggled with
that as well. It is plainly obvious that we are a few cards short of a full
hand on a lot of days and in no way is that implying that what some of us
have done and in certain instances may still do excusable. However the
actions of one member can in no way reflect Alcoholics Anonymous as a whole.
Most AA members are decent, and useful citizens today. The action of AA as a
whole really can be the only final judgement of the program's success or
lack thereof. I understand your anger at this man. Also a word on Bill's so
called healings (called not only by you)-

Forgive me, I hit the send button too soon. Maybe I'll take that as a hint
to shut up now. Just want to say that putting up this sort of material in a
blog/article is KILLING PEOPLE, who may have had an opportunity for a
longer, happier, more decent sober life. That is our concern.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Andrew,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Starting at the top, yes, I know that there are
a lot of good people to be found in A.A., but that does not make A.A. a good
organization.

<p>
This is false logic:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;However the actions of one member can in no way reflect
Alcoholics Anonymous as a whole.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Oh yes they can. When a cult leader and sexual predator like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin85">
Mike Q. turns A.A. into a sexual exploitation society</a>,
that really does change what A.A. actually is for the people in that area.
And when similar creeps and criminals do it all over the country &#8212; in
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="newwin86">Phoenix</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters87.html#Pacific" target="newwin87">California</a>, and
Miami and Tampa, and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160701025313/http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=185546838&amp;blogID=265904083" target="newwin88">Minneapolis</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters100.html#Bainbridge" target="newwin89">Bainbridge Island, Washington</a>,
then that changes what A.A. really is.
And when the A.A. leaders in the Interchurch Building in New York City refuse to
do anything to fix the problem, then that also changes what A.A. is.

<p>
I agree with this statement of yours:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;The action of AA as a whole really can be the only final judgement
of the program's success or lack thereof.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Unfortunately, when A.A. was put to the test by qualified doctors,
what &quot;the action of A.A.&quot; did was produce a zero-percent
improvement in sobriety of alcoholics, while A.A. also:
<p>
<a name="tests"> </a>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin21">raised the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin22">raised the rate of rearrests</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin23">increased the costs of hospitalization later</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin24">raised the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<li> And a whole year of A.A.-based treatment
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="newwin25">was no more
effective than a doctor talking to alcoholics and their wives for just one hour</a>,
telling them to quit drinking or they would die.
</ol>
<p>
So that is the &quot;final judgement&quot; of A.A. as a cure,
or &quot;not-a-cure-but-a-one-day-solution&quot;, for alcoholism.

<p>
Your accusation claiming that telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous
was killing people, and depriving alcoholics of the
<font color="black">
&quot;opportunity for a longer, happier, more decent sober life&quot;</font>,
is actually backwards.
(Besides being
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin76">
a very common often-parrotted cultish put-down</a>.)
Telling people about
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin38">the better ways of dealing with alcoholism</a>
does not kill them.
<p>
What about all of the people who were hurt by the manipulative,
exploitative monsters whom they met in A.A. meeting rooms, and
who were driven away from recovery, or driven to suicide by the guilt-induction
routines in the 12 Steps?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Good day, Orange.  I hope this message finds you well.

<p>
I was browsing through your letters and saw that you'd asked about
Intervention, the A&amp;E television show.  Episodes are available on their
website.  I saw my first few episodes last week in an idle moment, and
did not find the show to be entertaining or educational in the least,
but I do enjoy real-life drama, so I was riveted to the &quot;what will
happen after the intervention&quot; (the results).  Unfortunately, what was
true was that most if not all of the people had some sort of relapse,
which happens (I believe) when we're forced into doing something that
we're not completely ready to do.

Well,
I'm pleased to report that I'm &quot;a-fixing to get ready&quot; to quit.  Again.
I'll go re-read the &quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin14">addition monster</a>&quot; piece to get my mind ready for
this attempt, and will also go to the American Cancer Society for more
tools.

<p>
As always, thank you for your service to the community.  Although I'm
entrenched in Alcoholics Anonymous for the &quot;Unity, Service and
Recovery&quot;, I fully applaud your reasoning and if you save even one life
besides your own for someone who would otherwise die as a result of AA
programming, you've done a great thing.  Your writings won't keep me
from AA, but they will help me keep an open mind to the folks like you
and Bufe who see AA for what it is, a cultish, passive-aggressive
organization where the groups with charismatic leaders run the
followers' lives.  I see the practical value in helping others, and so
far, the 12 Steps have worked for me, where religion (Christianity) did
not.  I tried to &quot;cut down&quot; and control my drinking at many junctures
unsuccessfully, so complete abstinence with the help of the fellowship
of AA was the solution that worked for me.  Your mileage may vary.
(I've always been a very staunch advocate of &quot;AA is not for everyone &#8212; 
If you have another solution that works for you, by all means, use it&quot;)

<p>
I feel some sympathy for those AA'ers who cannot keep an open mind
toward your writings and insist on debating with you on the virtues of
the Program.  (The book Alcoholics Anonymous has these quotes, &quot;And we
have ceased fighting anything or anyone-even alcohol&quot;, and &quot;Be quick to
see where religious people are right&quot; (that could easily be expanded to
be other people))

<p>
Anyway, enough rambling &#8212; have a great life, and thanks again.

Hello again Eric,
<p>
Thanks for the input, and thanks for the thanks,
and I hope you are doing well. Especially, hang in
there and kick the nicotine addiction. It's really worth it. Never mind vague
way-in-the-future threats like lung cancer &#8212; the improvement in the
quality of day-to-day life now is fantastic. Instead of laying around the
house sick and tired all of the time, I'm always going out and about,
which is how I end up spending so much time down at the river with the
geese, as well as doing a lot of other things that I never used to do.
Now, I have so much energy that I just can't stand to be cooped up indoors
all day long. I can't just sit still or lay around all day long, or
it feels like I haven't lived the day.
I have to get out and go do things.
That is like a day and night contrast from my previous existence.
(I won't even call it my previous &quot;life&quot;.) For me, just the improvement
in quality of life makes it so worth it that I would never consider going
back to smoking now.  Why return to Hell once you have escaped?

<p>
Good fortune. I won't say &quot;Good luck&quot;, because it isn't luck.
<p>
And have a good day.

Hi there,

<p>
I must say I find your pages very amusing if somewhat also tragic to read. I
have never seen anyone so obssessed with a topic as you are with A. A. Your
whole world seems to be focused on it. And still you claim that A. A. is not
doing anything good for anyone: hey, it keeps you busy, am I right or am I
right? You are in fact &quot;sober&quot; possibly because of your constant written
aversions, prejudices, &quot;facts&quot; (truths are always funny when millions of
people should represent so few) and strange belief in non-thinking people on
this planet. You are a pathetic display of megalomania yourself and to
believe your page is to consider you being some almighty god in the
oldfashioned way you seem to think everyone believes in. But I thank you for
making me laugh and see how fucked up one single man can be. Next time you
critisize something I recommend you try it first, because experience is what
you gain from action, while theory about not doing something is called
delusions. You are delusional. I hope for you that you somehow find out that
it is one journey for one man only someday. Take care.

Hi Rune,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Well, I'm not obsessed with &quot;proving A.A. wrong.&quot;
In fact, at times, I've tired of the debate and walked away from the web site
for as long as a year at a time. As a matter of
fact, in the two days before I got your letter, I went down to the river and
fed the geese, and enjoyed walking along the waterfront. And went to the library and
checked on books. And went shopping for bargains at Goodwill and Dollar Tree. And
also went grocery shopping. And then I came home and unloaded my stuff, and then
picked up my laptop computer and went to a free wifi node and downloaded my email,
and heard that I was &quot;obsessed with A.A.&quot;.  Oh well, so it goes.
<p>
(But of course somebody who goes to seven A.A. meetings a week isn't obsessed with
A.A., right?)
<p>
If I am reading your letter correctly, you seem to be saying that A.A. is at least
keeping alcoholics busy and giving them something to do.
Just &quot;keeping somebody busy&quot; does not justify the existence of
Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; not
when we consider the harm that it also does.  A.A. makes people sicker and raises
the death rate in alcoholics.
That is a lot more than just keeping them busy.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

How dare you have a website like this and provide all this research so that someone

So I prayed (Yes, a Christian) and came across your site.  Thank God!

Unfortunately, as grateful as I am for having my suspicions confirmed, I now am

Yes, they are ostrocizing me but the worst part is, I fear for them.  I appreciate
your links to how to reach them and pray I can.  Most of them are involved in &quot;A

Hello Barbara,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments, and I hope you are feeling well.
<p>
Right away, I'd go and check out some SMART and WFS meetings, just to see if you can
find some other women friends to replace what you are losing. And you could also
check out Lifering and SOS on the Internet. In fact, I think that all of them have
online meetings now.  Loneliness is one of the biggest problems when someone quits
12-Step groups (or any cult, for that matter). And some of the people that you had
to leave behind were wonderful and pleasant company. So I think it will help you
a lot to find new friends who share your desire to not die by ethanol.

From:  	&quot;Remission&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thanks for what you have done, and a few questions<br>

<p>
Hay there Orange im another fan of the work you have done on this site, you really
have dissected the AA programme beautifully.  I'd like to add my thoughts and
experiences to your letters page.  I've read them all and eagerly await the new ones.  I
like the comparison with Gandalf and think it suits you,  not just because you look
like him,  but because Gandalf is wise. 
<p>
I enjoy the global aspect of your letters  and can report that here in New Zealand
we experience the same problems as the rest of the world, I got the brainwashing in
treatment about 25 years ago at the tender age of twenty, I was under the impression
that our treatment centre was a &quot;world leader&quot; in treatment methods, na it was
standard AA brainwashing administered at the hands of mostly AA member medical
people. I relate to your story about the child molstering group leader, I had a Heroin
importing group leader who won himself 10 years jail shortly after I finished the
course. 

<p>
9 unhappy years in AA and that was it for me, back on the piss for the next 14
years, I became extremely chronic... I was miserable. I thought I had turned my back on
AA and its fake world, yet when I think about it I used to feel the noose of my
drinking tightening around my neck but would always think&quot;no way I'm going back to
that place, I'd rather party myself to death&quot;. I was raging against the brainwashing
without realizing it...  I never used to think about the option of just stopping, I was
still brainwashed and was a classic example of someone who believed that the options
where AA or drink. But it happened for me just the way you describe, I woke up from a
blackout and decided that's it, it just wasn't worth it and stopped. I went back to
the meetings, within a month I knew I wouldn't be going anymore. It was very scary to
notice how quickly I started talking cult again, I remembered it all and just went
into automatic. That was 15 months ago and I've been sober since then, loving it in
fact.  I needed to find something to do with my evenings, so I got a computer, which I
had no idea how to operate, and started to learn, one of the first things I did when I
worked out how to goggle was to search AA cult? Bingo! Orange papers and goodbye to
my evenings for the next three months. On day three it all just fell out of my
head, the brainwashing I mean. I've heard you describe it as the light coming on and
that was it totally. That was a freaky, and releaving feeling. Man its unbelievable to
relize the extent of the harm this system of treating alcoholics has caused. 

<p>
I cracked up when I found out that old Bill had Datura; I share that experince with
him. I didn't see god tho. . but i did see a giant roman chariot coming down the road
at me!!

<p>
some questions for you, if you have time. . 

<p>
<a name="memes"> </a>
Do you think the 12 step cult is a meme?...  id like to hear your thoughts onit. My
limited understanding of memes leads me to believe it is, and if a meme is a unit of
thought that can transmit itself like a virus, is the 12 step movement a meme
pandemic?, spreading itself around the world and into various mutations such as
NA, alanon ect? (scary!!)

<p>
Do you no if the World Health Organization has a definition of alcoholism? Do they
see it as a disease? I've searched their site and can't find anything like a
definition. Plenty on alcohol dependency tho, are they distancing themselves from
the disease model? I certainly can't find their alcoholisim definition. As I said I'm
young in the ways of the computer, lol, maybe grey beard can help. 

<p>
How does cognitive dissonance operate and do you think it is in play within the
fellowship?

<p>
I've got a million questions but will leave it there at the moment. I've avoided
drunkalogging or stepalogging but will write again with more experinces. A final
thought... it's us people the sufferers of addictions who have to blaze a trail out of
the mire, your letters page is the most valuable resource I personally have
found... how about an interactive message board? People on my dating site are getting
sick of me ranting about it all... :-) 

<p>
cheers dude,
Remission... NZ

<font color="blue">
Hello &quot;Remission&quot;,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. To answer your questions:

<ol>
<li>  <i>A.A. as a meme.</i><br>
As you suggested, A.A. is a pandemic of memes, not just one. And memes do operate like
viruses. After the vampire bites you, you go around trying to bite somebody else and
turn them into your kind.
<p>
A.A. memes:
<ul>
<li> Nobody can do it alone.
<li> Alcoholism is a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
<li> Alcoholism requires a spiritual cure.
<li> Recovering alcoholics require &quot;a program&quot;.
<li> Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.
<li> Recovery from alcoholism requires servitude to a Higher Power.
<li> Somebody with many years of sobriety is wiser than somebody else without those years.
(Which would make Bill Wilson wiser than Jesus Christ, who was notorious for making
wine out of water and drinking it at parties...)
<li> Going to meetings aids in the recovery from alcoholism.
<li> A.A. is the best way to recover from alcoholism or addiction.
<li> You can't trust an alcoholic because he'll relapse on you if he misses a meeting.
<li> Immoral behavior is okay because &quot;we are not saints&quot;. At least they aren't drinking.
<li> Giving to others what was so freely given to us...
<li> The Twelve Steps work if people work them right.
<li> A former addict or alcoholic is the best counselor for drug and alcohol problems.
<li>  and I'm sure there are a dozen more...
</ul>

<p>
<li> 
I don't know about the WHO definition of alcoholism.
I'll have to check that out and see what their opinion is.

<p>
<a name="cognitive_dissonance"> </a>
<li> 
<font color="black">
&quot;How does cognitive dissonance operate and do you think it is in play within the
fellowship?&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<p>
Oh yeh. That's a big part of how the mind-bending mechanics operate.
First off, look at the Cult Test question and answer for
&quot;Use of the Cognitive Dissonance Technique&quot;,
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_cognitive" target="newwin33">the question here</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_cognitive" target="newwin34">the answer here</a>.

<p>
A.A. uses the Cognitive Dissonance Technique technique all of the time.
Confessing personal secrets to a group of strangers at an A.A. meeting creates an
illusion of closeness and brotherhood, because
<i>cognitive dissonance</i>
kicks in. Ordinarily, we only reveal our innermost secrets to our closest,
most trusted friends. When we are pressured and pushed into revealing our secrets to
a room full of strangers &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;You are only as sick as your secrets.
Your secrets keep you sick. You can't take the power out of it if you
don't talk it out.&quot;</i>
</font>
&#8212; it creates an inner conflict. The subconscious
mind's answer to the problem is to come to believe that those people
<i>really are</i> our closest, dearest friends, so there isn't any problem.
Thus the newcomers find themselves feeling really close to some people about
whom they really know nothing, and shouldn't necessarily be trusting.
(Which occasionally makes the job of predators easy.)
<p>
Similarly, if you disagree with or criticize the beliefs of the other A.A. group members,
they frown and disapprove and don't like you. So you have to bite your tongue and maybe
even say some luke-warm positive things about &quot;The Program&quot;, even if you don't believe
it, if you want the group's approval and acceptance.
At the same time, you don't want to think of yourself as a lying phony.
So the subconscious mind's answer is to <i>&quot;come to believe&quot;</i> that it's all true, and
A.A. really is wonderful, and The Program really is perfect.
Now there is no conflict and you can feel good about yourself
as everybody pats you on the back for &quot;getting The Program&quot;.

<p>
<li> About the message board: Yes, I've got to do that. I came to that conclusion
a while back. I've downloaded about three or
four different software packages for setting up forums and message boards,
and I just have to study them
and test them and decide which one to use, and then get it set up. But it's definitely
do-able. One of the big reasons why I chose my current web host was because they run
Linux on the servers and allow custom cgi-bin programs to be installed
&#8212; things like a forum/bulletin board system. So it's coming.
