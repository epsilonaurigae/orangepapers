From:  	&quot;Linda L.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Twelve Step Snake Oil<br>

<p>

*Dear Mr./Ms. A. Orange,*<br>
** <br>
*I have never read such garbage anywhere and I've heard a lot of reasons
why people don't like the &quot;12 Steps&quot;. It's obvious you have never been
involved in a 12 step program of any kind. Otherwise you wouldn't make
these blatantly angry statements about them. I happen to know that these
steps have saved hundreds, thousands of lives because they are what
people need. I'm one of those Adult Children of an Alcoholic whose life
was saved by the ACoA 12 steps. I attended meetings for 16 years; not a
lifetime as you suggest. That's only for those people in AA who don't go
beyond the 12 steps and really look at themselves and their lives. *<br>
** 

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Linda,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
16 years of 12-Step meetings, and you are still that angry? What happened to
&quot;Serene and Grateful&quot;?
<p>
You claim that ACOA has saved thousands of lives? Where is the evidence
for that? I mean real evidence, not just hearsay or proof by anecdote.
<p>
Please, this is an important point. In fact, it is the whole ball game.
The 12-Step organizations routinely make grand sweeping declarations of
great success, a zillion lives saved... But when we carefully examine those
claims, they always fall apart, and degenerate into,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, I *really* like the meetings. They make me feel special.&quot;
</font>
</font>
<p>

*My advice to anyone is don't knock it until you've tried it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is terrible advice.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't knock Jim Jones's cyanide koolaid until you've
tried it. Heck, it might be good for you and make you spiritual. You never know...&quot;
</font>
<p>
That advice is quintessential alcoholism. Want to introduce an innocent young
person to drugs and alcohol? Just say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Heck, don't knock it before you've tried it.&quot;
</font>
<p>
One of the nice things about being an intelligent human being
is that we can learn from other people's mistakes.
We don't have to try everything and make all of the mistakes ourselves.
<p>
We can see what
happened to the Moonies and the Scientologists and
the Hari Krishnas and the Heaven's Gate cult and the Branch Davidians
and Jim Jones's Peoples' Temple,
and then say, &quot;Hmmm. I don't think I want to go there.&quot;
<p>
We don't *have to* try it before we knock it.
<p>
Likewise, I can also look at what happened to the Steppers and then say,
&quot;No way am I going to waste 16 years of my life in that rubber room.&quot;
</font>
<p>

 I know
some therapist who say it's just another addiction. I also know these
therapist don't like the competition and are afraid they'll lose their
clients. Which of course is not true. Most people in 12 Step programs
recognize that they need both. Each has immense benefits in helping
those of us who recognize that our lives can be better. Denial is a
natural human way of protecting ourselves. I wonder what your denial is
protecting you from.*<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
About,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Denial is a natural human way of protecting ourselves.&quot;
</font>
You should look at yourself. Don't you notice how non-linear you go when
someone says that Steppism is a cult? (One to which you gave 16 years of
your life...)
<p>
Don't you notice how you have to rationalize that the counselors are
criticizing your addiction to the 12-Step cult only because
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;these therapists don't like the competition and are afraid they'll lose their
clients&quot;</font>?
Talk about somebody being in denial.

<p>
And the Steppers have no monopoly on &quot;recognizing that our lives can be better.&quot;
<p>
What I criticize in the <a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">Snake Oil web page</a>
is how people's lives <i><b>do not</b></i> get better as a result of
practicing Steppism.
<p>
You said that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Each has immense benefits in helping
those of us who recognize that our lives can be better.&quot;<br>
</font>
Where do you get any evidence that years of practicing the 12 Steps gives people
&quot;benefits&quot;? What the <i>Snake Oil</i> web page is about is how the 12-Step quack medicine
does just the opposite: it hurts people, rather than giving them benefits.
<p>
How can you even think that making Children of Alcoholics list and confess all
of their sins (Steps 4 and 5) is going to somehow fix the lingering injuries from child abuse?
What a bizarre, twisted, guilt-inducing cult religion.
What are those unfortunate children supposed to confess? Their poor choice of parents?

<p>
That guilt-induction routine is enough to drive some people to suicide.<br>
How many suicides have you had in your groups, in your 16 years of membership
in the 12-Step cult?

<p>
So, really, just what benefits are you talking about?<br>
And please don't give me vague grand generalities like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;telling us that our lives can be better...&quot;
</font>

<p>
You've had 16 years of Steppism, and you are apparently still in counseling,
and you haven't recovered,
so precisely how did the 12-Step dance improve your life over the last 16 years?
</font>
<p>
** <br>
*I do hope the author A. Orange reads this as it is written for him.*
<p>
 
*Sincerely,*<br>
*Linda L.*

<p>
<font color="blue">
Linda, your wish is granted. This is the real Agent Orange talking to you.
<p>
I hope you recover some day.<br>
Get out of the Roomz. Get a life.<br>
In the mean time, have a good day anyway.<br>

Subject:  	Thank you

<p>

Dear AO,
<p>
You are absolutely right &#8212; I am in the fight for my life.  I am a mom of
two, married for 30 years and decided to stop my abuse of prescription
opiates.   A catastrophic event did not lead me to this decision &#8212; no
death, no loss of job, no family member threatening me.  I had simply
had enough.

<p>

Finding help was the problem.  Hindsight tells me I really should have
consulted my physician &#8212; he provided none of my prescriptions.  However,
for over one year I searched online, specifically for a doctor that
treated with Suboxone.  After screwing up the courage, I called some of
the doctors in my area on the SAMSI list.  Either there was a long
waiting list or the doctors were not authorized as the government
website suggests.  One doctor in another county (see, the private
numbers of doctors were listed) told me I was SOL and to consider
admitting myself to a rehab unit.  To shorten this story &#8212; after one
year of looking for a doctor to help me, I found one, and one that was
authorized to treat with Sub, and one not on *the* list.

<p>

As you are probably aware Suboxone takes away the craving &#8212; a true
miracle drug.  I realize I could be on it for life &#8212; the doctor put me
in control of the timeline to taper, if ever.  He rightfully insisted
(required by Federal guidelines) that I seek a therapy, which I did.  I
found a licensed substance abuse counselor that insists I participate in
AA (or NA) &#8212; and that has been my sole source of anxiety since I quit
using one week ago.  One point I identified in your &quot;papers&quot;  &#8212; I am in
the fight for my life and I must be very careful who I entrust to treat
me and my mental health.

<p>

I consider myself fairly astute and have had zero exposure to AA.
*Something* (that little cartoon character on my shoulder, perhaps) told
me to look into AA.  I went to their &quot;cafe&quot; website.  The very first
statement that rubbed me the wrong way was that I had to accept I am
powerless.  Bullshit!  As I read on about AA, there is more and more
that that builds conflict within myself about the attendance of such
meetings.  Again, I am in my very early stages of recovery, and the only
anxiety I am feeling is the result of being coerced into AA.

<p>

I also see something else that is very dangerous here.  My therapist (I
can see after one meeting I am going to have to change) is an alcoholic
that has been in recovery for 20 years.  (You know where this is
going).  She did say I could join any other support group, it didn't
have to be AA.  As a licensed SAC, there is no doubt in my mind she
knows there are no SMART, SOS, WFS or LifeRing in our area.  She even
used the AA jargon in my first session, &quot;walk the walk&quot;  or &quot;take what
you can use.&quot;  So, AA's tentacles have reached into our professional
medical community to guide those when they at their weakest.  This is so
very lazy of our medical community.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sylvia,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are getting it together.
Sounds good.
<p>
You can get LifeRing on the Internet. They have online
meetings --<br>

</font>
<p>

I did read with interest your listed benefits of AA.  The benefits
listed are not anything that cannot be found anywhere else.  I will
choose to seek those benefits without the strings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
True.
</font>
<p>

I have joined the online group at SMART and may even look into WFS and
LifeRing.  These support groups deal focus on cravings, something I am
fortunate enough not to experience &#8212; at least not yet.  I will take from
these groups the opportunity to learn more about myself, to grow
stronger.  Your work has given me the courage not to yield to demands of
others.  For that, I say thank you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Online SMART sounds good. And thanks for the compliment.
</font>
<p>

sylvia s.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The one thing I would add is, &quot;Especially read about the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>,
if you haven't already.&quot;
You have already quit. Now you need to defeat that little monster who
keeps telling you that it's okay to just have a few now...
Understanding how he works and what he does has been a huge help for
me. Quitting is one thing; surviving the mind games that come after
the withdrawal is something else.
<p>
Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to write back, and I'll try
to respond even sooner.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Thank You<br>

<p>
I just found your site and what a relief!  I walked away from NA and AA
years ago and have been sober since 1991. When I walked away I thought I
would face the horrors promised me by AA/NA members. For over 20 years I
bounced in and out of the program being told if I did not do things
their way I would get drunk or high, I damn sure did! Once I walked away
I was scared and thought I would be attacked by drugs and alcohol, but I
eventually became more comfortable with myself and my own thoughts, not
those that were being drummed into my head.

<p>
I am completing my bachelor of science in Community and Human Services
with a concentration in counseling.  I worked with a woman who was a big
shot with the alcohol council for NYS and one question she asked me was
what I would find difficult when counseling people. I told her I would
find it hard to send every substance abuser to 12 step groups because
that is just the way it is. She agreed somewhat, but I know substance
abuse counseling as a career is not for me, I would never ever demand
anyone attend something that is not right for them.

<p>

I look forward to reading your whole site.  From what I have read so
far I think you deserve some kind of award!

<p>

Diane P.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Diane,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments, and congratulations on your years of success.
<p>
I am troubled by the idea that you should not be a substance
abuse counselor because you don't want to send people to 12-Step groups.
We need more people like you in the &quot;recovery industry&quot;, not less.
Right now, there are so many fools that know nothing except
&quot;Go to meetings, get a sponsor, and work the Steps&quot;.
<p>
Did you read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction</a>,
where I learned that my Stepper counselor was snorting
cocaine and screwing his step-children while he taught us how to be &quot;spiritual&quot;?
That's your competition. You can hardly do worse.
Now go out there and beat the pants off of the competition!
(Sorry for the pun.)

And have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Rob B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	hello

<p>

I've been reading your website. I was in CODA for 14 months
and it was one of the worst experiences in my life. I reject
12 step theology and I totally reject the theory that any behavior
(including alcoholism) is a disease.

<p>

I am a practicing catholic, and I've voted Republican for the last 15 years.

<p>

A majority of what you have written I agree with. Some of the political
jabs I don't.

<p>

I will ask you to do something if you can. Find a consevative,
traditional christian or catholic website find out who to contact and
send them an email with one simple question:

<p>

&quot;Do you believe that alcoholism and other addictive behaviors are a disease?&quot;

<p>

The answers I believe will most undoubtedly be NO!

<p>

(There are liberal christian and catholics who believe it is but, I
don't believe they are in any way the majority.)

<p>

I also sent an email to the AMA asking this:

Subject: alcoholism [&quot;Council on Scientific Affairs&quot;] (Contact Us)

<p>

The AMA endorses the proposition that drug dependencies such alcoholism
are diseases.
I would like to know if you have any medical scientific evidence that
supports this. If so, can you either provide me with or tell me where I
can obtain it? (web, books etc.)

<p>
also

<p>
Behaviors such as codependency, overeating, and being a sociopath are
being referred to as diseases. Does the AMA support those propositions?
If so can you provide me with or refer me to any medical scientific
evidence thats supports that?

Dear Mr. B.:

<p>
Your request to our Council on Science and Public Health was forwarded
to me. There are many resources you can look at. A good earlier look at
this issue can be found in RM Morse, DK Flavin. The Definition of
Alcoholism. JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), August
26, 1992 &#8212; vol. 268, No. 8. An abstract is available on our website:

although the full article might be found elsewhere on
the web.

<p>
The standard description and criteria for diagnosis as a disease
(similarly for other drug dependencies) can be found in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition &#8212; &quot;DSM-IV&quot;
published by the American Psychiatric Association. They have also
published a several volume DSM Sourcebook which goes into the research
support for the content of the DSM. A brief synopsis of this information
is provided in &quot;Alcohol Alert 30: Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse
and Dependence&quot; from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism (NIAAA) at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320021016/http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications" target="_blank">www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications</a>.

Myths About Addiction published by the National Academy Press, 1997.

diseases. We do have a policy regarding depression:

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

H-345.984 Awareness, Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression

<p>
(1) The AMA will disseminate information to physicians and the public
that depression is a significant illness that should be treated and when
it occurs with another medical illness is a separate condition requiring
treatment. The AMA supports full reimbursement and payment, without
prejudice, for physician services related to the diagnosis and treatment
of clinical depression.

<p>
(2) Our AMA encourages: (a) medical schools, primary care residencies,
and other training programs as appropriate to include the appropriate
knowledge and skills to enable graduates to recognize, diagnose, and
treat depression, both when it occurs by itself and when it occurs with
another general medical condition; (b) all physicians providing clinical
care to acquire the same knowledge and skills; and (c) additional
research into the course and outcomes of patients with depression who
are seen in general medical settings and into the development of
clinical and systems approaches designed to improve patient outcomes.
Furthermore, any approaches designed to manage care by reduction in the
demand for services should be based on scientifically sound outcomes
research findings.

<p>
(3) Our AMA will work with the National Institute on Mental Health and
appropriate medical specialty and mental health advocacy groups to
increase public awareness about depression, to reduce the stigma
associated with depression, and to increase patient access to quality
care for depression. (Res. 502, I-96; Reaffirm &amp; Appended: CSA Rep. 7,

<font color="blue">
Wow Rob,
<p>
Thanks for a neat letter. It never occurred to me to write to the AMA
and bug them for an explanation of their &quot;disease theory of alcoholism&quot;.

<p>
Their treatment of you was disingenuous, to put it mildly, if not downright dishonest.
Another word that comes to mind is &quot;evasive&quot;.
Your correspondent basically just tried bury you in irrelevant garbage and give
you the run-around, and then to shoo you away and send you over to the American
Psychiatric Association, rather than to honestly answer your question.


<p>
I am still wading through the papers that Mr. Yoast referred to on the AMA and
NIAAA web sites.
He sure didn't supply a simple, clear easy-to-find
definition of &quot;alcoholism, the disease&quot;.
<p>
Mr. Yoast seemed to be quite happy to change the subject and go on and
on about depression, which you did not ask about, but he never defined
&quot;alcoholism&quot;.
(That is the propaganda and debating trick of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert" target="_blank">Divert Attention Away From the Point</a>&quot;
It's also the politician's technique of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#answer_question" target="_blank">Answer a question that was not asked</a>,
to avoid answering the embarassing question that was asked.&quot;)

<p>
Nor did Mr. Yoast answer your questions about those other
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">12-Step diseases</a>&quot;, other than
to say that &quot;they had no policy&quot;.
<p>
Why didn't he cut and paste a simple concise definition of alcoholism
while he was cutting and pasting all of that irrelevant stuff about depression?

<p>
One very interesting fact that I did stumble across on the A.M.A. web site
was this statement in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320021016/http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/1926.html" target="_blank">the history of the AMA</a>:<br>
<center>
<b>1956: AMA declares alcoholism an illness</b>
</center>
<p>
Oh, an &quot;illness&quot;, huh? Not a &quot;disease&quot;,
like the Steppers have been telling us? Those words are not the same thing.
<p>
I agree that alcoholics who are killing themselves with alcohol have an illness &#8212;
probably several illnesses, starting with alcohol poisoning.
You can't have that much alcohol in your blood stream without being sick.
<p>
Then most of the hard-core, dying, alcoholics also have things like
cirrhosis of the liver, kidney damage, peripheral nerve damage,
brain damage, and a lot of other medical problems....
<p>
And then the American Psychiatric Association will say that they also have
mental illness number 305.00 &quot;Alcohol Abuse&quot;, and maybe also 303.90
&quot;Alcohol Dependence&quot;.

<p>
But that does not mean that they have a &quot;disease&quot; called
&quot;alcoholism&quot; that makes them drink alcohol and renders them
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<p>
It's just like how children who eat too much candy and ice cream get
sick from it. They may have illnesses like diarrhea, nausea, and a painful
belly-ache, but that doesn't mean that they have the &quot;spiritual
disease of candyism&quot; that forces them to eat candy and makes them
powerless over it.

<p>
By the way, if the AMA stated in 1956 that &quot;alcoholism was an illness&quot;,
and didn't get around to publishing an article in the JAMA that
actually defined the disease of &quot;alcoholism&quot; until 1992, did
they have an undefined &quot;disease&quot; for 36 years?
What definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot; were they using in 1956,
when they said that &quot;alcoholism is an illness&quot;?

<p><br>
Among the garbage that I am wading through on the AMA web site, trying to
find that definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot;, I see:

The definition of alcoholism. The Joint Committee of the National Council

</font>

R. M. Morse and D. K. Flavin<br>
National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, New York, NY 10010.
<p>
To establish a more precise use of the term alcoholism, a 23-member
multidisciplinary committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine conducted
a 2-year study of the definition of alcoholism in the light of current
concepts. The goals of the committee were to create by consensus a revised
definition that is (1) scientifically valid, (2) clinically useful, and
(3) understandable by the general public. Therefore, the committee agreed
to define alcoholism as a primary, chronic disease with genetic, psychosocial,
and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations.
The disease is often progressive and fatal. It is characterized by impaired
control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol
despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably
denial. Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic.<br>

<p>
Hmmm. What's wrong with this picture? Taken line by line, it seems mostly right,
but it still feels awkward, like something is off base. That just doesn't feel
quite right.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
There was no mention of the A.A. doctrine of alcoholism being a
&quot;spiritual disease&quot;, so they can't possibly be talking about
the same disease as the A.A. pundits are talking about.
<p>
<li> There was not a word about the etiology of the disease
&#8212; &quot;What causes it?&quot;<br>
We just got a vague statement that there are a lot of &quot;factors&quot; &#8212;
genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors.

<p>
<li>
There was no mention of alcoholics having any control over their lives, or
having any choice in the matter of whether to commit suicide by ethanol.

<p>
<li>
There was no mention of free will or will power,
just the implication that it is somehow missing in alcoholics &#8212;
&quot;It is characterized by impaired control over drinking&quot;.<br>
But that isn't the same thing as saying that alcoholics
are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<p>
<li>
There was no explanation of how this &quot;disease&quot; could cause
people to methodically drink themselves to death.
<p>
<li>
There was not even a hint of how it is possible for more than
50% of all alcoholics to suddenly one day say,
<font color="green">&quot;I've had it. I quit.&quot;</font>, and really do it.
&#8212; Which really conflicts with the &quot;loss of control&quot; theory.

<p>
<li> What about the alcoholics who are not in denial, like me?
In the last 17 years, I never denied being an alcoholic. I knew what the score
was, and I never lied about it. Too often, I did suffer from distorted thinking,
like imagining that the situation was hopeless because I was &quot;powerless over
alcohol and tobacco&quot;, just like the A.A. people said, so I might as well
just give up and die, and stay stoned until the bitter end.
(Thanks, A.A., for the twisted teachings that make people think that death
is the only way out.)
<p>
<li>
They say that the &quot;symptoms&quot; of alcoholism
&quot;may be continuous or periodic.&quot;<br>
That sort of sounds like the listed characteristics of alcoholism may be there,
or they might not be there.
What a perfect escape clause for all of the cases of alcoholism that don't
fit the stereotype.
<p>
(And the authors are also misusing the word &quot;symptoms&quot;, when they should
be saying &quot;signs of the disease&quot;, just like how Bill Wilson and
Marty Mann did.
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#symptom" target="_blank">We have been through this before</a>.
I really don't expect such errors from &quot;doctors&quot;.)

<p>
<li>
Oh, and I just realized what else is missing: It never says that
alcoholism is caused by drinking alcohol. That is a funny omission, isn't it?
Again we see the glaring absence of any statements about the etiology
of the &quot;disease&quot;.
<p>
It says that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is &quot;characterized by the use
of alcohol&quot;, but it does not say that drinking alcohol is the cause
of alcoholism.<br>
How could they leave that out?<br>
Do they imagine that alcoholism could possibly be caused by anything
other than drinking alcohol?<br>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
(Well yes, actually. The authors think that alcoholism has a
&quot;spiritual&quot; cause, because it is a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;,
but they aren't about the say that out loud, officially.)<br>
</i></font>

<p>
<li> Hey! Wait a minute! Did you see that line underneath the names of the
authors? I just noticed that.<br>
<b>&quot;National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence,
New York, NY 10010.&quot;</b><br>
That is the NCADD, the A.A. front group.
That organization was founded by Marty Mann for the sole purpose of promoting
Alcoholics Anonymous.
The American Medical Association actually let an A.A. front group define
alcoholism for them!
<p>
That's what's wrong with that definition of alcoholism.

I am looking at that headline again, and I realize that it
says:<br>
<b>&quot;The Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine&quot;</b>
<p>
The ASAM, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, is yet another A.A.
front group.
That definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot; was actually written by a joint committee
of two A.A. front groups.
<p>
ASAM was founded by Dr. Ruth Fox, the doctor who liked to dose her
alcoholic patients with LSD to make them more obedient and compliant. No joke.
Really. The sole purpose of ASAM is to promote the 12-Step treatment of
alcoholics, and to fool doctors into thinking that it is good medicine.
Then Dr. Ruth Fox had quite a career of unsuccessfully treating alcoholics
while proclaiming great success.

some of her patients nearly died from it.

Oh, and
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Talbott" target="_blank">a recent president of ASAM,
Dr. G. Douglas Talbott, used 12-Step torture to drive other
doctors and nurses to suicide</a>.
He set up a treatment center in Atlanta, Georgia,
that specialized in treating medical professionals who had drug and alcohol problems
&#8212; doctors, nurses, and dentists.
Talbott's patients had a horrendous suicide rate, and Talbott
was finally put out of business when
<a href="orange-letters.html#Talbott" target="_blank">he was successfully sued for
false diagnosis, false imprisonment, and torture of another doctor</a>.

<ul>
<li> Marty Mann, the first woman to get
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#woman_stay" target="_blank"><i>and stay</i></a> sober

By the way, you should know that the A.M.A. is not the official spokesman for
all doctors, or the final arbiter in matters of medicine, or the supreme authority
on medical issues. The A.M.A. is merely
a club for doctors &#8212; just another association that hires lobbyists and
pushes its positions on things. The last numbers that I heard indicated
that maybe half of all doctors join the A.M.A.. Some doctors strongly
oppose the A.M.A. because of some of its policies.
<p>
<a name="Fishbein"> </a>
The A.M.A. has a very checkered past. From 1924 to 1949, the A.M.A.
was headed by a tyrannical leader, Morris Fishbein,
who built it up from basically nothing to the
dominant organization that it is now by, among other things,
practicing blackmail on pharmaceutical companies and forcing them to
buy very expensive full-page ads for their medicines in the
JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association), or else he wouldn't let
the A.M.A. recommend their medicines.
Eventually, Morris Fishbein was convicted of racketeering.
<p>
The A.M.A. has been repeatedly busted for violation of anti-trust laws and
found guilty of restraint of
trade and anti-competitive practices, and not just in the distant past, either.
They have a long history of choosing money and power over public health.
There is much about the history of the A.M.A. that is sleazy and sordid.
<p>
So just because the A.M.A. says something doesn't mean that it is true,
or that it is reliable information. The primary goal of the A.M.A. has been,
and probably still is, to make itself and doctors rich.

<a name="APA_endorsement"> </a>
<p><br>
Back to Mr. Yoast's letter:<br>
The statement that the DSM-IV supports the disease theory of alcoholism 
is a lie. Period. That is a grossly dishonest and deceptive statement.
That is not a matter of a small misunderstanding.
The writer had to know what he was saying, if he was at all qualified to speak
for the American Medical Association.
The writer had to know what was in the DSM-IV that he was referring to.

<p>
The American Psychiatric Association did not endorse the idea that
alcoholism is a disease. They have consistently refused to do so.
The APA has been very careful not to use the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
because the word is so ill-defined and politically loaded.
Rather than admit that,
the AMA mouthpiece just tried to snow you by referring you to the DSM-IV,
and implying that it also supported the AMA idea of &quot;alcoholism the disease&quot;.

<p>
The APA defined two <i>alcohol-use</i> <b>mental disorders</b>: Alcohol Abuse,
and Alcohol Dependency,
and 13 <i>alcohol-induced</i> disorders like intoxication, withdrawal, delusions,
dementia, and sexual dysfunction.
<a href="orange-DSM-IV-195.png" target="DSMwin">
<!-- height=1444 width=900 border=0 -->
Look here for an image of the actual DSM-IV page</a>.

<p>
Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Dependency are
pretty much what they sound like.
Alcohol Abuse is the mental disorder where someone habitually consumes so much
alcohol that it is wrecking his health,
and Alcohol Dependency is being addicted to alcohol.
<p>
Now that makes sense. If you are habitually drinking so much alcohol
that it is killing you, then you really do need your head examined.
<p>

But the APA never used the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;, nor did they
say that it was a disease. I have looked in the
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#dsm3" target="_blank">DSM-III-R</a>,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#dsm4" target="_blank">DSM-IV</a>,
and DSM-IV-TR (Text Revision), and the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;
isn't listed as a disease, and it isn't even in the index.
I haven't found it anywhere in any of those books, and I have looked hard.
They just won't touch that nasty word with a ten-foot pole.
And Mr. Yoast must have known that when he wrote that answer to you.
<p>
Furthermore, what the Steppers do is a bait-and-switch trick. They will
tell you that the AMA or the APA agree that &quot;alcoholism is a disease&quot;,
and then they pull a switcheroo and shove at you the A.A. definition of
&quot;<a href="orange-letters20.html#alcoholism_causes" target="_blank"><i>alcoholism,
the spiritual disease that is caused by sin and
selfishness and moral shortcomings and defects of character, all
of which must be listed and confessed to someone else</i></a>&quot;,
which is something that neither the AMA nor the APA ever endorsed.

<p>
Thanks again for a great question and an interesting letter.
<p>
And I still have to get to the hospital library and find the full text of
that Morse-Flavin article. That should prove interesting. More on that later.

<p>
Why is a man who should be serving life in prison for torture appointed
by President George W. Bush as Ambassador to Italy?

<p>
On Thursday's show, This Bush Crony Has Blood on his Hands!
&lt;http://radioinsidescoop.com/mt-posts-archive/000504.html&gt;, THE INSIDE
SCOOP was the first radio show to report on STRAIGHT, Inc., the teen-age
rehab center more akin to a torture/concentration camp run by Melvin and
Betty Sembler. Melvin Sembler was for many years until a few months ago,
George W. Bush's U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

<p>
The testimonials from victims of this place were so horrific and so
numerous that we barely scratched the surface. So reporter *John
Gorenfeld* has agreed to come back to discuss this story this Sunday.

<p>
My second guest, *Dr. Arnold Trebach*, Justice Chief for the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission during the Civil Rights Era of 1960-65, is Professor
Emeritus at American University and Founder of The Drug Policy
Foundation in Washington, DC. For two decades, Dr. Trebach has been
investigating STRAIGHT.

<p>
My third and most important &quot;guests&quot; are the many survivors of Sembler's
torture and abuse that have agreed to call in as well.

<p>
You won't want to miss today's show!

Subject:  	My Own Experience

<p>
When I went to Iraq (compliments of the Arkansas Army National Guard),
October 2003, I attended my last meeting, the day before I left. Did I
get any cards or letters from them? No way! After writing to my group
several times while I was there, I gave up on them. I did, however, get
a lot of letters and packages from people that I did not know, none in
AA. I got back from Iraq March 2005. I did see one person that attended
the same meetings I attended before I left. She ignored me.

<p>
I then found out why, through a person that had attended the same
meeting but stopped going. They were mad because I was getting married
when I got back. This is no joke! There seems to be an anti-relationship
bias in AA now.

<p>
I have been clean and sober now for ten years. I can hardly be
considered a new comer. I did it all, including helping wet drunks get
into detox and hospitals (I still do this). I no longer attend AA, but I
still try to stay in contact with the people that I have tried to help
and I am someone they can talk to, when they need an ear to listen. I no
longer evangelize the 12 steps, but I still try to help others, which, I
suppose, is a good way to stay sober.

<p>
My history is this: Porno, gambling, alcohol, drugs (legal and illegal),
family history of alcohol and drug addiction, cult addiction, etc. You
name it, and if it wasted my time, effort, money, and energy, I did it.

<p>
In retrospect, I remember the meetings I went to and heard some
fantastic 'spiritual' stuff, yet many times these people who said that
stuff, were drunk, high, dead from a heroine over-dose, or had commited
suicide in a matter of weeks. And some of these were circuit speakers
and 'pillars' of the recovery community.

<p>
I think that the secret to my success of staying sober in AA was not the
steps (except for the part of helping others), but being around others
that were also at least staying sober.

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story. It says a lot. And congratulations on
your sobriety.
<p>
And as a fellow veteran, I also have to say to the public,<br>
<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The Republicans who control Congress are really screwing over the vets and
the guys currently serving in Iraq &#8212; not enough armor, not enough anything, reducing
combat pay, closing VA hospitals, defunding the VA.
Do you know how many military wives have to get food stamps to feed their children?
(And now the Republicans are cutting 300,000 people off of food stamps, too.)
That sucks big time. <b>Support the troops</b> by giving
them a BIG pay hike for Christmas, like a 100% increase in pay
(not some picayune 5% or 10%) and by actually
really funding the Veteran's Administration so that they can do things for the vets.
And <b>support the troops</b> by giving those worthless back-stabbing two-faced
politicians hell about it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What? You think that's too much of a pay raise? Don't you think they are worth it?<br>
How much would we have to pay you to get you to go over there and duck bullets
and dodge bombs?
</blockquote>

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Wow, I have never seen so much energy placed into an anti-12 step tirade
before.  If you put � the energy into working the **program** of AA as
you did into penning this drivel, not only would you have **recovered**
by now (yes, permanent recovery is guaranteed ? read page 85.  Don?t
dissect;  don?t analyze ? READ it), but you would have helped countless
others.

<p>
Good luck.<br>
David W. R.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi David,
<p>
Why on earth would I want to &quot;work the program&quot;?<br>
I have 5 years of sobriety without A.A. or the 12 Steps or &quot;working the program&quot;,
so I have no need for cult religion or quack medicine.
<p>
And it doesn't matter what it says on page 85 of the <i>Big Book</i>.
Bill Wilson was crazy. That book is worse than worthless.
Bill was merely writing down his delusions, like:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And that &quot;miracle&quot; is immediately followed by:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve
contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day
is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our
daily activities.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions,
William G. Wilson, Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, page 85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hmmm... Not a miracle at all.<br>
And the &quot;without any thought or effort on our part&quot;
has turned into a lifetime of slave labor in just the space of one paragraph.
<p>
Yes, page 85 is quite a trip.<br>
Bill was definitely off of his meds that day.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Maybe I'm just too smart to be a stupid, simple addict, but I have had a
great deal of success and personal growth as a result of working several
12 step programs.  I have never had any particular definition of god
forced on me, have never been demeaned, discounted or shamed.  The steps
have wording that can be difficult to overlook, but the results of
self-examination and taking responsibility have created maturity in my
personality.  I have taken part in many varied forms of spirituality,
behavior modification, psychotherapy and tried quitting on my own.  So
far I am in the longest period of abstinence of my life since starting
intoxicants and I credit the NA program for that.  The hostile tone of
your text indicates many things to me and I feel sorry for you.  How
dare you call this a cult when not everyone has the same experience in it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Linda,
<p>
Congratulations on your success in getting off of drugs.
<p>
The fact that you enjoy your meetings does not mean that
<ol>
<li> they are good for other people, or that
<li> N.A. and A.A. should be forced on other people for their own good, or that
<li> the meetings actually cure drug or alcohol problems, or that
<li> your N.A. meetings made you quit drugs, or that
<li> Steppism is not a cult.
</ol>

<p>
Your statement that you tried a lot of things, and couldn't quit drugs,
and then you did, reveals that it was another learning experience.<br>
It usually is.<br>
If at first you don't succeed, then try, try again.
<p>
Eventually you got sick and tired of being sick and tired, and decided to really quit,
rather than just sort-of try.

<p>
You imagine that N.A. is responsible for your staying off of drugs, but that is
simply a groundless assumption. You give the credit to N.A. because you just
happened to be in N.A. when you quit drugs.
<p>
Did you try anything else after you quit drugs?<br>
Did you try any more of the behavior modification, psychotherapy, or spirituality?
<p>
No, of course not.
<p>
So you didn't even give anything else a chance, did you?
<p>
You overlook the simple fact that nothing &quot;worked&quot; until you quit drugs,
and then, after you quit, anything would have &quot;worked&quot;.
<p>
Yes, I sometimes have a hostile tone. I think that harming people, and even occasionally
killing people, with quack medicine and cult religion is a despicable crime.
I think that deceiving people in the name of God is really low and vile.
<p>
If you want to read stories from some other people who didn't enjoy their
meetings as much as you enjoy yours, you should read
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors" target="_blank">the other letters that I receive</a>.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  The Funny Spirituality of Bill Wilson and A.A.<br>

<p>
Just a remark about your article
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">The Funny Spirituality
of Bill Wilson and A.A.</a>&quot;
With the grace and love of the program of AA I have been
drug and alcohol free for 21 years. The shortest paragraph of the Big
Book is on page 88 and it states &quot;It works &#8212; it really does&quot;.

<p>
Here is a reply to an Email I received asking me what I thought about
the article.
<p>
Namaste'

<p>

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

If you want me to read the whole of the article then that may take
awhile, but right off I realized that the writer (A. Orange) is using
today's insights and knowledge of smoking to a time of the past.
Clearly this is not logical and questions arise of the writers own state
of mind.  If only we knew then what we know now type of remark. Quite
frankly (pun intended) with that observation it makes me wonder why I
should read anymore. But I will if you really want me to.

<font color="blue">
Hi Eagle,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your years of sobriety.
Of course I strongly disagree about the cause of your sobriety.
I think that you finally quit drinking because you decided to.

<p>
Now about Don's letter:<br>
Brother is that answer a classic cop-out &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;using today's insights and knowledge of smoking to a time of the past.&quot;
</font>
That is just a lame excuse for Bill Wilson being stupid in 1939.

<p>
As if people in 1935 or 1940 or 1950 weren't able to notice that their throats and chests hurt
from smoking? As if they weren't able to notice that smoking made colds and flues and
bronchitis worse? As if they couldn't notice that smoking cut down on their wind
and made them wheezing and short of breath? (They did notice it. Bill even
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">complained on that page</a>
that the alcoholic's wife was complaining about his smoking,
and trying to get him to quit.)
<p>
And then Bill and his fellow Steppers claimed that they were
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">getting Guidance from God
while practicing Step 11</a> &#8212; so, what? &#8212; was God too stupid in 1940
to notice that smoking damages people's lungs and wrecks their health and gives
them cancer? Didn't God ever say to Bill Wilson,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;You should quit smoking that evil weed?&quot;<br>
</font>
Or was Bill Wilson just not listening to God?
<p>
Oh, and Don
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert" target="_blank">
dodged all of the other important points</a> in that web page,
like how could Bill Wilson
claim that the guy who chain-smoked and threw screaming drunken temper
tantrums to get his own way was &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;a most effective member of
Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;, while his clean and sober (and non-smoking)
wife was just an unspiritual nag who needed to learn real spirituality
from her alcoholic husband? That's insane.
<p>
Then Don complains that my logic is bad?
<p>
If we follow Don's logic, we should throw away the entire 12-Step program
because that is just the primitive knowledge of the past, not up to par
with today's medical knowledge, and we should not apply it to the problems
of today.
<p>
And you know, that is a conclusion that I can agree with.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Just an Opinion<br>
Date:  	Sat, November 19, 2005 7:33 pm

<p>
Dear A. Orange,

<p>
I visited your &quot;The Heresy of the Twelve Steps web site and I can
offer you this:  I'm a believing, practicing Christian who has been
troubled with sexual addiction all my life.  Though my Lord and my God
were hearing my cries for help, I wasn't really listening for His reply
because I felt that I was unworthy of help. I knew about &quot;surrender&quot; as
a Christian, but I had never learned how to do it.   When I met the
local crowd from Sexaholics Anonymous, a lot of things fell into place
that never had before.  I am now happier in my service to God and my
church than ever before because, with the help of my Lord, simply
beginning the twelve-step program opened my eyes to His truths.  I'm
back in the fold, praise the Lord!

<p>

We use expressions such as &quot;God /as we understood him/&quot; because many
addicts are afraid of God and are reluctant to approach Him because they
feel they are unworthy.  Many sinners approach cautiously &quot;/as we
understand him/&quot; and come to the Light, the Truth and the Way as a result.

<p>

I'm sorry you feel that twelve-step programs are heresy.  To you the
programs may be heresy, but to me, Sexaholics Anonymous is a lifesaver.
I was afraid to call out to my God for help, so I called out to men like
myself.  They turned me right back around and taught me how to listen
for the answers to my prayers.  To me, the twelve-step program was a
program through which God spoke to me.

<p>

A quotation from a fellow named Herbert Spencer:  &quot;There is a
principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against
all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting
ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to investigation.&quot;

<p>
Your friend,

<br>
Philip T.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Dear Philip,
<p>
You shouldn't be sorry that I feel that twelve-step programs are heresy.
<p>
You should be sorry that the twelve-step programs <i>really are</i> heresy,
and you are practicing it.
<p>
What part of the file &quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of
the 12 Steps</a>&quot; did you not understand?
<p>
Just because you have become a happy true believer in 12-Steppism doesn't mean that
you are practicing Christianity, or that Steppism is a good religion.
<p>
Please read the entire file
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>&quot; again.

<p>
Oh, and while you are examining all of the facts, you really should also read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>, the whole thing, questions and answers.

<p>
And yes, I know all about the quote from Herbert Spencer.
<a href="index.html" target="_blank">I begin my web site with it</a>.
And the reason it is there is, Herbert Spencer had to constantly exhort the
true believers to actually look at all of the facts before making up their minds
about things.
Then, as now, there were a whole lot of people who didn't want to actually
look at all of the facts and think about them for a while. They were narrow-minded
and prejudiced and they just wanted to believe what they already believed.
<p>
Nothing has changed.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We use expressions such as &quot;God /as we understood him/&quot; because many
addicts are afraid of God and are reluctant to approach Him because they
feel they are unworthy.&quot;
</font>
<p>
So, you admit that you don't tell the newcomers the truth about your
religious beliefs. You use &quot;expressions&quot; to give newcomers
&quot;the right impression&quot; and lead them to believe that they
can be comfortable in your religion. You hide the truth about A.A.
behind &quot;expressions&quot;, slogans, and misleading language to keep
them from shying away from your program. Your attitude towards the
newcomers is,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;The truth? You can't handle the truth!&quot;</font>
<p>
There is a name for that practice.
It is called <i>deceptive recruiting</i>.
It is a form of dishonesty &#8212; deceiving people about the real religious
nature of the A.A. program.
Just feed the newcomers some happy pablum &#8212; soft-peddle the religiosity &#8212;
tell them anything to keep them coming back.
Tell them that they can believe in any kind of a god or &quot;higher power&quot;
that they want, or that they can believe in nothing at all.
Use euphemisms and &quot;expressions&quot; and misleading language to mask what A.A. really is.
<p>
Only reveal the truth to the newcomers later, after they have become committed members.
And only reveal the truth about the organization and the real program
a tiny bit at a time, so that they don't freak out and run away.
<p>
There is nothing moral or spiritual about that behavior. It's a standard cult practice,
and it's listed in the Cult Test &#8212; item 25, Deceptive Recruiting.
See
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">the question here</a>,
and 
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">the answer for A.A., here</a>.<br>
And that practice also shows cult characteristic number 33:
&quot;Newcomers can't think right.&quot;<br>
<font color="#8f0000">
<i>&quot;In the opinion of the elders, the newcomers cannot think right.
The elders believe that they are justified in practicing deceptive recruiting
to get new people to join their group, precisely because the newcomers
cannot think correctly, so it doesn't really matter what the newcomers
are told, or what they think, anyway.&quot;</i></font><br>
See <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">the question here</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">the answer for A.A. here</a>.
<p>
That practice is grossly heretical and unChristian. Jesus didn't teach his followers,<br>
<font color="green">
&quot;Fib to the newcomers, and don't talk openly and plainly about the God stuff, or
else you might scare them away before we have a chance to convert them.
Make up expressions to mask our real religious beliefs.&quot;<br>
</font>
Um, no. What happened to that much-mentioned A.A. &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;?

<p>
Bill Wilson described that process very clearly and explicitly:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only
little by little. They simply did not want to get &quot;too good
too soon.&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank">
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts</a> &#8212; absolute
purity, absolute honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212;
were frequently too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed
with teaspoons rather than by buckets.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 74-75.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill felt that he was spiritually superior to, and better than, the newcomers,
because they didn't like
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">the fascism that was inherent in the Oxford Groups cult</a>,
while Bill the High Holy Alcoholic had no problem with it.
When the newcomer alcoholics refused to accept the authoritarian behavior of the
Oxford Group leaders, and rejected Bill's Buchmanite cult religion,
Bill Wilson arrogantly sneered at the alcoholics, and said that
<font color="#4f007f">
'They simply did not want to get &quot;too good too soon&quot;'</font>.
That made Bill feel justified in only doling out the truth about his
version of Buchmanism to the newcomers &quot;by teaspoons, not buckets&quot;.
<p>
And finally, two pages later, Bill Wilson wrote that he had an ulterior motive all along.
His <i>real purpose</i> wasn't to help the alcoholics to sober up....
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font> is to fit
ourselves to be of maximum service to God
and the people about us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">

<p>
Yes, it really is a cult.

Subject:  	Twelve Step Programs

<p>

I read most of the article you have on the Internet regarding the
ineffectiveness of 12 step programs.  I thank you for the insights..  I
am admittedly an alcoholic and told my new doctor such this week.  Of
course he wanted to send me to AA right away and told me that was the
solution to my drinking problems.  I explained to him that I had been
through AA several times over the years and that my success rate was
zero.  I suffer from depression and listening to these people made it
worse.  They had nothing to offer me.  I have sent him your article but
I expect it will do no good.  I know that if I'm going to stop drinking
that it will be with the support of my wife and I will do it on my own.
Hopefully I'll be one of the 5% that make it through.  I've been through
rehabs, Naltrexone, Antabuse, etc. and it doesn't last.  Maybe one of
these days I'll clean up my act for the sake of my family but the 12
step programs are a complete failure.  Thank you for your insightful
article.

Hi Chris,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments, and welcome to the club.
<p>
A big part of getting it together to quit and stay quit is increasing your
motivation to quit. I like the way that
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320021016/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>
puts emphasis on that.
You should check them out. You will find SMART meetings to be a breath of fresh air
after 12-Step meetings.
<p>
Also check out all of the rest of the
<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">pro-recovery resources on the links page</a>.
<p>
And read about the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
Understanding his mind games as he tries to get me to relapse has been a huge
help in staying sober.
<p>
Good luck, have a good day, and don't hesitate to write back if you feel like it.

Subject:  	Gratitude &#8212; On Thanksgiving AND The Other 365 Days!<br>
Date:  	Mon, November 21, 2005 11:23 am<br>

<p>
Have a great Thanksgiving! I came across this article about gratitude on
MySpace, and thought it was timely and true. I know when I let go of
fear and stay open, opportunities I yearn for start showing up without
much effort on my part.

<p>
<center><table width="94%" border="5" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

The next time you wonder why something you want is not showing up in
your life ask yourself &quot;Am I available?&quot; Because all you really need is
to be available. Spirit is pouring out Its blessings all the time.
Spirit is infinite giving, infinite opportunities, infinite
possibilities, infinite goodness.

<p>
But Spirit can only give to us the extent that we accept, because it
pours its goodness out through us and as us. So we prepare ourselves to
be available. We increase our ability to be available. We get still and
go within to that secret sacred place within all of us where the truth
of our being is so clear. We become fully present to whom and what we
really are. We open up our heart, our mind, and even our soul. In the
awareness of our oneness with Spirit we are able to release anything
from our lives that does not serve us. We let go of anger, resentment,
worry, lack of forgiveness, fear, or whatever it is that is blocking
the flow of good from coming into our lives. By releasing these things
we create a greater opening for the good we desire. Our consciousness
shifts and our availability increases. Now we can simply relax, let go,
and remember that we are being held in the loving embrace of Spirit.

<p>
AFFIRM: I am available for Spirit to express Its goodness in and as my
life right now.

Subject:  	truth.<br>
Date:  	Sun, November 20, 2005<br>

<p>
howdy from austin texas. my name's kevin and i was recently charged with
DWI.  i haven't been to court yet, but as a condition of my release on p.r.
bond i must attend a.a. meetings thrice a week. While googling 'why we were
chosen' on the advice of my over-eager sponsor, i fortunately landed on the
orange papers.  Thank god for you. &lt;i already developed a contact with my
higher power navigating hallucinigens and teenagism&gt;.  Whoa are you on the
money!!

<p>
I never attempted quitting alcohol or drugs until this last arrest.
I'm 32 and after 18 years of drinking and drugging i was/am ready for life to
change. I honestly think  i have spontaneously remitted.  But people in a.a.
including my temp sponsor, whom i fired yesterday, won't hear of it!! they
quote the &quot;big book&quot; and say 'maybe you should try some more controlled
drinking,'..etc.  Yeah! what about the solution to my drinking problem?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Kevin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. Sorry to hear about your difficulties.
I'm glad to hear that you are otherwise
okay. And congratulations on the quitting.
<p>
The reason that the sponsors don't want to talk about spontaneous remission is because
it means that you don't need them. The whole A.A. thing is pointless and unnecessary
when you find that 80% of all of the successful quitters do it alone, without
any support group or treatment program. (The Harvard Medical School said that,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">here</a>.)
</font>

<p>
you are
so dead on, and the more i research your site the more i see it. i have probably
been to 45 meetings or so.. the thing is I haven't even been to court yet, and
I'll probably get some probation with mandatory meetings.

<p>
I was wondering if
you've ever heard of someone requesting the rep. voice rec. or some other
meetings/treatment in place of a.a. and if it is possible. I guess i should ask
my lawyer, but he seems to be pretty a.a. friendly &lt;his son is in a.a.&gt;

<p>
<font color="blue">
The answer is &quot;Absolutely YES!&quot;
You can start with my short write-up of legal cases and judges' decisions,
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
And then you can look at Ken Ragge's web site, &quot;More Revealed&quot;, and get the
actual decisions of a bunch of critical cases where high court judges, including
the Supreme Court, ruled that A.A. was a religious organization, or engaged in
religious activities.
Go to:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320021016/http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html" target="_blank">
http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html</a> &#8212; Archive of documents, including the legal
decisions that declared that A.A. was engaging in religious ceremonies,
and that sentencing someone to go to A.A. meetings was unconstitutional.
<p>
It is blatantly illegal and unconstitutional to sentence anyone to A.A. meetings.
The judge must also allow a non-cult-religion alternative, like SMART or something.
You can get a list of the SMART meetings from their web site:
<p>
SMART</a>: <i>Self Management And Recovery Training</i>.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160320021016/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.smartrecovery.org/</a><br>
Rational, sane, common-sense recovery techniques.
Based on Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, the brainchild
of Dr. Albert Ellis.<br>
Also see his book,
<a href="orange-top10.html#Ellis" target="_blank">
<i>When AA Doesn't Work for You, Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol</i></a>.

<p>
The big problem is just that some judges are married to A.A., for various
reasons. Some are members themselves, although they won't admit it in public.
Some, like your lawyer, have relatives in it. Some are just grossly misinformed
and are convinced that it is a good thing that produces lots of success stories.
And some judges know the truth, but use A.A.-based programs by default because
that's all there is in their area.

<p>
When a judge insists that YOU WILL go to a 12-Step meeting, it is questionable
how much you wish to incur the wrath of the judge by arguing with him.
Legally, you are right, and legally, he can still screw you into the
ground. So proceed cautiously and respectfully.
</font>

<p>
At least thanks to you i know I won't get duped!!  Hahahaha... I have tried some
questions about the cult aspect and the responses are as you describe.  I feel
so sad for some of these people!! I just can't believe i have to continue to
go..

<p>
Thank You So Much for your time and effort!  Your efforts have saved my
mind.  and thanks for your time

<p>
p.s. the quote about 'all that is required for evil to triumph over good is that
good men do nothing' i read as being ascribed to Ghandi. you probably know that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I wasn't really sure where that quote came from. Thanks for the tip.
</font>
<p>

THANK YOU ORANGE. DON'T KEEP IT A SECRET!!!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for all of the thanks. And it isn't so much of a secret any more.
Google has been pretty good
about putting me high up on their lists. I was very surprised to discover that one of
my web pages was the first choice on a &quot;children's gulags&quot; Google search.

Have a good day, and good luck.

Date:  Tue, November 22, 2005 12:52 am<br>
From:  &quot;Andrew&quot;<br>
Subject:  more mail for you<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange

<p>
I forget how I first came across your site, but at the time I regarded
it as the disordered rant of someone who'd got a resentment at AA and
gone out and drunk again, but not so much as to prevent him producing a
website. Recent events mean that I'm less sure.

<p>
The revelations about the Oxford Group come as no surprise &#8212; I bought a
second-hand copy of Driberg's 'The menace of Moral Re-Armament' in my
student days years ago and wish to God it hadn't been one of the books I
sold in a job lot, ostensibly for living expenses during one of my long
periods of unemployment, but in fact to help fund my drinking. I had
always assumed, though, that AA and Bill Wilson had been veritable
beacons of light in comparison with the odious Buchman, but such was
obviously not the case.

<p>
I have had two spells in AA &#8212; the first a brief one six years ago, which
ended when I couldn't handle my mother's illness and death and drank
again for a year, the second starting just over five years ago through a
treatment centre, since when I have been actively involved in 'the
rooms', have stayed sober and enjoyed more success than I ever had
before. I have been secretary of two meetings, one after the other, the
first in London and the second near my home some forty miles outside it,
and I am now GSR of a meeting in my home town, which fortunately is not
too onerous a commitment.

<p>
Happy though I have generally been in AA, there have been a number of
'revelations' which have given me pause for thought, but about which I
do not feel free to speak openly. I have had two sponsors and have done
the steps after my own rather eccentric fashion, which the hardliners
would tell me is no way to do it, so I tend not to share about that and
avoid meetings (like step meetings) at which I might have to.

<p>
My first sponsor was someone I met during my first attempt at sobriety,
who made the effort to keep in touch with me even while I was out
drinking (which is more than anyone else has ever done), and that is
what prompted me to ask him to sponsor me. As he worked shifts as a
night watchman in another town, our sponsor/sponsee relationship was
conducted almost exclusively over the phone, and he was enormously
supportive.

<p>
Nearly two years into sobriety, I decided to return to the practice of
the Christian faith, which I had abandoned during my drinking, and about
which my treatment centre had been highly disparaging, taking the view
that my God had not kept me sober and so all pretence at believing in
Him should be abandoned. Returning to active membership of the Church of
England (i.e. Episcopalian) for me involved making my confession in
order to be able to make my communion at Easter. I therefore booked an
appointment at a church in London, wrote out all the things I had done
wrong since my last confession many years before (when a monk had
advised me to go to AA!) plus a few from my youth that I'd
half-deliberately forgotten about, and went and did the deed. I did this
without telling my sponsor, at least until afterwards (yet another black
mark in the eyes of the step-Nazis!) but when I did, he simply said,
'congratulations, you've done step 5'. This thing that everyone in
meetings bangs on about being so horrendously difficult I had done just
like that! But this is something I have never felt able to share about
openly, as it is quite clear from everything said by everyone else that
sacramental confession is a no-no, and the practice of the Christian
religion a sign of being in the problem rather than the solution.

<p>
My then sponsor left the fellowship, basically over the 13th-stepping
that goes on and which horrifies him. He hasn't been to a meeting for
over two years, but he hasn't had a drink, holds down a job, has been
sacked from a job for refusing to be dishonest (that's what I call
working a program of rigorous honesty), goes to church and raises money
for charity. Dry drunk or what? And what a contrast to so many of those
regarded around here as winners with whom one should stick, who waste
their qualifications, live on state benefits and spend all their time
going to AA meetings.

<p>
My second sponsor was/is a woman who talked me into sacking sponsor #1
on the grounds that if he wasn't going to meetings, he was a dry drunk
and should be avoided. I bitterly regret that. It has to be said that
she was very helpful when my father died last year, but she basically
regarded me (like so many men in the rooms) as a meal ticket, and I was
fool enough to fall for it. She habitually walks out of jobs and is
heading for bankruptcy, but treats herself to exotic foreign holidays
several times a year, paid for on a succession of credit cards that she
obtains by I know not what means, but probably dishonest ones.

<p>
After my father died, I inherited a certain amount of money. Obviously,
I shared that with her, as you have to, and she advised me not to share
about it openly as people would only start poncing money off me. Then,
when I got back from a holiday in Belgium a couple of months later (at a
time when she was on one of her jaunts in Italy) she asked me to lend
her a thousand pounds to pay the rent. Not thinking it very likely that
I'd ever get the money back, I refused, and she promptly sacked me (by
text message!), called me 'judgmental' and forbade me to contact her or
turn up to any of the meetings to which she goes, which include the one
in London of which I used to be secretary and where I have (had?) the
best friends I had in the fellowship. What do you make of that? Funny
how you only really become wise to what's wrong with something when it
affects you personally?.

<p>
I now frequently revisit your site and Jack Trimpey's, whose book on
Rational Recovery is my current bedside reading. Much of it tallies with
the thinking I have developed over my time in AA. I am seriously
thinking about leaving the fellowship outright, although I don't want to
cause inconvenience to the friends I am helping out by doing the GSR job
 &#8212; they are among the good guys in the rooms and there are a lot of them
I would miss and who would not be allowed to be in touch with me if I
left.

<p>
To those who would say to me that I haven't really done the steps I
would ask. &quot;Then how come I'm still sober?&quot; Still sober, despite having
gone through losing an uncle and a father, a pet cat, losing one job and
getting another, doing such forbidden things as going on holiday
somewhere where there are no AA meetings, staying away from meetings.
Still sober, despite being cold-shouldered by many of the fellowship
(isn't it funny how you're told to 'pick up the phone' all the time, yet
nobody ever phones you?). Still sober and holding down the same job for
four years, even though someone told me I should give up work, sign on
for benefits and devote my life to meetings in order to stay sober?
Well, I am. God (and I mean that literally) knows why.

<p>
I do hope you will find the time to reply to this. If you wish to add it
to your site, please omit my surname but feel free to mention that I am
in England.
