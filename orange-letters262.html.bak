<p>
Fine stats work, hope you sent the effort to AA. I argue the program works
if you work it. Aye there's the rub! Higher power? Thus the attrition rate.
Alcohol: cunning mischievous wuddever. I still booze. do you?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Private Party,
<p>
Declaring that &quot;It works if you work it&quot; is like declaring that dancing around in
a ballerina's tutu is a working cure for &quot;the disease of alcoholism&quot;.
It is true that if you always dance in a ballerina's tutu instead of drink alcohol,
whenever cravings for a drink strike,
then you will quit drinking and not have a problem with alcohol.
It works if you work it.
<p>
So does my Baskin Robbins cure. If you always eat ice cream instead of drink alcohol,
whenever cravings strike, then you will successfully quit drinking. It works if you work it.
<p>
And if you always go to an A.A. meeting instead of drink alcohol, then you will quit drinking.
It works if you work it.
<p>
But that nasty qualifier on the ends of those sentences, &quot;...if
you work it&quot; really means that
the &quot;program&quot; does not work at all. You must use your own will power and determination
to abstain from drinking alcohol, and then you must give the credit for your accomplishments
to something else that didn't do the work.

<p>
Why not just read The Orange Papers instead of drink alcohol?<br>
<i>It works if you work it,
you die if you don't, so work it, you're worth it. RARELY HAVE I seen a person fail,
who has thoroughly followed my path...</i>

<p>
By the way, no, I don't drink at all any more. I have about 10 3/4 years off of alcohol now.
Also the same time off of cigarettes and any other drugs.
I am so clean and pure these days that it borders on disgusting.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Clearly, you are not a fan of Bill W or AA. Personally, as an
alcoholic in recovery who has done some thorough step work and had
many spiritual experiences I find it par for the course for a nobody
like yourself to pick apart the sincere contributions of honest
people. The way you twist minor details to fit your point of view is
amusing to me. May God have mercy on your rotted soul.

Hello Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I have to ask, &quot;What <i>sincere contributions</i>?&quot;
Bill Wilson lied about everything from
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the A.A. cure rate</a>
to
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the history of A.A.</a>
to

to
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#no_infidelity" target="_blank">his cheating on his wife</a>.

<p>
It isn't &quot;picking apart sincere contributions&quot; when I show that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. has a failure
rate, not a success rate</a>.
Foisting ineffective quack medicine and deceptive cult religion on sick people and lying
about how well it works &#8212; or rather, does not work &#8212; is
a despicable crime, not a &quot;minor detail&quot;.

<p>
Perhaps you would like to read the file
<a href="orange-secrets.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Secrets of A.A.</a>
and tell me what I got wrong. Please pick just one and prove me wrong.
Of course, you must show your evidence and tell where you got it from.
And just parroting the lies of a cult religion is not evidence.

<p>
And above all, please answer this simple question:

Subject:  	Wow!<br>

<p>
Dude,

<p>
I have to commend you for the tireless reasearch you've made into the
&quot;character defects&quot; of Bill W. and the AA program. Doing so has probably
been cathartic and most likely helped you sober. Your own &quot;program&quot; so to
say. Indeed, Bill W. was a pretty complicated guy, and in no way a shining
example fo how I'd want to live and act. The good thing is that his sobriety
is not mine.

<p>
I don't think what you're doing is bad, and in fact, as a sober AA myself
have really learned a lot from your reaearch. I will say, however, that I am
a strong believer in the efficacy of the 12 step format and have personally
experienced every one of the AA promises and more.

<p>
You simply never experienced what that message is all about. There is
absolutely nothing wrong with that, and I'm sure you're doing quite well.
For me, the way I *felt* was the problem, and alcohol was the solution,
albeit a destructive one.  AA is not simply about quitting drinking, but
rather finding a way to think and live which doesn't require drinking to
bear. For that, AA is totally effective. You are obviously happy with what
you've got, so nothing more needs to be said.

<p>
My motive is not to argue, but simply recognize the impressive effort you've
made while missing the entire point of the program af AA.Keep at it, because
it seems to be keeping you're life directed.

<p>
Eric H.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Eric,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Here is the sentence that is the whole problem:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You simply never experienced what that message is all about.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no &quot;message&quot;. 
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#message" target="_blank">The Oxford Group claimed that their
cult had a &quot;message&quot;</a>, but
it was really just <i>&quot;worship Frank Buchman and give him your money.&quot;</i>
<p>
Bill Wilson learned that trick from Frank Buchman, so he jabbered about
&quot;the message&quot; a lot, and he died rich too.

<p>
The line in Step 12 about &quot;carrying the message&quot; is just an instruction to recruit more
victims into the cult.
The Oxford Group used the same line for the same purpose too.

<p>
Now this sentence is true:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For me, the way I *felt* was the problem, and alcohol was the solution,
albeit a destructive one.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes. I also felt terrible when I was drinking, and used alcohol as a
painkiller. The problem is that alcohol is very toxic and it's really
a very bad painkiller. In the end, it causes more pain than it cures.

<p>
Then your next two sentences are untrue:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA is not simply about quitting drinking, but
rather finding a way to think and live which doesn't require drinking to
bear. For that, AA is totally effective.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
A.A. is not effective at all. A.A. just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
A.A. pretends to be a solution to the problem of alcohol abuse, but it isn't.
Doing the 12 Steps and confessing all of your sins is not a cure for alcohol addiction.

<p>
Now I agree that if you want to really recover, then you must find a better way to live,
where you don't require constant doses of painkillers to make life bearable.
You must take better care of your health and develop a positive, balanced, lifestyle.
For me, that required quitting alcohol, all drugs, and also tobacco. The pain of cigarettes
killing me was a big part of the reason why I drank too much.
I also had to quit drinking rotgut black coffee that was giving me an ulcer.
(Latt&eacute; with milk is good. It won't burn a hole in your stomach.)

<p>
I hope you find what you need.
<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Meatbag&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Random Comments<br>

<p>
I've read a good deal of your site, and I'm looking through the letters
you published. I just finished reading
<a href="orange-letters7.html#pitch" target="_blank">your exchange with Pitch Black</a>
(I
must say that emails from AA true believers are interesting, to say the
least). Here's a fairly disjointed list of comments on various parts of
your site:
1. Here is a story you might find interesting. It's from an autistic woman who
started drinking because it helped her socialize with neurotypicals
and went to AA. Here's one of my favorite quotes on her AA post:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 I never got over my uneasiness with the exhortations to &quot;stop thinking
 so much&quot; and just do what I was told, just as I never adjusted to
 social expectations that were entirely outside my understanding and
 abilities<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this paragraph:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 When I think about this now, I understand how easily reason can be set
 aside in favor of anecdotal evidence. I heard the stories over and
 over: Beth comes to meetings every day, and she has been sober for 10
 years. Marie was sober for 10 years, too, but she stopped going to
 meetings a year ago and now she is drinking again. Rita did the same
 thing, and now she is dead. There was a seemingly endless supply of
 such stories. I was pretty sure that there were people who did not go
 to AA and still were sober, but eventually, I stopped asking questions
 because these questions, I was told, were a function of denial. Then
 there were those people who came around all the time and seemed to do
 everything recommended, but never seemed able to stay sober. There was
 an explanation for that. They were doing it wrong.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, these quotes are not really doing her post justice. Still, if
you want to publish this letter, I would prefer that you not include the
links. This is her story, and not mine, and I would rather not risk
having some true believers raid her fairly quiet blog, especially since
I don't think she knows about the Orange Papers.

<p>
2. The more I read this site, the more I believe that, were I to get in
the situation of having to choose between AA and jail, I would pick
jail. At least the jail would be more likely to make sure I stay on my
meds. I don't think I'm that likely to develop alcoholism or get
arrested for alcohol-related offenses, given that I don't even find
alcohol palatable, but I still wonder how I should handle that situation.

<p>
3. The first page I read was
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">the Snake Oil page</a>.
There, I found the grandchildren of alcoholics nonsense.
My reaction to that was: &quot;WTF?
These clowns expect me to believe I'm somehow damaged because a man I
happen to share genes with, and who died long before I was born, drank a
lot?&quot; While I do have depression, I would attribute that to having a
family history of depression on my mother's side (alcoholic grandfather
is my paternal grandfather) and some family drama that actually did
happen in my lifetime. I never needed a 12-step program. The combination
of CBT, Prozac, and somebody to remind me to take my meds everyday (I'm
autistic myself, so I have trouble remembering to take my meds by
myself) seems to work just fine. Actually, I haven't needed regular
therapy for a while, so it's mostly the meds at the moment.

<p>
4. One thing that amused me about Pitch Black is that, apparently, a
biography about Abraham Lincoln published in 1939 is obsolete and
invalid, but a book published in 1939 proposing a medical cure for
alcoholism is perfectly fine. This isn't Time Squad. History itself
doesn't magically change, even though how history is interpreted might.
In fact, I remember doing a project on populism in high school, and I
used a source that was a century old. I showed the source to my teacher.
He did point out the age of the source, but he agreed that it was a good
source. If anything, the source being old enough for the populism
movement to have occurred in the author's lifetime is actually kind of a
good thing in some ways.

<p>
Medicine, on the other hand, does change, even moreso during the course
of the 20th century. Even a very good doctor from the 1930s would be
lost in a modern hospital, and Bill Wilson was definitely not a very
good doctor. That, and psychiatry was in its infancy back in the 1930s.
It does annoy me that while most other areas of psychiatry have found
newer, better, less harmful treatments that are science-based, too many
doctors still treat alcoholics with what is essentially faith healing.
Even before reading your site, I was skeptical of AA since it did not
seem to be based on sound science. I realize now that that is a major
understatement.

<p>
5. It took me a while to figure out that &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; was referring
to alcohol. Distinguishing between your normal thoughts and the lizard
brain addiction thoughts, like you do, is one thing. I do something
similar when distinguishing between my own, healthy thoughts and the
distorted, harmful thoughts (you're not good enough, you're a terrible
person, you're defective, you're disgusting, you're lazy, you don't
deserve good things, you deserve bad things) resulting from the
depression. But how is turning something non-sentient into some sapient
supervillain helpful with recovery? For that matter, how is encouraging
the exact same distorted thoughts I listed through the 4th step helpful
with recovery. The answer for both questions is it doesn't.

<p>
6. I take it you've been sober for about 9-10 years now, right (haven't
reached your recent letters yet)? Congrats! Even better that you did it
without cult religion that is just as bad, if not worse, than alcohol.

<p>
7. If you read all this, thank you. If you want to publish this for some
reason, just refer to me as &quot;Meatbag&quot;.  It would be good for your
readers to know that I am, in fact, human, since I presume humans are
the majority of your readers, with a small minority of other organisms.
Robots don't tend to become alcoholics or join cult religions, so I
doubt many of them are reading. And yes, I do have a strange sense of
humor. I rather like that about myself.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Meatbag,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. You make a bunch of interesting points.
<p>
I especially relate to your first quote where the blogger said that she was very
uncomfortable with all of the appeals to stop thinking. That is what did it for me
too. That was the magic moment when the little light bulb went on in my head.
I was at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, and as the speaker exhorted us     
to stop thinking and just have faith in the program,
the little voice in my head said, &quot;This is just a cult.&quot;
<p>
Yes, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; is really archaic. Apparently, that was a popular slang
term for distilled liquors more than a century ago, especially in Great Britain.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<blockquote>
UPDATE: Wikipedia has a good page on &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;. It turns out to
be an ancient folk song that goes back to the fourteenth or fifteenth century in
England. With a macabre sense of humor, the old song makes the story of planting
and harvesting barley, and turning it into brew, into a grisley tale of murder
and dismemberment.  &quot;And they all agreed, John Barleycorn must die.&quot;
</blockquote>

</font>
<p>
And yes, FYI, I have been sober for about 10 3/4 years now. I've also been off of 
cigarettes and other drugs for the same time, too.  And without any cult religion
nonsense. It's really so simple: I just decided that dying that way was no fun.

<p>
Have a good day now.

I must say you have a well written rant about AA.
It's not based on any facts that I can find. But it's entertaining.
<p>
I have been around AA for quite a while at this point and some of the
&quot;members&quot; are pretty weird.
<p>
But you throw the baby out with the bathwater.
<p>
There is no religion in AA at all. Hell it's the opposite of a religion.
<p>
You seem to have had a very bad experience with some very bad people,
that's sucks.
<p>
But people like you do a very dangerous thing when you use vitriol to
disagree.

 for the rest of the list of books.

<p>
Of course A.A. is a religion. Half of the 12 Steps talk about God.
That is the same ratio as the Ten Commandments, half of which talk about God.

<p>
Now I know that Bill Wilson said that A.A. was not a religion. But he was
simply lying in order to get more recruits into his new cult.
That is a common cult practice. Cult routinely claim, &quot;Not a religion.
Just a philosophy of life. Just a fellowship. Just a
civic organization.&quot; The Moonies pulled the same stunt on Steve Hassan.
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#heavenly_deception" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>

Then Bill Wilson even wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that he had an ulterior motive,
that his <i>real purpose</i> was something other than recovery from alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose is to fit
ourselves to be of maximum service to God</font>
and the people about us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>Into Action</i>, page 77.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a religion.
<p>
Then, if you want proof positive that Alcoholics Anonymous is a religion,
try reading
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#12X12" target="_blank"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i></a>,
especially the crazy sermon where Bill Wilson declared that
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">the Seven Deadly Sins
lead to alcoholism</a>.
<p>
Also see these bait-and-switch tricks:
<p>

<p>
It is not irresponsible to criticize
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">quack medicine that kills more people than it helps</a>.
The claim that my criticism of A.A. is &quot;irresponsible&quot; and might kill alcoholics is a
very old line that A.A. members routinely use to try to avoid hearing the truth.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="_blank">Look here for many more of them</a>.
But since A.A. does not work at all, and just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate</a>,
telling the truth about A.A. is not hurting people, it is helping them.

<p>
Feel free to rebut my criticism of A.A. If you have any actual facts that I don't know,
then I'd like to hear them. But please, how about real facts, not A.A. misinformation
and nonsensical slogans, like the slogan that says that A.A. is &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot;,
and junk like that.

Have a good day now.

Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
Your &quot;Cult Test&quot; is simply the best attempt to define what constitutes a &quot;cult&quot; that
I've ever seen.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for the compliment.
</font>
<p>
You may be aware of this already, but I'll state it anyway:

<p>
One of your points, #25, is &quot;Deceptive Recruiting&quot;. Per your fascinating and
revealing look at AA's origins in Frank Buchman's teachings, I wondered if Buchman
deliberately let his cult be called &quot;The Oxford Group,&quot; since it sounds so much like
&quot;The Oxford MOVEMENT&quot;. The latter was a movement within the 19th Century Church of
England to restore the sacraments, liturgy, apostolic heritage and other &quot;Catholic&quot;
elements to Anglicanism. By the time Buchman first started his cult in England, the
Oxford Movement had become an important part of Anglican history and theology, and
had birthed the faction within the Church called &quot;Anglo-Catholicism&quot;. Of course,
High Mass and &quot;house parties&quot; have little in common, but the similar names may have
lent respectability to the Oxford Groups.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh, yes. The stealing of the prestige of the &quot;Oxford&quot; name was quite deliberate.
Contemporaries complained that Frank Buchman had no claim on the name Oxford, and
Buchman just basking in unearned reflected glory.
They said that it would be more accurate for Buchman to name his organization
&quot;The Penn State Group&quot; or &quot;The Kuling China Group&quot;.
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#Penn_State_Group" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
And there was more: the historical Oxford Group, which was formed a hundred
years earlier to define the philosophy and practices of the Church of England,
had just celebrated its 100-year anniversary, so the &quot;Oxford Group Movement&quot;
name was still fresh in people's minds when Buchman appropriated the name.
I'm sure that he benefited from the confusion that caused.

</font>
<p>
(A parallel here would be Scientology's NARCONON, which *sounds* like &quot;Narcotics
Anonymous,&quot; but is, as we both know, has nothing to do with 12-Stepping, and is just
another front for the Rondroids.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. That is a name rip-off too.
</font>
<p>
Thanks for time, and for your many insights about cultism.

<p>
Best,

<p>
Mike

<p>

Subject:  	Is AA a Cult?<br>

<p>
Wow, Orange.  You've obviously put a lot of time and energy into debunking AA.  AA
has never claimed to be the &quot;only way&quot; to achieve meaningful sobriety but it has
worked for many people, so what's the rub?  No one makes a person join; that's a
personal choice.  No one makes anyone leave (that, too, is a personal choice) and a
person is always welcome back if they choose to return.  AA doesn't go out and
recruit members; they show up on AA's doorstep whether voluntarily or at the urging
of family members or the courts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Katie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, A.A. claims to be the only way.
<p>
Now I know that Bill Wilson made some statements that sounded enlightened and
open-minded, about how A.A. has no monopoly, and A.A. isn't &quot;the only way by which
faith may be acquired&quot;, but that was just P.R. fluff to fool the outsiders into
joining. After they joined, the story changed. That is
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">Deceptive Recruiting</a>,
and it's a bait-and-switch trick.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>

</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">

page 28.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Changing the goal from &quot;quit drinking&quot; to &quot;acquire faith&quot;
is another bait-and-switch trick.)
<p>
But then the story changed to:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Any willing newcomer feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the

basis of life &#8212; or else.</font><br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

<p>

</ol>
<p>
</font>
<p>
Speaking of which, if someone is forced to do something they don't really want to do
(like attend AA at the judge's request), it seems natural they'd look for any reason
to discredit the program.  AA meetings today are full of resentful people coerced
into attending by the judicial system.  Many are drug addicts, not alcoholics, but
they're told to attend anyway.  The founders of AA were desperate, low-bottom drunks
facing insanity or death if they couldn't stay sober.  The gift of desperation is
what's missing in many of the people in AA today, whether they're attending
voluntarily or coerced into attending.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a good example of the propaganda and debating trick called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>Ad Hominem</i></a>  &#8212; 
just attack the critic and call him names and slander him,
rather than honestly addressing the issues that he talks about.
<p>
FYI: I am not a convict, or a low-life, and I have over 10 years of sobriety without
A.A. or any other lying cult religion.
I also have over 10 years off of cigarettes and any other drugs.
I'm quite happy, and I keep myself sober
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">by using simple common sense</a>,
like that dying of alcohol poisoning is really painful and no fun at all.
<p>
Then you claimed that &quot;The founders of AA were desperate, low-bottom drunks
facing insanity or death if they couldn't stay sober.&quot; That does not make them qualified
to design an alcohol addiction treatment program.
The fact that they were
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">such desperate, mentally-ill nutcases</a>
makes them very unqualified.
And their answer was sheer insanity: Join a cult religion and become obsessed with it
&#8212; become a
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung" target="_blank"><i>religiomaniac</i></a>.

</font>
<p>
I cannot fathom why you would spend so much time and energy discrediting AA unless
it's negatively impacted you in some way.  If it works for others, let it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The reason is very simple:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. kills more people than it helps</a>.
Foisting ineffective quack medicine and cult religion on sick people and lying to them
about how well it works &#8212; or rather, does not work &#8212; is a despicable crime.

I've always loved your site. You might be interested in this. I've
been baffled about how I keep finding very smart people in AA who have
absolutely no desire to think objectively about what is going on
there. This post and some of the links might explain it. On different
parts of your site you talk about how AA attracts
fascistic/authoritarian types. So here it all gets tied together.

Thanks for the question. And the answer is simple: To tell the truth about &quot;The Founder&quot;,

He was not a prophet or a spiritual man or even a wise man,
and he was not &quot;in constant contact with God&quot; when he did Step 11,

In his monomaniacal pursuit of self-aggrandizement, he didn't

Hello Marcus,

Thanks for the link, and congratulations on a great article.
I really like your core point: &quot;What harm is that abusive treatment doing?&quot;

And I think you are quite right when you say that the damage done by
abusive or &quot;confrontational&quot; therapy has not been medically
studied. I haven't seen any valid tests.
Abusing children is obviously something that the abusers do not want studied.

Subject:  	Thank you...<br>

<p>
Agent Orange,
<p>
my name is David (this is on my moms computer and her name is Carol).
<p>
I left AA about 4-6 months ago(and I have left about 12 times always
dedicated to never returning).  I started wanting to go for some
reason tonight when I know exactly what the nonsense meeting would be
like.
<p>
I had a motorcycle accident at the beginning of the week (and I
was stone cold sober) and I have been on Vicaden all week (prescribed
by the doctor).  They would accuse me of being drunk when the accident
happened (even though it was verified that I was sober) and they would
try to play doctor telling me what I should or shouldn't be doing with
my medication-even though I am out of Vicaden and I have no desire to
get any more.  I got scraped up pretty bad, no broken bones, not
paralyzed so I came out alright.
<p>
 I ended up not going and coming home
to read stuff from your anti AA websight.  Again, thank you for what
you do.
<p>
David

<p>
PS: how long does it take to be totally free of all emotional
attachment to AA?  I am a Nichiren Buddhist so everything in my
religious beliefs are in total opposition to what AA teaches (IE:I am
my higher power, I keep myself sober by chanting).  Yet, once in a
blue moon this still comes up, and I was in AA for about 10 years.  I
don't EVER want to go back and I want to be totally free because I see
that cult for what it really is.  Also, I'm not an SGI member any
more (for the same types of reasons).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello David,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I suspect that part of what
you call &quot;the emotional attachment to A.A.&quot; may actually be just the normal
human need to socialize. (And you won't ever get over that.)
Please check out &quot;the other groups&quot; that teach
safe and sane recovery methods. I just made the list into a separate file,
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">here</a>. You may find
some sensible and rational companionship there.
You can hang out with those people even if you don't need saving.
I think you will find some good people there. I did.

<p>
Speaking of which, it sounds like you are doing well. You aren't addicted to
opiates and you didn't nearly kill yourself by driving drunk.
Congratulations, and please keep it up.
<p>
You noticed how the A.A. people put you down. That is common. It's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#stigma" target="_blank">another standard A.A. bait-and-switch trick</a>.
At A.A., they say that they want to take away the stigma of alcoholism
and give you hope. But then they tell you that you have a disease that can't ever
be cured and you are just a selfish dishonest disgusting sinner who is <i>in denial</i>,
lying about &quot;your disease&quot;, and you have a thinking problem, etc...

<p>
That drives some people to suicide. No thanks.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you got out of SGI. I was in it for a short while too, and also
came to the conclusion that it was a cult. I described it in a few places, like

<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Gohonzon" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#Nichiren" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#Nichiren" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#Nichiren2" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#Nichiren3" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Now I still love Buddhism. I just don't belong to any group or organization.

<p>
<a name="candle"> </a>
About the chanting: I'd mix some silent Buddhist meditation in with the chanting,
for a change of pace and style. Baba Ram Dass taught meditating on a candle flame.
You just look at the candle flame, and count your breaths. In, one, then out, then In, two, then
out. And so on until you discover that some stray thought has grabbed your
attention and dragged it away, into the past or the future or somewhere else.
You were at 58, and now it is suddenly 72, and you have been somewhere else.
You just note what it was that got your attention
&#8212; <i>DO NOT</i> condemn yourself or criticize
yourself &#8212; then turn your attention back to the flame, and go back
to breathing and counting. You might do a hundred or a few hundred,
morning, or evening, or both.

<p>
The reason for not condemning yourself for being a bad meditator is
because it is counter-productive. (Never mind the fact that we all have to start where
we are.)
If you get into criticizing yourself, then instead of looking at the
candle flame, you will go off on a tangent about how bad you are
and how hopeless this is, and it will take forever to get good at this, and on and on...
Don't waste your time and energy doing that.
<p>
Just make a note of what grabbed your awareness and go back to the candle flame.
<p>
The reason for noting what grabbed your attention is because you are reconnecting the
thread of awareness, and you are learning about your desires. You are seeing what has
the power to grab your attention. You will eventually map out and learn about all of your
desires.
<p>
The goal is just to increase your ability to stay here and now.
It's an exercise, not much different from doing pushups and pull-ups,
except that this one works on the muscle between your ears.

<p>
Have a good day now.
