<p><font size="+2">German Court Orders A.A. Books Destroyed</font>
<p>There is good news, and there is bad news...&nbsp;
<p>On May 14, 1999 the German courts rejected the claims of AAeV (the German
AA GSO) regarding the free distribution of a reprint of the 1st 164 pages
of the AA book in English, Finnish, Swedish, Russian and Hebrew. Those
books will continue to be distributed at no charge around the world --
to those who cannot afford the approximately $45.00 (US funds) a couple
of these country's "official" GSO's are charging for their "authorized"
versions.&nbsp;
<p>The German GSO, with the approval and help of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Inc. (AAWS) in New York, wanted to fine the AA member and group
a half million German dollars (over $330,000 US). The German GSO was ordered
to pay all court costs in this case -- one of three which were pending.&nbsp;
<h3>
Books to be Destroyed</h3>
The second case was found in favor of the German GSO. It means that an
individual AA member (one of the only ones named in the case) must pay
all costs relating to the German translation of the AA book. He has to
stop distribution of the German translation, reveal all distribution and
production details (including the full names of AA members into public
court records). AND turn over all of the remaining German books over to
the german GSO in order for them to be DESTROYED!
<p>&nbsp;By following the directions of the German courts, the individual
fellow AA member will not only be rendered bankrupt, he will be forced
to break the anonymity of many fellow AA members.&nbsp;
<p>The other case is a criminal charge levied against the AA member that
has been postponed until November. If found guilty in that one, he will
be branded a criminal in a case brought by fellow AA members with the help
and consent of AAWS in New York.&nbsp;
<p>The AA member in question will appeal the decision on the 2nd case to
a higher court. However, this will also bring forth the criminal charges.&nbsp;
<h3>
Breaking Anonymity</h3>
The German GSO had revealed into public court records the full names and
addresses of more than 130 AA members. That means AA in Germany with the
consent and help from AAWS in New York, violated AA's Tradition on Anonymity
by allowing over 130 names of AA members to be placed in the public record.&nbsp;
<p>The reason that there was a need for a free German translation was that
there were already three different translations (1962, 1974 and 1983).
These translations were NOT accurate translations, often leaving out the
spiritual aspect of the AA program as well as interpreting the original
English text in a biased manner inconsistent with the intent of our founding
members.&nbsp;
<p>The German GSO, again with the approval, help and consent of AAWS was
also asking that the individual fellow AA member be forever banned from
owning, purchasing, or giving away ANY AA literature. This would have effectively
blocked him from carrying the message of recovery to the still sick and
suffering alcoholic, thus would have removed him from membership in AA
itself.&nbsp;
<h3>
I Plead Guilty</h3>
In solidarity with this individual AA member and the over 130 other members
named in the court papers and the hundreds of others whose names will publicly
be revealed as the result of this case, <b>I will plead guilty.&nbsp;</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>I plead guilty to carrying the message of recovery to the still sick
and suffering alcoholic.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I plead guilty to freely giving of what I have been freely given.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I plead guilty to not believing that newcomers should be forced to pay
about ten times more for an AA book that we pay in the US.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I plead guilty to believing in our Tradition of Anonymity and not placing
AA member's names in the public record.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I plead guilty to believing what it says in the AA Service Manual under
the Concepts that AA WILL NEVER BE PERSONALLY PUNITIVE towards AA members
and that what we have we must freely give away.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I plead guilty to believing that AA is supposed to be a spiritual entity,
based upon principles of honesty and not upon money, property and prestige.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I also plead guilty to distributing free books to the still sick and
suffering alcoholic and anyone else in AA who wishes to recover from a
seemingly hopeless state of mind and body.&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Property and Prestige</h3>
AA is no longer run from the bottom up (the membership), it is run by a
board of trustees bent upon maintaining an approximate $11,000,000 a year
business and feels threatened by the free distribution of books by stating
that this free distribution violates their so-called intellectual PROPERTY.
<p>&nbsp;AA is not now, nor has it ever been fully self-supporting through
its own contributions. It relies upon the sale of literature in order to
maintain high salaried employees, large comfortable offices, worldwide
travel (paid for by us) and other amenities. Most of these sales go to
outside enterprises and thus much of AA's income is derived from outside
sources.&nbsp;
<p><b>For all this I plead guilty and am saddened by the turn of events
in Germany. AA Inc. will litigate against anyone who threatens their property,
income and prestige or questions their ultimate perceived authority over
AA members. </b>They are not protecting us from the bad guys, they are
protecting themselves and their employees from the loss of MONEY.&nbsp;
<p><b>If anyone else wishes to plead guilty to carrying the message of
recovery, please contact your delegate, the board of trustees and other
AA members.</b> Their answer of course will be a terse one. It will state
that AA cannot survive without literature sales and they are protecting
intellectual property. Free books will continue to be distributed in many
languages, even in German if the court so decides upon appeal.&nbsp;
<p>If carrying the message of recovery is a crime, EVERY AA MEMBER IS A
CRIMINAL. If this is indeed the case, I am proud to proclaim it from the
rooftops, I am a grateful criminal, sober by the Grace of God and the Fellowship
of AA.&nbsp;
