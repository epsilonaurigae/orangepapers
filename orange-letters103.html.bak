Subject:  	AA is full of shit<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I just found your site last week by googling &quot;AA is full of shit&quot;.  I have been
sober for about 2 months now.  I got sober around New Years after years of hard
drinking.  I was drinking about a fifth of vodka or more a day towards the end which
was strange in that I had always been a whiskey and beer drinker.  I guess I was
drinking vodka to mask the smell while around my girlfriend and others.  Anyway,
after a few very bad fights with the girl and fucking up a few business deals I
decided to quit and go to rehab.
<p>
I didn't have insurance but was able to pay around
15k for my treatment.  I quickly found out that most centers cost much more than
that.  A center in Florida was willing to work with me but insisted that go thru
detox which cost about 7500 dollars &#8212; they agreed to discount the remaining days of
treatment for exactly the amount of money that I had.
<p>
I asked if I could just go
thru the 21 days of treatment without detox and give them the
negotiated rate because at this point I had been sober for a couple of weeks.
They would not do it and even suggested that I drink moderately until I get there
to avoid death which I did not do.
<p>
To make a long story short, once I arrived I
was put on lots of medication which made me higher than any drunk I have ever been
on.  I can't remember much from this period other than sleeping thru classes and
being told to surrender my will and all sorts of shit like that.  When I finally
emerged from the drug induced haze a couple of weeks later I was unable to sleep
and was extremely irratible so much so that I was thrown out for arguing with a
nurse over sleeping medication.  Put in a van and dumped at Palm Beach airport.
<p>
When I got home my girlfriend was furious and did believe my story.  I started
going to AA meetings in order to make her happy and to start my new sober life.  I
attended daily for over a month and it didn't seem to matter where I went
the same creeps were always there.
<p>
I have a hard time believing that all the
negative reinforcement and bullshit clich&eacute;s heal anyone.
<p>
<ul>
<li> I don't understand how
someone that has been a thorough fuckup for all their lives can suddenly become a
qualified life coach for anyone.
<p>
<li> I find it ironic that a program based on honesty
and humility has so many narcissists within its membership.

<p><li> It seems like everyone I meet there romanticizes their drinking while
minimizing your experience &#8212; &quot;that's nothing; you should have seen me....&quot;
</ul>
<p>
The only thing that I have found rewarding in
the program is that I can go there and talk to people about my drinking problem and
not burden my friends and family with it but it does come at a price.  I have this
creep trying to be my sponsor and he wants me to work a fourth and fifth step with
him.  He also wants me to call him a couple of times a day to check in.
<p>
I got to tell you &#8212; AA makes me want to drink.  I just don't get it.  I
haven't drank yet and hope that I don't and I don't.
<p>
The spirituality concept just doesn't make sense to me.  I don't go to church and
don't really get that either.
<p>
I've started watching Big Love on HBO.  I see a lot of similarities with AA there.
I work in politics and have done political messaging and commercials for several
years now and see a little of that in AA too.  I feel like I have stumbled across a
fabulous subject for a documentary.  What strange group of fucking people.  Lying,
miserable, ass working, etc... that's what I encountered at AA.
<p>
I also think there's direct violation of separation of church and state with the
court mandates and federal funding &#8212; do you?

<p>
Best,<br>
Mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story. The short answer is, &quot;Yes,
yes, and yes, all the way down the list.&quot;
<p>
The treatment center was way out of line. I really don't know why they
have not been sued out of existence by now.

<p>
Yes. That is the underlying fundamental fatal flaw in the whole 12-Step &quot;recovery-group&quot; model.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters85.html#fraught">A previous correspondent wrote</a>:
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;A flawed idea that AA is built upon:  The idea that a deeply flawed person
will cure another deeply flawed person.  A dynamic fraught with peril.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or, as I like to say, &quot;The inmates really are running the insane asylum.&quot;
<p>
The A.A. sponsors kill a lot of people through stupidity and insanity.
And ignorance and dogmatic beliefs.
And lust for power or sex. And egotism and vanity.
They are some of the worst counselors in the world.

<p>
<li>
<font color="black">
&quot;I find it ironic that a program based on honesty and humility has so many

<p>
Yes. Alcoholics Anonymous seems to distill and concentrate them. It's actually a
common occupational hazard for all recovery groups.
The healthier people recover and leave and get on with their lives.
The unhealthy ones don't recover &#8212; they
stay forever and become the old-timer mentors for the newcomers.
Eventually, the majority of the old-timers are really sick people.
(That is why Jack Trimpey shut down the Rational Recovery meetings.
<a href="orange-letters76.html#sick_groups">Look here</a>.)

<p><li>
<font color="black">
It seems like everyone I meet there romanticizes their drinking while
minimizing your experience &#8212; &quot;that's nothing; you should
have seen me....&quot;
</font>
<p>
Again, yes. That problem goes all of the way back to the Oxford Group roots of
Alcoholics Anonymous, where people would brag about their sins, and exaggerate
their &quot;wild and crazy ways&quot; before the O.G. recruiter saved them from
such fun.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#unwholesome" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
And actually, the problem goes all the way back to first-century Christianity.
The book of James advised people to confess their sins to one another, but the
early Christians soon found that such public church confessions created huge problems:
the sensibilities of old people were offended, while the children were corrupted
by the practice &#8212; they were informed of all kinds of new sins that they might like
to try &#8212; while the sinners doing the confessing were takings
 great pride in the outrageousness of their sins.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;My sins were much bigger and grander than your wimpy-ass little sins.&quot;<br>
</font>
The Church very quickly put a stop to the practice of public confessions, and now the Catholic Church
has a rule against public confessions. All confessions are done in private, only to
a priest who is sworn to secrecy.

<p>
What Dr. Frank Buchman did with the Oxford Groups was 
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#confessions1" target="_blank">revive a 2000-year-old mistake</a>.
And now A.A. is continuing the mistake.
<p>
And there is one other huge problem with minimizing people's experiences
and suffering, and I got my fingers burned by it.
When a hard-core old-timer says, &quot;Oh shucks! That's nothing! You
should have seen me!&quot;, it can lead to
the newcomer getting the impression that he isn't really an alcoholic
after all &#8212; certainly not an alcoholic like the old-timer.
Which means that it is okay to drink some more, because things aren't
really so bad. That's what happened to me. The story is
<a href="orange-letters63.html#orange_juice">here</a>.


<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;The spirituality concept just doesn't make sense to me.  I don't
go to church and don't really get that either.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Yes, it's bullshit.  Now mind you, I'm not an atheist or agnostic. I do
believe in spirituality. And I know that lying to sick people about a
suggested cure and how well it works isn't spiritual at all.
And they do that at the start of every meeting as they read the
plastic-laminated dogma from pages 58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
And trying to blackmail God and get miracles on demand isn't spiritual
either. The real A.A. program is:
<p>
<indent>
<!-- blockquote -->
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God: either You give me all of these things or else I'll drink myself to death:
<ul>
<li> In Step One, manage my unmanageable life for me, and make me quit drinking, or else...
<li> In Step Two, restore me to sanity, or else...
<li> In Step Three, take care of my will and my life for me, or else...
<li> In Step Five, listen to my confession, or else...
<li> In Step Seven, remove all of my moral shortcomings and defects of character, or else...
<li> In Step Eleven, talk to me and give me Guidance and work orders, and power, or else...
<li> In Step Twelve, give me a spiritual experience, or a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;, or else...&quot;
</ul>
</font>
<!--- /blockquote -->
</indent>

<p>
It's all &quot;gimme, gimme, gimme.&quot;
<p>
If God won't play along and tolerate the blackmail and deliver the goodies, then
the Twelve-Step program cannot possibly work.
<p>
A.A. is not a self-help group; it's an elf-help group. It isn't much different
from praying for a leprechaun to bring you a pot of gold.

<p>
A.A. is actually grossly heretical and unChristian, even anti-Christian.  If you are interested, I wrote
a whole file about that,
<a href="orange-heresy.html"><i>The Heresy of the 12 Steps</i></a>.


<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;I also think there's direct violation of separation of church and state with the
court mandates and federal funding &#8212; do you?&quot;
</font>
<p>
Of course. It is blatantly wrong and unConstitutional.  Unfortunately, the politicians do not
seem to care about Constitutional issues unless they threaten their political careers.

</ul>
<p>
You might want to check out the non-cult recovery groups to see if you can find some companionship or
kindred spirits there. I think all of these web sites have online forums, and you can ask about
local meetings. Plus, it may mollify your girlfriend if you are going to another kind of recovery group.

<p>
Mr. Orange,

<p>
I just want to say thanks.   Thanks for your writing, your investigation, your
energy and your commitment to your web site.  I'm not going to write a lot here
because so many of the letters you've received and published echo the lunacy I've
discovered in AA.  I will say this though: when I first attended an AA meeting I
immediately felt uncomfortable and dubious.  My instincts were telling me to get the
hell out of that room.  I didn't feel that way when I attended local adult school
classes on finance and real estate.  I didn't feel that way while attending my very
first Major League baseball game.  I didn't feel that way as a guest of a
neighborhood church.  Hell, I didn't feel as queasy facing my dentist with a root
canal.  People undecided on AA or looking for an alternative way should really trust
their guts.  If it appears scary and deceitful, then it most likely is.  If it
sounds too good to be true, then it is most likely false.

<p>
I understand from your site that you successfully quit smoking &#8212; terrific!  I too
recently gave it up and did so with the help of this website
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.whyquit.com/" target="_blank">
http://www.whyquit.com</a>.
Here is a person much like yourself who has devoted a lot of time and energy for the
betterment of &quot;his fellows&quot; while seeking nothing in return.  If you are already
aware of Joel Spitzer, I'd like to hear your take on his approach to smoking
cessation.  I honestly believe that if a similar drinking cessation plan of action
was put together, it would show very positive results.

<p>
Again, thank you and please do keep up your important work.

<p>
Regards,
Mario

Hi Mario,

Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And yes, I quit smoking too, eight years ago.
I was just describing the process for another fellow who is contemplating quitting.

<a name="qwest"> </a>
<font color="blue">
Blog note, 2008.03.28
<p>
Ah yes, Qwest.  On the morning of Monday, March 16, Qwest turned off my phone and Internet DSL line because of some complaint
about somebody downloading copyrighted material.  There had been a similar complaint a year earlier.
NBC-Universal complained that somebody was downloading episodes of <i>Heroes</i> and <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.
I explained to them that I didn't even know that you could do that, and had never done it, and
didn't watch <i>Heroes</i> re-runs, and had not ever even seen an episode of the remake of <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>.
The last time I watched <i>Battlestar Galactica</i> was when some network broadcast a second-rate pseudo-science-fiction
series that starred Lorne Green as the commander of a rag-tag band of spaceships that wandered the galaxy
searching for the planet Earth. That was about 25 years ago.

<p>
Of course I download stuff, lots of stuff, and also seed stuff using P2P protocols.
But my big interest is history, especially the history of fascism in the USA and
Britain in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties before World War Two. And I'm always
seeking those photographs of Frank Buchman with Nazis.

<p>
I know what happened. I left my wifi open, without an encryption key, so that poor neighbors who could not afford
their own DSL line or Comcast Cable or other Internet connection could piggy-back on me and get a little Internet access.
I don't know who they are, but I know that they exist, because the DHCP logs told me about them getting assigned IP numbers.
And apparently, somebody downloaded something that made NBC-Universal unhappy.
<p>
So, no good deed goes unpunished.
<p>
Now I'm shopping around for another Internet carrier. Answering email might be even more irregular until I
get a new connection. For now I'm taking a laptop to a friend's house to do updates of the web site.
<p>
And you might want to keep this in mind if you are considering using Qwest. I can't recommend them.
They also ripped me off for $200 for an &quot;Early Termination Fee&quot; when I cancelled an unused cell phone.
That's on top of me paying them $80 per month &#8212; 40 for the phone line and 40 for DSL, just to get Internet access.
They get that kind of money out of me, and they still turn me off.
Well, that's 80 per month that they won't be getting from me any more.
<p>
Of course your mileage may vary. Good luck.
<p>
Have a good day.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: Qwest also tried another $200 rip-off: They fabricated a charge of $200 for nothing and put it on the final
bill, and then immediately sent the bill to a collections agency. And they do that to all of the accounts that they
cancel. Wikipedia even reported that, until someone deleted that information.
<p>
LATER: Qwest got bought out or transformed into &quot;Centurylink&quot;.

Hello DB,
<p>
I am fine, thank you.
And thanks for the compliment.
</font>
<p>
I am in recovery myself and have been sober for 7 years (intermittently in out of
the madness of AA groups and ideology). What has drawn back into the rooms are the
people I have met therein.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your sobriety.  Seven years is like a special milestone.
(Did you know that most of your body is completely replaced and regenerated every seven years?)
</font>
<p>
I am no longer a part of AA, in fact I want nothing to do with it and it has
actually created one of the greatest tribulations in my recovery: I have fallen in
love with a woman whom I met in the rooms. It is a great misfortune indeed that
there are some truly good people entrapped in the AA web.
<p>
Unfortunately she is fully indoctrinated &#8212; and like most faithful AA sheep &#8212; is
unable/unwilling to see the truth (or even entertain the idea of an alternate
truth).

<p>
I have been around the rooms long enough to see many members marriages disintegrate
in favour of relationships between members.  She believes that I will again attend
AA and I cannot help but wonder what will happen when she realizes I am absolutely
done with it.

<p>
I know, Orange that you are no more qualified to give advice (especially strangers)
than anyone else but what I seek is not so much your advice- but your experience ?
in your experience do you think there is any chance this relationship can survive
with her in AA and me not?

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hi Dan,
<p>
You are right, I am not like Ann Landers or Dear Abby, and I am no more qualified to give out advice on
romances than anybody else, but I will venture an opinion.
<p>
The killer line that I read in your letter is this:
<font color="#4f007f">
[She] &quot;is unable/unwilling to see the truth (or even entertain the idea of an alternate truth).&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is the kiss of death.  If she is really unwilling to see the truth, or even consider another viewpoint,
then there is very little chance of a relationship working.  She will never be able to respect your
decision to not be part of the cult.  She won't even understand why you make that choice.
<p>
Years ago, I heard this advice for a man:
<p>
<blockquote>
1. First, figure out where you are going in life.<br>
2. Then ask whether that woman will go there with you.<br>
3. Never reverse the order of items 1 and 2.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
And obviously, if she does not wish to go there with you, then she isn't the right woman for you.
<p>
And you are right &#8212; Cupid is stupid. I often agree with the people who say that Cupid is a demon from the
depths of Hell.
<p>
Have a good day.

What about the people that have defeated alcoholism through the AA principles and
have gone on to lead successful lives without alcohol, is there no account for the
absolute recovery of these, of which I have met many and consider myself one.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Brad,
<p>
You are assuming a lot there.  Your first assumption is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;defeated alcoholism through the AA principles&quot;</font>.
There is no evidence that A.A. practices cause people to quit drinking. The evidence is that A.A. practices
make people worse off.   
A.A. increases the rate of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">rearrests</a>, and A.A. even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raises the death rate</a>, while failing
to sober up the alcoholics. 
<p>
Whether you consider your sobriety to be due to A.A. practices does not prove or even indicate that
A.A. practices actually work to make alcoholics quit drinking.
<p>
Now there is no way to get accurate numbers for how many people successfully
quit drinking while intensively doing A.A. practices, and then left A.A.
and went on to live happy sober lives. All of the evidence says that there
were not very many such happy stories.
<p>
Have a good day.

So, my question to you sir is this? What does this &quot;Cult&quot; hope to accomplish??? Most
of your rantings are blatantly wrong or outright lies. I could rip you from one end
of your synopsis to the other without much effort at all. You do a great diservice
to those in need of this program. I have watched many, many people over the years
come in a mental, physical and emotional wreck. These same people are now very
productive citizens and attend on a basis that is comfortable for there work,
family, social schecules. You sir are either badly informed or just flat out lying
when you say us &quot;AA&quot; people recruit, nothing could be further from the truth. When a
newcomer comes around I will give them my number and if they would like to call I
will oblige. Never, NEVER! do I ask a newcomer for his number, where he lives or
demand anything from them. Again, another diservice you are doing. Get your facts
straight, they are not! It is clearly obvious that you know very little about AA. No
one should pay any attention to your rhetoric...........

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Frank,
<p>
The only actual question in your letter is the first line:
<font color="black">&quot;What does this &quot;Cult&quot; hope to accomplish???&quot;</font>

<p>
That's a darned good question. For some, it's getting under-age girls, money, status, and power.
Like the &quot;Midtown Group&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
For some, it's all &quot;Cars, pussy, and money&quot;, like the Phoenix Arizona Young People's A.A.
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
Other people want a ticket to Heaven, or the feeling of having a special hotline to God.<br>
Other people want a social club.<br>
Other people want to believe that they are right.<br>
Other people actually want to quit drinking.<br>
<p>
Then you repeat the standard A.A. line about
<font color="black">&quot;You do a great diservice to those in need of this program.&quot;</font>
That really is such a tired old slogan. So many A.A. members parrot it:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters.html#disservice">You are doing a real dis-service...</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#great_disservice">I am afraid you
are doing a great injustice to society by maintaining your website.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice">Your &quot;online book&quot;
does a great disservice to those looking for an answer.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice2">My dog demonstrates more care
and responsibility than you do.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters46.html#disservice">...can keep people who
need real help from finding it...</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters48.html#irresponsible">...please try to be
more responsible in espousing your version of the truth, it could prove
deadly to someone.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters.html#disservice">I feel you are doing
AA a dis-service for those who CHOOSE to try it, like I did.</a>

</ul>
<p>
Where on Earth do they teach you to say that?  Is there some special
school that teaches the standard party lines?

<p>
Beyond that, your letter is just attacks and accusations backed up by no facts or evidence.
<p>
Since you think you know something about the A.A. success rate, please answer these simple questions:

<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the actual A.A. success rate?  Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A.,

<li> How many of them finally pick up a one-year coin?<br>

I think you were saying that the Tax payers are paying for A.A. or were you saying

paying for the A.A. program.

It's the second one.  The treatment center wasn't A.A., but the so-called counselors were all A.A. and N.A. true believers
who promoted Steppism all the way, and that was paid for with city, state, and Federal funds.

It seems to me that the drug centers are changing their ways due to funding is being
pulled, but they still have some A.A. type provisions in the programs. I just went
thru 3 months of a Alcohol Rehab center (In Oct, Dec and Jan 2009). and they pushed
A.A., but the counselors themselves did not go and they were also alcoholics and drug
addicts. I thought that was kind of strange.

I was reading your page about the snake oils. Well, you make some real good points
and some not so good ones. I'm sure you have received letters condemning you to
eternal hell for those heretic views. Not from me. I truly agree with you that
religion is used as a narcotic. Not just in the USA but all over in the world. In
small dozes it can be helpful. Like meds, but if you OD on it.....
<p>
But, there are people who looking for help. Help to stop  VOLUNTARY  addictions.
Like drugs, booze, porn, gambling. You were right about the 12 step does not fit for
everything. Loved the one on Hepatitis C.    What with those people. Where should
they go? I have an addicted in my life. I used to smoke for 20 years and stopped.
Got meds for it, but I looked for help. So, what is your opinion how can I help an
addict loved one?
<p>
Mercedes

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mercedes,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. You know, you are asking the toughest question of all.
<p>
The real short answer is that there is no panacea &#8212; no cure-all.
<p>
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-letters.html#millionaire">a letter that came seven or eight years ago</a>,
where a woman asked what might help her husband, and I had to explain that there was no guaranteed cure.
Then I went to a SMART meeting and said that I was feeling inadequate because I didn't have any magic bullet
to offer her.
<p>
The SMART facilitator said,
<font color="black">
&quot;She wants to buy something that will
make her husband quit drinking. If you could put a package like
that together, you'd be a millionaire. All of the wives would
buy it.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Alas, yes.
<p>
<a name="doctor"> </a>
Nevertheless, there are certainly some things that can help.
<p>
<ol>

<li>
First off, use the services of a good doctor &#8212; especially someone who really knows something about addictions.
About half of all of the people who have addiction problems really have underlying medical or psychiatric problems
that they are trying vainly to fix by self-medicating with drugs or alcohol.
People with bi-polar disorder (the old name is &quot;manic-depressive disorder&quot;) are notorious for immense
manic over-consumption of drugs and alcohol.

<p>
<li> Then consider why that person is using too much of something. What does that person really want?
Above all, does that person want to quit? A lot of things hinge on the answer. It is nearly impossible to
get someone to quit when they do not wish to quit.

<p>
<li> That's where something like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>
comes in. One of the four objectives of SMART is to increase motivation
to quit and stay quit.
<p>
One of the things that helps to increase motivation to quit
is to look realistically at the benefits and costs of getting high.
SMART calls that doing a &quot;risk-reward&quot; analysis. I prefer the
name &quot;cost-benefit analysis&quot;, which is what
accountants and businessmen use, but no matter. It's just a name.
<p>
I did a rap on cost-benefit analyses in an earlier letter,
<a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit">here</a>.
<p>
The SMART web site is <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">http://www.smartrecovery.org/</a>,
and they have meetings all over the country. You can find a list of
local meetings on their web site.
<p>
And of course I don't want to slight the other non-cult recovery groups:
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.womenforsobriety.org/">WFS</a> Women For Sobriety
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a> Secular Organizations for Sobriety
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.unhooked.com/index.htm">LSR</a> LifeRing Secular Recovery
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221449/http://www.rational.org/">RR</a> Rational Recovery
</ol>
<p>
The last one, Rational Recovery, is no longer &quot;a group&quot;, it's a book, and a technique &#8212; basically the same
idea as the <a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
<p>
Oh, and most of those web sites have forums where you can just talk to others and share experiences and problems.

<p>
<li>
And please do read about the old Base Brain or Lizard Brain
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
Recognizing his wheedling and complaining and begging and urging me to
<i>&quot;just have a little bit&quot;</i> helps me to avoid relapses.
It helps a lot.  I have found that knowledge to be a real life-saver.


<p><li>
And I put together a list of discussions of what works, earlier,
that you might want to look at,
and
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works" target="_blank">it is here</a>.
</ol>

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

If you have long time sobriety in AA you will have seen just about everything you
might have seen in a bar..... The behavior of old timer males is well documented and
often, if they are capable of being honest, will even be admitted to. You haven't
spoken about other kinds of predatory behavior, such as financial fraud,
misrepresentation of events, character assassination, shame fostering, child
molestation, physical abuse, arm chair psychiatry, malpractice,
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Gerald,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. About those other sins and crimes, I have not
spent a great deal of time on them, but people who send in letters have
spoken about them many times. And I have certainly talked about child
molestation &#8212; my &quot;counselor&quot; at the &quot;treatment center&quot;
went to prison for it.  <a href="orange-intro.html">Look here</a>.
And then there are the groups like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the Midtown Group</a>
that also specialize in supplying young girls to old sponsors.
</font>
<p>
It's the old adage
that many of us are wrong, and quite frequently so.  My own experience with AA and
medication is that the pressure not to take meds exceeded the individual  beliefs on
the subject... i.e. what ones says in a group as to what is said privately..... My
good friends in AA would have blissfully watched me die rather than encourage me to
seek help for depression and manic depressive condition.  I was able to seek other
sources, after a great deal of suffering.
<p>
I read a lot of Bill's writing on
depression and can honestly say, yes he experienced.  You scoff at the idea of
Wilson being sexually addicted, though his conduct could certainly point to that.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I honestly don't remember having ever &quot;denied&quot; that Wilson was sexually addicted.
I also doubt that I ever said he was. I don't think I said anything about
&quot;sexual addiction&quot; one way or the other.
<p>
That said, I wonder whether Wilson would qualify as &quot;sexually addicted&quot;.
Many of the stunts that he pulled, and much of his behavior, like wanting to be seen as a real lady's
man with a string of conquests, fits the pattern of Narcissistic Personality
Disorder.  Bill was often just showing off.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#two_women">He even took two women to an A.A. meeting</a>,
and seated them on either side of himself,
and kept his hands on their legs all through the meeting. 
Bill just wanted the other guys to feel envy.
That's NPD.
</font>
<p>
I
think he was most probably bi-polar, which I think because having been diagnosed in
1974; I went a long time without treatment, so I have some authenticity in
experiencing it in others. John Barryman, the poet, suffered at length from it... His
wife knew that one of it's symptoms in him was the sudden obsession with women
outside the relationship which usually amounted to little.  His last bout found him
obsessed with a student and convincing his friends this was the genuine article.
They enabled him to pursue this though when confronted by his wife latter, realized
that it was mania. This was the last event before his suicide.  An unfortunate
misunderstanding, but not an uncommon one for his condition.
<p>
<font color="blue">
But depression is also a common problem with Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
The narcissist is either on top of the world, or at the bottom of the garbage heap.
The slightest word of criticism is enough to send him crashing into the depths of depression.
<p>
Plus, Bill's time-line is funny:
<ul>
<li> Bill Wilson went into a year-long depression when his mother
left him with his grandparents, because Bill felt that he had been dumped.
<li>Then Bill went into a three-year-long period of depression when his high-school girlfriend Bertha Bamford died.
<li>Then Bill had an 11-year-long period of depression while he was allegedly sober, 1944 to 1955.
</ul>
Bi-polar people cycle between highs and low.  Bill wasn't cycling. Bill really looks a lot more like a case of NPD.
Whenever things didn't go Bill's way, he got depressed.
</font>
<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
The anger and resentment you have for B. Wilson seems genuine enough but
 aren't you throwing the baby out with the bath water. There are no gods
 in AA, just humans with all the shortcoming, frailties, egos, and propensity
 for bullshit.  AA is still the only game in town for addictions but it
 is capable of evolving and like it or not.... it does.
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is not the only game in town. In fact, it isn't in the game at all because it does not work.
It is a fraud and a hoax. 
</font>
<p>
The young aa's couldn't get a seat there for some time,  Drug addicts were
not welcome because some old timer didn't want to give up his or her valium....
<p>
<font color="blue">
So now A.A. will generously let more kinds of people in?
But how does that help them when A.A. doesn't work?
</font>
<p>
Like it or not it was founded by people with serious unsavory habits and beliefs. In
spite of itself, it continues to fulfill its goal.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, it does not &quot;fulfill its goal&quot;, not unless the goal is to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
</font>
<p>
I also no that Wilson spoke of
when AA passes from the scene as it will eventually.  It will not be because of
Wilson's infidelity, dr. bob's religious fervor, or any slight or shortcoming made
by its members but because it no longer meets a need.
<p>
Gerald T.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, I guess that time has come. And the reason that A.A. will pass away is because it does not work.

You, on the other hand, seem to have a problem with people who tell
the truth. You have my sympathy.
<p>
Maybe you will recover some day. Then again, maybe not.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
what's your problem with AA dude? i've been clean 7 years now and i was looking for
some literature about step 4 with google and i found your page.

<p>
what are you trying to accomplish by defaming AA? is it okay with you if people fix
their lives and become sober?

<p>

Hello Ryan,

My purpose is to tell the truth and let people know that A.A. is a
fraud that does not work to help alcoholics to get sober &#8212;

Subject:  	thanks for your site<br>

<p>
Dear Orange (or is it Mr Orange? Whatever),

<p>
Your site has been a revelation to me; all those misgivings and doubts about AA I
have had have for years have been set out clearly on your site.
<p>
My situation; classic alcoholic for many years, went to a rehab (in Australia)
reputed to be top notch. Of course it was pure 12 step stuff; I did the 90
meetings/90 days, attended AA regularly for about two years but never went beyond
step 3 (thank God). After realising that one local meeting was a hotbed of
paedophiles (the 'leader' is still in prison) but seeing that no-one would even
criticise the guy to his face I began to wonder.
<p>
Then I was told very clearly to not
speak about people who I knew that were 'dry-drunks' but leading full and happy
lives (like the then Prime Minister of Australia!). Finally, I went to a spiritual
meeting and talked about my own 'awakening', which was a full-on epiphany that
occurred soon after I became sober. When I told the meeting that my experience
 of God had nothing to do with Jesus, Bill Wilson or AA, I was told to
 sit down, shut up or leave the meeting &#8212; I left, never to return.
<p>
I stayed sober 10 years and 8 months, pretty happy, had the usual shit life offers
(mother died, wife left me etc.) but never drank. Then one day, the lizard brain
snuck past my guard and I started again. Now, after a 3 1/2 year bust, I am sober
again (all right, only a week, but I have found slipping back into sobriety as easy
as slipping back into booze).
<p>
I went to a meeting the other day and it was
laughable. I don't know if this is happening much in the USA but there was lots of
talk about 'big book thumpers', the DVDs of Joe McQ and a new way of doing the
steps, plus the usual &quot;I was in AA 9 years, thought I was doing the steps, but I was
really a dry-drunk, but NOW, now I am really doing the steps&quot;. I even shared, and
all the old jingle-jangle slogans just came out without even any thought on my
part.
<p>
Now, here is my dilemma; while drinking I developed a great relationship with a
woman who was, unfortunately an alcoholic. She never recognised it, and I wasn't
going to say anything (an alko's dream really, a woman who can keep up with you
drinking-wise and doesn't complain at all!). Then, late last year, in some sort of
boozy fog, she made absurd allegations about my relationship with my daughters. Of
course I had to say &quot;see ya later kid&quot; and dumped her there and then.
<p>
Well lo and behold, she turned to AA, is 3 months sober, is very nice to be around
and wants to start again. All well and good but she is now a committed 12-stepper!
I have been warning her about AA but she is not for changing. My worry is, how far
do I go? If I do nothing then she may well end up in the cult 'hive-mind', but if I
keep criticising she may either bust or choose AA over me.
<p>
I know this is not a lonely hearts column and I am not after an answer, just thought
I would let others know of the dilemmas we can face.
<p>
Keep up the good work,

<p>

Hello Chris,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Starting at the top, yes, that same nonsense about
 Joe McQ. DVDs and Big-Book Thumpers is happening here too.
It seems to be all over the world.
And that line about <i>&quot;I thought I was doing the Steps, but...&quot;</i>
is really a classic. That is the standard introduction to ego games of
spiritual one-upmanship.
What it really means is, &quot;I'm doing the Steps better than you.&quot;
<p>
About the relationship with the woman: You are right. I'm not any expert advice for the lovelorn columnist.
I will venture an opinion anyway, and it is this:
<p>
<b>Unto thine own self be true.</b>
<p>
By that I mean, you will not be doing either her or yourself any favors by not telling her the truth.
If you don't tell her the truth, if you bite your tongue and hold back, then that limits the chances of
her waking up and seeing what is going on. And if she does end up being absorbed into the hive mind, and you
didn't really tell her the whole truth as often as you could, then you will feel guilty about it later.
<p>
On the other hand, if she is going to get mad and dump you because you
tell her the truth when she doesn't want to hear it, then that is probably
for the best &#8212; at least for you.

<p>
Now that doesn't mean that you have to just keep cramming your opinions
down her throat non-stop and drive her nuts. That is where some judgement comes in. 
You can play it by ear and estimate how insistent you should be. And
remember that sometimes you can win an argument by not winning it &#8212;
that is, you don't have to hammer the last point all of the way in. Sometimes
you can leave some space for her to connect the mental dots herself.

<p>
I would also be a little wary. You don't know that she isn't going to
relapse and go back to drinking and making accusations about your daughters
again.  Since A.A. doesn't work, and has a sky-high failure rate,
there is always that chance.

<p>
I can't predict the future, and neither can you. Some people actually
do snap out of it, and sometimes the snapping happens very quickly.
A dedicated cult member can become a dropout two weeks later.
Sometimes people can drastically change their opinion of things in just
a few hours or days, if they get the right stimulus and suddenly see
the light.
And other people just don't wake up, maybe not for years, or
maybe never.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Aldis J.&quot;<br>
Subject:  Deception<br>

<p>
I know that on your site you have pointed out that praying to tables or
doorknobs or chairs is heretical, but could it also be a deceptive,
surreptitious way of getting mixed up, ungrounded newcomers to practice
a form of mindfulness meditation?  I am referring to psychological
mindfulness, not the concept from Buddhism.  It does them some good,
makes them more able to focus on the present &amp; avoid temptation, and
they consequently come away thinking they &quot;found God in the program&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Aldis,
<p>
I think yes, it is a surreptitious way to get people mixed up.
For someone to pray to a bedpan, he has to suspend his disbelief.
That opens the door to all kinds of mind games.
And 
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_no_disbelief">Suspension Of Disbelief</a>
is actually one of the standard cult characteristics.
<p>
I think the strategy is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you can get them to believe that there is actually some sane reason for 
praying to bedpans and doorknobs, then you can get them to believe anything.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Have a good day.
