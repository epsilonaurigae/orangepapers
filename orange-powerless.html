<p>
<br>
The A.A. First Step, where people are supposed to &quot;admit&quot;
that they are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, is a hoax.
<p>
People are not &quot;powerless&quot; over their desires to
drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or take drugs.
Being sick, and having a messed-up life from too much drinking, is just that &#8212;
being sick. It isn't &quot;powerlessness.&quot;
Having difficulties quitting is not &quot;powerlessness&quot;, it's
having difficulties quitting. Saying that your drinking has really
gotten out of control doesn't mean that you are powerless over it.

<p>
Quitting can be hard, extremely difficult and painful, but that doesn't mean
that it's impossible, or that you can't do it. Remember: When the
going gets tough, the tough get going.

<p>
The &quot;powerless&quot; doctrine of Alcoholics Anonymous is one
of their most central religious beliefs. It is one of those points
where A.A. radically departs from Christianity or any other mainstream
religion of the world, and enters the bizarre realm of cult religion.
A.A. teaches that people are incapable of
running their own lives and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">must surrender control
of their lives to the A.A. group and a &quot;Higher Power&quot;</a>
who will control them, and do the quitting for them.
Thus the real purpose of Step One is to prepare the new members for
Steps Two and Three, where they will confess that they are insane,
and then surrender their wills and their lives to &quot;the care of God&quot; and
the Alcoholics Anonymous group.

<p>
<a name="ftnt04_ret"> </a>
One of the biggest problems with the Twelve-Step program is the
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">learned helplessness caused by the
First Step</a>, where people are taught to confess that they are
&quot;powerless over alcohol.&quot;
This leads many people to believe that once they have a drink, that
a full-blown relapse and total loss of self-control is inevitable
and unavoidable.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>

<p>
The other half of Step One, which says that &quot;our lives had
become unmanageable&quot;, leads some people to believe that they
shouldn't even try to manage their lives.
Step Two is just as bad: it teaches people
that they are insane, and that only a Supernatural Being
can restore them to sanity &#8212; which means that they are helpless,
and cannot heal themselves.
Then Step Three teaches a lifestyle of
passive dependency, where A.A. members turn control of their wills
and their lives over to &quot;the care of God <i>as we understood
Him</i>&quot;, and they expect God to run their lives and solve all their
problems for them from then on...

<p>
The doctrine that alcoholics are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; came from the Oxford Group,
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman's cult religion. Dr. Buchman declared that people
were &quot;defeated by sin&quot;, and powerless over it, and unable to refrain from sinning,
and only by surrendering to his cult religion could people escape from a life of sin.
William Griffith Wilson, Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith, and Clarence Snyder were all members of
this cult. They adapted Buchman's cult religion to a &quot;program for alcoholism&quot;, and
simply copied the entire cult religion and renamed it to &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.
Bill Wilson just changed the word &quot;sin&quot; to &quot;alcohol&quot;, and
declared that alcoholics were &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, and only by
surrender to his cult religion could alcoholics escape from a lifetime of excessive
drinking.

<a name="Silkworths_theory"> </a>

Bill Wilson routinely tried to cite the &quot;powerless&quot; idea and the disease theory of
alcoholism to explain away his previous poor behavior.
The official A.A. history book, &quot;PASS IT ON&quot;, tells how Bill Wilson happily discovered
that the disease theory of alcoholism relieved him of his feelings of guilt &#8212; it wasn't
really his fault after all, because he was powerless over alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Bill listened, entranced, as Silkworth explained his theory. For the first
time in his life, Bill was hearing about alcoholism not as a lack of willpower,
not as a moral defect, but as a legitimate illness. It was Dr. Silkworth's theory
&#8212; unique at the time &#8212; that alcoholism was the combination of this mysterious
pysical &quot;allergy&quot; and the compulsion to drink; that alcoholism could no more
be &quot;defeated&quot; by willpower than could tuberculosis. Bill's relief was immense.<br>

<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
By the way, that story is apocryphal, just another one of Bill's gross exaggerations
and historical fabrications.  The idea that alcoholism was a disease was already
commonplace and popular, and had been for more than a century.
Dr. Benjamin Rush advanced the idea of alcoholism as a disease in 1784 in
his
<i>Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits on the Human Mind and Body</i>.
There was a counterpart in Britain: the Edinburgh physician Thomas
Trotter wrote in his doctoral dissertation, <i>An essay, medical,
philosophical and chemical on drunkenness</i>, submitted in 1788 and
published version in 1804, that &quot;In medical language, I consider
drunkennes to be a disease...&quot; He also wrote that &quot;the habit of
drunkennes is a disease of the mind&quot;.

<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Salvation_Army" target="_blank">The Salvation Army had been teaching</a>
that alcoholism was a disease since 1890.
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Beverly_Nichols" target="_blank">The Oxford Group taught the same thing</a>
in the nineteen-twenties and -thirties, and
Bill Wilson was a member of the Oxford Group cult religion.
<p>
Beverly Nichols, who was a member of the Oxford Group for a while, and then
criticized it, described how the proper Oxford Group wife who is &quot;Absolutely Unselfish&quot;
must tolerate the behavior of an alcoholic husband:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>Absolute Unselfishness</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
...an absolutely unselfish wife must endure, year in and year out, the
persecution of a drunkard. She must never assert herself, never speak harshly to him,
never protest when he revolts her sensibilities, terrifies her children, turns her
house into a lunatic asylum, gambles away her money.
'It is not <i>him</i>,' she must say. 'It is a disease.'<br>

So, in the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will is amazingly
weakened when it comes to combating liquor, though it often remains strong
in other respects. My incredible behavior in the face of a desperate
desire to stop was explained. Understanding myself now, I fared forth

town regularly and even made a little money. Surely this was the answer

that he still sometimes displays with respect to other matters?<br>

that two very different things are the same thing.
The fact that someone is behaving in an unwise manner &#8212; even in a suicidally stupid
manner &#8212; does not prove that he is &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
Nor does it prove that he is &quot;powerless&quot; over his desire to drink alcohol and get high.
Nor does it prove that he has a &quot;disease&quot;.
It just means that he is being stupid and making poor choices, like choosing short-term
pleasure over long-term health.

<font color="#9F0000"><i>
By the way, what Bill Wilson called &quot;self-knowledge&quot; was not self-knowledge.
Bill Wilson was just using more buzz-words and high-falitin' language.

His jabber about &quot;self-knowledge&quot; is just more meaningless slogan-slinging.

<p>
Other stories in the <i>Big Book</i> declare:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It helped me a lot to become convinced that alcoholism was a disease, not
a moral issue; that I had been drinking as a result of a compulsion,

<p>
<font color="blue">
On the contrary, sobriety is most assuredly a matter of will power and self-control.<br>

I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before some trivial reason
for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and more, for what I had
learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I knew from that moment
that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will power and self-knowledge
would not help in those strange mental blank spots. I had never been
able to understand people who said that a problem had them hopelessly

<p>
Those &quot;friends&quot; (actually, Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith)
&quot;prophesied&quot; that alcoholics
would suffer from &quot;strange mental blank spots&quot;, where
the alcoholism would seize control of their minds
and &quot;will power and self-knowledge would not help,&quot;
and they would be drunk before they even realized what was happening.
That is a great excuse for relapsing whenever someone craves a drink,
but it is totally untrue. It is ridiculous pseudo-science.
<p>
<center>
<font color="blue">
<b>THERE IS NO BLANK SPOT, NONE AT ALL.</b>
</font>

<p>

People may
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#monster_we" target="_blank">rationalize their
actions</a>,
or minimize the danger for a few minutes, or
make up all kinds of stupid excuses for
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#little_voice" target="_blank">why it's okay
to take that first drink, why it's okay to have <i>just one</i></a> (or two, or three...);
they may sometimes
even just refuse to think about the negative consequences of drinking
because
they really, <i>really</i> want that drink, but there is no
<font color="#af0000"><i>blank spot</i></font>
where
the alcoholic is unable to see that he is deliberately lifting
a drink to his mouth, choosing to drink, and that he is voluntarily
swallowing it.
There is no blank spot where he doesn't have a choice, and can't
control his hands or his mouth.

<p>
But Bill Wilson insisted that there was, and that he just couldn't
help but take a drink whenever he got some cravings. Bill was nuts.

<a name="ftnt03_ret"> </a>

Bill Wilson declared that he was &quot;powerless&quot; over just about every urge
or craving that he ever had, no matter whether it was a thirst for alcohol,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">cravings for cigarettes</a>,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">greed for money</a>,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">the desire for self-aggrandizement</a>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#few_weeks" target="_blank">the temptation to lie</a>,
or the urge to
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">cheat on his wife Lois</a>
by having sex with all of the pretty young women who came to the
A.A. meetings seeking help.
That's an interesting excuse for cheating on your wife,
one of the more novel ones, but it doesn't
wash.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>

<p>
Bill Wilson was habitually unfaithful to the wife who was working
to support him, both before and after sobriety.
He invented the A.A. tradition of <i>&quot;thirteenth stepping&quot;</i>
the attractive young women who came to A.A. looking for help.
Bill was such an outrageous philanderer that the other elder A.A. members
had to form a
&quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Founders_Watch" target="_blank">Founder's Watch Committee</a>&quot;,
whose job it was to follow Bill Wilson around, and watch him, and
break up budding sexual relationships with the pretty young things
before he publicly embarrassed A.A. yet
again.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>
When other early A.A. members, like Tom Powers, who helped Bill to write his second
book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, told Bill Wilson to quit the
philandering,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP" target="_blank">Bill whined that he couldn't give it up</a>.

<p>
So just how was Bill's behavior an example of a life
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#only_spiritual_experience" target="_blank">lived
on a spiritual basis</a>&quot;</i>?
Besides the fact that he
held s&eacute;ances and <a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">played with Ouija boards</a>,
and constantly hypocritically yammered words like &quot;God&quot;,
&quot;working selflessly&quot;,
and &quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">absolute purity</a>&quot;,
just what was &quot;spiritual&quot; about William G. Wilson?

In addition, Bill was just echoing the religious doctrine of
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman, who preached that everyone in the world
had been
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane" target="_blank">defeated by sin</a>,
and was powerless over it, and could only be saved by surrendering
his will and life to God and coming under &quot;God-control&quot;
(which really meant, coming under &quot;Frank-control&quot;).
<p>

Bill Wilson just
substituted the word &quot;alcohol&quot; for the word &quot;sin&quot;.
Bill wanted all of the alcoholics to feel
<a href="orange-recruit.html#hopeless" target="_blank">hopeless</a> and powerless
over alcohol so that they would despair and surrender to
&quot;the care of God as we understood Him&quot;,
which really meant,

hopelessness in a prospective recruit:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Bill continued:
<p>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li> Self-confidence is a total liability?
<li> No amount of human willpower can break the grip of alcoholism
on a person?
<li> There is no such thing as the personal conquest of this
compulsion by the unaided will?
</ul>
<p>
That is ridiculous and pathetic. Everyone who successfully quits drinking
uses his or her own will power. Everyone who stays quit uses his or
her own will power every day and every night.

<b>The Harvard Mental Health Letter</b>, from The Harvard Medical School,
stated quite plainly:

<b>On their own</b>
</font>
<br>
There is a high rate of recovery among alcoholics and addicts,
treated and untreated. According to one estimate, heroin addicts
break the habit in an average of 11 years.
Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was
interviewed, 57% said they simply decided that alcohol was bad
for them. Twenty-nine percent said health problems,
frightening experiences,
accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.
Others used such phrases as &quot;Things were building up&quot;
or &quot;I was sick and tired of it.&quot; Support from a husband
or wife was important in sustaining the resolution.<br>

Why shouldn't I be able to handle this crisis? After all, I had willpower.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Some time later Dr. Anderson was to make me think
about the latter. &quot;If alcoholism is a disease,&quot; he observed,
&quot;and I believe it is, what does willpower have to do with it?
A cardiac victim can't say, 'I will not have another heart attack,'
and will it so; the cancer patient can't say, 'I have willpower
and I will rid myself of it, I won't let it get
worse.' There is something about alcoholism that is organic
&#8212; physical and psychological in the the mind &#8212; and willpower
doesn't matter. When the alcoholic, after much suffering,
vows he'll never take another drink, he really means it at
the time. When he winds up drunk a month later, he wonders
what happened; he doesn't realize that willpower has
nothing to do with it.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is a twisty game of logic, isn't it? And very bad logic too.
Regardless of whether alcoholism is a &quot;disease&quot;, alcoholism is mainly
determined by whether you use your hand to lift an alcoholic beverage to your
mouth and drink it.  So of course you have control over it.  Drinking beer is not
like having a heart attack.
</font>
<p>

<font color="#9F0000">
Notice how the alleged 'doctor' said,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;If alcoholism is a disease...&quot;</i></font><br>
But since alcoholism <i>is not a disease</i> like having a heart attack,
will power has everything to do with quitting and staying quit.<br>
</font>
<font color="green">
(That is a good example of the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>Sly Suggestions</i></a>.
First, the 'doctor' <i>suggested</i> that alcoholism <i>might be</i> a disease &#8212;
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;If alcoholism is a disease...&quot;</i></font>
&#8212; and then he started dispensing critical life-or-death
medical advice based on the unquestioned belief that alcoholism really
was a disease over which the patient had no control.)
</font>

<p>
<!-- font color="blue" -->
Obviously, alcoholism is <i>not</i> a disease like cancer or cardiac
disease. Alcoholism is not a disease at all. It is habitual, compulsive
behavior.<br>
<li>
They don't build bars and pubs to dispense heart attacks, but they do for
alcoholism.
<li>
You cannot just stop having cancer merely by changing your diet, and perhaps abstaining
from eating something like white sugar or fats,
but you can stop suffering from alcoholism
just by abstaining from drinking ethyl alcohol.
That is not a disease; that is behavior.
<p>
(And I'm sure that some astute readers will immediately notice that occasionally,
you <i>can</i> prevent heart attacks &#8212; by changing your diet, quitting
smoking, getting more exercise, and living a healthier life-style &#8212;
so you aren't 100% powerless over heart attacks, either.)

<p>
When alcoholics wake up sick and hung over the morning after, and ask,
&quot;What happened?&quot;, the answer is simple. They took a drink
and rationalized that it would be okay. That first drink tasted <i>so okay</i> that they
then had a second one, and that was okay too, and so was a third one, etc...
After 4 or 5 drinks, they stopped counting...
When they wake up the next morning, feeling sick,
they find that they drank far more than they had originally intended.
But that's just how compulsive drinking and getting drunk works.
That isn't &quot;powerlessness&quot;.
<p>
People relapse because they think that they can just nibble a little
and get away with it. They imagine that they can do just a few without
getting hooked again. They are wrong. See
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank"><i>The Lizard-Brain
Addiction Monster</i></a> for more on that.

<p>
Now there is a genetic factor that changes how alcoholics feel,
and how they react to alcohol, but
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">those genes</a> do not force people to
drink to excess, and those genes do not make people powerless over alcohol.
Those genes just make managing alcohol much more difficult.
</font>

<p>
While the A.A. preachers are busy making you feel guilty about
everything, they
will tell you that you were extremely selfish because you chose
the bottle over family, friends, career, or anything else.
If that is true, then you had the power to choose, which means
that you weren't powerless over alcohol at all, which means that
the First Step is wrong.
<p>
For that matter, the whole blame game
is <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#stigma" target="_blank">a bait-and-switch stunt</a>.
They will start off by telling you
that it isn't your fault, alcoholism is not a moral stigma because
it's a disease and you are powerless over it.

<p>
What is this double-talk? That is contradictory.
In the first sentence, you are supposedly powerless over everything. In the second sentence
you are guilty of being dishonest and <i>in denial</i>, which means that you are in control of your behavior,

<a name="self_sufficiency_myth"> </a>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<p>
A.A. evangelists and talking heads like Jillian Sandell
(U. of California at Berkeley) actually
teach that personal control and personal accomplishment are
myths.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

She says that the Abraham Lincoln &quot;log cabin to the
White House&quot; story
is just another &quot;popular American myth&quot; and that such myths
&quot;allow individuals to believe that certain goals can be realized
through hard work, merit, or just being a nice person...&quot;
Ms. Sandell says that such beliefs are all wrong, and that change is only
possible by &quot;turning our lives over to god as we understand
him/her&quot;, and by working the Twelve Steps, of course:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A central premise of Twelve step programs (and the first 'Step') is
to acknowledge the futility of the illusion of individual control.
This is a key difference from self-help books and therapy, both of
which rest upon the belief in individual power to change situations.
Indeed, it is worth just briefly elaborating here some of the premises
upon which individual therapeutic practices are based since Twelve Step
programs are so different. Self-help books and individual therapy both
aim to give the individual a feeling of personal control. They tap
into the popular American myth that if we just try hard enough we
can be or do anything. This myth has taken on many forms, Cinderella's
'rags to riches' version is one, Abraham Lincoln's 'log cabin to White House'
is another, and Marty McFly's 'if you put your mind to it you can
achieve anything' (in Spielberg's <i>Back to the Future</i>) is another;
but all have the same aim. They allow individuals to believe that
certain goals can be realized though hard work, merit or just being
a nice person, thereby ignoring the larger societal structures.
Issues around class, race, sex, etc. become irrelevant and transcendable.
Both self-help books and therapy place all the responsibility of
change in the hands of individuals.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is not that Twelve Steppers think change is impossible, only that
it can not be achieved alone. Steps Two and Three go on to say that
we need to believe that a 'higher power' can restore us to health
and that we need to commit to turning our lives over to god as we
understand him/her. This last point is crucial since for many in the
program 'god' is simply 'the program' itself.<br>

<p>
That is passive dependency as a lifestyle and a religion.<br>
It's a total cop-out. It's refusing to really live.<br>

It's a cowardly retreat from life that tries to cover its
tracks by proclaiming that admitting powerlessness
and dependency is really wonderful &quot;rigorous honesty.&quot;<br>

It is
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank"><b>surrender to the cult</b></a>,
&quot;turning our lives over to god as we understand him/her.&quot;
<p>
Note that Jillian Sandell's lower-case &quot;god&quot; isn't

<b>&quot;for many in the program 'god' is simply 'the program' itself.&quot;</b><br>

<a name="loserism"> </a>

If I had to give a name to such a philosophy, I would call it
&quot;Loser-ism&quot;.
It's the church where you proudly brag about what a helpless loser you are.
The Beatles' song <i>I'm a Loser</i> is the standard church music.
Competence, strength, intelligence, self-reliance, and self-confidence
are terrible vices and sins,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#freedom2think" target="_blank">immoral mistakes to be avoided
at all costs</a>,
while incompetence, stupidity, ignorance, irrationalty,
superstition, blind faith, dependency, weakness, powerlessness, and insanity
are virtues to be proudly &quot;admitted&quot; at church get-togethers.<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are powerless over everything,&quot;<br>
&quot;You can't do it without your support group,&quot;<br>
</font>
and<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You can't handle life without having keepers to tell you what
to do&quot;,<br>
</font>
are the sacred teachings of the church.
<p><br>

Jillian Sandell's description of the A.A. version of recovery is inaccurate,
and a downright
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#reversal" target="_blank">reversal of reality</a> in many of her statements:
<p>
<ul>
<li> It is Alcoholics Anonymous that ignores
all &quot;larger societal structures&quot; like class, race, sex, environment,
poverty, child abuse, and family life.
A.A. says that those things are irrelevant.
A.A. says that you drank too much because you have nasty personal defects (&quot;defects of character&quot;):
you are sinful, willful, and selfish, you have numerous moral shortcomings,
and you have a huge ego that thinks it is the center of the Universe
and too big and too good to need God.
And A.A.'s answer is to give you the one-size-fits-all Twelve Step cure.
It doesn't matter what your personal history is, or what your race,
creed, sex, religion, socio-economic status, or anything else is;
it doesn't matter whether you were an abused child, or whether you
have physical or mental illnesses,
you will get prescribed the same &quot;simple&quot; 12-Step fix as
everybody else.
That is <i>really</i> ignoring all of the &quot;larger societal
structures.&quot;
<p>
<li>
And Step Two most assuredly <b>does not</b>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;say that we need to believe that a 'higher power' can restore
us to health&quot;</font>,
like Ms. Sandell says.<br>
Step Two says that we
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b>&quot;
</font>
<i><b>Sanity</b></i>, not <i>health</i>.
We must confess that we are insane and incapable of thinking for
ourselves (and thus incapable of managing our own lives).
<p>
<li>
Likewise, Step Three says that we must turn <b>our will</b> and our
lives over to the care of God or Alcoholics Anonymous, <i>not</i>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;that we need to commit to turning our lives over to god as
we understand him/her.&quot;
</font>
We must
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">surrender our will
to &quot;god&quot;</a>, or our &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;,
and let A.A. do our thinking for us, and let our sponsors boss us
around and tell us what to do with our lives.
<p>
Ms. Sandell blithely glosses over all of those gory little details.
(Perhaps she wishes to
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#arouse_prejudice" target="_blank">&quot;avoid
arousing any prejudices&quot; that we may have</a> against cult religions...)

<p>
<li>
Abraham Lincoln's life story is hardly a myth. Ms. Sandell would do well
to actually read a good biography of Abraham Lincoln.
He really did accomplish
many things through his own efforts, perseverence, and hard work,
like teaching himself to read and write, and becoming a lawyer just
by studying three law books and then passing the bar examination
(which, admittedly, must have been less complex in those days...)
Lincoln ran for Congress and the Senate, and sometimes won and sometimes
lost, but he persevered, and ended up becoming the President.
That is real United States of America history, not a popular myth.
And it is also a very inspiring story.
<p>
<li>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
And Ms. Sandell actually tells us that Marty McFly's <i>'if you put your
mind to it you can achieve anything'</i> attitude is all wrong? Just out
of wild curiosity, how did the Australian woman Jillian Sandell
graduate from college and become a Berkeley university
professor?<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>

By eschewing self-reliance and hard work?
By having her support group take her exams for her? I don't think so...
Does Ms. Sandell recommend the Church of Loserism for us recovering
alcoholics, while reserving the Right to Excel for herself?

<p>
<li>
All of the world's great religions teach just the opposite of the
A.A. doctrine of powerlessness.
And I do mean ALL of them: Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism,
Hinduism, Original American religious teachings, Confucianism, Taoism,
Bahai-ism, the <i>I Ching</i>, you name it.
They teach that personal morality consists of controlling one's own
actions, and actively doing good, and refraining from doing wrong.
They teach self-discipline, self-control, individual responsibility,
and personal accomplishment through perseverance and hard work.

Nobody is powerless over urges, cravings, or temptations. Just
because you feel an urge or a craving doesn't mean that you have to
give in to it, and feed it.
The way to quit drinking is not to expect God to just
<a href="#it_disappears">magically remove all desire for drink</a>.
The way to quit is to just not give in to the cravings that will
inevitably come. And that is just how the vast majority of people
quit.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific" target="_blank">Eighty
percent of all of the alcoholics who successfully
quit drinking do it alone</a>, without A.A., the Twelve Steps, or &quot;admitting&quot;
that they are powerless over alcohol.
<p>

You really can handle cravings and feelings of ecstatic recall.<br>

You are not powerless over your feelings.<br>

You are not the slave of your feelings.<br>

You do not have to relapse just
because you get some cravings or feelings of ecstatic recall.<br>

Feelings are just feelings, after all.
<p>

You don't really need a sponsor to hold your hand every night
for the rest of your life to keep you from drinking, smoking, or
drugging, which is good, because you really aren't going to get such a free
full-time baby-sitter, anyway. So you're still on your own.
<p>
In fact, if you are really going to quit, then you really have to quit.
That is, <i>you</i> really have to do the quitting yourself, and you have
to stay quit, by yourself.
Nobody else is going to do the quitting for you, not God, not
Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, not Santa Claus, not the Tooth Fairy,
and not your &quot;support group.&quot;

Also see <a href="orange-pseudo2.html#interventions" target="_blank">Jeff Jay's
declarations</a> that alcoholics <b><i>choose</i></b> addiction
over recovery, in his Hazelden book on interventions.
Throughout his book, he repeats the standard A.A. party line about
alcoholism being a disease, and the alcoholic not having any control
over it, and then he faults the alcoholics who will not
&quot;voluntarily choose&quot; to get sent to an expensive
residential treatment center like Hazelden ($30,000 for 28 days).
Someone who can voluntarily choose or refuse treatment is not
powerless. He has control over the situation.

<p><br>
And don't miss the Al-Anon declarations that even wives and children
of alcoholics should surrender their minds and
<a href="orange-heresy.html#free_fell" target="_blank">live lives that are
&quot;truly powerless&quot;</a>.

<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>, by
Francis Hartigan<br>
This biography was written by Lois Wilson's private secretary,
Francis Hartigan. If anybody should be privy to the insider secrets
about Bill's infidelities, it would be Francis.
And he says that Bill was about as faithful as a horny alley cat,
all of his life, both before and after sobriety.<br>
Bill Wilson was habitually unfaithful to the wife who was working
in a department store to support him.
Bill invented the A.A. tradition of <i>&quot;thirteenth stepping&quot;</i>
the attractive young women who came to A.A. looking for help.
Bill was such an outrageous philanderer that the other elder A.A. members
had to form a
&quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Founders_Watch" target="_blank">Founder's Watch Committee</a>&quot;,
whose job it was to follow Bill Wilson around, and watch him at A.A. meetings
and conventions, and
break up budding sexual relationships with the pretty young things
before he publicly embarrassed A.A. yet again.<br>
When other early A.A. members, like Tom Powers, who helped Bill to write his second
book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, told Bill to quit the womanizing,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP" target="_blank">Bill whined that he couldn't give it up</a>.<br>
See chapter 25, <i>The Other Woman</i>, page 192, for the description of the

LCCN: 2002100375<br>
A book of daily meditations.
Some of the worst mind-bending drivel around. On average, even worse than
Alcoholics Anonymous propaganda.
This is the religion that is dedicated to the insane proposition that you should
spend the rest of your life grovelling and wallowing in guilt and powerlessness
and confessing your sins because Daddy drank too much alcohol.<br>
