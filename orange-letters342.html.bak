<h2>Gifting table testimony cites severed rabbit head, questions about
link to slain Madison woman</h2>

<p>
Thursday, February 7, 2013

<p>
By Susan Misur<br>
smisur@nhregister.com / Twitter:@nhrsusan<br>
&lt;http://www.twitter.com/nhrsusan&gt;

<p>
HARTFORD &#8212; A Women's Gifting Table member testified Wednesday that she
found a severed rabbit head on her lawn while tables were under
investigation, and believes it was left by someone associated with a
murdered participant.

<p>
The witness said she told police she felt someone linked to Barbara
Hamburg, a table member found dead in 2010 in her yard in Madison, was
trying to send a message by leaving the animal head, adding that she
spotted the person's car in her neighborhood. However, police noted that
the incident, which occurred a few years ago, could have been the result
of a hungry coyote or other wild animal, she acknowledged.

<p>
The woman also told jurors in a trial focusing on the gifting tables
that she and fellow members of Alcoholics Anonymous were recruited to
the alleged pyramid scheme, at times by their AA sponsors. The woman
will only be named as Julie due to AA's firm belief in member privacy.

<p>
Julie took the stand in U.S. District Court in Hartford, where Guilford
residents Jill Platt and Donna Bello are on trial for serving as alleged
leaders of the gifting tables and have been charged with defrauding the
Internal Revenue Service and table members. Elena Cahill, a licensed
attorney who participated in a table, also testified, denying claims by
other witnesses that she said tables were legal.

<p>
Participants paid what they were told was a tax-free $5,000 gift to a
high-ranking group member to join a table, recruited friends, attended
meetings, and could climb the ranks to receive $40,000.

<p>
Julie said her AA sponsor-turned-best-friend introduced her to tables in
2009. Platt and Hamburg discussed table strategies with Julie, who soon
joined by paying her $5,000 entry fee to the friend who told her about
the group.

<p>
Julie said she believed that when you give a gift to someone, it comes
back to you and that she appreciated the group's oft-spoken goal of
helping women.

<p>
Along the way, Julie questioned aspects of the table, including how it
was legal, she said. Eventually, there were eight AA members involved in
tables and Julie attempted to recruit more. What followed was &quot;the
largest conflict I've ever seen in Alcoholics Anonymous,&quot; she said.
&quot;It's a violation of a trusted relationship. I trusted people to save my
life, and people trusted me to save their lives, and to take advantage
of that situation was a problem.&quot;

<p>
She quit her table in early 2010, a few months after then-Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal launched an investigation of the exclusive
clubs. She felt conflicted about requesting her $5,000 back.

<p>
&quot;If I came off, they wanted someone else because they want eight gifts.
I didn't want someone else in the situation I wanted to get out of,&quot;
Julie said.

<p>
Julie eventually lost friendships with AA friends who had joined the
gifting tables. Though Julie failed in bringing in new participants, she
said she felt shame in trying to recruit AA members because the support
group is about trust and unity. She later warned AA members about tables.

<p>
&quot;You're on a crusade against gifting tables, aren't you?&quot; Jonathan J.
Einhorn, Platt's attorney, asked Julie.

<p>
When Einhorn noted the charitable aspects of the tables, such as
clothing and food drives and a handicapped van donated to a family in
need, Julie said those were &quot;a veneer to cover up the intent to make money.&quot;

<p>
Norm Pattis, Bello's attorney, questioned if Julie had ever been accused
of &quot;histrionics&quot; in her life and noted she has been diagnosed with
mental health issues. Pattis also asked if she was frustrated about the
tables because she failed to recruit members, but she said she was angry
the table destroyed her relationships.

<p>
Cahill later testified she never said tables were legal or tax-free,
though several other witnesses have said otherwise. &quot;I didn't say if
they were legal or illegal because I didn't understand exactly what the
attorney general was upset about,&quot; said Cahill, who has also taught
business law at the University of Bridgeport.

<p>
She corroborated past testimony about her attempts to speak with the
attorney general's office to question the investigation, and said she
proposed making the tables a nonprofit or social club because she wanted
to keep the &quot;sorority&quot; experience going. Platt shot down the idea, she said.

<p>
Cahill made back her $5,000 when another member joined.

<p>
Pattis questioned if she was &quot;exaggerating&quot; to &quot;distance&quot; herself from
tables and prevent her law license from being revoked. She denied it. He
began to discuss a fraud case connected to a company she was once
involved in and will finish cross-examination on the issue today.

<p>
Sally Stedman, a member who made $90,000 on three tables but has since
paid it back, in addition to making $20,000 in charitable contributions
while on the tables, also testified. Stedman said she had retained
attorney Ed Marcus, adding that he said the tables were &quot;neither legal
nor illegal.&quot;

Hello Dee,
<p>
Thanks for the story. Yes, that &quot;gifting club&quot; scam is such an old racket. It's just another
variation on the Ponzi scheme. Newcomers have to pay and pay all of the time,
 and recruit new members,
to give &quot;gifts&quot; to the oldtimers who have worked their way up to the top of the pyramid.
When someone reaches the very top of the pyramid, then it's that person's &quot;big day&quot;, and
they get all of the &quot;gifts&quot; from everybody else in the pyramid.
Then they &quot;graduate&quot; from the pyramid, which opens up the position for somebody below
to move up.
<p>
In theory, because the pyramid is expanding, the people at the top will get back more money
than they paid into the system while they were working their way up the pyramid.
So they can take the money and run, and quit the &quot;club&quot; after they get their
&quot;gifting day&quot;.
<p>
But, as is true of all pyramid schemes, it can only work out for everybody if it keeps expanding
forever. Which is physically impossible. Even if you get everybody on Earth into the pyramid,
then where do you go so that the people at the bottom can get their payoff? Mars?

<p>
Combining a &quot;gifting table&quot; with A.A. is really cynical. People who are new to A.A. are newly-detoxed
and cloudy-headed and shaky, and here is some con artist telling them that they need
to join the club and pay to give a &quot;gift&quot; to an oldtimer?
To call that practice &quot;corrupt&quot; seems like too mild of a word.
The words &quot;heartless&quot; and &quot;exploitative&quot; also come to mind.
<p>
The rest of it, the murder (which wasn't explained in this story), and the
Mafia-like rabbits-head intimidation and all, just goes to show that A.A. is a very dangerous
place.
(Doesn't the rabbit's head remind you of the horse's head in the movie <i>The Godfather</i>?)
Honestly, how could they expect anything else? Gather all of the alcoholics
and addicts and ex-convicts and parolees in a room, and imagine that it suddenly
becomes Heaven on Earth because they yammer some slogans and Steps from a
nineteen-thirties cult religion?
<p>
And I love this little
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i> attack</a>:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;You're on a crusade against gifting tables, aren't you?&quot;
</font>
<p>
That's as dumb as saying,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;You're on a crusade against child molesters, aren't you?&quot;
</font>
<p>
As if &quot;being on a crusade&quot; invalidates the accusations and makes everything okay.
<p>
By the way, pyramid schemes are totally illegal, and the IRS definitely wants their share
of any income that you get.
<p>
One of the participants tried to claim that &quot;gifting tables&quot; are legal because &quot;it's all just
gifts.&quot; Wrong. It's really an investment scheme, no different from a Ponzi scheme. The idea
is that you pay some money into the system, and then you get two or three times as much 
&#8212; or more &#8212; back later.
Calling the payments &quot;gifts&quot; is just a cover.
The dead giveaway of that is the first half of this sentence:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Julie said she believed that when you give a gift to someone, it comes back to you
and that she appreciated the group's oft-spoken goal of helping women.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, she expected the money to come back to her. It wasn't &quot;a gift&quot;.
It was an investment.  And of course the second half of the sentence is just a
rationalization, claiming that it was to &quot;help women&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject: 	AA Cult-ism<br>

<p>
Just read through most of your wonderful run-down of aa cultism... I myself went to
rehab in 1999 &#8212; then as a result, became a sober recoving alcoholic and havent had a
drink since... for the first 8 years or so, I went to at least one if not 2 meetings
a day &#8212; I even started meetings that are still active without my presence... but as
my personality struggled to come back to the surface, I found myself arguing more
and more in meetings, and eventually being openly ridiculed when I stopped using AA
lingo and started just speaking from my own experience... I don't go anymore, and
now I run into people from AA who look overly concerned that I must be drinking,
etc....

<p>
Anyway &#8212; it is a cult, and some people need cults &#8212; because their mind does not have
the energy or ability to be at peace with itself and handle things without someone
else abusing them into a behavior pattern.

<p>
I am really glad you wrote a well researched criticism of the AA as a cult
perspective. A lot of people feel like they want to get out of AA but have this
huge fear that they will drink again... which is not true much of the time.

<p>
Thanks

Hello Billy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and congratulations for your sobriety. And I'm really glad to
hear that you kept your own mind and can think for yourself.
<p>
The only line I disagree with is the one about some people needing cults.
I've thought about that.  I have often considered the idea of having a
&quot;good cult&quot; that would encourage people to get clean and
sober, something that would harness the <i>esprit de corps</i> of A.A. or N.A., and give
the same cameraderie and &quot;fellowship&quot;, but without the falsehoods
and lies and put-downs and harmful parts of Steppism.
Alas, it seems that you can't do it. The cult framework just inherently leads
to evil things.  Like power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="_blank">Synanon</a>
was supposed to be such a good cult, one that would get people
off of drugs. For a while, it seemed to work great, but in the end,
it degenerated into lies, intimidation, beatings and attempted murder
of dissidents and dropouts.
<p>
Likewise,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones" target="_blank">Rev. Jim Jones's <i>People's Temple</i></a>
was hailed as a wonderful new rehab program that got a zillion alcoholics and
addicts off of the streets of San Francisco and Oakland, and into church.
But in the end, Jim Jones went crazy and they all committed suicide together.

<p>
Yes, weak-minded people need <i>something</i>, but I don't think it's a cult
that they need.
<p>
Also, giving people misinformation about addiction and recovery actually makes recovery
harder. When Dr. George Vaillant tested A.A.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">he found that A.A.
had the highest death rate</a> of any treatment for alcohol abuse that he studied.

<p>
Have a good day now.

I knew a woman who was fresh in AA, told to stop her psych meds &amp; when attempting
suicide during a meeting in the meeting bathroom, she was shunned &amp; banned from the

that teaches tolerance &amp; love with open arms to all who want to be clean/sober?

is some pretty

drunkenly around for most of the film, before being saved by the magic
words of admitting he is an alcoholic, and spending 6 years in jail, that
he could have avoided, if he had told a simple lie that affected no living

Hi Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I'll have to find that movie and see it.
<p>
I find the A.A.-promoting school of movie-making rather curious.
I suspect that the script-writers are split
between ignorance and fanatical proselytization.
<p>
That is, some writers literally don't know what they
are talking about, but they heard that A.A. is a wonderful secret society that rehabilitates
degenerate alcoholics by getting them admitting their faults and praying,
and they think that the going-to-A.A. bit can provide a happy ending to the story.
<p>
But the other writers are A.A. members and true believers who want to
<i> &quot;Carry The Message To The Alcoholic Who Still Suffers&quot;</i>,
so they really lay it on.

<p>
This movie sort of sounds like the latter case, doesn't it?

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Orange.

<p>
I've been reading through your information and it's an impressive amount of
work that you've put together.  I'm so curious about something, though.

<p>
You seem angry.  Preoccupied with this.  I can certainly understand a
passion about just about any topic, but I'm wondering what you are gaining
out of keeping the anger?  It seems like a lot of energy.

<p>
M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Megan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You know, that is such a common A.A. complaint, &quot;You are angry.&quot;
I just got another letter saying the same thing a few days ago.
(<a href="orange-letters338.html#James_B" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Unfortunately, Steppers get indoctrinated with the belief that if you are angry, you are
&quot;<a href="orange-letters16.html#axiom" target="_blank">axiomatically spiritually wrong</a>&quot;.
Not so.
That is how the cult cripples you and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">keeps you from feeling your feelings</a>.
There is nothing wrong with being angry at crooks who hurt your friends and family.

<p>
Now there are two possible answers to your question:

<ol>

<p><li> I gave the first answer in that previous letter:
&quot;I'm not all that angry. If you want to see angry, you should read the messages on my forum
from some of the people who wasted 10 or 20 years in A.A. Now those people are really angry
about how they were deceived for so long.&quot;

<p><li>
And the second answer is, &quot;Yes, and I have every reason to be angry at stupid parrots who keep
on jabbering the same untrue nonsense, year after year, and causing sick people to die,
year after year, and always refusing to learn anything.&quot;
<p>
Crazy Steppers who
imagine that they are doing the right thing tell people not to take their medications, and
then the sick people die or commit suicide. Steppers repeat the same untrue dogma about alcohol
abuse and recovery, and make it harder for people to recover. And then Steppers claim to have
the best method for recovery.
<p>
No, actually, they have the worst. When Dr. George E. Vaillant, who just loves A.A. (still),
and who went on to become a Trustee of A.A.,
spent the better part of 20 years foisting A.A. on sick alcoholics and trying hard to prove
that A.A. works, he discovered that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">no way of treating
alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction produced a higher death rate than Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
(And yet, Dr. Vaillant is still one of the biggest promoters of A.A. in the world. He continues
to promote A.A. even though he proved in valid clinical tests that it doesn't work.)
<p>
Which leads to the next big problem with A.A.: They won't learn. They refuse to learn anything
new and improve their methods. They continue to push the same cult religion from 1935 as the
best and only answer, and they won't change anything because they arrogantly insist that they
already have a working answer &#8212; even the &quot;best&quot; answer.
<p>
So more people die.
<p>
For more reasons to be angry, you should read some of
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the A.A. horror stories, here</a>.

Have a good day now.

<p>
Hello I  stumbled upon your  website a few days ago and have found it to be an
interesting read so far.

<p>
As you I don't believe in the need for AA/NA I have many friends who go and swear by
it and they often try and make me feel as if I will relapse if I don't start to
attend the meetings with him which in turn makes me not want to go even more, I have
tried some meetings but I never felt at ease about this , it did feel as if
everything being was pre-programmed into them, it just didn't sit right with me
ever.

<p>
In my opinion I find NA and AA to  be another means to widening  your network of
users and I have personally seen many people fall like by making new friends or
getting into relationships with others, I  do not believe in their belief of living
in fear that you could relapse  if you do not attend the meetings and work the
steps, also that we are born this way, I don't think anyone is born bad people make
good and  bad decisions in the course of life, I refuse to believe  we are all
condemned for life to this misery it is all about course correction in my book,
finding the right path again  in your own way, whether you find it or not is
entirely up to you not anyone or anything else

<p>
As many I have found my own way and I believe I am much better for it .

<p>
Thanks

<p>
Kind regards<br>

Hello Gurpreet,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.  And I'm really happy to hear that you are better.

<p>
I have to agree with all of your points. Yes, they constantly use
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">the fear-mongering trick</a>
of telling people that they will relapse and die drunk in a gutter if they leave A.A.:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Either <i>Work A Strong Program</i>, or your fate will be Jails, Institutions, or Death.&quot;
</font>
Yeh, that really gets old after a while. Especially when you discover that the vast majority
of the sober people got sober without A.A.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
Like 75% or 80% of the alcoholics who successfully sober up do it alone, without A.A.</a>

<p>
What really got to me was the constant appeals to believe. The speaker exhorted
the audience to stop thinking, and just believe in &quot;the program&quot;.
Don't think, don't doubt, just do it.
That was what made me realize that I was sitting in a cult meeting.
I remember that final moment of truth at an N.A. meeting where I said to myself,
&quot;It might be fun to discard reason and just believe in this
organization and be part of a 'happy, laughing family', but it's just a cult.&quot;

<p>
A little while back, one of my readers found this article that also complained about 12-Step rehab making
people worse and giving young people access to harder drugs:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In my case, labeling myself an alcoholic paved the way for me to take on the &quot;addict&quot; persona, and I got much worse before I got better. After treatment, I traded in my college friends for the criminal ones I met in recovery, and in turn, I gained access to a variety of hard drugs.
<p>
That is perhaps the most disheartening aspect of 12-step recovery and inpatient care: Because most of their AA colleagues are older, the adolescents I met in treatment found more drug connections, party buddies and rehab romances than they did mentors, counselors and long-term sober friends.<br>

From:  	&quot;Chris&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Here s my story :D<br>

<p>
Hey there!

<p>
You ve been my &quot;mentor&quot; for 10 days now, i ve been searching and readin stuff in
here and make my day :D. I have to congratulate for this site that makes ppl feel
confortable after leavin this cult. Dude u are really awesome in this!!! I ve been
in a private AA-type center for 3 months and i managed to say gtf out of my life, i
can do it alone!! U ve helped me much so i can deal with my day without misery and
self-harm. I m from Greece so my eng wont be good...
<p>
So, i was an internet junkie, and that made me lose the control of my life,
couldnt do anything, i was miserable and felt MANY MANY times that i m cursed. I m
cursed to live like that, sitting in front of my PC and playing games or listening
to songs or searching for wierd stuff or porn cause the life outside wasnt made for
me... I asked for help from my father and he adviced me to handle this problem
through religion. It was hard for me to go to a church and confess and find a
solution there. I told him than i need a psychiatrist or someone like this
profession. So he found out a private program in my town and I went there. 1st
month was ok. The guys there (drug addicts and alcohol addicts) were cool and the
councilors were a bit of helpful. I found there a great company to restart my life
and start going to my college again. I started to feel good in the mornings but the
evenings where so boring and full of misery. I was also &quot;IN DENIAL&quot; 10x
a day and &quot;I DIDNT KNOW HOW&quot; to deal with things cause every thought of mine was my
&quot;monkey's&quot; thought, not a GOOD one. I was sayin Ok u should know better than me and
went on. The program i was in was called open-type cause my problem wasnt so bad as
drug addicts or alcohol ones. So i had my time to go home or for a coffee after 6
pm. The 1st strange thing was when my parents attended to a group for parents. My
dad that is religious started his sharing about how good ppl are in this program
that related God with psychology. THen he tried to tell a story of Klaus Kenneth (i
recommend both of his books) and the councilor stopped him telling him that we are
not here to procelytize other members to UR God, inspite the fact that she has the
same God. My 1st question: Are we supposed to share WHATEVER we want in a meeting
of AAs? My dad didnt tell me that time about this fact cause as he said later he
found me in a good mood to make me wonder about small
probs like that... After that incident both of the councilors were kinda afraid of
my parents...
<p>
Second month was good too but ended bad. I was for coffee with ppl from the
program when i realised our cituation. THen i ended in a convo with on of my
councilors telling him that i might end this program cause i cant see any progress
to me nor to otherz. -Hey, dont u see ur situation now? Do you think that u could
manage to be like that on your own? You are in denial and you dont follow the
program as you were supposed to. That s why. And dont even think that the progress
and solution is found in one day or two. You have to work the program months with us
and then on your own in a lifetime. I went to a priest after that without listening
to any shit of what he told me. When i was outside the church after my confess to
God i was feeling damn good. And yeah it worked. I tried no to be selfish and follow
the priests orders and continue to go there for a month or so so to be cool enough
to walk in my shoes alone. I went to a NAs Christmas party and
it was awful, i dont recommend to any1 to go there :P. When i wrote my thougths
about it  I WAS WRONG again, not the party but me!!! I wasnt dancing and that was a
reason that i didnt follow my treatment and make things easier for me and for them
to end this torture one day earlier. ( What a wierd thingy, if u dont dance u are
not treated ). Then i went to an internet cafe to play some games for 2 days and i
had to tell this to them. RELAPSE!!! U just did a RELAPSE! You dont work with us, u
work better with the priest, and u believe in God more than to the program ( this
is my conclusion of all the wierd stuff they told me that day). You trust more the
priest that us and that is harmful for u, priests dont know about addictions, and
addiction is not a sin that u can confess it and let God to take it from you. YOU
HAVE TO WORK THE PROGRAM AND STOP GOING TO THE PRIEST (yeah we told it 3 times and
i am not insane, and i heard it!!). THat s OK i said. They
tried to tell me that i was &quot;working&quot; my relapse a month ago with not attending to
private convos with them and not working on the stuff  they told me to work on. I
hadnt started to write on the steps. I was writing about concequences of my
addiction, the story of my life and things about anger... Damn, i wanna write a
whole book to include the weird things i lived in there. Oh and by the way i was
alcoholic ( i was a drunk kid many times of my past life like some peeps do in
this age from 16 to 30) and i was a drug addict cause i was smokin pot. I have to
say that i dont like alcohol or pot cause when i overdo it with these things i
feel awful and i stopped doing that a while ago, so i dont realise myself as an AA
or a NA but they did. Back to the relapse. I was also told that i was
pietist. THey had a prob that i met a priest once in a while, 2 times a month, for
15 mins and he made me to trust him more than them that they had me most part of the
day... It s insane!!!! Then, they started to teach me that masturbating was good in
treatment period to see if i was abnormal. Sorry guys, but my secuality is a part
that any psychologist can touch for myself. I m regular in sexual habbits and also i
try to aboid masturbating cause i dont feel good with my relation to my God... They
are christians too and they were telling me to stop being a christian till the
treatment perion is ended. But this period is lifetime so.....
<p>
Next problem was the 1st step. They tried to tell me that u are not responsible
for ur addiction, u are born with that and u didnt have the choice to avoid it. Oh
man, pain, anger and misery on trying to tell them that I DONT HAVE A FKIN PROB WITH
THAT, i can continue the steps ignoring that paragraph, considering the addiction as
a conclusion of my choices etc. They insist to stopacting like a pietist and not
take the weight of this cause addiction is in ur genes, u were made sick like
special needs ppl. Oh man, in the 12steps that AA dont wanna know u discribe exactly
my thought about this. I dont wanna believe in a God that made me sick, my God made
me in free will, i can choose the good or bad taking for myself the conciquences!!!
I couldnt find the exact words to tell them my point of view and my belief and after
reading many articles in your site i believe that even if iwas good as u they d
always tell me that i am IN DENIAL. FK them!

<p>
Last day, i was all the day long to the building where the program takes place
and done with the things there and i was about to go to the priest at 5pm (one hour
before the program ends for the day) like i had done many times before. The
councilor got so pissed off like i had done another relapse. Cool mis, chill,  i
have asked for permission for that many times ago and i took the  OK why are u so
mad? U should work on anger pamphlet to control your anger cause this behaviour is
not allowed in here :P. I went inspite of her &quot;suggestion&quot; ( i dont take
responsibility of this thing, you must stay and stick to the program). The next day
i went there and when she started to SHOUT of what i ve done to myself geting me out
of the program (for an hour? damn i was a bad bad boy) i told her that i m not
staying here anymore. You speak about God and when someone (me) tries to find God
you &quot;suggest&quot; not to be so quick with that and weird things that we say
this and the next day we dont suggest the same thing. I think that i was a lot of
patient with ur bs. THen the last battle, that was ended that i was insane (their
conclusion), i answered to their questions with honesty and there last words were
that i was lost in translations of their suggestion. DAMN, I said the words they
told me a day or 10 or 2 months ago. I dont have such a problem with my mind and i
remember these things cause they were contrasted.
<p>
And all this by payin 1000$ a month...Yeah it was a good experience and i had to
get through this cause i ve chosen a method that me and all christians should not.
We got a God that can do this. We got the people and the books that give advice on
how to &quot;cure&quot; such a &quot;sin&quot;.
<p>
Some of weird things  i ve heard from people who we were with in the program and
they remain my beloved friends in spite the fact that we have different opinions
about addictions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. I thank God that born me with the &quot;gene&quot; of addiction cause when i followed
the 12-step program i became a better man.

<p><li>
2. If you drink a single beer or a drug u wont be my friend anymore but if u
continue being an internet junkie we can be friends.

<p><li>
3. U are going to take heroin ( i havent till now and i wont forever) cause u
went to the program and u find us the heroin addicts and u ve learnt things about
heroin.

<p>
<li>
4. 1st convo:
<ul>
<li>
-why u finally out of the program and u still attend some meetings of NAs outside
the program?(that are free)
<li>
-cause if I find it good, i dont have nothing to do this time and i find it like
going for a coffee with friends and strangers.
</ul>

After 2 weeks:
<ul>
<li>
-Hey man, inspite ur difference u have with us u have to attend to some free NA s
meetings.
<li>
-I have no time, i got tons of stuff to do rather than attending a meeting where is
so much pain and misery but i ll support u when u will open a meeting next time.
<li>
-Hey you dont know how meetings are useful. U should go many times a week and then
see how it works.
<li>
-Right, i dont know, i m in denial. tell me how it worked for you to see if i  want
it to work like that in me.
<li>
-It works for me...
<li>
-Yeah, but how?
<li>
-You ll see if u are attending 4-5 times a week.
<li>
-Nah thanks, but what does it give you? Xcept of SOMETHING AND YOU LL SEE?
<li>
-.... you are in denial.
<li>
-right, i am and i like how i am, and i m a normal man and you are two, in spite the
fact that you believe the opposite.
<li>
-I think that i am a normal man too.
<li>
-But 1st step says the oposite.
<li>
-Yeah right, does a normal man stand in front of his pc for 24 hours?
<li>
-no
<li>
-So you werent a normal man.
<li>
-Yeah i wasnt, but i am now and i have the choice to become abnormal again and that
doesnt have to do with genes.
<li>
-Oh man you have a serious prob.
<li>
-Yeah i have, a prob to tell you the truth cause u are heretic.
<li>
-Dont u see u are insane?
<li>
-Yeah i do. How s life?
<li>
-Boring....
</ul>

<p>
<li>
5.We should be in the same &quot;class&quot; as special needs people. ( darn that s really
annoying)
</ul>

<p>
So, that s all i have to say, my xperience... Thanks again for all the staff that
made me think that i m good with myself and dont want a cult program for my
addiction. I m not an AA or a NA, drugs and alcohol isnt my prob, i can live
without them!!!! Keep up the good work dude and enlighten ppl with truth!

<p>
Take care, Chris.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Chris,
<p>
Thanks for a great letter, and I'm glad to hear that things are getting better for you.
Your story says so much. I'm adding your letter to
<a href="orange-horrors.html#Chris" target="_blank">the list of A.A. horror stories</a>.
Technically, your story isn't so much about A.A. as it is about 12-Step quackery, but: same difference.
A.A. <i><b>is</b></i> 12-Step quackery.
The crazy A.A. dogma says that doing the confession routines of an old pro-Nazi cult religion from
the nineteen-thirties will cure all of your problems. That's insane.
And that is so wrong that it is criminal &#8212; practicing medicine without a license.

<p>
Here in Portland, Oregon, we have a crazy church &#8212; &quot;The Church of the
Followers of Christ&quot; &#8212; that kills a child every few years. They believe
that prayer is the only proper way to heal a disease. They will not take their children to a 
doctor, not ever, not for anything, no matter what. So when the children get seriously ill, they die.
And then the parents get prosecuted for manslaughter. It's been happening year after year.
And the parents get sentenced to prison and probation, and they still refuse to learn.
Faith healing just doesn't work.
<p>
But the crazy Steppers who run &quot;rehab centers&quot; and &quot;recovery programs&quot;
think that it does. And they hurt a lot of people. Some of the patients die.

<p>
First off, you are not <i>in denial</i>. 
You began your letter by describing your problem with being obsessed with the Internet and video games.
You aren't in denial.  Being in denial is like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I'm not an alcoholic. I'm not drinking so much that I have to quit drinking. You people are just
exaggerating how much I drink. It isn't a problem. I don't have a problem.&quot;
</font>
Refuse to see the problem, and refuse to fix it.
<p>
You obviously do not have the problem of being in denial. You began your letter by describing
your problem. Then you sought help and treatment for it.

<p>
In general, I find that when I was being obsessive about something, it was because I was trying
to avoid dealing with or feeling some other pain.
It might be the pain of how tobacco or alcohol was slowly killing me,
or anxiety about what was happening in my life,
or bad old memories of child abuse... It was some kind of pain in the here and now that I didn't
want to deal with, so I tried to avoid it by concentrating (obsessively) on something else.
<p>
You might want to look at that.
<p>
The thing about them objecting to you seeing your priest is so revealing. They
really want to own you and convert you to their beliefs, and they can't stand one
bit of competion from a priest of a different religion.

<p>
Yes, it's a crime to charge people $1000 per month for quack medicine and abuse.


<p>
About your last point, &quot;we should be in the same class as special-needs people&quot;,
I have to laugh.
That is such self-indulgent narcissistic nonsense. But some A.A. people do that.
What comes to mind is the scene in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005436/http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s09e14-bloody-mary" target="_blank">the
<i>South Park</i> satire of A.A.</a> where a long line of sick and crippled people were
waiting in line for their turn to get miraculously healed by a bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary.
(Please watch that. You'll get a lot of laughs out of it.)

Stan's father, Randy, was in the line to get healed of &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
When one of Randy's friends learned that he was an alcoholic, he said, &quot;Oh you
poor thing!&quot; and pushed Randy's wheelchair to the front of the line, past
the dying cancer patients and cripples and the blind, saying, &quot;Make way,
make way. Alcoholic coming through.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day now. And a good life.

Subject:  	Thank You<br>

<p>
Hello, I would like to thank you for your website and the information.
What you have written is amazingly insightful and I am very grateful
that you have shared your thoughts and findings with the world.

<p>
I have been addicted to alcohol and drugs in the past and have healed
myself without intervention. Recently a family member went into an inpatient
12 step program and I began to research its principles. What I found was a belief
system that insulted my intelligence, my religion, and science. I was unable to
articulate my thoughts about this program and you have beautifully done this for me.

<p>
You are brilliant. I respect and appreciate your logic and communication
skills more than I could say in an email. If you have any other websites,
about any topic at all, please send me the links. I would like to hear about
anything else that you have to say or find interest in.

<p>
Thanks again for all the time you out into your analysis of 12 step programs.
Thanks for putting into words what my heart and mind could not.

<p>
Best Wishes, Randall

Hello Randall,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and all of the thanks and compliments. That is so flattering that I'd better
watch my ego or I'll get a fat head.
<p>
I don't have any other web sites, <i>per se</i>. (I'm going to eventually start up one about
photography, and I'm thinking about a &quot;rip off&quot; web site and forum where people can complain
about how corporations have treated them.)
I do have a group on Facebook called simply
&quot;Orange Papers&quot;. And, something that confuses even me,
I am also &quot;Orange Papers&quot; on Facebook.
(I'm always trying to figure out which one I'm looking at now.)
<p>
I'm actually trying to move away from Facebook. I was just about to cancel my Facebook account
when a nice woman started the Orange Papers group for me, and it immediately attracted a
bunch of members, so now I'm sort of stuck with Facebook for a while.
<p>
I'd recommend the Orange Papers forum instead:

<p>
I don't Tweet, because Twitter will steal the copyright of anything and everything that I post.
(Did you know that when a woman posted a cell phone picture of Capt. Sullenberger landing his
plane in the Hudson that Twitter took the picture and sold it to news agencies without giving
her the money?)

<p>
Have a good day now.

Terry, think the above is the piece and it appears it's 2008, so this may be one
that I remember you've already covered.

Hi Terry, just saw this pop up on the Smart Listserve and thought you probably have
the background and knowledge to mine it if it isn't something you've already done.
There is no link/date to the material that Doc. S. is referring to, but I did find
Henry's email address:
smartrecovery@sbcglobal.net.

<p>
Good to read on the OP that your health is well.

I found this and thought I'd share it in the hope that more information from a
reputable journal would be interesting. Not as an attack &#8212; if it works for someone,
that's great.

12-Step Treatment for Alcohol and Substance Abuse Revisited: Best Available Evidence
Suggests Lack of Effectiveness or Harm

<p>
The essence of that paper is: The previous so-called &quot;studies&quot; that declared that
A.A. worked great, and much better than CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) at a
Veteran's Administration center were flawed, fraudulent, and (dare I say it?)
downright faked. And guess who did that faked V.A. study? The notorious
Humphreys-Moos team of professional A.A. propagandists.
<p>
<font color="blue" face="Times, Times Roman">
[Long quote from
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank">this letter</a>
 snipped out.]
</font>

<p>
The corrected outcome results (likely 0 to 15 percent remission for substance abuse)
support the conclusion that the type of realistic community 12-Step based
intervention described is at best ineffective and likely less beneficial than no
treatment.
<p>
As applied to practice, these results appear to obligate professionals in the
helping fields, on the principle of nonmaleficence, at the least to avoid referring
clients to 12-Step-based treatment programs. Under the principle of informed
consent, professionals appear obligated to inform prospective clients that
empirically based research suggests that 12-Step based treatment for abuse of
alcohol or other substances is at best ineffective.

Hello Jim,
<p>
Thanks for the reminder of something great. Yes, I posted that article before.
Happily, I have both the preliminary version and the final version, here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank"><i>The International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i> refutes the Humphreys-Moos study</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters247.html#Mona_Lisa" target="_blank">the final updated version</a>
</ul>

<p>
That article is a real bomb-shell, because it methodically dismantles and refutes
the faked &quot;studies&quot; that purported to show that 12-Step treatment works
just as well as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
And the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction isn't just any old supermarket tabloid.
(And I have to laugh when it occurs to me that it isn't &quot;council-approved literature&quot; either.)

<p>
Have a good day now.

Those eagles have chosen their nest site well. That tree has so many forks and branches

provides a very secure pocket for a nest.

Hi Ray,
<p>
Yes, I imagine that the fear may keep some people from drinking, sometimes, for a while.
Alas, manipulating people with fear is ugly and counter-productive.
<p>
I think that the fear will eventually wear off, and then the people have nothing
better to fall back on.
When people lose their fear and start thinking,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html#lizard_thoughts" target="_blank">
 &quot;Well, maybe I could handle just one...&quot;</a>,
it's the kiss of death. Without the fear, what do they have?

<p>
I think it's much better to give people more facts and a solid foundation, so that they
can rationally respond to such thoughts with counter-thoughts like,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Maybe you could handle just one,
and it might be okay, but if it's okay, then that will be very encouraging, and that will
soon lead to just another one, which might also be okay. And if that's okay, then that
will lead to just another one, which might also
be okay at first, but eventually it will lead back to more and more okay drinking
until the situation ends up back where you were when you quit in the first place.
Remember why you quit in the first place? It's just plain easier if you don't go there.&quot;
<br>

Have a good day now.
