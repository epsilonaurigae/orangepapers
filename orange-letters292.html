Subject:  	Re: AA<br>

<p>
Thank you for the page and replies. I go to AA maybe twice a week. Firstly
because I committed myself to be a room opener for a while one day of the
week, and secondly because some people have no where else to go, so whether
it is a cult or whatever makes no difference to me. They do not share my
entire belief system, nor do I feel I am too 'above' anyone on this planet,
it's all good if just my being there without saying anything helps someone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Steve,
<p>
You sound like you could also be a member of
<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">the Newcomer's Rescue League</a>.
</font>
<p>
I have very mixed feelings about ACIM. I have the book here, but have not
opened beyond the first two days (and that was a while ago). Something is
fishy in Denmark with that thing. I will not go so far as to say it is a
hoax, but rather that as far as I can tell there is half baked truth, some
wisdom, and potpourri and B.S., as supposedly Jesus was talking through an
atheist to come up with the program yet they specifically state their God is
not the one in the bible. Huh? With that.. I dropped them like a hot potato.
There is nothing they have to offer, in fact, I am not sure what they offer?
Please do not answer that.. LOL

<p>
Thanks again. As long as I am not at AA too much, it's cool. I wrote 'bottom
of the barrel' in the sense that some folks have no where else to go, no
money, no help...at least not around here. Others with cash go to treatment
centers. I did (even though I did not have much), but ended up getting
completely sober , straightened out, (with no compulsion to pick up again
after day 2), and have begun a spiritual journey of my own (as should be for
each person). The 'library' is stacking up with some very interesting books
and exploration (all closely scrutinized for what to me is the 'b.s.
factor')...I want to dig deep. Enjoy reading writings of Jung, Boehmen,
Moltmann, Alexander Pope, the Bible, inspecting the Ego and the Archetype,
Dissolving the Ego, Some of Allan Watts who has some interesting concepts in
the Wisdom of Insecurity, as well as  David Hawkins and Brennan Mannings.

<p>
The AA Big Book? Have never actually read that much of it at all...like
everything else in this world today, it is a theology and a philosophy a bit
taken mostly from the teachings in the bible..much of the Traditions are
actually pretty good....equality and union are good. However, I wanted to
move beyond being an alcoholic the rest of my life. no way....that is a
chapter yes, time to go on to the next ones. Listening to music by the Group
&quot;Yes&quot; (Jon Anderson very spiritual)...moving onward and ahead into the realm
of self-improvement. May your day be grand. Cheers! Stephen

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, never read much of the <i>Big Book</i>? Lucky you. You didn't miss much.
<p>
But you have one big misconception there: the <i>Big Book</i> teachings do not come
from the Bible, they come from the teachings of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman,
a heretical renegade Lutheran minister who preferred the company of Nazis. Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-rroot030.html</a>

<p>
The A.A. claim that the 12 Steps and other parts of the <i>Big Book</i> come from the Bible,
or &quot;are Biblical&quot;, or are &quot;compatible with Christianity&quot;, is an often-repeated A.A. claim,
but it just isn't true at all.
You will also hear that Father Ed Dowling became Bill Wilson's
priest and spiritual advisor after he read the first edition of the
<i>Big Book</i> and decided that Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps resembled the
Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius.
What A.A. defenders have done is poke through the Bible
and find some lines that sound similar to the 12 Steps, and then
claim that A.A. theology is &quot;Biblical&quot;.
It's just like a Rorschach ink blot test &#8212; seeing things that aren't really there.
That is no different than claiming that the Bible approves of slavery, polygamy, and the
robbery and slaughter of your non-Jewish neighbors because of a few mentions of it
in the Old Testament, particularly in the books of the warlord Moses.  Look here:<br>

Your writing is illogical, inconsistent and formally distorted. An
intelligent reader can pick that out from your writing. You have not
fully addressed my strongest points; you would rather demonize me as
an AA supporter and refute anything that contradicts your limited view
of the world. My thoughts are coherent and backed by facts and
relevant arguments.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Andrew,
<p>
"Formally distorted?" Now that's a new accusation that I had not heard before.
<p>
Not addressed what &quot;strongest points&quot;? You keep making strange statements like that
A.A. is good because it has a &quot;compelling origin myth&quot;, and A.A. meetings are cheaper
than &quot;comprehensive health care&quot;. What strong points are you talking about?

</font>
<p>
I went to psychiatrist because of depression. He recommended AA for me
personally. His credentials are more impressive than yours, he's the
senior therapist at a major depression center. I followed his advice
because I had paid for it. Despite the empirical evidence that AA is
ineffective, I am positive that it has been a positive experience for
me. I do not recommend it for other people; I also acknowledge that
negative experiences with flawed philosophies can have a positive
effect on you in the long run.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you went to a misguided doctor who recommended a cult religion as treatment
for a psychiatric disorder. I've heard of such
doctors before. They should be stripped of their license to practice medicine.
<p>
As you have just admitted, the empirical evidence is that A.A. does not work
and is harmful.
</font>
<p>
I do not attend AA meetings any more. I do not believe their dogma. I
picked out a couple of good habits and attitudes and rejected anything
that seemed like mumbo-jumbo. I concentrate on socializing with people
from all walks of life. I do not rule out attending AA in the future,
likewise, I have no specific plan to attend.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay. Now you just need to clean out a few old ideas about how A.A. is such a good thing.
</font>
<p>
I believe that alcoholism and dependence is a unique life problem that
can lead to a chronic cycle of dependence. It isn't exactly like other
mental illnesses or physical diseases because of alcohol's unique
social status; although, there might be important parallels to those
concepts. Most people go into remission spontaneously. The popular
academic I agree most with on the subject of addiction is Dr. Stanton
Peele.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, alcohol addiction is not at all unique. Drug addiction, food addiction, sex addiction,
gambling addiction,
and many other kinds of obsessive-compulsive disorders
are very similar.
<p>
I very much agree with Dr. Stanton Peele that at least half of the addicts go into remission by themselves.
</font>
<p>
Communication is a two-way street. You don't read closely, rather you
skim over someone's e-mail until you recall a somewhat similar
argument and you cut and paste a response from a prior e-mail. That
demonstrates you don't respect me as your audience enough to actually
actively read my words.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have very much read your words.
</font>
<p>
I take the time to read your prose and think about it; I'd like the
same respect. In addition, it makes you sound unorganized and
scattered as you skip from one pet subject to the next.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I've spent a lot of time reading your words.
</font>
<p>
You are not objective. You are too emotional about the issue of AA.
That anger and passion lead you to fully accept any negative report
regarding AA and to discount anything positive. Your own concept of
alcoholism is as muddled as the one used in AA. Is it a disease? Are
people morally culpable under its influence? Can the dependent
alcoholic stop using at any time? You adopt whatever stance allows you
the most rhetorical leverage over the AA view. However, it isn't a
coherent answer for people looking for advice. It also undermines your
results; it's easy to criticize other people when you won't let your
own views be pinned down.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but I'm not accepting that argument. I rely on the best clinical tests of A.A. Consequently,
my personal emotions are pretty irrelevant.
<p>
And I think my ideas about &quot;alcoholism&quot; are pretty clear:
<ol>
<li> Is it a disease?  No.
<li> Are people morally culpable under its influence? Yes.
<li> Can the dependent alcoholic stop using at any time? Yes, they can quit any
time they want to &#8212; although they may not really want to until things get very bad.
</ol>

</font>
<p>
You say, &quot;Just quit drinking!&quot; Of course, this ignores the fact that
chronic alcoholics may die due to withdrawal seizures without alcohol.
Or that some people have such poor self-control that they simply
cannot stop drinking without continual surveillance. You typify
alcoholics as having a similar life to yours and responding to the
same treatment. That is simply mistaken; alcoholics have a million
different case histories and degrees of dependence.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I know all about withdrawal seizures without alcohol. I went through them myself.
You can read the story here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters19.html#withdrawal" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters19.html#withdrawal</a><br>
and here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters166.html#DTs" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters166.html#DTs</a>
<p>
And I still quit, and stayed quit for three years, in spite of the seizures.
So much for alcoholics being unable to quit.
<p>
I do not stereotype alcoholics and say that they are all just like me.
It's A.A. that stereotypes alcoholics, and says that they are all just like
Bill Wilson, disgusting manipulative dishonest selfish monsters. Look here:<br>

<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-us_stupid_drunks.html</a>
<p>
Then A.A. declares that a one-size-fits-all cure, the 12 Steps, is the cure for
that selfish monster.
</font>
<p>
I never said that people deserve bad consequences because they
continue to believe in illusions or that the mass of common people
deserve to be lied to. I do not believe that I am an elite who can
handle the truth, unlike the pathetic common man. That is the root of
your comparison of me to Nazis and Communists (talk about loaded
words).

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, you are twisting my words. I did not say that people deserved bad
consequences for believing in illusions. Now they may get that result,
but I never used the word &quot;deserve&quot;. (I know, that is one of the loaded
words that SMART warns against, so I watch it very closely.)
<p>
The fact still remains that when someone argues that we should leave the
common people their fairy tales and their crazy beliefs and their happy delusions, that is an
elitist argument where the speaker assumes that he is one of the grown-ups
who can handle the truth, while the others are just mental children.
<p>
And if someone accepts that belief, then it is just one more step to believe
that it is okay to lie to the &quot;children&quot; and feed them some more myths
and fallacies, and it is always &quot;for their own good&quot;, of course.
(Our politicians do that to us every day.)
</font>
<p>
I said that deluded people deserve our compassion, our forgiveness and
our respect for failing to be perfect human beings. I would never
propagate something that I thought was dishonest, however, I am not
able to defeat all the lies and bullshit that surround us. For that
reason, I accept them, not as the moral ideal, but as temporary
phenomena in our morally imperfect world. AA is relatively benign.
There are too many truly sinister organizations to waste our righteous
anger on benign organizations.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I do not &quot;accept&quot; bad organizations that propagate lies and misinformation.
And you are again hinting that A.A. is &quot;benign&quot;, which it is not.
Again, you are pulling a switcheroo and first trying to come off as rational
and realistic, then trying to surreptitiously slip in some praise of Alcoholics Anonymous.


</font>
<p>
You think you are a White Knight who can dispel all the lies and
muddled thinking surrounding addiction. I got news for you, AO, you've
picked a nearly impossible goal and it is warping your thinking.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a baloney argument. What you are preaching is defeatism.
</font>
<p>
Take a little break from calling all the people you disagree with
Nazis and ask yourself one thing: Look over your writing on this
website and pretend another person wrote it. Ask yourself one
question: which word fits the tone of this prose better? &quot;Angry&quot; or
&quot;objective&quot;?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Why take a break and let untruth win?
<p>
And how do you plan to spread the truth?
Or do you recommend just giving up and doing nothing?

<p>
And the answer to your last question is, &quot;objective&quot;. Once again,
<a href="orange-letters272.html#results" target="_blank">read the doctors' reports</a>.
That is objective information.

</font>
<p>
Detach yourself emotionally from AA. Get some perspective.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have some perspective. I lived in the &quot;recovery community&quot; for several
years. I saw people dropping like flies.
I have seen just what a failure &quot;12-Step recovery&quot; really is.
</font>
<p>
As I've said before, I agree with the bulk of your information. It is
being given with a large dose of logical inconsistency and a serious
lack of objectivity, though.

<p>
It is hyperbole to typify AA as a cult. Dr. Stanton Peele, often
characterized as an AA-basher, doesn't call them a cult. He says the
lack of a rigid heirarchy of power precludes it from a being a cult.
My personal experience and my knowledge of AA supports that view.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Have you read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>?
Read that before declaring that A.A. is not a cult.
<p>
I very much like Dr. Stanton Peele. If he chooses to avoid talking about the
cultish nature of Alcoholics Anonymous, that is his choice. I think he wants to
concentration on the issue of treatment of alcoholics.
<p>
And no power structure? Get real. Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_authoritarian" target="_blank">Hierarchical, Authoritarian Power Structure, and Social Castes</a><br>
And then read about the A.A. sub-cult leaders like Clancy:<br>
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Stories about Clancy Imusland's <i>Pacific Group</i></a>
</font>
<p>
It's okay to be angry. However, you would have a an easier time giving
coherent advice if you could detach your anger from your analysis of
AA.

<p>
Again, I don't know why your tone is so hostile. If you would take the
time to read what I say, you would see that it is not a defense of AA.
It's a pragmatic attitude of allowing alcoholics to both choose a
therapy option they like and to engage in the same unhealthy,
irrational behavior that healthy people use. It's a moral argument,
not an empirical argument. Similarly, I have a neutral opinion about
acupuncture, holistic medicine, ostepathy, hypnosis, homeopathy etc.
Quack cures? Miracle cures? Read the literature &#8212;  it's complex and the
jury is still out on a couple of these.

<p>
<font color="blue">
My tone is so hostile because it is a despicable crime to foist quack medicine on very sick people
and lie to them about how well it works.
<p>
It is not a matter of &quot;allowing alcoholics to both choose a
therapy option they like&quot;. Every day, people are sentenced to the A.A. cult religion.
Look here for some examples:
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">Sentenced to A.A.</a>.
And every day, so-called &quot;treatment centers&quot; shove people into A.A. after taking their money with
promises of treatment.
<p>
Your last argument is an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape via Relativism</a>,
and also an appeal to antirationalism.
As in,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Have a neutral opinion. We don't know the whole truth &#8212; maybe quackery really works good after all.&quot;
</font>
Again, you are trying to slip in the suggestion that maybe A.A. really works after all. No, it doesn't.
We've already been through that. The empirical evidence clearly shows that A.A. is a monstrous failure
that just raises
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">the rate of binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the death rate</a>.
And A.A. raises
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">the cost of hospitalization</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">the rate of rearrests</a>.

</font>
<p>
Choosing a medical or psychiatric therapy is a complex subject; use
common sense and the advice of a qualified doctor. If a therapy seems
to work, think about sticking with it regardless of your natural
skepticism. Stay informed. Perhaps if the people coerced into
attending AA were warned of its inefficacy, it would have neutral or
beneficial impact.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds like good advice, except for the &quot;seems to work&quot; part. Again, you are opening the door
for deluded people to claim that they really like their favorite superstitions, and for
treatment center salesmen to sell more quack medicine.
<p>
And the suggestion that A.A. would have a &quot;beneficial impact&quot; if people were warned that it doesn't work
is illogical. Again, you are trying to surreptitiously slip in acceptance of A.A.
You keep saying that you aren't pro-A.A., and then you try to slip in promotion of A.A.
</font>
<p>
I give you my moderate and reasonable attitudes with trepidation,
because I am sure that I will soon learn that Adolf Hitler shared them
with me.

You responded: That doesn't make a lot of sense. An order of magnitude

<p>
An order of magnitude is the class of scale or magnitude of any
amount, where each class contains values of a fixed ratio to the class
preceding it. In its most common usage, the amount being scaled is 10
and the scale is the (base 10) exponent being applied to this amount
(therefore, to be an order of magnitude greater is to be 10 times as
large). Such differences in order of magnitude can be measured on the
logarithmic scale in &quot;decades&quot; (i.e. factors of ten).

Science does not have a model yet that shows how the physical

Show me one study that show how the firing of neurons directly

does not have the technology to say &quot;such and such neurons fire and it

There is no direct empirical evidence that thoughts exist except our

Baloney. The doctors' research is so advanced that just recently there were
stories on TV about doctors attaching electrodes to paraplegic and quadraplegic people's skulls,
and the people were able to control prosthetic machinery with their thoughts.
The doctors are way beyond wondering if there is a connection between thought and
neurons firing. The doctors' knowledge is so extensive that they know where on the brain to put the
electrodes so that the patient can think about moving a limb, and that causes motors to turn
and prosthetic arms and legs to move.
(The patients love it. The word &quot;empowering&quot; is appropriate.)

Now you just arguing that because some people use words like &quot;spirit&quot;
or &quot;soul&quot;, that such things are real. That is another logical fallacy.
It's called Reification.

<p>
We use lots of words and expressions for vague concepts. That does not
make those vague concepts and expressions into real things. I remember
Tracy Kidder's book <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>, which was the story of
two teams of whiz kids creating a new computer at Data General
Corporation. That book does not prove that computers have souls.<br>

<p>
I am arguing that words like &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;soul&quot; imperfectly capture
useful concepts for pragmatic discussion. I do not think that they are
necessarily real. If we are restricted to using words with only
extrinsic definitions, then you need to follow the same principle.
There is not a psychological consensus on what constitutes &quot;I&quot;, the
human sense of identity. What a strange word! It has a different
meaning depending on who utters it!

<p>
In compliance with your principle of clear and unambiguous speech, I
forthwith request that you remove that word from your website.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is another illogical argument.
I did not demand that you stop using words like spirit or soul. I just objected to

I have suffered a sickness of the spirit and soul. In empirical terms
I would describe it as: &quot;listlessness, lack of affect, despair, lack
of pleasure, lack of self-esteem, irrational guilt, anxiety, fear etc.
(even a clinical description uses vague words like despair and
anxiety)&quot; From the inside, sickness of the spirit seems like a more
accurate description.<br>
</font>

<p>
You were once again pushing an A.A. fallacy &#8212; the &quot;spiritual disease&quot; nonsense.
You were suffering from a psychiatric disorder &#8212; specifically, clinical depression
and anxiety &#8212; not a spiritual disease.
<p>
And no matter how real the pain feels, that does not make &quot;spiritual diseases&quot; real.
That is <a href="orange-propaganda.html#reification" target="_blank">the logical fallacy of reification</a>.
<p>
Furthermore, Alcoholics Anonymous is not qualified to treat psychiatric disorders. That is felony
practicing medicine without a license. But they do it. First, they try to redefine mental illness as a
&quot;spiritual disease&quot;, and then they claim that because they are members of a cult religion, that
they are qualified to treat &quot;spiritual diseases&quot;.  No, they aren't.

Hello again, Virgorich,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
And thanks for the compliments about the research.
<p>
You don't have to be brainwashed to join a cult. All that you have to do is walk into the
room. Becoming a &quot;true believer&quot; is another matter. You don't sound like you
drank the koolaid.

<p>
I've also contemplated
moving to a foreign country where the living is super-cheap, because I'm also on a V.A. retirement.
But so far, I like it here in Oregon, even though I'm paying ten times as much in rent as I would in Mexico
or the Philippines.
<p>
Yes, will has a lot to do with it. It's really hard to teach will power to somebody else,
but SMART has the goal of &quot;enhancing motivation&quot;, which strikes me as another way of saying,
&quot;increase will power.&quot;
Personally, I don't feel like I have a lot of will power. What I have is a very strong determination
to never be that sick that way again.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	New registration User name bloodorange, do I need to change the username?<br>

<p>
I just realized this may not have been the best name to register with because it
could be construed as violent.  I was using blood in the family/kin context.  I can
certainly change it if it's an issue.   My reasoning for selecting the name is that
I have have a number of relatives who are or who have been in AA.  Several of whom
use AA jargon/teaching to deflect their own responsibility for difficult
situations/relationships.   Also, I was trying to think of different types of orange
and that and Mandarin oranges are 2 of my favorites.  The relatives include my
brother, mother, father (deceased), grandfather and an aunt.  My brother and aunt
met their spouses in AA and my mom met my stepdad there.  For some people (dad,
grandfather) it's helpful, but I agree it's got the potential to be cultish and
there is nowhere near the accountability there should be for the power they try to
get over people's lives.  If I do need to change it, maybe Al-aNO?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anon Anon,
<p>
The name bloodorange is okay. When I saw the name, I thought of the fruit. I think there really is
a &quot;Blood Orange&quot;. The picture I get in my mind is an orange with red streaks in the fruit.
I'm pretty sure that I've eaten a few of them.

<p>
Sorry to hear about your relatives.
</font>
<p>
Also, I went for counseling after an estrangement from my mother/brother (long
story) and the counselor, while helpfully educating me about scapegoating, tried to
convince me I was an alcoholic.  I checked with another therapist and close friends
(the kind who are honest enough to say when an outfit isn't flattering or that I'm
out of line or wrong in a situation).  The consensus is WTF is he talking about?   I
was told I was in denial and my friends must be alcoholics too.
Among his evidence that I must be an alcoholic was that I cut back on
drinking after blacking out when I was in college (I'm now in my
mid 40s, college for me was back in the 1980s).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, isn't it outrageous how some excessive drinking more than 20 years ago suddenly makes you an alcoholic now?
I trust that you dumped that so-called &quot;counselor&quot;.
</font>
<p>
He also kept trying to get me to go to 12 step meetings from Al-Anon after I went to
the recommended number of meetings and said I didn't feel comfortable with it.  He
also dismissed concerns about the psychiatrist he referred me to discuss possible
medications with for anxiety.  Among other things, she left the door open during the
appointment without explaining why or asking if it was ok. Needless to say, I
changed therapists &amp; psychiatrists and I'm making better progress now in dealing
with my family issues &amp; anxiety.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Stepper counselors who are trying to recruit more members for their favorite cult religion are guilty
of a serious conflict of interest. The counselor is supposed to be caring for the patient, not
trying to sell his religion.
<p>
I'm sure that it was not a coincidence that the counselor referred you to a wierd psychiatrist.
<p>
That psychiatrist is creepy all right. Leaving the door open is a gross violation of medical confidentiality.
Medical confidentiality is supposed to be just as sacred as confessions to a Catholic Priest.
Leaving the door open also sounds like a subtle form of intimidation: &quot;Be careful of what you say,
people are listening.&quot; I'm glad that you changed psychiatrists.
<p>
In fact, I'd file complaints against both your counselor and psychiatrist
with whatever boards certify psychiatrists and counselors. I'm not sure who that is.
Perhaps readers can help there. Stepper counselors and psychiatrists who intimidate patients into following their
&quot;program&quot; should get their license to practice medicine cancelled.
One complaint alone won't do it, but many will. And if nobody ever files a complaint, then there will never
be &quot;many complaints&quot;.
</font>
<p>
One healthy thing I noticed about my current therapist is that he was neutral on the
topic of 12 step programs.  When I described some of the things about AlAnon which
made me uncomfortable, he said &quot;I get it, it's a little too summer camp, rah-rah for
you&quot; (not said sarcastically or argumentatively, that's his style/sense of humor).
He accepted I wasn't comfortable with it and didn't try to push me to go to
meetings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds good. I'm really glad to hear that you left the Stepper recruiters behind.
<p>
Oh, and it occurs to me that your new therapist will know where you can file complaints about your old
Stepper counselor and psychiatrist.

<p>
Have a good day now, and good luck.

Fair enough you managed to quit using drugs on your own will power, I tried that for
years and I could never stop, I was sniffing coke and telling myself at the same
time that I never wanted to do it. The 12 step program is the only thing that has
got me clean, a helped me stay sober for longer than a day. Also my dad has been in
the fellowship for 10 years and stayed sober and clean, when he couldn't get a day
without a substance. If you don't mind me asking, what have any of the fellowships
done to you? You obviously don't have the illness of addiction, and if you don't
think it's an illness look in the medical journal and you will find it listed, i
just don't understand why you would go to so much trouble to try and give something
a bad name when it saves people's lives like mine and my fathers.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Nick,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you finally quit your drug habit. Of course we are going to disagree about
the cause of your quitting. The simple facts of the matter are:

<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">Most people who go to 12-Step groups don't quit their addictions</a>. And also
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">see this</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Medical" target="_blank">Most people who quit their addictions don't go to 12-Step meetings</a>.
</ol>

<p>
What happened? Read these three items first:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">Intro to A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program" target="_blank">Bait-and-switch treatment</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing" target="_blank">Friends driven away from help by the 12-step nonsense</a>
</ol>
<p>
Then you can read the list of 12-Step horror stories,
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="_blank">here</a>, and I think
you will get the idea.
<p>
And if you want to see how other people have recovered, you could read this:

It's a shame that things like this can be posted on the internet that
reflect opinions and assumptions where possibly a first time struggling
alcoholic and or someone who's on the fence reads it, and there looking for
a way out of his or her misery and they don't realize there reading a blog
from someone that doesn't have enough knowledge or experience to know what
there talking about. I say this because someone with the disease of
alcoholism and knowledge of the program of alcoholics anonymous would not
post such mistruths about something as devastating to society as this
disease.

<p>
This is one of the downfalls of the internet, it does have its good sides
but has too many bad sides. Your blog can be the difference between life and
death when its just so apparent you just cant have the insight that the
twelve steps of AA brings to all whom do work all 12 steps AND CONTINUE TO
CARRY THE MESSAGE OF HOPE without being an alcoholic in recovery.

<p>
I'm so grateful I get to truly think about my actions today and how they
will affect others. (Sometimes not as well as others but I do the best I
can) Before it just didn't matter to me if I had all the pertinent
information or not, it made me feel good to express my opinions as long as
it made me feel good, even if I new down deep I didn't really have the whole
picture.

<p>
I was once told I just can't go into a house even with basic knowledge of
electrical and wire the entire house, finish the job including the breaker
box without direction from an experienced electrician whom has done it
before and has the knowledge and experience to do it correctly. In the long
run because of just the basics I could cause a fire which could affect
others, needless to say kill someone. We could go on at infinitum with these
types of examples.

<p>
There is absolutely no way anyone could understand HOW IT WORKS unless they
have had to struggle with the disease of alcoholism, just like I would NEVER
write something about how to get through cancer treatments without having
had to go through it myself??????

Hello Al,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I guess we are even:

I think it's appalling that confused and deluded people are allowed to sell their favorite old
cult religion from the nineteen-thirties as a quack cure for alcohol addiction.
But that's what happens when you have Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Speech in a country.
<p>
All of your major points are wrong.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">A.A. does not work to cure alcohol addiction</a>.
A.A. is not the only way, or even the best way. In fact,

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. is one of the worst ways to deal
with alcohol abuse</a>.

<p>
Warning people about toxic quack medicine that will hurt them is a good thing, not a bad thing.

Have a good day now.
