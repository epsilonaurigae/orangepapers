Hello again Orange!!  I only have one class this semester.... can you tell?

<p>
Your latest wisdom caught my eye.

<p>

I believe this is what Schaler identified as the &quot;Self Fulfilling
Prophecy. Here is an excerpt from a paper I wrote a few years  back. You probably
have his work archived.... in fact I may have found it there... but anyway it
is so very important to share, and I am glad you brought  it to our attention
once again.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Jeffrey Schaler's (1996) belief which states, &quot;Teaching that addiction is
a disease creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.&quot; In addition Schaler (1996)
writes, &quot;When you teach people that they are powerless, they will act in a
powerless way.&quot; The idea of admitting that one has no control over a
chemical substance which they ingest or put into their body can eventually lead
to feelings of helplessness. AA calls this powerlessness. AA immediately
releases an alcohol abuser of responsibility and self-control in the first
step of the Alcoholics Anonymous 12 Step Program.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The DEVIL made me do it... I am a sinner! I need  redemption!
<p>
I was not a teenager when I was thrown to the wolves in AA, but I was
close enough, I had just turned 22. I am going to be 49 in a month, I left AA a
little over 3 years ago. I would hope that just ONE teen or young adult
will read this letter.... to save them from the AA hell I lived for so
long....
<p>
It is truly amazing how the &quot;Self Fulfilling Prophecy&quot; works, especially
when it is introduced to the minds of vulnerable, scared and impressionable
young people.
<p>
Time to stop the madness!!
<p>
Thanks again Orange... you are a valuable source of inspiration AND
information!!

<h2>PRIMARY PURPOSE OF AA</h2>

Akron Beacon Journal (OH)-September 26, 2010
<p>
Last month, a good friend of mine went to his family doctor. The doctor
determined that he had an addiction and put him on medication.

<p>
The doctor said, &quot;You have an addiction and an addiction is an
addiction &#8212; they are all the same.&quot; He then recommended that my friend attend
alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

<p>
The judges, doctors, psychologists and other professionals who mean well
continue to send people with addictions unrelated to alcohol to the Fellowship
of Alcoholics Anonymous here in the Akron area.

<p>
For more than 30 years, here in the birthplace of AA, I have watched the
dilution of the fellowship before my eyes, to the point where AA has become the
world's largest lost and found and dumping ground for every affliction and
addiction.

<p>
We in AA have a common &quot;problem,&quot; not &quot;problems.&quot;

<p>
The program is to help alcoholics, only, as our Fifth Tradition clearly
states: &quot;Each group has but one primary purpose  &#8212;  to carry the message to the
alcoholic who still suffers.&quot;

<p>
Better do one thing supremely well than many badly.

<p>
Around it, our society gathers in unity &quot;for the alcoholic.&quot; The very
life of our fellowship requires the preservation of this principle (Twelve Steps
&amp; Twelve Traditions, page 150).

<p>
The book tells us: &quot;We of Alcoholics Anonymous could not be all things
to all men, nor should we try.&quot;

<p>
It says: &quot;Singleness of purpose, and our primary purpose, is to help
another alcoholic.&quot;

<p>
You do not hear this at any Akron-area meetings anymore. Alcoholic lives
are being lost.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Ctmjon,
<p>
Thanks for the article. I find that article interesting from several angles.
The author is assuming that A.A. works, or used to work. He thinks that watering down
A.A. with &quot;the wrong people&quot; is making alcoholics die.
<p>
I agree that alcoholics are dying, but it isn't because A.A. is less
effective now than it used to be. A.A. was never effective. The author
is perpetuating the myth that A.A. was great in the good old days, and
it is getting diluted now.

<p>
A.A. was just as much a failure in the &quot;good old days&quot; as it is now. I know that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="_blank">Bill Wilson bragged in the <i>Big Book</i>
about how great his miraculous new invention was</a>,
and how many alcoholics it was saving, but that was just Bill's bragging, backed up by
zero real facts or statistics or records.
And Bill Wilson actually told the opposite story at Dr. Bob's memorial service.
There, Bill bragged about what long-suffering saints he and Dr. Bob were,
and how hard they had to work to get Alcoholics Anonymous started:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><b>Bill Wilson</b>, at the memorial service for
Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;
file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson also bragged,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So whether A.A. was a fantastic success &#8212; the greatest spiritual
and medical discovery of the 20th Century,
or a dismal failure with a success rate that was close to zero,
depended on whether Bill Wilson wanted to brag about how brilliant
his invention was, or brag about how hard he had to work to save all
of those worthless alcoholics.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Ds S&quot;<br>
Subject:  	More Unpopular opinions<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,
<p>
I'm sorry my ideas stick in your craw.  I guess the point I'm really trying
to get across in my earlier letters about Tibet, but not very sucessfully is if
it is the public will of the Tibetan people for the return of the Dali Lama,
then by all means return him, but I don't see that I see people supporting the
Dali Lama on the basis that he is not Communist China.

<p>
You are correct their is no way to actually predict the future with absolute
certainty.  (The movie was called <i>The Minority Report</i>.  You are correct the
system did not work very well in the movie.  It worked a little bit better in
the short story by Phillip K. Dick.  By the way isn't that an example of arguing
by allegory)  Never the less you have try to make the best prediction you can
based on the available information.  I have found no indication one way or the
other in the Dali Lama's writing about how he intends to rule, for example
fiscal policy, healthcare, education, etc.  I also find no indication in his
writing that he intends to include the people in his government.  Thus based on
the available information that he will do none of these things.
<p>
As for the argument that I am an imperialist trying to enforce my way of
life on others, I would ask you why do you even have the Free Tibet banner.  You
see by the same logic you could say their is nothing wrong with the way China
treats Tibet, because well thats there culture, and we shouldn't try to enforce
our values on them.  Unfortunately the &quot;Not enforcing our values on other
people&quot;, can be used as an excuse for moral cowardice to let attrocities occur.
Consent of the governed is a basic value/morale/religious tennet call it what
you wish that is prerequisite for all governments.  Ofcourse on the opposite end
of the spectrum (as you noted) you have the problem of tyranny against soveriegn
nations.  So in balancing the values of respecting the soveriegnty of foreign
nations and consent of the governed I would argue that an unqualified support of
the Dali Lama is wrong, or at the very least not the optimum way t o free Tibet.
<p>
On the NPR issues.  First technically the F-35 joint strike fighter isn't
pork barrell spending.  Federal funding is being used on a federal military
platform that will be deployed through out the entire country and used to
enforce federal policy through out the world.  Pork barrell spending would be
like using federal funding to build a state highway or bridge.  Never the less
on the issue of funding the F-35 joint strike fighter your preaching to the
converted.  If we can't afford it and the boys in blue/green don't want it, then
we shouldn't buy it.  On the issue of corrupt politicians, you forgot to mention
recent supreme court rulings granting corporations the constitutional rights as
citizens, the ongoing issues with campaign finance reform, and how lobbyists can
unduly influence politicians.  Even as we speak I'm listening to a radio
broadcast about how the governor of Wisconsin wants to recind all collective
barganning power of teachers unions.  Then theres the deficit.  Then theres the
two wars still being waged, one of then started under at the very least
questionable pretences.  I don't think my countrys way of life is superior.  I'm
very aware that my country has serious issues, and its going to take a long time
to solve them.  They are all brillian reasons why we should fix our own
problems.  They are not reasons why I should support the Dali Lama, if I suspect
that he will become a totalitarian dictator.
<p>
Furthermore I'm also listening to NPR about the recent uprisings in Tunisia
and Egypt and about the current uprisings in Bahrain and Libya.  Now I don't
know what kind of governments are going to rise from the ashes.  More than
likely they will not be pro-American governments (due to the fact that we have
supported a great many monarchs and dicators in the Middle East all in the name
of &quot;Not enforcing our values on other people&quot;)  However these will be
governments that have the concent of the governed which is more than the Chinese
regime in Tibet can say, and more than the Dali Lama can say.
<p>
Just to shake things up I included a link that is actually about alcoholism
and addiction.  It is an argument by Stanton Peele asserting that &quot;The kind of
clear-cut model of the genetic sources of alcoholism perceived by the public and
presented in popular tracts does not accurately reflect the state of knowledge
in this area. No persuasive genetic mechanism has been proposed to account for
accumulated data about alcoholic behavior, social differences in alcoholism
rates or the unfolding of the disease. Biological findings about the offspring
of alcoholics have been inconsistent and grounds exist to challenge the notion
of an enhanced genetic liability for alcoholism that has been accepted wisdom
for the last decade. Genuine attempts to forge data and theory into genetic
models have been limited to men alcoholics and to a minority of severely
afflicted alcoholics with other special characteristics. However, several
investigators dispute the idea of a special type of inherited alcoholism
affecting only such groups. Even for these populations, balanced genetic models
leave room for the substantial impact of environmental, social and individual
factors (including personal values and intentions) so that drinking to excess
can only be predicted within a complex, multivariate framework. The denial of
this complexity in some quarters obscures what has been discovered through
genetically oriented research and has dangerous consequences for prevention and
treatment policies.'

Finally I hope my remarks did not upset you.  With few exceptions (such as
Tibet), I agree with the content of your website.  Additionally even if I didn't
my aim was for reasoned debate about differing opinions rather than acrimony.
Regardless of what you think of my opinions I hope we can accomplish that much.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, &quot;No one of any importance&quot;,
<p>
I'm not upset. To answer your points:

<ol>

<p><li>
Yes, I guess that is an example of arguing by allegory. Oh well, it worked for Jesus.

<p><li>
You keep on falling back on the line about how the Dalai Lama won't establish &quot;democracy&quot;
in Tibet, as if that would establish the virtue of the man.
At this point, arguing what the Dalai Lama might do or would do in his government is pretty
academic, considering that he doesn't have a government, and probably never will.
The odds are that he will die of old age before he ever sees Tibet again.
<p>
Then, the rumor is that, when the Dalai Lama dies,
 the Chinese authorities will pretend to find the next
reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, somebody of their choice.
I was just hearing that on a program about Tibet on Public Television.
I wish I could remember what the show was.
<p>
Are you aware of the fact that Tibet traditions and scriptures predicted that this Dalai Lama
would be the last one?

<p><li>
I don't think you are an imperialist. I just think your denunciation of the Dalai Lama
is unfair and not based on facts.

<p><li>
You keep complaining about that &quot;Free Tibet&quot; banner. You say that I should worry about
restoring human rights to Tibet, rather than actually freeing Tibet from China.
Odd, to say the least.


<p><li>
You said,
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 &quot;You
see by the same logic you could say their is nothing wrong with the way China
treats Tibet, because well thats there culture, and we shouldn't try to enforce
our values on them.&quot;
</font>
<p>
The big difference is that the Tibetan people like the Dalai Lama. They don't like the 
Chinese Army killing them and blowing up their monasteries. Surely you can see that difference.
<p>
Having a Dalai Lama <i>is</i> the Tibetan culture. Having the Chinese Army killing them is not
their culture, or their cherished traditions.

<p><li>
Your argument about the F-35 engine not being pork barrel spending is illogical.
Whether something is pork does not depend on whether it is Pentagon pork or state pork.
Even the Pentagon and Congress said that the F-35 engine
 was useless waste, and an odd-couple alliance of
Tea Party Congressmen and Democratic Congressmen just passed an amendment to kill it.
And it actually was state pork too: The Congressmen who wanted to continue the project,
like Rep. Boehner, have defense contractors' plants in their districts that make the parts,
so it's all about keeping local jobs.
You know the old saying about &quot;All politics is local.&quot;

<p><li>
Yes, there is a war going on in Wisconsin. What few people are talking about is the sequence of
events: First give a large tax break to the rich guys, which reduces the state's revenues.
Then cry that the state is going broke, there is a huge deficit, so we have to reduce the
teachers' salaries and bust their union. What a racket.
<p>
And did you catch the news that there is a clause in the
Wisconsin budget bill that allows the governor to sell the state's
electric generation plants to his rich cronies in a no-bid sale?
It's massive corruption, masked as &quot;privatization&quot;.<br>
See:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321211448/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/25/opinion/25krugman.html?emc=eta1" target="_blank">
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/25/opinion/25krugman.html?emc=eta1</a>

<p><li>
I am also watching the Middle East with interest. What a cascading blow-up. I also hope
that they get good government this time around, rather than
just another generation of criminals and dictators.

<p><li>
I like Stanton Peele, and agree with what he is saying.
There is no &quot;genetic disease of alcoholism&quot;.
Recent research, however, has found that there is a genetic factor to susceptibility to
having problems with alcohol. We were just talking about that recently:

<p>
<a name="Leu"> </a>
A researcher who found a gene for the tendency to abuse alcohol
 stated that there is evidence that
&quot;A Functional Neuropeptide Y Leu7Pro Polymorphism [is] Associated
With Alcohol Dependence in a Large Population Sample From the United
States&quot;. He explained it this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;This is only the second specific
genetic mechanism ever identified that modulates risk for alcohol
dependence.&quot;<br>
(See: <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>. 2002;59:825-831;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321211448/http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html">
http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html</a>)<br>
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I like that careful terminology:
<b><i>Modulates the risk for</i>, not <i>causes</i>, alcohol dependence.</b>
Having the gene increases your odds for having a problem with alcohol, but does not
<i>cause</i> you to drink, and it does not <i>make</i> you an alcoholic.

</ol>

Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Bill Wilson's many failings...<br>

<p>
Hello A. (Agent? Alan?) Orange
<p>
= Thanks to your research I have come away even more
amazed and in awe of the recovery program presented in both The Big Book and The
Twelve and Twelve. It's clear that Bill Wilson though highly intelligent and
charismatic was a deeply flawed human being who it appears didn't work a very solid
AA program. While it was definitely better for himself and anyone his life might
touch that he was no longer a raging drunk, the selfish, self-centered, self-seeking
behaviors you speak to are clearly nothing to emulate and caused much harm. No doubt
the depression that plagued him was mostly of his own making and his refusal to
consistently practice what he espoused. What amazes me is that a program such as AA
which has not only helped millions to stop drinking (not to mention the myriad
spin-offs that deal with drugs, food, sex, gambling, etc.) but to live more useful
lives was spawned by such a flawed human being. They ought to make a movie out of
that...oh, wait, as you said, they did. For those who sincerely practice this
program which as you probably know encourages rigorous self honesty, consistent self
searching of human failings, taking personal responsibility, confession to a trusted
person, asking for God's help, and then passing the program to others seeking relief
from their alcoholism, the quality of their lives change dramatically over time. I'm
sad that you see it as simply a cult. Best to you and hope where you reside, namely
the space between your ears, is mostly a good place to be...MM

<p>
P.S. I just wanted to mention that when I hit my knees, though grateful that Bill
Wilson helped to create this program, he is not to whom I pray.

Hello MS,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You have obviously chosen to believe whatever you wish to believe, no matter what the facts may be.

<p>
But I do have to correct one grossly wrong statement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
What amazes me is that a program such as AA
which has not only helped millions to stop drinking (not to mention the myriad
spin-offs that deal with drugs, food, sex, gambling, etc.) but to live more useful
lives was spawned by such a flawed human being.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no truth to that statement. Alcoholics Anonymous has not &quot;helped millions&quot; to stop
drinking. I know that the A.A. true believers won't stop repeating that lie, but it
is still a lie.
<p>
A.A. does not even have two million members worldwide, never mind two million sober.
The truth is, there are only a few hundred thousand hard-core
permanent A.A. members, and the rest is just churn. The churn is those people who come for a little while,
and don't like what they see, and leave. Then more come, or are sentenced by a judge, and
then they leave as soon as they can. Then more come, and don't like what they see, and then they leave.
You can read more about the A.A. churn rate
<a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is no good at sobering up alcoholics.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">The real A.A. cure rate is approximately zero</a>.
(Click on that link.)
<p>
Those few A.A. members who did quit drinking did so by using their own God-given will power, not by doing
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
the strange occult practices of Frank Buchman that are embodied in the 12 Steps</a>.
A.A. just steals the credit from a few people who were going to quit drinking anyway.

<p>
The 12 Steps are equally useless for
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">fixing problems with drugs, food, sex, gambling, or etc.</a>
<p>
There is nothing amazing about the fact that a mentally ill criminal like Bill Wilson was
able to foist such a fraud on sick people.
Con artists are a dime a dozen. And as P. T. Barnum said, &quot;There is a sucker born every minute.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day.

Hello Jack,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety.
<p>
And thanks for a great question. The answer is, &quot;The best alternative to going to A.A. meetings
is to quit drinking.&quot;
<p>
That is not a flippant answer. Most of the people who go to A.A. meetings do not quit drinking.
They go to A.A. meetings, for months or years, but they don't quit drinking.
A much better alternative is to quit drinking and not go to A.A. meetings.
(And that is the path that I have followed for the last 10 years.)
<p>
Now if you really want a meeting or a formal organization, there are several alternatives
like SMART, SOS, Lifering, or WFS. And there are a variety of techniques that may help
someone. I discussed all of that a little while ago here:

<p>
Wow!  You definitely hit the nail on the head!  I had some really
creepy times at AA and a boarding school I was forced to go to as a
teen (A Synanon offspring) called CEDU.  I could write a book about
that place.  Went to AA for awhile last year, had a creepy obsessive
sponsor who &#8212; Wow &#8212; if he's the model for AA then count me out! Also
had a very AA devout aunt who ended up losing her life to a Methadone
overdose in her late forties.  I truly believe she became so obsessed
with her &quot;disease&quot; that it ended up consuming her every thought and
led her back to drink/drugs.  What a waste.

<p>
The morning after the last time I went out drinking my best friend &#8212; 
also a hardcore AA member &#8212; said to me &quot;you have a belly full of booze
and head full of AA.&quot;  I thought, yup, you're right.  Now let's get
rid of both.  So I did.  I quit drinking on my own.  I began running,
enjoying my life, joining normal activity groups, bought a car, and I
am finally working my way through grad school.  I definitely can't
drink.  I can go out and get a problem again real quick, but I don't.
I use my common sense and the coping skills that I have had since I
was child to get through the rough times.  So far it has worked great
for me.  Yes, most AA'ers at this point would be super quick to remind
me of the story in the BB about the successful man who quit on his own
will only to drink many years later and was dead in a month.
Whatever...  That can happen to someone in AA as well.  One can get
hit by a car tomorrow, or god-forbid get diagnosed with cancer.

<p>
Anyway, very interesting reading.

Orange,
<p>
Thanks for writing back the last time I contacted you. I've been sober
almost three years now and haven't been to a meeting in over two months.
Once I realized that I was the one deserving the credit for my sobriety, not
AA and those ridiculous steps (which I never did), the need for a meeting
seemed entirely unnecessary. And you know what?  I don't have any desire to
drink, have not ended up in an institution and am not dead! Amazing!
<p>
Oh, and my sponsor? The one who cared so deeply about me staying
sober....Haven't heard a word from him since I quit the meetings. I'd love
to tell him that I've never been more &quot;happy, joyous and free,&quot; but he would
just tell me I couldn't have been a real alcoholic.
<p>
I now participate in my own program, and I work it very well. It's called,
&quot;No steps, no traditions, just don't drink.&quot; I highly recommend it.
<p>
For a long time I have felt a real connection to the following quote and now
that I have dropped out of AA, I appreciate it even more and would like to
share it with you:

<p>

<blockquote>

Isn't it just so revealing

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">


CBS and Warner Bros. Television have pulled the plug on the rest of Two and a Half
Men's season after series star Charlie Sheen's shocking radio rant on Thursday.

<p>
&quot;Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition, CBS and
Warner Bros. Television have decided to discontinue production of Two and a Half Men
for the remainder of the season,&quot; reads the statement.

<p>
It's about time.

<p>
Sheen's personal life has made headlines numerous times, from his marital problems
to various substance abuse issues. This isn't the first time production on Two and a
Half Men has been halted because of him. The first time was in 2010, when the actor
entered a rehab facility; then again on Jan. 27, 2011, following his hospitalization
(for alleged &quot;severe abdominal pains&quot;) and another stint in rehab.

<p>
Things got a whole lot worse after Sheen sent an open letter to TMZ, responding to
Men's suspension, and unleashed a verbal assault against Sheen's boss, Men creator
Chuck Lorre. Sheen kept referring to Lorre by his &quot;real name Chaim Levine,&quot; and it
only went downhill from there.

<p>
In what is likely the boldest, harshest statement made by a series star about their
showrunner, Sheen unloaded:

<p>
&quot;I violently hate Chaim Levine. He's a stupid, stupid little man and a p---- punk
that I'd never want to be like. That's me being polite. That piece of s--- took
money out of my pocket, my family's pocket, and, most importantly, my second family
 &#8212; my crew's pocket ... You can tell him one thing.  I own him.&quot; Sheen then
challenged Lorre to a figurative duel: &quot;If he wins, then he can leave my show.&quot;

<p>
His TMZ tirade comes after Sheen called into a syndicated radio show on Thursday,
opening his mouth and unleashing a stunning tongue-lashing, attacking his hit show
as well as Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
&quot;I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, and so
I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not,&quot; Sheen told the host of
The Alex Jones Show, referring to his bosses at CBS.

<p>
&quot;Are they happy with the $5 billion they already made off me or do they think they
can turn it into $10 [billion] in a couple more seasons?&quot; Charlie continued. &quot;I'm
just saying, you know [the show] is a runaway freakin' juggernaut.&quot;

<p>
Sheen made it clear that the show would fail miserably without him, citing the
ratings decline the sitcom has seen in recent weeks, since he became tabloid fodder.

<p>
&quot;Watch your ratings, dudes. Watch your stupid ratings,&quot; he ranted, before
threatening, &quot;Do what you've gotta do; I'll go make movies with superstars and not
work with idiots.&quot;

<p>
Charming.

<p>
The problematic actor also targeted Alcoholics Anonymous during his interview with
Jones, calling the organization a &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;a bunch of losers,&quot; and claiming it
has been &quot;brainwashing his family.&quot;

<p>
Riiiiight.

<p>
&quot;I don't know enough about what I call the 'Church of the Martian Idiots' truly to
comment on what they profess to believe in. I always thought of [it] as like a
really complicated long joke with no good punchline ... 22 years around those
impressive clowns and losers &#8212; I just, you know, finally extracted myself from their
troll hole and started living my life the way I want to live it because AA does not
teach you how to live your life the way you want to live it.

<p>
&quot;[AA] is vintage, it's outdated, it's stupid and it's worshipped by stupid people,
and it is their fault,&quot; he continued, before adding, &quot;They suffocated my soul, they
hijacked my brain, they brainwashed my friends and my family. Now I hate them
violently and I will use every soldier in my army to defend myself against them,
'cause they will come at me. They will come at me with all of their doctors, and
their talking heads and all their other freakin' loser clowns.&quot;

A spokesperson for Alcoholics Anonymous responded to Sheen's comments in a statement
to Access Hollywood, saying, &quot;People have a right to their opinions. We've been
around for 75 years and have helped millions of people obtain sobriety. There are
many paths to sobriety, sometimes through spirituality, through medication, through
therapy, a lot of different ways. We just know that AA has worked for millions of
people. We are not a cult, but we are a powerful movement.&quot;

<p>
The feud has been growing for a while now. Last week, Lorre took aim at Sheen with
one of his infamous vanity cards.

<p>
But since that only added fuel to the fire, Lorre decided to &quot;take a break for a few
weeks&quot; from writing his post-episode thoughts, reports Entertainment Weekly.

<p>
Instead, Lorre announced on Monday (following an episode of one of his other shows,
Mike &amp; Molly), that he would &quot;display a photograph of a part of my body that is
entirely innocuous. No longer will I share some troublesome piece of my mind. Now I
will share an actual piece of Chuck that is incapable of offending anyone.&quot; Lorre
included a picture of his elbow.

<p>
And Lorre stuck to his word. After last night's episode of The Big Bang Theory,
which he also created, Lorre's vanity card had the same message, except this time,
it featured an image of his knuckle.

<p>
Lorre claimed the break was needed, after his musings were &quot;getting scrutinized and
criticized&quot; by everyone from network executives to journalists and &quot;it's gotten out
of hand.&quot;

<p>
Sheen, and the rest of the cast and crew, planned to return to his show when
production was originally supposed to resume on March 1, but clearly that's not
happening. Hmmm, wonder who he's going to rant to next .

Hello Ian,
<p>
Thanks for the information. Yes, that is such a sad case, isn't it?
I hate to see people self-destructing, no matter whether it's Mel Gibson, or Lindsay Lohan,
or David Hasselhoff, or Glen Campbell, or Nick Nolte, or whomever.
<p>
There but for the grace of God go I.

<p>
It is still not clear if Sheen was drunk or stoned or neither when
he went on that rant. There is a lot of debate
going on about maybe he is bipolar and was off of his meds, or
maybe he overdosed on benzodiazepine meds, or
maybe he is suffering from serious brain damage from too many years of too many drugs.
Us outsiders have little chance of accurately diagnosing him without some more evidence.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Question on your article regarding AA<br>

<p>
Dear Mr/Ms &quot;Orange,&quot;

<p>
Would it be possible for you to post the comments you have received thus far to your
article on your analysis of the data supporting the AA 12 step program.  I then went
to your website and although you state you have received many email messages
questioning or rebutting your review, you do not have these comments posted?  I am
requesting that you do so, since my questions are probably the same as the others
you have already received.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kim,
<p>
Thanks for the questions. I post almost all critical letters that I receive.
Start with the first file of letters, <a href="orange-letters.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
You will very soon find letters that criticize me and tell me to read the <i>Big Book</i>
and find out what it's all about, and on and on.
And then there are 224 more files of letters following that first one, and
just about every one of those files of letters contains angry letters that
criticize me and call me a sack of motherfuckers, and declare that I am killing
alcoholics by telling the truth, and things like that.

</font>
<p>
I have major concerns regarding you inappropriate and down right WRONG
interpretation of pharmaceutical clinical studies.  Your ignorance with regard to
how clinical trials are conducted and data interpreted is so ignorant it makes we
question every other conclusion in your &quot;analysis.&quot;  I know there is a lot of trash
on the internet and maybe I should just ignore your website and this article all
together.  However, we do have an alcoholic in our family and we are encouraging
this person to get help and use the tools available- including AA.  Assuming I agree
with your conclusions (which I do not) here is my question to you, MR/MS ORANGE:  If
your family member was an alcoholic- what would you do?  Hope this person is among
the 5% that &quot;spontaneously&quot; recover?  Or encourage that individual to seek out all
help available?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I do not &quot;interpret&quot;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">clinical studies of the
effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
I simply state the facts that doctors found.  You are trying to use the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>
to turn the debate into an argument that is merely one opinion versus another, or
one &quot;interpretation&quot; versus another.
<p>
It is not a matter of interpretations. It is a matter of doctors doing controlled studies
and then stating what the results were. My opinion has no part in it. Facts are facts, and
death rates are death rates.
<p>
Actually, you are the one who shows no evidence of understanding how clinical tests and controlled
studies are conducted. You wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have major concerns regarding you inappropriate and down right WRONG
interpretation of pharmaceutical clinical studies. 
Your ignorance with regard to
how clinical trials are conducted and data interpreted is so ignorant it makes we
question every other conclusion in your &quot;analysis.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tests of the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous treatment are not tests of
pharmaceuticals. Did you just throw that word in there to try to make your rap sound more
impressive?
<p>
Furthermore, it isn't me who interprets the data, it is the doctor who conducted the test
and wrote the report. Like when
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant wrote that the A.A. death rate was &quot;appalling&quot;</a>,
that was his interpretation of the data, not mine.
<p>
You don't really know anything about clinical tests, do you? Go read this description
of how a doctor or scientist or researcher conducts a
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</a>.
<p>
If I had an alcoholic in my family (besides myself), I would recommend that he go to SMART meetings,
and Lifering and SOS if they were in the area. I would also recommend that he read the book
<i>Rational Recovery</i>, and also read a whole bunch of the other books on the 
<a href="orange-top10.html" target="_blank">Top 10 reading list</a>. I would also certainly
tell him about all of the suffering that alcohol caused me.
And I would point him to the lists of links where we discussed what works, and what has
helped people,
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>.
<p>
I would not recommend that any sick alcoholics or drug addicts go join
a cult religion that claims to have a great cure for drug and alcohol
problems, but that actually fails to help them. That includes Alcoholics
Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Scientology, and Synanon, and Jim Jones's People's Temple
(you know, where they drank the koolaid).

</font>
<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
I don't know how you can live with yourself for writing such an incredibly bias and
dangerous article.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And there it is again &#8212; the standard A.A. put-down:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Telling the truth about A.A. is doing a great disservice to alcoholics
who are seeking sobriety.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin42">
I have a long list of A.A. parrots who keep repeating that attack</a>.
Welcome to the list.
</font>
<p>
Warmly,

<p>
Dr. Kim S.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Doctor? Doctor of what? Obviously not medicine. Real doctors know how to read
the results of controlled studies and clinical tests.
And real doctors know the difference between Alcoholics Anonymous and a
pharmaceutical.

Have a good day.

Happy to be in the list with other the rational people.

Uh, Kim,
<p>
That list is not a list of rational people. There is nothing rational about
claiming that we should not tell the truth to sick people.
<p>
In fact, it is illegal to not tell the truth about suggested treatments for deadly
diseases or disorders or conditions. Doctors are required by law to do &quot;full disclosure&quot;,
accurately informing the patient about the success rate of any suggested treatment,
and the odds of survivial, and the death rate, and any possible complications &#8212; everything.
The good, the bad, and the ugly. Everything. So that the patient can then
make an informed choice.
Since you are claiming the title of &quot;Dr.&quot;, you should know that.

<p>
Have a good day now.
