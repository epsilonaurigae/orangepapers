Subject:  	Spiritual direction in addiction treatment<br>

<p>
I recently came upon and read with great interest your &quot;pages regarding
alcoholism treatment. I will provide only a brief outline my own story here,
as it is the same as those of many other alcoholics &#8212; I became depressed,
alcohol dependant, pathetic &amp; self-indulgent (etc.), and then within a few
years the physical effects of became life-threatening so I quit... &#8212; but
that is not why i am writing you today.

<p>
I am a public health researcher in New Mexico. The University of New Mexico
is home to William R. Miller, a scientist whose life work has been alcohol
studies, and more particularly, the role of spirituality in &quot;alcoholism&quot;
treatment. I wanted to call your attention to a paper that we recently
published which found *no effect* for spiritual intervention in a large
randomized clinical trial:

Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Thank you very much for the tip about this new research. As you correctly surmised, I'm always looking for
good new research on alcoholism treatment.  I'll have to get over to the local medical university library
and get a copy of that report.
<p>
It's a small world, you know. I used to live on the UNM campus. I mean literally <i>ON</i> the campus. I had one of
the last privately-owned houses that was entirely encircled by UNM property. You know the northwest parking lot
by the chapel? The northwest corner of that parking lot is where my house was. UNM bought the house out from under me
and put it on a truck and carted it down the street.  Yes, it's just like Joni Mitchell sang, &quot;They paved paradise and
put up a parking lot.&quot;  If I remember correctly, it was 612 University NW.

<p>
I used to play roller hockey on that bricked patio in front of the library. That was a real kick. Heck, I used to skate
everywhere. I'd just go out my back door, with skates on, and walk across the parking lot, and get onto that sidewalk
by the chapel, and then I could skate all over the campus.
<p>
Okay, enough of a trip down memory lane. That was about 25 years ago. Funny how time flies when you are goofing off.
<p>
Thanks again for the notification about the research. I've quoted William Miller and his publications in several
places on my web site, and I'll be quoting him some more.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	AA as Religion<br>

<p>
I found your articles on AA as Religion to be entertaining, amusing, and
most importantly informative. I learned many things about the AA fellowship
which I had always suspected: they are a religious organization, and not a
spiritual one.

<p>
Many people lump Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and AA in the same group. It is my
experience that they are most definitely 2 distinct organizations, and while
there are many paarallels (steps, traditions, etc...), NA seems to have a
much different,
non-religious feeling to it.

<p>
I was wondering what your experience with NA is (if any) and your feelings
about it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ritch,
<p>
I also found Narcotics Anonymous to be slightly less overtly religious,
but only slightly. But it was still just as irrational.
In fact, it was at an N.A. meeting that I finally recognized the constant unspoken appeals to stop
thinking and just become a true believer. Speaker after speaker would yammer on and on about how
wonderful his sponsor was, and how things really started working right when he quit questioning the
program and just did as he was told. The speakers constantly subtley exhorted the audience to
just get a sponsor and start happily proclaiming that &quot;It works.
It really does. It works if you work it! Keep coming back!&quot;
<p>
I was tempted, I was really tempted, to just give up and become a true believer. But I
realized that I couldn't really do that.
That moment was pretty much the end of any possibility of taking the A.A./N.A. program seriously.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
You are an idiot who knows absolutely nothing of what you speak! The AA program DOES
work if you work an honest program. I suspect you didn't get what you were looking
for because you couldn't be honest. If you really listen to what is said in the
rooms of AA, things start to make sense. AA people are the bravest, most spiritual
people I have ever been around. THey help each other and stay sober because of it.
THere is a true fellowship and bond between the people in those rooms.
<p>
As I said before, You know nothing of what you speak. That many people can't be wrong!

Hello Diann,

That is just a stream of

&quot;You aren't honest. You don't know. If you would just

It's all been said before &#8212; many, many, times over.
<p>
Lastly, when you say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;That many people can't be wrong!&quot;</font>,
you are showing that you know nothing about history.
That many people have been wrong countless times. Would you care to guess how many people once believed that
the world was flat? How many people and priests believed that girls were witches who should get burned at the stake?
How many believed that the cure for insanity is to suspend the patient in a snake pit?
And recently, how many believed that Jews deserve to be exterminated in concentration camps?
<p>
Millions of people believed those things.
<p>
And how many believers in Scientology and the Moonies are there right now?

<p>
First thank you for answering.I've been through  a terrible loss my home
burned down and there was very little insurance on it. I  don't care about anything
much else right now.As for AA &#8212; there's a*holes there  and there's wonderfuls
there &#8212; and I am still sober. I can't give you proof, hwat  I mean is that those
already unsure, or having gone to one meeting that didn't  work for them read
your words and actually believe AA is a cult or worse. If  someone, maybe
someones even, odn't want AA &#8212; fine. Let them decide for  themseves. I don't care to
sell it.
<p>
But neither should you keep pushing your opinion  imo.There *are* no real
clinical samples of who is sober in AA or  not.  I was in the businss of
counseling and I worked in homeless  shelters with sunstance abusers and the
statistics there arey one thing &#8212;  but  there's no way we can say who is going to &quot;make
it&quot; or not. I'm talking  about AA or any form of recovery.
For heavens sake how is AA killing  anyone?
<p>
It worked real well for me, &#8212; I do know those who  have left &#8212; one who thinks
he is'nt an alcoholic &#8212; that's  fine.     Most  that I know personally don't
continue  with the work and  a spiritual  approach, facing  themselves etc.,
after several yrs and get discouraged  wiht life so while  they may not be
drinking or using drugs &#8212; their attitude sucks.   But again &#8212; that's *their*  business.
<p>
Ther's no more I have to say. I was angry when I  wrote what I did because you
sounded like all you talked about was anti-this and  anti-that  &#8212; like
cultures who discuss what terrible folks we are here in the  West. But what do they
believe for themselves aside from hating the USA or  Europe?
<p>
I apologize for
calling you a jerk. I tried to tell you what I knew &#8212; not  rhetoric &#8212; what I know and
all you said was the same thing. But I'm sorry I said  that.
<p>
I  really don't see why you bothered  with all your hateful words.I really
don't.
<p>

Hello again, Persephone,
<p>
Sorry to hear about your house burning down.
<p>
The single most important question that I see in your letter is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;For heavens sake how is AA killing  anyone?&quot;
</font>
<p>
Well, the answer is:
<ol>
<p><li>
Telling people not to take their doctor-prescribed medications.
This is a quick killer. A.A., N.A., Al-Anon, and Dual Recovery Anonymous are all guilty of telling people not
to take their medications. When the medications are psychiatric medications, people are often in the hospital or dead
within two weeks.

<p><li> Telling people that they are powerless over alcohol (or powerless over drugs, or whatever). Why bother to
try to quit if you can't do it because you are powerless?  And why try to resist temptation and avoid a relapse when
you can't possibly win?

<p><li> Telling people that they are sinful and weak and disgusting and selfish, etc. Years of Fourth and Fifth
Steps are enough to
cause serious depression and drive people to suicide.

<p><li>
Telling people that they cannot ever recover. Again, it's enough to drive people to suicide.

<p><li>
Giving people a bogus program that does not work, and lying to them and telling them that it works great and
it's their own fault that it doesn't seem to be working.
Again, it's enough to make people despair of their lives, or give up on recovery.

<p><li>
Giving people a mess of misinformation about alcoholism and addiction
that actually makes recovery harder and less likely, like telling people
that the reason why they drink is because they have &quot;character defects&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;.
<p><li>
Teaching people to expect a &quot;Higher Power&quot; to magically remove the desire for drink,
without any thought or effort on their part, and to take care of their
wills and their lives for them.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Old sponsors thirteenth-Stepping the cute young women and girls</a>

Hi There, Have been reading with great interest the things you have to say about AA.
I have had 16 years of continous sobriety, and have attended AA on and off for much
of that time. It may seem strange to you that an atheist that doesn't believe in the
disease concept of alcoholism would find AA helpful.... but I have. I guess I have
always found ways to use what I wanted, and disregard the rest. Personally, I always
interpreted the steps (not that I ever really got into them) in a metaphorical way,
and saw them as being all about accepting responsibility for ones actions.
<p>
Apparently not everyone sees it this way! But I also was blissfully unaware of what
I am now reading about Bill Wilson, and the bad experiences that some people have
had with AA. To say that it is off putting is an understatement. Anyway, I would
enjoy discussing all this in a friendly way with anyone that is interested.
<p>
Thanks,Rick

Hi Orange! I just wanted to thank you for  setting me free. I  stumbled
across your work back in the summer of 2007.... my life has never been  better, or
the same

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I was a Big Book Banger, Super Sponsor, Wanna be Circuit Speaker,  Service
Working.... AA Nazi!

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>
<a name="Clancy"> </a>
I was recruited into the cult back in 1984..... In 1997 I found a  Clancy
Imislund (California, Homeless Shelter dude) clone who took me under  her wing and
turned me into an AA robot. I spent almost 10 years polluting the  minds of
newcomers and having my own brain twisted into knots.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

For some reason in the summer of 07' I had a &quot;spiritual  awakening&quot;..... not
that kind, the real kind, my eyes were opened! I had  been questioning myself
for a few years about AA tactics. Maybe it was the fact  that I had just
recently told a sponsee that it was time for HER to look at HER  part in the child
abuse she had been a victim of when she was 11. Maybe it was  my sponsors
advice that graduate school would NOT be a good idea.... that it  would distract me
from AA, (at this point I had been sober many years.) Maybe it  was my sick
aspiration to become a circuit speaker (like Clancy himself) that  got me to
question my sanity, and what I was doing with my life.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I typed in the words anti-AA....found your site and it changed  my life.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I cut off ALL contact with AA.... BUT they tried to get me  back,through
intimidation tactics and fear. They called my husband, came to my  front door in
groups, sent me e-mails,phoned me.... they were relentless. I  kept running
into them in the neighborhood stores where they would come up and  give me
unsolicited hugs.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

This went on for months.... I took matters into my own hands and  eventually
the harassment stopped. This &quot;pursuit&quot; of me was unbelievable and was  further
proof that AA was indeed a cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Today if I see &quot;one of them&quot; I walk right past as if I never  knew them. I
sent them all mass e-mails with your site attached. I stopped  answering the
phone, and I blocked my e-mail. They are gone now....but it took  major effort on
my part.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I believe AA is a dangerous cult. I am in Graduate school now..... I  was
going to go into teaching (Library)..... but have since changed my mind. I am
working on a masters degree in Community Counseling, and am already  encountering
the 12 step mobsters. Hopefully I will not get kicked out of  school. I have
one Professor who is sympathetic to my cause, but told me work in  the field
will probably be hard to come by due to my anti 12 step stance. I  don't believe
that.... I think the world is beginning to hear the truth. I want  to be one of
the Truth Spreaders.... like you, I saw too many die while in the  clutches of
AA

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

We will prevail..... and yes unfortunately, I  was one of  those who thought
Bill Wilson was inspired by God.

<p>

You make a lot of sense. But you have underestimated the sickness that one finds
in the &quot;rooms&quot; of AA.

Hi Gerald,
<p>
Thanks for the note. I wonder about that. I think I've pretty much seen the whole range of sickness &#8212; both
in the rooms, and in life.
(And what really bothers me is not the sick people in the A.A. meeting rooms &#8212; it's the sick people in positions of power
 &#8212; economic power and political power. Want another unnecessary war, anyone?)
<p>
I get the impression that you think that many of the people in A.A. are too sick to recover on their own.
That may well be true.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Medical School gave us a rule of thumb</a>
that says that almost 50% of the alcoholics don't break free.
They stay with their addictions until their addictions kill them.
The thing is, A.A. doesn't save them either. Those unfortunate sick people
will self-destruct in A.A. or out of A.A., just the same.  A.A. is useless.
It would be nice if somebody came up with a panacea that will save them all, but nobody has done it yet.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

2. Dependence and guidance from a Higher Power<br>
Did they, in fact, use 'Higher Power' back then?  I thought that they used
&quot;god&quot; for sometime and it was changed much later.

Hi Doug,
<p>
Quite correct. Bill Wilson originally used only the word &quot;God&quot; in the 12 Steps, the same as the Oxford Group
slogans.
There wasn't any &quot;Higher Power&quot; or &quot;As we understood Him&quot;
language in the original version of the Steps. It was all just &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Him&quot;.
<p>
Likewise, Step 7 originally read,
&quot;Humbly, on our knees, asked Him to remove our shortcomings &#8212; holding nothing back&quot;
<p>
Wilson changed the wording because atheists like Jim Burwell complained
about the fundamentalist sound of the 12 Steps, and said that the
Steps would drive away many of the alcoholics whom they hoped to help.

Anyway, I want to tell

'program', but I never felt right about any of it.  Your Site brought my
feelings and thoughts about AA/NA into focus and helped wipe clean the
brainwashing that had been occurring.  I was wondering about others who've
gone through the same thing.  Is there a Site, or Board out there where I

The Orange Papers is one of the best books I have ever read, you really should
publish it as a book and then work the media storm to change the way people think
about AA forever. The Orange Papers rescued me from the dark tunnel my life had
become in AA.......

You need to publish The Orange Papers because every day, more and more people are
sentenced to AA where many of them are mindfucked into in life of endless AA
meetings.....

Hi Orange

<p>
I recently returned to AA meetings after about a 3 year absense. The group that I am
attending is going through a group inventory. It was my suggestion about 4 years or
so ago that the group have an inventory which it did and shortly after that I
stopped attending. The group is following a format found on the jaywalker site.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222316/http://www.jaywalker.com/" target="_blank">www.jaywalker.com</a>
<p>
Anyway when the question about AA's turnover rate came up I spoke my mind and it
upset people. I seem to be at odds with a couple of members who think that the
original AA was highly successful (I think that the AA big Book claims 75%) but
personally I don't think that that can in anyway be proven, and that AA has NEVER
had a higher success rate than 5%. Just my opinion.

<p>
If you had any evidence that could state the so-called success of early AA I would
very much appreciate any feedback that you could give me, it is because of this type
of deception why I left AA and I think I will leave it again.

<p>

Thank you for &quot;saying&quot; what I have been trying to say for 30 years!

<p>
My parents sobered up with AA in the mid '70's.  It only took them about 2 years to
realize that they did not need the AA bull@@@@ to stay sober.  They both died (God
rest their souls), sober... 30 years later.  My soon to be ex-husband, (STBE), has
been sober through AA since 1988.  That is  a good thing... the sober part... the AA
part is what has ultimately broken us up.  I am a staunch believer that Bill Wilson
was  a hypocrit and snake-oil salesman... and have been for over 25 years.  I have
seen far too many 13th step issues, and heard tales from my parents and friends, to
not believe that this thing is a farce.  If it keeps you sober... great.  It will
not, however, make you sane or morally honorable.  Your section in the Orange Papers
about &quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">To The Wives</a>&quot; tells it all.

<font color="blue">
Hi Eric,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thank you for the compliments.<br>
Yes, I quit smoking. I don't want to discourage you, but it took me about 30 years.<br>
I'll bet that you can do it much sooner than that.<br>

<p>
I didn't finally quit and stay quit (8 years now) until I got really sick with about 5 kinds of colds and flus, one
after the other, for 6 weeks straight, non-stop sick, and I also got bronchitis which then turned into
pneumonia.  But I finally did quit.
<p>
I used the patch this last time around.
I was in the funny situation where I was saving up my one ticket to freedom.  That is, the Oregon Health
Plan, which I was on, had a rule that they would buy the patches for you once and only once. So my doctor said,
&quot;Don't get them now. Wait until you are 100% sure you are ready to do it for real, because you only get
one chance.&quot;
<p>
Things worked out in a funny way. After quitting drinking, I didn't get healthy. I got sick, extremely sick.
It was like <i>*everything*</i> caught up with me at once.
<p>
Three weeks after I quit drinking, I was so sick from colds, flus, and bronchitis that I couldn't even smoke a cigarette.
One puff and I would go into a 5-minute coughing fit and the cigarette would go out. I'd relight the cigarette
and try to take another hit off of it, and I'd go into another 5-minute coughing fit, and the cigarette would go out
again. After half an hour of that, I still hadn't smoked the cigarette and I was still having a nicotine
fit. At that point I said, &quot;This is hopeless.  Might as well quit.&quot;
So I went to the doctor and said, &quot;Okay, I'm ready. Let's do it now.&quot;
And I got the patches and the rest is history.
<p>
Now the patches won't make you quit. You have to be totally ready and determined to
quit. The patch just splits the withdrawal into two halves, which
are a lot easier to manage than going cold turkey all at once.
I don't mind going through withdrawal, but the withdrawal from cigarettes would literally drive me crazy.
Splitting the withdrawal into two halves, and doing one half at a time, made it much more manageable. And that's all I asked for.
That's all I needed.
<p>
<ol>
<li> First, when you start using the patches, and <i>don't smoke cigarettes</i>, you detox from all of the strange things that
are in cigarettes besides the nicotine.  And there's a lot of poisonous addictive chemicals in there.<br>
I went through incredible physical changes in the first
3 days off of cigarettes. Part of the time it was like I was tripping (on psychedelics).<br>
Then my skin turned pink. I mean so pink that it looked really strange. Well, strange to me, because I was accustomed to
my skin looking gray.  I turned so pink that a friend asked me if I had noticed the change in my complexion.<br>
I said, &quot;No.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Better go look in the mirror.&quot;<br>
I did, and was shocked by the strange color of the fellow in the mirror. My face was pink, my hands were pink, and when
I opened my shirt, my chest was pink. That was a color I had not seen in many years.
I looked like I was alive, not like a cadaver.
<p>
<li> Then, in the second phase, you cut down on the nicotine by using
weaker and weaker patches until you are getting nothing.
</ol>
<p>
The doctors imagined that I would be on the patches for about 2 months. But I cut to the end fast.
I really wanted to get detoxed and healthy as soon as possible.  I was only on the
21 milligram patches for a few days before I noticed that I was getting a foul metallic taste in my mouth, which
was a nicotine overdose. So I switched down to the 14 milligram patches, and then, after a week or so,
down to the 7 milligram ones, and then just stopped using them. I was only on them for about 2 weeks altogether.
And I was free.
<p>
Well, physically free. And then the mind games started.  That little voice in my head, the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>,
would start yammering about how much fun it was to smoke, and what a good time
we could have by hanging out and laughing and joking and smoking with the boys.
<p>
And,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, we've got it under control now. A whole month without a cigarette.
We've got it licked. We can relax and just have one now...&quot;
</font>

<p>
Fortunately, I had been through the routine enough times that this time around I wasn't fooled again.
This time, finally, I was able to see through his conning and wheedling and not buy into the seductions.
I learned a lot about how old Lizard Brain works and how he had fooled me so many times.
<p>
In fact, that experience &#8212; seeing what was really going on there &#8212; is what prompted me to start the web page on 
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>. Please read it. It was super helpful to
me to understand the stuff on that page. &#8212; A life-saver, in fact.
<p>
And about half of those &quot;famous last words&quot; in the list of &quot;Lizard Brain thoughts&quot;
at the bottom of the page came from years of attempts to quit smoking. (And of course the other half came
from alcohol.)
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

decades now (I'm 36) and, upon lamenting to my therapist that I've found it
quite hard to snap out of despite witnessing a few other people that I had
previously met (when I was in A.A.) just spontaneously stopping, my
therapist said something very interesting......

<p>
.....She said, &quot;Don't beat yourself up too much.  A real long-standing
alcohol problem often takes a lot of repeated attempts to conquer.  In my
opinion, the few people who you witnessed go to A.A. and get magically cured
after their first meeting or two probably didn't have much of any kind of
addiction to start with&quot;.

<p>
&quot;As much as they might be lauded as 'successes', they probably didn't have
much of a problem to recover from&quot; she emphasized.

<p>
I zoomed in on this straight away.  I was fascinated by this statement.  &quot;Go
on...&quot;, I said.

<p>
&quot;Well..... in my line of work I see a lot of people who aren't actually real
&quot;alcoholics&quot; &#8212; even though they'll argue that they are &#8212; to the point of
going overboard and histrionically exaggerating how bad they are &#8212; no, in
actuality, they're in denial about just going through a bit of a bad phase
in their lives (marriage breakdown/bereavement/job/financial difficulties,
etc) and are seeking some sort of short-term solace in a bottle&quot; she said.
She went on: &quot;Such people are quite different to the other individuals that
I come across who do have very real and usually quite-long standing alcohol
addictions&quot;.

<p>
Very, very, interesting, eh???

<p>
So: does this mean that all of the time I was as sick as a dog in A.A. and
was berated for obviously &quot;not working my program thoroughly enough&quot; could
it actually be (SHOCK! HORROR!!!) that A.A. isn't much use for someone with
a genuine, raging addiction?!???

<p>
Also, considering what my therapist said, I think that what sort of rings
true to me is that although I'd always never dared to openly question what
individual group members disclosed about themselves and their addictions in
their &quot;shares&quot; (with the weird contest that always seemed to go on with
regard to &quot;Who can tell the worst horror story&quot;), I don't know whether it's
just me, but I'd always had this persistently nagging feeling that a degree
of creative licence goes on over the length of someones' tenure in A.A.
(i.e. their shares alter over time to the point that a stepper's previous
drinking history prior to their sobriety reads quite differently).

<p>
What do you make of these observations, Orange?  Do you &#8212; like my therapist
 &#8212; think that there's many self-deluded pseudo-alcoholics in A.A.?

<p>
If &quot;yes&quot;, what do you think they get out of attendance?  Do you think it's a
social thing &#8212; I mean, are some people actually attracted to cults like A.A.
(despite the fact that they're not really addicted to alcohol)?  Why on
earth would someone who wasn't really an alcoholic seek to validate such a
horrible, horrible label to themselves and others?

<p>
Anyway, Orange, I've ran out of steam.  Hope you haven't found my questions
to be either ridiculous or (worse yet) boring.

<p>
Best regards

Hello Gash,
<p>
Now that is interesting. Definitely not boring.
And believable.   The people most likely to &quot;recover&quot; from any disease are the
people who aren't really sick at all. And the next most likely are those who aren't very sick.

<p>
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Cora" target="_blank">what Cora Finch wrote</a>
years ago, about the exaggerated &quot;success rates&quot; of treatment centers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It comes down to two things, baseline and outcome. Both can be
defined in a variety of ways, or left undefined.
<p>
The &quot;best&quot; numbers come from studies with the highest baseline. Take
highly-paid professionals who have had a DIU and get a lot of
hangovers. In 1940 they would have been considered ordinary people.
But now we can count them as alcoholics and put them in a diversion
program with the threat of losing their jobs and &#8212;
Wow, what a success rate!
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And that answers part of your question of why people who aren't sick would be in the A.A. meetings: they are coerced.
They are forced to be there by the &quot;recovery commissars&quot;.

<p>
And then there are the nut-cases who just love the cult life-style.
They make up the backbone of all of the cults.
They just want to believe that they are in something really special, that they are in with the in-crowd, that they
have access to the secret sacred knowledge.  And they will do the most unbelievable crazy things to be part
of the group &#8212; even drink cyanide koolaid.

<p>
Then you noticed that &quot;shares&quot; change over time. Yes, and that has been going on for a very long time too.
Again, I'm reminded of something really old: the way that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#routine" target="_blank">Oxford Group
&quot;sharing&quot; became rehearsed, stale, and routine</a>:
The Oxford Groups routines became the Alcoholics Anonymous routines, so it's an old problem.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

The sincerity of those adherents of the Groups who spend weeks and months,
and in some cases, even years, in traveling from place to place
in the interests of the Movement will not be called in question.
No thoughtful person can doubt, however, that their repeated sharing
for witness before large public gatherings must strain that sincerity
severely.
A mechanical element enters into the telling of the same story over
and over again, and it becomes stale in its recital. Instead of a
spontaneous witness to victory won, it tends insensibly to become
a routine performance, and the sincerity of the confession diminishes.
&quot;It would be less than human,&quot; as it has been said,
&quot;if, in such circumstances, the story should not become exaggerated
and embroidered.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hilarity, moreover, has been almost exalted as a virtue by the Groups,
and, if the press reports of the meetings are to be believed, a
jocular element enters not seldom into the sharings, bringing with it
a danger of which many public speakers with a gift of humour are well
aware &#8212; the danger of making the real end of the story the laughter
that it provokes, instead of the truth that it is intended to tell.<br>

<p>
Marjorie Harrison saw the same problem:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
You will seen an instance of how &quot;changing&quot; can be
for the worse, if you go to a Group meeting when new converts
are asked to testify.
These people are very touching in their complete sincerity,
humility and deep reverence.
Then hear the various members of the &quot;Teams&quot; &#8212; the
same type of people after they have had an intensive training
in Group methods and have recounted their sins at many public
confessions. There is no longer any ring of sincerity; they are
glib.
There is no humility; they are smug, complacent, and insufferably
priggish. And the reverence is gone completely.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Saints Run Mad; A Criticism of the &quot;Oxford&quot; Group Movement</i>,
Marjorie Harrison (1934), page 91.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another problem was how people took pride in their sins. Group members actually bragged about what big outrageous sinners
they were before they &quot;saw the light&quot;.  Buchman even had a slogan for it:
&quot;Interesting sinners make compelling saints.&quot;
<p>
So now Alcoholics Anonymous speakers like to deliver entertaining drunkalogues that recount their wild and
crazy ways before A.A. rescued them from their fun.
<p>
Nothing is new under the sun.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Sober House (Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew)<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Usually when I think of emailing you I resist the urge because I assume you are
inundated, and it feels like assigning you one more task, ha.  But tonight I was
watching &quot;Sober House&quot; and I was compelled to write.  I feel like I'm in an unusual
position to comment on this show after attending several THOUSAND meetings and being
very involved with AA for years &#8212; I was a true beliver, for sure.
<p>
These days, it's unsettling to watch the odd, &quot;everybody's playing a role&quot; quality
of the steppers in the house &#8212; but that's nothing new &#8212; I was spouting the same
robo-speech, the same fake gravitas...ew.
<p>
But what I'm writing about is a comment that Dr. Drew made.  Dr. Drew seems like a
nice-enough guy, I've got no specific beef with him.  But this was too good &#8212; so,
they're talking about the very real possibility that an addict will end up dead.
<p>
And Dr. Drew says:
&quot;I bury a lot of my patients.&quot;
<p>
Completely unaware of the obvious question:  why not try a new treatment?  Why not
rewrite that God-awful (in the truest sense of the word) Big Book?
<p>
So then the show goes on with all the familiar and completely unfounded cliches:
&quot;Resentments make alcoholics drink.&quot;  &quot;He's not responsible, he's got a disease.&quot;
<p>
And it struck me so funny that I used to be one of those people who did not see a
contradiction AT ALL between &quot;I bury a lot of my patients&quot; and &quot;The first 164 pages
must not be changed.&quot;
<p>
I'm so glad that nonsense no longer seems rational to me &#8212; all that cognitive
dissonance is tiring.
<p>
Thanks for the site, been reading you for years &#8212; you have made a real difference.
I am sober using SMART now.
<p>
Please do not list my name or email address if you post this; the last thing I need
is barely coherent nasty-grams from true believers written in all caps.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the input. I didn't know about that show. (I don't get cable.)
<p>
It really does sound like more of the same old Stepper slogans. &quot;Resentments cause drinking.&quot; Jeez Louise.
<p>
And yes, why don't they change the treatment? Any competent, sane, doctor changes the treatment in a flat minute
when it doesn't work, and he keeps trying different treatments
until he fixes the problem. But not in the wonderful world of &quot;recovery&quot;.
There, an 80-year-old cult religion is the only cure.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear AO:
<p>
Hopefully this email will not be rejected as my previous one was. To
be brief: there is a show on the cable network A&amp;E called
Intervention which seems to be almost a propaganda piece for the
twelve step philosophy. Have you seen it and what are your
impressions? Same question for VH1's Dr. Drew's Celebrity Rehab and a
new show called Sober House.
<p>
I would write a longer email but fear your system will reject it
again. Take care.
<p>
Aaron.

Subject:  	RE: hope this one makes it through<br>

<p>
Yes, it's really an awful show where they profile people with drug and alcohol
addictions and fool the participant into thinking they are going to be on a
documentary about addictions. Then when the person thinks they are going to a hotel
room for their last interview they spring the whole intervention group on them,
consisting of many friends, family members and a &quot;professional&quot; interventionist
(They have 3 different ones that they use). The person is then given the &quot;choice&quot; of
forced 12 step inpatient treatment or becoming destitute, homeless and friendless or
possibly in jail, as his family and friends tell him/her that they will cut them off
completely in every way and in addition report to the police any illegal activities
the person may be doing, unless that person agrees to go, that day, that hour, to
get on a plane and go to a twelve step treatment facility. It's been on the air for
a couple years now and I believe it's one of the network's more popular shows.
<p>
Recently they have also profiled and forced into 12-step treatment people with
bulimia, diabetes, obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. It is really sick,
and is completely propaganda for these treatment centers and interventions and
forced treatment in general. It portrays them and their processes as the only
possible treatments (even for DIABETES and OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER) and
portrays the addictions/problems as being moral/character failings of the subject.
The families are also repeatedly told the death jails or institution w/out the
program lie.

<p>
There are also two programs on VH1, Dr. Drew's Celebrity Rehab and Dr. Drew's
Sober House that completely conform to the 12 step model and show various
&quot;D-list&quot; celebrities going through 12 step inpatient programs and then living
in 12 step &quot;recovery&quot; half-way houses. It makes me very angry and sad to watch
these programs (especially Intervention) and see these people lied to and put
through ridiculous degrading and silly processes that in the end leave them
used and abused and still not able to abstain from drink or drug, and probably
more feeling more hopeless than ever. On Celebrity Rehab they even have a goofy
looking group therapist the refer to as &quot;Dr. Bob&quot;!

<p>
To sum up, You gotta get cable!!!! :)

<p>
Sometimes you have to keep a sense of humor I guess. Take care.

Hi Aaron,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and thanks for all of the information.<br>
It seems like you just gave me another good reason to <i>not</i> get cable... :-)<br>
100 channels of garbage and commercials for only $100 per month. Who needs it?
I hope that the Internet will replace cable TV.
<p>
Coincidentally, somebody else also just emailed some comments on Dr. Drew's &quot;interventions&quot;,
<a href="orange-letters101.html#DrDrew1" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
The &quot;intervention&quot; racket is a major crime. Con a sick person into signing a contract on
which he will owe tens of thousands
of dollars for ineffective quack treatment and introduction to cult religion.
That's fraud, blackmail, and extortion.  Somebody should go to prison for it.

Dear Mr Orange

<p>
I had a brief stint with 12 step recovery and various offshoots and pretty much echo
yours and others here sentiments.

<p>
We in New Zealand are probably a little slow, and a betty ford type clinic has only
just opened its doors here in 08...

<p>
One area I am ambivalent about is the centering on Bill and Dr Bob, oh and Frank B too.

<p>
Also the comment  'society in general is a cult'

<p>
My view is thus:

<p>
Before AA were organizations that did almost the same, except AA corporatized
varies dogmas and recovery structures into their packaging and called it their own.
Its a bit like criticising the chimp instead of the system that produces presidents
like that.

<p>
Also if someone is into this or into that in life... like british motorbikes,
surfing, footheads, hummers.... whatever.... you will generally fall into a cult like
group of proponents/followers who will expouse their doctrines and ridicule all
else.....

<p>
Gangs and ugly mobs seem to be a left over of a primitive past... with a head man or
alpha male leading the charge... these are very prevalent from my reckoning....

<p>
I have been wanting a group or family type thing (my own was poor) that is a
bullshit free zone but alas I have found that they all consist of power abusing
erroneous leaders and compliant serving followers.

<p>
I am without such hope anymore, and have resigned myself to the life of the solitary
mystic... 'cough' ....who now finds satisfaction and self completion/actualization
in the little things....

<p>
Its really quite a shame..... We could be a great people with a great planet but.....

<p>
Thanks for all your fine efforts  Regards :)

Hello Frank,
<p>
I've also wondered whether we are stuck with the primitive caveman nature of humans.
Cults exploit human weaknesses that are already there &#8212; they don't create the human failings.

<p>
I still feel optimistic though. I think that maybe we can rise above our primitive natures &#8212; at least, a
lot of us can.

<p>
I investigate Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob, and Frank Buchman to show what they actually created, and
how they did it.
And to counter the often-repeated fairy tale about how they created &quot;the greatest scientific and
spiritual discovery of the century&quot;, and other such grandiose nonsense.

<p>
Have a good day.
