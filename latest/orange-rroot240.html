Undeterred by criticism, Buchman continued to tour Europe, enjoying
the first-class lifestyle, and always tried to connect with the
upper-class &quot;key people&quot;, the royalty and nobility, the leaders,
the rich, the famous, and the powerful, in every country that he visited.
In Germany, it was the Nazis.

<p>
<a name="SA1"> </a>
Frank Buchman and his followers were not bothered by Nazism or Fascism.
They insisted that politics didn't really matter, because they planned to
&quot;change&quot; everyone in the world, regardless of their politics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Systems,&quot; they say, &quot;don't matter, whether of
Capitalism, Fascism, Communism. The best system will not work if
the people are lost in selfishness and sin. The worst system
will work if God guides it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Similarly, by a process of &quot;bridge-building&quot; they hope to
bring the nations to a mutual sympathy which will make
wars forever impossible.<br>
<font face="Times,Helvetica">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Bridges from man to man,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The whole round earth to span,&quot;<br>
</font>
as their song goes.
This process, they claim, has already begun, abating race prejudice
in South Africa, improving Franco-German relations in the Alsace-Lorraine,
and patching up old quarrels along the German-Danish frontier.
It is not apparent, however, that &quot;changed&quot; Nazis have
done much for the oppressed Jews.<br>

To hear the Buchmanites tell it, they had already established world
peace and universal love. Buchman had erased racism and racial hatred
in South Africa, and &quot;started a major and continuing influence
for racial reconciliation throughout the whole country, white and
black, Dutch and
British.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt008" target="_blank">8</a></sup></font>
The Groups' archivist Arthur James Russell bragged about the success
of the Oxford Groups this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the pressing problem of black and white antagonism it was significant
that one of the best negro minds in South Africa, Max Yergan, once
told Frank that South Africa had sufficient personal religion, and
needed no more. Two years later he spoke enthusiastically to Sam Shoemaker
of the astonishing racial results.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Still more striking is the fact that fast-living ranch-owners are being
turned into life-changers working among their own native employees.
No professional missionary appeal has so convincingly staggered the
heathen black man as the simple about-face of their once-careless &quot;big boss.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Not only a new spirit between black and white, but a new fellowship between
English and Dutch is apparent. Because of the Groups many Dutch are learning
English and many English learning Dutch voluntarily.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>For Sinners Only</i>, A. J. Russell, page 282.

</blockquote>
<p>

Curiously, the South Africans themselves could not see any improvement
in their country.
They were rather surprised to read in the London newspapers that the
Buchmanites had saved their country and solved the race problem,
when they still saw it every time they looked out the
window.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt009" target="_blank">9</a></sup></font>

The English newspapers continually bring us news of the wonders which
the Group Movement is effecting in South Africa. To it they ascribe
the formation of the coalition Government, and the melting away of
the barriers between Dutch and English, European and native, Indian
and Bantu; and we are told that these things are attracting the attention
of India.
It is curious that in South Africa we should know so little of these
wonders.
It seemed clear to us that the coalition Government came into being
through sheer weariness of strife; certainly it was never attributed
here to the influence of the Groups.
And the Groups have long since ceased to attract any attention to
speak of.
Their meetings are doubtless held, but little is heard of them, or their
converts. The passage through the principal towns of a fervent itinerating
evangelist has made much more stir, and in the heat of a new excitement
the former is forgotten. Groupism, in fact, seems to be rapidly fading out.<br>

And it seems that Buchman changed his opinion of Communism
within days of that interview &#8212; suddenly it did matter, a lot.
That article quoting Buchman's remarks about systems
was published in the November 1936 issue of <i>American Magazine</i>,

some months earlier, due to the lead time in magazine publishing.

<h3>HITLER OR ANY FASCIST LEADER CONTROLLED BY GOD COULD CURE
ALL ILLS OF WORLD, BUCHMAN BELIEVES</h3>
<p>
By William A. H. Birnie,<br>
<i>World-Telegram Staff Writer</i>
</center>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To Dr Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman, vigorous, outspoken, 58-year-old
leader of the revivalist Oxford Group, the Fascist dictatorships of
Europe suggest infinite possibilities for remaking the world and
putting it under &quot;God Control&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who
built a front line of defense against the anti-Christ of
Communism, &quot; he said today in his book-lined office in
the annexe of Calvary Church, Fourth Ave and 21st St.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;My barber in London told me Hitler saved Europe from Communism.
That's how he felt. Of course, I don't condone everything the Nazis do.
Anti-Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitler sees a
Karl Marx in every Jew.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;But think what it would mean to the world if Hitler
surrendered to the control of God. Or Mussolini. Or
any dictator. Through such a man God could control a
nation overnight and solve every last, bewildering
problem...<br>
<a name="live_wires"> </a>
<a name="living_spirit"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The world needs the dictatorship of the living spirit of God.
I like to put it this way. God is a perpetual broadcasting station
and all you need to do is tune in. What we need is a
supernatural network of live wires across the world to every
last man, in every last place, in every last situation...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The world won't listen to God but God has a plan for every
person, for every nation. Human ingenuity is not enough.
That is why the isms are pitted against each other and blood
falls.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;... Human problems aren't economic. They're
moral and they can't be solved by immoral measures.
They could be solved within a God-controlled
democracy, or perhaps I should say a theocracy, and
they could be solved through a God-controlled Fascist
dictatorship.&quot;<br>

When Frank Buchman gave that <i>World Telegram</i> interview,
August 26, 1936,
Adolf Hitler had already been in power for three and a half years,
and his vicious campaign against the Jews had been in full force
for years by then, using discriminatory laws,
jack-booted thugs, and Gestapo agents to get rid of the Jews, one
way or another. Frank Buchman indicated that
he knew about all of that, but he didn't consider it very important.

Reinhold Niebuhr, the eminent theologian who was the author of the <i>Serenity Prayer</i>, was outraged.
He wrote:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In this interview the social philosophy of the Oxford group, long
implicit in its strategy, is made explicit, and revealed in all its
childishness and viciousness. This philosophy has been implicit in
Buchmanite strategy from the beginning. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In other words, a Nazi social philosophy has been a covert
presumption of the whole Oxford group
enterprise from the very beginning. We may be
grateful to the leader for revealing so clearly what has been
slightly hidden.
Now we can see how unbelievably
na&#239;ve this movement is in its efforts to
save the world. If it would content itself with preaching
repentance to drunkards and adulterers one might be willing
to respect it as a religious revival method
which knows how to confront the sinner with God.
But when it runs to Geneva, the seat of the League of Nations,
or to Prince Starhemberg or Hitler, or to any seat of power,
always with the idea that it is
on the verge of saving the world by bringing the
people who control the world under God-control, it
is difficult to restrain the contempt which one feels
for this dangerous childishness.<br>

&quot;God-Controlled Dictatorship&quot;
</font>

<p>
When the followers of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman wish to emphasize the fact that the Oxford Groups include all sorts of people, they often speak of their &quot;former Communist&quot; colleague, Scotsman James Watt. The Oxford Groups lay no claim to having a &quot;former Fascist&quot; in their midst, and German Buchmanite baronesses hedge when asked how the movement works in the case of German Jews. Last week, to a stray interviewer from the New York World-Telegram, brisk Dr. Buchman readily declared himself on Fascism, now No. 1 bugaboo to practically all U. S. churchmen.

<p>
&quot;I thank heaven,&quot; exclaimed Grouper Buchman, &quot;for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front-line of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism. My barber in London told me Hitler saved all Europe from Communism. That's how he felt. Of course, I don't condone everything the Nazis do. Anti-Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitler sees a Karl Marx in every Jew.

<p>
&quot;But think what it would mean to the world if Hitler surrendered to God. Or Mussolini. Or any dictator. Through such a man God could control a nation overnight and solve every last, bewildering problem. . . . Spain has taught us what godless Communism will bring. Human problems aren't economic. They're moral, and they can't be solved by immoral measures. They could be solved within a God-controlled democracy, or perhaps I should say a theocracy, and they could be solved through a God-controlled Fascist dictatorship.&quot;

<p>
First religious journal to plumb the implications of Dr. Buchman's plea was Zion's Herald, influential New England Methodist weekly which editorialized: &quot;Just what would happen if Adolf Hitler, shorn of all his pagan power, were suddenly to become a St. Francis of Assisi? Would not such a conversion immediately mark the end of all bluster, swashbuckling, regimentation, coercion, intolerance, and persecution? Dictatorship would instantly fade away at the touch of Christ, whose whole method was teaching and persuasion.

<p>
&quot;God-controlled Fascism! The terms are mutually exclusive. As well talk of a God-controlled hell! When God controls, Fascism is thereby ruled out.&quot;

Note that all three of the cofounders of Alcoholics Anonymous,
William Griffith Wilson, Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith, and Clarence Snyder,
were enthusiastic members of the Oxford Group at this time.
None of them quit the Oxford Group in protest when Frank Buchman thanked Heaven for
giving us Adolf Hitler, and none of them had a problem with Frank Buchman's raving
about the joys of a world controlled by &quot;Christian Fascist dictators&quot; &#8212; a
&quot;<a href="#living_spirit" target="_blank">dictatorship of the living spirit</a>&quot;.
And none of them objected to Frank Buchman's praise of the Nazis.
While Frank Buchman was attending Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and
saluting Adolf Hitler with straight-armed <i>Sieg Heil!</i> salutes,
Dr. Robert Smith in Akron and William Wilson in New York and Clarence Snyder in Cleveland were
enthusiastically recruiting more members for Dr. Frank Buchman's
&quot;Oxford Group&quot; organization, and insisting that Dr. Buchman's style of religion
was the cure for alcoholism.

<p>
In fact, Bill Wilson even praised dictatorships himself, and later bragged that
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#Bill_fascist" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous
had &quot;all of the advantages of the modern dictatorship&quot;</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Then, too we have a dictatorship &#8212; and how! God constantly says to us,
'I trust you will find and do my will.' John Barleycorn, always at our
elbow, says, 'If you don't conform, I'll kill you or drive you mad.'
So we have all the advantages and more, of the modern dictatorship.&quot;<br>

<p>
William G. Wilson and Dr. Robert H. Smith began recruiting alcoholics
for Dr. Frank Buchman's religious cult in Spring 1935 in Akron. They
were <b><i>not</i></b> recruiting for a new &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;
organization as was portrayed in the Hallmark made-for-TV movie
&quot;My Name is Bill W.&quot;, because no such organization existed
in 1935 (or in 1936, or in 1937).  Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were recruiting
for the pro-fascist Oxford Group, and they did not object to Dr. Frank
Buchman's attendance at Nuremberg Nazi party rallies and praise of Adolf Hitler.
They just kept right on recruiting, and insisted that Frank Buchman's
radical religion was the answer to alcoholism.

<p>
After Frank Buchman's &quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler&quot;
interview, Bill Wilson remained in the Oxford Group in New York for
another year and a half. He stayed in the Oxford Group until
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#alcoholics_not_welcome" target="_blank">he was kicked out for
refusing to follow orders</a>
to stop recruiting alcoholics.
<p>
Dr. Robert Smith remained in the Oxford Group for another three years
before starting an independent unnamed Oxford Group meeting for alcoholics
in Akron, Ohio &#8212; still the same religion, just minus the leader
Frank Buchman, and then, finally, minus the name &quot;Oxford Group&quot;.
<p>
Likewise, Clarence Snyder was another Oxford Group true believer who was not deterred by Frank Buchman's
praise of Hitler. For years, Snyder brought a group of alcoholics from Cleveland to
attend weekly Akron Oxford Group meetings.
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Clarence_Snyder" target="_blank">Then he too finally broke away</a>
from the Akron Oxford Group (in May 1939),
and then he held independent Buchmanite group meetings just for alcoholics in Cleveland.

<p>
All three of them continued to sell the Oxford Group philosophy and cult practices. They
simply relabeled everything, and claimed that Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;principles&quot; for curing sin were now
&quot;principles&quot; for curing alcohol abuse.

Earlier, in September 1934, the aristocratic lady Moni von Cramon,
one of the leading German Buchmanites,
was personally invited to the Nuremberg Nazi Party rally by Heinrich Himmler.
Moni, in turn, invited Frank Buchman. Moni and Frank sat beside
Heinrich Himmler at an informal luncheon, where they discussed religion and
politics.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt062" target="_blank">62</a></sup></font>
(Remember that Frank Buchman spoke German fluently &#8212; he grew up
speaking it &#8212; it was his parents' native language, and it was also the language
of his home town of Allentown, Pennsylvania, which was populated with
&quot;Pennsylvania Dutch&quot; &#8212; really <i>&quot;Deutsch&quot;</i> &#8212; German and Swiss emigrants.)

At that 1935 Nazi Party Rally in Nuremberg,
Adolf Hitler officially proclaimed the antisemitic &quot;Nuremberg Laws.&quot;
Those repressive laws were designed to isolate the Jewish
people legally, politically, socially and biologically.
<ol>
<li>
One law, the &quot;Law on Reich Citizenship&quot;, restricted German
citizenship to those of &quot;German or related blood,&quot; thus stripping
the Jews of their few remaining rights as German citizens.

<li>
Another law, the
&quot;Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour&quot;,
prohibited both marriage and extramarital intercourse between Jews
and Germans, making it a crime punishable by imprisonment.

In a biography of the ardent fascist Unity Mitford (the sister of Lady Diana Mosley),
we find this information:
The newspaper reporter Michael Burn, who wrote for
<i>The Times</i> (of London) and the <i>Gloucester Citizen</i>,
went to the 1935 Nurember Nazi Party Day rally for a story, and met
Unity Mitford there, and...

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Two other English <i>Ehreng&auml;ste</i> [honored guests] travelling together with
facilities from the Ministry of Propaganda to this Parteitag [party day] were
Henry Williamson, the nature writer, and Mosleyite, and John Heygate, who had
married Evelyn Waugh's first wife and was then working at UFA Films in Berlin.
Both published accounts, the former in <i>Goodbye West Country</i> (1937),
the later in <i>These Germans</i> (1940). The SA ranks struck Williamson as
having 'the spirit of English gentlemen who had transcended class-consciousness',
which brought him to the exclamation, 'Heil Hitler! God Save the King!'
Unity could not have summed up her world-outlook more neatly.
John Heygate did not empty out his mind.
'At last we are in our places! Right gangway, top tier on the right, rather high
up, but with a clear view in front of us, and almost immediately behind the
platform on which the F&uuml;hrer will appear and speak &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
guests arriving among whom I note the leader of another kind of party, a
religious party, Dr Buchman. I note blonde Nordic prototype, Unity Mitford,
admirer of the F&uuml;hrer, with her sister Diana, looking to my mind even more
beautiful and Nordic &nbsp; ... &nbsp; to see Hitler and his show as it might
be the Lord Mayor's.'
In a letter to me, Sir John Heygate, as he now is, adds,
'Unity, Diana and Dr Buchman were seated on a bench immediately in front of
Williamson and myself. I put my hat on their bench when we stood up for Hitler,
and Buchman sat down on it.' These seating arrangements were all quite unplanned.<br>

nothing much doing on the platform. A number of brown- and black-shirts moving
about, rearranging things, readjusting microphones. Of more interest at present
are the guests arriving, among whom I note the leader of another kind of party,
a religious party, Dr. Buchman. I note blonde Nordic prototype, Unity Mitford,
admirer of the F&uuml;hrer, with her sister Diana, looking to my mind even more

a <i>f&uuml;hrer</i>, our English Leader, Oswald Mosley. There they come.
One by one they take their places. So amused are we to see the English guests
arriving to see Hitler and his show, as if it might be the Lord Mayor's, or the
Richmond Horse, or the Chelsea Flower Show, instead of a display of armed might

<a name="Henry_Williamson"> </a>
Henry Williamson gave the most amusing and revealing account of that 1935 rally.
On another of the four days of that rally, Williamson reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We had a good place at the end of a gangway. People arrived all of the time.
I sat at the edge, sleeves rolled up, sun-bathing. I'd been there about
1/2-hour when a tall young man with vaguely good-natured face came up and
stood beside me, anxiously looking towards our entrance. I wondered why he
didn't find himself a seat. I didn't wonder a few minutes later when a
grey-faced, sharp-nosed, bespectacled man approached him, and the young
man deferentially moved aside without hesitation. A bulky rump thrust
itself against my lean one, and I was squeezed up, out of my end-seat.
I turned and looked at this fleshy cuckoo. He looked straight ahead;
I had a feeling he could see with his entire left side, through his
grey suit, with its (I noticed) meticulously hand-stitched label. I
looked at John [Heygate]. &quot;Of all the blasted nerve,&quot; I muttered.
The stranger consolidated his weight on the seat; I was going to be
squeezed right out. Turning to regard him, with rising fury, I saw
he had, in his pale podgy hands, a large envelope, the address of
which was OXFORD UNIVERSITY. These words had been obliterated by a
scrawl of blue pencil, an angry sort of squiggle, as though done
with irritability. One hand covered the surname; the words
<i>The Rev. Frank</i> alone were visible. As my fury changed to
amazed curiosity, the hand, as though sensitive to my change of
mood, uncovered the surname, and with a mild triumph (for I had
guessed the identity of this thruster) I read <i>The Rev. Frank Buchman</i>.
Resisting a temptation to ask him if he thought his movement would
last as long as Hitler's, I gave a glance at John. He too had seen.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A stir ran round the miles of tiered seats. Faces lit up.
The grey-clad, grey-faced gentleman on my right did not appear to share
the mass animation. I felt that if he had not been holding the big
envelope, with its connection with Oxford University so violently
disclaimed, he would have twirled his thumbs. I had the feeling
that he was aware of everything I was thinking; and quite indifferent
to it. A flutter of cries and a stir moving, like a tide, round the oval:
down below a minute black car gliding, followed by another, another,
another, a whole string of them. People on their feet, a roar of
HEIL HITLER! no, not a roar, an eager gladness, everyone happy and
welcoming that tiny figure on the dais down there, with outstretched
right arms. The Rev. Buchman, I noticed, held out his left arm,
somewhat limply. People sat down, like hundreds of thousands of
friends, knowing each other, equal with the same trust.
I can only describe it this way, picking each word deliberately
as I write. For myself, I hoped to get a few inches of my lost
territory back in the readjustment of sitting down; but no, God
had provided otherwise. The Rev. Frank Buchman spread his knees and
leaned comfortably forward. Anyway, I'd get a photograph.
Flicking open the camera top, with its screened glass focusing plate,
I stood up and moved back the shutter. Immediately an index finger
was pushed into my ribs, and a voice said with a nasal intonation,
spoken as though to the air before those unmoving gold-rimmed glasses,
&quot;Can't see through you.&quot; Muttering an apology, I sat down hastily,
furious, yet amused, for now it was plain to me how that world-row
of jerry-built ribbon-strip religion had been built up; and in the
same way would fall down again.<br>

While Dr. Frank Buchman, the Mitford sisters, and their friends were having a fine time
as <i>Ehreng&auml;ste</i> (&quot;honored guests&quot;, i.e., V.I.P.s)
at the Nuremberg Nazi Party Day rallies, some other people were not having
so much fun.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Beverly Nichols,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Beverly_Nichols_breakdown" target="_blank">who had become
disillusioned with the Buchmanites and quit the Oxford Group by then</a>,
also attended a Nuremberg rally as a curious sight-seer,
but without any special privileges or favors from Heinrich Himmler or the Ministry of Propaganda.
In fact, he couldn't even get tickets until a German friend of his managed to get three
tickets from a scalper on the street. Nichols
kept one ticket for himself and
gave the other two tickets to another of his German friends,
Hans, a young ex-Communist who was recovering from six months in the
Dachau concentration camp.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The next morning, at the arena, Beverly Nichols turned his ticket over
and saw &quot;EHRENGAST&quot; printed in large gold letters on the back.
Nichols learned that his ticket was a very special ticket that would seat
him close to Adolf Hitler, someplace that he had no permission to be.
Then Nichols realized that, worse yet, those
special V.I.P. tickets were probably stolen.
Nichols immediately tried to find Hans and warn him about the
<i>Ehreng&auml;ste</i> tickets before he showed them to the guards.
Too late. His friend Hans was arrested at the gate when he presented
the tickets. Hans was in big trouble because he already had a criminal
record for left-wing politics and opposition to Hitler.
The Gestapo needed nothing more to convict the unfortunate fellow of anything they wished.
Beverly Nichols' worse fears were confirmed when he read in the newspaper the next morning
that his friend Hans had been executed for being &quot;a Communist who was
in possession of stolen Ehrengast
tickets.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt132" target="_blank">132</a></sup></font>

In August 1936, Frank Buchman was Heinrich Himmler's guest at the Berlin
Olympics,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt061" target="_blank">61</a></sup></font>
where Buchman offered to introduce British Member
of Parliament Kenneth Lindsay to Himmler, whom Buchman
referred to as &quot;a great
lad.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt002" target="_blank">2</a></sup></font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One of the British visitors to Berlin was Mr Kenneth Lindsay,
MP for Kilmarnock Burghs and, as Civil Lord of the Admiralty,
a member of the British Government. He had seen something of the
Oxford Groupers in their early days, and in the Hotel Adlon Buchman
recognised him and greeted him cordially &#8212; asking if there were
anyone he wanted to meet: did he know all the people there he
ought to know? Lindsay said he thought so.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Buchman persisted. 'D'you know Heinrich Himmler?' he said.
'No? Say, you ought to know Heinrich. He's a great lad.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lindsay was aware, as Buchman also must have been, that Himmler
was head of the Gestapo &#8212; a secret police force already notorious
for exceptional brutality. He asked to be excused from meeting
this 'great lad'.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Buchman added that Hitler himself was being most helpful to the
Group: 'He lets us have house-parties whenever we like.' He did
not seem to think much of England or of Canada: England was in a
terrible state &#8212; 'seething with Communism'; and so was Canada.
Lindsay disagreed: he thought that such an assessment showed that
Buchman really knew very little about England or Canada.<br>

That &quot;great lad&quot; Heinrich Himmler was the head of the

and he was a thoroughly nasty fellow who got his jollies by terrorizing
and killing people.

In his biography of Heinrich Himmler, Peter Padfield wrote
this about Himmler, Unity Mitford (&quot;Bobo&quot;
&#8212; Lady Diana Mosley's sister), and the Oxford Group:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The sense of massed power and participation in great events heralding a heroic future
was particularly tangible after the Anschluss at the September 1938 rally. Only a few
foreign observers formed a different impression. One was the travel-writer and
journalist Robert Byron, who had persuaded Hitler's English admirer Unity (Bobo) Mitford,
to include him in her party. He himself was strongly anti-Nazi. He kept a diary:
'I expected to get the impression of a vigorous evil which must be destroyed at all costs
&#8212; and perhaps I do. But that is subordinated to the negativeness and vacuity of it all.
It is not so much intellectual poison as intellectual and spiritual death &#8212; a greater
death than physical death....'<font size="-1"><sup>64</sup></font>
Two days later he attended the Party congress, sitting (thanks to Bobo's influence) in the
front row immediately facing the party leaders on the dais so that every time he raised
his eyes he met those of Goebbels or Himmler or Hitler.
That evening he recorded his impression of the leaders who had been so close to him:
'Himmler is terrifying, he sucks his teeth and keeps them bared. The F&uuml;hrer is peculiar
for the pink and white podginess of his face.... eyes like peas, but a good-humoured face
obviously very moved by music.'<font size="-1"><sup>65</sup></font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Later in the week Byron attended the SS bivouac which Himmler hosted every year. Himmler
himself received the guests &#8212; who undoubtedly included many of the Freundeskreis
[&quot;circle of friends&quot; of the Nazi leaders]. Byron
noted 'his very small hand, a sort of doll's hand'. Later that evening Bobo's father, Lord
Redesdale, also in Munich, was telephoned by an Oxford Group spokesman, saying the Group
wanted to 'change' the F&uuml;hrer. Bobo said she did not want the F&uuml;hrer changed.
'No, damn it,' Redesdale agreed, 'I like the feller as he is.' Byron entered in his diary:
'Himmler apparently dotes on the Oxford Group and writes to its English members discussing
their troubles with them.'<font size="-1"><sup>66</sup></font><br>

Many of these stories have tragic endings, and the story of Robert Byron does.
The 1938 Nuremberg rally was Byron's last visit to Germany, because war broke
out between Germany and Great Britain the following year. Robert Byron got a

comfortable job working for the BBC (the British Broadcasting Corporation), but Byron
wanted more excitement and danger and a larger part in the war.
Finally, he got a position as a Special Correspondent for a group of English newspapers
in Cairo, Egypt (where he might double as an intelligence agent).
Unfortunately, he never got there. He took passage from Britain to Egypt on a
banana boat which the German navy torpedoed in mid-Atlantic, and all hands were
lost.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt138" target="_blank">138</a></sup></font>

The most stunning connection between Frank Buchman and Heinrich Himmler was this:
A transcript of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials described the character of Heinrich Himmler this way:

He had just married Marge Conzersowo, a nurse in a fashionable Berlin clinic who had seen
through the science of medicine as practiced by the orthodox faculty.<font size="-1"><sup>9</sup></font>
She interested Himmler in mesmerism, hom&oelig;opathy, and herbal remedies. Himmler
with his agricultural diploma particulary liked herbs.

9. Evidence of Karl Gebhardt, in Bayle, <i>Croix gamm&eacute;e ou caduc&eacute;e</i>, p. 222.

Buchmanite movement.<br>

In 1936, the same year as Frank Buchman was praising Heinrich Himmler as a
great lad, Himmler delivered this speech:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I know there are many people in Germany who feel sick at the
very sight of this black (SS) uniform,&quot; said Himmler in 1936.
&quot;We understand this and we do not expect to be loved... All those
who have Germany at heart, will and should respect us. All those who
in some way or at some time have a bad conscience in respect to the
F&uuml;hrer and the nation should fear us. For these people we have
constructed an organization called the SD (SS security service) and
in the same way ... the Gestapo (secret state police)...&quot;

Later, Himmler would personally oversee and direct the holocaust,

In October of 1943, in a speech to SS Group Leaders, Heinrich Himmler declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I shall speak to you here with an frankness of a very serious
subject. We shall now discuss it absolutely openly among ourselves,
nevertheless we shall never speak of it in public. I mean the evacuation
of the Jews, the extermination of the Jewish people.
It is one of those things which is easy to say.
'The Jewish race is to be exterminated,' says every party member.
'That's clear, it's part of our program, elimination of the Jews,
extermination, right, we'll do it.'
<p>
And then they all come along, the eighty million good Germans, and
each one has his decent Jew. Of course the others are swine, but this
one is a first-class Jew. Of all those who talk like this, not one
has watched, not one has stood up to it.

<p>
Most of you know what it means to see a hundred corpses lying
together, five hundred, or a thousand. To have gone through this and
yet &#8212; apart from a few exceptions, examples of human weakness &#8212;
to have remained decent fellows, this is what has made us hard.
This is a glorious page in our history that has never been written and
never shall be written.
<p>
We had the moral right, we had the duty to our people, to destroy
this people which wanted to destroy us.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Altogether, however, we can
say that we have fulfilled this most difficult duty for the love of
our people. And our spirit, our soul, our character has not suffered
injury from it.&quot;

Erik Larson described discipine in the Dachau concentration camp in 1934:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
On February 12, 1934, a representative of the Quakers, Gilbert L. MacMasters, set out to visit the camp [Dachau],
after having been granted permission to see an inmate, a sixty-two-year-old former deputy of the Reichstag named
George Simon, who had been arrested because he was a socialist. ...
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He was suprised by what he found. &quot;More atrocity reports have come from this camp than from any other one
in Germany,&quot; he wrote.  &quot;The outward appearance is better than any other that I have seen.&quot; ...
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But in so many situations in the new Germany, the outward appearance of Dachau was misleading. The cleanliness
and efficiency of the camp had little to do with a desire to treat the inmates in a humane fashion.  The 
preceding June an SS officer named Theodor Eicke had taken command of Dachau and composed a set of regulations
that later became the model for all camps.  Issued on October 1, 1933, the new rules codified the relationship
between guards and prisoners and in so doing removed the act of punishment from the realm of impulse and
caprice to a plane where discipline became systematic, dispassionate and predictable.  Now everyone at least
knew the rules, but the rules were harsh and explicitly left no room for pity.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Tolerance means weakness,&quot; Eicke wrote in the introduction to his rules. &quot;In light of this conception,
punishment will be mercilessly handed out whenever the interests of the fatherland warrant it.&quot;
Minor offenses drew beatings with a cane and stints in solitary confinement. Even irony was costly.
Eight days' solitary and &quot;twenty-five strokes&quot; were meted out to &quot;anyone making deprecatory or ironic
remarks to a member of the SS, deliberately omitting the prescribed marks of respect, or in any other
way demonstrating unwillingness to submit himself to disciplinary measures.&quot; A catch-all clause, 
Article 19, dealt with &quot;incidental punishments,&quot; which were to include reprimands, beatings, and
&quot;tying to stakes.&quot; Another section laid out the rules for hangings. Death was the penalty anyone who,
&quot;for the purpose of agitating,&quot; discussed politics or was caught meeting with others. Even collecting
&quot;true or false information about the concentration camp&quot; or receiving such information or talking
about it with others could get an inmate hanged. &quot;If an inmate attempts to escape&quot;, Eicke wrote,
&quot;he is to be shot without warning.&quot; Gunfire also was the required response to prisoner uprisings.
&quot;Warning shots,&quot; Eicke wrote, &quot;are forbidden on principle.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Eicke made sure all new guards were fully indoctrinated, as one of their trainees, Rudolf H&ouml;ss, 
would later attest. H&ouml;ss became a guard at Dachau in 1934 and recalled how Eicke repeatedly
drummed home the same message. &quot;Any pity whatsoever for 'enemies of the State' was unworthy of
an SS-man. There was no place in the ranks of the SS for men with soft hearts and any such would do
well to retire quickly to a monastery. He could use only hard, determined men who ruthlessly obeyed
every order.&quot; An adept pupil, H&ouml;ss went on to become the commandant of Auschwitz.<br>

In 1944, Himmler would show off a special set of furniture
that he had &#8212; a table and chairs made from human (Jewish) skin and bones:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Martin Bormann's fourteen-year-old son was a passionate young Nazi going
into that day in 1944. He was staying up at the Nazi leaders'
compound on Obersalzberg, whilst on holiday from his boarding school in
Bavaria, when he saw something that brought the horrors of the
National Socialist regime shockingly home to him. He, with his mother
and younger sister, were invited by Himmler's mistress, Hedwig
Potthast, to see the Reichsf&uuml;hrer's special collection in the attic
of his new house there. Martin Bormann Jr told this horrific story to a
therapy group of the children of former high-ranking Nazis in 1990:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="SanSerif">
&quot;When she opened the door and we flocked in, we didn't understand
what the objects in the room were &#8212; until she explained ... It was
tables and chairs made out of parts of human bodies. There was a chair
... the seat was a human pelvis, the legs human legs &#8212; on
human feet. Then she picked up a copy of Mein Kampf ... she showed us
the cover &#8212; made of human skin, she said &#8212; and explained
that the Dachau prisoners who made it used the ... skin of the back to
make it.&quot; [Sereny]
</font>
</blockquote>

This, then, was the Reichsf&uuml;hrer SS Heinrich Himmler's collection
of mementos from the concentration camps and extermination centres
that killed and tortured millions of innocent people &#8212; crimes for which
he was directly responsible.<br>

Hitler. They tried to explain Buchman's failure to change Adolf Hitler
into a nice guy by lack of opportunity; they say that the other Nazis
around Hitler prevented Buchman from ever meeting Hitler because they
knew of Buchman's power, and didn't want Adolf ruined by
Frank.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt017" target="_blank">17</a></sup></font>
Presumably, Mr. Howard would have us believe that Frank Buchman was
just dropping names, again, when he mentioned Hitler.
<p>
Likewise, Theophil Spoerri echoed the Buchmanite party line in his
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#dishonest_Spoerri" target="_blank">dishonest fawning biography</a> of Frank Buchman:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In 1932 some of Buchman's German friends tried to arrange a
meeting with Hitler. One of the Kaiser's sons, who was working
with Joseph Goebbels to build up a position of power for himself,
was afraid, however, that Buchman's influence might turn the Nazi
movement away from its objectives: 'On no account is Buchman to
see the F&uuml;hrer.'<br>

Certainly, some people did not like the pushyness of the Oxford Groupers, and
their attempts to &quot;change&quot; Adolf Hitler into a Buchmanite.
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Robert_Byron1" target="_blank">Robert Byron</a>
and Unity Mitford both wrote that the Oxford Group members
telephoned both Diana Mosley and Unity Mitford, dunning them for an
invitation and introduction to Adolf Hitler, with the goal of &quot;changing&quot;
him, and Diana and Unity refused to help the Oxford
Group.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt112" target="_blank">112</a></sup></font>

But it's a bit much to claim that Frank Buchman and Adolf Hitler never
met or talked, because...
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... in the archives of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park,
New York, there is a letter to President Roosevelt from Mr Harry
W. Blair, then Assistant Attorney General, telling him of Buchman's
forthcoming visit to Germany and asking him to see Buchman before
his departure &#8212; with the following remarkable explanation:
<blockquote>
<font face="Courier,Times,Times Roman,sans-serif,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Arial">
Herr Hitler has requested a meeting with Dr Buchman. It is a matter
of embarrassment to Dr Buchman when speaking to the leaders in these
foreign countries not to have been received by his own President.
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Mystery of Moral Re-Armament; A Study of
Frank Buchman and His Movement</i>, Tom Driberg, 1965, page 66.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In any case, it is likely that Hitler was just checking out Frank Buchman,
to see what kind of a nut he was, and to see whether Buchman could be of any
use to him.
Buchman's influence on Hitler seems to have been nil.

It is also possible that Frank Buchman met Adolf Hitler through
the Hanfstaengl family.
<a href="orange-rroot180.html#Hanfstaengl" target="_blank">Buchman knew Frau Katherine von Hanfstaengl</a>,
who was actually born an American citizen in the prominent
Sedgwick-Heine family (two of her ancestors were generals in George Washington's
Revolutionary War army). She was the niece of
the General John Sedgwick who fell at Spotsylvania Court House in the Civil War
and whose statue stands at West Point. Her father was
another Civil War general, William Heine. In the funeral cortege of Abraham
Lincoln he was one of the Generals who carried the coffin.
She said that she could remember Lincoln's funeral
clearly.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt147" target="_blank">147</a></sup></font>

A funny side note here is that the death of General John Sedgwick was like
a scene out of the movie <i>Forrest Gump</i>:
<p>
During a lull in the battle, Brigadier General John Sedgwick insisted on standing at
a high point, looking out at the Confederate lines. His assistant,
Brevet Major-General Martin T. McMahon, begged him not to stand there,
because of Confederate sharpshooters.
<p>
&quot;...General, I beg of you not to go to that angle; every officer who has
shown himself there has been hit, both yesterday and to-day.&quot;
<p>
Sedgwick answered, &quot;They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance.&quot;
<p>
Zap!
<p>
And that was the end of General Sedgwick.

Frank Buchman was not the only Oxford Grouper with pro-Nazi sympathies.
The organization was full of them.
Peter Howard, who took over the leadership of Frank Buchman's
Moral Re-Armament after Buchman's death, was a fascist.
Before he joined the Oxford Group, Peter Howard
held a leadership position in
<a href="orange-Diener-Oxford-1930.html#Peter_Howard" target="_blank">Sir Oswald Mosley's
<i>New Party</i>,
which morphed into the <i>British Union of Fascists</i></a> &#8212; the B.U.F. &#8212;
during the nineteen-thirties, and
Peter Howard was the leader of the <i>New Youth Movement</i>, Mosley's copy of
the Nazi <i>Hitlerjugend</i>.
<p>
Sir Oswald Mosley was such an enthusiastic fascist that he and his second wife,
the famous beauty Diana Mitford, were married in Berlin under the approving eyes
of Adolf Hitler and
Joseph Goebbels.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt107" target="_blank">107</a></sup></font>
Diana and Oswald Mosley were actually
married in Joseph Goebbels' house, which was directly across the street from
the Chancellory in Berlin.
When it was time for the wedding,
Hitler walked across the street from the Chancellory, followed by an aide
who carried a bundle of roses and a gold-framed portrait of Hitler, Adolf's wedding gift
to the couple.

<p>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Peter_Howard_1" target="_blank">In 1963, Howard put on airs</a>
of being against fascists like Adolf Hitler,
lumping Hitler in with Joseph Stalin, but in the 1930's, Peter Howard
and Frank Buchman had
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler2" target="_blank">absolutely nothing negative to say about Adolf Hitler</a>,
the Nazis, or fascism. The black uniforms of the B.U.F. goon squad
&#8212; &quot;the Black-Shirts&quot; &#8212; were even styled after
the black German S.S. uniforms and the black uniforms of Mussolini's thugs,
and the whole idea of the Black-Shirts was copied from Hitler's Brown Shirts.
See the autobiography <i>My Life</i>, by Sir Oswald Mosley. He also mentions
his loyal fascist follower Peter Howard
there. Also see Peter Howard's book of praise of Buchman, <i>Innocent
Men</i>, where Howard claimed that he was a follower of Mosley for only a short
while, and that he was always opposed to
fascism.<font size="-1"><sup>

and died in Southeast Asia just before the end of the war. The two other Mitford sisters
were strongly anti-Fascist, and one of them &#8212; Jessica Mitford &#8212; even became a Communist.
And sadly, when war broke out between Great Britain and Germany, Unity Mitford put a gun
to her head and pulled the trigger. She survived the bullet wound and brain damage,
but was, as Diana described it,
&quot;never beautiful again&quot; (or quite all there), and she died 9
years later when the old wound became re-infected. And Diana spent half of World War II
in English prisons for being a security risk.
The Mitfords were a fascinating, mixed-up family.)

<a name="Nicolson"> </a>
Robert Skidelsky described how Peter Howard was recruited for Mosley's organization,
and how Peter Howard then organized a goon squad to protect Mosley:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of the recruits Mosley was able to secure, the most prestigious was the
Hon. Harold Nicolson.... The third son of the diplomat Sir Arthur Nicolson
(later Lord Carnock) Harold Nicolson was then forty-five. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nicolson was a homosexual who was attracted to virile and manly youths
of the better classes. His young Oxford friends comprised not just
intellectuals like Christopher Hobhouse, but also undergraduates of a
quite different type, like Peter Howard, 'charming and forceful but
terribly immature', captain of the Oxford, and soon to be captain of the
England, Rugby team. It was Nicolson who introduced Howard and, through
Howard, many of the heartier type of undergraduate into the New Party.
It is not least of the ironies of the Party's development that it should
have been this fastidious, well-connected habitu&eacute; of London's
intellectual, literary world, with his dreams of youth and glory, who
brought Mosley into contact with precisely that 'fascistic' element
that was soon to alarm John Strachley and Allan Young, and to give
Mosley the reputation of commandeering thugs to support his political
programme.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Oswald Mosley</i>, Robert Skidelsky, 1975, pages 249-250.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is also something terribly ironic about Peter Howard being such a
brutal thug that the more moderate, intellectual, fascists feared that
Peter Howard would give them a bad name.
(And it's also strange that Howard should
have close homosexual friends in college, and then turn into
<a href="orange-rroot690.html#Peter_Howard_homophobe" target="_blank">such a rabid, hateful, homophobe</a>
later on.)

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Another leading figure in the New Party was Peter Howard, captain of the
England Rugby Football team. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;

 Harold Nicolson wrote to Cimmie [Sir Mosley's first wife] 'Peter Howard
I have a feeling is bowled over by your charms &#8212; but so are we all'.

Peter Howard had organised a group of young men from Oxford to protect
New Party meetings: these were referred to in the press as 'Mosley's
Biff Boys' or 'strapping young men in plus fours'.
The emphasis of the New Party was on youth....<br>

In bragging about his street fighting for Sir Oswald Mosley and the New Party,
Peter Howard wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

my head cut wide open with a blow from a chair in the Birmingham rag
market, and was slashed with a razor in Glasgow.<br>

<i>Innocent Men</i>, Peter Howard, page 12.

<p>
(Peter Howard didn't say what he did to the other guys.)<br>
Radical politics in Britain wasn't really much different from what was
going on in Germany at the same time, with Hitler's Brown Shirts engaging in vicious,
occasionally deadly, street battles with the leftists.
<p>
Sir Oswald Mosley chose Peter Howard to lead the New Youth Movement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
From this moment [September 1931] onwards the New Party started to
have the dual character
associated with its successor, the British Union of Fascists. On the one
hand it was a political party organised to seek power in elections; on the
other hand it was a para-military force organised to fight communism in a
revolutionary situation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the New Party the split was more marked than in the B.U.F. because it
retained the considerable high-brow element which its successor lacked.
While Nicolson went round recruiting leading young intellectuals to
write for <i>Action</i>, 'Kid' Lewis was training the 'active force' in
fisticuffs, and Glyn Williams was busily introducing the whole Boy Scout
paraphernalia of uniforms, badges, saluting, flags, etc., into the youth
movement. Mosley was characteristically complacent about the possibilites
of combining these elements into a marvellous new political synthesis:
<blockquote>
[Mosley to Nicolson, 4 September 1931]<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It should not be impossible to hold the balance now that we are rid of
the pathological element [Mosley's description of Strachey, Young, and Joad]
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the whole, however, I think that Peter Howard is just the right man to
hold the balance.

Peter Howard was basically just
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_true_believers" target="_blank">
a true believer</a> in search of an extreme cause to believe in, any cause,
no matter whether it was radical fascist politics or radical cult religion.
Peter Howard started investigating the Oxford Groups while working as a Fleet Street newspaper reporter
who intended to write an expos&eacute; of Buchmanism, but he was soon
converted into an enthusiastic true believer who wrote a whole book of
praise of Frank Buchman and his followers &#8212;
<i>&quot;Innocent Men&quot;</i> &#8212; while attempting to defend Buchman from
his critics.
What happened was,
the Groupers asked Howard to try <i>&quot;listening to God&quot;</i>
in a <i>Quiet Time</i>.
He did, and thought he heard the voice of God, and immediately became
a convinced true believer.
Peter Howard was so eager to believe in something that he actually wrote a book
that emphatically declared that Frank Buchman was not a fraud or a charlatan, before
Howard had ever met Frank Buchman:

My reason is this. I believe in the New Testament.<br>

Upton Sinclair wrote a series of very well researched, very realistic,
historical novels about the Nazi takeover of Europe.
Frank Buchman and the Oxford Groups didn't escape his notice.
In <i>Wide is the Gate</i>, which was published in 1943,
Sinclair described British aristocrats gathering for Oxford Group meetings in the
mid 1930s:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It happened that one of the leaders of the so-called Oxford group came for
a house-party &#8212; so they called their sessions &#8212; and it was
natural that he should give special attention to a playboy whose heart
was presumed to be in a vulnerable condition; everybody hoped that Lanny might
be &quot;changed,&quot; and do what the group called &quot;sharing&quot; &#8212; that is, reveal
what it was that he had done to drive his wife away. But the provoking fellow
only listened and then told the story about the sinner who came home from
one of these house-parties so changed that his dog bit him.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This new wave of religion had been started by an American named Buchman, and
was now having some vogue in England. It had held sessions in Oxford and so
had taken to calling itself the Oxford group, to the speechless indignation
of academic circles in a staid university. But Buchman and his followers went
blandly ahead to appropriate a historic name which carried great prestige.
They followed a practice called God-guidance, listening to the inner voice
and doing what it told them; as a rule the instructions appeared to be that
they should go after the richest and most socially prominent persons in
every country, and, having won their adherence, exploit their names for
publicity purposes.
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The voice had recently sent their founder to enroll prominent Germans, and he
had come home exclaiming: &quot;Thank God for Adolf Hitler!&quot; So now the Oxford
and the Munich movements were rapidly assimilating, and noble ladies and
gentlemen who met in one another's drawing rooms and told publicly about
their sexual errors and how God had rearmed them morally &#8212; these same
titled persons opened their arms to Herr Ribbentrop, the Nazi champagne
salesman, and heard him tell how a God-guided F&uuml;hrer had come to
bring peace to Europe and a new order to all mankind.
<p>
<center>IV</center>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lanny was interested to observe that Pasifal Dingle, his step-father,
manifested little enthusiasm for these new spiritual exercises.
Apparently God did not say the same things to a retired real-estate
operator from Iowa as to the darlings of the smart world of London.
Parsifal, like Lanny, listened politely, but when he was alone with
his stepson he brought to memory an ancient injunction, that when
thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love
to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets,
that they may be seen of men. But thou, when thou prayest, enter
into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy
Father which is in secret.<br>

<a name="Sinclair_2"> </a>
<p>
Upton Sinclair went on to describe how a psychic medium called Madame Zyszynski
was another favorite entertainment of those same Oxford Group members.
Madame Zyszynski regularly channeled both an
Indian chieftain named Tecumseh and a long-deceased Buddhist monk:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Madame Zyszynski was at Bluegrass, and some of the guests had become interested
in experiments with her; she, too, had acquired prestige, having been lent around
to Zaharoff, Lady Caillard, and other wealthy persons. She remained quite unspoiled,
having been brought up a servant and desiring nothing beyond that. She had been
deeply touched by Parsifal's kindness, and was always happy to sit with him.
Now he told Lanny about a series of revelations which he had been getting
from the past month, supposed to come from a long-deceased inmate of the
Buddhist monastery of Dodanduwa in Ceylon. Parsifal had never read or heard
anything about Ceylon that he could recall, and had no idea why the Bhikkhu
Sinanayeke should have put the finger upon him from the other world.
Parsifal was taking steps to find out if there had ever been such a
monastery, and if it was still in operation he meant to write and inquire
as to the correctness of the details.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Very curious, Lanny said. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
He listened to elaborate notes concerning the ritual and daily life of very
dark-skinned Aryans who wore cotton robes of saffron color and bore long
Tamil names; also to details of various Buddhist hells, in which
sinners were burned in roaring fires, dashed about by fierce winds,
pierced by javelins, and otherwise bothered according to the gravity
of their offenses. &nbsp; ...
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Every evening during Lanny's visit one of these s&eacute;ances was held
and this strange fantasy continued; if the &quot;Island Heritage&quot; at Dodanduwa
was not real it was certainly well-invented. The communications became
direct; that is to say, Tecumseh was suppressed and the voice was that
of the Bhikkhu, or mendicant monk. Lanny ventured to come in,
and this caused no difficulty; the man of God talked with either of
the Americans freely. When Lanny wanted to know if the monastery
was still in existence, he said Yes, but now there were Germans,
recent converts to Buddhism, who found it a pleasant place to
live in but neglected their spiritual exercises.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lanny, ever suspicious, inquired: &quot;Might it not be that they are
working at something else?&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Bikkhu replied, &quot;That might be; they do not tell me.&quot;<br>

Frank Buchman never denied having made those Hitler-praising statements in his famous
<i>World Telegram</i> newspaper interview. Thirty years later,
the newspaper reporter for the <i>Telegram</i>, William Birnie (who went on to
become an editor for <i>Reader's Digest</i>),
said that he was always &quot;proud of his interviewee&quot; for not
haggling over the interview as printed, which he expected him to
do.<font size="-1"><sup>
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt056" target="_blank">56</a></sup></font>
<p>
(Sometimes, though, Buchman dodged the issue without exactly denying it.
He was quoted in India as saying that the newspaper reporter
who circulated the pro-Hitler story was &quot;the cleverest rascal in
the world.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt105" target="_blank">105</a></sup></font>)

<p>
But plenty of other Buchmanites since have haggled, quibbled, and
minimized and denied the whole thing. They are split between:<br>
1) stating that the quotes were almost correct
but were completely misunderstood and misinterpreted, and<br>
2) denying that Buchman ever said anything like that.
<p>
For example, Hans Stroh, a German Oxford Group follower, recalled,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In the summer of 1934, at the Oxford house-party, Buchman gathered all the
Germans present together and told us that the greatest danger to the world
was that materialism was undermining society. National Socialism had
built a temporary wall against Communism, but that was not enough.
The real problem was that people were not guided by God.
People in Germany needed to change if they were to give inspiration to
the world.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
(Ah, so Buchman's approval of the Nazis was <i><b>only temporary!</b></i>
That explains everything.... NOT!)
</font>
<p>
And then Garth Lean used the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#straw_man" target="_blank"><i>Straw Man</i> propaganda technique</a>
to attack a misquote that may have never happened:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The legend of this interview which survives &#8212; and has been quoted again
and again &#8212; is that Buchman said, 'I thank God for Hitler.'
This phrase was not Buchman's nor printed in the article, nor, according
to those present, did it represent the tenor of the interview.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Garth Lean, <i>On the Tail of a Comet: The Life of Frank Buchman</i>, page 240.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, I have read every book, magazine article, and newspaper article
about the Oxford Group that I've been able to get my hands on, and none
of them misquoted Frank Buchman like that. They usually printed,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front
line of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism.&quot;</i>
</font>
Besides the remark in Upton Sinclair's novel, the closest things I've
seen are <i>The Christian Century</i> magazine,
and Marcus Bach, both quoting other people as saying things like,
&quot;Thank Heaven for Hitler&quot;, or
&quot;I thank God for a man like Hitler&quot;:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Any dream of a &quot;God-guided dictator&quot; involves
the reality of waking to the cry, &quot;Thank heaven for Hitler!&quot;<br>

<font size="-1">
<i>A God-Guided Dictator</i>, <i>The Christian Century</i>,

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Out of the failure of the tragicomic Munich appeasement,
Buchman's words bounced back. What did he mean when he said, &quot;I thank
God for a man like Hitler&quot;? Secessions from the group reached landslide
proportions. Was he a Nazi sympathizer?<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>They Have Found A Faith</i>, by Marcus Bach, pages 154-155.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What's the big difference between &quot;I thank God for a man like Hitler&quot;,
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler&quot;,
and &quot;I thank Heaven for Adolf Hitler&quot;?
Talk about
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#quibble" target="_blank">quibbling</a> and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#nitpick" target="_blank">nit-picking</a>...
<p>
Besides, it doesn't matter how much other people may have misquoted
Frank Buchman later on. That doesn't
change what Buchman actually did say, now does it? So Garth Lean was also
trying to use the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert" target="_blank"><i>Divert Attention Away from
the Point</i></a> by complaining about how other people had misquoted
Frank Buchman later on... (As Marjorie Harrison said,
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#evasive" target="_blank">
&quot;Groupers become extraordinarily evasive people.&quot;</a></font>)
<p>
But the funniest minimization and denial has to be this one in Garth Lean's biography
of Frank Buchman, <i>On the Tail of a Comet</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Also, on 7 March 1940, Buchman's secretary noted in his diary that
Buchman said to a group of friends, 'Hitler fooled me. I thought it
would be a bulwark against Communism.'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Garth Lean, <i>On the Tail of a Comet: The Life of Frank Buchman</i>, pages 240-241.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>But Frank, how could Hitler fool you?
Weren't you talking to God all day long, getting His Guidance on
everything from what to spend on postage, to how much to pay for
hotel rooms, to which ship to sail on?
Didn't God bother to warn you about Adolf Hitler?
What good is God's Guidance if all He talks about is postage stamps?

</font>
<p>
That is one of the problems with claiming that you are talking to God
and getting infallible Guidance &#8212; it leaves you no room to ever be wrong.

Even 30 years later, Peter Howard was still lying about Frank Buchman's
New York <i>World Telegram</i> newspaper interview, while accusing others
of lying. In 1964, Peter Howard was interviewed during a speaking tour,
and asked:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>Q. Sometimes even now you hear that Dr. Buchman was soft on Nazism. Is it true?</b>
<p>
<b>A.</b> It is a lie. One sentence quoted out of context which he allegedly uttered nearly 30 years
ago is used against us all: &quot;I thank God for a man like Adolf Hitler who has raised a front-line
of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism.&quot;
I was not there in 1936. I have no idea whether Dr. Buchman spoke as reported.
He never met
Hitler. And certainly I find it strange that on a day when he was interviewed by 50 reporters,
only one so reported him.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Moral Re-Armament: What Is It?</i>, Basil Entwistle and John McCook Roots, pub. 1967,
page 89.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Peter Howard managed to slip several lies into just that one short paragraph:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First off, Peter Howard emphatically declared that &quot;it is a lie&quot;,
while he also admitted that he wasn't there and he had no idea of what was actually said.
<p>

<li> The pro-Nazi accusations against Frank Buchman were not based on
just one sentence, or just one newspaper interview.
They were based on many things which went on for many years, everything from:
<ul>
<li> that interview,
<li> to his faithful attendance at Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies year after year,
<li> to his refusal to criticize Hitler for breaking treaties and invading
Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland,
<li> to Buchman's claims that the difficulties with Hitler were really
all the fault of the British and the American people for being so selfish
and materialistic,
<li> to his praise of the Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler as a &quot;wonderful lad&quot;,
<li> to his hobnobbing around Berlin and Nuremberg with Heinrich Himmler, year after year,
<li> to his praise of dictatorships and his often-repeated declarations
that he wanted to get everybody in the world under the control of a
&quot;Spiritual dictatorship&quot; and
&quot;the true dictatorship of the living God&quot; and
a Christian fascist dictatorship,
<li> to Frank Buchman's inherently fascistic attitudes, which were clearly recognized
by contemporaries like George Orwell and
<a href="orange-rroot870.html" target="_blank">Reinhold Niebuhr</a> (the author of the <i>Serenity Prayer</i>).
</ul>
<p>
Peter Howard must have known about all of those things by 1964
&#8212; he couldn't very well <i>not</i> have known about them &#8212;
but he apparently assumed that other people did not know all of the facts,
and that he could fool them with lies. (&#8212; While Peter Howard was also hiding his
own fascist background...)<br>

<p>
<li>
Secondly, there were not any 50 reporters present at that interview. The author
William Birnie clearly described the setting of
<a href="orange-rroot840.html#World_Telegram" target="_blank">that <i>exclusive interview</i></a>:
It was in Frank Buchman's office in Samuel Shoemaker's church &#8212;
&quot;his book-lined office in the annexe of Calvary Church, Fourth Ave and 21st St.&quot; &#8212;
where Frank Buchman, William Birnie, and 8 or 9 of Buchman's followers were
present, lounging around in chairs or sitting on the floor.
That was it. No other reporters were present. That is why 49 other
reporters didn't report what Frank Buchman said there. Peter Howard must have
read that interview at least a few times over the years,
so he had to know that too, so he was lying again.
<p>
<li> That famous quote,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who built a front line
of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism,&quot;</i></font>
was not
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#context" target="_blank">taken out of context</a>,
like Peter Howard said it was.
It means exactly the same thing, no matter whether that sentence is read
alone or as part of
<a href="orange-rroot840.html#World_Telegram" target="_blank">the whole interview</a>.
<p>
And curiously enough, when this issue came up on another occasion,
when the writer Geoffrey Williamson was investigating Frank Buchman and Moral Re-Armament,
the official response of the Buchmanites was to declare that
Frank Buchman was not fully quoted, and then they simply reproduced part
of Frank Buchman's remarks just as they were quoted and printed in the newspaper,
and declared, <b>&quot;This is what Frank Buchman really said&quot;</b>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler who built a front line of defense
against the anti-Christ of Communism. My barber in London told me Hitler saved
all of Europe from Communism. That's how he felt. Of course, I don't condone
everything the Nazis do. Anti-Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitler sees
a Karl Marx in every Jew.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;But think what it would mean to the world if Hitler surrendered to the control
of God. Or Mussolini. Or any dictator. Through such a man God could control a
nation overnight and solve every bewildering problem.&quot;<br>

<font size="-1">
<i>&quot;Inside Buchmanism; An Independent Inquiry Into
The Oxford Group Movement and Moral Re-Armament&quot;</i>,

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Geoffrey Williamson published his book in 1954, so, by 1964,
Peter Howard had had plenty of time to review both it and the official
Moral Re-Armament party line.


<p>
<li>
Peter Howard claimed that Frank Buchman never met Adolf Hitler, but other Buchmanites
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_invitation" target="_blank">declared that Frank Buchman had an
invitation to meet with Adolf Hitler</a> (so he should also get an invitation
to meet with President Roosevelt).
And then of course there is the question of them
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hanfstaengl_houseguest" target="_blank">meeting at Putzi Hanfstaengl's house</a>.

</ol>

<p>

<br>
Then, continuing in that interview, Peter Howard tried another propaganda trick:
He quoted Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George saying flattering
things about Adolf Hitler in 1935. Then Howard asked,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Does anyone dare suggest that Churchill
or Lloyd George were soft on Nazism?&quot;</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now let me read you what other people said about Hitler 30 years ago: &quot;Hitler may go
down in history as the man who restored honor to the great Germanic nation and led it back,
serene and strong, to the European family circle.&quot; That was Winston Churchill in 1935.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here is Lloyd George: &quot;Hitler is the George Washington of his country.&quot;<br>

<p>
Ah, but there were several big problems with Peter Howard's argument there:

<p>
<ol>
<p>
<li> Peter Howard was lying again. He quoted Winston Churchill out of
context and butchered the quote and reassembled the pieces of the sentences
to deceive the listeners. What Winston Churchill actually said was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One may dislike Hitler's system and yet admire his patriotic achievement.
If our country were defeated, I hope we should find a champion as
indomitable to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among
the nations.<br>
...<br>
We cannot tell whether Hitler will be the man who will once again let
loose upon the world another war in which civilisation will irretrievably
succumb, or whether he will go down in history as the man who restored
honour and peace of mind to the Great Germanic nation.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Winston Churchill, &quot;Hitler and His Choice&quot;, <i>The Strand</i> Magazine (November 1935)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Winston Churchill was not endorsing Adolf Hitler. Churchill was saying that,
at that time, he didn't know how Hitler would be written into the history books.

<p>
<li> Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George were politicians, the kind of
people whose job routinely requires them to make flattering remarks about
other people whom they may actually disdain, while carrying out duties like
negotiating with foreign leaders for peace.
That's politics, and that's diplomacy.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Frank Buchman was a clergyman who was a little more
obligated to always speak the truth.
(He was supposed to be practicing &quot;Absolute Honesty&quot;.)

<p>
<li> Winston Churchill was not the British Prime Minister in 1935, Neville Chamberlain was.
Churchill was a fierce critic of
<a href="orange-rroot300.html" target="_blank">Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler</a>,
leading the wing of the Conservative Party that opposed the Munich
Agreement which Chamberlain famously declared to mean &quot;peace in our time&quot;.

<p>
Chamberlain would eventually be totally discredited for his policy of attempting to
get peace by appeasing Hitler. He was replaced by Winston Churchill on May 10, 1940.
(Incidentally,
<a href="orange-letters159.html#Chamberlain" target="_blank">Neville Chamberlain
was a member of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group</a>. Frank Buchman was telling Chamberlain
that Hitler was okay, and could be trusted.)
)
<p>
Frank Buchman had to bow to no political boss but God when he praised Hitler.<br>

In September 1936, the former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George visited
Adolf Hitler in an attempt to persuade him to stop taking military action in Europe.
Although David Lloyd George agreed that Germany had been badly treated after
the First World War, he was opposed to the British government's policy
of appeasement.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
David Lloyd George was one of the British diplomats who
created the terrible conditions of the Versailles Treaty.
The staggering reparations that Germany had to pay, and the redistribution of territory
&#8212; that was the vindictive work of David Lloyd George.

<p>
David Lloyd George certainly was effusive in his praise of Hitler during and after that
September 1936 visit to Germany:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Hitler is the George Washington of Germany, the man who made his country
independent of all its oppressors ... He is a born leader, a magnetic,

heart ... Regarding his popularity, especially among the youth, there
cannot be the slightest doubt.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Look to Germany &#8212; The Heart of Europe</i>, Stanley McClatchie, 1937.

<p>
But David Lloyd George also said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Wars are precipitated by motives which the statesmen responsible for
them dare not publicly avow. A public discussion would drag these motives
in their nudity into the open, where they would die of exposure to the
withering contempt of humanity.<br>

<p>
<li> Winston Churchill made his remark &#8212; a hopeful suggestion, actually a question,
not a statement of fact &#8212;
&quot;...whether he [Hitler] will go down in history as the man who...&quot; &#8212;

after everybody had had another whole year to watch Hitler in action, and see
what he was really doing.
<p>
By late 1936, Hitler had banned all opposition political parties,
really viciously cracked down hard on the Jews, repudiated treaties, and seized the Rhineland.
By the end of 1936, there was little doubt of the direction in which Hitler was going:

<li> January 30, 1933 &#8212; Hitler becomes Chancellor

<li> March 20, 1933 &#8212; The Nazis establish their first concentration camp: Dachau.

<p>
<li> January, 1934 &#8212; Hitler forced all Jewish newspaper editors out of their jobs.
<li> June 30, 1934 &#8212; <i>The Night of the Long Knives</i>. Adolf Hitler,
Heinrich Himmler, and Reinhardt Heydrich carried out a two-day campaign
of mass murder that eliminated all opposition to Hitler in Germany, and even eliminated all
potential opposition to Hitler from within the Nazi Party. Even Hitler's former allies, like Ernst Roehm,
were killed because they might have been popular enough to compete with Hitler for leadership of
the Nazi party.
Approximately 1000 people were murdered &#8212; some of them
for nothing more than
simply knowing sordid details of Hitler's past (like Hitler's former landlord
in Vienna in the 1920's, and the landlord's daughter, who knew what Hitler
had done to survive in those days, like perhaps homosexual prostitution).
That purge left Hitler the undisputed dictator of Germany.

<li> September 15, 1935 &#8212;
Frank Buchman attends the Nazi Party Rally in Nuremberg, where
Hitler officially proclaims the antisemitic &quot;Nuremberg Laws.&quot;
These repressive laws are designed to isolate the Jewish
people legally, politically, socially and biologically. One law restricts German
citizenship to those of &quot;German or related blood,&quot; thus stripping
the Jews of their few remaining rights as German citizens.
Another prohibits marriage and extramarital intercourse between Jews
and Germans, making it a crime punishable by imprisonment.

<li> September 15, 1935 &#8212; Law on Reich Citizenship
<li> September 15, 1935 &#8212; Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour

<li> November 14, 1935 &#8212; First Supplementary Regulation to the Reich Citizenship Law.<br>
Jews denied voting rights and forbidden to hold public office. Discharge

for Jews narrowed to just a few professions. Jewish children prohibited
from using the same playgrounds and locker rooms as other children.<br>

of the Versailles Treaty and the Locarno Treaties (1925), and German
troops march into the demilitarized Rhineland, and reclaim the Saar region.

<li> March 9, 1936 &#8212; Three Jews are murdered at Przytyk in Poland, and
a few days later, five more are killed in the village of Stawy.

<li> March 22, 1936 &#8212; Sir Oswald Mosley makes an antisemitic speech that

the Rothschild banking dynasty.

<li> August 1, 1936 &#8212; The Olympic Games begin in Berlin. Frank Buchman attends as a personal guest
of Heinrich Himmler.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hitler and the top
Nazis sought to gain legitimacy through favorable public opinion from
foreign visitors and thus temporarily refrained from actions against Jews.
Signs barring Jews were removed until the event was over.<br>

<li>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
During the 1933 Olympic Session in Vienna that approved the choice of
Berlin for the 1936 Olympics, the Germans had promised not to exclude
German Jews from the national team. Hitler didn't bother to keep that
promise.<br>
<li>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The great American athlete, Jesse Owens (who happened to be black), won four gold medals
(100m, 200m, long jump and 4x100m relay). During the Games,
he broke 11 Olympic records and defeated the German Lutz Lang in a very
close long jump final. Lang was Germany's athletic superstar of the time &#8212;
a brilliant long jumper, and a tall blond-haired,
blue-eyed man who fitted easily into the Nazi image of Aryan racial superiority.
Lutz Lang was the first to congratulate Jesse Owens
when the long jump final was over. Adolf Hitler, on the other hand, refused to put the gold
medal around Owens' neck. Hitler complained that it was unfair to allow
Blacks to compete in the Olympics &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They aren't human. It is like making a man race against a horse.&quot;
</font>
Hitler stomped out of the Olympics in anger.
</ol>

<li> August 1936 &#8212; Nazis set up an Office for Combating Homosexuality and Abortions (by healthy women).

<li> August 24, 1936 &#8212; Adolf Hitler introduces a compulsory two-year period of military conscription.
<li> August 26, 1936 &#8212; Frank Buchman happily declares,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;

<p>
<li> Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George did not claim to have a hot-line
straight to God, through which they received infallible Guidance every
morning. Frank Buchman did. They could later admit that they were wrong
if they had once spoken well of Adolf Hitler, and had once had hopes for him.
Frank Buchman couldn't, and didn't.

<p>
<li> Later, Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George changed their minds about
Hitler, and publicly declared that Adolf Hitler was a criminal, a murderer,
a madman, and a monster. Frank Buchman did not &#8212; not ever &#8212; because
he couldn't admit that &quot;God&quot; had given him bad advice or bad <i>Guidance</i>.

<p>
<li> Later, Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George fought a grim and determined war against Adolf Hitler.
Frank Buchman and his followers did not. In fact, they tried their best
to dodge the draft and avoid the war entirely.
Many of Buchman's highest-ranking British followers fled to the USA to avoid fighting
against Hitler and the Nazis, and
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#hiding" target="_blank">Frank Buchman helped them to hide
from the British government</a> in the backwoods of Maine.
And Peter Howard, the former captain of the Oxford and British National rugby teams,
avoided military service by claiming to be crippled by a congenitally-deformed foot.
Hitler really would have had a very &quot;soft&quot; time of it if it
were all left up to people like Frank Buchman and his followers.
</ol>

<p>
And lastly, I really have to wonder about this quote from Churchill,
<p>
<center>
&quot;When you have to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite.&quot;<br>
    &#8212; Sir Winston Churchill (1874-1965)
