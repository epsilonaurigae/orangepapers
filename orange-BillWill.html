<br>
<hr width="100%">
<br>I, WILLIAM GRIFFITH WILSON, residing in Bedford Hills, Westchester
County, State of New York, being of sound and disposing mind and memory,
do hereby make, publish and declare this instrument to be the First Codicil
to <a href="#1965">my Last Will and Testament dated August 2, 1965</a>.

<p><b>First:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I revoke Article "FIRST" of my said
Will.

<p><b>Second:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The following shall be added to my
said Will in lieu of the former Article "FIRST":

<p><b>FIRST:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have entered into
<a href="orange-BillRoyalty.html">an agreement, dated April 29, 1963</a>,
with Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
of 305 East 45th Street, New York, New York, under which royalties may
become payable to me with respect to certain books or other material of
which I am the author <font color="#FF0000">or which I have prepared for
publication </font><font size="-1"><font color="#999999">[understand the
background of these terms: the authors of the Big Book and other publications
get nothing but Bill and his heirs get the financial rewards]</font><font color="#FF0000">
</font></font>as set forth in the agreement (the agreement and all modifications,
renewals or extensions thereof is hereinafter referred to as the "Royalty
Agreement").&nbsp; Under the present terms of the Royalty Agreement, I
have the right to bequeath to my wife, LOIS BURNHAM WILSON, and any other
persons living at the time of my death, life interests in the royalties
payable after my death and I also have the right to grant to my wife, LOIS
BURNHAM WILSON, the power to designate in her Last Will and Testament,
duly admitted to probate, persons selected by her who are living at the
time of her death who shall be entitled to receive, in such proportions
as my said wife may designate, life interests after her death in all or
part of the royalties payable to her after my death.&nbsp; Accordingly,
I direct that all of the right, title or interest that I may have at the
time of my death in or to any royalties under the Royalty Agreement shall
be disposed of as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>A.&nbsp; I give and bequeath to HELEN WYNN
<font color="#999999"><font size="-1">[Bill
changed his Will to take 10% of the royalties from his wife Lois and
give them to his mistress Helen]</font></font>,
of Pleasantville, New York, if
she survives me, a life interest in ten percent (10%) of such royalties.&nbsp;
If the said HELEN WYNN does not survive me, I direct that the said ten
percent (10%) of such royalties shall be disposed of in accordance with
the provisions of Paragraphs B or C, as the case my be of this Article
FIRST.

<p>B.&nbsp; I give and bequeath to my wife, LOIS BURNHAM WILSON, if she
survives me, a life interest in the remaining ninety percent (90%) of such
royalties.&nbsp; I also grant to my said wife, if she survives me, the
power to select and designate in her Last Will and Testament, duly admitted
to probate, persons living at the time of her death who are to receive
life interests after her death in such royalties in such proportions as
she may designate.&nbsp; If my said wife fails to exercise, in whole or
in part, the power of appointment granted to her under the preceding provisions
of this Paragraph B, I direct that any royalties which remain undisposed
of as a result of such failure shall be disposed of in accordance with
the provisions of Paragraph C of this Article FIRST as though I had survived
my said wife and died immediately after her death.

<p>C.&nbsp; If my wife, LOIS BURNHAM WILSON, does not survive me, I direct
that all of the right or title that I may have at the time of my death
in and to the remaining ninty percent (90%) of such royalties shall be
divided into twenty (20) equal shares, which shall be disposed of as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>1.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in three of such shares
to my sister, HELEN EVANS, if she survives me.

my sister, DOROTHY STRONG, if she survives me.

my brother-in-law, DR. LEONARD STRONG, if he survives me.

<p>4.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in one of such shares to
my cousin, HOWARD WILSON, if he survives me.

<p>5.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two of such shares to
my brother-in-law, ROGERS BURNHAM, if he survives me.

<p>6.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in three of such shares
to LAURA BURNHAM (the wife of my brother-in-law, ROGERS BURNHAM), if she
survives me.

<p>7.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in one of such shares to

<p>8.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in one of such shares to
FLORENCE BURNHAM (the wife of my brother-in-law, DR. LYMAN BURNHAM), if
she survives me.

<p>9.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in two of such shares to
my sister-in-law, BARBARA JONES, if she survives me.

<p>10.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in three of such shares
to NELL WING, if she survives me.

<p>11.&nbsp; I give and bequeath a life interest in one of such shares
to HARRIET SEVERINO, if she survives me.</ul>
</ul>
If any beneficiary named in any of subdivisions "1" through "11" of this
Paragraph C does not survive me, I direct that the share (or shares) and
the life interest in such share (or shares) of such deceased beneficiary
shall be divided among the beneficiaries named in subdivisions "1" through
"11" of this Paragraph C who do survive me, in the proportion that the
share (or shares) of each such surviving beneficiary bears (or bear) to

<p>Third:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hereby revoke the sentence following subdivision
"11" of Paragraph B of
<br>Article "THIRD" of my Will and add the following sentence in its place:

<p><b>FIRST:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have entered into an <a href="orange-BillRoyalty.html">agreement,

If my wife, LOIS DURNHAM WILSON, shall not survive me, I direct that all
of the right, title or interest that I may have at the time of my death

interests in such share (or shares), of such deceased beneficiary shall

share (or shares) of each such surviving beneficiary bears (or bear) to
the total shares of all such surviving beneficiaries.

<p><b>SECOND:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath
all of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal
or mixed, of whatsoever kind and nature and wheresoever situate, of which
I may die seized or possessed, or in which I may have any interest, or
over which I may have any power of appointment or testamentary disposition
(hereinafter referred to as my residuary estate), to my wife, LOIS BURNHAM
WILSON, if she shall survive me.

<p><b>THIRD:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If my wife, LOIS BURNHAM
WILSON, shall not survive me, I direct that my residuary estate shall be
disposed of as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If at the time of my death I am the owner of a
home (presently owned by my wife, LOIS BURNHAM WILSON) located at Stepping
Stones, Bedfords Hills, New York, I give, devise and bequeath the said
home together with all furniture, furnishings, carpets, rugs, drapes and
other household appurtenances that I may own at the time of my death and
which are then located in my said home in equal shares to AL-ANON FAMILY
GROUPS HEADQUARTERS, INC. of 125 East 23rd Street, New York, New York and
the GENERAL SERVICE BOARD OF A.A., INC. of 305 East 45th Street, New York,
New York.

<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I direct that the balance of my residuary estate
shall be divided into twenty (20) equal shares which shall be disposed
of as follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>1.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath three of such shares to my sister,
HELEN EVANS, if she shall survive me.
<br>2.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath two of such shares to my sister,
DOROTHY STRONG, if she shall survive.
<br>3.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath one of such shares to my brother-in-law,
DR. LEONARD STRONG, if he shall survive me.
<br>4.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath one of such shares to my cousin,
HOWARD WILSON, if he shall survive me.
<br>5.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath two of such shares to my brother-in-law,
ROGERS BURNHAM, if he shall survive me.
<br>6.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath three of such shares to LAURA
BURNHAM (the wife of my brother-in-law ROGERS BURNHAM), if she shall survive
me.
<br>7.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath one of such shares to my brother-in-law,
DR. LYMAN BURNHAM, if he shall survive me.
<br>8.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath one of such shares to FLORENCE
BURNHAM (the wife of my brother-in-law DR. LYMAN BURNHAM), if she shall
survive me.
<br>9.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath two of such shares to my sister-in-law,
BARBARA JONES, if she shall survive me.
<br>10.&nbsp; I give devise and bequeath three of such shares to NELL WING,
if she shall survive me.
<br>11.&nbsp; I give, devise and bequeath one of such shares to HARRIET
SEVERINO, if she shall survive me.
<br>&nbsp;</ul>
If any beneficiary named in any subdivision of subdivisions "1" through
"11" of this Paragraph "B" of this Article "THIRD" shall not survive me,
the share of such deceased beneficiary shall be divided among the beneficiaries
named in subdivisions "1" through "11" of this Paragraph "B" of this Article
"THIRD" who shall survive me in the proportion that the share of each such
surviving beneficiary bears to the total shares of all such surviving beneficiaries.</ul>
<b>FOURTH:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any person named herein
as devisee, legatee or beneficiary, and I, should die simultaneously or
under such circumstances that it is difficult or impracticable to determine
that one of us has survived the other, the provisions herein relating to
such person shall be given effect as if I had survived such person.

<p><b>FIFTH:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>My Executrix shall have
full power and authority in her absolute and uncontrolled discretion to
hold and retain any of the property coming into her hand hereunder in the
same form of investment as that in which it is received by her, although
it may not be of the character of investments permitted by law to executors,
including, but not limited to, the right to continue the operation of any
business in which I may be engaged at the time of my death, for so long
a period as she in her solo, absolute and uncontrolled discretion, may
deem proper.&nbsp; She shall also have full power and authority, in her
absolute and uncontrolled discretion, to improve, sell or lease for any
period although it may extend beyond the duration of the administration
of the estate, but not to exceed twenty-one years, for any price and with
any provisions for renewal or renewals which she shall deem advisable,
or mortgage or exchange the whole or any part of the property, real or
personal, at any time held by her hereunder, for such price and upon such
terms and conditions as may to her seem advisable.

<p>My executrix&nbsp; in making investments and reinvestments shall not
be limited to securities of the character permitted for the investment
of trust funds by the laws of the State of New York or any other state,
but instead shall have power in her discretion at any time and from time
to time to invest in, and to purchase and hold for investment, such securities,
including common and preferred stocks and/or any other type or kind of
property, including non-income-producing securities or property and any
so-called wasting investment as she in her absolute and uncontrolled discretion
shall deem advisable, and from time to time to alter and vary any investment
at any time made or held.&nbsp; I specifically authorize my Executrix to
hold uninvested any part of my estate or funds for such time or times as
she in her sole and uncontrolled judgment may deem advisable.&nbsp; I have
given my Executrix the unusual power to purchase and hold non-income-producing
property and wasting investments and even to hold funds uninvested because
I do not wish to limit her in her investment or reinvestment of the estate
and so possibly prevent nor meeting some economic emergency which I cannot
now anticipate.&nbsp; I desire her to be free to purchase and hold such
property as she may, in her sole and uncontrolled discretion, deem necessary
at any time to protect the corpus of the estate from depletion.

<p>No purchaser at any sale made by my Executrix shall be bound to inquire
into the expediency, propriety, validity or necessity of any sale made
by her or to see to or be liable for the application of the purchase moneys
arising therefrom.
<br>My Executrix shall have the power in her discretion to vote in person
or by proxy all stock held by her; to assent to any action or non-action,
to enter into or consent to any reorganization, lease or sale, to pay out
of any fund administered hereunder to any committee, representative, agent
or depositary, any assessments, expenses, contributions and sums of money
in connection with any securities held by her; to exchange the securities
held by her for other securities issued in connection with such arrangement
and to accept and retain such other securities so received, anything herein
to the contrary notwithstanding; to register any property in the name of
her nominees or in her own name, or to hold the property unregistered or
in such other form that title shall pass by delivery, but without thereby
increasing or decreasing her liability as Executrix and, generally, to
exercise in respect to all securities held by her all the same rights and
powers as are or may be lawfully exercised by persons owning similar propery
in their own right.

<p>I give to my Executrix, in connection with the administration of my
estate, or in connection with the purchase, management or sale of any securities
or other property held by her as Executrix, power to employ agents, custodians,
depositaries, accountants, attorneys, investment counsel or other advisers,
to delegate to them discretionary powers and to compensate them for their
services as an expense of the administration of my estate.

<p>I give to my Executrix power to insure or otherwise protect any personal
property constituting part of my estate.

<p>In making any division or distribution of my estate, my Executrix shall
have full power to make such division or distribution in cash or in kind
or partly in cash and partly in kind and to allot to any separate beneficiary,
in equal or unequal proportions, specific securities or property or undivided
interests therein, to fix the value of any part of the property so divided
or distributed, and the value so fixed by her shall be binding and conclusive
upon all persons having any interest therein.

<p><b>SIXTH:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I nominate and appoint my
wife, LOIS BURNHAM WILSON, to be the Executrix of this Will.&nbsp; If my
wife LOIS BURNHAM WILSON, should predecease me or shall fail to qualify
as Executrix or having qualified shall fail to continue to act as Executrix,
I nominate and appoint, in the following order, BERNARD B. SMITH of 460
Park Avenue, New York, New York, LEONARD H. STEIBEL of 460 Park Avenue,
New York, New York, and <font color="#FF0000">MICHAEL ALEXANDER</font>
of 460 Park Avenue, New York, New York, to be the substitute Executor in
the place and stead of my said wife or of any previous substitute Executor
who may have predeceased me or who shall have failed to qualify as Executor
or having qualified shall fail to continue as Executor.

<p>Whenever the word "Executor" is used in this Last Will and Testament,
it shall be deemed to refer (unless the context shall indicate otherwise)
to the Executrix or substitute Executor then qualified and acting.

<p>I direct that no Executrix or substitute Executor shall be required
to give any bond or other security in the State of New York or elsewhere.

<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 2nd day
of August 1965.
