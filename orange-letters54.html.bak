<p>
Dear Secret Agent Orange,

<p>
I just found your web site and have briefly glanced at a couple of your
articles/chapters.  I see somewhat what you are driving at.  However, please
forgive me that I have not consumed more of your thoughts before contacting
you, but I need to understand what you are driving at.  Do you profess
something that works, that is, something that is not nessesarily a program, a
cult, a brainwashing, or are you simply out to antagonize something that is
by all means certainly a cult.  I will try to read more of your thoughts and
will come to them with an open mind and perhaps contact you again as I
journey through them.  If you have any suggestions as to where I may find a
more comprehensive summary of exactly what you are hoping to accomplish
through your presentation of your thoughts, please feel free to direct me to
them in you collection of chapters.  Until then I will examine your treatise
more thoroughly.

<p>

Cheers,

Hi Joe,

Actually, you have it backwards. I am the one who has been saying all along
that sobriety is a matter of individual will power and self-control. It was Bill Wilson
who yammered all of that infantile cry-baby nonsense about how
&quot;we admitted we were powerless over alcohol&quot;,
and &quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#blank_spot">self-knowledge
and will power were useless</a>&quot; and
<a href="orange-recruit.html#need_Higher_Power">only &quot;Higher Power&quot; can save you</a>.
<p>
I've been saying all along that will power is your best tool and you must save yourself.

Subject:  	the main malfunction?<br>

<p>

Hey Orange--

<p>

Every once in a while, I come across some reference or link to your material and
while my perusal has not been complete, by any means, I have read a lot of it.
You've obviously painstakingly researched your material.  I don't find your
credentials anywhere, but you write with the style of an educated man.  But you are
as able a propagandist as any of those you accuse of same.  Not that there's
anything wrong with that, as Seinfeld would say.  (The Israelis have a Ministry of
Information or some such agency that produces what they call &quot;hasbarah.&quot;  One time I
heard an Israeli diplomat speak on some campus and he said, rather candidly I
thought, &quot;Do you know the difference between hasbarah and propaganda?  Propaganda is
theirs and hasbara is ours.&quot;)   So take that as a compliment.  Nowadays, anybody
with a message better learn some propaganda technique, or they can expect to remain
as a voice crying in the wilderness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi AnneElena,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
Let me add though, that I try hard to not use deceptive or
misleading or dishonest propaganda techniques. Like I said at the start of the web page
on
<a href="orange-propaganda.html">propaganda techniques</a>:
&quot;Any time you are trying to convince anyone of something, you are
using some kind of persuasion, debating, or propaganda technique.&quot;
But it is possible to take the high road while persuading people of your viewpoint.
--Like by telling the truth, for instance.

</font>
<p>

But I do have one question for you. It seems to me that AA, as practiced by
consenting adults, does no more harm or good than transcendental meditation, or
jogging, or macrobiotic diets or feng shui, or any of a number of other disciplines
that were supposedly life-transforming for some.  The only thing that I can see
that's any different is that some forces outside of AA proper --as the entity-- have
taken it upon themselves or colluded with some AAs in some place or places, to make
attendance therein compulsory for those convicted of certain crimes.

<p>
<font color="blue">
See below.
</font>
<p>

It is only this coercive element that I find threatening or offensive, and the fact
that it has been used this way to the exclusion of other approaches.  I figure if
we're going to force people into re-education, we ought to be exercising
equal-opportunity coercion.  And again, this coercive piece is actually outside the
AA structure.  The other elements of cults don't seem to be present when one looks
at the organization as a whole.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yes they are. Read <a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>.

</font>
<p>

So I'm wondering if your negative feeling might be mitigated at all if the courts'
coercive practice of sentencing people to AA could be stopped?  It just seems
remarkably counter-productive, on the whole.  AA's own research data reflect this,
and it seems like there ought to be more than one way to skin a cat.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That would be a big part of it. The other half is to
<a href="orange-action.html">stop funding treatment centers</a>
that
force 12-Step quackery on their patients &#8212; even to outlaw the practice.
Nowhere else in the medical establishment can incompetent fools practice medicine without
a license and foist cult religion routines on sick people and call it treatment.
</font>
<p>

Just interested in your thoughts on that, if you have the time.

<p>

AnneElena F.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi AnneElena,
<p>
Those are some good questions. Thank you.

<p>
<ol>
<li>

First,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;It seems to me that AA, as practiced by

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, A.A. is much more harmful than that. One of the current leaders of A.A.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. (and later Prof.) George E. Vaillant</a>,
spent many years trying to prove that A.A. works. What he accidentally proved was that
A.A. kills. His A.A.-based treatment program had the highest death rate of any of the
kinds of treatment that he studied &#8212; <i>much</i> higher than the others.

<p>
In addition, other doctors found that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">A.A. raised the rate of binge drinking enormously</a>,
rather than lowering it, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">A.A. also increased the rate of re-arrests for public
drunkenness</a>.
And another doctor found that A.A. made a lot of alcoholics sicker so that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">they required more expensive hospitalization later on</a>.

<p>
In fact, A.A. has come out looking terrible in every valid unbiased randomized longitudinal controlled
study ever done.

<p>
There is also accumulating evidence that A.A. raises the suicide rate in alcoholics.
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
<li> Secondly,

<blockquote>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, it is forces both within and outside of the official Alcoholics Anonymous
organization. A.A. does everything in their power to continue the coercive recruiting
while also declaring that they are not doing it.
And A.A. has been practicing coercive recruiting ever since Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob started
doing it in 1935.
The A.A. organization could put a stop to coercive recruiting if they wished to,
but if they did that, they would lose a large percentage of their new recruits.
<p>
Look at these items:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">24. Aggressive Recruiting.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">25. Deceptive Recruiting.</a>
</ul>
<p>
The coercive recruiting is a big part of the problem with Alcoholics Anonymous.
Not only is A.A. harmful quackery, but it is also
a coercive religion, which violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.
</ol>

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: Addictive Personalities &amp; Moral Bankruptcy<br>

<p>
Hi Again, A. Orange!

<p>
You come across as having the sort of empathy that Abe Lincoln had in
mind when he said, &quot;I believe if we take habitual drunkards as a class,
their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with
those of any other class.  There seems ever to have been proneness in
the brilliant and warm-blooded to fall into this vice.&quot;  As I go into on
my webpage on hyperthymic, or chronically manic, personalities, on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321155539/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm</a>,
this is a characteristic
that I've seen a lot among hyperthymics, which could be why you see so
much of these &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; personalities among addicts.  As I
go into on that webpage, hyperthymics tend to act like the positive,
and/or the negative, stereotypes of artists.  These positive stereotypes
include the great empathy, and these negative stereotypes are the
artistic-temperament-style behavior problems, including boozing and doping.

<p>

One organization that may interest you, is the Foundation for Drug
Awareness, set up by lawyer Robert Shapiro after his son Brent relapsed
in addictions to both booze and dope, by impulsively taking an Ecstasy
tablet, which killed him.  The organization's homepage is
at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321155539/http://foundationfordrugawareness.com/">
http://foundationfordrugawareness.com/</a>.  Robert set up this
foundation to find more reliable treatments for drug addiction, since
the twelve-step groups have been found to have such low rates of
success.  Brent did have one neurological problem, ADHD, that could have
given him an added level of impulsivity.  He was tested for bipolar
disorder 3 times, which could mean that he was somewhere in the bipolar
spectrum, another reason for impulsivity.

<p>

And what scares me about the popularly accepted version of The Serenity
Prayer being in terms of what &quot;I can&quot; do, is that it would have to judge
the weak by more demanding standards than it would judge the strong.
The more power that one has, the less courage it would take to change
what he could, and the less that he'd have to serenely accept.
Everything's a matter of how pragmatically each person handles the power
dynamics.  You could really see this in the programs of the ladies'
auxiliaries of the twelve-step groups.  The whole reason for Gam-Anon
saying that pathological gamblers' wives should be good little wifeys,
isn't that this fits some old-fashioned moral ideal, but that this is
one of the few ways in which gamblers' wives could increase the chances
that the gamblers would quit.

<p>

On
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321155539/https://ssl.perfora.net/s105607162.oneandoneshop.com/sess/utn;jsessionid=15448c64cdba930/shopdata/index.shopscript">

jsessionid=15448c64cdba930/shopdata/index.shopscript</a>,<br>
you could see a listing of all of Al-Anon's current conference-approved
books.  Three books on this webpage that would show quite a bit about
this victim-blaming Zeitgeist, are <i>The Al-Anon Family Groups--Classic
Edition</i>, <i>How Al-Anon Works for Family and Friends of Alcoholics</i>, and,
especially, <i>In All Our Affairs: Making Crises Work for You</i>.  The first
of these was the first Al-Anon Big Book, and the second one, its current
Big Book, &quot;Al-Anon's 'basic book' reflects the shared wisdom of Al-Anon
members today.&quot;  The most noticeable difference between the two is that
the first one focuses on families of recovering alcoholics, and those
who join Al-Anon in hopes that this would somehow lead to the alcoholic
in the family sobering up.  The second book focuses on how members could
Stoically live with active alcoholics, in the awareness that the only
people who these members could change is themselves, the same attitude
in the Gam-Anon chapter of Gamblers Anonymous' book.  This radical
change has got to be the reason why Al-Anon has a whole new Big Book,
rather than treating the original as sacred, as AA treated theirs.  And
<i>In All Our Affairs: Making Crises Work for You</i>, goes into this serene
acceptance in quite a lot of detail.

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

Regarding kids learning to live with what alcoholic parents either did
or are still doing, I get the feeling that this means a lot to you on a
personal level!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Sharen,
<p>
Yes, it does. I'm the son of an alcoholic too.
</font>
<p>

Also, that website for Al-Anon, is officially the website for both of
them and Ala-Teen.  For all I know, they may even be the same group.
And Ala-Teen would have to follow the same logic as Al-Anon, that the
only choices that alcoholics' family members have are to live with the
problems that the alcoholics cause, either pragmatically or
unpragmatically.  Sure, it may not be as possible to give alcoholics'
kids the same sort of cognitive therapy that Al-Anon gives to the
spouses.  At the same time, Grasshopper on the old <i>Kung Fu</i> TV show was
just a kid, and you might be able to give any kid a certain amount of
that sort of training.  One could also prove empirically that kids like
Grasshopper who have alcoholic parents, would feel better, and grow up
to be less traumatized, than would kids with natural states of mind who
have alcoholic parents.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, not only are Ala-Teen and Alanon the same organization, but the children's groups all
get adult Alanon sponsors to run them and to indoctrinate the children with the correct
party line. The Alanon website says of Alateen:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
SPONSORSHIP<br>
Every Alateen group needs an active, adult member of Al-Anon to
serve as sponsor. The sponsor is an active part of the group,
guiding and sharing knowledge of our Twelve Steps and Alateen
Traditions.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Look <a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Alateen">here</a> for much more.

</font>
<p>

As that subchapter of <i>Backlash</i> I e-mailed you says, &quot;Asked later why
she misrepresented herself as her patients in the book, Norwood says, 'I
never claimed those were case studies.  Some are really fictional.  The
point is not which parts are me and which aren't.'&quot;  In that same sense,
one could say that <i>the point</i> of groups like Al-Anon and Ala-Teen is to
train family members how to think and act in ways that would make them
feel better, become less traumatized, solve their own problems the most
pragmatically, etc.  If you brought up questions regarding moral
responsibility, that wouldn't be the point.

Hi again! :)

Here is a link I found.

<p>

The 12 Steps Every Company Can Take To Deal with Addicted Employees

<p>

What the hell is that? 12 steps for what? Yeah ok, lets make steps out
of everything, 'cause you know.......companies need spirituality too!
I guess if a company or business is doing bad it's because they are all
sinners and they need to confess to God and another person (a company
who is a sponsor?).
<p>
And they also need to admit that they are powerless over making money
and that the company is unmanageable? Then and only then.....when your
company is under God control can it prosper!
<p>
Lol! What a bunch of crap..............

Hi again, Mvega,
<p>
Thanks for the notes. Yes, I remember seeing that program on TV a long time ago.
At that time, I didn't realize just how historically inaccurate it was, and what a gloss-over.
Like absolutely nothing about Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob in Akron saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let's go to the local hospital and force our Oxford Group cult religion
cure on some alcoholics.&quot;</font>
&#8212; Which is
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#early_coercion">what really happened</a>.
<p>
In fact, the movie makers never mentioned the Oxford Group at all.
They pretended that Frank Buchman and the O.G. never existed.
<p>
They also repeated
<a href="orange-letters57.html#Tunks">
the fairy tale about Bill just luckily picking Reverend Tunks' name</a>
off of
a plaque in the Mayflower Hotel in Akron, and phoning him to ask for another alcoholic to
talk to &#8212; and Rev. Tunks sent Bill to Dr. Bob, who was just coincidentally also
another Oxford Group member.
<font size="-1">(<i>PASS IT ON</i>, p. 136)</font>
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#Tunks">Reverend Tunks was actually an Oxford Group leader</a>,
and Rev. Sam Shoemaker in New York City (who &quot;changed&quot; Tunks and was
Tunks' sponsor)
almost certainly told Bill to call Tunks while he was in Akron.
<p>
Besides,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TV_movie">Bill's story was physically impossible</a>
because of the structure of the hotel.

<p>
They also didn't bother to mention the fact that Dr. Silkworth was dosing Bill Wilson with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">hallucinogenic drugs</a>
in Towns' Hospital when Bill &quot;saw God&quot; in December of 1934.
So Dr. Silkworth wasn't really so mystified by Bill's fantastic vision of God.

<p>
They also maintained the pretense that Bill Wilson was a stock broker who worked on Wall Street,
not
<a href="orange-letters49.html#pump_n_dump">a 2-bit hustler and stock touter</a>
who participated in stock &quot;pump-n-dump&quot; fraud.
<p>
And above all, they never mentioned
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">the terrible relapse rate in early
Alcoholics Anonymous</a>. The movie makers pretended that Bill's
&quot;spiritual cure for alcoholism&quot; actually worked, which it didn't.

<p>
One guy who has decades of experience with A.A. told me that it was a movie that should
never have been made.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Orange,
<p>
I often wonder, &quot;are those people really bonkers or really good actors?&quot;
That Cruise move was spotted by the tabloids as a perfect opportunity to
plug their respective films that were coincidentally opening at the same
time as the couch jumping.
They used to call it a publicity stunt.  You no doubt rememer Ricky and
Lucy who were forever talking about such hijinks.  You may remember in
the movie Schindler's List, Oscar Schindler plants his kisser in many
photos with Nazi officers.  Drinking with them, cavorting with
them...just to let it be known that he loved them and knew them and they
him.  All staged.

<p>

Now they call them photo ops I guess.

<p>

I don't know how nobody noticed that Cruise started to act a little
silly and offbeat and liked it and continued.  It was scripted and
obvious in my eyes.  I think Oprah knew it was too.  I can't believe
that she didn't know before the show.  Just the same as she knew that
James Frey was a little iffy.  Her producers were aware way before her
endorsement.
<p>
In any case, charlatans use the well known for their passport to
respectability.  Why did Deepak and the other guys like him not go after
the masses first?  First they became something or other to the stars.
Name recognition.
<p>
I wasn't familiar with Buchman and celebs but will look it up when I get
a chance.

Hi again, SBT,
<p>
Those are good points, and good questions.
<p>
Do you suppose we could button-hole Tom Cruise and ask him if he is really crazy? :-)
<p>
But wouldn't that sort of reflect on Scientology? Scientology was supposed to make people super-sane.
Has Tom Cruise given a million dollars to Scientology only to come out crazier?

<p>

Orange,
<p>
Funny you should mention it but I am currently de bunking an ex business
associate.  He uses the internet to take one meeting with a celeb and
turn it into something so big.  It's stupid. Rather like Oscar Schindler
in the beginning of the movie where he poses with all the Nazi
officers.  This so he can have the hob nob work as his entry card later
in the script. Unfortunately, as you know from having created Agent
Orange, this takes energy and time.  Many times, unavailable to the
victim.  I don't have time for such a mission.  I wish I did and would
expose the many idiots I have come across in this life who deserve to be
front page exposes.

<p>

The real people in any field are quiet.  Just like the great masters of
the martial arts.  They are humble and you never know they are there.
In fact, it is forbidden to speak of one's prowess.
It is always the egomaniacs with nothing to offer that use the hobnob
trick.

<p>

I think Tom Cruise is very sane.  He may drift in and out with the
jargon and lifestyle of his cult but I think he knows exactly what is
going on.
<p>
Thanks for that part of your site.  It is EXACTLY what this guy who
basically was a janitor in a former business I owned who makes himself
out to be the guru of the particular field.  He keeps using the same
tricks over and over again.  It's almost as if he refers to Sun Tzu and
Machiavelli before every move.  I can't imagine but he does it.
He repeats the same act(s) just like they do in XA.  A sly move works so
he keeps doing it and getting more pigeons.

From:  	&quot;Jean B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Your Site<br>

<p>

Agent Orange,

<p>

My take on how you have maintained sobriety &#8212; through your website and
all the research you have done. You have made this your mission in life
and it helps you stay sober. Most people have families to support, kids
to raise, and just don't have that kind of time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jean,
<p>
That is just another false A.A. idea &#8212; that you must &quot;have something to maintain sobriety&quot;.
Like that you must compulsively go to A.A. meetings all of the time, or you must compulsively
work on a web site or something, or else you will drink alcohol.

<p>
That is simply not true. People can just quit drinking, and go do something else with their lives.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">They do it every day</a>.

They don't have to transfer an addiction to alcohol to something else, and become addicted or
obsessed with that. Bill Wilson's favorite line,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;
</i></font>
is not true at all.
You don't have to become obsessed with religion, or Alcoholics Anonymous, or a web site, or anything
to stay sober. Just don't drink any alcohol. It couldn't be any simpler.

<p>
I stay sober because I don't want to die from alcohol poisoning.
I don't want to ever be that sick again.
Period. It's just that simple.
<p>
And this web site does not &quot;keep me sober&quot;.
In fact, I went on vacation from it for nearly a whole year a couple of years ago,
and went and played in the sun.
I didn't relapse. It wasn't a problem. Just feeling good in the sunshine was enough to make
me glad that I wasn't sick from alcohol.
</font>
<p>

You have offered alternatives to AA, but are they any more successful?
<p>
<font color="blue">
What evidence we have says &quot;Yes.&quot;

<p>
<ol>
<li>
When A.A. trustee
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>
tried to prove that A.A. worked, he discovered that
A.A. had the highest death rate of any kind of treatment that he studied.
<i>ALL</i> of the other treatment programs had lower death rates than Alcoholics
Anonymous did. So <i>anything</i> was better than Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
And that damning information came from a leader of A.A. who really
loves it and still insists that all alcoholics should be shoved into A.A. anyway, even
if it will kill them &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;The point is that if one cannot cure an illness, one wants
to make the patient less afraid and overwhelmed by it.&quot;
</i></font>
In other words, Vaillant wants the alcoholics to die in A.A. with a serene
smiley-face on their heads.


<p>
<li>
When
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Doctor Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
did a 3-way comparison of A.A. to Rational Behavior Therapy (RBT)
and no treatment, A.A. was worse than both. People who had been sent to
Alcoholics Anonymous for several months were engaging in FIVE TIMES as
much binge drinking as another group of alcoholics who got no treatment
at all, and the A.A. group was doing NINE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got rational behavior therapy.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a>
found that A.A. caused alcoholics to get rearrested for public drunkenness more often
than &quot;no help or treatment&quot; did.


<p>
<li>
In England,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a>
found that just having a doctor talk to an alcoholic for one hour, telling him to
quit drinking or he would die, was just as effective as a whole year of A.A.-based
treatment.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free&quot; A.A. was often very expensive: It messed up a lot of alcoholics
and made them require more expensive hospitalization later.
</ol>
</font>
<p>
I agree with a good deal of what you have to say about AA, but have you
ever thought that for those that AA might work, you could be scaring a
few away, who otherwise cannot maintain their sobriety without AA, and
thus kill themselves due to a drunk driving car accident or cirrhosis of
the liver? I know you have your statistics, and no matter how
unsuccessful AA may be, what about the tiny percentage it could help
that you push away?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but what &quot;people for whom A.A. might work&quot;? We just established that
A.A. kills more people than it helps.
</font>
<p>

You speak of Bill W. being a narcissist, and he may well have been, but
I get the same tone from your writings. You also strike me as a narcissist.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I will let that
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>ad hominem</i></a>
slide. I think I am beginning to see where you
are coming from.
</font>
<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
I have made a choice to utilize AA without the steps or a sponsor. The
war stories help remind me not to drink and I have made some friends.
While you do have one page on the benefits of AA, I feel you are doing
AA a dis-service for those who CHOOSE to try it, like I did. No doubt
those who have AA or <i>any</i> recovery program forced on them will rebel
and relapse. AA has helped me, but if I found your site before I went to
AA, I might not have gone and I could well be dead. What makes you so
all knowing and so self righteous?

<p>
<font color="blue">
And once again, there is
<a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice">that standard A.A. slur</a>
about how
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;You are doing a great disservice to those who are seeking sobriety&quot;
</i></font>
(by telling the truth).
You are assuming that we should not tell alcoholics the truth.
(Like Jack Nicholson angrily sneered:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The truth? You can't handle the truth!&quot;</font>)
<p>
You are assuming that A.A. will somehow help, rather than harm, alcoholics.

<p>
You are assuming that A.A. &quot;helped you&quot; &#8212; that it somehow made you quit drinking,
or &quot;caused you to abstain&quot;, or &quot;helped you to abstain&quot;.

<p>
It is easy to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">assume a cause-and-effect relationship</a>
where none exists. Tell me, why did you decide to quit drinking and
go to A.A. instead? Isn't that decision what really saved your life?
<p>
I do not pretend to be &quot;all knowing&quot;.
I do know how to read doctors' reports though, and I've read a bunch of them.
I also know how to read books, and I've read
<a href="orange-bibliography.html">a bunch of them</a> too.
</font>
<p>
<a name="obsess"> </a>
You strike me as an angry, obsessed narcissist &#8212; just like Bill W.
<p>

I do resent it when a fake healer lies to my face about what &quot;treatment&quot; might save my life.
That is not only insulting; foisting quackery on sick people is in fact a despicable crime.

From:  	Natalie A.<br>
Subject:  	My experience in AA.<br>

<p>

In January of 2005 I entered the doors of AA. This was one of the
biggest mistakes I have ever made in my life. One of the members in the
program was a man that had known me from somewhere else and had a crush
on me. The program allowed this man to stalk me. I went through two
&quot;sponsors&quot; who both spoke to this man giving him details about all of
our conversations, allowing him to dictate what I was to be told to do.
There was no real help for me here.
<p>
When I did not respond correctly to
his and the programs deceitful behavior, the next thing I knew he
started to date my second and last sponsor and he, with the help of
other &quot;sober&quot; alcoholics decided to place surveillance equipment into my
home. I am a single mother of 3 children and the next thing I knew all
of my personal business, and to let you know I did not follow the keep
in touch with other alcoholics up, I would go to a meeting and everyone
there would have the information on what went on in my home without me
saying a word to anyone.
<p>
So much for <i>&quot;principles before personalities,
our primary purpose is to help other alcoholics achieve sobriety, and
carrying out God's will in every area of our lives.&quot;
</i>
<p>
This program is
supposed to be based on honesty and God, I did not see anyone there
really working the program that they profess to live by. And as far as
God as we understand him, that does not mean make up a God to allow you
to live on self will. That is a false god and there are no guidelines or
rules to live by, you just want to be a &quot;dry drunk&quot; in my opinion.
<p>
I am
aiming tell my story to make others aware that this place can be very
dangerous. My children have been exposed to the whole program. The A.A. members all
know where I live and what schools my children go to. People I have never even
spoken to knew all about me and my family. And not one person even
bothered to call the Police. This all happened in the Houston and
surrounding area. Please contact me and let me know how I may be able to
post my story on your page.
<p>

im sorry that you feel so strongly against AA and that

idea of the steps, which really are the program.  the
message gets lost in meetings, too many people only
&quot;think&quot; they know what they are talking about and ruin
peoples image of what this is all about.  it is
unfortunate, but most of them are really only trying
to help.

<p>

the true message of AA is not about Bill, meetings,
slogans, sponsors, making coffee or smoking
cigarettes, or any of that.  its not a cult or a
religion, and it is not about simply &quot;stopping
drinking&quot;.  you dont need to be an alcoholic to have a
drinking problem.  its about recovering from
alcoholism and showing others how they can do it
aswell.  thats it, very simple.  its not about
recruiting anyone to our &quot;cult&quot;, its about HELPING
people.  its not about controlling people.  i have a
sponsor and I sponsor other guys.  my sponsor doesnt
tell me what to do, he shows me how i can be more
effective at helping other people, and i do the same
for my sponsees.  there is no advice given, no orders.
its &quot;this is what i did, this is what i got, if you
do what i did youll probably get what i got, its up to
you.&quot;

<p>

i do it because &quot;just not drinking&quot; doesnt work for
me, I CAN DO IT, sure &#8212; but my life just sucks without
my solution.  i drink because of the way i feel sober,
thats it.  when i drink that feeling goes away. it is
my solution, not my problem. eventually if i just dont
drink, whether its in a few days or a few years, the
pain of being sober leads me back to drinking again.
i know because its happened to me.

<p>

in order to be happy i had to get rid of my
resentments and my fears and rely on something greater
than myself to help me.  i know it sounds silly and
culty, but in my experience its all that has ever
worked for me.  i am not weak, i am happy and i love
my life.  i am useful and productive, i dont only
think about myself all the time.

<p>

i am glad that youve found an alternate solution and i
hope it continues to work for you.  but at the same
time i wish you would stop putting down AA.  it has
many flaws, sure, and most people in it dont know what
theyre talking about and unintentionally mislead
people because they dont know any better.  and the big
book i full of inconsistencies, and the founders
werent as principled as the message they were
carrying. but the steps, the message itself is a good
one and helps many people who really want it.  please
try to see this.  and please try to stop being so
ignorant toward the steps, i can tell youve never
worked them so how do you really know what you are
talking about?  you yourself are guilty of
misinformation, arent you? maybe you should give them
a try.. because it doesnt look like your quality of
life is so great given youve devoted so much to such a
hateful thing..
<a name="resentment"> </a>
  and im sorry if im being judgemental
or jumping to conclusions but it sounds like you have
a serious resentment and if its not controlling your
life its definately occupying a lot of your time.

<p>

well anyway good luck to you, i look forward to reply
if you want.

<p>

thanks<br>

Hello Dave,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Unfortunately, you are ignoring a lot of glaring facts about A.A. and the true nature
of the Twelve Steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Yes,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">Alcoholics Anonymous is a religion</a>.
Six of the Twelve Steps talk about God, and how you have to surrender your will and
your life to God, and God will save you from Demon Rum, etc. That is a religion.
The double-talk about &quot;It's spiritual, not religious&quot; is
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges">a meaningless distinction without a difference</a>.

<p><li>
Alcoholics Anonymous is a cult. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>, the whole thing, questions and answers.
<p><li>
I do grasp
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">the real meaning of the 12 Steps</a>.
They are nothing other than Frank Buchman's procedures
for indoctrinating newcomers to his cult religion.

<p><li>
If you really want to help people, then why don't you tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to newcomers about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">the actual A.A. failure rate</a>,
and the real history of Alcoholics Anonymous?
<p><li>
The fact that you feel more comfortable by going to A.A. meetings does not make them good
things.
<p><li>
I am not &quot;putting down AA&quot;. I am telling the truth about an organization that lies
and leads many alcoholics to their doom.

<p><li>
I am not &quot;being so ignorant toward the steps&quot;.
I know exactly what they are, and they are harmful cult practices.
Read about
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">the theology of the Oxford Groups</a> again.
<p>
The Steps may make you feel good, but
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">they kill a lot of other people</a>.

<p><li>
And no, I am not going to &quot;give the Steps a try&quot;.
That is a standard cult trick,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You aren't qualified to judge our Master's teachings, because you haven't done the
practices. But if you just try our ways for a year, you will see that it is all true.&quot;
</font>
<p>
If you do their practices for a year, you will be so brainwashed that you will believe
anything they say.
</ol>
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hello Dave,
<p>
I have to say that yes resentment is the poison to all alcoholics,
however, when you are a single mother of 3 children and your home life
is viewed all over the program like the Truman Show how can you not be
angry? If someone commits a criminal act towards you which threatens
your family's safety are you gonna be ok with that?
<p>
Let me tell you, I
was at home taking care of my 4 year old daughters fever, she had over
101 her fever was spiking up every couple of hours. My mother and I
could not remember if we could alternate Motrin and Tylenol every 2 or 4
hours, call it a brain drain if you will. Anyway, I went to a meeting
very shortly after without talking to anyone in the program, a man who
had just been let out of jail for possession of child porn informed me
when I got there, keep in mind I did not say a word to anyone about the
confusion my mother and I had, and he said &quot;Oh and by the way, it's
every 2 hours not 4 to alternate.&quot; This would not scare you?

<p>
Also, God is
in several steps. If you have God in your heart you would not do
something like this. That is your higher power.
<p>
And yes, I will take the
time to tell my story. This man followed me by the usage of others in
the program to stalk me. He also did some other things to me through
others, which I do not want to get into.
<p>
And yes I did work the steps,
but some things you cannot allow to just drop. I could one day have one
of my children missing due to these people.
<p>
And when the whole group is
involved and no one will say a word to the Police to protect the sick,
VERY SICK individual and put 3 children at risk this is a CULT!
<p>
From
what I read in the steps we are to stop tornadoing through peoples lives
and take responsibility for our own actions.
I gave them over a year. I
am aiming at this because if it could happen to me it could happen to
someone else, and worse things could happen to them.
<p>

Also in the God
aspect, turning it into just Spirituality, anyone can come up with a
Power Greater Than Ourselves, this is a false made up God, in doing this
we can come up with a vision of God that suits our own will and justify
our self centered actions.
<p>
Yes it is personal, however one bad apple can
spoil the whole bunch if the apple knows and can scare a lot of people
because they know he can be vindictive. He has used this to ruin my name
because I rejected him and I am living with this day to day. So yes, I
am going to reach out and not be a rug. This is wrong and is criminal.
<p>

<p>

From:  	&quot;Alison C&quot;<br>
Subject:  	holy cow<br>

<p>
I just read part of your screed here:<br>
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult_a1.html">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult_a1.html</a>

<p>
I see you have a point of view--you quote all kinds of non-Conference (AA
Conference) approved literature (Hazeldon, alt.recovery.aa, Where Did
Everybody Go?) to support it. There's also reference to many AA &quot;slogans,&quot;
and the majority of them are inaccurate.

<p>
I wanted to let you know my experience is completely contrary to your point
of view. I have never been compelled or forced to do anything I didn't want
to. AA has got to be the least cult-y group I've ever run into. They don't
hit me up for money, they don't lock me in a room, they don't call me, they
don't write to me, they don't starve me, they don't cut me off from my
family. People are free to come and go as they please. People are also free
to interpret the literature as they choose. People can go to meetings or not
go to meetings, get a sponsor or not, work the Steps or not. No one HAS to
do anything in AA. It is a program of suggestions. There is no right way or
wrong way. You compare it to Scientology &amp; Amway! Two organizations that are
notorious for separating people from their money!

<p>
I found your site because I was searching for &quot;bone-crushing juggernaut&quot; on
Google. I see you have quoted that as well--completely out of context.

<p>
Anyway. I am guessing that this email will be in vain, and this a pointless
exercise. But I had to say something. I don't know where you came into
contact with AA, but I've never run into the program you are describing.
I've been to meetings in New York, Massachusetts, New Mexico, California and
overseas. No one made me go, and no one is making me stay.

<p>
I trust that you have found a way to serenity that works for you, as I have
for me (AA).

<p>
Cheers!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Alison,
<p>
By a funny coincidence, the letter that came in immediately before yours
tells a very different story of another woman's experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-letters54.html#Natalie">Look here</a>.
<p>
In fact, I have lots and lots of A.A. horror stories that readers have sent in.
Look at these three for starters:
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters11.html#AA_UK">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters37.html#horror">here</a>.

<p>
And your protest that I quote non-Conference-Approved literature is as phony as a three-dollar
bill. Hazelden is totally devoted to proselytizing for Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12-Step religion.
Hazelden publishes hundreds of books that promote 12-Step everything.
Hazelden is also the world's largest redistributor of AAWS (Alcoholics Anonymous [World] Services, Inc.)
Council-approved publications, including the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
Then, when I quote Hazelden's books to
show just how radical and crazy the Steppers are, you protest that they don't count
because they aren't &quot;Council-approved&quot;.
That is just a standard A.A. dodge.
<p>
That is the beauty of using front groups: You can have your cake and
eat it too when it comes to promoting A.A. &#8212; you get all of the benefits
of the propagandizing and proselytizing, and then proclaim yourselves
innocent and accept none of the blame for the madness.

<p>
The truth is, everything that Alcoholics Anonymous members do, including
writing and publishing dogmatic 12-Step books through Hazelden, <i>is</i> &quot;the real
A.A.&quot;. What &quot;the real A.A.&quot; actually consists of is not
just some &quot;Council-approved&quot; abstact ideal that only exists
at the A.A. headquarters. &quot;The real A.A.&quot; is not just what
some Council says it is. The real A.A. is what the real A.A. members
are really doing.
<p>
Oh, and now
<a href="orange-letters54.html#HEART">Hazelden is campaigning to get more money from Congress</a>
for 12-Step treatment of alcoholics. Such 12-Step treatment centers are, of course, little more than
recruiting agencies for Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Oh, speaking of money, the 12-Step treatment centers are just as good as Amway or Scientology
for separating people from their money.
Such treatment centers charge anything from $10,000 to $30,000 for a 28-day-long program that is
essentially just one long A.A. meeting.
And
<a href="orange-letters11.html#seven_rehabs">you can pay that again and again</a>
when the treatment doesn't work. (They don't give guarantees.)
You can <i>&quot;Keep Coming Back&quot;</i> until you don't have a dime.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Date:  	Mon, June 12, 2006 18:06<br>
From:  	&quot;John M.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	is this socially harmful<br>

<p>

I was sober for many years and started relapsing about five years ago
and have not been able to go over about a year before I start
drinking again; these relapses are generally of a couple months
duration.  I got sober in a non-religious rehab and stayed sober for
over 15 years without benefit of A.A.  This last relapse I fell and
came close to accidentally killing myself and so I started attending
A.A. and actually doing the 12 steps.
<p>
At first I had a lot of
theological problems; especially accepting the fact that a medical
problem was being treated by &quot;becoming spiritual&quot;,  I did not believe
that a lack of spirituality is why I drank in the first place so,
while it couldn't hurt me, I also didn't see why it would make me
able to stay sober.
<p>
But despite this reluctance I decided to give it
a chance;  I did for awhile and I started to feel worse and worse
about myself the longer I worked the &quot;program&quot;.  I eventually
realized that the constant harping on the negative was making me
depressed and self-loathing (problems I had never had before).
<p>
I
decided to not actually do the 12 steps (I actually had some deep
theological questions about the whole thing anyway which I was
ignoring but which gnawed away at me) but to continue to attend for
social reasons, companionship, and sometimes just to be around other
people who are sober. This is especially true since I had only
recently relocated here and hardly no anyone.
<p>
See any problems with using the A.A. group in this way?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question.
<p>
Yes, I do see problems with attending A.A. meetings for the companionship.
<p>
First off, you are going to be given a lot of misinformation about alcoholism and recovery.
Even when you know that it is wrong, it can sort of soak into you anyway, just through
the constant repetition and the subtle pressure to conform to the group.
Even people who are really nice people will keep on parrotting untrue dogma without
even knowing how untrue it is.
Things like:
<ul>
<li> Oh,
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">us alcoholics, we are all alike</a>.
<li> We are powerless over alcohol after we get triggered.
<li> Us alcoholics, we all have short fuses and can't stand frustration.
<li> Us alcoholics, we are selfish and self-centered.
<li> You will relapse if you don't keep coming back to these meetings.
<li> You will relapse if you don't <i>Work A Strong Program</i>.
<li> A.A. is the <i>tried and true</i> way.
<li> You drank because you have character defects.
<li> You need to do a Fifth Step and confess everything.
<li> Alcohol made me do it.
<li> You need to get a sponsor.
<li> We are powerless over alcohol. (That's Step 1.)
<li> Higher Power is willing to
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand">deliver miracles on demand</a>, just because.
<li> Getting work orders by psychic means is normal. (That's Step 11.)
<li> Alcoholics are disgusting.
<li> Bill Wilson was a genius to make up twelve such perfect steps that can solve all of the
problems of the world.
<li> People who have more sober time than you do are wiser and more spiritual than you are.
When they speak, you should shut up and listen. <i>(It doesn't matter if
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">the old-timer is a child molester</a>,
he's still more knowledgeable and more spiritual than you are.)</i>
<li>
There are zillions more.
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#tenets_list">Look at this list of A.A. tenets</a>
for more of what you will hear.
</ul>

<p>
In addition, a lot of people have written to me to say that as soon as they decided to
stay sober by doing it their own way, rather than the A.A. way,
their former &quot;friends&quot; in A.A. dropped them like a hot potato.
They were often ostracized and shunned.
Look at
<a href="orange-letters13.html#dumped">this story</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters51.html#bad_sponsor">this one</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters30.html#shunned">this one</a>.
<p>
So much of the &quot;friendship&quot; that you will be getting in A.A. is conditional
&#8212; based on your conforming to the A.A. members' expectations.

<p>
Now that doesn't mean that you can't go to A.A. meetings and have a good time.
<p>
But I couldn't. As soon as they incanted,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has
thoroughly followed our path...&quot;</i></font>,
I was feeling frustrated, and thinking,
&quot;Jeez Louise! Why won't they ever tell the truth, just for a change?&quot;
<p>
So I went to SMART meetings where we could tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth.

<p>
You might want to look for some
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321155539/http://www.smartrecovery.org/">SMART</a>
meetings, by the way. They are an alternative.
You might also check out the other alternatives, and see whether you
prefer a different flavor or style of sobriety club.
I just posted the list in another letter,
<a href="orange-letters54.html#alt_list">here</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.

[2nd letter from John M.:]
<p>

Date:  	Wed, June 14, 2006 11:56<br>
From:  	&quot;John M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	addendum to A.A. as a social group<br>

<p>

Sorry, but I did not give you my name; It is John.  I wrote about
using Alcoholics Anonymous as a social group and as to whether there
were any inherent dangers in this.  Just thought that I would add
that I brought up your web-site in a meeting once (stupid thing to
do) but was actually surprised at the people who came up after the
meeting, one guy with over ten years of sobriety said &quot;You know he is
right about most things, but it is a good place to socialize&quot;.
<p>
I
also wanted to ask if you know if Einstein actually said &quot;insanity is
trying the same thing over and over and expecting different
results&quot;?  This is the standard answer people in A.A. give when you
tell them that you aren't insane.
<p>
It is interesting that Bill W.
went on to explain insanity in the big book completely differently
and saying some people could not get follow the program as they
&quot;suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders&quot;, it is also an
interesting definition of insanity in that anyone who has followed
the 12 step program and then relapsed would be &quot;insane&quot; to try it
again.  I think that A.A. is actually made up of a few &quot;true
believers&quot; and the rest of the people are there mostly for social
support.
<p>
Well thanks for your papers, I enjoy reading them.
<p>
Thanks,<br>
John

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
I don't know who originated the popular A.A. saying about insanity.
I searched through a few web sites of famous quotations, and got zero hits.
<p>
What I do know is, if you point out that the Twelve Steps do not work and have never worked
for making people quit drinking,
and it is insane to keep on doing them and expecting a different result,
you don't get any agreement from most true-believer Steppers. :-)
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane">Frank Buchman had a different definition of insanity</a>:
He declared that anyone who was living
a life based on self-will was insane, and that you could only be restored to sanity by doing
the Will of God (as Frank heard God dictating orders).
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Sanity is living a life based on God's will, rather than your own.&quot;
</i></font>
But then it was Frank who got to say just what God wanted, of course.


<p>
Bill Wilson repeated the gist of that doctrine, and even today you will hear old-timers
declaring that Step Two really means that people get converted to doing the Will of God,
rather than wasting their lives doing what they wish to do.
<ul>
<li> To a beginner, the &quot;insanity&quot; term in Step Two means that
someone was insanely drinking far too much alcohol, and killing himself.<br>

<li> To the true believer old-timer, the &quot;insanity&quot; was living a life <b>not
spent</b> &quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God.&quot;<br>
</ul>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The first requirement is that we be convinced that any life run on self-will
can hardly be a success. On that basis we are almost always in collision
with something or somebody, even though our motives are good.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, &quot;How It Works&quot;, page 60.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We trust infinite God rather than our finite selves. We are in the world
to play the role He assigns.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, &quot;How It Works&quot;, page 68.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I agree about the mix in A.A. meetings being a few hard-core true believers
and a lot of unconvinced people who are there for the sober social club.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hello Orange.
<p>
Just browsing your mail at 02:45 local (Glasgow,
Scotland) and, reading
<a href="orange-letters52.html#propa">the letter
[that praised the file about Propaganda Techniques]</a>,
I mentally wrote my reply. Your blue
and red reply was identical to mine! Your essay (or should I say &quot;book&quot;)
on Propaganda and Debating Techniques is a brilliant piece of research
and has been printed and circulated here for general education, not just
in it's A.A. criticism.

Hi Gordon,
<p>
Wasn't that letter something else? He started off praising the file
that exposes propaganda techniques, and then he dove right into using them.
<p>
Oh well, whatever.

Thanks for the compliments, and you have a good day too.

Subject:  	goals<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange
<p>
I love your site...... its complete and
comphrehensive..... by the way, what is your ultimate goal in doing the
website?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. My goals are:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
To get the truth out. People should have better information about what is really going on
in the &quot;drug and alcohol recovery&quot; field.
They should be able to make informed choices.
They should know what the real success rate
of treatment programs is. They should be able to find out that the much-touted 12-Step
program has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">a horrendous failure rate</a>,
rather than being a great success.
And they might also want to know that Alcoholics Anonymous has been
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">a fraud and a con since the very beginning</a>.

<p>
<li> I want to stop coercive recruiting. There are both medical and Constitutional problems
with sentencing alcoholics to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
And again, treatment centers have no business demanding that sick people go
to A.A. meetings as part of the &quot;treatment&quot;.

<p>
<li> I want to
<a href="orange-action.html">stop any government funding</a> of 12-Step programs.
Nowhere else, besides in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation field,
can incompetent quacks with a proven history of failure collect billions of dollars
for foisting the practices of a cult religion on sick people and calling it &quot;treatment&quot;.
Likewise, the health insurance companies should not have to pay for 12-Step treatment
either.
</ol>

<p>
Thanks for the question. Have a good day.

Hello Soberdove,
<p>
Good morning to you too.<br>
I suppose everybody is entitled to their opinion.
<p>
I have often felt like a fool &#8212; like when I wasted decades of my life consuming alcohol and
tobacco when I could have been doing something much healthier and happier.
<p>
But I don't feel like a fool for figuring out the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous.

I don't suppose it would do much good to tell you that I have 5 1/2 years

Hello again, RTB,
<p>
Oh yes, the coffee thing. I love it.
<p>
<b>&quot;Coffee May Protect Liver From Alcohol, Study Says&quot;</b>
<p>
I don't know yet whether there is any truth to it,
but it is definitely entertaining news.

<p>
Now, as a coincidence, I seem to be proof that it is true.
I was also a hard-core coffeeholic, as well as an alcoholic, and I don't have
cirrhosis of the liver. One secretary even accused me of living on legalized speed, because
I drank so much strong coffee.

<p>
But here is a great place to
say that anecdotal evidence is worthless, no matter how good it sounds. Just like the
autobiographies in the <i>Big Book</i> don't prove that A.A. works, my personal experiences
do not prove the efficacy of coffee for anything (other than staying awake).
<p>
I suffered some real damage from alcohol. Brain cells killed, short term memory blown,
power of concentration gone. I used to be a computer programmer, but I haven't written a line
of code in five years. Those days are over. I get a headache trying to concentrate and think
that hard.
<p>
I have capillary damage which shows up as &quot;spiders&quot; in the skin and makes the color of the palms
of my hands speckled red and white. The doctor says that is some late-stage alcoholism stuff,
getting close to death there.
<p>
But my liver is in great shape. The doctor was pleasantly surprised when he looked at the
results of the lab tests for liver enzymes and blood proteins.
Everything was right in the middle of the correct
range. The doctor complained that my liver is a little enlarged, as he poked his fingers into
my belly. But no cirrhosis. The liver is just fine. I'll live forever.

<p>
So did coffee save me? That's pretty far-fetched.
<p>
My immediate reaction is that it is wishful thinking to imagine that coffee will save your liver
from alcohol. (I can just see the guys under the bridge saying, &quot;Hey pass that whiskey and latt&eacute;
over here, Jeb.&quot;)
<p>
But I've heard crazier things.
<p>
I hope they do some more really stringent studies, and figure this one out.
It is just too interesting to forget about.
<p>
And have a good day.

Date:  	Tue, June 13, 2006 10:53<br>
From:  	&quot;James G.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	I hope you respect my choice.<br>

<p>

I have been considering for sometime the future of the Blamedenial
website. It is with some sadness that I have to announce the site will
cease to be 'live' from September the 1st 2006.  I will remain
contactable until that date and I shall continue to post letters.
However from September the 1st my jamesg@Blamedenial.co.uk
 email will no longer work. I shall
then allow the time left on the server contract to run its course and
Blamedenial will 'die' when that runs out.

<p>

I have not reached this decision because I have changed my views on AA
or the 12 Steps. I have been listening to those people closest to me
that I respect and whose counsel I trust wholeheartedly. I have also
listened to myself. Being an addict is a chapter, an episode, in my life
that I want to leave behind. By continuing my work with Blamedenial I am
only keeping that alive. To borrow a phrase from our friends in AA,
Blamedenial has been a 'bridge to normal living' for me; it is not my
life, and neither can it ever be. When I made the decision to question
AA I had to hide away for three months, leaving myself at the door of
every room I walked into, and sites like the Orange Papers and my work
for Blamedenial gave me a sense of connection with people that I needed
at that vulnerable time. However this electronic medium of communication
is not what I envisage life to be about. I need to build healthy
relationships with people who I know, and do it face to face.  I never
imagined Blamedenial would have almost 12,000 visitors in the 8 weeks it
has been online. I cannot commit to this and as such I feel it is only
fair to make my intentions known before the site attracts even more
visitors. When I uploaded it for the first time I thought a couple of my
friends might view it &#8212; and that was it. I never really pushed it; it was
all our visitors that did. Thank you.

<p>

All the letters I have received, even the ones questioning this and
myself, have all served their purpose. The messages of support have
acted as a great strength to me during those bouts of horrendous self
doubt we all experience, and those that have challenged, have had the
effect of reinforcing my beliefs. My intention with the site was to act
as the UK portal for the ideas that the Orange Papers put so aptly, but
in all honesty, everything we need to know is contained within those
papers. The UK will catch on to these ideas when it is ready, and I have
a feeling that time is approaching. As selfish as this may sound, I want
to live my life now, without the label of being an addict and without
the fear (and consequently the control) that gives the people around me.
Blamedenial taught me that I did not have to say the 'right' thing to be
respected and alleviate that fear, but rather all I had to do was be
true to myself. For 9 years I have been James the addict and if I
continue to run this site, I will forever be remembered as that. I would
quite like to go back to being James. Full stop. For a time, the anger I
felt towards all the guilt that AA induced in me was my motivation for
doing this, but I have to let that go now. AA harmed me, and I am sure
it has harmed others, but I feel any victory at this stage would be a
pyrrhic one. If I can find my truth, then I have every faith that anyone
else can, provided they want to. Many of you will see this as
retreating, but it is not; it is my method of going forwards, of putting
the past where it belongs &#8212; in the past &#8212; something I have failed to do
for too long now. I feel as though I have been in conflict with either
society or myself since the age of 19 &#8212; I have been exhausted by this
fight. I want to find communion and a healthy place in this world.
Leaving rehab for the second time with all the questions surrounding my
ability to do 'this', trying to keep my head held high was not easy, but
my efforts have paid off.

<p>

My message to anyone questioning AA is still the same, believe in
yourself, believe you can do what you need to and you will achieve it.
Don't get drunk and don't get high, but you don't have to tear yourself
apart in order to achieve this. Bottom line, live! On some level the web
acts as a fantasy &#8212; I could retreat to it when I wanted and make it
whatever I needed it to be and get absorbed in that false hue of
perfection. Reality is better in my experience, despite all its faults.
Although the fact the pain is real, the pleasures are also that much
more real, and with that, they are more meaningful. There is little risk
in cyber space and if the old adage is true, and you do indeed get what
you put into life, then I need to take more risks, and these risks must
be carried out not on the web, but in reality, where the consequences
are real, and thus felt. Perhaps that is the most important lesson this
'bridge to normal living' has taught me. I am untouchable for the most
part on here, but it has never been my intention to be so; I want to
feel all the world has to show me. I have the confidence these days to
take that risk &#8212; I no longer need to hide. AA reduced my decisions to
being dictated by fear, but it is hope that influences my choices today.
And should I make a mistake, so be it; it will be mine &#8212; I am
responsible for my life again.

<p>

Thank you all for your support and I hope that you can find it in
yourselves to understand my decision.

PS All that is written above might suggest I do not agree with other
sites that do what Blamedenial intended to do, but that is not the case.
Agent Orange serves a purpose and without him I would not be free of
this. Enough said.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi James,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
I think I understand pretty well how you are feeling.
I walked away from the Orange Papers web site for almost a year,
and went and played in the sun. I now call that a phase
of &quot;recovery from recovery&quot;.
I just got tired of the negativity and the arguing about A.A., so I went and worked
on my suntan and fed a bunch of ducks and geese.

<p>
Really, do we all have to spend the rest of our lives
just talking about drinking and recovery? That is one of the problems with Alcoholics
Anonymous. We don't have to duplicate that mistake.
We can just walk out the door and get on with our lives.

<p>
Have a good life and a good time.

Subject:  	did aa ruin my life &#8212; or did i?<br>

<p>

Dear Orange:
<p>
I grew up in an alcoholic home and was indoctrinated at a very early age
w/alatot, alateen. Surprise! I'm 44 yrs old now and have been a full-blown
alcoholic for many years now. I've been to 3, 4, 5 rehabs, including
Hazelden (supposed to be the &quot; best&quot;). AA has just never worked for me.
<p>
I've had every conceivable crappy thing happen to me as far as
&quot;recovery&quot;, like I see mentioned,  Sad, very sad, and funny too. The
last rehab that I was in, the &quot;counselor&quot; made us sit and listen to
Whitney Houston records. I could go on forever.
<p>
I'm still drinking,
but just starting to seek out other ways of getting sober. Smart looks
promising. Your site has been, well, I'm speechless actually. You're
fucking brilliant. I can't thank you enough, honestly.  It always hurt so
much when I would read about some celebrity or something thanking the
heavens for AA. I always felt like such a dismal failure... Now, maybe
there really is something else. I might not be that young anymore but
maybe I dont have to die drunk and alone. I hope that its not too late
for me.
<p>
Much love, Maureen

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Maureen,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments, and congratulations on hanging in there and
fighting for your life. Yes, you can win.
<p>
Your situation isn't hopeless at all. As long as you can still get up and type a letter
on a computer, you aren't dead yet. There is still hope.
<p>
You sure don't need to feel like a failure because the A.A. program didn't work for you.
It doesn't actually work for anybody. What happens is that a few people quit drinking
by using their own self-control and will power, and then they give the credit to
A.A. while loudly yammering ridiculous nonsense about how the 12 Steps made them quit.
<p>
Yes, SMART is promising. It has a lot of good things going for it. Like that you can
tell the truth, and they will tell the truth to you, too.
(That is a big one for me.)

<p>
I also like Jack Trimpey's thing about &quot;The Beast&quot;.
(That is &quot;Rational Recovery&quot;.) I wrote up something very similar here:
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
Understanding how that little rat works has been a huge help in avoiding relapses.
<p>
As I see it, withdrawal from an addiction happens in two distinct phases.
<p>
Phase 1 is just detoxing and getting unhooked. Going through DTs, or not.
Going through all of the pain and discomfort and disorientation and anxiety.

<p>
Phase 2 is after all of the withdrawal pain stops and you are getting comfortable
in your new state. That little voice in your head starts yammering,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Oh we have it under
control now. We have a handle on it. It's been so long since we've had one; we can
have just one now, for old time's sake. It will be okay.&quot;
</font>
<p>
If you believe him, you will relapse every time.
<p>
I learned the hard way, from 30 years of quitting smoking and two times of quitting
drinking, that you can't believe a word that the lying little monster says.
He will say absolutely anything to get you to pick up a drink or a cigarette.

<p>
You mentioned that you are 44 years old. Coincidentally, you are just about exactly 10 years
younger than I was when I quit. Oh do I wish I had quit ten years earlier. Most all of the really
heavy-duty irreparable damage from alcohol happened in the last 10 years.
The damage increases exponentially as you get older. You just don't heal like you used to.
I would be in much, much better shape now,
physically, if I had quit at 44 instead of 54.
Please quit sooner, rather than later.

but you also have a regular smorgasbord of non-cult groups available for advice, help,
