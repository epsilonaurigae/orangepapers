<p>
Orange I can speak only to my experience. The AA success rate for me is 100%.. I
also read some other internet comments suggesting that you were once a problem
drinker and sobered up on your own. Congrats to you!!!
<p>
There are people who conquer many things in life all by their self.
I say that's great! After reading your comments, &quot;facts&quot;, and statistics I think
I'll just stay in the road I am on.  I kinda like what I have and how and where I
got it!

<p>
Best wishes for you!

Hello again, Michael,
<p>
I could also say that the sobriety rate from me not attending cult religion meetings is also 100%,
but I won't, because it's a misnomer. A RATE is something <i>per</i> something else,
like miles per hour, or gallons per minute, or parts per million (ppm).
The word &quot;percent&quot; means &quot;per 100&quot;.
So it is senseless to talk about the sobriety rate of one person.
It will always be either zero or 100%.
Either he is sober, or he isn't.
Percentages only work when you are talking about groups.

<p>
Yes, I had a very bad problem with drinking and smoking. It nearly killed me.
I just recently listed all of the autobiographical stories in this letter,
and you can read all of the stories there:<br>
<a href="orange-letters338.html#James_B" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters338.html#James_B</a>
<p>
Oh, and thanks for the congratulations, and congratulations to you too.

<p>
You are quite welcome to stay on the road that you are on.
I don't have a problem with that. If you are happy with your group, or your religion, so be it.
What is bad is decieving newcomers and lying to them, like Bill Wilson did in the <i>Big Book</i>,
<font color="black">&quot;RARELY have we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;</font>

<p>
Lying to sick people and telling them that A.A. is a great cure when it isn't, and he knew that it wasn't,
is evil. And heartless. But that is what Bill Wilson was:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><b>Bill Wilson</b>, at the memorial service for
Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;
file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That kind of contrasts with &quot;Rarely fails&quot;, doesn't it?
It also contrasts with the lies that he wrote in the Foreword to the Second Edition about 50% sobering up
right away, and 25% more later.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Have a good day now.

These are checks made out to pay people back who gave money to
Wilson. He said he never took money, but he did.

<p>
Mister T,
<p>
Thank you for all you do.  &quot;Newsday&quot;, a Long Island newspaper, reported on 1.18.2013
that &quot;Dear Abby&quot; advice columnist Pauline Phillips died (1918-2013).  She had
written &quot;A bad habit never disappears miraculously; it's an undo-it-yourself project
&quot;.   I believe that applies to alcohol-abuse.  I have been sober and clean since
10.27.1980  minus Jesus and the 12 steps.  I have also been reading and watching
videos of Christopher Hitchens work with great interest and pleasure.  I am sure you
know his writings  and wonder if you have, or have made,  any comments on his work?

<p>
Peace and Love.<br>
Long Island Bob O.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bob,
<p>
Yes, the passing of both Ann Landers and Abby is the end of an era. Abby didn't seem to be as devoted
to A.A.
<a href="orange-letters143.html#Ebert" target="_blank">as Ann Landers was</a>.
Abby's quote about bad habits seems right on.

<p>
Congratulations on your many years of freedom from both alcohol and cults.
<p>
I love Christopher Hitchens. It's fun to watch him tweak the noses of the true believers.
Come to think of it, I need to check out some of his books from the library again.
The last time I did, I couldn't finish them because they were so popular that other people
put holds on them and yanked them away from me before I was done.

Have a good day now.

Yes, thanks for the link.

<a href="orange-bibliography.html#smashed" target="_blank">Koren Zailckas's book, <i>Smashed; Story of a Drunken Girlhood</i></a>
and changed the story to insert A.A. into the plot. Koren wrote in her
autobiographical story of staying smashed
all through high school and college that she did not consider herself an alcoholic and never went to an
A.A. meeting. She just drank while it was fun and then quit drinking when it got
to be too expensive and messed with the life that she wanted.
<p>
This story appears to be completely different, and has nothing to do with Koren's biography.
And yes, it sounds like cult recruiting &#8212; some more of the &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot;
that A.A. does.

I wonder how they are getting away with stealing the name of Koren's book.

Subject:  	Sources<br>

<p>
Hi there.

<p>
Recently I discovered that a person who was &quot;helping&quot; me, who had
directed me to AA and was my self-proclaimed &quot;spiritual adviser,&quot; had
actually been using thought reform. He had also convinced me that he
was a demonologist and empath who could read my thoughts, and that &quot;a
demon was on my path.&quot; I spent many months with my life being
consumed, sleep- and food-deprived, as well as socially isolated. At
first, I thought maybe he was just a nut, a psychopath, really
believed what he was saying, perhaps. Now, I'm beginning to question
AA itself, which led me to your site.

<p>
After being lied to and misled for so long, I want to be able to 1)
recover my mental capacity for critical thinking and 2) learn more and
decide for myself what I think. One thing that I feel would help me
tremendously is knowing where information is coming from, so I was
curious about whether or not you had a list of sources. I see you have
a lot of documents posted, but are there links to where they were
found or something along those lines? Please take no offense, I simply
want to be sure that the information is credible and that I can cross-reference it.

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Taryn,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about the nightmare that you have been
going through, but I'm happy to hear that you are getting out of it.
<p>
Yes, I list all of my sources. The bibliography is rather long, and it lists both pro- and anti-A.A.
books and articles. It actually starts with the A.A. &quot;Big Book&quot;:<br>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-bibliography.html</a>
<p>
And there are links back to the original articles whereever that is possible.
Of course things that have not been posted on the Internet will not have links.
<p>
You can also see the links page for a zillion links to relevant things:<br>
<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-links.html</a>
<p>
Since you are interested in developing some critical thinking, may I recommend some non-cult
recovery groups, like SMART or SOS or WFS? SMART in particular teaches just such thinking skills.
Here is the list:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>

<p>
Also, here is a web page which gives a good, very short, description of
&quot;brainwashing&quot; and &quot;thought reform&quot; techniques, as described
by Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer, and Dr. Edgar H. Schein.<br>
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">http://orange-papers.info/orange-cultinfo.html</a>

<p>
There is also a section of the bibliography that specifically lists books on
<b>Mind Control, Brainwashing, Other Psychology, and Propaganda</b>:<br>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#brainwashing" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-bibliography.html#brainwashing</a>

If you add it to your site, I will gladly send you a signed copy if you want when I
have more, but it will take awhile, because I have to pay for them, though at a
discount, and order a minimum of five.

<p>
I lived in Portland in 1990 &amp; 1991, and think I know about the treatment center you
mentioned in your autobiography. I lived fairly near there, on SW Oak between 3rd &amp;
4th. I used to go to an AA meeting on Burnside and I think some of the new people
went to that center, because they mentioned getting acupuncture. I didn't really
notice, though, what success rate they had in staying sober compared to those who
didn't get acupuncture.

<p>
I find your site very interesting, and appreciate the tremendous amount of work that
must have been involved!

<p>
Best wishes,<br>

Hello Liz,
<p>
Thanks for the information. I wish you luck with your book. I'll give you a plug now,
and
<a href="orange-links.html#Purcell" target="_blank">add your book to the links page</a>,
but I really do have to read the book and like it before I can add it to the &quot;Top 10&quot; list.
I'll see if the local library has it. (And sure, I wouldn't mind a signed copy eventually.)

<p>
So have a good day now.

Subject:  	Orange Paper site and AA articles...<br>

<p>
Hello,
<p>
I do not know your name for it is not mentioned on your site but I have to tell
you I stumbled upon your site and found your articles about AA/NA to be very eye
opening, informative and frankly I agree with everything you had to say about
how they make their money, cult-like characteristics hidden and kept secret as
the motive behind getting people to stay only to fill their ego's and pockets.
<p>
I have a site as well and have recently wrote a book on how I feel recovery
needs to be more and what made me leave AA.  I am a recovering Alcoholic for 19
plus years and have even written articles on how I truly see AA.  I was told by
my publisher and by others when writing my book to be careful of what I say and
how I share my opinions of AA because no one would be interested in my book or
want to buy it.  Seems like the cult got to them as well.
<p>
Anyways, I am glad to
have found you and your words of truth and honesty and hope to hear more from
you.  Are you on Facebook?  Twitter?  Love to connect somehow.
<p>
Thanks,<br>
Cathy

Hello Cathy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations for getting it together and staying sober.
<p>
Starting at the top, yes, I've printed my birth name on the web site
a few times, here and there. It is Terrance Hodgins, and I live in rural Oregon now.
<p>
About writing a book about recovery without A.A., coincidentally, the previous letter that I got
is from another woman who wrote on the same subject, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters340.html#Liz" target="_blank">
 http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters340.html#Liz</a>
<p>
Apparently, the subject is a lot more popular than your publisher realizes.
It seems like a whole lot of people are interested. Incidentally, the Orange Papers web site
is
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/webstats" target="_blank">getting 2.6 million hits per month now</a>,
so a lot of people are interested in the subject of recovery without A.A.

<p>
Tell me about your book and I'll give you a plug too.

<p>
I am on Facebook as &quot;Orange.Papers&quot;. (&quot;Orange&quot; was already taken.)
And a nice young woman started a Facebook group for me, and it is &quot;Orange Papers&quot;
(without the period).

<p>
Have a good day now.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Edy,
<p>
No, &quot;IT&quot; does not work. You said so.  In your last letter, you said,
<font color="black">
&quot;AA is NOT a treatment program, it's a self-help group...&quot;</font>
Well, since A.A. isn't a treatment program, it cannot be due the credit for making people quit drinking.
A.A. cannot be due the credit for &quot;curing alcoholism&quot;.
The people who help themselves are due the credit, not &quot;IT&quot; or
&quot;A.A.&quot;, or &quot;The Steps&quot;, or &quot;The Program&quot;.
<p>
When you see a few people quit drinking, you just assume that your favorite cult
religion is due the credit. But you don't really know why those people quit drinking.
They may have quit drinking because
<a href="orange-jokes.html#Dr_Ngobo" target="_blank">they secretly practice Voodoo and worship
Damballah and Legbah and Bon Dieu as their &quot;Higher Powers&quot;</a>.
Now that is a ridiculous example, of course, but you still don't know.
<p>
Even if they tell you that they quit because they practiced
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">the occult practices of Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>,
that proves nothing except that they are gullible and confused.
<p>
The real reason why most people quit drinking is because the pain of drinking alcohol 
 gets to be too much, and drinking gets to be too expensive (more in terms of life
than of money), so they quit drinking and get a better lifestyle.

<p>
And of course,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">every time A.A. was tested in valid
clinical tests, it was proven to be a failure</a>.
Even an extremely pro-A.A. doctor who was trying hard to prove that A.A. works &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. George Vaillant</a> who
went on to become a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; proved that A.A. totally fails to make
alcoholics quit drinking.

<p>
The only thing that works is people deciding to quit drinking, and then really doing it
by using their own will power and self-reliance. Yes,
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#no_self_reliance" target="_blank">that will power and self-reliance that Bill Wilson said you can't have any of</a>.

<p>
So now you are going to go hang out with &quot;tons&quot; of friends? How much do your group members weigh?

<p>
The fact that you have a few sober friends does not prove that A.A. works.
That is classic <a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>.
<p>
And why don't you go hang out with some sober people who quit drinking without A.A.?
There are 10 times as many sober people who quit drinking without A.A. as with.
Well, the reason that you don't, and the reason that you won't, is that you want to hang
out with people who will repeat your favorite superstitions back at you.

<p>
And actually, you are being judgemental. You automatically reject and ignore
all evidence that contradicts your favorite cult religion beliefs.
The name for that is &quot;pre-judging&quot;, or &quot;prejudice&quot;.
And &quot;<a href="Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf" target="_blank">contempt prior to investigation</a>&quot;.

Have a good day.

Subject:  	Re: Fallacy<br>

<p>
You have so many misconceptions.  its obvious that you have contempt prior to
investigation.  Do you even know what a &quot;program&quot; consists of?  I bet not cause it
has as much to do with the seen as the unseen.  If AA is a cult, who is our
charismatic leader?  Bill W. is dead, by tradition, the cult dies when it's leader
dies.  What about NA, they don't follow the big book of AA.  I participate in CA...
I hang out with all kinds of people alcoholic or not, AA associated or not.  Where
do all the non-AA drinkers hang out?  I'd love to meet them.  I was a single mother
of two who had been using for 15 years where else could I have found a group of
friends that support me not continuing to live the life I lived and teach me how to
live differently?  Certainly not my addict parents.  It's not a program out of any
book per se, it a group of people who have experience in changing their lives and
perspective.  Miracles are not able to be documented by science.  It's principles
are common amongst every good hearted human being- only at one time I was not able
to live by my own values and principles, today I do more often than not.  It IS a
program selfishness, setting boundaries and defending our sobriety at any cost.
Then once we have some solution on how to live our lives within those common
principles we GET to help others.  Seeing others find a sober way of life brings me
more joy than your bashing what works for some people.  It's our choice and you have
not answered my question of what you get out of bashing 12-steps?  What concern is
it of yours where other people find their answers?  I would guess you had a parent
who struggled with addiction that &quot;ruined your life&quot;.  OR you are the sort who has
to defend you ongoing use and disfunction.  Sounds grand.  Better you than me.

Hello again Edy,

Thanks for the reply.  Well, starting at the top:

<p>
Contempt prior to investigation? No, it's contempt <i>AFTER</i> investigation.
Look at the bibliography for the Orange Papers, here:<br>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-bibliography.html</a>
<p>
You will see that the bibliography begins with all of the A.A. council-approved books
that I've been able to get my hands on, and it's a lot of them. And the N.A. books
are listed there too.
<p>
So how many anti-A.A. or anti-N.A. or anti-12-Step books have you read?
Have you spent the last 12 years studying
the reports from doctors who tested the 12-Step programs to see whether they really work?
Have you actually investigated at all?
<p>
What you have is belief before investigation.

<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>

Yes, I know what &quot;the program&quot; consists of.
Try these pages:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps Interpreted</a>
<li> <a href="orange-traditions.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Traditions Interpreted</a>

<li> <a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank"><i>&quot;It's Spiritual, Not Religious&quot;</i></a>
</ul>

<p><li>
This is totally wrong:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If AA is a cult, who is our charismatic leader?  Bill W. is dead, by tradition,

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nonsense.
Need I mention Scientology, the Hari Krishnas, the Moonies, and the Mormons?
Their charismatic leaders died, and they are still in business.
Even Jim Jones' People's Temple, and Heaven's Gate, and the
Branch Davidians still have surviving churches and convinced
true believers. 
Still, even now. Even after the mass suicides and all of the deaths, those
idiots still worship their dead founders.
Some people just never learn.
<p>
Unfortunately, cults do not necessarily die out when the charismatic cult leader dies.
Some do, and some don't.
And A.A. didn't.

<p><li>
This is more nonsense:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
What about NA, they don't follow the big book of AA.  I participate in CA...<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The N.A. book, &quot;How It Works&quot;, is just a clone of the A.A. &quot;Big Book&quot;.
You can put the two of them on the table side by side, and go through them
chapter by chapter, and see that they say the same things in the same chapters.
(I've done that.)
The N.A. book just substitutes words like &quot;drugs&quot; and
&quot;addiction&quot; for &quot;alcohol&quot;
and &quot;alcoholism&quot;. Both books sell the same crazy program of
&quot;God will save you if you confess enough and surrender.&quot;

<p><li>
You said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I hang out with all kinds of people alcoholic or not, AA associated or not.  Where
do all the non-AA drinkers hang out?  I'd love to meet them.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is good that you have a wide circle of friends. The non-A.A. non-drinkers are everywhere
and anywhere.
They don't have any one hang-out place like cult members do.

<p>
Me, you will often find me at the wetlands feeding the geese, or at the public library,
or at the supermarket or other stores, or at the farmers market, or just &quot;around&quot;.
<p>
Us non-cult non-drinkers do not have a clubhouse where we recite slogans at each other.

<p><li>
About this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

book per se, it a group of people who have experience in changing their lives and
perspective.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now you are talking about N.A. as a social club. The fact that you enjoy socializing
with N.A. members does not prove or in any way indicate that the 12-Step program
isn't a fraud and a cult religion and medical malpractice.
<p>
And that says nothing about the actual recovery rate.
What percentage of the newcomers pick up a glow-in-the-dark 1-year keytag?
(I did. I've still got mine.)
<p>
Congratulations for getting your life together and quitting your addictions, in spite
of getting some bad advice and crazy religious nonsense.

<p><li>
Sorry, but this is sheer bullshit:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Miracles are not able to be documented by science.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The A.A. and N.A. programs are not &quot;miracles&quot;. They are hoaxes that fool the gullible.
<p>
It is very, very easy to &quot;scientifically&quot; determine the success rate of A.A. and N.A.:
Just count heads. See how many of the newcomers are clean and sober after 1 year.
And see how many are still doping or in prison or dead.
<p>
Then compare those numbers to the numbers
that you get from examining a similar bunch of alcoholics and addicts who got no
such &quot;12-Step help&quot;.  When that was done, the results were always that
the 12-Step program does not get people clean and sober.


<p><li>
This is more standard 12-Step cult dogma:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It's principles
are common amongst every good hearted human being- only at one time I was not able
to live by my own values and principles, today I do more often than not.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
A.A. and N.A. have no &quot;principles&quot;. They have cult religion practices like surrender
to something, and confess your sins to your sponsor, and conduct a s&eacute;ance and
imagine that you are &quot;channeling&quot; God.
Those are not spiritual principles that are common to all good religions.
They are superstitions and cult practices.
Spiritual principles are things like,
<ul>
<li> Those shalt not lie.
<li> Thou shalt not steal.
<li> Thou shalt not commit adultery. (No 13th-Stepping.)
<li> Thou shalt not commit murder.
<li> Those shalt not deceive others in order to get them to join your religion.
<li> <b>Honesty is the best policy.</b>
 (As opposed to, &quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">Dole out the truth by teaspoons, not buckets</a>.&quot;)
</ul>

<p><li>
This is a standard 12-Step cult slogan:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It IS a program selfishness, setting boundaries and defending our sobriety at any cost.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's great that you refuse to take another hit of drugs, but refusing to see the truth
or speak the truth is not &quot;defending your sobriety&quot;. It is defending your illusions.

<p><li>
Then you said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then once we have some solution on how to live our lives within those common
principles we GET to help others.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Meaning, after you have been properly indoctrinated in the 12-Step cult religion,
you go recruiting.

<p><li>
You said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Seeing others find a sober way of life brings me
more joy than your bashing what works for some people.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree that it is wonderful to see people stop killing themselves and get healthy.
So what is your success rate? How much does N.A. really help?
Out of each 100 newcomers, how many get a glow-in-the-dark
keytag a year later? No excuses are allowed, like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They didn't work the program right.
They didn't try hard enough. They didn't surrender. They didn't keep coming back.&quot;
</font>
Everybody counts.
What is the real recovery rate when you count everybody?

<p><li>
Then you asked,
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
What concern is it of yours where other people find their answers?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's the problem: the 12-Step cult religion does not have any answers to offer. It does not
work. It is a fraud and a hoax. Just another crazy cult religion.
It hurts more people than it helps. It decieves people and makes recovery more difficult.

<p><li>
Then you finished with
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">the standard cultish
 <i>ad hominem</i> attack</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I would guess you had a parent who struggled with addiction that &quot;ruined
your life&quot;.  OR you are the sort who has to defend you ongoing use and
disfunction.  Sounds grand.  Better you than me.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Can you explain how me having an alcoholic father improves or worsens the A.A. and N.A.
failure rates? If my father had been sober, would that make A.A. and N.A. work better now?
Those things have nothing to do with each other.
You are just trying to find some bad reason for someone saying some true things that
you don't wish to hear.
<p>
I'm happy to report that there is no &quot;ongoing use and disfunction&quot;.
I have 12 years clean and sober now. Not even a cigarette in 12 years. How are you doing there?

<p>
Have a good day now.

You may actually prevent someone finding their solution to their substance abuse
problem.

<p>
I don't have a problem with objectivity, I have a problem with someone printing and
promoting information that is so polarized.

<p>
It has worked. For a number of people. It is a mental health disorder.

<p>
I object to the manner in which you &quot;report&quot; your information. It's negative and has
the potential to cause harm.

Hello again, Mary,
<p>
Well, once again a Stepper claims that telling the truth about A.A. is &quot;harming&quot; alcoholics,
and preventing them from &quot;finding a solution&quot;.
(Welcome to
<a href="orange-disservice.html" target="_blank">the list</a>.)

<p>
A.A. does not work.
You have not provided any evidence that A.A. works.
Just pointing at a few people who quit drinking proves nothing.
You don't know why they quit. For all you know, they may have quit drinking because they
secretly worship Donald Duck as their &quot;Higher Power&quot;.

<p>
When you say,
<font color="black">&quot;It has worked. For a number of people.&quot;</font>,
that is just an attempt at
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#testimonials" target="_blank">Proof by Testimonials</a>, and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof By Anecdote</a>.
That's like saying,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Joe Blow was sick as a dog until he drank three bottles of
Dr. Bummer's Green Tree Snake Elixir, and he immediately got over the flu. So that
Dr. Bummer really makes great medicine. It really works.&quot;</font>
As a registered nurse, you should know that the FDA rejects testimonials and anecdotes
immediately.

Such testimonials and anecdotal stories are just the uninformed
opinions of some people with no medical training or experience or knowledge of how
to properly perform clinical tests and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">separate causality from coincidence</a>.

Only
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>
are acceptable to the FDA as evidence of efficacy.
<p>

In fact, you have ignored and dodged all questions about the effectiveness of A.A. as a
treatment or a &quot;solution&quot; to the problem of alcohol abuse.
You complained that I quote doctors' reports about how A.A. does not work.
You have even ignored the words of a doctor and professor at your own University of Virginia.
<p>
Since A.A. does not work, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">actually does more harm than good</a>,
my criticizing A.A. cannot possibly be preventing people from
finding solutions to their substance-abuse problems.
<p>
Then you claimed that &quot;It is a mental health disorder&quot;,
without defining what &quot;it&quot; was. Your previous &quot;it&quot; referred
to the A.A. program: &quot;It has worked.&quot; Nevertheless, I understand what
you mean, if you were referring to alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
I have to agree that Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Dependency are mental illnesses.
Alcohol Abuse is mental illness number 305.00 in the DSM-IV, the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. And Alcohol Dependency is
303.90. Here is the relevant page:
<p>
<center>
<a href="orange-DSM-IV-195.png" target="DSMwin">
<img src="http://orange-papers.info/orange-DSM-IV-195.png" width="900" height="1444" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" alt="DSM-IV page 195"></a>
</center>
<p>
In addition, many, if not most, cases of alcohol abuse are actually caused by underlying mental
disorders like PTSD, or Bipolar Disorder, or Schizophrenia, or Asperger's Syndrome, or child abuse, or
clinical depression.
So when did you get trained and licensed to be a psychiatrist?
How many of your fellow A.A. members and sponsors are trained and licensed to practice psychiatry?
Aren't you and your fellow A.A. members guilty of practicing medicine without a license?

<p>
You arrogantly assume that you, a registered nurse, know more about medicine than half a dozen doctors,
and you ignore and reject what they are saying, and
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea" target="_blank">insist that your cult has a better way</a>.
Didn't Bill Wilson say something about how you need your ego reduced?
Where is that A.A. &quot;humility&quot;? What happened to
<font color="black">&quot;We realize we know only a little.&quot;</font> (<i>Big Book</i>, page 164.)

<p>
Furthermore, medical law says that the patients must be fully informed so that they can give informed
consent. Hiding the truth about &quot;The Program&quot; is unethical.
I know that Bill Wilson taught that you should only dole out the truth about A.A. by
&quot;<a href="orange-recruit.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">teaspoons, not buckets</a>&quot;,
but that is grossly unethical and just plain wrong.
That is cultish
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">Deceptive Recruiting</a>.

<p>
You object to information that is &quot;so polarized&quot;? Nonsense. I'm just reporting the truth,
something that you are trying very hard to avoid, like how you avoided all questions in
the previous two letters.

<p>
You complained,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I object to the manner in which you &quot;report&quot; your information. It's negative and has
the potential to cause harm.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh really? Well, can you tell me the &quot;positive&quot; way to explain to people that A.A. is lying to
them and selling them an old fascist cult religion from the nineteen-thirties as a quack cure for
alcohol and drug problems?

<p>
Have a good day now.

Again, I see that you have not answered a single question that I asked in previous letters.
You keep on asserting that the 12-Step religion works as a cure for drug and

And you refuse to answer the doctors who found that the 12-Step program does not work.

Subject:  	Jane Brody's column, NY Times re: addiction treatment<br>
<p>
Hi Terry,
<p>
How are you? Hope you're having a great 2013.

<p>
So check out this article by Jane Brody, the long-time health-writer for the NY
Times. It's what we've all been saying for years.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005257/http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/effective-addiction-treatment/?src=me&amp;ref=general" target="_blank">
http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/effective-addiction-treatment/?src=me&amp;ref=general</a>

<p>
The entire article is great but I particularly love this paragraph:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The Columbia report found that most addiction treatment providers are not medical
professionals and are not equipped with the knowledge, skills or credentials needed
to provide the full range of evidence-based services, including medication and
psychosocial therapy. The authors suggested that such insufficient care could be
considered 'a form of medical malpractice.' &quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Wow...can you believe this? All those crazy sponsors....
<p>
Bill

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the link. Yes, that's good.
<p>
My reaction is, &quot;Professional? Equipped with knowledge or skills?&quot; 
You've got to be joking.

<p>
The fraud and quackery that is passed off as &quot;treatment for
addictions&quot; is almost unbelievable.
My so-called &quot;counselor&quot; at the Portland Alternative Addiction Center
(PAAC) was 
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Christina" target="_blank">a coke-snorting child-raper</a>
who yammered 12-Step slogans at us:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I am teachable today. I don't know if I will relapse tomorrow.
Your addiction wants to kill you.
You need a Higher Power in your recovery program.
Go to at least three meetings a week and get a sponsor.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And to think that the
Oregon Health Plan paid $1700 per person for alcoholics and addicts to get
that &quot;treatment program&quot;.
<p>
As you can imagine, that &quot;treatment&quot; had nearly a 100% failure rate.
<a href="orange-letters20.html#survivor" target="_blank">I'm the only one that I know of in my group</a>
(of between 100 and 200 people)
who didn't relapse, and I'm the guy who quit drinking
and drugging two weeks before the program started.
And I quit because I decided that I didn't want to die that way, not because I
was in a &quot;treatment program&quot;.
<p>
And yes, it most assuredly is medical malpractice to foist that fraud on sick people.
<p>
This paragraph also rang a bell:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Often, Ms. Fletcher found, low-cost, publicly funded clinics have better-qualified therapists and better outcomes than the high-end residential centers typically used by celebrities like Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan. Indeed, their revolving-door experiences with treatment helped prompt Ms. Fletcher's exhaustive exploration in the first place.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, those repeatedly-relapsing celebrities reveal that the 12-Step program doesn't really work at all.
That's why Bill Wilson wanted everyone to be anonymous, especially the celebrities,
and never publicly reveal their membership in A.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;It would be harmful if the Fellowship promoted itself
by publicizing, through the media of radio and TV, the
sobriety of well-known public personalities who became
members of AA. If these personalities happened to
have slips, outsiders would think our movement is not
strong and they might question the veracity of the
miracle of the century.&quot;<br>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>The miracle of the century?</i></font> Bill Wilson sure did have 
a high opinion of his quackery.

<p>
Have a good day now.
