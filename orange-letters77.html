Hi AO,

<p>

I like the website, although it's only for free thinkers.  Solider ants that
fall in line won't like it.
<p>
Anyway, I found a typo on your site at :
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-powerless.html.
&quot;Now you're GETTING it&quot;
or &quot;Now you've GOTTEN it&quot; ?

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Other A.A.-booster literature tells stories like:<br>
I said to my sponsor, &quot;I really can't do this.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Good.&quot;<br>
I said, &quot;No, I mean, I really can't do this, all of the quitting and staying
quit, and total abstinence. I just don't have it in me to succeed in a
program like that.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Now you've getting it! That's what the program is all about. You
must admit that you are powerless over alcohol.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
Yes, I think it is &quot;getting it&quot;, present tense. The sponsor wasn't going to tell the
sponsee that he had already learned it all, now was he?
<p>
The sponsor was only going to give the newcomer credit for having learned one little part of it,
so far...
The newcomer still had lots more to &quot;get&quot;.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi again, James,
<p>
Thanks for the links. More good stuff.
<p>
And the weather here is just now turning rainy. We are still getting alternating rainy and
sunny days. The days are getting cool, but not cold. I was still out in a T-shirt and shorts
last weekend.
<p>
Here in the Pacific Northwest, we have the advantage of the Pacific Current &#8212;
which brings warm water up from Mexico and Central America, which heats the place
and keeps the winters from getting too cold.
<p>
The Pacific Current is
a giant counter-clockwise circular current that covers the entire northern half of the Pacific Ocean &#8212;
north from Mexico to Alaska, west to Japan, south to the Philippines, east to Central America.
While it is warming us, it is freezing the buns off of the Japanese, bringing them frigid Alaskan
water. Poor Japan. Lucky us.
<p>
There is a similar current in the North Atlantic, but I'm not sure how it works.
If it also swirls counter-clockwise, which is likely, then it is warming you too. But England
is actually much farther north than the USA is. So I can see how it could already be cold there.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway &#8212; in some warm place.

Subject:  	Friends of Grace Slick<br>

<p>
Hello Orange

<p>
Hope you are well.  Writing you from new yahoo email, we've corresponded before, if
you recall
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Gracie">we discussed Grace Slick</a>.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Twitter. It's good to see that you are doing well.
</font>
<p>

Anyway, I am still detoxing from the cult.  It's going on a year since I have
attended.  I occassionally run into the zombies, but I manage to keep them
pleasantly at a distance.  Suggested one or two read the orange papers, so here's
hoping they leave zombie land behind.

<p>
I went on a 12 step chat to twit the true believers today, because I'm really bored.
I don't miss the drams and cult bs, and I get really annoyed thinking about the
years when I was younger and had more energy and could have gotten involved in a lot
more things, instead of being shit on by the true believers and abused by criminals.
I have a lot of guilt about why I would do such a stupid thing to myself, product
of the dysfunctional family repeating history yada, yada.  The other day, I was
worried about something (I forget what, I was half asleep, maybe I was dreaming) and
I started looking at the problem in the aa framework, I think I was automatically
doing a sixth step or something, like I was still &quot;trying&quot; the program, it was a
very surreal experience.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, dump the guilt right now. It wasn't your fault. You couldn't have done anything else because
you didn't know anything else at that time. And the Stepper true believers sure wouldn't tell you
anything different, would they? Did they?
<p>
So dump the guilt and just accept that <i>that</i> was just the way that things were then.
<p>
Look on the bright side. You escaped from the madhouse. They didn't.
</font>

<p>
I find a lot of people out of the program just as nutty, and some of them are just
religeous zombies of another ilk.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I learned that one the hard way years ago when I got shredded by some <i>ex-steppers</i>.
Just because someone quits A.A. does not necessarily mean that he has been &quot;restored to sanity&quot;.
<p>
That's where I am more and more seeing the wisdom of
<a href="orange-top10.html#Trimpey2">Jack Trimpey</a>
when he tells people to get out of the recovery groups and build a
new set of friendships based on shared positive things, rather
than on shared illnesses.
</font>
<p>

Some phony Christian in a literature group went
off on her religion, I almost threw up, it was like having a flashback to the cult
and I was afraid of being abused for being a human being and not a cult zombie.  At
least I was not in a roomful of enemies.  THAT is progress.  I got together with an
ex (let's just call him Bozo) a couple of times who is still in the cult.  He enjoys
the comraderie of his fellow sexist pig Bill W wannabes and the opportunity to pick
up confused, emotionally damaged women who can temporarily be duped into thinking
he's a nice guy.  At least I have real friends now who say &quot;Just stay away from that
loser&quot; as oppposed to being hit with a lot of BS about &quot;my part&quot; and &quot;being kind to
him the fellow sufferer&quot; and &quot;pray&quot; about it, etc., although I hate to say that
stuff crosses my mind and makes things that much more difficult.
Brainwashing is a powerful thing.
<p>
I gotta get a life, Orange.  I don't want to be here waiting next time Bozo pops
around again because he's bored, too.  It's not easy, but at least I'm not going
back to the cult for company and being abused for it.  It's too bad the zombies
clutter up your site with all their bs, it's clear they haven't even read the Orange
Papers, they must have a group that gets together once a week to send you stupid
e-mails.  I prefer the letter from the escapees, I like to hear they are doing
better without the cult and enjoying the more positive things life has to offer.

<p>
<font color="blue">
All true, but the email from the nutcases is also so educational. I remember one letter from
a guy who said he was quitting A.A. because of the hate mail that I got.
<p>
And I warn the readers, &quot;If you go to A.A., you might get this nut for your sponsor,
posing as your spiritual mentor and telling you how to live.&quot;

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

The following is an e-mail I just sent to some of the anchors at Court TV.  I'd been
explaining chronically manic personalities to them for some time, and some
(especially one in particular!) have responded very favorably.  One of those whom
both I, and that other Court TV anchor very familiar with chronically manic
personalities, have had a great rapport on this, is Lisa Bloom, the daughter of
Gloria Allred.  Lisa is also one of those who got this e-mail.

Subject: What's With All the Alkies in Congress?<br>

<p>

Regarding Ney's announcement that he's in treatment for alcoholism, as well as
Patrick Kennedy and Mark Foley recently going into treatment, this really does make
me wonder how many of our congressmen are under the influence when on the job!  As
Abe Lincoln (who was one of Us) said, &quot;I believe if we take habitual drunkards as a
class, their heads and their hearts will bear an advantageous comparison with those
of any other class.  There seems ever to have been proneness in the brilliant and
warm-blooded to fall into this vice,&quot; so chances are that the smart people in
Congress are unusually likely to be alkies.
<p>
Therefore, it just might be reasonable
to enact mandatory random drug testing for them, to test for blood alcohol
concentration when they're on the job!  After all, plenty of high-consequence jobs
have mandatory drug-testing simply because of the high consequences.  Probably the
percentage of nuclear power plant operators who are alkies, is a lot less than the
percentage of congressmen who are, yet the nuclear power plant operators are
randomly tested.  If so many congressmen are helpless victims of their disease of
alcoholism, then this would be a good thing, to save plenty more congressmen from
this victimization.

Thank you, Sharen, that is priceless. How I would love to see all of the Senators and

It's only fair. Millions of lives hang in the balance.
Drunk Congressmen kill a lot more people than drunk airline pilots do.
I mean, we just can't allow whiskey-guzzling,

From:  	&quot;john m.&quot; <br>

<p>
Just curious. If someone with a drug or alcohol addiction goes to any other type of
method of quiting, such as AVERT, and does not stay sober, does that mean that they
did not practice 'a program?' Does this mean that the other methods to get sober,
are really only cults in diguise?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
AVRT (<a href="orange-top10.html#Trimpey2">Addictive Voice Recognition Therapy</a>)
cannot be a cult for a whole lot of reasons, starting with
the fact that there are no meetings and no groups.
AVRT is also not &quot;a program&quot;.
It is a technique for watching your own mind and recognizing the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">base-brain addiction monster</a>
yammering at you and trying to talk you into drinking or doping or smoking or over-eating, or whatever.
&#8212;And then refuting his arguments, and saying &quot;No&quot; to the urge to indulge.

<p>
For a more complete description of what constitutes a cult, see
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>.
<p>
So other modalities or methods for treating or dealing with alcoholism (or drug addiction)
are not &quot;really only cults in diguise&quot;.

<p>
Now talking about failure rates is valid. If we send 1000 alcoholics to A.A.,
and 1000 to AVRT training sessions,
and 1000 to SMART classes, then it is fair and valid to later ask what percentage of the alcoholics quit
drinking in each of those modalities.
<p>
It is also fair and valid to compare their success rates to the success
rate of another group of alcoholics who got no &quot;help&quot;,
&quot;treatment&quot;, or &quot;support groups&quot;, to see how many of them
got themselves sober, alone, on their own, and how much
better than normal spontaneous remission any &quot;method&quot; or
&quot;modality&quot; really is.

<p>
Have a good day.

like sending you all these emails.

<P>
However, in defense of myself, I would like you to see this video (Stockholm
Syndrome) because I think it is important. I have been on the NA forum on
Yahoo and I have stuck to the facts without getting personal, and in a way I
think they have shot themselves in the foot.

<P>
Anyway it should be getting cold there now so I hope that means I get to
hear more from you.

<P>
Hope you are well and thanks as always.

Subject:  	propaganda and debating techniques<br>

<p>

Hello again Terrance, greetings from Gordon in Glasgow, Scotland.
<p>
I have an addition
to your marvellous list of techniques, it's called the &quot;opposite test&quot;.
When someone makes a claim, ask yourself: would anyone, in any circumstances, ever
say the opposite? If not, the claim is vacuous and irrelevant.
<p>
For example, &quot;my higher power keeps me from drinking&quot;. Since nobody would say, &quot;my
higher power makes me drink&quot;, the claim is meaningless.
<p>
Another example, politicians say things like, &quot;I stand for optimism&quot;. What rival
politician is going to fearlessly lay claim to pessimism!!

<p>

Best regards, Keep up the good work, hope to meet you some day, Gordon.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Gordon,
<p>
The opposite test. Yes, that is good. I'll definitely have to add that.
<p>
Thanks and have a good day.

Date:  	Mon, October 16, 2006 4:57 am<br>
From:  	philip<br>
Subject: Questions?<br>

<p>

I am writing to you from Amsterdam.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, Philip,
<p>
It's good to hear from Amsterdam. Nice city. I was only there once, but I liked it.
All of the Netherlands was a real joy. I especially remember the Kukenhoff Gardens,
and the best cup of coffee that I ever got. (That was 1964, and I still remember that coffee.)
</font>
<p>

My girlfriend of 2 years has been attending A.A. meetings and been sober
for just over a month now. I am really happy and encouraged by this. Prior
to her attending AA we were both drinking regularly and she does now admit
to being a alcoholic. I will only admit to being a &quot;heavy&quot; drinker myself
(is that denial?) and have not joined AA, having only attending one open
meeting with my girlfriend. I have happily stopped drinking to support my
girlfriend and am having no difficulties or desires to start drinking
again.

<p>

I am really thankful that since joining AA my girlfriend has managed to so
far stay sober. I do attribute this to the fact that she has found a
social group to provide her with moral support she needs. I think her
motivation is not so much to attend meetings &#8212; which she is happy to do
everyday &#8212; but the social (non-alcoholic) drinks she has afterwards with
her new friends. She has not yet started &quot;working the steps&quot; and I
question whether her character and personality will be sincere or honest
enough to do this properly?

<p>

However, from the outset I have had an uneasy feeling about the AA and its
methods. This has driven me to trawl the internet to find out more about
treatments for alcoholics and the AA program in particular. I think it is
important to listen (read) to viewpoints from both opposite sides of the
spectrum &#8212; and from the moderates in the middle &#8212; so that a balanced
opinion can be reached. As such it seems my own leaning is towards
becoming &quot;anti&quot; AA.

<p>

With the above in mind I would like to ask you a few questions;

<p>

(playing Devils Advocate)<br>
Members attending AA meetings do seem to achieve long periods of a
abstinence &#8212; 3 months, 6 months, 1 year even 3 years. Even if they do
eventually &quot;fall off the wagon&quot; (and binge drink in quantities acceding
those before AA attendance), is not these periods of abstinence better for
the alcoholic than if they were to continue drinking?

<p>
<a name="quit2"> </a>
<font color="blue">
The periods of sobriety are good, very good,
but there are &quot;gotchas&quot;. The biggest problem that I see is that
quitting a second or a third time is much harder than the first. It's like you exhaust your
motivation for quitting each time you quit. What works to make you quit once may not work twice.
So anything that leads people to relapse could be very bad.

<p>
People quit for various reasons, like that they are horrified at seeing how the alcoholism is progressing,
blackouts, sickness, shame, lost jobs, messed-up relations, and so on. But after a while the horrifying
things are no longer so scary. What made me quit drinking the first time wasn't enough to get me
to quit drinking a second time. I had gotten used to those things, and accepted them, and kept on drinking.
Things had to get <i>much worse</i> for me to quit the second time.

<p>
For example, earlier in my drinking career, I was horrified to see myself slipping into blackouts.
The morning after, I was afraid of what I might have done, that I couldn't remember. Years later, after
quitting and staying sober for three years, and then going back to drinking,
it didn't horrify me at all. My memory loss got so bad that I could <i>never</i>
remember what I did the night before, but I just shrugged my shoulders and said that if the police
weren't banging on the door to arrest me for what I did last night, then it couldn't have been too bad,
so don't worry about it.
<p>
The unthinkable had become thinkable. The horrifying was no longer scary enough.
<p>
The same thing applies to a lot of the other parts of the alcoholic lifestyle, like the progressive
sickness, shame and disgrace, pennilessness, etc...
The unacceptable gradually becomes acceptable.
<p>
I didn't quit the second time until a doctor told me point-blank: &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;

<p>
Now the question is, will Alcoholics Anonymous cause people to relapse, and waste some of that
motivation to quit and stay quit? The evidence says, &quot;Yes&quot;.
<p>
There has not been nearly enough really good testing of Alcoholics Anonymous, but what has been
done shows A.A. to be a real disaster.
When A.A. was put to the test, Alcoholics Anonymous was actually shown to cause:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a much higher rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">a higher rate of re-arrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">higher costs of hospitalization</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">a zero-percent improvement in
the sobriety rate accompanied by a much higher death rate</a>.
</ul>
<p>
All of those facts were revealed by carefully controlled medical tests.<br>
The last test was even done by a leader of Alcoholics Anonymous.
He tried for many years to prove that A.A. works, and he accidentally proved that A.A. does not work; it
just raises the death rate of alcoholics.

<p>
Just the &quot;powerless&quot; doctrine of Alcoholics Anonymous is very
harmful. Teaching alcoholics that they are powerless over alcohol and
cannot quit drinking by using their own will power, intelligence and
determination is crippling. If somebody really believes that, then they
have no reason to try to quit.
<p>
Worse yet, the powerless doctrine provides a perfect &quot;morning-after&quot; excuse:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It isn't my fault. I couldn't help it. I am powerless over alcohol. One of those
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#blank_spot">strange mental blank spots</a> hit and I
was drunk before I knew what was happening. It isn't my fault. I have a disease.&quot;
</font>

</font>
<p>

Why is AA is the most popular and accepted treatment for alcoholics? Just
look at the number of meeting and members they have worldwide &#8212; probably
more than all the rest of the self-help groups put together?

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is a very old and popular and successful cult, even more popular and successful
than Scientology or the Moonies. Those other cults also have lots of meetings in cities
all over the world, but they don't cure people's mental problems or get people into Heaven, either.
None of them deliver on the promises that they make. But they still manage to attract and
keep members whose job is to then go recruiting and get some more members.
</font>
<p>

What about the claim that AA will work only after all treatment attempts
by other programs have been unsuccessful? I.E. Try other programs and only
after you have found them to fail then come to AA?

<p>
<font color="blue">
They want to get people who are in their most vulnerable state, who have
little resistance or self-confidence left. People who are really sick,
confused, and broken-down are easier to manipulate and brain-wash.
<p>
To put it in more technical terms:<br>
Back in 1960, the famous doctor and psychiatrist
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Edgar_Schein">Dr. Edgar H. Schein</a> saw
that Alcoholics Anonymous was a mind-control
or thought-reform program. Schein described brain-washing in terms of
&quot;<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">unfreeze-change-refreeze</a>&quot; the victim's
personality.  Some kind of abuse is usually necessary to shatter an adult's solid personality,
and make them fluid and changeable. Both torture and alcohol poisoning will do the job:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Certain organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) do not
deliberately unfreeze an individual but refuse to take anyone under
their care who is not already unfrozen. Thus a person does not
become eligible for care by AA unless he has really become
desperate, is dissatisfied with himself, and is prepared to turn
his fate over to some greater power.<br>

Prisoners by the Chinese Communists</i>,

</blockquote>

</font>
<p>

(my personal worries)<br>
As I am considered a &quot;dry drunk&quot; and most probably anti-AA will my
girlfriend not be encouraged to disassociate  herself from me?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Probably.
</font>
<p>

What statistics are available for relationships or marriage break-ups of
couples where one person, with a drinking problem, has joined AA, whilst
the other partner &#8212; whether drinking or not &#8212; has remained out of AA or
any other 12-step program?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alas, I don't know of any statistics. I have anecdotal evidence that the breakup and divorce rate
is high, but I don't have any hard numbers. Many of the letters that I get from people
describe marriages that went on the rocks because of Alcoholics Anonymous.
I've also talked to such people personally. Even the A.A. propaganda
movie <i>&quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;</i> showed the guy
abandoning his wife to an alcoholic death for the sake of his own sobriety.
</font>
<p>

(a moderate view)<br>
What about this article;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731142807/http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/12steps/a/aa030438a.htm">
http://alcoholism.about.com/cs/12steps/a/aa030438a.htm</a><br>
Its title is &#8212; AA Works Best, study says Experts unsure why AA is more
effective.<br>
I am no expert but it does seem that any group support will help the
alcoholic? Because AA is so widespread and well known it is only natural
that alcoholics find there way to these support groups first &#8212; before they
have really research or evaluated exactly what AA really is or looked at
any alternatives. In any case can you really expect someone with a severe
drinking problem to really be able to make an informed decision?

<p>
<font color="blue">
What you are seeing is some more A.A. propaganda. They have a whole lot of &quot;experts&quot; who
crank out phony &quot;studies&quot; that show that A.A. works great. It is all a fraud.
A.A. does not work best.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">A.A. does not work at all</a>.
<p>
Studies like that assume a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists, and they even reverse a
cause-and-effect relationship. It's like this:
<ol>
<li> People get really sick from alcoholism, so they go to a detox center to quit.
<li> The Steppers who work at the detox center force all of the patients into A.A. meetings, and
tell them that they must go to A.A. meetings forever, or else they will relapse.
<li> Months later, the people who decide that they would rather drink do so. They also stop going
to A.A. meetings. They go to the meetings at the bars and pubs instead.
<li> The people who want to stay sober do so. And those sober people who
have been fooled into believing that A.A. is necessary for sobriety
continue to go to A.A. meetings.
<li> After a while, some A.A. promoter and talking head notices that
the people at the A.A. meeting are drinking less than the people at the
local bar. He wrongly concludes that A.A. keeps people from drinking.
<li> The A.A. promoter writes a paper that says, &quot;A.A. Works Best&quot;.
</ol>
<a name="faked_studies"> </a>
<p>
See these examples for more garbage from the A.A. propaganda mill:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="newwin00">A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>Spirituality: The key to recovery from alcoholism</i></a><br>
<li> <a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="newwin01">More A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-Galanter.html" target="newwin02">More A.A.-Booster Propaganda: the book <i>Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion</i>, by Marc Galanter</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="newwin03">so-called studies by Rudolf H. Moos</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="newwin04">so-called studies by Keith Humphreys</a>

<li> <a href="orange-Vaillant02.html" target="newwin06">Answer to a George Vaillant Speech</a>
</ol>
And that is only the tip of the iceberg. A.A. has a <i>huge</i> propaganda mill that is constantly
publicizing A.A. and trying to convince everybody that A.A. works great and is the best thing.

From:  	&quot;David A.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Please advise<br>

<p>

I've read your website with great interest.  I am a member of an AA group,
and certainly identify with all the objections that you raise &#8212; although my
problem with my home group has more to do with the person-to-person
cult-like dynamics than with the religious aspects of the group.  But no
matter.

<p>

What my question is, is what are the viable alternatives.  It seems that the
two choices I have are stick with the people I know in AA (who only hang out
with each other, all the time &#8212; and in order to be fully accepted by that
peer group, one must do the same) or to be around my old friends, who are
all still drinking.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello David,
<p>
Obviously those are not the only two choices that you have for a social circle. Make some new friends who
are both sober and sane. Develop friendships that are based on shared positive values, rather
than on shared illnesses.

<p>
As far as &quot;alternatives&quot; go, you seem to be speaking about a
social circle rather than a treatment program for alcoholism.
<p>
We have been talking about the new circle of friends a lot lately.
Check these links:
<a href="orange-letters15.html#social_circle">here</a>

and
<a href="orange-letters48.html#social_circle">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters56.html#social_circle">here</a>.

</font>
<p>

As you mentioned at one point, I believe, the ideal for me would be to have
lots of friends who did not drink, but otherwise lived normal lives and were
not controlled by an AA heirarchy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Correct. Exactly correct. Think of all of the healthy and positive things that you
like to do, and then go find some more people who also like those things.
<p>
Have a good day.

Date:  	Mon, October 16, 2006 5:17 pm<br>
From:  	Dave<br>
Subject: Thoughts from a psychologist<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I have begun to read your gathered materials with considerable interest. So
far, I am impressed that you have done your homework. Interesting facts are
emerging about Bill Wilson that certainly make sense to me. Sorry to hear that
he was such an unfaithful guy. That is an important point for me.

<p>
I too have insisted that many of my clients go to AA, as part of court
mandated treatment.
<p>
I don't do that type of work any more. Very few stayed with it after they
didn't have to. I guess I think of treatment of any sort as slow, limited and
temporary. Sad but true.

<p>
I really doubt that alcoholism has a 50% spontaneous remission rate. Can't
support it with numbers, just doesn't seem to fit with my clinical experience.
Further, if AA has such a dismal success rate, how is that consistent with a
50%  rate of spontaneous remission?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Dave,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I think that the confusion is in the time scale.
The rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics is only about 5% per year.
If you observe a population of alcoholics for only a year or two,
you will only see a 5 or 10% remission rate. But if you
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#exponential">watch them for 13 or more years</a>,
you will see the remission rate creeping upwards towards 50%.
<p>
A.A. is a different thing, however. It has a steady attrition rate. Apparently, many alcoholics
drop out of A.A. and then go on to later quit drinking by themselves, alone, their own way.
</font>
<p>

I think this may be a diagnostic problem. I drank in an abusive way in my
20s. Drunk a couple of times a week routinely. Drank and drove all the time.
Curtailed this dramatically when I went to graduate school at 30 and  haven't
had a drink in 12 years.(55)  I don't think I have had a  spontaneous remission.
AA didn't save me because I never went. I made a decision  to stop by myself.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is precisely what a spontaneous remission is. If you get &quot;treatment&quot; or A.A.,
then it isn't spontaneous remission. Spontaneous remission is what happens with the people
who go it alone and quit on their own, without any &quot;help&quot;.
</font>
<p>

Nobody in my immediate family used drugs other than in the  strictest
definition of social drinking and never to intoxication. I just don't think I am
alcoholic, according to the conventional definition.  Probably denial, eh?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hard to say. Really hard to say when we haven't clearly defined just
what the word &quot;alcoholic&quot; is supposed to mean.
<a href="orange-letters25.html#alcoholic_def">Check out these definitions</a>.
</font>
<p>

I am in Al-Anon, basically an atheist and a skeptic about  everything, but I
like the changes that I have made in my life after joining and  have found a
supportive community.

<p>
I will keep you posted on my impressions as I go. Perhaps you will  enter
into a collaborative discussion with me as I learn from you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, sounds good.
</font>
<p>


Is there data
supporting the efficacy of SMART recovery? I attended one meeting of Rational
Recovery in my area and found it to be too social and disorganized. I am curious
about how your information will change the work I do with my clients. Now
where  is that picture of me standing in front of the Wilson House......

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't have any really good data on the SMART recovery rate. The closest thing that I have is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">the three-way test that Dr. Brandsma did</a>:
testing A.A., Rational Behavioral Therapy, and a control group.
(SMART uses a variant called Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy.)
A.A. did the worst, RBT the best.
<p>
Rational Recovery is now history. Jack Trimpey disbanded the organization.
Try some SMART meetings, and see if you like them. Also note that there is a lot of
variation between groups there too, so try at least 3 different groups before you form
a set opinion.

Hello Orange,

<p>

Thanks for the reply. I am going to think about this some more. Now that I
have a cartridge for my printer, I am going to print out your 'voices' that
lead  to relapse to discuss with clients. I think of this as relapse prevention.

<p>

Just one more thought about spontaneous remission...<br>
There are some fairly consistent definitions of alcoholism that  include:
<ul>
<li>
Loss of predictability.  If someone's intention is to  drink moderately on an
occasion and then drinks to excess, particularly if there  are consequences
that one could reasonable expect, I think this is diagnostic of  what is called
Loss of Control (predictability). Non alcoholics don't typically  experience
this sx.
<li>
Tolerance: If you can drink everyone under the table,  after a long career of
drinking, this is tolerance. Social drinkers rarely  experience this.
<li>
Third, is amnestic periods or blackouts. Loss of recall  for events during a
drinking period. Social drinkers never experience  this.
</ul>
<p>
I believe too that there are Abusive drinkers, who are not alcoholic
necessarily.
<p>
I am sure that I fit into that category in my 20s. In that respect, I  did
not have a spontaneous remission, despite not having  treatment. I was never
alcoholic.

I watch too many people struggle to get a year clean, despite desperate
efforts, to believe that I put 12 years together without a whimper and was still
an alcoholic. I would be more than happy to be alcoholic. Good for  business.
Just never fit the criteria, despite years of abusive drinking. Never  had
tolerance, never had loss of control, and never had a blackout and don't  have
any first order relatives who are drinkers. No success story here.  Just got
older and had a reason to curtail my old habits. I am compulsive about  cookies
and pistachios, but a 6 pack, or a bag of weed, or an ounce of coke  would sit
on my coffee table for a year and still be there.
The cookies would be gone in an hour!

I wonder if the dropout rate in AA is fundamentally different from the
dropout rate for Bally's or Powerhouse?  I will bet 90% of those who get  religion
in January aren't going to the gym in March. Flaw in the gym? Having a
trainer and accountability improved my odds, much like a sponsor would improve  the
odds of success in AA.

I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this. I will learn from you
regardless if you agree with me or not. Trying to clarify my thinking, not
convince you.

Hi Dave,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.

<p>
Well, I had all three of those signs of alcoholism, to the max.
The memory loss got so bad that I could <i>never</i> remember what I did the night before.
I just got used to it, and stopped being frightened by black-outs.
Blacking out each night was normal.
And then it got to the point that, even while totally sober,
 sometimes I couldn't even remember what I had done earlier in the day.
Big chunks of days were disappearing. I was flirting with <i>Wernicke-Korsakoff</i> syndrome.

<p>
Your point about the dropout rate at Bally's is a good one. I suspect that you will also see the
same dropout rate at Weight-Watchers and all kinds of self-improvement programs.
I think that is just human nature. People are unclear on their motives.
They think they want something, but then it turns out that they don't. Or they don't want it enough
to really work and sacrifice for it.

<p>
Alas, that doesn't let A.A. off of the hook. What that really means is that A.A. is ineffective and
just claims the credit for the few people who are determined to succeed, and who will do whatever it takes.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship">The one study that I know of</a>
 that asked whether sponsors (in Narcotics Anonymous)
 helped drug addicts to quit their addictions found that the answer was, &quot;No.&quot;
The sponsors didn't improve the situation at all.
Addicts who got sponsors did no better than ones who didn't. (But the sponsors did better.
Apparently volunteering to be a sponsor helps someone to stay clean and sober.)
<p>
About your question about whether you personally are or were &quot;an alcoholic&quot;,
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1">the Rand Corporation study</a>
that found that half of the alcoholics who successfully stopped self-destructive drinking
did it by
total abstinence, and half by tapering off into moderate controlled drinking.
The point there is just &quot;Different Strokes for Different Folks&quot;.
Alcoholics are not all alike.
<p>
Now I am one of the people who has to totally abstain from drinking alcohol.
 I know that from many years of experimentation and bitter experience.
And yet, staying totally sober is almost easy for me.
That may seem to be counter-intuitive, but that's how it is.
<p>

At the same time, I am acutely aware of how few others around me have succeeded.
In fact, I hear that I am the sole survivor out of my class at the &quot;treatment center&quot;.
That's sad. Some of those people were my friends, and I was rooting for them.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.
