So how does A.A. score as a cult? On a scale of zero to ten,
where zero means that it isn't like
a cult at all, and ten means that A.A. is really like a cult, I
score A.A. like this: (Feel free to grab a

One just <i><b>does not</b></i> criticize the
Founders, Bill Wilson and Doctor
Bob, or their wonderful program.

Bill Wilson's &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot; &#8212; really titled
&quot;<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>&quot; &#8212;
is cited as the ultimate answer for everything,
a new Bible for contemporary alcoholics. If Bill said something,
then it is automatically true. In the eyes of the A.A. faithful,
Bill Wilson never made a mistake after he started A.A.,
and never gave bad advice to any A.A. member.
Bill Wilson was a paragon of sanity, clarity, wisdom, and honesty.
<p>
<a name="God_given"> </a>
Many of the true believers in Alcoholics Anonymous actually believe that
Bill Wilson's writings were inspired by God, just like the Bible.
They say that Wilson wrote the Twelve Steps while
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#Bill_guided"><i>receiving guidance</i></a>
from God.
The faithful reverently pore over books like The <i>Big Book</i>,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, and <i>As Bill Sees It</i>
as if they were holy scriptures, rather than
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">the ravings of a lunatic</a>.
Bill's writings in the <i>Big Book</i>
&#8212; &quot;the first 164 pages&quot; &#8212; are considered to be so sacred
that they cannot ever be updated, fixed, or changed.
The 4th edition of the <i>Big Book</i> was just released, and the first
164 pages are still unchanged. Not a single lie or error was corrected.

<p>
<a name="Bill_imperfect"> </a>
The faithful stubbornly ignore the fact that the <i>Big Book</i> and
Bill Wilson's other writings demonstrate all too clearly that he was
suffering from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">Delusions of Grandeur</a>,
specifically <i>&quot;Delusional (Paranoid) Disorder, Grandiose Type,
mental disorder number 297.10&quot;</i> as described in the <i>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> of the American Psychiatric
Association, on pages 200 to 203 in the third edition
(<a href="orange-bibliography.html#dsm3">DSM-III-R</a>),
and on pages 297 to 301 in the fourth edition
(<a href="orange-bibliography.html#dsm4">DSM-IV</a>).
<p>
Bill Wilson was also a textbook case of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic"><i>&quot;Narcissistic
Personality Disorder, mental disorder number 301.81&quot;</i></a>
&#8212; again, as described in the DSM-IV, on pages 658-661.
<p>
The faithful also pointedly ignore the overwhelming evidence that Bill Wilson was
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#manipulative">selfish, manipulative</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">superstitious</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#arrogant">egotistical, arrogant</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik">vicious</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-aacoa.html">financially dishonest</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-otherwomen.html">a philandering sexual predator</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Nantucket">a liar</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-bigbook.html">a con artist</a>,
and
<li> <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">insane</a>.
</ul>

The faithful even ignore the fact that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#screw_patients">Bill Wilson took sexual
advantage of sick women</a>
who came to A.A. seeking help to avoid death from alcohol.
While women were still shaky, cloudy-headed, and confused from alcohol poisoning
and alcohol withdrawal, Bill Wilson was scheming to get into their pants.
That is an especially heartless kind of exploitation of vulnerable people.

Likewise, the true believers ignore the evidence that Dr.
Robert Smith, the other co-founder of A.A., had serious mental problems
of his own. The faithful proclaim was Dr. Bob was a wise saint, in spite
of the facts that:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Doctor Bob seems to have been a power-tripping neurotic dogmatic
religious fanatic who got his kicks by having people
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender
to God on their knees before him</a>. He was so narrow-minded that he
wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that he feels sorry for you if you won't
accept the religious proclamations of the Bill and Bob team:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you think you are an atheist, an agnostic, a skeptic, or have
any other form of intellectual pride which keeps you from accepting
what is in this book, I feel sorry for you.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith,
<i>Doctor Bob's Story</i>, Page 181.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
<li>
Doctor Bob was such an insane autocratic tyrant
that he forced a 31-year-old alcoholic womanizer on his 17-year-old
step-daughter Sue Smith in order to break up her high-school romance with
her teenage boyfriend Ray Windows, whom Doctor Bob didn't like. The older alcoholic was
&quot;<b>A.A. Number Four</b>&quot; &#8212; the constantly-relapsing, philandering,
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Galbraith">Ernie Galbraith</a> &#8212;
the author of the <i>Big Book</i> first edition story
<i>&quot;The Seven-Month Slip&quot;</i>.
The 'seven-month slip' was not a small slip after seven months of sobriety; it was a
full-blown seven-month-long hard-drinking relapse after a year of sobriety.
<p>
You would think that Doctor Bob should have learned something about Ernie from reading
his autobiographical story in the <i>Big Book</i>, but no, Doctor Bob didn't learn anything.
Then, after Ernie took Susan for himself,
Doctor Bob complained bitterly that Ernie Galbraith had &quot;double-crossed him&quot;
by seducing Sue Smith.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>

<li>
Dr. Bob was so damaged by alcohol that he was apparently incapable
of supporting himself and his family while ostensibly still practicing
medicine. Dr. Bob had to be supported by an A.A. handout for the rest
of his life.<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>What kind of a doctor is so incapable of earning his own keep that he
has to be supported by charity?</i>

</ul>

<p>
According to Bill Wilson and A.A., you are just a brain-damaged alcoholic,
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, your thinking is &quot;alcoholic&quot;,
and you aren't qualified to judge A.A. or the teachings of Bill Wilson.
If you disagree with any of the
insanity of A.A., it just proves that you are <i>diseased</i> and <i>in denial</i>.

<li>
They will be told that
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind">their mind is useless</a>,
damaged by alcohol, and is a great liability. They will be told that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#cunning"><i>alcohol is cunning,
baffling, and powerful</i></a>,
and that their minds are being controlled by their
addiction to alcohol, and that their addiction wants to kill them.
<li>
They will be told that their old bad habits don't want to let go
of them, so any deviation from the program is proof that they are
diseased.
<li>
Any disagreement with the standard dogma, or any attempt
to think and act independently, is interpreted as alcoholism dominating
the member's mind, and defeating his attempts at sobriety.
</ul>
<p>
On top of all of that, Bill Wilson had a vicious hatred of alcoholics.
That may seem unlikely, since he supposedly
dedicated his life to unselfishly helping alcoholics and saving their lives, but it is true.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">Bill Wilson actually denigrated alcoholics and put
them down at every opportunity.</a>
Bill dedicated the second half of his life to being a cult leader and making
alcoholics into his slaves who supported him in comfort for the rest of his life,
so that he never had to work again.
Bill Wilson actually hated himself, and had a vicious contempt for
his own faults and character flaws, so he projected his own failings
onto everyone around him.
He created a very negative stereotype of <i>&quot;The Alcoholic&quot;</i>,
and projected all of his faults onto that mythical character, and then he
said, &quot;Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;
<p>
Bill Wilson declared that:
<ul>
<li> Alcoholics' personalities are dominated by
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrecov.html#stereotype1">character defects</a>&quot; (meaning: sins),
particularly the
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness">Seven Deadly Sins</a> of
Pride, Greed, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust, Anger, and Envy.
<li> Alcoholics are very dishonest, and will
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#wiggle">&quot;wiggle
out of&quot;</a> the terms of a contract, if they can do it.
<li> Alcoholics are <a href="orange-heresy.html#mundane">very selfish</a>.
<li> Alcoholics are
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease">full of resentments</a>.
<li> Alcoholics are
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#alcoholic_defects">an
argumentative lot</a>.
<li> Alcoholics are all <a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">stupid,
superstitious, and cowardly</a>.
<li> Alcoholics are
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#manipulative">manipulative</a>,
and will always try to get their own way in some underhanded fashion.
<li> Alcoholics are completely selfish and inconsiderate.
For some of them, recruiting another member for A.A. was
<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html#first_unselfish">the first
time in their lives</a> that they had ever committed an unselfish act.
<li> Alcoholics are all alike, and all alcoholics have immensely
inflated egos, and they are all
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#stereotype">pompous, self-important,
strutting-peacock fools</a>. They think they are &quot;the center of the
Universe&quot;, and too big and
&quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good">too good to
need God</a>.&quot;
<li> Alcoholics even imagine that <i>they are God</i> (which is why Ernest Kurtz
wrote a very pro-AA book named
&quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Kurtz">Not God</a>&quot;).

<li> Alcoholics
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#lash_of_alcoholism">don't
want to be moral</a>.
<ul>
<li> They don't want to be good.
<li> They don't want to do the right thing.
<li> They don't want to do what will help them to recover.
<li> They won't work the Twelve Steps until they &quot;bottom out&quot;
and &quot;the lash of alcoholism&quot; beats them into submission.
</ul>
<li> The alcoholic doesn't like to live
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#live_past">any place but in
the past</a>.
<li> See the file
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html"><i>The 'Us Stupid Drunks' Conspiracy</i></a>
for much, much more of Bill's ravings about how bad alcoholics are.
</ul>
<p>
All of which leaves us with one big question, &quot;If alcoholics
are all so bad, how could the leading alcoholic, Bill Wilson, be so
'spiritual'?&quot;

A.A. scores a 10 again.<br>
<p>

They say, &quot;You can't leave, because if you do, you
will relapse and die drunk.&quot; They say that the world is a dangerous
place and you can't make it on your own.
 Then they recite a list of
friends who didn't do the Twelve Steps, and
who went out and died. A.A. also tells people that they will turn
into bitterly unhappy &quot;dry drunks&quot;
if they leave A.A. and manage to stay abstinent.
<p>
The slogan is, &quot;Don't leave five minutes before the miracle.&quot;
<br>
And, &quot;A.A. is like the Mafia: If you leave it, you die.&quot;

<p>
A.A. also guilt-trips people into not leaving A.A. by declaring that &quot;Now you must
<i>keep coming back</i> and teach the newcomers, and <i>freely give what was freely given to you</i>.
It would be selfish for you to leave and not give back to others.&quot;

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> says, referring to this &quot;spiritual
quit-drinking program&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have indulged in spiritual intoxication.
Like a gaunt prospector, belt drawn in over the last ounce of food,
our pick has struck gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of
frustration knew no bounds. Father feels he has struck something
better than gold. For a time he may try to hug the new treasure
to himself. He may not see at once that he has barely scratched a
limitless lode which will pay dividends only if he mines it for
the rest of his life and insists on giving away the entire product.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, Chapter 9,
<i>The Family Afterward</i>, pages 128-129.</font>
<p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Giving away the entire product&quot; is a euphemism for
recruiting and training new members for A.A.,
<i>&quot;freely giving that which was freely given to us&quot;</i>.
So that paragraph really means that you can't ever
leave the group, and must spend the rest of your life <i>&quot;working a strong
program&quot;</i> and recruiting new members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
(And the line about, <i>&quot;For a time he may try
to hug the new treasure to himself&quot;</i> is ridiculous.
Bill Wilson did not have that problem at all. He became a
raving proselytizing missionary immediately after
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher">his own religious conversion</a>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#arrogant">starting home churches</a>
within days of his belladonna-induced &quot;vision of God&quot;,
and driving the other alcoholics nuts and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#Silkworth_fear_induction">scaring them and
driving them away</a> with all of his preaching
and trying to convert everybody else to his newfound religious beliefs.
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;He may try to hug the new treasure to himself.&quot;</i>
</font>
No, that was not Bill's problem.)<br>
</font>

<p>
The Northern Illinois Area A.A. Intergroup actually feels entitled to
tell recovering alcoholics
<a href="orange-not_good.html#no_college">not to go back to college and
finish their degrees</a> &#8212; to just stay with the A.A. group,
and stay ignorant and unemployable, and to spend their spare time recruiting for A.A.
at the local jail. No exit. You shouldn't ever leave A.A., not even to go to college.

<p>
<a name="dependent"> </a>
Lastly, note that A.A. &quot;treatment&quot; of the so-called
&quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism is the antithesis of good medical
treatment. No attempt is made to actually cure the patient of the disease.
Rather than healing people and returning them to normal life in the mainstream of
society, like real doctors do, A.A. has the goal of keeping people coming back to A.A. meetings
for the rest of their lives. You never recover, so you have to <i>Keep Coming Back</i>
to more A.A. meetings.
The goal of 12-Step-based &quot;treatment&quot; is not to heal people
and end the treatment; it is
<a href="orange-not_good.html#dependency">to addict the patient to the treatment</a>,
to make him
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_dependent">psychologically dependent upon A.A.</a>,
so that he will spend the rest of his life in a 12-Step group like
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.

The literature of Al-Anon reinforces this &quot;no graduates&quot;
teaching:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another friend had attended Al-Anon a couple of years, and ended up
chairman of the group for six months.
As she went home the night new officers were chosen, she thought to
herself,
&quot;I've attended Al-Anon for three years. I've learned all it
teaches and I think I've graduated. I'll go next week to turn over
the chairmanship and then I'll be free Wednesday nights.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But something happened that next Wednesday at her job and her
first thought was, &quot;This is where Al-Anon can keep me straight
&#8212; I need it more than ever.&quot; That was a dozen years ago and
she is still attending an Al-Anon group!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Al-Anon's favorite forum editorials</i>, page 141.</font>

<p>
We are never told what crisis on the job prompted the woman not to
leave Al-Anon; it was just some vague &quot;something happened.&quot;
Note the attitude of
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are mentally incompetent.
You can't handle the stresses and pressures of real life by yourself,
but your 'support group' &#8212; a group of similarly-crippled mental
incompetents who aren't capable of running their own lives either
&#8212; will somehow 'keep you straight'.&quot;</font>
<p>
Hence, you will never graduate, because &quot;something&quot;
will always happen,
so you will end up giving the group every Wednesday evening for the
rest of your life.
<p>
No graduates. You can't ever leave the cult.

<p>
A.A. has plenty of cultish terminology, lots of

and bombastically redefined words, and a whole bunch of
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_thought_stop">mind-bending slogans
and thought-stopping clich&eacute;s</a>.

<p>
In his writings, William Wilson displayed a really bad case of the
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#alice"><i>Alice in Wonderland</i></a>
<b><i>&quot;Words mean whatever I want them to mean&quot;</i></b> syndrome:
<p>
<ul>
<a name="sobriety"> </a>
<li> This is a good redefinition: in Alcoholics Anonymous
terminology, the word &quot;sobriety&quot; doesn't
mean &quot;no alcohol&quot; or &quot;not drinking&quot; or &quot;an unintoxicated
state&quot;; it has this bombastic redefinition:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A special state of Grace gained by working the Steps and
maintaining absolute abstinence. It is characterized by
feelings of Serenity and Gratitude. It is a state of living
according to God's will, not one's own. It is sanity.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="blue">
(Even the word
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane">sanity</a>&quot;
here is redefined; it is
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman's</a>
&quot;surrendered-to-God-control&quot;, or surrendered-to-Frank-control, state of living.)<br>
</font>
Then A.A. members speak about &quot;the quality of someone's sobriety&quot;
as if evaluating levels or degrees of spirituality.

<p>
<a name="recovery"> </a>
<li>
Another redefinition: &quot;recovery&quot; does not mean rebuilding
your health, mind, body, and life while not drinking; it means going to
A.A. meetings, doing The Twelve Steps, and
abstaining from alcohol. According to A.A. dogma, someone can't be
recovering from alcoholism if he isn't going
to A.A. meetings and doing The Twelve Steps;
he's &quot;only abstaining&quot;, or
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#not_dry">only dry</a>&quot;,
or &quot;only a
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html"><i>dry drunk</i></a>&quot;.

<p>
(And, strangely enough, someone,
like William G. Wilson, could be
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">actively killing himself
with tobacco, and dying of emphysema</a>, and still somehow be
&quot;in recovery&quot; and living a spiritual life in
compliance with God's will. I guess God really wanted Bill to die of
lung problems early, and not be of service for any more years.)

<center>
<table width="90%" border="4" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font face="Helvetica,Swiss,Arial">
Note that those two redefinitions &#8212; sobriety and recovery &#8212;
allow A.A.-dominated drug and alcohol treatment
facilities, which are financed with public tax dollars, to
advertise jobs as being reserved for people
who are &quot;in recovery, with at least 6 months of
sobriety&quot;, and then only hire other members of the
Twelve-Step religion. It sounds like a nice hire-the-handicapped
policy, but it is really religious discrimination, which violates
many different laws, but they seem to be getting away with it anyway.
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p><li>
A &quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunk</a>&quot; is
someone who has quit drinking alcohol, but who won't do
Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps. Such an unfortunate fellow will supposedly
display all of the objectionable characteristics and behavior of an
obnoxious drunkard, even though he hasn't drunk any alcohol.
In addition, <i>dry drunks</i> are supposed to be angry and
resentful and bitterly unhappy,
because they aren't getting big doses of <i>&quot;Serenity and
Gratitude&quot;</i> from doing the Twelve Steps.

<p><li>
&quot;Going out&quot; means leaving Alcoholics Anonymous and resuming drinking.
(Those two actions are considered synonyms: They say that if you quit A.A.,
 you will of course resume drinking
and almost certainly die drunk in a gutter.)

<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<a name="humility_def"> </a>
<p><li>
Another redefinition: Bill Wilson wrote that
an attitude of proper humility must include
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;a desire to seek and do God's
will.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
So all of the innocent-sounding appeals for &quot;humility&quot; are not
requests for people to avoid egotism &#8212; they are really
veiled demands for people to practice Step Eleven
and spend every day of the rest of their lives
&quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot;
(as &quot;God's will&quot; is
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#receive_guidance">
defined by their sponsors</a> and the group's other elders, of course).

<p><li> &quot;Sanity is living according to God's Will, rather
than one's own.&quot;<br>

Notice what that does to Step Two:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>Came to believe that a Power
greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</i></b><br>
</font>
It becomes:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;We came to believe that God could make us obey God's wishes.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
That is an example of the &quot;<i>constant redefinition</i> game&quot;,
where words have one definition for the newcomers, and a very different
definition for the old-timers who are &quot;in the know</a>.&quot;
(There are
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_levels_of_truth">different levels
of truth</a>.)

<ul>
<li> To a beginner, the &quot;insanity&quot; term in Step Two means that
someone was insanely drinking far too much alcohol, and killing himself.<br>

<li> To the old-timer, the &quot;insanity&quot; was living a life <b>not
spent</b> &quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God.&quot;<br>

<li> Likewise, even the &quot;Power greater than ourselves&quot;
and &quot;God as we understood Him&quot; will get
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater">redefined to &quot;The
God of Bill Wilson's understanding.&quot;</a>
</ul>
<p>
So, finally, Step Two will also come to mean that we should
practice Step Eleven and spend our time &quot;Seeking and Doing the Will
of God&quot;
(<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#receive_guidance">as defined by our sponsors, of course</a>).

<p><li>
Then Bill redefined the word &quot;ambition&quot;:

Well, if you really want to see hairsplitting and scholastic tortuousness,
start up a debate with A.A. members about the difference between the words

&quot;Spiritual&quot; seems to mean different things at different times:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Sometimes it means doing the Twelve Steps.
<p>
<li> Sometimes it means going to A.A. meetings.
<p>
<li> Sometimes it means believing in God, as <b><i>&quot;we&quot;</i></b>
understand Him, or
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#deity3">as
A.A. understands Him</a>.
<p>
<li> Sometimes it means recruiting new members for A.A..
<p>
<li> Sometimes, it is some kind of technology, or magic:

<i>&quot;Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles

</font>
<p>
<li> Sometimes, it is just part of a smug game of one-upmanship:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Religion is for people who are afraid of going to Hell;
Spirituality is for people who have been there.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
&#8212;Which implies
that A.A. people are superior to ordinary religious believers,
because A.A. members are more experienced, and they aren't afraid
of going to Hell any more.
</font>

<p>
<li> &quot;Spiritual development&quot; means going to A.A. meetings,
doing the Twelve Steps, and recruiting for Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<li> Turning control of your life and your will over to <i>Something Else</i> or
<i>Somebody Else</i>, like A.A., is also called &quot;spiritual development&quot;.
<font size="-1">(<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 36.)</font>

<p>
<li> And sometimes &quot;spiritual growth&quot; or &quot;spiritual development&quot; means
becoming a religious maniac and obsessively devoting your whole life to A.A., while
neglecting your family and career:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Assume on the other hand that father has, at the outset,
<font color="#9F0000">

He is unable to focus on anything else.
As soon as his sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course,

it is well to let him go as far as he likes

&nbsp; ... &nbsp;

<a href="orange-spirrel.html#interchangeable">interchangeably</a>.
So much for the slogan,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html">It's spiritual, not religious</a>.&quot;</font>

<p>
<li> And much of the A.A.-booster literature is even worse when it comes
to defining &quot;spirituality&quot;. See the article
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html"><i>Spirituality: The key to recovery
from alcoholism</i></a> for an entertaining example of someone constantly
flip-flopping around like a fish out of water, trying to figure out what it is.
</ul>

<a name="vital_step"> </a>
<p>
<li> The word &quot;suggested&quot; has been tortured as well.
The <i>Big Book</i> says, in Chapter Five, that the Twelve Steps are &quot;suggested&quot;
as a program of recovery. (Page 59.)
Bill Wilson wanted the 12 steps to be a requirement, but the other early
A.A. members wouldn't buy it.
They objected strongly when Bill showed them his first draft of Chapter Five.
They knew that Bill's dogmatic religiosity would drive away many
of the very alcoholics whom the program was supposed to help.
In a loud and long screaming contest, they demanded that Bill label
the Twelve Steps as just &quot;a suggested program&quot;.
But Bill got his revenge later  &#8212;  <i>Really Soon</i> &quot;later&quot;  &#8212; 
 like
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#vital" target="_blank">on the very first page of the next chapter that he wrote</a>

<p>
That is quite a strong &quot;suggestion&quot;.
<p>
Likewise, the relevant A.A. slogan is:

A.A. gets a 10.<br>

has standard answers for everything, and discourages independent thought
or criticism of the program.
<font color="#4f007f">

&quot; READ THE BOOK, get a SPONSOR, develop a HIGHER POWER UNDERSTANDING,
don't DRINK, go to MEETINGS, and call other ALCOHOLICS.&quot;

<p>
The true believers say that everything you need to know

In addition, William

with the answers to all questions;
if they said something, then it is automatically unquestionably true.
<p>
The web site

</font>
And it shows a graphic that says
<font color="#4f007f">

</font>
A.A. claims that groups are autonomous and free to formulate their own styles and
content, but that isn't true at all. Groups that do not parrot the <i>Big Book</i> dogma
with the correct degree of conformity get criticized with cries of
<font color="#4f007f">

The Twelve Steps are actually a procedure for undermining your independence, not
for encouraging freedom:
<ul>
<li>
The first of the Twelve Steps starts the process of destroying one's
independent mind: you must admit that you
are powerless over alcohol, and that your life is unmanageable.
Meaning: <i>YOU cannot manage your own life.</i>
<p>
<li>
In Step Two you <b><i>come to believe</i></b> that you are insane,
and that only some undefined &quot;Power greater than yourself&quot; can fix you
&#8212; &quot;restore you to sanity.&quot;
<p>
<li>
Then, in Step Three, you must surrender your will and
your life to &quot;God&quot; or a &quot;Higher Power&quot; (or the group
or your sponsor), and let that &quot;Somebody Else&quot; control your life and
tell you what to do, and even
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#freedom2think">what to think</a>.
<p>
<li>
Then, Steps Four through Ten induce guilt by dwelling on your past
sins, moral shortcomings, defects of character, <i>the exact nature
of your wrongs</i>, and your offenses to others. Such guilt makes it
easier to manipulate your mind.
</ul>
<p>
Remember that <i>guilt induction</i> and <i>confession sessions</i>
were the two essential elements of
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds">the Red Chinese brainwashing
program</a>. And Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer listed
<i>&quot;Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency&quot;</i>
as one of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">the six essential conditions</a>
for effective mind-control or &quot;brain-washing&quot; programs, and that is just what Steps One
through Ten do.


<p>
<a name="uniformTraditions">
Three of
<a href="orange-traditions.html">the Twelve Traditions</a>
reinforce this group-think attitude:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
1) Our common welfare should come first; personal
recovery depends on A.A. unity.<br>

2) For our group purpose there is but one ultimate
authority &#8212; a loving God as He may express
Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted
servants &#8212; they do not govern.<br>
12) Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions,
ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Obviously, if you disagree with the standard party line, and
express contrary ideas and opinions, or act independently,
you are breaking &quot;A.A. unity&quot;, and Tradition One says that no one is
allowed to do that.
<p>
Tradition Two says
that God is the ultimate authority, as He expresses Himself in
the group conscience.
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>But <i>who</i> decides <i>what</i> God is expressing in the group conscience?</b>
</font>
Obviously, it is
the leaders, the old-timers who are
the most-indoctrinated true believers, and who dominate the &quot;sharing&quot;
sessions with their well-practiced raps and their standard sermons.<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Besides which, who says that God is really expressing <i>anything</i>
in the group conscience?
What if God doesn't feel like spending all of His time in
A.A. meetings? Wasn't it rather presumptuous of Bill Wilson to
assume that God does?
Maybe the group conscience is really just
the collective opinion of a bunch of old fools...<br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
I want to see the proxy.
Show me a signed statement from God that says,<br>
<font color="green">
<i>&quot;I hereby authorize this group of old-timers to speak for me.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</font>
<font color="blue">
It is just outrageously arrogant of the old-timers to imagine that when they open
their mouths, God's opinion comes out.
</font>

<p>
Similarly, the demand for &quot;principles before personalities&quot;
in Tradition Twelve just means
that their cult practices take precedence over your personal beliefs,
morals, desires, or even your personal welfare. Again, you must conform to
the group.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Then, over and over again, you will be told to stop thinking,
and just do what everyone else does.  You will be told that your
mind is useless, damaged by alcohol, and is a great liability.
You will be told that
your mind is controlled by your addiction, and that your addiction
wants to kill you.  So just follow the standard program, and do
what your sponsor says, and...<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Quit your stinkin' thinkin'.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't drink, don't think, and go to meetings.<br>
&quot;You have a thinking problem, not a drinking problem.&quot;<br>
&quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;<br>
&quot;The three most dangerous words for an alcoholic &#8212; 'I've been thinking'&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't go into your mind alone; it's not a safe neighborhood.&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't go in your head alone. It's a dangerous neighborhood.&quot;<br>
&quot;Just do things the tried and true way.&quot;<br>
&quot;Look for the similarities, not the differences.&quot;<br>
&quot;People who think they know it all are very irritating to those of us who do.&quot;<br>
&quot;You can act yourself into thinking right easier than you can think yourself into acting right.&quot;<br>
&quot;I know I'm in trouble when I start thinking I can run my own life.&quot;<br>

<p>
Then some oldtimer will pontificate and tell the story of
how he tried to make a chocolate cake by using his aunt's recipe,
but he only used the parts of the recipe that he liked, and
he left out the rest. The result was a terrible cake. So the moral
of the story is that you must follow the 12-Step recipe exactly as it
is given to you.

<p>
People who dare to criticize any of this sacred Group-Think dogma
can be subjected to any of the punishing tactics mentioned in
<a href="#ca_personal_attacks">item 10, <i>Personal attacks on critics.</i></a>

<p>
When it comes to &quot;Group-Feel&quot;, A.A. has a bad case of that, too.
Good members are supposed to just &quot;stuff their feelings&quot;, and maintain
a flat emotional state that features endless &quot;Serenity and Gratitude.&quot;
Other emotions are considered bad, and a sign that someone is failing to &quot;work
a strong program&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And the injunction against &quot;resentments&quot; is extremely strong:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'Resentment is the &quot;number one&quot; offender.
It destroys more alcoholics than anything else.
From it stem <font color="#9F0000">all forms</font> of spiritual disease...'<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The only exception to this rule is anger:
<a href="orange-letters.html#Bernie">the old-timers are permitted to snap
and snarl</a> at newcomers who don't conform to the program,
and put them down with caustic remarks that drip with
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm"> sarcasm and condescension</a>.
And they pass that behavior off as &quot;tough love.&quot;
And of course the oldtimers can attack critics of A.A. with anger, and that does not seem to
violate those principles of &quot;spirituality&quot;.

A.A. gets a 10 on this one (and deserves about a hundred),<br>
for everything from expecting God to micro-manage their lives, and solve
all of their problems, to their claims that God delivers miracles on
demand, to Bill Wilson's demands that we all stop thinking,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason">give up &quot;Reason&quot;</a>
and human intelligence, and just &quot;have faith.&quot;

<p>
Robert Thomsen and Ernest Kurtz described in their books
how Ebby Thacher and his friend Shep Cornell worked to convert Bill
Wilson to Buchmanism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Ebby and Shep C. were now asking him to give up the one attribute
of which he was the most proud, the one quality that set a man above
the animals &#8212; his inquiring, rational mind. And they wanted him to
give this up for an illusion.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... what they were asking him to do represented weakness to him.
How could a man so demean himself as to surrender the one thing
in which he should have faith, his innate, inquiring mind? &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It might be the last arrogant gasp of alcoholic pride but,
miserable and terrified as he was, he would not humble himself
here. On this point he would go out swinging.<br>

<b>Bill W.</b>, Robert Thomsen, pages 213-214.</font>

<p>
Bill vowed to fight to the end, but within two weeks, under the influence
of delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal, and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">hallucinogenic drugs</a>,
Bill Wilson had flipped out and given up his rational mind,
and &quot;surrendered&quot;,
and been &quot;changed&quot; into a true-believer Oxford Group cult member
who then went on to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">exhort all other alcoholics</a>
to also abandon Reason, logic, and human intelligence, and just &quot;have faith.&quot;
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#9F0000">
By the way, Bill Wilson never had a problem with giving up his &quot;his inquiring, rational mind&quot;.
Bill's whole story about being an icy intellectual and an atheist who believed in science and
evolution until he was converted into a believer by a miraculous spiritual experience was an act, a lie.
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education">Bill Wilson was a superstitious flunk-out, not an
intellectual</a>. Bill didn't even get &quot;a gentleman's C's&quot; in school.
He didn't even graduate.
Bill Wilson excelled at baseball in school, not in math, science, philosophy,
or theology.
And then Bill exhorted his followers to give up their intelligence and their
rational, thinking minds, and just believe in what he said.

<p>
Bill Wilson stated over and over again that he wanted people to
abandon logic, scientific thinking, and reason, and use superstition

nothing, meaning nothing, whirling on to a destiny of nothingness?

In the next sentence, Bill Wilson then declared that we have been

That was natural, but let us think a little more closely.
Without knowing it, had we not been brought to where we stood
by a certain kind of faith? For did we not believe in our own
reasoning? Did we not have confidence in our ability to think?
What was that but a sort of faith? Yes, we had been faithful,
abjectly faithful to the God of Reason. So, in one way or another,
we discovered that faith had been involved all the time!<br>

<p>
In his next book, Bill Wilson continued to demand that people stop thinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;... all you really need is a truly open mind.
Just resign from the debating society and quit bothering yourself with
such deep questions as whether it was the hen or the egg that came first.
Again I say, all you need is the open mind.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The sponsor continues, &quot;Take, for example, my own case. I had a scientific schooling.
Naturally I respected, venerated, even worshiped science. As a matter of fact,
I still do &#8212; all except the worship part. Time after time, my instructors held
up to me the basic principle of all scientific progress: search and research, again
and again, always with the open mind. When I first looked at A.A. my reaction
was just like yours. This A.A. business, I thought, is totally unscientific.
This I can't swallow. I simply won't consider such nonsense.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Then I woke up. I had to admit that A.A. showed results, prodigious results. I
saw that my attitude regarding these had been anything but scientific.
It wasn't A.A. that had the closed mind, it was me. The minute I stopped
arguing, I could begin to see and feel. Right there, Step Two gently and
very gradually began to infiltrate my life. I can't say upon what occasion
or upon what day I came to believe in a Power greater than myself, but I certainly
have that belief now. To acquire it, I had only to stop fighting
and practice the rest of A.A.'s program as enthusiastically as I could.&quot;<br>

That story obviously reeks of
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">mental surrender to the cult</a>.
Just stop thinking, just stop questioning, and wonderful things will happen, Bill says.
<p>
And the &quot;sponsor&quot; supposedly didn't find happiness until he
underwent a religious conversion and &quot;came to believe&quot; in
the Alcoholics Anonymous deity.
So much for the often-repeated A.A. statements that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything">you don't have to believe
anything</a>.
<p>
And Bill's whole story about being educated in the sciences was a fraud.
Bill was never educated in the sciences; he flunked out of school. Bill Wilson just

The anti-intellectual bias in Alcoholics Anonymous is so strong that an
article published in <i>American Medical News</i> magazine by an A.A. booster
declared that the Twelve Steps would be wonderful for <i>all</i> doctors,
if <i>only they would quit thinking and stop trying to be logical and scientific</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To get the full benefit of AA, Dr. Ken notes, he had to stop analyzing
his experiences, as he had been trained to do in medical school:
&quot;Once I stopped thinking and got in touch with my feelings, it was
an overwhelming transformation.... I found what I had always been
looking for &#8212; to love myself and be loved by other people.&quot;<br>
...<br>
Physicians in AA tend to believe that the principles of AA, and even
AA-style support groups, would be useful to all practicing physicians,
not just those who are chemically dependent. But there are plenty
of barriers in the wider medical community to accepting such a notion.<br>
...<br>
But perhaps the biggest barrier to medical acceptance of AA is that
this model is essentially spiritual rather than scientific in nature:
Belief in &quot;a power higher&quot; than oneself is regarded by most observers
as fundamental to the AA approach.<br>
...<br>
Certainly, however, the spiritual dimension that is so strong in AA
is at odds with the scientific, medical tradition. Says Dr. Ken:
&quot;We [physicians] tend to be analytical. Spirituality is a gut or
heart-felt experience that certainly can't be scientifically studied
and falls outside our training.&quot;
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Dr. Whitfield agrees that AA's effectiveness can't be explained in
scientific terms, or tested in controlled studies.
</font>
That makes it easy for physicians to reject AA, despite abundant
anecdotal evidence that the 12 Steps do work, at least for some people.
<p>
The scientific tradition in medicine is an understandable reaction
against quackery in the early part of this century, Dr. Whitfield
says, but this reaction has limited medicine's access to ideas that
work. &quot;Most physicians are limited by all-or-none thinking. They
say that it's either the spiritual, holistic approach [of AA] or
the scientific approach, and not both,&quot; he says.
<p>
<a name="traditional_treatment"> </a>
What's needed, he suggests, is an end to this &quot;all-or-none&quot; thinking
&#8212; an effort to weave the scientific tradition together with traditional
medicine into a richer healing strategy.<br>
...<br>
Says Dr. Earle: &quot;Our scientific training makes us want to know the
reason for everything. Once you don't have to know the reason for
everything, you're coming home, baby, you're really coming home.&quot;<br>

The eminent philosopher Erich Fromm wrote about hedonism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The concepts of Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, and Spencer have in common
the ideas ... that the subjective experience of pleasure is in itself
not a sufficient criterion of <i>value</i>; &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Psychoanalysis confirms the view, held by the opponents of hedonistic
ethics, that the subjective experience of satisfaction is in itself
deceptive and not a valid criterion of value. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hedonistic thinking failed to analyze the nature of pleasure sufficiently;
it thus made it appear as if that which is easiest in life &#8212; to have <i>some</i>
kind of pleasure &#8212; were at the same time that which is most valuable.
But nothing valuable is easy... &nbsp;
Humanistic ethics may very well postulate happiness  and joy as its chief virtues,
but in doing so it does not demand the easiest but <i>the most difficult
task of man, the full development of his productiveness.</i> &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... If a sick person has to endure a painful treatment, the end-view, his health,
does not make the treatment itself pleasureful; nor do the pains of childbirth
become pleasureful. In order to achieve a desired end we do many unpleasant things
only because our <i>reason</i> tells us that we have to do them.<br>

Worse yet, Anderson encourages an anti-intellectual mindlessness &#8212;
a sort of intellectual suicide &#8212; that can only make someone into less
of a person.
Anderson says that doctors can
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;really come home&quot;</font> to the cult if they just
stop thinking rationally. Well, Jim Jones' <i>People's Temple</i> had a doctor and
a nurse at Jonestown who had &quot;really come home, baby&quot; and stopped thinking rationally.
They were the ones who mixed up the cyanide Flavor-aid<sup>&reg;</sup>
for everyone to drink.
They killed 914 people, including 267 children, and they didn't even
think that what they were doing was wrong.
That's what can happen when you just stop thinking, and &quot;really come home&quot; to the cult.

<p>
Note the deceptive suggestion that physicians should combine
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;scientific tradition together with traditional medicine&quot;</font>
to get improved medicine.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Who says that &quot;traditional medicine&quot; is so wonderful?
&quot;Traditional medicine&quot; included leeches, blood-letting, the snake pit,
faith healing, and sundry other old quack medicine cures.
(But it didn't include Alcoholics Anonymous, which is a relatively new cult.)
</font>

<p>
The scientific tradition in medicine is not
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;an understandable reaction against quackery in the early part of
this century&quot;</font>,
as Dr. Whitfield stated.
The scientific tradition in medicine started in the eighteenth century and was responsible
for most of the advances in medicine in the last 250 years.

<p>
Also note that the statement that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The scientific tradition in medicine&quot; ...
&quot;has limited medicine's access to ideas that work&quot;</font>
is completely untrue, a total lie.
The scientific tradition is what gave us penicillin
instead of voodoo dolls.
Every American quack doctor who runs to Tijuana to set up a clinic that pushes
&quot;miraculous cancer cures&quot; or &quot;eternal youth potions&quot;
claims that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;science is keeping people from getting new ideas that work.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
No, science, including rigorous scientific testing of new medicines and treatments,
is keeping people from getting quack medicine that does not work.
</font>
<p>
Also note that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Dr. Whitfield agrees that AA's effectiveness can't be explained
in scientific terms, or tested in controlled studies.&quot;<br>
</font>

What that really means is,
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">A.A. doesn't work. It isn't

That's why it fails every real test. The reason that
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_magical">they can't explain how it works</a>
is because it doesn't work.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
And the so-called
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#anecdote">abundant anecdotal evidence</a>
that the 12 Steps do work&quot;</i>, about which Thomas Anderson wrote, is completely worthless.
That is just a few people
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational">telling cherry-picked stories</a>.
Just because some people are confused about cause and effect relationships,
and have been fooled into thinking that the 12 steps did something for them,
and then tell stories about those beliefs,
does not prove that the 12 Steps actually worked and cured patients.
For many centuries, quack doctors, snake oil salesmen, and fake
faith healers have been
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#quack_testimonials">making plenty of
money by taking advantage of such confusion</a> &#8212;
constantly repeating grandiose anecdotal stories of allegedly wonderful
successful cures that came from using snake oil and voodoo charms.

<p>
Those few people who actually do quit drinking while going to A.A. meetings
are mostly just those people who were going to quit anyway &#8212;
<i><a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Robertson_already_quit">or who
have already quit</a></i> &#8212; because they got sick and tired of being sick
and tired, and decided to save their own lives. They do the hard work of quitting,
and then A.A. takes the credit for their work, and claims that it somehow
made them quit.

The Twelve Steps themselves, as an alcohol treatment
program, are flat-out insane.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The Twelve Steps do not even mention quitting drinking, or sobriety, or
health, or helping anyone else to quit drinking. They are all about
admitting that you are powerless and insane, and surrendering to the will of God
and listing and confessing your sins, and then recruiting more cult members.
<li> Declaring yourself to be powerless over alcohol, and insane, as you
do in Steps One and Two, and then begging God to give you just one
day of sobriety, really is insane.<br>
<li> In the Twelve Steps, we are not supposed to fix ourselves or heal ourselves &#8212;
we just beg God to remove all of our &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
in Step Seven. And if the Lord won't do it for us, then we are in big trouble.
<li> We are never given anything like a reasonable logical explanation of how
the 12 steps are supposed to actually work to make someone quit drinking.
As mentioned in the quote above, you aren't supposed to ask for
&quot;the reason for everything&quot;. You are supposed to &quot;just have faith.&quot;
The true believers are not bothered by this. They believe that
the steps work in some magical non-logical &quot;spiritual&quot; way to
cause one to abstain from drinking alcohol.

</ul>
<p>
Declaring that you are done with self-seeking and selfishness,
as the Big Book demands,
is crazy: What could be more self-seeking than trying to save your
own life?
It is impossible to seek sobriety, &quot;Gratitude&quot;,
and &quot;Serenity&quot; for yourself without being at least a little
selfish and self-seeking.
Such demands for elimination of self and selfishness are suitable for
brainwashing a candidate, in preparation for surrendering to the cult,
but not for building up his ability to resist cravings for alcohol &#8212;
and certainly not appropriate for building him up so he can live the
rest of his life as a competent, functioning adult, healthy and free.

<p>
It is insane to declare,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I'm insane. But that's okay, because <i>I have come to believe</i>
that the ghosts and spirits and demons that hide in the walls are going
to fix my brain and restore me to sanity.&quot;</font>
<p>
If you hear someone talking like that, you have to ask,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Have you been remembering to take your medications?&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
But if someone says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I'm insane. But that's okay, because <i>I have come to believe</i>
that my <i>Higher Power</i> is going
to fix my brain and restore me to sanity&quot;</font>,
then you are supposed to accept that as a sane religious belief.<br>

<p>
In A.A., there is a popular saying:
&quot;It is insane to keep on doing the same old things you've always
been doing, and expect to get different results.&quot;<br>
<p>
Yes, and it is insane to keep on doing the Twelve Steps and expecting them
to suddenly start working for you
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">when they never did before</a>.
And it is insane to expect the Twelve Steps to work for newcomers when
the Steps <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment">fail more
than 99% of all of the people</a> who try them.
<p>
<a name="solve_all">
It is insane</a> to go around babbling lines out of the
<i>Big Book</i> like:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual
principles would solve all my problems.&quot;</i>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, Chapter 3, page 42.)</font>
Does that mean that spiritual principles will pay the
rent and utilities, and go to work when I don't feel like it?
Will spiritual principles keep me from getting old? Cure cancer?
Cure male pattern baldness?
Replace my teeth?
Get rid of cellulite and varicose veins?
Dump 30 or 40 pounds of ugly fat? Get me laid? How?
Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>
It is irrational to imagine that you can cure all of your drug and alcohol
problems by hanging out with a bunch of group
members who brag that they can't quit drinking or drugging by themselves
because they are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
(And who often really don't quit &#8212; they relapse.)
Remember the popular slogan,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Quitting isn't an option for addicts like us&quot;?
</font>
Well then, the logical, healthy, sane thing to do is go find some
people for whom quitting definitely <b>IS</b> an option.
<p>
(Hint: try <a href="orange-bibliography.html#SMART" target="_blank">SMART</a>. That is,
<i>Self Management And Recovery Training</i>.
They use common sense and simple logic to quit and stay quit.

Above all, A.A. gets a 10 for insisting on curing a medical
and psychological problem, the
habitual excessive consumption of alcohol, with a &quot;spiritual&quot; cure.
The only other well-known groups
that insist on curing medical problems with spiritual cures are
the Christian Scientists, who won't take
their children to a doctor even if their kids are dying
(<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Let God heal the children, and if they die, then
it is God's will&quot;</font>), and some aboriginal witch doctors and
medicine men. Please note that, in fairness
to them, I say &quot;some&quot; witch doctors and medicine men,
because even most of them are happy to mix
Western medicine with native herbal cures and then throw in some
spiritual stuff, chanting and rattle shaking, for flavoring.

But the twelve-step true believers are not so reasonable: One
friend of mine is in dual recovery,
meaning that he is recovering from both mental problems, and
also drugs and alcohol. Like so many other people, he had tried to
fix his mental problems by self-medicating with drugs and alcohol,
and it didn't work. His doctor has
him taking anti-depressants and mood stabilizers for his mental
condition, and he does fine on them. He isn't crazy; he just has a
brain chemistry imbalance &#8212; he can't
stand even the tiniest, slightest little bit of frustration unless he is on Paxil.
Then he can keep things on an even keel, and he can cope with life.
<p>
Alas, some of the old-timer faithful in his
twelve-step recovery group, including his sponsor, are
telling him to stop taking the pills that
the doctor gives him, and just trust the Twelve Steps to heal
him. That borders on criminal irresponsibility.
<p>
It is also practicing medicine without a
license, because they are countermanding the
orders of a real doctor.
<p>

It is also practicing medicine without any training &#8212; those fools
have never gone to medical school. Attending A.A. meetings for a few years does
not make someone a competent doctor or psychiatrist.
<p>
Fortunately, my friend is following his doctor's orders.
(Although he worries me &#8212; those nuts are getting to him &#8212;
he is saying things like,
&quot;Still, I wonder if I can make it without medications...&quot;
He never did before. He freaked out and relapsed every time.)

Alas, I just learned that the question has essentially been
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826083540/http://www.cris.com/~kenr1/commonsense/12steps/checklist.shtml">answered</a>:
In one group, an elder with 35 years of sobriety told a newcomer,
a young man, that his sobriety was no good because he was taking
medication for high blood pressure.
The newcomer, on the advice of the elder, quit his medication, had
a stroke, and is now crippled for life. Was the elder held accountable
to anyone? No.

My experiences here seem to be far from unique.
This story is equally appalling. A young man with mental problems
and a need for medications
was arrested for a domestic disturbance, and his A.A. sponsor
gave the medical opinion that he should be kept in jail and
&quot;detoxed&quot;:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After Achen was booked into the jail, and his
sisters had found out where he was, they debated
whether to provide bail. But after talking with their
brother's Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, they decided
against it. In a deposition, Deming said the sponsor
assured her that Achen would be safe where he was,
that he would detox and that she wouldn't have to
worry about him.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It took the medical staff six days to verify Achen's prescriptions, and
the inmate was finally provided with Risperadol and Zoloft seven days
after he arrived.
Lee, Achen's outside physician, also 
authorized the drugs Klonopin, an anti-anxiety and
anti-seizure medication, and Wellbutrin for anxiety.
In his deposition, he explained that he considered
the Risperadol &quot;perhaps [the] most important for
[Achen's] mental stability,&quot; and he wanted Achen &quot;to
take it every night regularly&quot; to be effective but
that the patient had been taking it erratically.<br>

<p>
Achen got only some of his doctor-prescribed medications on his 7th day in jail,
and committed suicide on his 11th day.
<p>
The family is suing the jail, the sheriff's department, and the doctor,
but <i>not</i> the sponsor. Nobody is holding the sponsor culpable for anything,
even though he dispensed quack medical advice that killed the patient.

As Gary Persip points out in
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Gary_Persip"><i>Recovery From Addiction Without God?</i></a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have even heard sponsors advising those they sponsor to
refrain from using medications that were prescribed by
professionals and, presumably, deemed necessary for the
treatment of other medical or psychological problems of
the individuals.

Occasionally, sponsees will admit that they
haven't informed their sponsors of medically prescribed drugs they
are taking for fear of a critical response.<br>
 ...<br>
Medications of any kind are disparaged, and any diagnosis
of disorder other than the Big Book's disease concept of
alcoholism meets with strong opposition. The parallel with
&quot;faith healing&quot;
should be obvious and the same pitfalls are present. To
such individuals, there is no such thing as clinical
depression.<br>
 ...<br>
The many deaths that have been attributed to failure to obtain
adequate medical treatment observed among family members of
a number of &quot;natural&quot; religious groups comes to mind as a
parallel case. How many disasters, including death, has this
misguided practice of A.A. members contributed to?

On what
basis do so many A.A. members assume that they are qualified
to advise on matters for which they have no training? The
practice, as has been noted, is in sharp contradiction to those
Traditions that state that we share only our experiences,
strength and hopes with one another, not our opinions.<br>

<p>
The &quot;many deaths&quot; phrase above is unfortunately turning
out to be just too true. I recently talked with yet another ex-member
old-timer who quit in anger, and hates A.A., because other old-timer
sponsors kept telling mental cases to quit taking their medications,
and then those sad cases committed suicide.
His parting words to those A.A. members, after another funeral, were:<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Well, before you guys got ahold of him, at least he
could say his own name.<br>
But when you were done with him, he couldn't even do that.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Were the old-timers who talked the patient into quitting his medications
disciplined or held responsible for their actions? No. Were they forced to
quit sponsoring in such a manner? No.
<p>
Also see
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">this list of stories of suicides
in Alcoholics Anonymous</a>
that readers have sent in.
<p>
And the true believers just won't accept any responsibility for their
actions, or admit that they did anything wrong, or quit doing it.
(This is exactly the same thing as Rebecca Fransway has
reported in her book,
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#horror_stories"><i>AA Horror Stories</i></a>.)
Of course not. It is in the nature of <i>true believers</i> to never question
their own beliefs.
They want to hold all of
their beliefs with absolute certainty</a>.
(See Eric Hoffer's book,
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#True_Believer"><i>The True Believer</i></a>.)
So,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The Twelve Steps are such powerful magic that they can
heal all such problems, and people should just quit taking those medications.
There is no question about it; there is nothing to discuss. Everybody knows
you are better off if you aren't popping pills.&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
One of the favorite A.A. slogans is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are the experts on addiction.&quot;
</font>
Obviously, they are not.
They are often some of the worst drug and alcohol counselors in the
world,
counselors who stupidly kill their patients, counselors who are so
incompetent that they won't even learn from their own mistakes.
A.A. sponsors,
unlike real doctors, never do post-mortems to study which treatments
worked and which failed.<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
In A.A. there <i>is</i> only one treatment program &#8212; the Twelve Steps &#8212; and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;of course 'our simple program' never fails if you give yourself
to it completely&quot;</font> and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed
our path</i>&quot;</font>, etc., etc..

<p>
Recently, I ran into
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Carolyn_See">an article by Carolyn See</a>,
the step-daughter of Wynn (Corum) See,
who was the authoress of the <i>Big Book</i> story &quot;Freedom From Bondage&quot;</i>,
and another one of Bill Wilson's paramours.
Carolyn reported that during her childhood she heard the early A.A. members arguing about
whether taking aspirin for a headache constituted a slip from sobriety.
<p>
They were nuts.

<p><center><hr width="33%"></center><p>

Another irrational facet of A.A. is belief in the old
Buchmanism&#8212;Oxford Group Movement's tenet
that all of the problems of the world are due to sin. Nothing
else is relevant, not poverty, politics, the environment,
education or lack thereof,
medical issues like physical or mental illness,
or social issues like racism, sexism, or child abuse.
The cure to everything, they say, is to
get people on their knees, confessing their sins and defects of
character, and begging God to fix them.
Thus A.A. will not do anything to fix the problems of society. A.A.
won't do anything about the causes
of alcoholism &#8212; A.A. just says that the causes of alcoholism are that
it's a hereditary &quot;spiritual&quot; disease and
that people are sinful, and that the cure is abstinence and prayer,
and doing the Twelve Steps, and going to meetings,
and surrendering your will and your life to God.
Basically, the A.A. members <i>don't do anything</i> except sit on their asses
in meetings and talk about drinking, the Twelve Steps, A.A., and God (and then
go try to recruit more A.A. members).


<p><center><hr width="33%"></center><p>

<a name="spiritual_disease"> </a>
A.A. claims that alcoholism is a
&quot;spiritual disease, which requires a
spiritual cure.&quot; Neither the American Medical Association,
nor the American Psychiatric Association
(<a name="DSM_ret2">in</a> <a href="orange-bibliography.html#dsm3">DSM-III-R</a> or
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#dsm4">DSM-IV</a>),
recognize the existence of any such thing as a
&quot;spiritual disease.&quot; And neither does the
Roman Catholic Church. Nor does any Protestant church that I
know of, other than the
Buchmanism / Oxford Group Movement / Moral Re-Armament gang. But A.A.
is convinced that
alcoholism is a spiritual disease, often caused by bad genetics,
where the disease is passed from father
to son. How is a genetic defect a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;?
This is crazy.

<p>
I would like to study this new field of medicine further, these
&quot;spiritual diseases.&quot; Unfortunately, Bill Wilson
didn't ever bother to define just what a spiritual disease was, or
even bother to list them all. But Bill did give us a hint about
the etiology of the diseases:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'Resentment is the &quot;number one&quot; offender.
It destroys more alcoholics than anything else.
From it stem all forms of spiritual disease...'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I'd really like to know what all of those forms
of spiritual disease
are, so I can save my life from them, but Bill Wilson never
bothered to elaborate. Nowhere else in the <i>Big Book</i>
did Bill give us any more details about spiritual diseases, not a word.

<p>
In Bill's second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, on page 49, Bill said that
fear is &quot;a soul-sickness in its own right.&quot;
Maybe a &quot;soul-sickness&quot; is a &quot;spiritual disease,&quot;
and maybe not.
And maybe &quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunk</a>&quot; is a spiritual disease,
and maybe it isn't. Unfortunately, Bill just tossed that very
important concept, &quot;spiritual disease&quot; out there, without
any definition, or explanation or elaboration at all.
<p>
We indirectly get a few more shreds of information about spiritual
diseases from the recruiting literature of other 12-step groups.
To wit, sometimes spiritual diseases are contagious, like cooties:
<ul>
<li>
The wife of an alcoholic can allegedly contract the spiritual disease of
&quot;co-dependency&quot;
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Molloy_quote">just from being married to the guy</a>.
The poor wife must spend the rest of her life in Al-Anon meetings,
doing the Twelve Steps, confessing her sins and recruiting others,
without hope of recovery, just because her husband drank alcohol.
<li>
Likewise, the children of the marriage either inherit the gene for
alcoholism or get infected with something like co-dependency, so that
they too must attend Al-Anon or Alateen or ACOA
(Adult Children of Alcoholics)
meetings and do the Twelve Steps for the rest of their lives.
<li>
We don't know how much danger of infection the friends and co-workers
of alcoholics are in.
</ul>

<p>
We know little more about
spiritual diseases than that they are a very strange breed of
disease that can only be treated by meeting in basements,
drinking bad coffee, smoking cigarettes, and talking to the wall
about how unhappy you are.
And yet, I hear the self-appointed gurus telling the newcomers that
alcoholism is a spiritual disease that requires a spiritual cure.
<p>
<a name="emotional_confusion"> </a>
<p>
Bill's references to spiritual diseases
or illnesses reveal that he really couldn't
distinguish between emotional problems and
spiritual diseases. Resentment, anger, fear, and frustration
are emotional problems, not &quot;spiritual diseases.&quot;
The habitual consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol is
certainly an emotional illness &#8212; a psychological problem, and
it causes physical medical problems. It is much more than just a bad habit
when the drinker continues to drink in spite of all of the harm
that it is causing him: health problems, job loss, poverty, marital
problems, and sometimes even death.
It's an emotional problem when he believes that he must drink alcohol
in order to be happy.
And it becomes a psychiatric
disease when enough brain damage accumulates and he gets something like
<i>Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</i>. But when does it
become a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Does the alcoholic drink too much because he has the
&quot;spiritual disease&quot;, or does he have the
&quot;spiritual disease&quot; because he drinks too much?<br>
Does he crave alcohol because he is evil, or is he
evil because he craves alcohol?<br>

<a name="tobacco"> </a>
<ul>
<li> Why don't badly
addicted, dying, cigarette smokers have the spiritual disease
&quot;nicotinism&quot; or &quot;tobaccoism&quot;?
<li> Why don't compulsive coffee guzzlers have the spiritual
disease &quot;caffeinism&quot; or &quot;Starbuckism&quot;?
<li> Why aren't those people
labeled &quot;coffeeholics&quot; and &quot;tobaccoholics&quot;,
and forced to get Twelve-Step treatment?
<li> Why don't junkies have the spiritual disease &quot;heroinism&quot;?
<li> Why don't speed freaks have &quot;crankism,&quot;
&quot;speedism,&quot; or &quot;amphetaminism&quot;?
<li> Why don't coke heads have &quot;cocainism&quot;?
<li> And why don't glue sniffers get stuck with the label
&quot;glueaholics&quot; &#8212; unfortunate people who suffer from the
deadly, incurable, progressive spiritual disease of &quot;glueism&quot;?
</ul>

Why not? Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>
Why does Alcoholics Anonymous say that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">cigarette and tobacco addictions
are perfectly okay</a>,
and even openly encourage them at meetings,<br>

<ul>
<li> ... in spite of the fact that one of the founders of A.A., Bill
Wilson, died from cigarette smoking? (Specifically, Bill W.
died of emphysema and pneumonia, desperately, futilely gasping for
another breath, after having lived off of an oxygen tank
for his last few years.)
<li> ... in spite of the fact that today, 61 million Americans are hooked
on tobacco, 15 to 20 million are alcoholics, and 5 or 6 million are
on illegal drugs?
(Note that there is considerable overlap between the three groups).
(<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Addiction_Nemesis"><i>Addiction Nemesis</i></a>,
Robert R. Selle, 2001.)
<li> ... and in spite of the fact that tobacco kills three or four times
as many Americans each year as does alcohol? (Tobacco kills 420,000
Americans per year. Alcohol kills 100,000, and fatal auto accidents
involving alcohol kill roughly another 13 thousand Americans per year.)
<li> ... and in spite of the fact that <b>more alcoholics die from
tobacco than from alcohol</b>? &#8212; That is, eighty or ninety percent of all
alcoholics also smoke, and more than half of the time, the tobacco
kills them before the alcohol does.
</ul>
<p>
So why isn't &quot;tobaccoism&quot; a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;?
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">How can such a horribly
destructive drug be an integral part of a &quot;spiritual&quot; life?</a>
How can dying of emphysema and lung cancer be a program of &quot;recovery&quot;?
<p>
Why do the A.A. smokers hang around the 12-step clubhouse,
puffing on cigarettes between and after meetings,
while bragging about how great their &quot;recovery&quot; is going?
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#BF0000"><b>What is so damn wonderful about
dying of emphysema and lung cancer sober?</b></font>
<p>

<p>
<a name="Nicotine_Anonymous"> </a>
Oh, by the way, there really is a Nicotine Anonymous 12-step
group, whose First Step says that
they are powerless over nicotine. In their twelfth step, they
only call themselves &quot;nicotine users&quot;,
not &quot;nicotinaholics&quot;, or &quot;tobaccoholics.&quot;
But in their Fifth Tradition, they say that their mission is to
&quot;carry the message&quot; to other &quot;nicotine addicts.&quot;
<p>
This leaves us with a really funny situation at a lot of
Twelve-Step clubhouses, where all of the Alcoholics Anonymous and
Narcotics Anonymous people
are compulsively sucking on cigarettes during smoke breaks, and
rationalizing it by saying that it isn't as bad as drinking, and
it's okay because Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob did it,
while in another room other people are grovelling before God,
and confessing that they are weak and sinful and powerless over
nicotine, and their lives have become
unmanageable, and they are such stupid sinful worthless addicted
jerks because they smoke cigarettes.
<p>
Go figure.
<p>
Oh, and as if that weren't enough, there is also a Caffeine
Anonymous twelve-step group meeting in the next room...

<p>
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------
<font color="blue">
The truth is,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
the 12 Steps don't work at all</a>. Even one of the leaders
of A.A., Professor George E. Vaillant of Harvard University, who is a
member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Inc., says so. His eight-year longitudinal study found
that A.A. treatment did not help the alcoholics at all, and
just increased the death rate.

<li> God doesn't have anything better to do with His time than attend A.A. meetings
and make people quit drinking.

<li> That alcoholism is not actually caused by drinking alcohol &#8212; that it is really caused
by unconfessed sins and secrets.

<li> That confessing their sins to another A.A. member will make people quit drinking alcohol.
<li> That a lot of grovelling confession sessions will make people

<li> That God will take care of A.A. members, and take care of their wills and their lives
for them,
and take away all of their difficulties and solve all of their problems,
for no particular reason other than that the alcoholics joined Bill Wilson's organization
and confessed their sins.

Step Seven in particular really stretches one's credibility.
Step Seven actually demands a miracle from God:<br>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>&quot;7. We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<P>
And God has to do it, or else He will blow the whole 12-step program.
The Twelve Steps cannot possibly work without this step.
Step Seven is the heart of the entire A.A. self-improvement
routine:
<font color="#9F0000">
You just wait for God to fix you.</font> Literally. The rest of the
steps involve making lists of all of your faults, wrongs, defects
of character, and shortcomings, and
making more lists of all of the people you have harmed, and making
amends, and wallowing in guilt, confessing your sins,
but no other step actually deals with fixing yourself.
If God doesn't fix you, then you are screwed.
So we will all just &quot;come to believe&quot; that God will fix us
and make us quit drinking, just because we humbly ask Him to.
------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
<!-----------------------------------------------------------------
And He will, Bill says:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor.<br>
...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it.<br>
...<br>
We have not even sworn off.  Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>

<P>
According to Bill Wilson, recovery from alcoholism is effortless:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It just comes. That is the miracle of it.&quot;</i></font><br>
We don't have to do a thing. Our problems are magically solved
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;without any thought or effort on our part.&quot;</i></font>
That is obviously
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">completely delusional nonsense</a>.
<P>
(Shouldn't <i>&quot;without any thought or effort on our part&quot;</i> mean
that we don't have to do the 12 Steps or go to A.A. meetings?)



<p>
For that matter, the Steps demand a few more miracles from God, too.<br>

<ul>
<LI> In Step One, we admit that we are powerless over alcohol, so God has to
somehow manage our alcohol consumption for us.<br>

<LI> In Step Two, we confess that we are insane, and come to believe that only
God (a &quot;Power greater than ourselves&quot;) can restore us to sanity,
so God has to do it, or else we stay insane.<br>

<LI> In Step Eleven, God is supposed to talk to us, and tell us more about Himself,
and then give us our orders for the day and the power to carry them out.<br>

</ul>

So God has to do a lot of things for us, whether He really wishes to
be bothered by us or not.
------------------------------------------------------------->

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------

<p><br>
Step Twelve is pretty unbelievable too. It begins, &quot;Having
had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps...&quot;
(<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience">It originally
read &quot;Having had a spiritual experience...&quot;</a>)
Oh yeh? Most people have to wait their entire lives for a genuine
spiritual experience, or awakening, or whatever you want to call it,
and all of the A.A. members get one just for doing the preceding eleven
steps? I don't think so.
<p>
On a side note, how are we to distinguish between mental
awakenings and spiritual awakenings?
Just quitting drinking, and letting the brain heal some of the
damage, can produce <b>delightful</b>
awakenings and moments of sudden clarity. When do these become
&quot;spiritual&quot; awakenings?

<p>
Also, many alcoholics report having hallucinations, visions, awakenings,
and spiritual experiences while detoxing and going through DT's
(Delirium Tremens, which is notorious for making alcoholics see pink elephants).
Those alcoholics sometimes have very powerful, even life-changing, visions and experiences,
all without ever having done any of the Twelve Steps. Bill Wilson, one
of the two co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, was such a person.

<a name="not12"> </a>
<P>
Bill changed from a hopeless
drinking-to-die alcoholic to a lifelong teetotaler, from just
three or four days of tripping on alcohol
withdrawal, delirium tremens, and numerous drugs, and &quot;seeing God&quot;,
when he detoxed for the last time, December 11 to 15, 1934,
at the Charles B. Towns Hospital in New York City.

Dr. Silkworth gave Bill Wilson the specialty of the house,
the &quot;Belladonna cure&quot;,
which was quite a potent drug cocktail,
consisting of morphine, megavitamins, barbiturates,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">the
hallucinogenic drugs belladonna and henbane</a>,
and sundry other psychoactive drugs.

While tripping on that stuff, Bill Wilson had a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience">
&quot;spiritual experience&quot;</a>,
and &quot;saw the White Light&quot; and saw
&quot;the God of the Preachers.&quot;
That happened on December 14, 1934.
Bill Wilson wrote up his Twelve Steps four years later,
in December, 1938, so it wasn't the Twelve Steps that gave Bill
Wilson either his vision of God or his sobriety.
<p>

But A.A. still wants us to believe that we will get our
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience">
&quot;religious experience&quot;, &quot;spiritual experience&quot;,
or &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;</a>,
from doing Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps, and not from taking drugs.<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Keep An Open Mind. Heck, you never know, it might actually
happen.&quot;</i>
</font>
<P>
Yes, and the sky might actually fall, too... But I don't think so.

--------------------------------------------------------------->

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To hear the faithful tell it, God performs miracles like
removing moral shortcomings from A.A.
members, and making them quit drinking,
and giving them spiritual experiences,
every day, and God doesn't seem to have much else to do with His time
besides granting Twelve-Stepper's
wishes, and managing their lives, and taking care of their wills for them,
and making everything else turn out
okay too. And God has to do it,
because the A.A. members turned their wills and their lives over to
the care of God back in Step Three,
and they don't expect to do it for themselves.
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Let Go and Let God&quot;</font>
is their official motto, and narcissistic passive dependency
is their official approach to life.
(That means: being as helpless, as &quot;powerless&quot;,
as a baby, and passively laying on their backsides and just waiting for
Big Mommy or Big Daddy to take care of them and solve all of their
problems for them.)
<p>
Both the <i>Big Book</i> and members sharing in meetings say things like:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have no other explanation for the many good things that have
happened to me since I have been in A.A. &#8212; they came to me
from a Greater Power.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>,
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, page 367.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>Isn't it funny that A.A. members get
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand">miracles on demand</a>,
and have God working for them every day, as their reward for
having drunk too much alcohol for too many years, while
all of the ordinary people in the world still have to take care of
themselves and solve their own problems?</b>
</font>
<p>
Well, if you can believe all of that, then you get
10 Brownie Points for suspension of disbelief.
(<i>Oh, and I also have a wonderful old bridge in Brooklyn that
I'll sell you, real cheap.</i>)

<p>
That point also begs the question: &quot;What about AIDS and Africa?&quot;
There are twenty million people in Africa who are doomed,
condemned to a really slow, horrendous death, being slowly eaten alive
by opportunistic diseases, without any medicines to treat
the AIDS because the drugs are too expensive and those people
are just too poor. Their whole country is just too poor.
God isn't giving them any miracles on demand, and they sure
are praying for some. But some white alcohol drinkers in the USA who hold
an A.A. meeting have God waiting on them hand and foot,
removing their moral shortcomings and defects of character, and sparing them from
a horrible alcoholic death just because the nice
white Americans asked for a favor? As Bubba's Momma asked in the movie <i>Forest Gump</i>,
&quot;Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?&quot;

such a literal life saver for millions of people, but it also provided
a formula for countless individuals to learn how to live life based upon
spiritual principles that align with the metaphysical laws that actually

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;... Alcoholics Anonymous is a spiritual program, not a religious one.
It is important to note the difference.&quot; &nbsp; ...<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Religion is more structured and external. Spirituality is freer, more
personal, broader. Ideally,&quot; Jerry added, &quot;religion helps you
achieve spirituality, but if it doesn't, then set it aside for a
while.&quot;<br>

<p>
So if your own religion isn't exactly like Alcoholics Anonymous, then
&quot;set it aside&quot; and just do the A.A. practices.
&quot;For a while&quot; will end up being forever.

It's quite a show to watch the hard-core A.A. true believers go
nonlinear when you mention Rational Recovery or Secular Organizations
for Sobriety... And again, A.A. insists that it has the
<i><b>only</b></i> working answer to alcoholism, and those other
groups are killing all of the people who go to them.

<i>&quot;The Small Book&quot;</i>.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;What?! Isn't that the one without the Higher Power?!&quot;
</font>
Then he told us
that Rational Recovery's AVRT technique (Addictive Voice
Recognition Therapy) is just so complex
and difficult that you will die before you figure it out, so
don't mess with it.

<p>
Not! AVRT is actually just a process of recognizing the thoughts
that are the voice of
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">the
Addiction Monster</a>, aka the Beast (the base brain, really), as it
tempts you to take a drink. It is pathetically easy, once you get
the hang of it. It is just like those Walt Disney cartoons with
Donald Duck having a little devil on one shoulder, and a little
angel on the other, and the little devil is whispering into Donald's
ear,
&quot;Smoke! Drink! It will be fun!&quot;
<p>
Children can understand that cartoon, but my
A.A.-indoctrinated counselor says that recognizing that situation
as it is happening is much too difficult for you or I (or him) to do,
so Rational Recovery is confusing people into drinking themselves to
death.

<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks">10</a>.
<i>Personal attacks on critics.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The A.A. true believers accuse critics of killing alcoholics
by confusing them, and misleading them into drinking,
and by discouraging them from going to the only program
that could save them from death.
The A.A. true believers say that critics are
&quot;<a href="orange-disservice.html" target="_blank">doing a great
disservice to those who are seeking sobriety</a>.&quot;
(This of course assumes that the
A.A. program actually works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">which it doesn't</a>.)
<li> A.A. accuses critics of only being in it for the money, and of
having other ulterior motives.
<li> They accuse critics of being bitter, unhappy, angry, or insane.
<li> They resort to name-calling, saying that critics are
&quot;AA-bashers&quot;, who are on &quot;an anti-AA pogrom.&quot;
<li> The A.A. true believers assume smug patronizing attitudes and
make condescending remarks about how the critic doesn't know what
he is talking about, because he isn't an alcoholic.
<li> Or, A.A. members will accuse a critic of being drunk, or a &quot;practicing alcoholic&quot;.
<li> But if the critic is a recovered alcoholic, they call him a
&quot;dry drunk,&quot; and say that he is &quot;in denial&quot;
or crazy, or say that he wasn't a member long enough to know,
or hasn't done The Steps long enough to
&quot;<a href="orange-letters.html#find_out">find out what it
is all about</a>.&quot;
<li> The tone of their attacks is usually angry, hateful, sarcastic,
and condescending &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Enjoy your next DUI, pusswad!&quot;</font>
(Which is how the
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunks</a>&quot;
are supposed to feel about
everything, because they <i>don't</i> do the Twelve Steps. The
True Believers are supposed to feel &quot;Serene and Grateful&quot;
from doing the Twelve Steps. They don't.)
<li> The attitude of the true believers is completely hypocritical.
They say that they offer unconditional love and complete acceptance,
but their attitude is, <i>&quot;Don't fuck with us, or else!&quot;</i>
</ul>
<p>
Typically, one of the
<a href="orange-letters.html#find_out">very first critical emails</a>
that I received for this web site was,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Thanks for the good laughs, now why don't you get a copy of the
big book and study it and find out what AA is really about?&quot;
</font>
I replied that I owned two copies of the <i>Big Book</i>, and that one of
them was heavily highlighted with all of the quotes that I put in
my web pages. Then I asked him which quote out of the <i>Big Book</i>
or <i>12X12</i> (<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>) was incorrect.
He never answered back...

<p>
A.A. members mount smear campaigns against critics, often using their
front groups like ASAM (the American Society of Addiction Medicine),
NCADD (the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence), and
the NAADAC (the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse
Counselors), and their network of addiction treatment professionals
<i>who hide their A.A. membership while attacking the critic</i>.

<p>
What A.A. will not do is calmly, politely, logically, debate the
facts with critics, and participate in fair, unbiased testing and
experimentation to prove whether the program really works. Above
all, they seem to fear being put to the test, because they have
little to gain and a lot to lose, because all of the valid randomized
tests that have been done indicate that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">A.A. &quot;treatment&quot;
is worse than <i>no treatment at all</i></a>.

<p>
It is also funny that A.A. readily accuses critics or
competing treatment programs of killing
patients, but A.A. will never even consider the possibility that A.A.
might kill patients. A.A. is always
claiming that they save lives, and they will quickly, at the drop
of a hat, trot out a short chorus line
of old-timers who all swear that A.A. saved their lives, but A.A.
does not even seem to consider it possible for
A.A. to kill a patient. That is illogical.
If meeting-style treatment or Twelve-Step treatment is so
powerful that it can save lives, then it must also be powerful
enough to destroy lives, if it is misapplied or misused.

<a name="rigorous"> </a>
But A.A. just arrogantly claims that the 98% or 99% of the
newcomers for whom the program doesn't work are all just<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;constitutionally incapable of being honest with
themselves,&quot;</i><br></font>
and<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;naturally incapable of grasping and developing a
manner of life which demands rigorous honesty.&quot;</i>
</font>
(The <i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)<br>

<b>Humility:</b>
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, page 72, says:
&quot;That basic ingredient of all humility, a desire to
seek and do God's will, was missing.&quot;
So all of the appeals for humility are really appeals for
obedience to God's will, as William Wilson saw it.

The A.A. slogan is &quot;Let Go Of Old Ideas.&quot;<br>
Oh really? What about these old ideas?<br>
<ol>
<li> Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
<li> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be known as the children of God.
<li> Thou shalt not kill.
<li> Thou shalt not lie.
<li> Thou shalt not steal.
<li> Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife...
<li> etc....
