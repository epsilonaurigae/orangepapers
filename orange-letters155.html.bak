<p>
You must be one of the most brilliant authors I have ever read.
To think you would spend this much time or in your case probably very little
(because of your intelligence) trying to stop people from using any means at all to
stay sober or clean. What would you achieve by stopping one person from becoming
sober? Living with an alcoholic and an addict, I would support any program they
were to believe in.
<p>
You clearly have never felt the abuse of an alcoholic or addict.
<p>
Why in God's name would someone as brilliant as yourself not spend your time helping
to find cures and helping people.
<p>
I cannot  imagine where you energy would lead you. I am so jealous of someone as
brilliant as yourself.
<p>
My son does not believe in AA but I take him for my sake. He is very intelligent and
has nothing left. I guess he has someone like you to fuel his argument.
<p>
I know many AA members who as often as they fail will always keep trying. And of
course there are many brilliant people as yourself. I have tried to quit smoking
many times and have always failed for lack of will power.
<p>
Please excuse my lack of study to respond with any intelligence.
<p>
Who ever you are and now that my pathetic son thinks of you as a genius use what you
have to save one life.  You are truly blessed.
<p>
A not so brilliant mom.

<font color="blue">
Hello Sylvia,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Unfortunately, you have made one wrong assumption, and
that is that A.A. actually works to make people get sober. It does not.
(<a href="orange-letters141.html#tests" target="newwin86">Look here</a>.)
<p>
I am not
<font color="black">
 &quot;trying to stop people from using any means at all to
stay sober or clean&quot;</font>.
  I am trying to keep people from being deceived and hurt by
quack medicine that does not work.

<p>
When you say,
<font color="black">
 &quot;My son does not believe in AA but I take him for my sake&quot;</font>, you are
revealing that A.A. is a religion, not a treatment program for alcohol abuse.

A religion requires that you believe. Medicine does not. I have never had a doctor
ask me,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Do you believe in Western medicine? Do you believe in antibiotics?&quot;
</font>
Never. Not once, ever. The doctor just writes out a prescription, and
I take the pills, and they work, and I get better.  Beliefs are irrelevant.

<p>
When they tell you that
<a href="orange-jokes.html#TV_repair" target="newwin44">
 you must believe in order for the cure to work</a>, that is a
dead give-away of a con artist shoving a fraud on you.
(And of course, when the cure doesn't work, it is supposedly your fault because you
didn't believe, or you didn't pray enough, or you didn't &quot;work the program&quot; right.)

<p>
Speaking of beliefs, you said,
<font color="black">
&quot;I would support any program they were to believe in.&quot;
</font>
I would not. I would support any program or treatment that really works to cure addiction.
Erroneous beliefs are worse than worthless. They waste peoples' time and keep
them from getting something that works.

<p>
You also said,

<font color="black">
&quot;You clearly have never felt the abuse of an alcoholic or addict.&quot;
</font>
Alas, I grew up the son of an abusive mean alcoholic sergeant father. And then I
drank too much for nearly 20 years myself. I know all about it. That's why I
support anything that works to cure or alleviate alcohol addiction and alcohol abuse.
And that is why I am so opposed to quackery that is just a fraud that does not help
my friends.

<p>
And we do spend a lot of time here talking about what works to help alcoholics and
addicts. The lists start
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin38">here</a>.

Subject:  	A question<br>
Date:  	Sun, December 13, 2009 12:36 pm<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I don't want to drag you into a political debate, but rather to ask you a
question.  It is somewhat off topic, but it is in direct reference to
something you said in an essay.  I have enough of a sense that you're an
honest man to believe that &quot;the truth&quot; matters to you, and that you wouldn't
let your political leanings influence you over the raw truth.  So, I would
like to ask you something.

<p>
First, a little background.

<p>
In Nov &#8212; Dec of 2000, I was working as a high level Software QA Engineer on
the West Coast.  Actually, I was the head of a team on an important product
(tens of millions at stake) in an important division,  in a world class
semiconductor company.   In my role as such, there were times when I had to
be on the job late into the evening, for weeks on end.  Nov &#8212; Dec, 2000 was
once such time.  Usually, during these times, I spent much of my time
waiting for a new build from the development team.  I had a lot of free
time.

<p>
This period happened to be the time of the Famous Florida Recount in Gore v
Bush.  Because I had so much free time, I spent it all reading and following
every single court case and detail of the case.  I had a pile of papers on
my desk a foot high.  I printed everything.  Plus, I recorded all the major
cases:  Judge Saul's case, The Florida Supreme Court rulings, and the final
U.S. Supreme Court Rulings.  I knew every single detail in this chronology
(I wasn't just listening to news accounts, I was following the legal trail
documents):

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731003156/http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0884144.html" target="newwin79">
http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0884144.html</a>

<p>
So, whenever I would hear someone say &quot;Bush stole the 2000 election&quot; or that
&quot;the US Supreme Court 'picked' Bush&quot;, I always knew for myself, based on my
own personal observation and study that nothing of the kind ever happened.
What did happen is that Bush won, even though Gore and his team fought
desperately to find some way to &quot;harvest&quot; votes in those heavily Democrat
counties.  The final Supreme Court Case made perfect sense if you read
everything along the way.  They simply said that, &quot;The Court contends that
the recount was not treating all ballots equally, and was thus a violation
of the Constitution's equal protection and due process guarantees.&quot; and &quot;The
Supreme Court of Florida would be required to set up new voting standards
and carry them out in a recount.&quot;  and  if &quot;manual recounts in counties with
large numbers of undervotes are to be recounted, using new standards, that
the whole state had to be recounted using those standards&quot; and the
conclusion of others was that  &quot;Since the Court makes its ruling just hours
before the deadline, it in effect ensures that it is too late for a
recount.&quot;

<p>
This lead to the inevitable conclusion in the Gore camp, that Bush won, and
it was over.  There was no time left, so in spite of the fact that they
didn't like it, they accepted it.  They had no choice.

<p>
Now my question:

<p>
In your essay &quot;How to Deprogram Your Own Mind&quot; you say:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Powerful stock-holders similarly muzzled the New York Times, and kept it
from reporting how Gov. Jeb Bush rigged the Presidential election in Florida
in 2000, so such problems are everywhere. (Jeb did it by removing about
60,000 honest black people from the voter registration lists, claiming that
they were &quot;felons&quot;.)&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ok, I will concede to you that if that is true, that is a damning indictment
on Bush's victory.  I've never heard that before.  Those 60,000 votes would
surely have sealed the deal for Gore.  But how do you know that?  Is there
really concrete proof of that?  Could that be proven in a court of law?

<p>
I know this isn't the main purpose or subject of your site, so I would
certainly understand if you don't want to open this door in your public
forum.  Also, since it really is off topic, I wouldn't be terribly upset if
you just ignore it.  I just happened to be fascinated by that fact, and this
question:  Is it really known to some that Jeb Bush did this?  That's
mind-boggling to me.

<p>
Thanks for taking the time to read this,

<p>
R.J.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Richard,
<p>
Thank you for a good question. There is a lot of evidence that can be proven in
a court of law, but there is very little political will to do so.
No &quot;political capitol&quot;, you know. &quot;It's over.&quot;
 Congress passed a law
that will supposedly keep it from happening again, and then went on to other
worries. But improper purges happened again in several states in the 2004 election.

<p>
Note that many publications covered the story later, like in the following
year, after the election had already been stolen, and GWB was sworn in.
Greg Palast, an American who corresponds for the BBC, said that he was able to get his
stories of investigations of corruption in the Florida election published in London during
the controversy,
but not in the USA. The article by Palast below was published in February 2001.
Neither the New York Times nor the Washington Post covered the story during the
election. Nor did any other major US newspaper. Nor did any TV network news.
It was like a blackout.
<p>
The New York Times finally published an article telling the story in July 2004.
The Washington Post got around to it in May 2001.
<p>
The <b>Salon</b> article below (second item) is the only one I've found that was published while
the election and vote count and Supreme Court controversy was going on.

He also rips apart Gore's lawyer, and calls the guy incompetent.

Now about

that owners of the New York Times kept it from covering the voter purge
story during the election</a>,
 how I wish I had put a footnote in there.
I don't remember at the moment where I got that. I shall have to investigate.

<p>
Oh, and if you want a current hot issue, I just ran into articles that revealed that
Tamiflu is a fraud. It seems that Roche (a Swiss pharmaceutical company) faked the
test data that shows that Tamiflu works on the flu. Complete fraud. The marketing and PR
guys at Roche wrote the supposedly &quot;scientific&quot; results.
Conveniently, most all of the test results that would show whether Tamiflu really works
 are &quot;lost&quot;.
<p>
The U.S. government bought one and a half billion dollars worth of Tamiflu.
By the way, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is a major stockholder in the Tamiflu patent.

Hi A.Orange,

<p>
Thanks for all the info and the links on Florida's Gore v Bush battle.
There's quite a lot to digest there, but I do see where you're coming from.
I'm not so sure this rises to the level of something that would be provable
in a court of law, but the &quot;weight of the evidence&quot;, at least as far of this
collection of articles go, does bend in your favor.

<p>
By the way, I found a reference to 50,000 to 100,000 possibly
disenfranchised ex-felons (people who supposedly had their rights restored
in other states, and moved to Florida) here:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731003156/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20010205/palast" target="newwin22">
http://www.thenation.com/doc/20010205/palast</a>

<p>
There's just one problem, though.  A lot of the sources you used are
decidedly left leaning (doesn't rule out all of them, though), so I have to
take some of it with a &quot;what else would they say&quot; grain of salt.  But this
one from The Nation, would be way at the bottom of the list of those I might
give credence to.  They would have to prove it to me in a court of law
before I would believe them.  And even then, I still wouldn't believe them,
but I would concede (like a good American sport) that I lost.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I know that some of them are left-leaning. The right-leaning media, on the
other hand, just don't cover the story at all. They want to forget
all about it.  So we are stuck with what we can get.
<p>
And some of them, like the New York Times and Washington Post,
wouldn't even publish the story when it could have hurt George W. Bush.
So I can't consider them left-leaning, in spite of the complaints of
some Tea Parties.
<p>
Some facts in the case are undeniable, like that the purges occurred,
and many innocent people were prevented from voting. And instructing
the data company to purge people whose names were an 80% match to
a felon is at least incompetent, if not blatantly illegal.
<p>
Then the big legal question is whether the whole thing was a deliberate
scheme to disenfranchise certain groups of voters, or just incompetence.
It is more than suspicious when huge numbers of blacks (who were voting
for Gore) got purged, but large numbers of Latinos (who were voting
for Bush) did not get purged. The NAACP won a lawsuit on this issue,
but because they settled the case, the results were sealed and we can't
read the terms of the settlement.
</font>
<p>
Regarding Vincent Bugliosi, yes I'm very familiar with him and his work, but
I don't know if I'd trust him as far as I can throw him.  I saw him on TV on
numerous occasions talking about this subject, and my wife and I had a very
strong sense that he was full of crap, and that he had some hidden agenda.
As always though, I could be wrong.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Personally, I cannot vouch for him one way or the other either, but I
found his legal arguments in that book convincing, and troubling.
</font>
<p>
I'm not the least bit surprised about the Tamiflu stuff.  I've been saying
for years that history is going to look back on this era and proclaim the
Pharmaceutical Industry mass murderers, and some of the most evil people in
our nation's, and the world's history.  I'm firmly convinced that had my
brother merely talked to someone like Peter Breggin M.D. or some other
&quot;talking psychiatrist&quot;, instead of taking his &quot;meds&quot; (i.e., crap) over the
course of his lifetime that he would still be alive today.  There are
thousands of stories that back that statement at:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731003156/http://www.drugawareness.org/" target="newwin21">
http://www.drugawareness.org/</a>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry to hear about your brother. And yes, I also have to consider
the pharmaceutical industry as corrupt, and occasionally very evil.
There is just such a long history of faked tests of medicines,
 suppressed and hidden results (when the results were negative),
 and illegally pushing drugs on inappropriate
patients (like children for whom the drugs have not been approved).

<p>
Still, I'm not anti-medications, just anti-corruption.
<p>
Personally, I believe in &quot;whatever works&quot;.  If herbal cures work,
great. Or acupuncture or yoga or whathaveyou. Or psychotherapy. Or
chemically-manufactured pharmaceutical drugs.
Whatever works.
<p>
But of course we need valid unbiased tests to determine what really
works.  Faked tests are unacceptable, and illegal, and grossly immoral.
People who fake medical tests deserve a special place in Hell.

Thanks again.  Take care and have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year,

Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,<br>
Where we together weathered many a storm,<br>
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.<br>

<p>
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,<br>
Our words were told, our songs were sung,<br>
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied<br>
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.<br>

<p>
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,<br>
We never thought we could ever get old.<br>
We thought we could sit forever in fun<br>
But our chances really was a million to one.<br>

<p>
As easy it was to tell black from white,<br>
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.<br>
And our choices were few and the thought never hit<br>
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.<br>

<p>
How many a year has passed and gone,<br>
And many a gamble has been lost and won,<br>
And many a road taken by many a friend,<br>
And each one I've never seen again.<br>

<p>
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,<br>
That we could sit simply in that room again.<br>
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,<br>
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.<br>

Hello Orange,
<p>
 
I still check out your site from time to time (I've written you before)  I
enjoy reading the new letters postings.  I saw this video on the drinking
habits of monkeys on this one island and thought you might find the
parallels between &quot;us and them&quot; interesting:

Hi Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the link.
<p>
Wow. Now that is interesting. That's the most blatant example
that I've seen of alcoholic animals.  And I think it does give
a glimpse into human nature. The parallels are obvious and
striking.
<p>
What is particularly revealing is the fact that the monkey
population has
the same percentages of alcoholics and tea-totalers as humans do.
That points to a genetic factor, as there is no way to argue that
those monkeys and humans have the same environments, society, or childhood
upbringing.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;Matt T.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: The Twelve Biggest Secrets...<br>

<p>
Some people just don't get it. (The A.A. Program) They are just far too intelligent
to be helped. There are those unfortunates. They seemed to have been born that way.
The A.A. program only works if you want it to. It works for me. The quality of my
life in the past year of the A.A. program has been far better than all the preceding
50 years before it. Am I just being fooled by the program? If so, I will continue to
live this dream, for it is far better than anything I have ever known before it! I'd
rather live in the dream than die in the nightmare. Living life happy, joyous, and
free. With a very real and true honesty, openness, and willingness to do so. I found
through the A.A. program that alcohol wasn't my problem, living life was my problem
and I drank alcohol to avoid life. I don't have to drink today. I choose not to
drink today and that is a miracle today!

<p>
It's amazing to me when I come across someone who proposes an intelligent argument
as to why the program does not work how far they actually went in the program to
form the opinions and manipulate the numbers that they do for their arguments. And
the very un-ingenious ploy of using one of A.A.'s so called 'own members' to argue
their point.

<p>
Step 2: &quot;Came to believe a power greater than myself could restore me to sanity.&quot; I
was never insane. When I drank I did crazy and insane things as a result of drinking
alcohol. The insanity of the disease is in believing no matter how far down I have
gone in my life as a result of drinking alcohol; that I can continue to drink with
false impunity! Doing the same things over and over and over again, expecting
different results every time. That is the insanity talked about in step 2, pure and
simple. If I place my hand on a hot stove and burn it, do I continue to do so
expecting different results other than my hand being burned every time? That is the
insanity!

<p>
The scoffers can scoff, the whiners can whine, the complainers can complain all they
want to about the program. If they hang around long enough in the program they too
just might find the honesty, openness, and willingness to really get it.

<p>
I too was once a scoffer of the A.A. program for many, many years. I just couldn't
get it. Come to find out that it was so, so simple. I really had to want it before I
could really get it.

<p>
I've been to more rehabs and detox centers than I can count or care to remember and
none of them worked as well as the A.A. program. The only requirement of A.A. is an
honest desire to quit drinking. NOT...&quot;what type of insurance do you have and if you
don't have any, we can't help you!&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Matt,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Well, starting at the top, stupidity (lack of intelligence)
 is not an asset in quitting bad
habits. Period.  I should actually add that item
&#8212;
<font color="black">
&quot;some people are too intelligent&quot;</font>
 &#8212;
 to the list of 
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="newwin21">A.A.'s Biggest Lies</a>, because it is an often-repeated slogan, but
it is quite untrue.

<p>
You say,
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;The A.A. program only works if you want it to.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;The Program&quot; does not work at all. People quit drinking when
 they really want to quit; otherwise, they don't.
<p>
It is good that you quit drinking, and I'm glad that you are feeling good.
You did that, not any program.
Congratulations on your sobriety.
I'm really happy to hear that you are &quot;Living life happy, joyous, and free.&quot;
It is so much easier to feel good when you aren't poisoning yourself with
alcohol, isn't it?

<p>
This is garbled:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;It's amazing to me when I come across someone who proposes an intelligent argument

the very un-ingenious ploy of using one of A.A.'s so called 'own members' to argue
their point.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The meaning is unclear. I can only guess that you don't like statistical
analyses of A.A. that reveal the dropout rate and the failure rate.
And quoting ex-members who describe their experiences in A.A. is totally valid.

<p>
Then you wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results</i>
is only one of the &quot;insanities&quot; that Bill Wilson wrote about in
 the <i>Big Book</i>.
  How about the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#milk_whiskey" target="newwin32">
&quot;whiskey and milk&quot; drinker</a> who suffered from
&quot;strange mental blank spots&quot;?
How about the people who were supposedly unable to resist the first drink,
no matter what kind of a &quot;defense they put up&quot;?

<p>
Sponsors often use slogans like
<font color="black">
 <i>&quot;Your best thinking got you here&quot;</i>
</font>
 to
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="newwin47">tell
newcomers that they are insane and can't think right</a>.
 There is much more to the &quot;insanity&quot; of
Step 2 than you are admitting.
The &quot;insanity&quot; in Step 2 is why the newcomer is supposed to
 &quot;surrender&quot; his mind, his will, and his life in Step 3.
<p>
Then you wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You want to be honest and open? Oh good, very good. Please honestly and
openly answer this question:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">here</a>.)

<p>
RE:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;The only requirement of A.A. is an

</font>

<p>
No, actually, there is at least one more requirement that you have already
listed: You must dump your intelligence into the trash can and become
a stupid believer.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	A.A. and The Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Hi there Orange. I read with some interest as well as some irritation your
entire blog. While there are many problems with AA and some people who DO treat
it as a sort of cult, there are a vast and silent number of folks who actually
get good from it. It is not some evil empire created by a Hitler worshiping
maniac. While many of your premises seem well reasoned, you roam off into speculation and fantasy on many points.

<p>
In November, 2009 I passed 23 years clean, sober and tobacco free. Yes I quit
cocaine, alcohol and cigarettes all at once. Yes it was hell on earth. Instead
of relying on a single program such as AA to fix me up I lucked upon a (now
defunct) Drug treatment program called Coke Enders which took a holistic
approach to drug and alcohol addiction. The actual inpatient portion of the
program was one week. However the outpatient portion of the program was
massive.  It required that I attend AA meetings of one sort or another 7 days a
week for the first Year. I also had to change my diet, do regular exercise
including weight lifting and aerobics, do individual and group therapy every
single week for 5 years and actively worked out all my problems which had
landed me in addcition in the first place. Of the 21 people in my group, 12 of
us are clean and sober to this day. Guess that holistic approach works :&gt;)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Martin,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety.
</font>
<p>
Around the 5 year mark, I suddenly quit even thinking about drinking, drug use
and smoking and have never looked back and never will....and yes I will say
never. :&gt;) I haven't been to an AA meeting in about 18 years now but still
look back on my days at the meetings fondly. I made many close friends there
who supported me through the first very rough years. I DID receive the
unconditional love and friendship at my meetings that they talk about. My
sponsor was a very decent and compassionate man and a good friend as well. He
later went back to school and got his phd in psychiatry and works with addicts
to this day.  There is no simple way to quit and stay sober. Nothing
simplistic like Nancy Reagan's &quot;Just Say No&quot;.  Unless you actively work on
resolving the issues in your life which drove you to addiction you will never
rid yourself of the possibility of relapse. You will always be what the folks
in AA term a &quot;Dry Drunk&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Are you assuming that people who do not go to A.A. do not also work on
their &quot;other issues&quot;?
The people that I know do a lot of work.
</font>
<p>
Your use of statistics on more people dying in AA than out of it are pure
fabrication. Simply put ...HUGE numbers of alcoholics die every single day out
of AA but aren't reported in statistics because they die from a variety of
liver, kidney , heart and other ailments caused by alcoholism. These folks
aren't counted as dead alcoholics ...because they NEVER admitted to themselves
much less anyone else that they were Alcoholics in the first place.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Whoa! Hold on right there. I don't believe that I ever said anything like
that more people die of alcoholism in A.A. than outside of A.A. I wouldn't
make such a statement for the reasons that you just listed.
<p>
In fact,
<a href="orange-letters153.html#masked" target="newwin48">I just recently,
 in another letter</a>,
 explained why a fellow was seeing
so few deaths from alcoholism &#8212; telling him that the deaths were masked by
things like lung cancer or heart attacks.

<p>
Now I have said:
<ol>
<li> More people recover from alcohol abuse outside of A.A. than in A.A.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin52">
 A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<li> A.A. also raises the rates of

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin53">
binge drinking</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin54">
 rearrests</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin55">
the cost of hospitalization</a>.
<li> A.A. does not raise the sobriety rate in alcoholics.
<li> Slightly over half of all alcoholics
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="newwin50">
 recover without treatment or
a &quot;support group&quot;</a>.
</ol>

</font>
<p>
<p>
 The folks
that come into AA have admitted that they are alcoholics.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but that isn't necessarily true either.
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="newwin49">Lots of people are coerced
into A.A. meetings</a>
 by everything from the judge at a traffic court to a treatment
program to family and employers. Many of those coerced people are not
admitting anything.
</font>
<p>
 Many of the people
who come to AA are on their last legs and AA is a hail mary pass to try and
save their lives. Some are just too far gone and die anyway due to too many
years on the bottle.
<p>
<font color="blue">
So some people do choose to quit drinking and save their own lives, and some
don't. It's been that way since the Egyptians invented beer 5000 years
ago.  That doesn't have anything to do with Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>
 I was one of those that barely lived long enough to get
sober. In my first week of inpatient treatment, the doctor on staff was gravely
concerned that I would die at the  program. I was 6 feet tall and weighed 110
pounds to give you a vague idea of my condition. Saying someone died because
they were in AA is like saying someone died because they were a Republican or
an Eagle scout. Those folks that die while in AA didn't die as a result of
trying to get sober in AA they died because they had pushed their bodies beyond
the limit. Far more undiagnosed alcoholics die from addiction than have ever
died while trying to get sober in AA.  Also, just curious ...if I die tomorrow
with 23 years sobriety...does that make me one more of the people who died in
AA? :&gt;)

<p>
<font color="blue">
When I say that people have died because of A.A., I am talking about things
like people being told not to take their doctor-prescribed medications,
and then dying from untreated medical ailments, or committing suicide.
 Although a good case can be made that
more people die because they are driven to relapse by A.A.
Teaching people that they are powerless over alcohol,
and have &quot;no defense&quot; against the first drink is guaranteed to cause
big troubles.
</font>
<p>
Also saying more people quit alcoholism out of AA than in it is just pure
rampant speculation. There are NO statistics whatsoever on how many alcoholics
just quit on their own.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="newwin50">
The Harvard Medical School disagrees with you</a>. Why don't you
write to them and tell them that
they don't know what they are talking about?
</font>
<p>
 Primarily because alcoholics rarely if ever think of
themselves as alcoholics and even if they do, they never just voluntarily tell
someone collecting statistics that they are.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is lame. You think that the only way to collect statistics about
alcoholics is to ask them if they are alcoholics?
</font>
<p>
 Part of the problem of alcoholism
is the art of denial to yourself that you have a problem in the first place.
Ask any stranger that drinks in a bar if they are an alcoholic and they will
tell you no. Flat no. They always have a friend that drinks more than they do
and they don't think their friend is an alcoholic.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is a lame argument. Researchers collect statistics about alcohol
abuse from everything from hospital records to traffic fatalities to court
records to research studies of drinking patterns.
</font>
<p>
 Admittedly there are some
folks that just quit, but to make a claim that they comprimise the majority of
clean and sober people is pure sophistry and wishful thinking. The great
majority of us who have long term sobriety put a LOT of effort and time into
it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And that is a subtle cultish game of one-upmanship. So your sobriety is better than
other people's sobriety because you work at it more?
<p>
You cannot grade sobriety like levels of spirituality. Sobriety is very simple:
either you consume alcohol, or you don't.
</font>
<p>
Admittedly , there are lots of folks in AA who spout Cliches and maxims at any
given opportunity and look down their 5 year sobriety noses at one year sobriety
people. There are AA tyrants and AA assholes and AA compulsive obsessives and
any other term you can come up with ...just like there are in regular society
and in about the same ratio give or take an asshole or two. :&gt;)

 There are far
more people in AA who are caring, kind, compassionate and supportive at least in
my experience. I am sorry if your own experience of the program so embittered
you that you felt compelled to make it your life's work  to try and  blacken
every aspect of a program that has helped so many folks.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is minimalization and denial. There is no evidence that A.A. has
&quot;helped so many&quot;. The evidence is that it has harmed more than it has helped.
A.A. doesn't get people sober,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin52">
 it doesn't raise the sobriety rate,
 it just raises the death rate</a>. That isn't helping people.

reply. I however read your entire blog with an open mind and willingly
acknowledge that you do have some points and that blindly following ANY
principles without question is a dangerous thing. Most of us in AA however
recognized that the Big book is no more pure unmitigated truth than the Holy
Bible is. Knowing that however does not make AA useless nor does knowing that
about the Bible make me any less of a Christian. I  am not willing to toss out
the baby with the bathwater. There is a lot of Good in AA as well.

Well, if you have read my &quot;entire blog&quot; (that isn't a blog), then what are
you going to do to fix the problems of the rapists in
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin51">
 the Midtown Group and the Pacific Group</a>, while you are being so spiritual?
<p>
What are you doing to stop sponsors from killing their sponsees by telling
them not to take their medications?
<p>
It's easy to claim to be spiritual when you don't have to actually do anything
to stop wrong-doing in your organization.

<p>
As part of my changed approach to life, I don't carry anger with me anymore. If
something upsets me I address it immediately and then I am done with it. Having
written my letter to you, I am done with the things that upset me about your
blog. I have for years had my long sought peace and happiness with life . I
hope you have as well.

Okay, so you have learned some anger management. Good.

<p>
Agent Orange Cult,

<p>
What AA has going for them is a great system of distribution, cant you hijack that
and replace the BS with stuff that works from e.g.
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin38">letter 133</a>?

<p>
Do you use socialization with other sober persons as part of your staying sober
plan? Are you indeed sober still or using in moderation (you do encourage asking
questions)?

<p>
Best regards, Thor F. H.

<font color="blue">
Hello Thor,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.  I don't think that I need to found an organization,
because there are already several good ones around. I think it will work
better if we just support and grow them.
<a href="orange-letters153.html#alt_list" target="newwin21">Here is the list</a>.
They really do know just about
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin38">everything that I know</a>.

<p>
Over the years, I have really thought about starting up a
 &quot;good sobriety cult&quot; that
would harness the cultish energy and <i>esprit de corps</i> of A.A. or N.A.,
and encourage people to stay clean and sober. But the problem with cults
seems to be inherent in the structure and style of the group. Cults get weird,
they become corrupt, they go bad. That just seems to happen so often.
Both
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="newwin60">Synanon</a>
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones" target="newwin61">The People's Temple</a>
 were at one time considered great
organizations, God-sends that got many people off of drugs and alcohol. But
the cultish structure won out and the leaders went crazy and took their
organizations with them.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin59">That is happening
in A.A. now, too</a>. I mean, they were always cultish,
but now it's getting worse, with officially sanctioned sexual exploitation
and a strong heirarchical power structure leading up to the new gurus, and
empire-building by taking over neighboring groups.

<p>
Personally, I don't use socialization with other people to stay sober.
I haven't been to any kind of sobriety meeting in four or five years, now.
 If
anything, I use socialization with geese, especially the cute little goslings,
as my sobriety group.
But the truth is, I really stay sober just by not drinking alcohol.
I remember what it did to me, and I don't want to go back to that kind
of suffering again, so I am doing other things with my life now.

<p>
You may ask about my drinking. It's quite alright, and I know that some
people are very curious about how well I am doing.
The answer is simple: I totally abstain from alcohol and tobacco &#8212; not
a single sip or puff in 9 years. (I also don't do any other drugs,
either, other
than kick-ass Espresso coffee.) I have to do it that way because I
am one of those people who cannot moderate on either alcohol or
tobacco. Once I start down that slippery slope, there are no limits.
 It's all or nothing. It's like instant readdiction.
So I choose to have none of that pain and suffering in my life
any more, and I'm quite happy with the
decision, and the resulting lifestyle.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;R. J.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Then and Now<br>

<p>
Hi Agent,

<p>
I want to tell you about an observation I made regarding the difference
between the 30 day rehab I did in '85 vs. the one I did this year, and ask
you if you have a generalization that explains it.  They were both 12 Step
A.A. based, but there are some significant differences.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
1985:   None of the patients were on saboxone (or mouthwash, for that
matter, since it would result in expulsion from the program).

<p>
<li>
2009:   Many of the patients brought their saboxone prescriptions with them,
and were on it throughout their stay.  This caused much destabilization with
other patients who were not on drugs (obviously, since we were in rehab).
</ul>

<p>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
1985:   During my entire stay, of all the people I met, the entire revolving
25 people or so (total of maybe 50 people), only a couple of them (certainly
no more than 5) were there because the courts ordered them to be there.  The
vast majority were there for the same types of reasons I was there:
couldn't function on their jobs, seeing ants crawling on their arms, tried
to drive their car into a lake, were dying from heroin, liver disease, etc.

<p>
<li>
2009:   During my stay, of all the revolving 35-40 people or so (total of
maybe 80 people), I would be hard-pressed to come up with 5 or so who
weren't there because they were court ordered.  The exact opposite of the
case in '85.  This was extremely frustrating to the people who were there to
change their lives around.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
1985:   Counselors were not afraid to &quot;confront&quot; a patient at a group
meeting, if they thought the patient was being dishonest, evasive, etc.
Usually, the confrontation was done in a firm but kind voice.  On numerous
occasions, I saw patients who were somewhat shocked (or rocked) by the
comment.  I was one of them, when the head counselor said to me in my first
week, &quot;if you're so smart, why are you here?&quot;  She said it kindly, but
believe me, it had a profound impact on me, forcing me to shut up and listen
for a few days.

<p>
<li>
2009:   There was nothing that could remotely have been considered
confrontational.  Not in the open setting of a group meeting, anyway.  Maybe
in the office if they were kicking someone out, but that's not what I'm
talking about.  One counselor even told me in private that their hands were
tied; they couldn't be confrontational even if they wanted to.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
1985:   I was given the assignment to read &quot;Reality Therapy&quot; by William
Glasser, which taught you exactly what the title implies, that it's really
all about the reality of daily living, and how to get on with it, how to
solve life's daily problems.  As a counseling method, Reality Therapy &quot;is a
problem solving method that works well with people who are experiencing
problems they want help solving, as well as those who are having problems
and appear to not want any assistance. Reality Therapy also provides an
excellent model for helping individuals solve their own problems objectively
and serves as the ideal questioning series during coaching sessions&quot;.
(quote: from Reality Therapy Central) {Orange: not intended as an
endorsement or advertisement, but just to make my point in retelling my
story, and as a recognition that they weren't my words}

<p>
<a name="Gorski"> </a>
<li>
2009:   I saw no sign whatsoever of any such counseling, individual or
otherwise.  Everything I saw was &quot;touchy feely&quot;, or confined to assignments
from the book on how to spot and prevent relapses:  &quot;Staying Sober&quot; by
Gorski.  Or questions that could be answered &quot;off the cuff&quot; without any
reading or studying.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
1985:   If someone was &quot;kicked out&quot; of the program, there was an immediate
&quot;debriefing&quot; by the staff to the patients explaining, and defusing the bad
feelings that came of it.

<p>
<li>
2009:   If someone was &quot;kicked out&quot; of the program, he simply disappeared
with no word.  One day he was there at the meetings, next day he was gone.
Any questions were met with stonewalling or catch phrases like, &quot;we're here
to do OUR programs&quot;, resulting in many bad feelings, much &quot;f___ this&quot; and
&quot;f___ that&quot; for a day or so.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
I'm sure I could think of more, but you get the idea.  What do you make of
this?  Is there anything you can think of that summarizes these differences
briefly?

<p>
R.J.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello R.J.,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and a good question. Just offhand,
I don't know the answers there. Perhaps the readers have some ideas.

<p>
It is possible that the two different treatment centers were just
being run by different people in very different ways, or it is possible
that you are seeing a trend towards mindless fluff.

<p>
The fact that you saw so many court-ordered people recently is
certainly problematic. There are a bunch of people who make big
money from all of those coerced patients, and they do everything
they can to sell the myth of successful treatment, and to encourage
the courts to send more victims their way.
 The slogan &quot;Treatment Works!&quot; is such a scam.

<p>
About the treatment center using a Terence Gorski book as their
manual:
Personally, I wouldn't bet my sobriety on a book by Gorski.
I've commented on his writings several times:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Gorski1" target="newwin27">
&quot;Ego&quot; is supposedly the cause of addiction</a>
<li> <a href="orange-bibliography.html#TGorski1" target="newwin28">
Gorski's book, <i>Understanding the Twelve Steps</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-bibliography.html#TGorski2" target="newwin29">
Gorski's book, <i>Passages Through Recovery; An action Plan for Preventing Relapse</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters36.html#Gorski1" target="newwin26">
Citing Gorski to support quackery and pseudo-science</a>
</ol>

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.
