Orange,

I do believe your website and all of the information and letters saved my life from
the cult. When my gut instinct screamed at me to, &quot;Get Out!&quot; of AA, I was really
sick and getting sicker with every meeting. I will never forget how sick AA made me,
or how I felt after leaving the chaos &amp; confusion. AA does create the chaos &amp; there
is no harmony in their lies.
<p>
When I found your website,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html">the <i>Propaganda &amp; Debating Techniques</i></a>
helped me to start deprogramming. They described all the insanity that
the fellowship was doing to mess with my sanity. I experienced big-time love-bombing
turned into abuse in the form of reward or withholding. Since I wasn't putting on a
good enough &quot;act as if; fake it BS&quot; the fellowship turned zombie-abusive towards me.
I can remember being so sick feeling &amp; trying to communicate with the
self-proclaimed winners &amp; they would have snide one-liners that didn't even apply to
what I was talking about. It drove me nuts. It hurt at first to realize I had wasted
so much time &amp; resources in a cult, it was hurtful to realize that &quot;none&quot; of those
cult members ever had intentions of forming healthy relationships with each other or
myself.
<p>
The deprogramming was the hardest. I am still going through the down-side to
recovery, because a person can't just open up all their wounds and then go merrily
skipping off into a sunset. I had to find &quot;real facts, meaning, &amp; solutions&quot; to all
the issues AA opened up for me and AA didn't have even one reality-based solution
for. There are so many more intelligent, advanced books on subjects related to
healing than the pathetic solutions of the Big Book. I tried many times to use the
steps to solve my problems and the results were disastrous every single time. I hope
you keep your website up, because it is a fine collection of anti-AA material &amp;
there are people out there who need to know that if they are suffering in AA it is
not their imagination.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I come from a real alcoholic family with real alcoholic tendencies myself and there
is not one single person in this entire world that could convince me AA has an
honest, factual, realistic solution to anything related to the subject. Before I
ever attended AA, I had created this method of coping with life that was similar to
what AA tries to implies, &amp; so at first I thought it would be really cool to meet
other people who were trying to live simple &amp; honest sober. The truth is AA
destroyed my entire delusional state of living life accepting everything as having
some spiritual purpose (it is a mind trick into accepting or coping with things in
this world that are really unacceptable). AA changed my entire view of all the
experience and knowledge that I have &amp; left me seeing the world around me as one big
lie ... all the systems are created to keep a person so busy trying to make them
work when they don't that a person can easily get lost. I am not inspired to have a
life that is the reflection of the people around me.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Just imagine how many people over the last 70 years went insane working the AA
program, because there was no internet allowing people to find eachother &amp; speak up:
about AA's crimes against other people? To me AA's message, program, steps, and
fellowship are all abusive which is the most common dysfunction of addiction and
they breed it and keep it alive and well. I don't need any more tough-love in my
life. I have never met an alcoholic who wasn't belligerent and mean. I have met a
few alcoholics that were too drunk to be anything but either looking for a drink,
stumbling, or passed out ...

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I don't need any more &quot;fake love&quot; or &quot;fake, plastic, superficial, narcissistic,
abusive, dysfunctional, stupid crap&quot; in my life &amp; there is plenty of it in the rooms
of AA. Your website is &quot;real&quot; and gives everyone a chance to express their true
experience with the AA cult, and allows AA members to show the world how they really
are: illogical &amp; abusive. I do believe without a doubt the steps' intention is to be
used to exploit people (period). There is no good will in them. I remember my sponsor
telling me that my 5th step was going to do her more good than it would me (I
thought everything was weird then, &amp; your site allowed me to process the truth
through to why it is all 100% weird now!) ... Sponsors are nothing but communication
triangle break-downs; they are people with an incurable, deadly, insane disease and
they will give you freely their std of death if you let them. I don't want whatever
AA members think they have and I don't find their speaker tapes to be funny or
educational at all.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I have over one-year of deprogramming &amp; thanks to all the information on your
website &amp;
<a href="orange-links.html#Blamedenial">the work of Blamedenial</a>.
 I can see &amp; hear the AA message for what it is: a
cult. I am recovering from being completely destroyed by the stupidest solution ever
for problems associated with alcohol. When I cross the path of cult members who
&quot;love-bombed&quot; me for over a year or two or three &amp; now pretend they don't know me
(just like many people have said) it shows their true colors: you either accept the
entire cult program or you are out-casted ... I would rather be out-casted trying to
make a life in reality based on facts and honesty than to be a life-time member of
the most insane recovery cult ever developed. I don't think it is funny to hurt
people who are already suffering: AA is like pouring salt &amp; vinegar on people's open
wounds and then laughing at them. I can picture all those &quot;winners&quot; sitting around
their clubs until they become old-timers who can only repeat a false message of
nothing and believe themselves. I did not meet &quot;one&quot; single person in AA that I
would consider honestly recovered from anything related to addiction. Your website
helped to free my mind from all the AA lies &amp; it did save my life.

Orange,
<p>
I find the following information interesting! It seems that Bill's association with
famous people really was a joke on him to help create another institution for
keeping people slaves to the system. The famous system of non-profit and volunteering
to do the work for free or at below-living wages while a select group stays forever
wealthy from the stupidity of the masses. I am struggling with my children's
education and this explains why ... I remember in school being taught we have 5
senses. That isn't true, we have 6 and the 6th sense incorporates all the senses
that our system wants to deny people like their gut instinct or the right to think,
feel, or know the truth. The blind following the blind ... hope you find this as
interesting as I did. I had to read it a few times to let the totality of what these
people were trying to warn the future about. I already knew most of it, but
sometimes it takes courage to speak the truth, because it is easier to just be a
blind voiceless sheep with your ego beaten down into despair forever a slave to the
systems ... the bottom line of the spreadsheet doesn't add up.

<p>

Between 1896 and 1920, a small group of industrialists and financiers, together with
their private charitable foundations, subsidized university chairs, university
researchers, and school administrators, spent more money on forced schooling (i am
adding this: Indians were forced into horrible schools where they were abused under
these policies too) than the government itself did. Carnegie and Rockefeller, as
late as 1915, were spending more themselves. In this laissez-faire fashion a system
of modern schooling was constructed without public participation. The motives for
this are undoubtedly mixed, but it will be useful for you to hear a few excerpts
from the first mission statement of Rockefeller's General Education Board as they
occur in a document called Occasional Letter Number One (1906):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
In our dreams...people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands.
(brainwashing) The present educational conventions [intellectual and character
education] fade from our minds, and unhampered by tradition we work our own good
will upon a grateful and responsive folk. We shall not try to make these people or
any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or men of science. We
have not to raise up from among them authors, educators, poets or men of letters. We
shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians, nor lawyers,
doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have ample supply. The task
we set before ourselves is very simple... we will organize children... and teach them
to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an
imperfect way.

quotes worth considering about education:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;A government system of education in
Prussia is not inconsistent with the theory of Prussian society, for there all
wisdom is supposed to be lodged in the government. But the thing is wholly
inadmissible here . . . because, according to our theory, the people are supposed to
be wiser than the government. Here, the people do not look to the government for
light, for instruction, but the government looks to the people. The people give the
law to the government. To entrust, then, the government with the power of
determining the education which our children shall receive is entrusting our servant
with the power to be our master. This fundamental difference between the two
countries [United States and Prussia], we apprehend, has been overlooked by the
board of education and its supporters.&quot;

&quot;This subject [mass psychology] will make great strides when it is taken up by
scientists under a scientific dictatorship. Anaxagoras maintained that snow is
black, but no one believed him. The social psychologists of the future will have a
number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of
producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be
arrived at. First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much
can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses
set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion
that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity... It is for
future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it
costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it
would cost to make them believe it is dark grey. Although this science will be
diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace
will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique
has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a
generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies

Thanks again for the input.

You know, those quotes reminded me of something that Dr. Paul Diener
wrote about how, in the earliest days of A.A., the Alcoholics Anonymous organization and philosophy was
actually spread, promoted, and forced on drunks from above, by the
wealthy people like Rockefeller, and by the courts, rather than growing
as any kind of &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot; program:

Paul Diener believed that A.A. was just another way for the rich and powerful to subdue

I got sober, in AA, in 1981.  I found it to be  therapeutically very
effective to examine the bases of my morality, as the Big  Book recommends.  But,
like a lot of others, I increasingly found the  cultlike aspects of the AA
meetings to be such a complete waste of time that I  stopped hanging out with
AAers about 15 years ago (or  thereabouts).  So I am an not an AA apologist, but
I genuinely  object to your chronic misrepresentation of the program.  I list
some  examples:

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
1. You repeatedly refer to the moral inventory as a list of &quot;sins,&quot; as
though we're supposed to list our moral transgressions. The moral inventory is a
simple list of (a) things we are angry about, (b) things we fear, and (c) our
sex problems. I guess the idea is that if we face our resentments, fears,
and sex problems, then we gain insight into how the loss of inhibition with
drinking lets us do what we really want to do, but don't have the balls to do
sober. So, as I read the moral inventory, it was part of a plan to gain the
courage to do and say what we really want to, even when we're not drinking. I
found this to be very helpful and would recommend it to others. Maybe I was
unusually screwed up when I got to AA and people who are less screwed up can
work this stuff out for themselves. But your repeated portrayals of the
moral inventory as a kind of soul-cleansing confession of wrongdoing by a
supplicant to some kind of &quot;sin-scrubber&quot; really misses the point of doing this. I
gained self-knowledge through this activity &#8212; why would an honest guy like
you attack what seems to me to be a relatively healthy thing to do?

<p>
<font color="blue">
What Bill Wilson described as a &quot;moral inventory&quot; on page 65 of the <i>Big Book</i> is no
such thing. A list of angers, fears, and sex problems is an emotional inventory, or a
psychological inventory, but it most certainly is not a moral inventory.
A real moral inventory would have to start with things like, &quot;Who have you killed lately?
Do you help to exploit the poor and down-trodden, or do you work to liberate them from
their suffering? Work for war or peace?&quot; and so on.
<p>
I am all for introspection, but that isn't what Bill Wilson was teaching. His simple-minded
&quot;moral inventory&quot; was nothing more than a veiled put-down, implying that you are defective
for being angry or fearful, or sexually insecure.

2. You repeatedly rail against the dominating influence of sponsors &#8212; noting
how they take over the lives of the AA inititiates. You are spot on about
this, by the way.  I never had a sponsor, because absolutely nowhere in the
first 164 pages of the Big Book (the canonical doctrine, I guess) does the Big
Book actually recommend a sponsor for any purpose other than to introduce a
newcomer to a group.  As far as I could see from the Big Book, I did not  need a
sponsor to work the 12 Steps, and I had enough problems without having to
deal with another ex-drinker trying to advise me.  So, once a sponsor says,  &quot;Hi
folks, this is Ralph,&quot; then all sponsorship duties vis-a-vis Ralph have  been
duly completed.  This is not what you hear in meetings, but that's  what the
Big Book has to say about sponsors, so I wonder why you keep harping  about
this.  People in meetings tell you that you need a sponsor, but the  &quot;canonical
doctrine&quot; does not, so the truth is just more nuanced than you make  it out to
be.  (Incidentally, over the years, I have moved from a position  of
believing that getting a sponsor is merely a harmless diversion, to my  present view,
which is that AA sponsorship is positively dangerous, but  then it is not
really part of the 12-steps).

<p>
<font color="blue">
You should read Bill Wilson's second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
That's where he went off the deep end on sponsorship.  Sponsorship was hardly mentioned
in the first book, the &quot;Big Book&quot; <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, even though it was a regular
practice in A.A. because that's what the Oxford Group did, and A.A. was just another branch
of the Oxford Group (even after it split from the Oxford Group).  At that time, your sponsor was the
person who recruited you.
The sponsor was also usually the person to whom you made your surrender and your confession.
<p>
I think Wilson down-played and hid sponsorship in the <i>Big Book</i> because he was hiding the
similarities between the Oxford Group and Alcoholics Anonymous.  The founder of the Oxford Group,
Dr. Frank Buchman, was very unpopular for his praise of Adolf Hitler and support for the Nazis,
so Bill Wilson pretended that there was no connection between A.A. and the Oxford Group, and he
changed the language and terminology to remove resemblances between the two.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little. They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts &#8212; absolute purity, absolute
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently
too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
Here is a story from &quot;12X12&quot; where a sponsor teaches a newcomer to stop thinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;... all you really need is a truly open mind.
Just resign from the debating society and quit bothering yourself with
such deep questions as whether it was the hen or the egg that came first.
Again I say, all you need is the open mind.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The sponsor continues, &quot;Take, for example, my own case. I had a scientific schooling.
Naturally I respected, venerated, even worshiped science. As a matter of fact,
I still do &#8212; all except the worship part. Time after time, my instructors held
up to me the basic principle of all scientific progress: search and research, again
and again, always with the open mind. When I first looked at A.A. my reaction
was just like yours. This A.A. business, I thought, is totally unscientific.
This I can't swallow. I simply won't consider such nonsense.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Then I woke up. I had to admit that A.A. showed results, prodigious results. I
saw that my attitude regarding these had been anything but scientific.
It wasn't A.A. that had the closed mind, it was me. The minute I stopped
arguing, I could begin to see and feel. Right there, Step Two gently and
very gradually began to infiltrate my life. I can't say upon what occasion
or upon what day I came to believe in a Power greater than myself, but I certainly
have that belief now. To acquire it, I had only to stop fighting
and practice the rest of A.A.'s program as enthusiastically as I could.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 26-27.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That story obviously reeks of
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">mental surrender to the cult</a>.
Just stop thinking, just stop questioning, and wonderful things will happen, Bill says.
<p>
And the &quot;sponsor&quot; supposedly didn't find happiness until he
underwent a religious conversion and &quot;came to believe&quot; in
the Alcoholics Anonymous deity.
So much for the often-repeated A.A. statements that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything">you don't have to believe
anything</a>.
<p>
Here, Bill Wilson explains how the sponsor continues to guide the new member's thinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So how, exactly, can the willing person continue to turn his will and his life over
to the Higher Power? ... His lone courage and unaided will cannot do it. Surely he must now
depend on Somebody or Something else.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first that &quot;somebody&quot; is likely to be his closest A.A. friend. ...
Of course the sponsor points out that our friend's life is still unmanageable even
though he is sober, that after all, only a bare start on A.A.'s program has been made.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, pages 38-39.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

And here, Bill Wilson teaches that the newcomer should allow his sponsor and other A.A. oldtimers to
edit and correct his thinking as he lists his faults in Step 4, or hears the Voice of God in Step 11:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbo
ok">
If all our lives we had more or less fooled ourselves, how could we
now be so sure that we weren't still self-deceived?
How could we be certain we had made a true catalog of our
defects and had really admitted them, even to ourselves?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... what comes to us alone may be garbled by our
own rationalization and wishful thinking.
The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get
his direct comment and counsel on our situation, and there can
be no doubt in our minds what that advice is.
Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
How many times have we
heard well-intentioned people claim the guidance of God when it
was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken?
Lacking both practice and humility, they had deluded themselves
and were able to justify the most arrant nonsense
on the ground that this was what God had told them.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Surely then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>

3. You have made a lot of Bill Wilson's quote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;After the husband joins A.A., the wife may become  discontented, even highly
resentful that Alcoholics Anonymous has done the very  thing that all her
years of devotion had failed to do. Her husband may become so wrapped up in A.A.
and his new friends that he is inconsiderately away from home more than when
he drank. Seeing her unhappiness, he recommends A.A.'s Twelve Steps and
tries to teach her how to live.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

Instead of taking this as intended (as  a humorous example of what a
fanatical blowhard a new AAer is likely  to be), you interpret the quotation
literally.  This was clearly an example  of self-deprecation, yet you choose to
portray
this as Bill Wilson actually  sanctifying the &quot;teaching of wives&quot; or some
such.

Now, if you think that  Bill Wilson was something of a demagogue, a
megalomaniac, or just plain nutty,  then I would be disinclined to disagree with
you, but in this passage I  genuinely believe that any dispassionate reading
would force the interpretation  that Bill Wilson was simply noting the kinds of
excesses that can occur in the  initial rush of purposefulness that many new
AAers do experience, even to the  point of trying to &quot;teach [the wife] how to
live.&quot;  The  humor lies in the absurdity of the newly sober spouse preaching to
the person  who has probably kept the family together over some years, through
a series of  crises caused by the newly sober spouse, and Bill Wilson invoked
this  absurd image fully self-consciously.  If you are as honest as you  claim
to be, why do you repeatedly interpret this text so  literally?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I can see how you can read that passage that way, but self-deprecating humor was not Bill Wilson's strong
suit.
Maybe, if everything else that Wilson wrote about his wife was sane and tolerant, then maybe
Bill could have been poking some fun at himself.  But that wasn't the case.
Bill Wilson's treatment of his wife was downright vicious, as well as arrogant, condescending, and chauvinistic.
Bill actually wrote Lois's confession for
her, and printed on page 116 of the <i>Big Book</i> that she was afflicted with pride, self-pity, and vanity, and
that she was so silly that she thought she was too good to need God. Remember that Bill Wilson
wrote this, while pretending to be his wife Lois:
<a name="we_wives"> </a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We wives found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted with pride,
self-pity, vanity and all the things which go to make up the self-centered
person; and we were not above selfishness or dishonesty. As our husbands
began to apply spiritual principles in their lives, we began to see the
desirability of doing so too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first, some of us did not believe we needed this help.
We thought, on the whole, we were pretty good women, capable of being
nicer if our husbands stopped drinking. But it was a silly idea that we
were too good to need God.
Now we try to put spiritual principles to work in every department
of our lives. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We urge you to try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to
your husband as the radically changed attitude toward him which
God will show you how to have. Go along with your husband if you
possibly can.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson wasn't joking even a little bit when he said that he taught the
Twelve Steps to his wife to teach her how to live.
Bill Wilson really was so arrogant and narcissistic that he insisted that he had all of the answers to life,
and his wife Lois knew nothing. (And that's why Bill thought she wasn't qualified
to write the &quot;To Wives&quot; chapter of the <i>Big Book</i>, so he did it for her.)
That is a hallmark of somebody who suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
<p>
You should read the entire &quot;To Wives&quot; chapter of the <i>Big Book</i> again.
Bill Wilson wasn't laughing when he wrote that chapter; he was spitting venom.
He was getting even with his wife Lois for screaming at him and calling him a drunken sot.
<br>
(Oh, and especially note the part where
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#dont_nag">Bill told the wives to shut up
and quit nagging, or else the husbands will go sleep with their mistresses</a>.
Bill wasn't joking about that either, and that threat wasn't any
self-deprecating humor.)

<font color="#9F0000">
[There is a continuation of this thread in another letter,
<a href="orange-letters116.html#teach_her">here</a>.]
</font>
<p>

I think your writing would be less tediously  hostile (and therefore more
accurate) if you distinguished the kinds of nutty  things that they say in
meetings from the kinds of things that are actually  recommended in the first 164
pages of the Big Book.  My point is simply  that it is far from accurate to
paint the AA 12-step program and the behavior of  contemporary AAers with the same
brush.

<p>

Let's compare and contrast:

<p>

People in Meetings (PM): Get a sponsor!<br>
Big Book (BB): No sponsor required to perform any of  the 12 steps.

<p>

PM: Don't have sex with any new people in the first  (30/60/90/365 days)!<br>
BB: Simply advises (a) for honesty in sexual (as  with other) relationships
and (b) against fully selfish motivations in sexual  relationships.

<p>

PM: Don't make any major changes in your life in the  first year!<br>
BB: Completely change your life for the better, the  sooner, the better.

<p>

PM: If you don't go to meetings, you will  probably relapse (as though going
to meetings actually keeps people  sober).<br>
BB: You can stay sober anywhere, at any time, no  matter how far you are from
other recovered alcoholics.

<p>

PM: (To newcomers): Wondering whether you are an  alcoholic?  Whatever you
do, don't drink!<br>
BB: (To newcomers): Wondering whether you are an  alcoholic?  Have a drink!
Heck, have a couple!  Then stop  drinking, abruptly.  If you cannot do this,
then you're probably an  alcoholic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What you are exposing there is the <i>Bait-and-Switch</i> nature of the Alcoholics Anonymous
message.
I wrote a whole web page on that.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html">Look here</a>.
And it isn't just the <i>Big Book</i> versus the sayings of contemporary A.A. members.
It's often Bill Wilson versus Bill Wilson.
You can quote him on both sides of many issues.
<p>
And you are bringing up another issue here: the question of what is &quot;the real A.A.&quot;?
<ul>
<li> Some people claim that the real A.A. is just what's in the <i>Big Book</i>.
<li> Others claim that it's only what is &quot;Council Approved&quot;.
<li> Others claim that it's only what is in &quot;<a href="orange-traditions">The Traditions</a>&quot;.
<li> Others claim that it's just what was done in the 'good old days'.
</ul>
I maintain that the whole mess is the real A.A. &#8212; whatever is 
said to the newcomers, or read to the newcomers, or done to the newcomers &#8212; that's the real A.A.
So is the crazy garbage that you hear in meetings, and the crazy instructions given to
newcomers &#8212; that's the real A.A. too.
And so is
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the 13th-Stepping and
sexual exploitation and abuse of newcomers</a>,
and the sponsors telling sponsees not to take their medications.
It's <i>all</i> &quot;the real A.A.&quot;.
</font>
<p>

Okay, I'm really finished, now.  Thanks for  reading, if you got this far.
<p>
Keep up the good work &#8212; the crap you hear in  meetings is really as ridiculous
as you make it out to be, but this stuff is  also inconsistent with the 12-step
program (which, I gather, you see as being  equally absurd).  Because working
those 12 steps really did change how  I made decisions in many areas of my
life, and because my life improved  beyond my wildest fantasies, I would
recommend them to anyone.  Hell,  you can always stop working them, if you want to.
The truth of the matter  is that you can work a 12-step program (if you want
to) without ever setting  foot into an AA meeting, and in my opinion, you would
be better off if you  did.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It's good that you chose to work on yourself and improve yourself, but I think you might
find that it wasn't really the practices of Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion that improved you.
 &#8212; That is, Buchman's cult practices for recruiting and indoctrinating new members that Bill Wilson copied
and made into the Twelve Steps.
Introspection and working to improve yourself is all fine and well, but practicing a cult religion
is generally very harmful.
<p>
<p>
I think that you are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">
<i>Confusing Causation with Coincidence</i></a> there, in assuming that the Twelve Steps fixed you.
<p>
Use a little logic: Ask yourself: If most of the people who have been going to
A.A. meetings and doing the Twelve Steps for years are
ridiculous and full of crap, then what are the Steps really doing for them, or to them?

Hi Jon,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. Now that's interesting. Sort of like the pot calling the kettle black.

<p>
In the overview,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160720132014/http://aacultwatch.co.uk/overview.aspx">http://aacultwatch.co.uk/overview.aspx</a>,<br>
the way in which they declare that &quot;good&quot; A.A. members must conform
to the &quot;proper&quot; beliefs is highly revealing &#8212; 

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

Whereas it is entirely legitimate for an individual AA member to hold
whatever views they want they are usually careful to ensure that others
are clear that they do not represent AA in their exposition.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you can believe anything you want, but you aren't really a genuine, 100% qualified
A.A. member, and you don't represent A.A., if you hold non-conforming views.
And they don't see that as cultish &#8212; or a contradiction to Bill Wilson's
declaration that &quot;no beliefs are required&quot;.

<p>
Likewise, they accuse &quot;the cultish A.A. branch&quot; of:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
It is part of the ethos of these groups that they carry a purer AA message...
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's funny, because I've heard regular vanilla A.A. making the same claim to having
a purer spirituality than either real medical doctors or other churches.
<p>
The rest of it, the description of how the rogue elements operate, is quite informative.
Thanks again for the link.

<p>
And have a good day.

From:  	&quot;G.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	NA Cult<br>

<p>

Hi Orange,

<p>

Thanks for the excellent website ; it confirmed everything I've thought
about NA for the last few months!

<p>

I'm going to bore you with yet another classic NA story. My girlfriend
came out of Rehab in August 2008 and 'needed' to attend these meetings
and 'work the steps'. I supported her and even attended two meetings as
her supporter and to see what it was all about. Keep in mind I don't use
drugs or alcohol &#8212; and never have ; know very little about them,
treatments, addictions or anything related &#8212; so I had no idea of what I
was stepping into. The meetings were ... different &#8212; but I still didn't
suspect much.

<p>

After 10 weeks (October 2008) I realized all she spoke about was NA ; she
was also never home and always at meetings, socials, events, coffee,
dinner, doing service, coming home late etc.  She missed my brothers
birthday, my staff Christmas party and small sections of my life and
what I was doing in it. I seemed to be the one complaining that I missed
her and not the other way around ; she had her NA friends and that was
all that was needed on her side. I brought up my worries and concerns &#8212;
and was promised things would change. The group swapped contact numbers
a few weeks prior so they could speak to each other when in need. This &#8212;
admittedly &#8212; irritated me slightly as I am a slightly jealous person.
However, all in the name of recovery. I even brought up the very real
fear of her leaving/cheating for an NA person. She denied this would
ever happen.

<p>

She told me about one particular guy (a known 13 stepper) that was
flirting, texting, asking for coffee, dates and get with her all the
time. She told me she rejected him plenty of times and even spoke to the
'senior' NA official about it. This problem &#8212; from what I understood &#8212;
had stopped. This was until early December 2008 when I found out they
had been texting and she'd attempted to cover up the texts! We had a
huge blow up over this and made up a few hours later. Surely now it
would end as she saw what it was doing to us? Not yet. A few days later
I found out they had chatted over the phone behind my back. We ended our
relationship that night and she moved out. NA ended the best thing in my
life.

<p>

It gets worse (in my eyes). She relapsed just over a week later after we
split up (December 2008) &#8212; and ended up in hospital for the night due to
the 4 day drug  binge, which almost cost her her life. I was the one
that picked up something was wrong ; I picked up the behavior and lies.
I informed her family that something was wrong with her and the
possibility of drugs again. I found out about the hospital incident and
I went to see if she was alright &#8212; before a single other person even
knew what was going on. When her NA friends found about her relapse and
swooped in &#8212; guess  who was at fault? Me! I was the reason she relapsed!
She shouldn't see me! I'm abusive! I'm a drunkard! I was disliked by all
at NA &#8212; yet where were NA when they were needed?

<p>

Once discharged, the 'senior' NA official told her not to see me, made
her stay at his place, drove her to work, took her money and basically
controlled her life for the following week. All in the name of recovery,
of course. Not only that, but I've since seen text and emails from him
trying his best to bed her and 'wanting her in his life'. She was his
'everything', according to these love messages. The texts and emails
made me ill &#8212; knowing that this was the 2nd guy I knew about trying (or
succeeding?) with 13th stepping in the past 2 weeks. What had actually
happened in the previous 4 months?

<p>

And one final blow is that out of the group, the majority have slept
with each other and 13th stepped. Fact. That's the norm. There are
people that are there for that exact reason. I could peg the percentage
of 13th steppers at over 50%. New comers to the group best watch out.

<p>

I thought that being in South Africa with a smallish group, things may
be different here and the NA politics may not be as prevalent &#8212; but it
is identical to what you describe. I find it difficult to understand
that an outsider can see what the group is like after 10 weeks &#8212; yet
some people attend (a very, very small percentage &#8212; as you point out)
 for 10 years and are oblivious. After doing some research, NA has
a habit of breaking up relationships &#8212; intimate, friends or family.

<p>

Please be wary of the sexual, social cult.

<p>

Thanks,

Hello, G,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It's good to warn others what might await them in &quot;the rooms&quot;.

<p>
Alas, being in South Africa is no defense. The 12-Step cult is a world-wide problem.
I am reminded of a previous letter from South Africa,
<a href="orange-letters11.html#seven_rehabs">here</a>, where a woman paid seven rehab facilities
to cure her drug addict friend, and got burned every time.
<p>
Your experiences are disturbingly similar to what another fellow described
<a href="orange-letters79.html#tc_nightmare">in a previous letter, here</a>.
He lost his girlfriend to a romantic relationship that started when she was in a rehab center.
When the correspondent asked how common these illicit rehab romances are, another correspondent
answered by explaining the mechanics of how the &quot;treatment program&quot; causes such relationships,
<a href="orange-letters79.html#romances2">here</a>.

<p>
Oh well, try to have a good day anyway.

<p>

I'm surprised at how strongly you find fault with AA. I have had an amazingly
good life in AA for 24 years.
I had just gotten out of a penitentiary prior to joining, due to a life of alcohol,
drugs and crime.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Glenn,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety and your good life.
<p>
I'm glad that you got your life together and quit the alcohol,
drugs and crime routine.  It's obvious that such a change improves your lifestyle
and makes you happier in the long run. And it sure makes it easier to stay out of prison.
The fact that you also coincidentally joined a non-drinking confession club
does not in any way mean that the club is due the credit for your new good life.
You made the positive changes in your life; A.A. didn't do them for you.
<p>
And if you are going to argue that somehow A.A. told you to improve
your life, or encouraged you to improve your life, well, so did the
warden and the parole officer, didn't they? So why not give all of the
credit for your good life to them?

<p>
You might want to read two previous letters that just came in from people who haven't had
such positive experiences with Steppism,

I just
finished reading your paper, &quot;What's Not Good about AA&quot;.  I am quite
impressed with some of your facts and opinions on the AA Program.  I am actually
doing a report on the different recovering for drug addiction and alcoholism.  I
went to a few &quot;open&quot; AA meetings and it appears there were some pretty happy people,
a few sad one and several in the middle.  I was quite impressed with the format and
how the people talked about the solution AA offered them to be free of drinking and
drugs.  I did not notice you citing any solutions for people that suffer from
addiction.  Can you point me in a direction in which I may find other solutions more
success than AA when it comes to recovery?
<p>
Thanks in advance for your help and consideration.

Hi Don,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
As I have said many times, you can find some very nice people at some A.A. meetings.
(Look
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Rescue_League">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters45.html#Rescue_League">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters52.html#Rescue_League">here</a>.)
<p>
Unfortunately, you can also find some real monsters there, too.
(<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">Look here</a>.)
Your luck, and your mileage, may vary.
<p>
At A.A. meetings, you will hear people talk about the solution that A.A. has offered them.
Unfortunately, it is a myth. It does
not actually work. (<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">Look here</a>.)
A few people get themselves sober, and keep themselves sober, and then they claim that A.A. is somehow doing it.
But the real A.A. success rate doesn't support such a claim.
The few sober people that you see in an A.A. meeting are merely
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">a tiny remnant</a>
from
the hundreds of people who came and left without being helped by A.A.'s &quot;solution&quot;.
Groups of alcoholics who go to A.A. meetings do not quit drinking in any greater numbers than the
other alcoholics who go it alone. 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School says so</a>.


<p>
We have often talked about what works better than A.A. There is a list
of such answers that I wrote in another letter,
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works">here</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi RS,
<p>
The answer is, to get the truth out, and to disseminate some information that will
hopefully be more helpful to addicts than old quackery has proven to be.
