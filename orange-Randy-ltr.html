ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS COMES OF AGE pg.100f
<p>

One day at Charlie Towns' hospital, Charlie beckoned me into his 
office for one of his Dutch-uncle talks. &quot;Look here, Bill,&quot; said 
he, &quot;I've got a hunch that this A.A. business of yours is someday 
going to fill Madison Square Garden. Now I am not a religious man and 
you must know that I was mighty skeptical of this business when it 
first came in here. Silkworth really scared me by his co-operation 
with you. But that is all changed. I believe in you people. Your 
methods are going to work.&quot; And he said, &quot;Look, Bill, don't you see 
you're getting the bad end of this deal? You are starving to death, 
and your wife is working at that store [She worked there until spring 
1939]. All around you, these drunks are getting well and making 
money, but you're giving this work full time, and still you're broke. 
It isn't fair.&quot;
<p>

Charlie fished in his desk and came up with an old financial 
statement. Handing it to me, he continued, &quot;This shows the kind of 
money this hospital used to make back in the 1930's. Thousands of 
dollars a month. It should be doing just as well now, and it would
&#8212; if only you'd help it. So why don't you move your work in here? I'll 
give you an office, a decent drawing account, and a very healthy 
slice of the profits. What I propose is perfectly ethical. You can 
become a lay therapist, and more successful than anybody in the 
business.&quot;

<p>
I was bowled over. There were a few twinges of conscience 
until I saw how really ethical Charlie's proposal was. There was 
nothing wrong whatever with becoming a lay therapist. I thought of 
Lois coming home exhausted from the department store each day, only 
to cook a supper for a houseful of drunks who were not paying board. 
I thought of the large sum of money I still owed my Wall Street 
creditors. I thought of some of my alcoholic friends who were making 
as much money as they ever did. Why shouldn't I do as well as they? 
Although I asked Charlie for a little time to consider it, my own 
mind was about made up. Going back to Brooklyn on the subway, I had a 
flash of seeming divine guidance. It was only a single sentence, but 
it was most convincing. In fact, it came right out of the Bible. A 
voice kept saying to me, &quot;The laborer is worthy of his hire.&quot; At home 
[182 Clinton Street, NYC] I found Lois cooking as usual, while three 
drunks looked hungrily on from the kitchen door. I drew her aside and 
told her the glorious news. She looked interested, but not as excited 
as I thought she should be.
<p>

It was meeting night. Although few of the alcoholics we boarded 
seemed to get sober, some others had. With their wives, they crowded 
into our downstairs parlor. At once I burst into the story of my 
opportunity. I never shall forget their impassive faces and the 
steady gazes they focused on me. With waning enthusiasm, my story 
trailed off to the end. There was a long silence.
<p>

Almost timidly, one of my friends began to speak. &quot;We know how hard 
up you are, Bill,&quot; he said. &quot;It bothers us a lot. We've often 
wondered what we might do about it. But I think I speak for everyone 
here when I say that what you now propose bothers us an awful lot 
more.&quot; The speaker's voice grew more confident. &quot;Don't you realize,&quot; 
he went on, &quot;that you can never become a professional? As generous as 
Charlie has been to us, don't you see that we can't tie this thing up 
with his hospital or any other? You tell us that Charlie's proposal 
is ethical. Sure, it's ethical. But what we've got won't run on 
ethics only; it has to be better. Sure, Charlie's idea is good, but 
it isn't good enough. This is a matter of life and death, Bill, and 
nothing but the very best will do.&quot; My friends looked at me 
challengingly as their spokesman continued. &quot;Bill, haven't you often 
said right here in this meeting that sometimes the good is the enemy 
of the best? Well, this is a plain case of it. You can't do this 
thing to us.&quot;
<p>

Thus spoke the group conscience. The group was right and I was wrong; 
the voice on the subway was not the voice of God. Here was the true 
voice welling up out of my friends. I listened and &#8212; thank God &#8212; I 
obeyed.

This little story is very spiritual. We should adhere to its lesson 
and distinguish the message from the messenger. There is reason to 
believe that the end of the story is fabricated and historically 
false. <b>Bill did not obey.</b>
<p>

We know from Chapter 1 in the Big Book that Bill was frequently a lay 
therapist at the Charles B. Towns Hospital. 
<p>

We know from the above story that Bill was offered money. 
<p>

We know from other sources that he campaigned for paid AA 
missionaries (with himself as the chief missionary). 
<p>

We know from the first Works Publishing Inc. financial report that 
Charles B. Towns gave $2,539.<br>

We know from Henrietta Seiberling about Bill's &quot;taking the money&quot; for 
himself privately.<br>

$7,989 (more than $100,000 in year 2000 dollars) was collected in 
advance for printing the book. But when it was to go to the printer in March,
1939, the $2,414.71 needed to pay Cornwall Press was not available, and &quot;all 
were broke&quot; and &quot;we had no money to pay the printer&quot;.
Guess where it went!<br>

<p>

There is a letter in the AAWS archives (earmarked &quot;For eyes only&quot;) from 
Bill to a friend in Texas asking him for money to buy Bill a new car. 
Bill goes on saying something to the extent &quot;If this damn AA can't 
pay me well enough I'll have to look for another BUSINESS TO FEED MY 
NEEDS.&quot; Such an attitude speaks for itself.
<p>

A well known, trustworthy AA archivist had access many years ago and 
held this letter in hand, but was unable to obtain a copy. Because of 
such lack of &quot;hardcopy evidence&quot; I have to omit his name here. It is 
for the sake of his security. Sorry to say that, but nowadays AAWS is 
pretty hostile against members airing unwanted truth.
<p>

Bill held the opinion &quot;I made these guys sober. They have to pay my 
way.&quot;
<p>
<a name="hiding_behind"> </a>
Bill was an ardent follower of Dale Carnegie's courses, <i>&quot;How to 
influence people&quot;</i>, which he attended together with Lois back then. 
Thus Bill was intelligent enough to wrap his opinion in nice words to 
get it down the throats of others. 
<p>
<ul>
<li> He used to say WE instead of ME.<br>
<li> He used to say &quot;A.A. has saved these men and their
families,&quot; instead of &quot;I, Bill Wilson, saved these
men and their families.&quot;<br>
<li> He used to say PAY FOR OUR OFFICE instead of PAY FOR MY LIVING.<br>

<li> He had the habit of hiding behind others by saying things like
&quot;Miss Hock and I&quot; or &quot;Dr. Bob and I.&quot;  
</ul>
<p>

For instance, in a MEMORANDUM TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE 
ALCOHOLIC FOUNDATION in early 1941, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Many of us are 
beginning to feel that Alcoholics Anonymous ought to stand on its own 
feet, certainly so far as central office expenses are concerned.  It 
is probable that more than 1500 of our 2000 members are now employed.
A.A. has saved these men and their families an average of at least a 
thousand dollars a year each, let alone misery and ultimate ruin. In 
short, our total membership is going to be one million &#8212; even two 
million dollars better off this year because of A.A. Most of us 
appreciate these facts of our recovery, and I am sure that when the 
small though acute needs of our central office are made clear, the 
groups will lend a hand. In fact it is beginning to look as though 
they must if we are to carry on.&quot;
