<p>
Terrance,

<p>
Thanks for everything you've done in exposing A.A. for what it is.  Being new in a
new town here in Oregon and being at the end of my rope because of a massive relapse
after 9 years, I went to the local meeting hall and did the drill.  I was still
insecure and pretty hopeless at about 4 months when I went to the local annual A.A.
picnic.  While passing the barbeque an old crusty man flipping burgers said to me in
a low gravelly voice &quot;I want you.&quot;  Horrified, I said OH, COME ON!!! and I left the
picnic.
<p>
  Well, anyway, I pretty much forgot about it for a little over a year.  Kept
going to about two meetings a week.  On a broiling hot day in July, I was heading
into the local meeting hall wearing shorts down to my knees and a non-revealing tank
top.  Over the parking lot I went toward the door which sat adjacent to the patio
where everybody smoked.  I saw out of the corner of my eye the jerk from the picnic.
Still headed for the door,  from behind me came a wolf-whistle.  I ignored it and
went inside to sit down.  Well after the meeting started this man came in and sat
down by me during the share.  Then he put his hand on my thigh and asked how I had
been.  I gave him a dirty look and tried to pay attention to the person sharing.
Next thing I know, my sunglasses which were on the table were now on the face of the
jerk from the picnic.  I took them from him and I moved.
<p>
  Okay, so now I tell my
&quot;sponsor&quot; about what happened.  Her response was
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;there was a womanizer in the
meetings that she was from.  Even though he did those things to those women,
he still carried a great message.&quot;
</font>
   Oh my god.  O.k.  I got rid of that sponsor and
really questioned all the freaking time I have wasted going to these freaking
meetings.
<p>
  But still, not ready to completely flee the looney bin, I decided to not
go ever to any mixed meetings and to only go to women's meetings.  I thought, O.k.,
I'll give it another 6 months and decide for sure.  I took the coffee commitment,
which no one else would do.  For six months I spent 2-1/2 hours every saturday at
noon making sure everyone had their refreshments, setting up and cleaning up before
and after the meeting.  At five months into the commitment, the beloved benefactor
(who made sure from her pocket that enough funds were in the account to be sure the
meeting could continue) died.  This was a big shock to me and everyone else.  The
final straw for me, after 25 freaking years going in and going out of A.A., 20 of
those years being sober, though not &quot;continuously&quot;) was when two of the people with
over 10 years sobriety did two things that I had never before heard of.  One went to
the funeral home and decided that our dear departed needed a big book in her casket
and put it there!!!  Not soon after, I spoke to the other one and she said she had
prevailed upon the family to take part of the ashes to put in her special urn of the
ashes of those departed.  OH MY GOD.  Bye Bye A.A.

<p>
P.S.  Wouldn't it be fun to get all of us with useless big books to have a huge
bonfire somewhere?

<p>
Yours fondly, Foggy

<p>
<font color="blue">
Or, Foggy, maybe we should put <i>all</i> of the <i>Big Books</i> in somebody's
casket and bury them. And then, oh, will the archeologists ever be in for a nasty shock.
Shades of Indiana Jones. Can you imagine opening a crypt, and a thousand Stepper ghouls
come rushing out?

<p>
Thanks for the letter and an interesting story.
<p>
I hope that you are well. So have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;William&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Rehab Cult<br>

<p>
Dear Professor Orange,

<p>
I just returned from the Las Vegas Recovery Center (LVRC) where I was being
treated for chronic pain (2 back fusion surgeries) and the resulting 3-year
opiate addiction.

<p>
The 90-day program was effective in getting me off pain killers and Valium,
and my pain from the surgeries is now gone since having had extensive
physical therapy. The Asian modalities helped as well, especially the
meditation and acupuncture. To be sure, the nursing and most of the regular
staff were polite and professional, but eventually I sensed that there was
something amiss, something strangely palpable in the very ether.

<p>
I kept an open mind during my captivity, but after 5 weeks the AA/NA
doctrine was massively intensified; the illogical information, slogans, and
core message first mystified, then truly frightened me.

<p>
My counselor, a demimonde demagogue among demagogues, was aghast at the
notion I was (gasp!) an atheist, and kept badgering me night and day by
saying: &quot;Listen here you, you better get a higher power or you WILL relapse
and die!&quot; I first chose Capt. James T. Kirk, then Yoda, and finally The
Force from Star Wars, but he thought otherwise. I then chose Buddhism as a
serious replacement, a good choice, but he quickly proceeded to tell me to
&quot;pray to the Buddha&quot;.........my heart and mind then slowly sank in the
quicksand of his matchless ignorance and  buffoonery.

<p>
He also lectured our patient group on the 12 steps, and delighted in
slamming down my, and every one's, pertinent and intelligent questions with:
&quot;That's just your addiction talking!&quot;...&quot;If you follow the NA way and work
the steps diligently you will never ever relapse, and if you don't, you WILL
die!&quot;...&quot;You're in denial!...stop asking ridiculous (i.e. clever, erudite)
questions!&quot; &quot;Powerlessness!...surrender!...more will be revealed!&quot; (?)
None of the neocortex-numbing diatribe made any real, rational sense, and if
addiction is a *genetic disease*....why all the guilt, moral failings, and
shame? What about Cancer patients?...should they feel shame? Or the young
girl with us with Crone's Disease? She was the bravest and toughest of all
of us patients by far.

<p>
&quot;Recovery in NA/AA is counter-intuitive!!!&quot; he and other counselors shouted
enthusiastically. What in the *hell?* Their whole 5th grade-level dog and
pony show certainly seemed decidedly counter-intuitive to most of us.

<p>
Suddenly the similarities dawned on me...... I've studied this before in
Russian History, my college major: &quot;Workers unite!&quot;... &quot;The motherland is
everything!&quot;... Long live the Soviet national intelligentsia &#8212; active builders
of communism!&quot;

<p>
The cadre of counselors (zealotry redefined, purified, and petrified) would
also tell people to get down on their knees and pray in the morning, and
took special interest in my plight by all trying to convince
me, *Beelzebub's protege*, (their quote actually) at various times, of the existence of God
&#8212; by
telling me that my &quot;addiction&quot; was causing my atheism. (Even though I have
been an atheist since age 10, and even though I'm not anti-religious at all.)
One friend of mine, a fellow dissident, had to quote and read the Bible with
his counselor before being allowed to use the phone to call home. (All calls
were monitored in the presence of at least 2-3 staff.) I can surely see why
people want to leave treatment early.

<p>
Amazingly, 90% of the staff were all former addicts. I wondered at the
wisdom of this august decision by the LVRC board members, but since the
NA-loving CEO is one too I see the logic, however twisted. I can understand
how that might help in certain situations, but in the end we all felt the
condescension and burning distrustfulness in the staff's piercing, inky
black eyes. Most of the staff, except the nurses, were fit and fierce  NA/AA
Nazi stormtroopers, and I foolishly, in the beginning weeks, luxuriated in
goose-stepping around and raising my arm in a mock &quot;SIEG-HEIL!&quot;  (I was
summarily punished by the Obergruppenfuhrers George and Frank, the no. 2 and
no.3 in charge of the facility.)

<p>
We patients were forced to go to AA/NA meetings every single night and were
told that non-compliance meant automatic expulsion. (No matter what the
chronic pain clients were feeling in terms of agony levels) These people
were playing with our very lives!  Policy and rules are one thing, but I saw
myself and many of my compatriots sink into deep depression by all the
propaganda, creative half-truths, and forced cognitive restructuring. The
meetings in Vegas by and large were chock full of ex-cons, gang-bangers,
gang bikers, dealers, hookers, street urchins, and low-lifers of all shapes
and sizes who sanctimoniously criticized us for being &quot;Tourists&quot; and not
real NA fascist believers.
<p>
 Several of us found the meetings to be quite
cliquish and clannish in nature, with varying degrees of outright distrust
and sometimes genuine, albeit veiled hostility towards newcomers not like
themselves. Frankly, I was scared to share at all during my three months,
not that I felt I had anything of pertinence to talk about except for my
utter distaste for our simian-simpleton of a counselor who's only
professional background was as a used car salesman. (He did not even have a
degree in counseling... only a community college one for something totally
unrelated to recovery.) He and other counselors, blatantly brandishing their
NA multiple-year clean time black tags like trophies, relished the role of
playing junior psychologists, their ego puffery  clearly boosted after every
torturous patient one-on-one meeting. We patients unanimously agreed the
counselors were furthering their own recoveries* through us on a daily basis*,
 and their  illogical, counter-intuitive non-sequiturs flowed like a snow
melt-fed mountain stream out of their amply-sized mouths during the endless
and repetitive thrice-daily lectures.
<p>
 (Note: I actually liked most of the
local Vegas people I met, (staff, nurses, and others) so I hope this does
not offend, as no offense is intended to those denizens of &quot;sin city&quot;.)
<p>
 It's
difficult to know just how the American pilots downed on Borneo in WW2 felt
of the Dayak headhunters with their shrunken Japanese trophy heads, but
suddenly I could sense an inkling.... I had been saved physically, but...

<p>
I immediately began to see similarities in our indoctrination to NA/AA, akin
to KGB interrogation tactics and ones used by myriad cult religions
worldwide. (&quot;So, why did you try to assassinate our dear comrade
Molotov?.... you deny it?... off to Gulag!..... what's that?... oh now you admit
it?... good for you comrade, a proper confession will do you well......... now
off to Gulag on trans-Siberian railway!... and pray to your higher power
comrade Stalin while you travel, the time goes by so very much quicker that
way.)

<p>
If we, the distrustful hapless patients kept on asking the &quot;wrong type&quot;
(their moniker) of questions or questioning the staff's &quot;circular logic&quot;,
(my moniker) we were sent to the facility commanders and duly punished. They
would threaten us by stating they would call our spouses and families and
say we were being troublesome, disruptive, and that we were in denial by not
accepting and working the LVRC &quot;program&quot;. Fragile marriages were stressed to
the breaking point, two people were served divorce papers, and even my own
was strained. Luckily for me I have two friends who had been in rehab before
and they briefed my wife accordingly. One particular former addict Nazi
staffer, the rotund man-beast Frank, would routinely, rudely, and cruelly
hammer our family members on their own &quot;perceived&quot; issues when they visited
for family weekends. Not a solitary person liked him, but everyone certainly
feared him. One of my family commented that Frank could convince anyone of
being some kind of enabler or addict, even the Dali Lama. (addicted to
peaceful meditation no doubt. Tsk, tsk....)

<p>
We were also forced to work steps 1-6 to completion. I had few
&quot;resentments&quot;, and no &quot;moral failings&quot; I could think of, but was told by my
peers to make some up or I would get into real trouble. If our step 4 was
not at least 35 pages in length we were told to keep writing. I became very
anxious and depressed at the thought of having some holy-rolling sponsor
bang on me the rest of my life after going to oppressive, angry,
nonconstructive, and thoroughly spirit-crushing meetings. (Keep coming back
you jerks!)

<p>
The LVRC staff and my appointed temporary sponsor told me that was the ONLY
way to stay sober, so I better get over it. They hammered my wife and
parents on every detail and tried to convince my wife to go to Alanon or
Narcanon and work the steps and get a sponsor herself. She does not have any
substance problems at all  &#8212;  she and I are still confused and angered by
this action. Soon I began to see similarities to Gestapo intelligence
tactics emerging as well; they staff felt threatened by my knowledge of
history and society to such an extent as to warn me not to inform my fellow
patients on The Cochrane Report, Project Match, (BMC Public Health report)
huckster bullshit-slinger Bill W., Herr &quot;anti-Semite&quot; Jung and &quot;cocaine wine
for everybody&quot; Freude. (I'm a historian, filmmaker, and writer by
profession. My friends and therapist smuggled me information inside
magazines and books as we had severely restricted internet access)

<p>
The head doctor, Dr. P., a family practitioner, not an addiction specialist
although he claimed to be, routinely mocked us and fed us unsubstantiated
claims such as &quot;*Hyperalgesia* is only found in addicts, that's why your
pain got worse as you took more drugs. *...it was your own fault*.&quot; This is
fatally wrong in that there is no data to suggest one is AUTOMATICALLY an
addict because one was in the throes of H.A. (The short-circuiting of the
limbic system, see: WEBMD)
<p>
The doctor thus accused me of being a &quot;slippery character and a liar&quot;
because I asked the question in public. One staff pseudo-psychologist also
said he could tell we were addicts because we were &quot;smart, vindictive
grudge-holders, and overly sensitive&quot;. He could *just tell?* ...wow, he's
good! Some of us were decidedly not sensitive or vindictive at all, although
in my case he publicly said I was a &quot;smart-ass.&quot; (For once, a proper
deduction based on facts.)

<p>
Where was the hard data backing up all of their conclusions? No doctor I
contacted at Johns Hopkins agreed with the head doctor's assessments on
several topics, even my surgeon and two top anesthesiologists with extensive
addiction training.
<p>
Dr. P. also demanded carte blanche in regards to obtaining information from
my family and psychologist when I was still reeling from being detoxed on
their cocktail of drugs. I refused at first, but he eventually wore me down
with threats and statements like: &quot;We wont be able to help you at all if you
don't cooperate...you will then relapse upon release with 100%
certainty.&quot; &#8212; &quot;Physician, heal thy self!&quot;  (My therapist was smart enough
to know his game, and told him precious little. Treating CIA, NSA, and FBI
agents has taught my guy a thing or two, hence The Cochrane Report fell into
my hands much to everyone's consternation and befuddlement. They found it
when they searched my room and I was back on punishment.... no mail other
than cards from my wife opened personally by my counselor)

<p>
This is professional TREATMENT?.... more like we were &quot;getting the
treatment&quot;, by forcibly being made to swallow their Kool-Aid by the barrel
head. The doctor also accused me of snorting my pills and doctor-shopping
for more than my approved dosages.... this was absolutely untrue and
substantiated by my family, but I'm sure you can guess what he thought as he
giggled, stroked his scraggly goatee, and chortled: &quot;Yeah, right!&quot; in
impudent reply to my deaf-eared befallen rebuttal. My respect for him
evaporated like a thin coating of rubbing alcohol in the desert sun, and I
never have felt so utterly and helplessly alone as at that moment of
stinging, acrid clarity. The gauntlet thrown, covert war was thus
inevitable, so I used the only viable weapon in my limited arsenal, I
wielded my own psychology on them in order to survive by conducting myself
politely, being outwardly cooperative, but inwardly rebellious and
fractious. Though I freely admit I sowed quiet dissent among certain
patients  with similar misgivings  &#8212;  (we had 3 doctors, a lawyer, and several
other highly educated professionals as patients.... the staff obviously
preferred the younger, more ignorant patients because they were easier to
cajole, manipulate, and control, unlike the rest of us who could actually
think rationally for ourselves)  &#8212;  I never put any one's recovery in
jeopardy with my humor or respectful questioning, as I only related, quoted,
and asked for the *truth* based on hard facts and logic, two things in very
short supply indeed.

<p>
I never once heard an utterance about CBT, REBT, SMART or MFS/WFS or the
fact that personal responsibility, psychotherapy, non 12-step support
groups, family, friends, self-control, nutrition, exercise, discipline, good
habits, and willpower were important tools. They said to quit my
Psychologist, not rely on family and friends, and just work the steps with a
sponsor, a tougher one the better for me in particular. When I flatly
refused they said I was &quot;acting out of self will&quot;.... &quot;get rid of your
stinkin' thinkin'&quot; and that &quot;my ego was controlling me and wanted me dead.&quot;
<p>
They also said if I exercised too much that was just shifting addictions!
 &#8212;  I slowly and solidly felt as if I was becoming a continuously re-frozen
and microwaved Hot Pocket of a tortured soul who was at once grateful for my
chronic pain medical treatment and wholly resentful of being repeatedly,
cognitively dry-cleaned at every given opportunity.

<p>
I must say I was gleefully surprised and elated when your website handily
confirmed my own, my doctors', (and some of my LVRC peers) perceptions and
findings on all the &quot;recovery&quot; treatments that are based on 12-step
programs. I cannot believe how much money, time, brain cells, and spirit I
wasted on the second half of that bloody program. How they can mix proper
medical science and therapy with indigenous people's head-hunting /
shrinking superstitious prattle mixed with equal portions of Haitian
headless chicken Voodoo is beyond my greater understanding..... especially
given the few real and properly educated professionals that exist there. The
only staff member, a notable clinical psychologist and addiction expert we
truly trusted, liked, respected, and understood was actually not on staff
and not a former addict! He was a subcontractor, sincerely dedicated, and
now I see why he refused their repeated offers.

<p>
I'm sure from what I experienced that 12-step programs work for some and
that's fine and dandy, but if LVRC and other facilities really want to save
lives they need a more balanced, flexible, and individualized approach to
recovery techniques, ditch the one-sized-fits-all blanket philosophy, and
shouldn't give in to mandatory brainwashing and NA/AA psychological warfare.
The concept of non-12-step recovery facilities is finally taking shape in
California I'm told, which proves the urgent need for them.

<p>
North Korea should send a spy to learn a few things by posing as a patient
at LVRC, but then, even I would not wish such a fate to befall him. Better
yet, let us send my Neanderthal of a former counselor to treat Premier Kim
over there, never to return.

<p>
I will keep you informed of my intentions of writing a Op-Ed piece for a
major newspaper in the Eastern U.S., a task suggested to me by my family and
doctors. The public has a need and right to know the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

<p>
Keep up the good fight. Never so few.

<p>
Best regards,<br>
William

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello William,
<p>
Thank you for a very revealing letter, and thank you for the compliments.
<p>
Your analogy to North Korean brainwashing may be far more apt than you realize.
The A.A. mind-bending tactics were all derived from the Oxford Group cult religion
of the 1930s, of
course, and then the Oxford Group got renamed in 1938 to &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;.
Well, during the Korean War, a member of Moral Re-Armament was in the Army in Korea,
and he got captured by the
North Koreans, and he was subjected to the Chinese Communist brainwashing program.
He marvelled that it was just like a Moral Re-Armament meeting &#8212; the enforced self-criticism
and confession sessions, and thought-stopping slogans, and you are a piece of shit but the
leader is perfect and cannot be criticized, The Program (Communism) Is Perfect,
and dogma over personal experience, and dispensed existence, and illogical beliefs...
It was all
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="newwin422">the same stuff</a>.

<p>
So, what to do? I think we just have to keep up the publicity, and let the world
know what is really going on in those so-called &quot;treatment centers&quot;.
And let politicians know. And cut funding to such quack outfits.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Something's wrong here.  Living again off society at 63 ?  Surely with all your

let you crash out on their couch while you found new digs ?

Even if ONE PERCENT gave you a dollar via Pay Pal you would have more money than you

You are way behind the curve, Tom. I've had another apartment since late April.
<p>
I don't make any money off of the web site. I carry no advertising. Most of the
requests to carry ads come from treatment centers that sell the 12 Steps.
And I can't do that.

<p>
The reason why it took so long to find another apartment was because I wanted to
find a good one, at a low price. I did not want to sign a year lease on a bad apartment where I
didn't want to live. And I finally found a good place to live.
<p>
The rest of your rap is just a lame attempt to claim that there is something wrong with

Subject:  	AA Kidnappers?<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange,
<p>
It seems to me after reading your website that it is entirely possible for
an AA Sponsor to keep a person against their will in the name of &quot;the
greater good.&quot;  My daughter, 19 yrs old, went of her own accord to this
house.  I now believe she is being held against her will.  Do you have any
insight or advice?  She suffers from depression, etc.  I am afraid she will
attempt and maybe succeed at a suicide.  Thank you.

Hello Denise,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer your letter. I got way backlogged on email while
looking for another place to live.
<p>
The first thing I would do is contact the police. They may well be able to help,
especially if your daughter is in danger. I don't know what the age of majority is
in Texas; whether your daughter is considered legally an adult, or whether
you still have legal custody. Still, it seems
like you should have some say in the matter, especially if she is suffering from
depression and is not entirely mentally competent. Perhaps Child Welfare Services
can also help.
<p>
Readers: any other ideas?
<p>
Have a good day and good luck now.

<p>
Hey man why all the hate on AA?  Shouldn't we be happy with anything that may bring
a glimmer of hope to alcoholics and addicts?  If it isn't hurting anyone and the
steps are mere suggestions, then what's the issue?  I am a man who could find no
peace and hurt, destroyed, and pushed away everything good in my ife... then I found
this simple program thats only requirements were to try and let in some new ideas...
I am the problem and that something bigger then me, I call him God, is the
solutions.    We don't lay or sins out for forgiveness, we write out all the shit we
have done to others, all the resentments that we carry in our minds so we don't have
so many  blocks between god and ourselves... simple stuff... didn't believe the
first through but what do you know it worked.. hope.   I know I  probably can't
change your mind but who knows the universe works kind of oddly.   I will end with
this, I don't believe in everything that is done or said in the AA community today..
most of it goes against the traditions laid down by those before us, but I can't
judge AA based on that but I can carry the message like it has been written clear
and precise.. actually that is my only job today.. not to save you, give you a job,
give you money or a place to sleep... but to walk you through these 12 steps just
like it was done for me...  thanks for your time... and try to ease up on AA a tad.

From:  	&quot;Z.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Wonderful work, thanks for waking me up.<br>

<p>
Hey Orange,

<p>
I wanted to write to thank you for the wonderful work you've done with your
website. You've taught me so much about how to critically analyze groups
before becoming too deeply invested in them.

<p>
I'm a former member of the Alateen program. To be more precise, I'm in the
process of quitting the program, but I'm having some trouble getting around
my mother's emotional manipulation. She's been in Al Anon for about 16
years &#8212; I know your analysis is geared toward debunking AA, but most of your
criticisms apply to all twelve step programs. Anyway, she entered at a low
point in her life. Since then, she's made some friends who happily share her
views. By now, she almost never talks to people outside &quot;the rooms&quot; anymore.

<p>
So I grew up having bits of the 12 step ideology fed to me. I resisted going
for a while, but she waited until I came home from school upset by bullies
one day. As she tells the story to her friends now, she waited until I was
weak and vulnerable to force me into the program. And she's *proud* of that.
It didn't bother me once I was completely immersed in stepper dogma, but now
that the fog's started to clear that strikes me as extremely disturbing.

<p>
So I served the twelve step program happily and unquestioningly for four
years after that. By the time I was 18, I'd started to have some concerns.
During one meeting, I was scolded for bringing in scientific  facts about
alcoholism with the usual &quot;that's not conference approved literature&quot; line.
I asked Mom why scientific studies weren't allowed, and she said &quot;we don't
want to dilute the program with other ideologies&quot;. Scientific facts are an
ideology now? This bothered me so much. If this program was the way for me
to get better, why didn't we want the truth? I soon learned that this was
because it *wasn't* the way.

<p>
Then I began to question the value of surrendering to God and confessing my
sins in order to improve my relationship with my alcoholic father. How
exactly had his drinking made me the one with problems that needed to be
cured? No one ever gave me an answer that I could accept.

<p>
After a while, I decided that although the 'fellowship' was nice enough if
you made all the logic twists needed to fit the mold, I needed to quit and
find my own path. My mom was extremely unhappy about this, and she kept
using emotional blackmail to make me stay in the program. &quot;If you stop
going, the meeting will die and all your friends will have nowhere to go!&quot;
Because I'm a spineless wimp, I went along with it for another year to keep
her happy.

<p>
Then, she finally asked me why I'd started to object to going to meetings. I
told her about what I'd learned and discovered. When she asked me where I'd
gotten these ridiculous ideas, I mentioned this site. To that, she said
&quot;This man who sits around criticizing AA all day obviously doesn't
understand the program. If he did, it would all make sense! Critics just
complain because they're not strong enough to succeed in recovery and
they're jealous of the ones who have.&quot; When I explained my own religious and
spiritual rejections that I'd formed without your site, she came out with
&quot;You're one of those impossible to please atheists who wants to erase God
from public life, aren't you? Stop complaining so much and let everyone
worship God, it's not hurting you.&quot;

<p>
She never answered my concerns directly. She either attacked you for not
&quot;getting&quot; the program or me for coming from a &quot;whiny atheist&quot; perspective.
Even the &quot;recovery rate same as spontaneous remission rate&quot; evidence did
nothing to sway her, because scientists &quot;just don't get it&quot; either. The
possibility that the program might be wrong never, ever occurs to her.

<p>
So at the moment I'm attempting to stand up to Mom's manipulation and quit.
Thank you for the help and the inspiration to do my own research.

Hello Z,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
I'm sorry to hear about all of your difficulties.
Having a mother who &quot;drank the koolaid&quot; is a tough one.
<p>
You are right about how the information in the Orange Papers is also applicable to
any 12-Step groups. Heck, it's even applicable to Scientology and the Moonies,
and a zillion other cults.
They all use the same thought-stopping techniques, and the same rejection of
outside information. In Scientology, any true information from outside
of Scientology is rejected because it is not &quot;LRH Tech&quot; &#8212;
meaning, not &quot;Lafayette Ronald Hubbard Technology&quot;.

<p>
As you have already noticed, your mother does not want to hear the truth.
It is &quot;not Conference-approved&quot;.  She just wants her favorite beliefs repeated without
criticism or critical thought. She likes her little social group and she doesn't
want to hear anything negative about it.
Yes, that is what keeps cults going. 
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>
I don't know of any easy answer there. She does not want to change her beliefs, so
she probably won't. She has been in Al-Anon for 16 years, so it is her life now.
As you have noticed, she just has a few simple-minded ways of dealing with facts
that she dislikes &#8212; just reject the information, and attack the speaker with
 <a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="newwin231">ad-hominems</i></a> like
&quot;He's an atheist&quot; or &quot;He doesn't understand&quot; or &quot;He sits on his duff&quot;.
Or, &quot;You are coming from a whiny atheist perspective.&quot;
She never addresses the real facts. That is because her position is indefensible, and she
secretly knows it.

<p>
She does not want to know the truth. That's it: Game, Set, and Match. All that you can
do is save your own mind.
It is sad seeing people commit mental suicide, but it happens all of the time.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hey Orange,

<p>
So glad I ran across you website. I used to go to A.A. I quit after awhile,
I never could make it past the first few steps. It made me cringe just to
think I would have to go there some days and tell them every little thing I
had ever done in my life. Yes it is shame they want people to put out. I
just found your site today. Will definitely be commenting more at another
time. In the meantime I have family members who do to A.A. but we don't
speak. If you are not A.A. you are not good enough for them.

Subject:  	RE: a book &quot;the twelve precepts of AA&quot;<br>

<p>
High Orange,

<p>
Thanks for taking the time to respond to my e-mail.

<p>
Are you aware of the book &quot;The Twelve Precepts of AA&quot;  and have you read it ?

<p>
When one is One With The Universe, there is no either or.

<p>
There is no Plan.

<p>
Since you are occupying this Universe you are bound by its reality.

<p>
Since you are occupying this planet you are bound by its reality.

<p>
To speak of being one with the Universe, presumes you are one with the planet.

<p>
Universal Love and Compassion is the only path to Nirvana.

<p>
To manifest the Divine within you is your joy, to become god, brings you beyond god.

<p>
To speak of Love Compassion Justice, while three billion of you brothers and sisters
have nothing but pain and suffering, the planet is being destroyed in front of your
eyes,and you sit back thinking you are one with the universe and this is all part of
the PLAN !

<p>
Its not that easy my friend, some people are bought by money or fame, or power. Others
by ego, lust, hatred, envy,fear, delusion. These traps are the basics, not worthy of
any serious effort. Easily taken by those who are part of the inner circle, such as
those who control AA, various religious leaders, heads of states.

<p>
The energy against you is directly proportional to your level of consciousness.

<p>
The shock of realization of what you are up against is enough to drive you to insanity.

<p>
If you survive the realization, or have this realization, you can appreciate how
insidious
and all encompassing this PLAN of world domination and destruction is. The fact that
you
see through this veil of darkness means that you have manifested the divine within you.

<p>
You are of the light and beyond the darkness you are one with all that came before,

<p>
You job is to lift the veil of darkness, you are beyond good and evil, all that you
can do
is assist other sentient beings in their journey to self-realization the outcome is
not preordained. Knowing the why of the current situation is beyond our pay scale, if
the shit hits the fan we continue on.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Frank,
<p>

From:  	&quot;PJ&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank You<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I have been in AA for 16 years and been very active at attending meetings and
retreats. Your information on this site is very valuable to me and I really
appreciate your perspective. My overall life has not gotten better over time and I
am mostly unmotivated and lay around in bed a lot. I used to be very motivated and
involved in my jobs and life in general. Some have called this a depression, but I
can get motivated to do certain things, like go to meetings or the part time job I
have, so it is not a depression.

<p>
After reviewing the site, I can see how my psyche may have been effected by the
infusion of AA doctrine into my belief system. Powerless, sinful, unable to think in
your own best interest and requiring a God to give me proper guidance is a recipe
for disaster for any self motivated, intelligent and successful  person. I looked at
my resume recently and can see my accomplishments in the past when I believed I had
the ability to create my own reality. Where did that person go?

<p>
Starting at about five years of sobriety my life has taken a nose dive and I am
seriously in debt and working part time at a job that is beneath me, and raiding my
401k. I have had my suspicions about AA for a while and have seen how you don't
bring up the dissention with true believers &#8212; either about the program or about God.
Also, I see others with longer-term sobriety and their lives are in various states
of turmoil and look around the meeting rooms and realize there is no one in the room
with anything I want. It may be ok for them to think it is Gods's will to be
cleaning toilets at 30 years of sobriety because they don't want to attempt to excel
at anything, but that is not for me. Call it ego on my part, I don't care. I am in
possession of above average intellect and in good health and I should be using my
attributes to the best advantage for myself and society. Not cowering in a chair in
an AA meeting because I am afraid of dying from drinking, and pretending that my
life is great because I am in AA, while at the same time &quot;working&quot; a program that is
robbing me of true fulfillment. My version of fulfillment, not AA's.

<p>
I am afraid that the dogma has altered me in a subtle way that I can not make my way
out of.   I'm not looking for blame, I am looking for answers so that I can make the
right changes and get my life back on track, but the absorption of AA dogma puts me
at a serious disadvantage &#8212; If I believe my thinking is broken, then any solution
that  I come up with will probably be wrong, so how do I know what is right? This
mental loop is very dangerous and de-motivating and I need to find a solution where
there is true personal empowerment, not simply empowerment that is designed to
propagate the group.

<p>
This is really frightening and going to more meetings, or reading the Big Book, or
working with others is not the answer &#8212; it just postpones me from finding the true
answers to my questions.

<p>
Thanks for reading and thanks again for this very valuable information &#8212; I wanted to
stop drinking, not be required to adopt a religion !

Hello PJ,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I think you are waking up, and that your life will soon
get better.
<p>
First off, you are not insane. Insane people are notorious for insisting that they are not
insane &#8212; like Bill Wilson:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are convinced that a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful
health restorative. We, who have recovered from serious drinking, are miracles
of mental health.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, <i>The Family Afterward</i>, page 133.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But dependence upon an A.A. group or Higher Power hasn't produced
any baleful results.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 38.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Insane people, especially narcissistic people like Bill Wilson, cannot stand the 
thought that their thinking might be anything less than brilliant and stellar.
People who question their own sanity are called &quot;normal&quot;.
<p>
You are quite right that if you fall into the trap of believing that your thinking
is defective, then you doubt all of your thinking, including that thinking.
That just leads to a neat paradox:
<p>
<ol>
<li> You think that your thinking is defective.
<li> But that means that the previous thought is also defective, and wrong.
<li> So you aren't insane after all.
<li> But that means that you were correct when you said that your thinking was defective.
<li> So you are insane and defective after all.
<li> But that means that the previous thought is also defective, and wrong.
<li> So you aren't insane after all.
<li> But that means that you were correct when you said that your thinking was defective.
<li> So you are insane and defective after all.
<li> etc., etc. ...
</ol>
<p>
The easiest way of out the trap is &quot;Don't worry about it. Go do something else.&quot;
<p>
What I recommend is exercises to strengthen your will. When you begin each day,
you &quot;set your will&quot; by planning something to do. Maybe you will go to the library
today, or you will take out the garbage, or wash the dishes. It could be anything.
But you do it. When you do it, you gain a little bit of energy, and your will becomes
stronger.
<p>
You gradually build up to doing more things per day, and more difficult things, too.
And your will gradually grows stronger. You will begin to feel yourself taking charge
of your life again.
You will begin to realize that you really can do the things that you want to do.

<p>
It is very much like, if you were physically out of shape, you would not just suddenly
try to do 100 push-ups and 100 pull-ups, and then condemn yourself when you couldn't do
them. Just start where you are, and build yourself up.
<p>
Oh, and speaking of physical exercise, get some. Exercise is really good for overcoming
depression and lethargy. Walk or ride a bicycle or something, but do something. Get out in the fresh
air and sunshine. It is officially summertime now. It's beautiful out there.
You can put that on your list of willpower exercises, too.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day, and a good life.

From:  	&quot;Brian H.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Your stance on AA<br>

<p>
I've read through some of your article and although you do make some valid
criticisms of the AA program, some of your statements are very misleading.
Granted AA does state that your soberity needs to be your #1 priority, I
have never heard anyone  say
 &quot;<a href="orange-letters.html#Linda" target="newwin401">Dump your spouse
and marry the A.A. group.....</a>&quot; The thought process behind making soberity
your primary focus is similar to conventional wisdom that states &quot; if you
can't take care of yourself, how do you expect to take care of
your________(job, wife, kids, etc).&quot;
<p>
  I guess more to the point of my e-mail
is what is it about AA that you find so distasteful.
<p>
 I am a recovering
alcoholic who will have 5 years sober this Tuesday, thanks to the grace of a
higher power I chose to call God. OK, so the last part of that sentence was
my dig at some AA speak. I credit my soberity to my willingness to change
and to AA. Had I not found a support group in AA I don't know if I would
have stopped drinking or not. The fact that a lot of people can quit
drinking through means other than AA is great (either through shear will
power, RBT, etc) but that does not mean that AA has no value to the
alcoholic still in the grips of his/her self-destructive behavior. I may not
believe in all the tenets of AA (or most of the tenets of AA for that
matter) but it is a group that anyone, anywhere can walk into and find help.
And like any other type of recovery vehicle (be it a self-help group, a
therapist, etc), if the first group (or therapist or whatever) you encounter
doesn't give you the support you need than you should move on and find
another group (or therapist or whatever) that gives you the support you
need.
<p>
 There are two very important things I learned in AA, one was the idea
of acceptance, which means there is an awful lot of stuff in the world and
my life that I don't like and have no power to change and if I can't get
away from the stuff, I have to learn to accept. Why get upset about things I
can't change, it is far better to accept these things and move on with life.
(Granted some people can use this as an excuse for certain things, that is
not how I apply this principle in my life).
<p>
 The other thing I learned is
when I go to a meeting, or listen to a speaker or therapist or read a
self-help book, etc I should &quot;take the good and leave the rest&quot;. Meaning
that almost everyone has something of value to say and I should pay
attention to those little bits of wisdom and not worry about all the stuff
that person may be saying that I find distasteful, stupid, etc.
<p>
 Those two
little bits of wisdom have helped me quite a bit over the years. Are they
simple ideas that are probably self-evident to more people, maybe, but I
needed to have someone point them out to my and dicuss them with me and I
found those people in AA.
<p>
 So I guess the morale of this e-mail is that AA
tries to do a lot of good and even with its' flaw, has been a help to many
people who needed a support system in their lives to get and maintain some
soberity.

Hello Brian,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You objected to:

&quot;<a href="orange-letters.html#Linda" target="newwin401">Dump your spouse
and marry the A.A. group.....</a>&quot;
<br>
Well, I have gotten quite a number of letters from people who have described how A.A. destroyed
their marriages. These four stand out:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors" target="newwin41">this horror story</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters79.html#tc_nightmare" target="newwin46b">Another treatment center nightmare</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters97.html#na_cult" target="newwin47d">a sad story of Narcotics Anonymous,
the &quot;sexual, social cult&quot;</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters121.html#horror" target="newwin43b">...we are getting divorced,
and I think it all comes down to her sponsor and AA indoctrination...</a>
</ol>
<p>
(The whole list of A.A. horror stories
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="newwin17">is here</a>.)

<p>
And look at the actual <i>Big Book</i> lectures:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I decided I <font color="#9F0000">must</font>
place this program above everything else, even my family, because if I
did not maintain my sobriety I would lose my family anyway.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition &#8212; Chapter B10, <i>He Sold Himself Short</i>, page 293.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Even after she remarries, she doesn't lose sight of her priorities.
She places God first and A.A. second. Her husband is never more than the third most
important aspect of her life.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Big Book Unplugged; A Young Person's Guide to Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
John R., page 107.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
You know, many spouses will &quot;have a resentment&quot; over being
told that they are less important than a cult religion.

<p>
And even Bill Wilson himself, in the <i>Big Book</i>, approved of
A.A. breaking up marriages &#8212; he just did it in a deceptive, dishonest way, bragging
about how divorce was rare in A.A., while
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#go_without_rancor">telling the wives not to make a noisy fuss
as they left</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Permanent marriage breakups and separations, however, are unusual in A.A.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 117.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The first principle of success is that you should never be angry. Even
though your husband becomes unbearable and you have to leave him temporarily,
you should, if you can, go without rancor. Patience and good temper are
most necessary.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 8, <i>To Wives</i>, page 111.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then Bill said that those separated couples should not get back together until the wife
understands that A.A. is now more important than her: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If there be divorce or separation, there should be no undue haste
for the couple to get together. The man should be sure of his recovery.
The wife should fully understand his new way of life. If their old
relationship is to be resumed it <font color="#9F0000">must</font>
be on a better basis, since the former did not work. This means a
new attitude and spirit all around. Sometimes it is to the best
interests of all concerned that a couple remain apart. Obviously,
no rule can be laid down. Let the alcoholic continue his program
day by day. When the time for living together has come, it will be
apparent to both parties.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, Chapter 7, page 99.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ah, the arrogance of Bill Wilson. Their &quot;old relationship&quot; didn't work before?<br>
And what exactly was wrong with the &quot;old relationship&quot;?<br>
Wasn't it that the husband drank too much alcohol?<br>
So how is it that the wife must now get a new attitude?<br>
And they should not get back together if she won't kowtow to A.A.?

<p>
Then you asked:
<font color="black">
&quot;what is it about AA that you find so distasteful.&quot;
</font>
<br>
It is good that we are going straight to the heart of the matter.<br>
And the answer is:<br>
<b>Alcoholics Anonymous fails to sober up the alcoholics, and lies about that fact a lot.</b>

<p>
It is a crime and a mortal sin to knowingly foist quack medicine on sick people, and
lie about how well it works.
Even worse, they lie in the name of God.
Everything else is a trivial detail after that.
<p>
Congratulations on your 5 years of sobriety.
<p>
Okay, so somebody taught you to accept the things that you cannot change.
That's nice, but that does not justify foisting quackery on sick people, and lying about the
success rate.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest&quot;</font>,
is a bait-and-switch trick. Soon, that easy-going rap changes into,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The Program won't work if you don't do ALL of the Steps ALL of the time.&quot;
</font>
<br>
And then a crabby old-timer snaps:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Take what you want and leave the rest? When did this place become a cafeteria?&quot;
</font>

<p>
I wrote about that before, here:<br>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2" target="newwin812">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.</a>

<p>
You finished up with,
<font color="black">
&quot;So I guess the morale of this e-mail is that AA tries to do a lot of good...&quot;
</font>

<p>
A very perceptive old saying is:
<center>
<font size="+1"><b>The opposite of good is &quot;good intentions&quot;.</b></font>
</center>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
