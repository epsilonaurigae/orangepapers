From:  	&quot;Laura K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Another Pointless Letter<br>

<p>

I am a greatful member of Al-Anon for 9 years now.  My husband is in AA
and just celebrated 1 year sober.  My life was hell before This program
helped.  It has helped and I love it.  I am truely happy.

<p>

I am amazed and in aww of the research and time you have put into this
website.  I am glad you believe you have found a purpose in life.  What
exactly are you trying to accomplish is my only question.  Your own
personal entertainment??

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Laura,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Since that is such an important question, I'll answer it right now.
My goal is to get the truth out there, so that people who are fighting with
drug or alcohol addiction problems will have some accurate information on
which to base decisions.
A.A. just lies so much that somebody has to tell the truth.

</font>
<p>



I know that the support that I have found in
this program is something I could not have found anywhere else.  The
peace of mind and happiness I have found is so amazing.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Translation: A.A. meetings make you feel good.
Your philosophy is hedonism:
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#hedonism"><i>If it feels good, it is good</i></a>.
<p>
That is also the philosophy of alcoholism and drug addiction, of course.
</font>
<p>



I don't
understand why you feel what you have produced is going to help anyone.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Because a lot of people say that true information has helped them.
</font>
<p>



I dont know if you have ever lived with alcoholism or known anyone that
is an alcoholic.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Well then, you are complaining about my web site without actually reading it,
aren't you? I have talked about my alcoholism a lot. Start with the introduction,
and continue. Here are some easy links for you:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">Intro to A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">Bait-and-switch treatment</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">Friends driven away from help by the 12-step nonsense</a>
</ol>
<p>
</font>
<p>


My life was definately on the down hill before I found
Al-Anon.  Today I am happy.  Can you tell me another way of doing
this??  Probably not.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. There are many ways, and the heart of all of them is:
<center>
JUST DON'T DRINK ANY MORE ALCOHOL.
</center>

You don't have to join a cult religion to quit drinking.
</font>
<p>

You sight so many different people, I bet if I wasted my time looking I
could find quotes to demean everything on your site.  What would it
accomplish?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, but it matters whom you cite, and what they say.
Are they telling the truth, or are they lying?
<p>
If you were to cite someone like
Susan Cheever, who praises Bill Wilson so much that she thinks
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Cheever1">it's a jolly good thing to practice necromancy</a>
and talk to the spirits of the dead
like Bill Wilson did, well, that wouldn't be much supporting evidence
for claims that Bill Wilson was okay.
</font>
<p>
<a name="AA_works_1"> </a>
Your site is out to destroy (which will not happen) a
program that has helped millions of people.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No it hasn't. That is the Big Lie of Alcoholics Anonymous. It has not saved or
sobered up millions; it has merely deceived a bunch of people.
People quit drinking to save their own lives, and then A.A. steals the credit
for it, and claims that it made them quit.
</font>
<p>



What is wrong with that.
People making better lives because of AA.  I dont see the harm.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You don't see the harm because you don't want to. A.A. hurts as many people
as it helps.
</font>
<p>


The God
of my understanding is my judge.  I want to revert to old behavior and
judge you but I will leave that to my Higher Power, God.  Joke, make
fun, demean, etc do what you feel is necessary but what is it
accomplishing?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Get real. You are judging. You are simply in denial about judging.
</font>
<p>

Please tell me the answer to the problems I had before, if AA and
Al-Anon is not the way what is?  It may not be the answer for everyone
but it is the answer today for me.
<p>
<font color="blue">
We already answered this. Quitting drinking is the cure for alcoholism.
Joining a dishonest cult is not.
</font>
<p>


What you believe is the answer may
be the answer for you or someone else but Al-Anon is the answer for me,
for today.  That is how my program works.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Al-Anon? You mean you didn't even have a drinking problem? You just love the
cult? Then you definitely must go read this file:
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html">12-Step Snake Oil</a>.
It will tell you about the harm that Al-Anon does.
</font>
<p>
<a name="TIME"> </a>
PS, did you know that Dr Bob and Bill Wilson were named two of the most
100 influential people of the century.  Was your name on that list??
<p>
Laura K<br>
Indiana<br>
GREATFUL MEMBER OF AL-ANON<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Did you know that Adolf Hitler made
that same TIME magazine list? He was also one of the most influential
people of the 20th century.
<p>
And actually, Dr. Bob did not make that list. Ah, but don't feel bad.
Joseph Stalin didn't make it either.

<p>
And guess who wrote the TIME magazine article on Bill Wilson for that
&quot;TIME 100&quot; list?
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Cheever">Susan Cheever</a>,
the brown-nosing nut-case who thinks that
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Cheever1">necromancy and talking
to the dead in s&eacute;ances is perfectly normal behavior</a>.

Oh yeh, and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever4">philandering and sexually
exploiting women A.A. newcomers</a>
and lying about it
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever2">
isn't so bad either</a>.
Besides, Bill's sexual misbehavior and exploitation of sick women
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever5">should be a secret</a> because he's special....

<p>
Oh yeh, Susan Cheever had all kinds of good things to say about Bill.
Her article was a total white-wash, just another regurgitation of the standard
fairy tale. She actually went so far as to say that Bill was loaded out of his
gourd with belladonna at Town's Hospital in December of 1934, but she failed
to connect the dots and note that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">
belladonna is an extremely powerful hallucinogenic drug</a>.
That's why Bill Wilson &quot;saw God&quot; there. Susan wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
And as Wilson underwent a barbiturate-and-belladonna cure called
&quot;purge and puke,&quot; which was state-of-the-art alcoholism
treatment at the time, his brain spun with phrases from Oxford Group
meetings, Carl Jung and William James' &quot;Varieties of Religious
Experience,&quot; which he read in the hospital.<br>
...<br> 
Incarcerated for the fourth time at Manhattan's Towns Hospital in 1934,
Wilson had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience">
a spiritual awakening &#8212; a flash of white light, a liberating awareness of God</a>
&#8212; that led to the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous and Wilson's
revolutionary 12-step program, the successful remedy for alcoholism.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Healer Bill Wilson</i>, Susan Cheever, TIME 100.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh, so close. She almost noticed that Bill was hallucinating
his brains out on drugs, but she just couldn't quite bring herself to say it.
<p>
She also failed to notice that
<a href="orange-rroot060.html">Frank Buchman</a>,
not Bill Wilson, developed all of
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">the cult practices that are embedded
in the 12 Steps</a>.
<p>
And she failed to
notice that A.A. basically has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
a 100% failure rate</a> (above and beyond normal spontaneous
remission). She just parrotted all of the usual untrue slogans and myths.
<p>
That's why somebody like me has to tell the truth, just for a change.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>

Hey Orange my friend &#8212;
<p>
Good news on the paypal donation thing.  I will make a small donation
You have gotten over the line in my opinion bringing up GWB on your
site but you do own the site so what the hell.
<p>
I respect your right to post your opinion, and if I dont agree with some
of them its no biggie.
<p>
Only comment is this :  The Harvard Study is misleading......   The
hopeless, hardcore, alcoholic on the street (me) would not have  been in
that Harvard study under my definition of a HOPELESS alcoholic.  AA sees
on a  daily basis people like me coming in with our pants full of shit
and out of our minds.  AA was started for REAL alcoholics and not
problem drinkers. Do you know the type of &quot;alcoholics&quot;  Harvard was
using ?  Would be interesting  dealing with the actual people that had
the high per centage of sobriety they claim to acheived &quot;on their own.&quot;

<p>

Take Care

<p>

Tom

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and everything.
<p>
I reject the terminology of &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot;.
That was just a word game that Bill Wilson used to explain away those
alcoholics who successfully quit drinking without joining Bill's cult (like me).

<p>
You know the routine &#8212;<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If they don't quit drinking, then they are real alcoholics.<br>
If they successfully quit drinking without A.A., then they aren't real alcoholics.&quot;
</font>

<p>
I can hardly count how many times that
<a href="orange-letters35.html#real_alcoholic">the true-believer Steppers have told me</a>
that
I'm not a real alcoholic. The funny thing is, they are <i>the only</i> people
who say that. My doctor called me a &quot;late-stage alcoholic&quot;, and gave me a choice
of &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
<p>
My family and friends also regarded me as a long-term hard-core alcoholic,
and I guess some of them considered me hopeless and doomed to die drunk.
(Some of them still might.)
<p>
<a name="memory"> </a>
And I am still just physically recovering from the damage, now, after 5 years of
sobriety. With each passing month, a few more new brain cells grow and plug themselves
in, and my short-term memory gets a little better and my head gets a little clearer.
But jeez! 5 years to fix your brain damage? (Wernicke's Encephalopathy is a bitch.)

<p>
So if anybody was &quot;hopeless&quot;, I would have to fall into that category.
And yet, I still finally just got sick and tired of being sick and tired,
and decided not to die that way.
<p>
So I wasn't really so hopeless, was I?

<p>
The truth is, the whole thing about &quot;real alcoholics&quot; or &quot;hard-core alcoholics&quot;
or &quot;hopeless alcoholics&quot; is just a shades-of-gray thing.
Some are sicker than others; some are more insane than others, some
are more suicidal than others.
But there aren't any hard-and-fast lines that divide alcoholics into
&quot;ordinary&quot; versus &quot;hopeless&quot;.

<p>
And there certainly are some people &#8212; a lot of people &#8212;
who will simply decide to die drunk rather
than change their lifestyles and live without alcohol, but the whole idea of
the hopeless alcoholic who is the victim of a terrible incurable disease that
only a spiritual rememdy can cure is a myth.

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">That quote from Harvard</a>
was not the results of one study or one test.
That was the Harvard Medical School summarizing the state of the medical arts
regarding drug and alcohol treatments.
They were also summarizing the results of a lot of studies of spontaneous
remission in alcoholics and drug addicts.
So the only answer to your question about what kind of alcoholics they
were describing would be &quot;the average kind&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Rob,

<p>
Thanks for the question. That was just Bill's Bull.
It is based on nothing but Bill Wilson's imagination.

<p>

Bill was also lying with qualifiers there:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
&quot;Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

If guys didn't quit drinking, it was because &quot;they
didn't really try&quot;, so they don't count. That qualifier
allowed Bill to fabricate any numbers he wished.

From:  	&quot;John L. M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Another Letter<br>

<p>

hey, just looking up on your web site again, and you were talking about
group experiences and &quot;Everybody's doing it&quot;.  I actually had a person
say in a 12 step meeting that everybody should have a 12 step program.
<p>
Now, if we're distinguishing between ourselves and &quot;normies&quot;, why should
they have a 12 step program?
<p>
Also, if you want to see somebody go on a trip, just ask them about
going to their latest AA convention.  Do they talk about brainstorming
or ideas, or do they go on about some sort of group euphoria that seems
to envelop the group.  BTW, coming from people who've gone to national
church conventions, they talk the exact same way.  It's nothing uniquely
magical about AA.   As does the let-down afterwards when they go out
into real society and have people who won't support their group bs.
<p>
One last note:  they keep on talking about God 'as I... soon to be
we... &quot;understand it&quot;' (note how it subtly changes to God as I understand
_Him_ and references to a Creator), and how you can use a bedpan or
doorknob or the group as your personal GOD.  Two things:  one, first my
thinking is no good (&quot;your best thinking got you here&quot;), and yet I'm
supposed to now come up with a God of my understanding?  What if my God
is Bacchus or Dionysus?
<p>
Secondly, this is in regard to bedpans doorknobs and groups of drunks.
If you wanted to control a person; wouldn't the best way to do it to
first off make them do something completely and utterly insane, such as
praying to an inanimate object or a group of people?

<p>

Regards,<br>
John L

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I totally agree.
That's some good points.
&quot;If we are so different from the normies, then why do the normies need to do
the 12 Steps?&quot;
<p>
And that group euphoria thing is a classic. I know that's why a lot of people
keep going back &#8212; back to all cults in general. And Frank Buchman built his
cult on
<a href="orange-rroot720.html">that same euphoria</a>.
Like everything else about Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson just copied that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_giggly">giggly wonderfulness technique</a>
from Frank Buchman and the Oxford Groups.

<p>
And making people do something stupid sounds a lot like the way that
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_cognitive">cults
use the <i>cognitive dissonance</i> technique</a> on new recruits
&#8212; &quot;change their actions, and their thoughts will change to match their actions.&quot;


<p>
And I like to have fun asking,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Can you use Satan as your Higher Power? Why not?
Didn't Bill Wilson say that the Devil ruled this world? Can't you
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil">sell your soul to the Devil</a>
in trade for sobriety?&quot;

Subject:  	hi again<br>

<p>

Hi

<p>

Would you please explain how so many churches are fooled in to thinking
AA is Christian?

<p>
Tom

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You know, that's a great question.
I have asked myself the same thing a lot, because it is just so painfully
obvious that Alcoholics Anonymous is not even vaguely Christian.
<p>

My best guess is that the churches just don't look very closely.
They hear people yammering about God and &quot;pray a lot&quot; and
&quot;surrender your life
to God&quot;, and the preachers think that A.A. must be kindred spirits.
The ministers seem to have an attitude like, &quot;Oh well, it's a good organization
that gets drunks to stop drinking and start praying, so they are okay.&quot;
<p>

I'm pretty sure that a lot of Christian ministers and priests don't understand
that when A.A. uses religious terminology, the words don't mean what the preachers
think those words mean.

<p>
And the A.A. members sure do proclaim themselves to be &quot;Christian&quot;,
or at least &quot;compatible with Christianity&quot; a lot, and the preachers don't
seem to be too eager to notice the contradictions. (Again, don't put down
a good organization that gets the drunks praying.)

<p>
I think that a lot of it is wishful thinking. People just want to call
themselves Christians because that's the fashionable and
acceptable religion, so they do.
<p>
A.A. members reduce the label &quot;Christian&quot; to mean some
sort of &quot;generic goodness&quot;:
<ul>
<li>
If you don't kill or rob or rape too much (keep it in foreign countries),
then you must be a &quot;Christian&quot;.
<li>
If you aren't an atheist or an agnostic, then you must be a &quot;Christian&quot;.
<li>
If you occasionally say nice things about Jesus, then you must be a &quot;Christian&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
I can't help but notice that the Gospels are just loaded with Christ's instructions
to his followers to feed and clothe the poor and starving.
And yet, Bill Wilson's instructions to his followers were:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon

<p>
Hmmmm... What's wrong with this picture?

<p>
And then I could go on and on with Bill's instructions to recruiters to

I can just imagine Jesus lecturing his followers:

<p>
And then I did go on and on about the heresies of the 12-Step religion in the file
<a href="orange-heresy.html"><i>The Heresies of the 12 Steps</i></a>.

<p>
I suggest that people point out to their ministers and priests the whole
problem of the unChristian heretical nature of A.A. theology.

<p>
And then the most fun question is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Would it be okay for the local chapter
of <i>Satanists For Sobriety</i> to meet in your church basement?&quot;<br>
</font>
After all, they are a 12-Step group too, and they serve a &quot;Higher Power&quot;....

<p>

Hello Orange,
<p>
I have really been enjoying your site. I have respect
for the amount of research you have done and agree
with most of your opinions. I especially like how you
point out the lack of separation with church and state
in how the court system sentences people to AA.

<p>

Do you have any information about Doctor Silkwood, the
&quot;Doctors Opinion&quot;, or any past or recent medical
journals proving or disputing the &quot;phenomenon of
craving&quot; he speaks about in the opinion&quot;

<p>

Thanks,

<p>

Matt

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Matt,
<p>
Thanks for the question, and thanks for the compliments.
<p>
I don't really have a whole lot more information on Dr. Silkworth than you have
available to you.

<p>
I feel funny about Silkworth. It seems like he was sort of the man in the middle.
I half agree with Silkworth's idea that alcoholics are &quot;allergic&quot; to alcohol,
but don't think that it is an allergy. It might just be a toxic reaction,
or the body's rebellion against any more acetaldehyde poisoning.
(Acetaldehyde is the breakdown product of ethyl alcohol, and acetaldehyde is toxic.
It's what gives you those god-awful hangovers.)

<p>
I've had such reactions to alcohol myself. Just the first sip of a beer for the day and
suddenly I had a horrendous splitting headache and was shaking, and had to slam three
beers fast just to kill the pain. The pain didn't let up, but at least getting
drunk minimized the pain. But I don't think that's an allergy; just some
kind of temporary toxic reaction.
I had many, many other occasions where I didn't have any such reaction to
even a whole pitcher of good microbrew.

<p>
I feel like Silkworth allowed himself to be used for publicity
purposes by Bill Wilson, and Wilson didn't hesistate to exaggerate
Silkworth's reputation and &quot;discoveries&quot;, in order to put a facade of
medicine on Alcoholics Anonymous, and to try to claim that A.A. had something new.
<p>
Bill Wilson often tried to assert that
<a href="orange-letters39.html#disease_theory">Silkworth originated the disease
theory of alcoholism</a>,
which isn't even vaguely true. The disease idea dates all the
way back to Dr. Benjamin Rush in 1784.
<p>
The wording of &quot;alcoholism is an allergy combined with a disease&quot;
does seem to have originated with Silkworth, though.

<p>
I have a lot of problems with Silkworth's &quot;craving&quot; idea, though.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the action of alcohol
on these chronic alcoholics is a manifestation of an allergy; that the
phenomenon of craving is limited to this class and never occurs in the average
temperate drinker.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, Dr. William Silkworth,
page XXVI.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is loopy self-referential logic. If someone really craves alcohol and drinks it to
excess, then he is labeled an alcoholic. If someone doesn't crave alcohol
and drink to excess, then he isn't an alcoholic.
So of course only members of the &quot;class of alcoholics&quot;
display such &quot;craving&quot;.

<p>
Silkworth didn't even mention people with obsessive-compulsive disorders.
A lot of what I see that passes for &quot;craving&quot; is really signs of some kind of
obsessive-compulsive mental disorder. In fact, mental problems are one of the
biggest underlying causes of excessive alcohol consumption.
<p>
But Silkworth just glossed over the mental issues by saying that
alcoholics were &quot;drinking to overcome a craving beyond their mental control&quot;.
<p>
He stated that some alcoholics were &quot;psychopaths who are emotionally unstable&quot;,
and he said that there was a &quot;manic-depressive type&quot;,
and then there were &quot;normal&quot; alcoholics,
but that was the extent of Silkworth's analysis of the minds of alcoholics.
Silkworth's knowledge of psychiatry was basically non-existent, and at times, he said so.

<p>
Silkworth was sort of on the right track when he talked about how a little
drinking would rekindle the craving.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
All these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they cannot start
drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving. This phenomenon,
as we have suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy which
differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct entity.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, Dr. William Silkworth,
page XXVIII.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

But such reawakening of intense desires isn't restricted to alcoholics.
I get the same reaction from smoking a cigarette after having quit for a while,
and so do lots of other smokers or ex-smokers. Just one cigarette,
and I'm hooked again. So, if I want to stay off of cigarettes, I can't smoke
even just one.
<p>
Likewise, I have an ex-junkie friend
who cannot touch opiates at all, not even just a few pain pills that
his doctor gives him, or it reawakens the dragon and he's in trouble.
<p>
I think that just shows that once you get addicted to something,
you will always be hyper-sensitive to it, and
it is terribly easy to get readdicted.
<p>
I don't think that makes ex-addicts a separate class of humans.

<p>
But Bill Wilson did. Bill, who loved to rave about
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">how bad alcoholics really are</a>,
went further:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal as his mind.
It did not satisfy us to be told that we could not control our drinking
just because we were maladjusted to life, that we were in full flight
from reality, or were outright mental defectives. These things were true
to some extent, in fact, to a considerable extent with some of us.
But we are sure that our bodies were sickened as well.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page XXIV.</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And of course I don't believe that joining a cult religion and getting 
a big &quot;psychic change&quot; is the answer to alcoholism.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Matt,

The name misspelling is no big deal. I knew what you meant.
Karen Silkwood is a famous name too (for a very different reason, of course).

From:  	&quot;Pamela&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Interesting website<br>

<p>

Hello &#8212;

<p>

I've been reading your website over the last few days and I have found
it very interesting.  I am a 38 year old woman, and I have been sober
since 1986.  I have also been a member of AA since 1986.  My sobriety,
up until recently, I assumed was because of being a member of AA.  I
have recently been challenged by my therapist to stop going to AA.  So,
partially because I don't trust my own thinking (thank you AA), I have
been consulting your site for validation and information.

<p>

What's weird is that I realize I have never even thought about not going
to AA for all of these years.  I'm know along the way, people have asked
me if I still need to go, why I am going, etc.  But honestly, I never
even thought about it until now.  I haven't gone to a meeting for over a
week (which isn't long but I big change), and the last meeting I went
to was absolutely unbearable.  Now that I have opened my mind to even
considering that AA is not for me, it feels like the program, and the
people in the program, is strangling me.

<p>

However, there is also overwhelming fear of not going anymore and a huge
social void.  And I can point to a million AA reasons and responses that
are likely triggering my feelings.  In some ways, I think I am
&quot;addicted&quot; to AA if that makes any sense.  My goal right now is to give
myself some time away from the program and allow myself to &quot;withdraw&quot;
from the toxic people that are part of my life.  Lucky for me, I haven't
really been such a &quot;good AA&quot; and I have a very active social life and
network that are not related to the program.

<p>

The one thing that I have been struggling with more than anything, is
actually questioning if I am even an alcoholic at all.  I was 18 when I
stopped drinking, and while my drinking and drug use was certainly
unhealthy, I really don't know if I think I am an alcoholic.  All along,
I have told myself the typical program stuff, &quot;relate to the feelings,
not the situations&quot;, if we don't quit it'll be &quot;jails, institutions or
death&quot; and so on, and I just bought into the whole thing and stopped
questioning it.  My therapist is a little bit out there the other way,
she doesn't think there is such a thing as an alcoholic.

<p>

So, I could go on and on, but I won't.  Thanks for putting the
information out there.  It has definitely helped me to think about some
things, and at least opened my eyes to some things I need to look at.
For myself and on my own.  Possibly for the first time in my life.

<p>

Pamela

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Pamela,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And congratulations on your 20 years of sobriety.

<p>
And yes, it sounds like you are ready to get on with your life.

<p>
The idea that you are addicted to A.A. makes perfect sense.
That is what happens. You get habituated to it and don't quite know how
to live without it.

<p>
And you are right about A.A. strangling you. The aim of A.A. is to control
your life. They say it is for your own good. I disagree.

<p>
I have to disagree with your therapist about there being no such
thing as an alcoholic &#8212; I know that I'm one, and I just can't drink
alcohol.
(But that's okay, because there are other things to do in life.)

<p>
The biggest thing that I would worry about in your quitting A.A. is just
replacing that part of your social life. You can start slowly,
gradually getting more involved
in no-alcohol social events here and there, enlarging your
circle of non-alcoholic friends and acquaintances,
replacing A.A. meetings with something else, one by one.
You don't have to make a big life
change and quit A.A. cold turkey. Do it gradually so that there is no
freaking out... unless, that is, you really feel that you've gotten to
the point where you can't stand another A.A. meeting.

<p>
I am reminded of another letter where that question came up before.

From:  	&quot;Howard W.&quot; 

<p>

Dear Orange:
<p>
You made some remarks in letters that I wish to respond to.
I think that a large part of drinking is dual diagnosis.  I was told that
dual diagnosis is &quot;tough&quot;.  Well, in substance abuse treatment, I expect it
would be.

<p>

People frequently drink to deal with emotional/affective problems.  If those
issues are effectively addressed, the alcohol abuse is as well.

<p>

It is possible, for many, to drink safely again.   But, the safe dosage of
alcohol is low.  For a man, no more than 12 servings per week.  For a woman,
no more than 9 servings per week.  Alcohol abuse does cause physical
disease.
<p>
For many, the issue is moot.  Many simply do not wish to take the risk.

<p>

Howard

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Howard,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I agree with what you are saying, and have said pretty much the same thing
often. Some of the doctors I was reading on a now-defunct mailing list considered
<i>all</i> cases of addiction to be dual-diagnosis cases. They felt that
when someone was so compulsively consuming alcohol or drugs that they
were destroying their health, that they had some underlying psychiatric or
other medical disorder. But of course.
<p>
The only cautionary note that I have to add is,
&quot;While it is possible for many to drink safely again, it is also possible,
for the many others, for drinking again to be a personal disaster.&quot;
Remember that
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1">
the famous Rand Corporation think-tank study on alcoholism</a>
found that half of the successful people who had stopped drinking self-destructively
did it by tapering off into moderate, controlled drinking,
and the other half by total abstinence.

<p>
Dr. Kenneth Blum, who discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcoholism, and perhaps also to a
tendency towards drug addiction, believes that genetic alcoholics simply cannot
drink at all. (See
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS">his interview in 
James Christopher's book on SOS</a>.)
Other kinds of alcoholics can learn to moderate.

<p>
I happen to be one of those genetic alcoholics
who cannot drink again. I know, I did the experiment
and learned the hard way, many years ago.
It only took 3 beers to destroy 3 years of sobriety.
I was readdicted instantly.

<p>
Some people, like me, have a problem where, if one beer is okay, two is even better
and three is really okay. And then, why stop there? Three is just a tease.
You need more than three to get where you really want to be...
<p>
When I drink, I want to astral-plane. I want it to be like LSD.
I want to fly.
I can drink until I pass out and I'm still not quite there. Almost, but not quite.
So I'll keep drinking as long as the supply lasts and I can stay awake.

<p>
The only working answer for me is just don't drink any alcohol at all. That works great
and is surprisingly easy. I find that I hardly even miss it. And I sure don't miss
the hang-overs, the sickness, the brain damage and memory loss and cloudy-headedness...
And the feeling that my life is falling apart.
And the doctor telling me that I'm going to die. No, I don't need that.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
Actually, I had little trouble with AA and the true believers in AA.
First, I went a distance &#8212; about 20 miles to a noon meeting.  They were
mostly women; no men bragging/complaining about how &quot;bad&quot; they were.

<p>
Second, I protected my anonimity as much as I could.  I phoned no one.

<p>
Third, my personal situation was unique; and, to be frank, quite unpleasant.
Unpleasant for me to live through; and, unpleasant for them to hear.  I
was not &quot;kind&quot; to them &#8212; my honesty was merciless.

<p>
Some even seemed to understand that I was going to be all right  &#8212; by
implication, without AA.

<p>
So, AA did me no harm.
I realized that I was not going make a life in AA.  If I stayed in AA, I
would remain a dead man walking.

<p>
I do consider AA to be useless as &quot;treatment&quot;.  AA seems to revel in self
abnegation and self humiliation.  The emotional blackmail is really quite
primitive.

<p>
But that is mitigated.  Many attendees are mandated; by court order;
employer order; or, treatment center order.  These folks may be close to a
majority.
It appears to me that many are keeping a low profile; saying little or
saying the normal cliches.  They are just putting the time in.

<p>
Many old timers are like that as well.  Some seem to regard AA as a kind of
talisman to ward off &quot;the drink&quot;
Plus, many old timers do not really say anything about their lives or
problems.  Much of what they say consist of AA cliches.  I think that some
use these cliches because it is safe.

<p>
I think that AA is therapeutically useless; and in that sense, it is worse
than a cult.

<p>
&quot;very interesting; but, stupid&quot;

<p>

Hello &#8212;

<p>

I have a web site on the internet, the domain space for which I paid, as
an atheistic Hepper (Hepatitis C [HCV] ) who also happens to be a Adult
Child of Alcoholics (ACoA). I was doing a search for an essay I read
previously by someone who professed that his &quot;higher power&quot; is the Laws
of Nature and I came across your site... which made me take another look
at my multi-problem &#8212; Atheist, mature woman, and Hepper. I did not read
every word of
<a href="orange-heresy.html"><i>The Heresies of the 12 Steps</i></a>
so I'm
not sure of your religious beliefs or if you have any. However, what I
did read confirmed what I thought of the two ACoA meetings I attended in
1998; the higher power thingy. Also during those two meetings, I
realized that even though all of the attendees had the common
donominator of an alcoholic parent, that's where our similarities stopped.

<p>

Consequently, I've been in therapy several times.

<p>

I'm now giving myself psycho-babble via a personal web page, trying to
get back my love of life since learning that I have HCV and remembering
how I got it in 1965. I hope you don't mind but I've linked to your url
on my blog/journal/whatever on my web site,<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160319204011/http://www.atheistswithhcv.com/">
http://www.atheistswithhcv.com/</a>
<p>
If you do not wish me to link to your
site, please let me know. Because my site is so new, as of yet, none of
the search engines have indexed any of the meta tags, so even if you
don't wish to be linked from my site, it won't matter cause no one is
viewing it (other than commercial internet sites and a couple of
friends) at this time.

Hi Donnie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I don't have any problem with you linking to
me, and in fact, when this letter goes into the letters section of my web site,
there will be a link from my web site to yours too.
<p>
And you know, in a way, my religious beliefs don't matter. What I believe in
most of all is the truth. I am far more interested in finding and publishing
the truth than in parrotting anybody's package of religious dogma.

<p>
For more on ACOA, check out the
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html">snake oil</a>&quot; web page.
<p>
Good luck on your hep C battle. I got infected way back when, too.
It's just so easy to do.
I wrote a bit about that

Have a good day.

Oh, I love it!

<p>

Sorry to hear you have HCV too. Seems I've had it for more than forty
years. My lil' pet dragon moved in on me, riding on two blood units
because I almost bled to death during a still birth. In 1965, anyone
could walk off the street and sell his blood for $5 a pint. I didn't
care at the time; after all, the stuff saved my life. So what did I do?
I paid society back by becoming a regular blood donor for years and
years, hopefully saving others' lives... the way mine was saved. I
stopped giving in 1989 because I got busted for not weighing the minimum
requirement. Oh yeah! I figure I've given at least sixty people
Hepatitis C.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Bummer.
</font>
<p>

What's galling is that for years I've smugly gone about telling
everyone, &quot;I'm the healthiest person I know&quot; ... because except for HCV,
I was. The symptoms began around 2000, but I thought they were just age
related. Silly me. Oh, the ex husband (of 26 years) and my two grown
children are all negative.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Did you treat? I have not and currently have no desire to do so. I'm
more concerned with the quality of life rather than the quantity at this
age. Treatment, from what I understand from those who have treated, is
usually worse than the disease. We won't talk about the cost, although I
have good medical insurance. Plus, half the time, it doesn't work. Those
odds just aren't good enough for me. According to the biopsy, I'm Grade
2, Stage 1 and &quot;my&quot; medical team in Houston said I'd probably stay that
way for a long time to come. I have geno 2b which, also according to the
team, is THE genotype to have if I'm going to have hepc. My last check
up was in February and the blood work results are still in the normal
range.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Donnie,
<p>
I got no treatment. I was never sick, and never had any signs or symptoms,
and never dreamed that I had been infected. I lucked out big time, and
my immune system spontaneously defeated the germ without my even knowing it.
And that all happened like 35 years ago.
<p>
The only reason I ever found out is because one doctor insisted on testing me for
everything as part of my million-mile overhaul (the over-50 physical).
<p>
That is verified. I got tested repeatedly, with more and more sensitive tests,
including viral loads. While a sick friend was scoring 2 million viruses per
milliliter of blood, I scored &quot;under 200&quot;.
I felt guilty, because of how good I felt while I watched him suffer and look like an
escapee from Auschwitz (because of the interferon). I mean, he was a decent guy and
didn't deserve what was happening to him.

<p>
Then, when they wanted to use
me as a volunteer in a research project to see why people like me don't get sick,
they gave me another, even more sensitive, PCR test and I
scored &quot;under 80&quot;. In other words, zero, but they can't measure zero, so they
just declare the limits of resolution of the test.
One doctor looked at the results of the test, and shrugged his shoulders, and said,
&quot;You don't have it.&quot;
<p>
But I've got lots of the anti-bodies, zillions of them,
just hanging around, waiting, ready to kill any of those nasty Hep C germs that dare to come near.
<p>
My liver enzyme tests are all normal, too. Amazingly, even after 20 years of alcoholism
and 35 years of Hep C, my liver is in great shape.
Some people just have all of the luck, don't they?
I will never again grumble about how unfair it is that I can't win the Powerball lottery.

<p>
(Like I said in
<a href="orange-letters42.html#HepC">that other letter</a>,
I won a game of Russian Roulette where a Colt 45 six-shooter
was loaded with 5 bullets. I still managed to catch the empty chamber,
and come through unharmed.)

Anyway, thanks for responding to my email. Your site is humongous and

about the book. If you read that entry, you'll see that I wrote Ms. Woititz a
letter in care of her publisher, telling her she was doing what everyone
does and that is to lump everyone into neat, little, manageable slots. I
haven't received an answer and probably won't.

<p>

Actually, I blame my psychotic, alcoholic mother and my ex husband
for my contracting HCV, because neither of them physically cared for me
when I was helpless and ill. Lately, I've been wishing I'd gotten HCV
through using drugs. At least I would've had some enjoyment getting
stoned while the dragon entered.

Date:  	Sat, April 1, 2006 10:46<br>
From:  	&quot;Kelli B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Is it hopeless?<br>

<p>

I have been search the internet and reading your site, but while I find
others with the same problem, I can't find an answer...

<p>

My boyfriend of two years has been totally absorbed by AA. Nine months ago
he started, and I was thrilled! (I didn't know what AA was, just that it was
some magical cure for drinking) He was great when he was sober, but hateful
and cruel when drinking. I was ready to leave him so when he went to AA I
thought all my problems were solved. How wrong I was!

<p>

So he goes to aa. Stops drinking. We (me and my children) never see him. He's
never home, he's at meetings, or preparing for meetings, or cleaning up after
meetings, or he's working or sleeping. That's it. That becomes his whole life.

<p>

We fight about his sudden constant absence from the family.  He is adamant that I
go to alanon. So I go, expecting to find INFORMATION or help of some
tangible kind. I find instead a small group of religious older women, who
manage to eat up an hour and not talk about ANYTHING. They recite a bunch of
stuff from the book, and then someone tells their story. That's it.

<p>

That didn't help me!!! From what I could see, this group of women just
accepted that their husbands were never going to be home, and replaced them
with a group of old women. Their literature suggested that &quot;anything is
better than him drinking&quot; and &quot;keep the house perfect, the kids quiet and
take care with your appearance so he wont have an excuse to drink&quot;.

<p>

They also think they are powerless over alcohol. WELL. I am not powerless
over ANYTHING as long as I have two feet and a heart beat. If he hadnt quit
drinking I was leaving. How is that powerless?? I have LOTS of power over
alcohol!

<p>

I cant buy into their crap. I try a few meetings, it's all the same, Lords
Prayer at the end, holding hands, &quot;Keep coming back , it works it works it
works&quot;.  So I just let him do his AA thing, and I take up all the slack at
home. I do everything now, me and the kids. He comes and goes as he
pleases... this goes on for months. I am not happy, kids are unhappy, there
are still fights, about money, about normal household stuff two parents
disagree about. But we cant have a conversation, he cant handle any stress.

<p>

Gradually he's sucked more and more into the theology of aa...

<p>

We were happily rational atheists when we moved in together two years ago,
now he kneels at the foot of the bed to PRAY for people who annoy them.

<p>

I fight a constant inner battle to remember the man he WAS versus this
stupid sheep he has become.

<p>

He gets counselling (sponsoring) from some old man... but it's really just
sitting and swapping stories and reminders to PRAY for people.  I begged him
to get REAL counselling, but he claims only other AAs can help him.

<p>

I tried to talk to his new AA friends, i begged them for help, but they all
told me &quot;you need a program, you need to talk about how you feel with people
who understand&quot;, they blamed it on &quot;early recovery&quot; and how in the beginning
it's ALL about HIM. They claim he can't have a balance of program and home
because program is everything.

<p>

I wanted him to get better, I didn't want him to die from his drinking, and
he would have. But this... this is not living. He has no life that's not
related to THEM. He is never home, does NOTHING around the house or with me
and the kids, and I cant have a conversation with him that doesnt end with
him trying to 'step' me with the serenity prayer.
<i>I. Don't. Believe. In. God.</i>
He cant accept that.  He ignores all his old friends, and has pretty
much cut off his family.

<p>
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
He still has problems with his health, with depression, terrible anger
problems, and he gets only AA help, which encourages him to get off his
anti-depressants because they are drugs.

<p>

Two weeks ago we separated. He is living with an aa member now, and claims
he wants to work things out, come back home. But he can't spend an evening
here without going to a meeting!!

<p>

Is there ANY way to get him back? The man I fell in love with, the one who
was so smart and funny and great when he was sober?

<p>

Is he gone forever?

<p>

I want my old boyfriend back, but I cant wait forever. I have to make a
decision soon because I can't pay the bills here alone.

<p>

Should I just tell him to come home, move back in and just go do his thing?
Will he come out of this? Do they ever 'level out' and find some kind of
balance?

<p>

Thanks for reading this, I know you must get lots of mail. I just dont know
who else to talk to. I dont have anyone in my life with ANY experience with
AA at all. And god FORBID you say anything against it to any of the fans.

<p>

Sadly,

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello K,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
What you are describing is just so classic. It's a big part of why I keep on
doing this web site. A.A. really hurts a lot of people &#8212; probably far more than
it helps.
<p>
The sponsor telling your boyfriend not to take his medications is downright
criminal &#8212; that sponsor is practicing medicine without a license,
countermanding the prescription of a real doctor.
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications">A.A. is notorious for doing that</a>.

<p>
And them telling you that you need to
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Al_Anon">go to Al-Anon</a>
is just crazy.
Obviously, you do not need to join a cult religion just because you know an
alcoholic.

<p>
Unfortunately, I can't predict the future. I'm no good at it at all.
My crystal ball is cracked and dry rot got my ouija board.
<p>
In the most general of terms, we can talk about odds. Most people eventually
tire of the 12-Step dance and drop out of Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">95% of them
in the first year</a>, and more after that.
But at the same time, a few true believers become 20-year old-timers.

<p>
Everything you have said about your friend tells me that he has major
mental problems &#8212; some kind of obsessive disorder. First he tried to fix
himself by drinking alcohol, but that doesn't work because alcohol is poisonous,
so then a doctor put him on tranquilizers, and now he has become
totally obsessed with a cult religion. He needs professional help.
And the doctor might want to give him another medication, like an SSRI.

<p>
The fact that he wants to come back to you and try to patch up the relationship
is a hopeful sign. I would absolutely insist, as a condition of him coming back,
that he see a real doctor, preferably a psychiatrist, and probably also a 
counselor whom the psychiatrist might recommend. Do not for a minute accept
the rap about how A.A. is all that he needs. A.A's 12-Step quackery is the last
thing that he needs.
<p>
You didn't say whether he is the father of your children. That matters.
He will be more likely to come around and get it together if they are his
kids.
Otherwise, well, you have already noticed that he is more on a desperate quest for
his own happiness than for yours or the children's.
<p>
(Isn't it funny how A.A. condemns selfishness when an alcoholic pursues a
drink with dogged determination, and then praises selfishness when it is
in pursuit of &quot;my sobriety&quot;?
<i>&quot;This is a selfish program.&quot;</i>)

<p>
I haven't found any good web sites that specifically give advice for a situation
like yours. When I did an internet search, most of the found web sites
just jumped on the alcoholism word and recommended that he be put into a treatment
program. &#8212; Which is totally inappropriate here, especially when most treatment
programs for alcoholism are based on the 12 Steps and don't work at all.

<p>
When redoing the search without any mention of alcoholism, just looking for a
doctor for a compulsive-obsessive mental disorder, I got a few promising hits:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160319204011/http://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/index.htm">
http://www.medicinenet.com/obsessive_compulsive_disorder_ocd/index.htm</a>
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160319204011/http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/000929.html">
http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/000929.html</a> &#8212; Dr. Koop on obsessive-compulsive disorder

</ul>


<p>
I would try calling the local city or country mental health office, and ask them
how you can find a doctor or psychiatrist who is appropriate for this situation.
I would start off emphasizing the words &quot;obsessive mental disorder&quot;, and leave
the alcoholism word for later, so that they don't do the same thing as the internet
search does, and just recommend standard alcoholism treatment.


<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

Thank you so much for your reply. Its a great comfort just to know that
someone understands.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Kelli,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks.
</font>
<p>

Sadly I have gone the route you suggested, I went to doctors visits with
him, and they put him on antidepressants, which didn't work because the
alcohol interfered with them. I accompanied him to a psychiatrist, and we
have been to counselling. Our doctor, the psychiatrist and the counsellor
ALL think AA is the best thing ever.(Its also a small town, we have already
tapped pretty much every resource) The counsellor encouraged him to 'find a
balance', but he cant. You put it well when you called it a &quot;desperate quest
for his own happiness&quot;. Thats pretty much it in a nutshell.  Nothing else
matters except that warm fuzzy feeling he gets from his next hit, I mean
MEETING.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I think I know where my situation is headed, there's not much else to try,
especially if he doesn't see the problem. I have to take care of myself, and
my children now (not his). If I had only known, I never would have supported
him going to that first meeting. Even his mother asked him if he would ever
&quot;have a life again&quot;. I have one hope left, and that's the anger management
counselling I insisted he take before I would consider a reconciliation.....
I guess I roll the dice and home someone talks some sense into him, because
he listens to EVERYONE and ANYONE but me.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that is the problem, isn't it? In his mind, only members of A.A. are valid sources
of information. Nobody else knows anything. (That is a universal cult problem.)
</font>
<p>

Is there any chance you could hook up with someone like Michael Moore and do
an expose movie and get your message out to a bigger public?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that would be fun. I understand that Penn and Teller did an episode of their
show (&quot;Bullshit&quot;, I think), Season 2, Episode 11, that skewered Alcoholics Anonymous.
I haven't been able to find or download or see a copy of it yet.

And South Park did a great spoof of A.A. &#8212;
<a href="orange-letters30.html#South_Park">see this</a>.
So the message is getting out, little by little.

Subject:  	Hello!<br>

<p>

Hi there!

<p>

I'm Debbie, BIG fan, and thank you!

<p>

I am totally sober, FINALLY and without AA!!!!!!!!  AA left me drinking and
farther and farther into self hatred and feelings of being a failure.  No AA
for me = I am alive.

<p>

Anyhow I am writing to see if you might be able to point me to, or put out a
blurb.  I'm looking for some NON-aa recovery stories of women.

<p>

I have a site
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160319204011/http://www.reachingupforair.com/">
http://www.reachingupforair.com</a>

<p>

I don't disclude anything that anyone uses, hell, I finally got the point
that what ever works if it needs working.

<p>

But.... I'm getting a TON of stories, but all are AA OA NA and on.  I know
you don't endorse a lot and that's cool.

<p>

I've sent many other women like me your way.  Esp. when that say &quot;I've tried
AA and I just don't get it.  Their right, I'm hopeless&quot;  Bull!

<p>

Anyway, it never hurts to ask.

<p>

Thanks for your site!!!!  I am free and living my life, moving forward and
not living a drunkalog day after day after day!

<p>

Debbie

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Debbie,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. I'll put this letter up on my web site,
and anyone who wants to send you a story can.
<p>
Have a good day, and good luck with your project.

Hi A,
<p>
Very interesting web page, enjoyed looking it over. My compliments on
your effort.
<p>
Self-editing is sometimes doesn't deliver a very polished product.
Might suggest letting someone look it over for you and reducing the
number of rhetorical questions. Otherwise, nicely done.

Hi Jerry,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. And yes, sometimes I could use an editor.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Mairtin O M.&quot; 

<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>
how are you doing? I'm very well. I've enjoyed reading your latest batch
of letters. Especially the one by Berman the fat guy. Seems to me it is
he who probably has a &quot;angry bloated face&quot;. Another good example of
the 'spiritual program' in action!
<p>
Anyway the main reason I write to you is to tell you about an online
book I found called <i>Cult Survivor, How to Live In The Material World
Again</i>
 by Nori J Muster.

You can find it somewhere here
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160319204011/http://surrealist.org/writing/handbook.html">
http://surrealist.org/writing/handbook.html</a>


<p>
She has a
chapter on the Steps, but rather than condemn it she suggests it can
help! She claims it can relieve guilt! And her analysis on the Steps is
crazy. She advices us to make contributions to AA! Really you've got to
see this!
<p>
Regards<br>
Mairtin

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Mairtin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. It's good to hear from you again, and I am well, and
I hope you are too.

<p>
That thing about Nori Muster is really interesting, because I have quoted Nori
Muster at length before, because
she wrote one of the best books about being
inside of the Hari Krishna cult for 10 years &#8212;
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Nori_Muster">
<i>Betrayal of the Spirit: My Life behind the Headlines of
the Hare Krishna Movement</i></a>.
<p>
Alas, it sounds like she still doesn't understand what the essence of a cult really is.
She's happily walking right into another one.
<p>
And what do you want to bet? I suspect that what she likes about A.A. is
very similar to what she liked about the Hari Krishnas...
<p>
Yes, I will just have to get ahold of that book and read it.

<p>
Have a good day.

PS:
Ah, wait, I found it.  And I see all kinds of big red warning flags already.
On the introduction page we read:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;One book that brought me solice after my cult experience was
<i>A Course In Miracles</i>. ACIM teaches that reality is neutral.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I have written about ACIM before,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#CIM">here</a>.
I consider it just another hocus-pocus fraud.
The authoress of ACIM claims to be channeling Jesus Christ and
writing down His dictation. Yeh, right.

<p>
I hate to think it, but it seems like some people just stumble from one
cult to another, primarily because they don't change what they want.
If you are eager to buy into cultish airy-fairy beliefs, there will always
be a con artist around who is eager to sell some to you.
<p>
I'll read Nori Muster's whole book later.

To A. Orange

<p>
I came across your web-site and found it most interesting.  I am a reovered
alcoholic and found the twelve steps most useful.  Your page picks apart
Bill Wilson very well, I have no problem with that.  The fact is that he
helped millions do what they couldn't do by themselves.  I think your idea
with the smoking was ignorant.  At the time the book was written tabacco was
considered a deadly problem.  Hell women smoked when they were pregnant at
that time.  Cocaine was put in Coca-Cola.  Anyway if AA is a cult what
alternative to Alcoholism do you offer I did not see that on your page.  If
you're not part of the solution then you are feeding the problem.

<p>
God Bless

<p>
Jason

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jason,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I pretty much disagree with everything that you wrote,
of course.
<p>
Taking it line by line, let's see...
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I found the twelve steps most useful...&quot;
</font>
<p>
Most useful for what?

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Your page picks apart
Bill Wilson very well, I have no problem with that.  The fact is that he
helped millions do what they couldn't do by themselves.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Helped how many to do what? First off, the most members that the A.A. headquarters
in New York claims is 2 million, worldwide, and nowhere near all of them actually
get or stay sober, and most of them
will eventually drop out of A.A....
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">Look here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">here</a>.
<p>
Bill sure didn't help them to quit drinking, because
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">the A.A. members relapsed left and right</a>,
and still do.
<p>
In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">the A.A. failure rate</a>
is that same as the failure rate
of bunches of alcoholics who just quit on their own with no help.
That fact comes from a doctor who is a member of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous (World) Services, Inc., who spent the better part of
20 years shoving A.A. on his alcoholic patients and trying to prove that
A.A. works. It didn't, and it doesn't.
So Bill and his cult didn't help anybody to do anything.

<p><li>
<a name="Bills_tobacco"> </a>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I think your idea
with the smoking was ignorant.  At the time the book was written tabacco was
considered a deadly problem.  Hell women smoked when they were pregnant at
that time.  Cocaine was put in Coca-Cola.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Well gee, I guess God must have been really stupid in the 1930s, right?
God couldn't figure out that tobacco was a killer and tell Bill to stop it,
while God was talking to Bill in Step 11 and telling him everything else?
(Including dictating the <i>Big Book</i> to Bill, rumor has it...)
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">Lois Wilson could figure out how bad
tobacco was, and could nag Bill Wilson about smoking</a>,
but God couldn't figure it out?
It would take God another 30 or 40 years to learn from the U.S. Surgeon General
that smoking is unhealthy? Why didn't God just listen to Lois Wilson?

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Anyway if AA is a cult what
alternative to Alcoholism do you offer I did not see that on your page.&quot;
</font>

<p>
You seem to be unaware of the illogic of that sentence.<br>
Why do I have to offer an alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous? (Regardless of whether
A.A. is a cult...)
<p>
Do I have to offer an alternative to witch burning and the Spanish Inquisition
if I criticize those things? Why not? Do you want a bunch of witches and heretics running
around here? What's wrong with you?

<p>
When I say that Alcoholics Anonymous is a harmful cult, I do not have to
offer an alternative.<br>
What do you want, a less harmful cult? A less dishonest cult?
One that doesn't lie about its success rate so much?

<p>
Nevertheless,
I have pointed people towards alternative groups and methods and techniques
many many times:<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters43.html#alt_list">Look here for a quicky list</a>.<br>
<li> <a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works">Look here for a different list</a>.<br>
<li> <a href="orange-links.html">Look here for a longer list</a>.<br>
</ul>

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you're not part of the solution then you are feeding the problem.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Spoken like a true cultist. That is the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or"><i>Either/Or</i> propaganda technique</a> &#8212;
try to reduce the argument to only two choices, and try to force your opponent to
choose between them.

<p>
I can, of course, toss that same line back at you:
<i>&quot;If you won't join in the fight
to get rid of harmful dishonest predatory cults that only pretend to offer recovery and
health and self-development, then you are part of the problem.&quot;</i>
</ol>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
