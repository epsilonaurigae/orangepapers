<h2>THE DRUG WAR: Will there be a ceasefire during our lifetime?</h2>

<p>
Donald MacPherson is currently the Director of the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition, a
national coalition of organizations and individuals working to improve Canada's drug
policies.  Donald is involved in drug policy work at local, national and
international levels.  Formerly he was North America's first Drug Policy Coordinator
at the City of Vancouver, where he worked for 22 years.  He is the author of
Vancouver's ground-breaking Four Pillars Drug Strategy, which called for new
approaches to drug problems based on public health principles and the appropriate
regulation of all psychoactive substances.  In 2007 he received the Kaiser
Foundation National Award of Excellence in Public Policy in Canada.  In 2009 he was
awarded the Richard Dennis Drug Peace Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field
of Drug Policy Reform by the Drug Policy Alliance in the United States and the City
of Vancouver was awarded the Canadian Urban Institutes Secure City Award for the
Four Pillars Drug Strategy.  MacPherson is currently Adjunct Professor in the
Faculty of Health Sciences at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver Canada.
Ethan Nadelmann received his BA, JD, and PhD from Harvard, and a master's degree in
international relations from the London School of Economics.  He then taught
politics and public affairs at Princeton University from 1987 to 1994, where his
speaking and writings on drug policy &#8212; in publications ranging from Science and
Foreign Affairs to American Heritage and National Review &#8212; attracted international
attention.  He authored Cops Across Borders, the first scholarly study of the
internationalization of U.S. criminal law enforcement, and co-authored another book
entitled Policing the Globe: Criminalization and Crime Control in International
Relations, published by Oxford University Press in 2006.  In 1994, Nadelmann founded
the Lindesmith Center, a drug policy institute created with the philanthropic
support of George Soros.  In 2000, the growing Center merged with another
organization to form the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for drug policies
grounded in science, compassion, health and human rights.  Described by Rolling
Stone as &quot;the point man&quot; for drug policy reform efforts, Ethan Nadelmann is widely
regarded as the most prominent proponent of drug policy reform.

Hi again, Peter,
<p>
That sounds very interesting. Alas, I'm too far away from Toronto to just pop over there for the evening.
<p>
You know, the word &quot;war&quot; is a dead give-away of something. People who wax enthusiastic about anything
described as a &quot;war&quot; are dangerous people.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	What worked for me<br>

<p>
Thank you for the Orange Papers.   I've seen them a couple of times over
the years I've been sober (coming up on year 12 this summer) and usually
felt threatened when I did.  I went to AA constantly my first few years of
being sober and much of what I saw in the OP I considered angry, nasty,
insulting,  all that stuff you've likely seen in every pro-AA letter you
receive.
<p>
What pissed me off the most was that you backed up your arguments... in
detail.  So while I could be pissed at you,  I couldn't argue back.<br>
Bastard!!
<p>
Anyhoo... AA worked for me, in the beginning.   Possibly in spite of the
program rather than because of it.   What worked was having an available
group of people who shared my love of and my problems with getting
obliterated on booze.   Hanging out with guys who tried to stop but simply
couldn't did help me... empathy really worked.
<p>
But the Steps themselves felt so contrived, the slogans so repetitive like
a mantra.  It IS a religion,  but they don't do that very well really.  I
now get my spiritual food (and everything else) elsewhere.
<p>
Having folks around in a similar predicament was attractive and kept me out
of immediate danger at the beginning.   I don't get into the whys and
wherefores,  is it a disease, is abstinence the only way.   I'm happier now
than when I was getting obliterated 4-5 times a week... so, I don't do it.
<p>
&quot;KEEP IT SIMPLE&quot;, right?  Do I WANT to?  Sure sometimes.  I wouldn't be
much of an alcoholic if I didn't.  I'm also a grown man and I'm capable of
deciding whether or not I'm going go out to buy a case of beer and a bottle
of Bushmill to chase old feelings.  I don't buy the &quot;insanity before the
first drink&quot; thing.   At least not anymore.  It's an excuse which does
nothing but coddle to a person who won't take responsibility for their own
actions.
<p>
Keel on trucking!  And thanks for your anger!

Hello Thomas,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story and the compliments. I agree about the comfort and encouragement that you can
get from a group of other people who are also recovering. That's one of the good things that the other
recovery groups, like SMART, SOS, and WFS, also have going for them. I prefer them because they
do not push nonsense like the stuff that you mentioned &#8212; &quot;powerless&quot;, &quot;insane&quot;,
&quot;diseased&quot;, must &quot;work the Steps&quot;...

From:  	CW<br>
Subject:  	My 37th AA anniversary<br>

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
It has been years since I last visited your incredible site.  It's  still
incredible.

<p>
I celebrated my 37th year of continuous sobriety in AA today by chairing a
Sunday morning meeting at my home group.  My wife of 35 years will
celebrate her 37 years later this month.  In the group this morning  were two PhDs,
four Master's degrees, six lawyers with prestigious  firms, a clinical
psychologist, the CEO of a large company, an ex-Marine drill  sergeant, a
project manager for a major firm, a software developer with 4,600  customers, a
lovely former Broadway actress, a college professor, two truck  drivers, three
school teachers, five workers for non-profit helping  agencies and a host
of other men and women with spouses, families, jobs,  friends galore, active
social lives.

<p>
They are white, black, Hispanic, Oriental.  They are married or  divorced
or single or widowed, as young as 19, as old as 86.  The average  length of
sobriety is 15 years, ranging from 30 days to 45 years.  All  these people
share sobriety, perfectly clear thought processes, and the same  problems
anyone faces in an uncertain world.  In short, they are  America.  To suggest
that these intelligent, witty, funny, capable  people have been brainwashed by
a sinister cult with various insidious  hidden agendas is simply laughable.

<p>
We have long been aware of the sexual proclivities of our  founder, Bill
Wilson, and we do not excuse or condone it nor do we cover it up  or minimize
it.  We are fully aware that, in large gatherings  of alcoholics with such
checkered pasts as ours, there will be  sexual opportunists (both male and
female), con men, shysters, and the  mentally ill, amateur doctors who give
inappropriate medical advice, and  religious zealots that want to inject
specific religious doctrines and ideas  into AA meetings.  The very size of AA
makes it all the more susceptible to  these misfits, and some groups do a
better job of weeding them out than  others  But to suggest that AA is a
&quot;breeding ground&quot; for perverts, quacks  and religious fanatics is simply nonsense.

<p>
For every &quot;study&quot; that shows AA to have a low recovery rate, there are
countervailing studies conducted by legitimate researchers (such as NIAAA) that
show very high recovery rates.  For example, a 1992 NIAAA nationwide
survey  found that members of AA who stayed in the program had a 64% abstinence
rate, and 37% of those who attended AA but dropped out maintained their
sobriety.  A 2008 research project on AA sobriety exposed the many
methodological flaws of the negative surveys (including one by AA itself) and  found
that AA's actual recovery rate came close to its initial claims:  75%  to 93%
sobriety.

<p>
One reason for these huge discrepancies is the failure of researchers to
survey AAs who actually give the program a persistent effort over a long
period of time (a longitudinal study).  Like any other study of treatment  for
a medical condition, the respondent must be participating fully in the
treatment to qualify for measurement.  It is useless and distorting to  include
casual attendees and dropouts in the survey population (although AA
dropouts have a surprisingly high abstinence rate).  AA promises sobriety  only to
those who &quot;thoroughly follow our path.&quot;  No one would include  diabetics or
heart patients who did not follow the treatment regimen in any  study of the
effectiveness of treatment.  Researchers who measure AA's  effectiveness by
the number of &quot;attendees&quot; miss the boat almost entirely.

<p>
Nor is it fair to suggest, as some who post here do, that because they did
not &quot;like&quot; some aspects of AA and dropped out that AA has &quot;failed.&quot;  No one
likes chemotherapy either, but it often works.  So does AA, like it or
not.

<p>
Finally, one wonders what fierce obsession drives &quot;A. Orange&quot; to invest
hundreds of hours in maintaining a web site devoted entirely to savaging
Alcoholics Anonymous.  No one who pages through the reams  of vitriol,
distortions and outright lies would not immediately  suspect that a very disturbed
individual is running the anti-AA show.  In  our group, we routinely laugh
about A. Orange, but unfortunately, the naive, the  easily fooled, and the
ignorant are not found in AA.  They are found on A.  Orange's weird rant.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello CW,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations to you and your wife for your many
years of keeping yourselves sober.
<p>
Obviously, you really believe in A.A. and you allow your beliefs to color your
vision of A.A.
<p>
<ol>

<p><li>
You began by declaring how many years of sobriety you have in A.A. That is the
standard A.A. oldtimers' introduction.  They say that
<font color="black">&quot;No one is entitled to speak for A.A., but I have a
zillion years sober, and I say that...&quot;</font>
He establishes his credentials in A.A. by giving his count of years sober, 
and then he spends the next ten minutes speaking for A.A. while claiming that no one is entitled to
speak for A.A.
<p>
I have that bait-and-switch trick list in the file:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#speak" target="_blank">The Bait and Switch Con Game</a>

<p><li>
The bragging about all of the members that you have, Ph.D.s and
Masters, and lawyers, and drill sergeant, and actress and truck driver, etc.,
is standard PR boilerplate. Nothing has changed since
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group</a>,
who used exactly the same speech to brag about his groups, and that's where A.A.
got it from.
<p>
And you can also get the same speech from Scientology and lots of other cults.
Exactly the same speech.

<p><li>
Likewise, the boasting about white, black, Hispanic, Oriental,  married, divorced
young, old, is also just standard boilerplate PR. Frank Buchman also said the same stuff.
He just loved to brag about his token Africans, and token Indians (both kinds,
Native Americans and India Indians), and other races.
Nothing has changed in 77 years.

<p><li>
Then you did the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Minimization and Denial</i></a>
dance about sexual exploitation in A.A., trying to dismiss
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">the Founder Bill Wilson's sexual behavior</a>
as old hat:
<font color="#9F0000"><i>&quot;If we have known about it for a long time, then it doesn't matter, right?&quot;</i></font>
Heck, doesn't every church have a corrupt fake holy man as a founder?
What does it matter?
<p>
And you said,
<font color="black">&quot;But to suggest that AA is a
&quot;breeding ground&quot; for perverts, quacks  and religious fanatics is simply nonsense.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Sorry, but the problem is big and getting bigger. Entire subcults of A.A. are devoted to sexual exploitation
of newcomers, like Mike Quinones' Midtown Group, and all of Clancy Imusland's many groups. Check out these files:
<p>
<ol type="A">
<li> <a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html" target="_blank">Stories of the Midtown Group of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>
<li> <a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Stories about Clancy Imusland's <i>Pacific Group.</i> And the Atlantic Group, Foxhall Group, Badger Group, and Nursery...</a>
</ol>
<p>
And the most damning fact is that the A.A. headquarters refuses to do anything to
fix the problem. It's just like the Catholic Church going into denial and hiding
sexual exploitation of boys by priests for more than a century, and refusing to
fix the problem.

<p><li>
Likewise, you did the 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Minimization and Denial</i></a>
tap-dance some more over
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">the issue of telling sick people not to take their medications</a>.

<p>
The big problem there is that A.A. has no way to get rid of the criminals and the creeps.
On the contrary, A.A. collects them.
An A.A. sponsor can kill somebody with bad advice like telling him not to take his medications, or
driving him to suicide,  and they won't kick the bad sponsor out of A.A. And if the members of one
group are actually so socially conscious as to shun and ostracize the monster, and &quot;bad-vibe&quot; him
out of the meeting, he just goes to other meetings. And since everybody is anonymous, he can even
be &quot;Tom&quot; at one meeting, and &quot;Dick&quot; at another, and &quot;Harry&quot; at another.
A.A. meetings are a criminal's dream come true.
<p>
The A.A. headquarters absolutely refuses to clean house. They hide behind the
rubrik that &quot;Every group is independent.&quot;
And nobody warns little Suzie, who got caught driving home from a party buzzed,
that the previous person whom the judge sentenced to A.A. meetings is a serial rapist.
<p>
And A.A. does nothing to stop the judge from sending the worst criminals in the city to A.A. for baby-sitting.
In fact, they encourage it:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters55.html#AA_cooperation" target="_blank">Look here</a> for quotes from the official literature.
<p><li>
Here is the official A.A. statement on using courts to get people sentenced to A.A. meetings:<br>

http://www.aa.org/en_pdfs/mg-05_coopwithcourt.pdf</a>
</ul>

 
<p><li>
Then you made some sweeping deceptive statements backed up by little or no evidence, coupled with 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Lying With Qualifiers</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

countervailing studies conducted by legitimate researchers (such as NIAAA) that
show very high recovery rates.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What studies? Please be very specific. I want links, titles, authors' names, dates, publication names,
exact references, preferably with page numbers, and Internet URLs, if possible,
so that I can go look those things up and see what was really said. I give all
that information in my references, and I expect the same thing back in good arguments.


<p>

<p>
The deceptive qualifier is &quot;who stayed in the program&quot;.
What percentage of the newcomers were driven out by
the cult religion and 13th-Stepping sponsors, and sponsors telling people not to take their medications?
How about 95%?
<p>
Trying to claim the sobriety of people who left A.A. and did it their own way is fraud. Heck, I'm one of
the people who dropped out of A.A. and stayed sober. I have over 12 years sober now, and A.A. is not due the
credit for that.
<p>
In fact, the 37% who stayed sober without A.A. are a measure of <i>spontaneous remission</i>. Those are the
people who recover without any &quot;help&quot;, or &quot;support group&quot;, or &quot;treatment&quot;.
A.A. routinely tries to steal the credit for those people, like in this example.

<p>
And again, you are making a vague reference. Exactly which 1992 study? Where was it published?
What is the author's name? What is his ax to grind?
How accurate are his numbers? How did he get his numbers? Those things matter a lot.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A 2008 research project on AA sobriety exposed the many
methodological flaws of the negative surveys (including one by AA itself) and  found
that AA's actual recovery rate came close to its initial claims:  75%  to 93%
sobriety.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, no links, no references, no publication name, no way to check what was really said. Or who said it.
Or whether the author was just another publicity shill for the 12-Step treatment industry.

<p>
I can give you a good reference for the opposite conclusion:
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank"><i>The International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i> refuted the Humphreys-Moos study</a> that supposedly showed that A.A. was just as good as CBT.
The Humphreys-Moos study was faked, fraudulent, and loaded with errors and deceptions.
And you can read the full text of the article at that link.
<p>
Now <i>that</i> is a reference.


<p><li>
Then you claimed:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One reason for these huge discrepancies is the failure of researchers to
survey AAs who actually give the program a persistent effort over a long
period of time (a longitudinal study).  Like any other study of treatment  for
a medical condition, the respondent must be participating fully in the
treatment to qualify for measurement.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You have a partial point there, but only a partial point. Dr. George E. Vaillant,
who just loves A.A., and who went on to become a member of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., tested alcoholics in A.A. for 8 years,
trying to prove that A.A. works.
<b>Isn't 8 years long enough? Isn't a Trustee of A.A. good enough?</b>
<p>
And the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients, after 8 years, was:
5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking. You can read the whole story here:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a><br>
While trying to prove that A.A. works, Dr. Vaillant accidentally proved that A.A. kills. No way of
treating alcohol abuse produced a higher death rate than did Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Over in England, Doctors Orford and Edwards did a year-long test of A.A., the biggest and longest test of
A.A. in Great Britain, ever, and the results were that a full year of A.A.-based treatment
was no better than just having a doctor talk to an alcoholic for just one hour, telling him to quit
drinking or he would die.
You can read all about it here:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Orford</a><br>

<p>
By &quot;participate fully&quot;, you mean join the cult religion, believe in Higher Power,
sell your soul to the group, do the occult practices in the 12 Steps,
parrot untrue slogans and dogma,
and spend the rest of your life going to A.A. meetings and seeking new recruits.
That is an awful lot like
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">selling your soul to the Devil in trade for sobriety</a>.

<p>
But you have a point that it is sometimes unfair to judge A.A. on the basis of
people who only attend a few meetings.  However, I have a point when I say that
anything that is so offensive and repugnant that it drives people away after only
a few meetings is not a good treatment for the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;.
That won't help people.
<p>
If a medicine has such bad side effects, and is so distasteful, that the patients
refuse to take it, then a good doctor will find another medicine.  A group that
drives the majority of the people away after just a few meetings is not a helpful
group that will get people sober.  America needs something better than that.

<p><li>
You declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA promises sobriety  only to those who &quot;thoroughly follow our path.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, you have to devote your life to A.A. That is too high of a price for sobriety for most people to pay.
<p>
It is true that if someone totally devotes his or her life to A.A., and does its wierd occult practices every day,
and believes in Higher Power, and <b><i>always goes to an A.A. meeting instead of drinking alcohol</i></b>, then
that person won't drink alcohol. But only a few cult joiners are willing to sacrifice their lives like that.
<p>
Furthermore, you are glossing over all of the problems with people who stay in A.A., like:
<p>
<ol type="A">
<li> <a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">An increased suicide rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">An increased divorce rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">An elevated death rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">An elevated binge drinking rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">An increased arrest rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Increased costs of hospitalization</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers" target="_blank">Disturbed Members, Mentally Ill Followers.</a>
</ol>
Those are not the results of a good treatment program.


<p><li>
Then, as is so typical of A.A. true believers, you just had to finish your letter with
an <i>Ad Hominem</i> attack. Why is it that Steppers just always have to do that?
It's just the standard A.A. way to end a letter:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Finally, one wonders what fierce obsession drives &quot;A. Orange&quot; to invest
hundreds of hours in maintaining a web site devoted entirely to savaging
Alcoholics Anonymous. No one who pages through the reams of vitriol,
distortions and outright lies would not immediately suspect that a very disturbed
individual is running the anti-AA show. In our group, we routinely laugh
about A. Orange, but unfortunately, the naive, the easily fooled, and the
ignorant are not found in AA. They are found on A. Orange's weird rant.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And you finished with complaining about &quot;A. Orange's weird rant&quot;.
Wow, you <i>almost</i> made it to the end of the letter maintaining a sane and
reasonable-sounding tone, but you broke down at the last minute. So it goes.
<p>
Now, to answer your question, the answer is simple: I've seen too many good people
hurt by A.A. misinformation and lies, and I want to get the truth out there for all to see.
<p>
By the way, you accused me of printing &quot;outright lies&quot;. I don't do that.
I am very careful to make sure that everything I say is true. And if anything is wrong,
I will fix it.  (Unlike the A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, where Bill Wilson's errors and lies are <i>never</i> fixed.)  
Would you care to
tell me about some of the &quot;lies&quot; that you claim I have printed?
Please say what page you saw it on, and give an exact quote of my &quot;lie&quot;,
and then give your refuting evidence, complete with all reference information like
author, publication, date, page number, or URL. And of course your refuting
information must be better than my supporting evidence.
Then we shall see what the truth is.
</ol>

<p>
Last, but not least, you say that you have 37 years in Alcoholics Anonymous. Wonderful.
And you were talking about the A.A. sobriety rates in your remarks. Good.
Then you are certainly qualified to answer these questions that no Stepper has ever answered honestly:
<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Or even several years later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No qualifiers are allowed, like, &quot;We will only count the people who <i>worked the program right</i>, or
we will only count the people who <i>really tried</i>, and <i>kept coming back</i>.&quot;
Everybody counts. No exceptions.
<p>
No excuses are allowed. When the doctor gives a patient penicillin, and it fails to cure the infection,
the doctor doesn't get to say, <i>&quot;But he didn't work the program right. He didn't pray enough.
He didn't surrender. He held something back in his Fifth Step.&quot;</i>
No excuses.
<p>
So what's the actual A.A. cure rate?

Hi there Mr. Orange,

<p>
Thank you so kindly for the comment on my article 'One Step Forward &#8212; 
Twelve Steps Back' on Healthy Place.

<p>
<font color="blue">

<p>
It's an article I have wanted to write for about ten years, but I guess
feared the retribution.  The kind of retribution I assume you feel on a
daily basis! haha  Your Orange Papers are remarkable and have done a great
deal in bringing down the powers that be of AA.

<p>
I work in a treatment centre, and often hear of clients talking about the
Orange Papers and I have also read most of it myself.

<p>
I have wanted to write a book about AA for a long time.  I'm under the
working title 'Beyond the Veil of Anonymity: A Critical Analysis of
Alcoholics Anonymous.'  I was in fact in the group for about four years, on
and off, in both NA and AA, so I speak from not only a clinical perspective
but also a personal one.

<p>
Anyway, just wanted to say hi and thank you for reading.  It would be nice
to talk sometime as we share extremely similar views.

<p>
Take care,

<p>
Chris

Hello Chris,

Thank you for the letter and all of the compliments. I really didn't know that the Orange Papers were

Hello Mr Orange:

Someone in my AA group told me about this page, and I am NOT sorry to say that you

Hello Sandra,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Actually, yes, I'm an alcoholic who has 12 years of sobriety now,
and I'm very happy about the fact that I stay sober without A.A.
<p>
And congratulations on your sober time. You are doing it, you know. Nobody is doing it for you.
Nobody holds your hand every Saturday night but you.

Since you didn't know whether I'm an alcoholic, you obviously haven't read much of my web site, or

Subject:  	Re: AA<br>

<p>
May I ask if you are an alcoholic? If so, are you an active alcoholic?
because that would explain your misjudgement on your %'s about the many
people that have recovered through the fellowship of AA. Not only does it
help keep you sober, it sorts your mind out in ways we never thought
possible. Our thinking becomes clear, and we learn how to grow again. We
meet friends there. And I never thought I could go anywhere and have a good
time without booze. I have tried other ways to quit, but AA does work, if
you have the dire need or want to quit. Have a good day.

<p>
Respectfully

<p>
Sandra

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Sandra,
<p>
If by &quot;active alcoholic&quot;, you mean that I'm drinking alcohol, the answer
is, &quot;No, as I said before, I have 12 years of sobriety now.&quot;
And I do. I even have 12 years off of cigarettes and all other drugs too.
And I'm very happy about it. I feel so much better. I feel like I escaped from Hell.

<p>
Unfortunately, A.A. does not keep people sober or clarify their minds. What you
are describing is the combination of the euphoria of your body recovering from
alcohol poisoning &#8212; the &quot;Pink Cloud&quot; effect &#8212; and the process
of the 12 Steps warping your mind as the brainwashing takes effect. The 12 Steps
are really brainwashing, you know. Or maybe you don't know. You should go look at
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">
the description of brainwashing as described by Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, Prof.
Margaret Thaler Singer, and Dr. Edgar H. Schein,
here</a>.
Those doctors studied the victims of Chinese Communist brainwashing of American
prisoners of war during the Korean War, and they described the mechanics of how
it works. The similarity of their descriptions of brainwashing, and the A.A. 12-Step
program, is stunning. A.A. does all eight of the things that Dr. Lifton called
the essential conditions for brainwashing.
<p>
The actual effects of staying in A.A. and &quot;Working The Program&quot; are:
<p>
<ol type="A">
<li> <a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">An increased suicide rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">An increased divorce rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">An elevated death rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">An elevated binge drinking rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">An increased arrest rate</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Increased costs of hospitalization</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers">Disturbed Members, Mentally Ill Followers.</a>
</ol>

<p>
I understand your remark,
<font color="black"> &quot;And I never thought I could go anywhere and have a good
time without booze.&quot;</font>
Yes, that is how addiction keeps a hold on you. It makes you think
that your drug of choice is essential for happy living. Please read about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>
for a full description of how the craving center of your brain will constantly tell you
that you need a drink or a drug or a cigarette, or life just isn't worth living. And
how it says that, &quot;Just one will be okay,&quot; and encourages you to relapse.

<p>
Happily, both of us have learned that it ain't necessarily so. That enlightenment is not
due to doing the occult practices of an old cult religion,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">which is what the 12 Steps are</a>.
(Please click on that link and read about the history of the 12 Steps.)
<p>
A.A. does not work. They are lying to you when they say that A.A. works great, and
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;RARELY have
we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path&quot;</font>,
and all of that.

and

<p>
Should you decide that you want to explore some other recovery groups who won't mess with
your mind like that, and who have something more than an old pro-Nazi cult religion, see:<br>

And again, congratulations on your year of sobriety, and happy birthday. The first year is the 
hardest. After that, it gets easier.

<p>
Good luck with your life now.

Hello Marcus,
<p>
Oh yeh, not uncommon at all. Thanks for the link. I didn't know about Ripoff Report
until now. I have a few items of my own to give them. Nothing as big as this though.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Orange,

<p>
I don't know if it affects the performance of your site, but three of the
Zip file links are broken.

<p>
Thank you for what must be thousands of hours of work that you have put
into this amazing site.

<p>
I now believe that my sobriety was spontaneous remission. I am 15 years
sober and consider myself recovered.

<p>
I no longer attend AA meetings since I was assaulted on October 10, 2011.
(My case against the man who assaulted me has finally gone to the State
Attorney after 17 months.) AA stopped being a safe haven after that event,
and after I finally realized that I was using AA as a spiritual bypass and
saw AA for what it truly is &#8212; a cult.

Hello Don,
<p>
Thank you very much for the bug report. It's fixed. The dates on the files
were wrong by a couple of days. If you reload the first page, i.e. menu1.html
or index.html, you will see slightly different dates for those files,
and you can download them now.

<p>
And welcome to freedom.<br>
And thanks for the compliments.<br>
Have a good day now.<br>

Doug sent you a message.

<p>
&quot;Hey, Orange.  For a little while now I've been reading you and have also spent some
time on orangepapers.  I just read your post on wildlife.  I was hoping you could
suggest for me some books on logic and propaganda.  Anything else you could suggest
would be appreciated.  Thank you.<br>
Doug &quot;

Hello Doug,
<p>
Thanks for the question. Oh, that is actually a tough question. Some of the stuff I learned so
long ago that I don't remember where I got it. I think I learned about some Greek teaching deductive
and inductive reasoning back in high school...
<p>
There are a few good books on propaganda techniques and logical fallacies and the
workings of the mind listed in the bibliography, here:
(Clicking on the name of the book will take you to the book's description in the bibliography.)
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Coughlin_speeches" target="_blank"> 
<i>The Fine Art of Propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's Speeches</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Institute for Propaganda Analysis; editted by
Alfred McClung Lee and Elizabeth Briant Lee</a>
<br>
Father Coughlin was the inventor of hate talk radio way back in the nineteen-thirties.
He was the original Rush Limbaugh. Coughlin only used eight
propaganda tricks in his speeches and rants, but he used them constantly.

<p><li>

If you click on the title of a book, it will take you to the bibliography where you will see a description
of the book. The description will give you a good indication of how helpful the book was.
 Some books were much more interesting than others, some contained more relevant information
than others, and some are great classics in their field.  

<p>
And on the Internet, there are several good web sites that list and explain logical fallacies:
