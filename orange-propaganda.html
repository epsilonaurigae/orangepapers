In his <i>Rhetoric</i>, Aristotle acknowledges that it would be better if
we could make our case without either browbeating or flattering the
audience; nothing should matter except &quot;the bare facts.&quot; Yet he
laments, &quot;other things affect the result considerably, owing to the
defects of our hearers.&quot;<br>

&quot;I soon realized that the correct use of propaganda is a true art which
has remained practically unknown to the bourgeois parties. Only the
Christian-Social movement, especially in Lueger's time, achieved a
certain virtuosity on this instrument, to which it owed many of its
successes.&quot;<br>
&#8212; Adolf Hitler, <i>Mein Kampf</i>, Volume 1, Chapter 6, &quot;War Propaganda&quot;
<p><br>
&quot;Through clever and constant application
of propaganda, people can be made to see
paradise as hell, and also the other way
round, to consider the most wretched sort
of life as paradise.&quot;<br>
&#8212;  Adolf Hitler

<p><br>

&quot;Propaganda,&quot; Goebbels once wrote, &quot;has absolutely nothing to do with truth.&quot;

<p><br>
&quot;In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.&quot;<br>
&#8212; George Orwell
<p><br>
&quot;This election is not about issues,&quot; Rick Davis, John McCain's
campaign manager said this week. &quot;This election is about a
composite view of what people take away from these candidates.&quot;
That's a scary thought. For the takeaway is so often base, a
reflection more of people's fears and insecurities than of our
hopes and dreams.<br>

As you read the following pages, you will be exposed to quite a
variety of deceptive propaganda techniques, logical fallacies,
and lies (hopefully, none of them mine).
You might as well learn a little about how the art and science
of propaganda
works, so that you can recognize the techniques as people try to fool your
mind with them.
<p>
You probably already know a lot about this,
whether you realize it or not, because
politicians pull many of these standard stunts on you every election year, and
you have grown immune to some of them. And modern advertising
uses a lot of them, too, and you just tune them out.
Nevertheless, let's just do a quick over-view of propaganda techniques.
<p>
Bear in mind that &quot;propaganda&quot; is not inherently a dirty
word &#8212; it just usually is.
Any time you are trying to convince anyone of something, you are
using some kind of persuasion, debating, or propaganda technique.

Just telling the whole truth about something is one simple propaganda
technique, and a highly effective one.
But lying often works better, at least with some audiences...
<p>
Master these propaganda techniques, and you too will be able to
proselytize and promote cult religion and radical politics just
like a battle-hardened old-timer.

<b>PROPAGANDA TECHNIQUES:</b>

<p><br>
<a name="truth"> </a>
<li> <b>Tell The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth.</b><br>

This can be highly effective, and very convincing, if you know your subject
material well, and are a good speaker.
<p>
<i>... And <b>IF</b> the truth is really what you want your audience to hear and believe.</i>
<p>
The Truth, as a matter of habit, has some disadvantages: You have to learn and remember a
whole lot of facts, and keep them straight in your head.
The facts might not always be what you wish them to be.
And, alas, the truth is sometimes very boring...
<p>

<p><br>
<a name="lie"> </a>
<li> <b>Lie</b><br>

This one is simple, straight-forward, and obvious. Just lie and say whatever
you want to. It has the advantages that you don't need to memorize so many facts,
and you can make up new facts when the currently-existing ones don't suit your
purposes.
The disadvantages are that you might get caught in a lie, and that would destroy
your credibility.

This one is more subtle. It has the advantage that you can't get
caught in a lie, because everything that you say is true. You just
happily fail to mention all of those bothersome little facts that do not
support your point of view.
Should a critic point out one of those annoying undesired facts,
you can at least feign innocent ignorance, or claim that the fact
is really just an unimportant, trivial detail, not worth mentioning.

<p>
For example: In 1908,
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">the Lutheran minister
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a> got into a squabble over money with
the trustee committee of their hospice for young men in Philadelphia,
and in an angry huff, Buchman resigned and got on a boat for Europe. He ended
up at a large religious convention in Keswick, England, where he felt
that he had a spiritual transformation.
He felt moved to write letters of apology to all six of the trustees
with whom he had squabbled, humbly asking their forgiveness. Buchman
said that none of them even bothered to answer his letters.

<p>
That was rather unkind of them, wasn't it? No wonder Buchman had a
disagreement with them, if they were really so haughty and so inconsiderate
that they would not even acknowledge a man's humble apology and
request for forgiveness...

<p>
There is just one small detail that Frank Buchman left out in his telling
of that story:
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#return_address" target="_blank">
Buchman didn't put any return address on the envelopes</a>
that he mailed back to Philadelphia.

Vice President Dick Cheney told CNN on May 8, 2001, that nuclear energy
&quot;doesn't emit any carbon dioxide at all.&quot;

That is lying by omission. It is true that nuclear reactors do not create carbon dioxide
while burning their nuclear fuel, but the process of mining the uranium is done
by machines like bulldozers that create lots of carbon dioxide and air pollution as they
burn diesel fuel.
And so does the process of refining the ore and converting it into usable nuclear fuel,
and transporting it to the reactor. And then there is the problem of disposal of the
nuclear waste. That's another giant hole to be dug with diesel-powered machines.
If the whole fuel cycle is taken into account,
then nuclear power creates several times as much CO<font size="-1"><sub>2</sub></font>
as renewable energy sources.

<br>
Bill Wilson gave us lots of good examples of that technique. In chapter 8
of the <i>Big Book</i>, &quot;To Wives&quot;, the wives of the
recovering alcoholics seem to give advice to the wives of
other alcoholics:
<p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As wives of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to
feel that we understand as perhaps few can. We want to analyze

<p>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Sometimes there were other women. How heartbreaking was
this discovery; how cruel to be told that they understood our
men as we did not!<br></font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 8, <i>To Wives</i>, page 106.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We wives found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted with pride,
self-pity, vanity and all the things which go to make up the self-centered
person; and we were not above selfishness or dishonesty. As our husbands
began to apply spiritual principles in their lives, we began to see the
desirability of doing so too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first, some of us thought we did not need this help.
We thought, on the whole, we were pretty good women, capable of being
nicer if our husbands stopped drinking. But it was a silly idea that we
were too good to need God.
Now we try to put spiritual principles to work in every department
of our lives. &nbsp; ...
We urge you to try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to
your husband as the radically changed attitude toward him which
God will show you how to have. Go along with your husband if you
possibly can.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 8, <i>To Wives,</i> page 116.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, Bill Wilson really would like you to feel that the wives
understand as perhaps few can.
<p>
The big problem with those quotes is that the <i>To Wives</i> chapter
of the <i>Big Book</i> was not written by Lois
Wilson or any of the other wives of the alcoholics &#8212;
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#To_Wives" target="_blank">Bill Wilson wrote it all</a>.
Lois wanted to write it, but
Bill didn't trust his wife to say the right things,
or to get the &quot;style&quot; the way he wanted it, he said,
so he wrote the whole chapter himself, while pretending to be
his own wife.
<p>
What a huge difference that one tiny little fact makes.
That chapter reads entirely differently, it becomes a sick twisted joke,
when you know who the real author was.
<p>
Bill Wilson perceptively analyzed his wife's many mistakes for her,
and confessed all of Lois' sins for her (in print),
and honestly admitted her many failings:
her moral shortcomings and dishonesty and selfishness
and her silly thinking that she was too good to need God (page 116).
(She was &quot;selfish&quot; while she worked in Loesser's department store
to support his
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Lois_rem" target="_blank">
unemployed thieving philandering drunken ass</a> for years and years.)
<p>
Then Bill the housewife even lectured &quot;the other girls&quot; not to nag their
husbands about their drinking, or else those guys will
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#dont_nag" target="_blank">get mad and go sleep with their
mistresses</a> (page 111)...
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">Like Bill did.</a>


<p><br>
<a name="holding_nothing_back"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill Wilson gave us many more examples of that <i>Lie By Omission</i>
technique.
Here, he is talking about doing Step Five, where we confess all of
our sins and moral shortcomings to someone else:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This is perhaps difficult, especially discussing our defects
with another person. We think we have done well enough in
admitting these things to ourselves. There is doubt about that.
<font color="#9F0000">
In actual practice, we usually find a solitary self-appraisal
insufficient.
</font>
Many of us thought it necessary to go much further.
We will be more reconciled to discussing ourselves with another
person when we see good reasons why we should do so. The best
reason first:
<font color="#9F0000">
If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.</font>
Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to
themselves certain facts about their lives.
Trying to avoid this humbling experience, they have turned to
<font color="#9F0000">easier methods.</font>
Almost invariably they got drunk. Having persevered with the
rest of the program, they wondered why they fell.
<font color="#9F0000">We think the reason is</font>
that they never completed their housecleaning. They
took inventory all right, but hung on to some of the worst items
in stock.
They only thought they had lost their egoism and fear;
they only thought they had humbled themselves. But they had not
learned enough of humility, fearlessness and honesty,
<font color="#9F0000">in the sense we find it necessary</font>,
until they told someone else all
their life story.<br></font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, pages 72-73.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Wow. That's really impressive. I guess we had better
get down on our knees right now, and start confessing everything,
<i>holding nothing back!</i>
<p>
Right?
<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>Wrong.</b>
</font>
<p>
Notice that the rest of the logic is missing. That is,
where do we see the report on the other people,
<i>who did confess everything</i>,
and then successfully abstained from drinking?
There is no such report, because they all relapsed too.
The early New York group that Bill Wilson was writing about had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank">a very high relapse rate</a>.
Fully fifty percent of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">the original
<i>Big Book</i> authors relapsed</a> and
returned to a life of drinking.
In Akron, Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob calculated that they had only a 5% success rate
in sobering up alcoholics (which is the same as the success rate of people who quit on their own).
Bill Wilson couldn't keep 'em sober not for nuthin'.
The cult religion routine didn't work at all.

<p>
But Bill didn't want to talk about that, because he was a faithful
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">Buchmanite</a>
who believed that you must confess your sins to everyone
else in your group if you are to be holy. So Bill was doing everything
in his power to make everyone holy, even if it didn't make them sober.

<p>
And note how Bill also gave us illustrations of a few other propaganda
techniques:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#straw_man"><i>The Straw Man Tactic</i></a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We think we have done well enough in
admitting these things to ourselves.&quot;<br>
&quot;They only thought they had lost their egoism and fear;
they only thought they had humbled themselves. But they had
not learned enough of humility, fearlessness and honesty...&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Those people who think that they don't really need to do all
of Bill Wilson's wonderful 12 Steps are really stupid egotistical
dishonest cowards, aren't they?</i>
</font>
<p>
<li> <a href="#hide"><i>Hiding Behind Others</i></a>:<br>
The use of &quot;We&quot; to create the false impression that it
was more than just the opinion of Bill Wilson &#8212; that many
people had done a whole lot of research on the subject, and had
gained a lot of valuable experience in what really works to
keep people sober:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We think... We usually find...&quot;</i>
</font>
The truth is, when Bill wrote that paragraph in
December of 1938 and January of 1939,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank">there were only
60 or 70 sober A.A. members in the whole world</a>,
and they didn't all agree with him.
Their major experience was in watching Bill Wilson's religious program
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">fail to keep them sober</a>,
with most of the early A.A. members relapsing and leaving.
Here, Bill Wilson was really just pushing his own strange Buchmanite religious
beliefs, and trying to convince others that his ideas were the
only things that work.

<p>
<li> <i>Lying by Omission</i> (some more):<br>
Half of those few sober A.A. members didn't like or do Bill Wilson's
Twelve Steps.
They were the members who demanded that Bill's 12 religious steps
be called &quot;suggestions&quot;, not requirements, because they
saw clearly that Bill's dogmatic religiosity would drive away many
of the alcoholics whom the program was supposed to help. See page 59
of the <i>Big Book</i> &#8212; the steps are only <i>&quot;suggested as
a program of recovery&quot;</i>. But here,
Bill wants to fool you into thinking that all of the sober members
did Step Five thoroughly, holding nothing back, and that's why
they were sober.

<p>
<li> <a href="#post_hoc"><i>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc</i></a>:
&quot;<i>It happened after 'X', so it was caused by 'X'.</i>&quot;<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to themselves
certain facts about their lives.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Almost invariably they got drunk.&quot;<br></font>
Bill Wilson doesn't really give us any evidence that withholding
embarrassing personal secrets makes people drink alcohol,
just like he doesn't give us any evidence
that confessing sins to other A.A. members makes people get sober.
He just wants to fool us into
thinking it. I can with equal validity argue that they all relapsed
because they wore clothes to the meetings:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Time after time, we have seen newcomers make the stupid
mistake of wearing clothes to A.A. meetings.
<i>Almost all</i> of the newcomers who relapsed wore clothes.
(What sins and bodily imperfections were they trying to hide?)
Almost invariably, they got drunk.
And almost all of the people who wore clothes to A.A. meetings
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">eventually dropped out</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Conclusion: Obviously, wearing clothes to A.A. meetings causes
people to drink alcohol.

<i>&quot;If we skip this vital step, we
<font color="#9F0000">may not</font> overcome drinking.&quot;</i></font><br>
<p>
Then again, we might. <font color="blue">(I did.)</font><br>
Notice how Wilson lies to you obliquely, by hints
and suggestions, to lead you to an erroneous conclusion:
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;...we <b>may not</b> overcome drinking.&quot;
</font>

<p> And Wilson does it again, here:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;... they wondered why they fell. We think the reason is that they never
completed their housecleaning.&quot;<br></font>
&quot;<b>We think</b>&quot;?
It's hard to prove that Wilson is lying when he plants a suggestion like
that. He might actually think that all of that crazy stuff is really true.
<p>
And we can again use the clothes clause:<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;We think the reason that they relapsed is because they never
completed the task of taking off all of their clothes and fully exposing
themselves to the whole group.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<li> And who says that Step Five is a
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#vital_step" target="_blank">vital</a>&quot;</i> step?
Well, Bill Wilson does. That's assuming facts not in evidence,
assuming facts yet to be proven, the trick called
<a href="#petitio_principii"><i>petitio principii</i></a>.
We have absolutely no evidence, other than Bill Wilson's deceitful
declarations, that Step Five is in any way necessary, or even helpful,
for quitting drinking.

<p>
<li> <a href="#sarcasm">Sarcasm, Condescension, and Patronizing Attitudes</a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Trying to avoid this humbling experience, they have
turned to easier methods.&quot;<br></font>
If you won't do what Bill Wilson says, and humbly grovel before your sponsor and
confess all of your sins,
then you are just a weak, wimpy, unspiritual lazy bum who is guilty of seeking
<i>&quot;an easier, softer way.&quot;</i></b><br>
(<i>You couldn't possibly be seeking <b>a saner way</b> to recover.</i>)<br>
Real men are proud to masochistically grovel on their knees and wallow in guilt.

For another example of lying by omission, look closely at this text:
<p>
<blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Despite four decades of AA research, no clear picture has emerged as to
which patient characteristics can predict a positive outcome with AA
and, therefore, can be used as criteria for matching patients to AA. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#9F0000">
To date, only three randomized clinical trials have examined the efficacy of

The vast majority of AA studies, however, have focused on two narrower questions:
Which factors predict whether a person will join AA? And how does involvement
in AA predict outcome? In an attempt to answer these two questions, Emrick and
colleagues (1993) reviewed 107 previously published AA studies.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>

<ol>
<li>
The authors almost accurately stated that there have only been three good randomized
clinical trials of the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous treatment ever done.
(Actually, they ignored two of the best tests of all,
the very large test done by
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards in England</a>, and
also
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. George E. Vaillant's
clinical trial</a>, which also had merit.)
<li>
But the authors did not tell us what those three good clinical trials actually found.
They did not say one word about what Doctors Ditman, Brandsma and Walsh reported.
<li>
Instead, the authors
did a quick tap-dance towards &quot;the vast majority of A.A. studies&quot; that
were not properly done and are not scientifically or medically valid.
Then they cited a survey done by Emrick where he examined
107 of those less-reliable &quot;studies&quot;, essays, opinions, and
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">propaganda articles</a>.
</ol>
<p>
So what did those three valid clinical trails find? They found that Alcoholics
Anonymous was a disaster:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found</a> that
participation in A.A. <i>increased</i> the alcoholics' rate of
rearrest for public drunkeness.

<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma found</a> that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking.
After several months of indoctrination with A.A. 12-Step dogma,
the alcoholics in A.A. were doing <i>five times as much</i>
binge drinking as a control group that got no treatment at all,
and <i>nine times as much</i> binge drinking as another group that got Rational
Behavior Therapy.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Teaching people that they are alcoholics who are powerless over alcohol yields very
bad results. It becomes a self-fulfilling prediction &#8212; they relapse and binge drink as if
they really are powerless over alcohol.
</font>

<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">And Dr. Walsh found</a> that
the so-called &quot;free&quot; A.A. program
was actually very expensive &#8212; it messed up patients so that they required
longer periods of costly hospitalization later on.

<p>
<li> And the authors could have mentioned that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Doctors Edwards and Orford found</a>
that A.A. was completely ineffective, and that having a doctor talk
to the alcoholic for just one hour, telling him to quit drinking or else
he would likely die, worked just as well as a whole year of A.A. meetings.

<p>
<li> And the authors could have mentioned that Dr. George E. Vaillant, member of the
Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., found in
his 8-year-long test that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. was completely ineffective</a>,
and just raised the death rate in alcoholics. His A.A.-based treatment program had
the highest death rate of all of the treatment programs that he studied.

</ul>
<p>
But the authors mentioned none of that. They just started talking about matching
patients to A.A. without ever having established whether A.A. works or helps alcoholics
even a little bit,
or that we <i>even should</i> try to match alcoholics to Alcoholics Anonymous.
What is the point of sending patients to A.A. when it just makes them worse, and makes them
binge drink and die?

The Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was famous for this. He massively rewrote
Russian history. His agents actually went into libraries and cut pages out of
books, and replaced them with other pages that said what Stalin wanted the people
to read. People whom Stalin did not like and had killed &#8212; particularly other
old Communists who could compete with Stalin for leadership &#8212; were simply
erased from history.
They became &quot;non-persons&quot; (which was the official term for someone who
was erased from existence).
They supposedly had no part in the Revolution.
Their pictures were airbrushed out of historical photographs.
All records of their existence were erased.
They were never born. They simply never existed.

Bill Wilson taught hiding the truth as a standard recruiting trick.
In his history of Alcoholics Anonymous, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only
little by little. They simply did not want to get &quot;too good
too soon.&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank" target="_blank">
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts</a> &#8212; absolute
purity, absolute honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212;
were frequently too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed
with teaspoons rather than by buckets.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 74-75.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The alcoholics (<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#drunks" target="_blank" target="_blank">whom
Bill Wilson deprecatingly called &quot;drunks&quot; who didn't want
to be good</a>)
just wanted to quit drinking; they didn't want to
join Bill's crazy Buchmanite cult religion with its ridiculous Absolutes.
So Bill Wilson's answer to that problem was to deceive the newcomers,
and hide the intense religiosity of A.A., and to also hide
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">the Buchmanite Oxford Group cult
religion roots</a> of Alcoholics Anonymous, until after the newcomers had been
indoctrinated and brainwashed enough...
Mr. Wilson candidly admitted that he was practicing
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>,
not honestly telling the newcomers what membership in his group would really
entail.
And now, the A.A. slogan
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Teaspoons, Not Buckets&quot;</i>
</font>
teaches standard A.A. recruiting procedure.

<p>

The Alcoholics Anonymous shrine called &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;, that was
Bill Wilson's house in Bedford Hills, has been similarly cleansed of undesired
information and unwanted history. There used to be a &quot;spook room&quot;,
downstairs to the left, where Bill Wilson would conduct s&eacute;ances each day,
and play with a Ouija board and talk to ghosts and the spirits of dead people.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">Bill Wilson routinely practiced
necromancy and spirit-rapping and channeling of spirits</a>, and fancied himself
a skilled medium. The bookshelf in the room was
full of spiritual and occult books. All of that is gone. The room has been
&quot;refurbished&quot; to the point that nothing original is left, not even
the wallpaper. Now the room features new furniture and a clear plastic bookshelf
that contains only A.A. council-approved books (which are for sale in the bookstore).
All documents pertaining to Bill Wilson's &quot;spook sessions&quot; have been removed and
locked up in the sealed A.A. historical archives, where no one may see them.
<p>
For that matter, those historical archives are loaded with documents and history that you 
are not supposed to see (and probably never will see).
There are the early financial records where
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson stole the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund</a>
 and
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i></a>.
There are the letters where
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html" target="_blank">Clarence Snyder complained about Bill Wilson's financial dishonesty</a>.
There are accounts of
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's misbehavior, like philandering</a>
and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#loved_LSD" target="_blank">LSD consumption</a>.
There is so much interesting stuff in that archive that the leaders of A.A. will not
even release a list of what all is really in there.

2010-05-24: BP (British Petroleum) says that it &quot;will pay all legitimate claims
for damage&quot; from their immense oil spill. What is &quot;legitimate&quot;, and
who gets to decide which claims are &quot;legitimate&quot;?
Is BP really going to pay much at all? After the Exxon-Valdez ran aground and
dumped its load, Exxon delayed payments for the Prince William Sound disaster for
20 years and then got the Supreme Court to reduce the payments to nearly nothing.

<p>
And then of course there is the recent example of the crazy Republican politician Rep. Todd Aiken
who ranted about &quot;legitimate rape&quot;,
and claimed that women wouldn't get pregnant from &quot;legitimate rape&quot;.
(I guess only insincere rape gets a girl pregnant.)

<p>
And A.A. gives us numerous examples:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It works, if you work it.&quot;<br>
&quot;It works, if you make it work.&quot;<br>
</font>
Yes, and

<p>
In <i>The Promises</i>, Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,

</blockquote>
<p>
So of course if we are not amazed, then we were not painstaking enough...

<p>
Another example: the A.A. faithful read this statement out loud
at the start of every A.A. meeting:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">

</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
3rd Edition, Chapter 5, &quot;How It Works&quot;, page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
How could Bill Wilson write such a line when A.A. had
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">a horrendously
high failure rate</a>?<br>
Simple: the A.A. program requires people to abstain from drinking alcohol,
so if they relapse and drink, then they aren't <b><i>&quot;thoroughly
following our path&quot;</i></b>, are they?<br>
<p>
With that qualifier, Bill Wilson could have written,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;<b><i>NEVER</i></b> have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly
followed our path&quot;</font>.<br>

<p>
For another example, in the Foreword to the Second Edition of the
<i>Big Book</i>, page XX, Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of alcoholics who came to A.A. <font color="#9F0000">and really tried</font>,
50% got sober at once
and remained that way; 25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the
remainder, those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.
Other thousands came to a few A.A. meetings and at first decided
they didn't want the program. But great numbers of these &#8212; about
two out of three &#8212; began to return as time passed.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The impression we get is that A.A. worked great, and sobered
up 75% of the alcoholics pretty fast, and that all of the
alcoholics benefited at least a little bit, if they just tried.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>
Later, Bill Wilson told the truth:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to take the bait.<br></font>

file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This quote gives us the impression that A.A. had about a one or two
percent recruiting success rate: <i>You have to &quot;cull over hundreds of
these drunks to get a handful to <i>take the bait</i>.&quot;</i>
But that &quot;handful&quot; is people who just
&quot;take the bait&quot; and join Bill's club.
How many of those gullible joiners actually stayed sober for a year or more?
<i>Even less</i>, for sure. So
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the real long-term A.A. success rate</a>
was <font color="blue"><b>under one percent</b></font>,
even by Bill Wilson's own reckoning.
<p>

So how do we reconcile the vastly different numbers in those two statements?
Easy. We use qualifiers:
<ul>
<li>
First off, Bill Wilson
began the first quote with a major qualifier about those alcoholics
<i>&quot;who came to A.A. and really tried&quot;</i>. If they
didn't join A.A., or
they didn't <i>&quot;really try&quot;</i>, then they weren't counted.
<p><li>
And who decided whether they had <i>really tried</i>?<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Well, Bill Wilson, of course.<br>
</font>
Heck, with that qualifier, Bill Wilson could make the numbers into
anything he wanted them to be.
<p>
<li>
The last qualifier counted only &quot;those who stayed on with A.A.&quot;,
so those who relapsed and left A.A. and didn't &quot;Keep Coming
Back&quot; didn't count either.
That conveniently eliminated all of the drop-outs, deaths, and failures from
the statistics. So there wasn't a single case
&quot;of those who stayed on&quot;
that didn't &quot;show improvement&quot; in the statistics
that Bill manufactured.
<p>
<li>
So we can have the reality that less than one percent of the
alcoholics were actually success stories, joining A.A., quitting
drinking and staying quit for many years, while,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">in the
<i>Big Book</i></a>,
after Bill Wilson prettied up the numbers with those qualifiers,
it looked like at least 50% of the alcoholics were eventually
getting sobered up by A.A. (75% of the two thirds who kept coming back).
</ul>
<p>
Cute, huh? Now that's lying with qualifiers.
<p>
(And it's also a fair example of
<a href="#statistics">lying with statistics</a>.)
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Keep Coming Back! It Works! (...If you work it...)&quot;</b>
</font>



<p><br>
<a name="statistics"> </a>
<li> <b>Lie With Statistics</b><br>

Speaking of which, there is the time-honored method of lying called <i>Statistics</i>.
<p>
Both Mark Twain and Desraeli said that there are three kinds of lies:
<ul>
<li> Little White Lies,
<li> Damned Lies,
<li> and Statistics.
</ul>
<p>

You can have all kinds of fun with statistics:
<ul>
<li> Ninety-nine percent of all of the people who ate carrots between 1800
and 1900 are dead, so carrots are obviously very hazardous to your health.
If you eat carrots long enough, you will certainly die.
<p>
<li> President Eisenhower expressed astonishment and alarm when he
was told that fully half of all Americans had below-average
intelligence.
<p>
<li> Likewise, fifty percent of all Americans have below-average income, or
savings, or beauty, or housing, or education.
It's no wonder why the politicians don't want to associate with all
of those stupid, ugly, poor people, but guess who elects the politicians?
If 80% of the stupid people, and 75% of the poor people, and 65% of the
ugly people voted for a politician, then 220% of the poor, stupid, ugly
people voted for the politician. No wonder that bozo got elected.
<p>
<li> Another good one: Statistically, men who have survived two heart
attacks almost never die from lung cancer or cirrhosis of the liver.
There is just something about having heart attacks that protects people
from death by cancer or cirrhosis.
So, after you have had two heart attacks, you can smoke and drink all
you want.
<p>
<li> Ninety-three percent of the people who use statistics in their
arguments just make them up, and the rest get the numbers wrong.
<p>
<li>
Fifty percent of all marriages end in divorce.<br>
If you think that's bad, consider that the other fifty percent end in death.

<p>
<li> If you don't buy a lottery ticket, then your chances of winning are zero.
If you do buy a ticket (Powerball), your chances of winning are only 0.00000002 &#8212;
1 in 50 million.
Both numbers are so close to zero that there is little point in your actually handing over
your two dollars and buying a ticket &#8212; you still aren't going to win.<br>
On the other hand, if you do buy a ticket, then your chances of
winning are infinitely higher than if you don't.

<p>
<li> Public service announcements on TV and radio declare:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;2 out of every 5 fatal automobile accidents was due to
drinking. 33% of the drivers involved in fatal accidents had been
drinking. 24% of the pedestrians involved in fatal accidents had been
drinking. Therefore, alcohol intoxication is a major cause of
automobile accidents,
and drunk driving must be dealt with harshly.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That logic sounds impressive, but it's completely wrong.
Consider the reverse logic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;3 out of every 5 fatal automobile accidents did not involve
drinking. 67% of the drivers involved in fatal accidents had not
been drinking. And 76% of the pedestrians involved in accidents had
not been drinking. Therefore, sobriety is undoubtedly the major
cause of fatal automobile accidents, and sober driving must be
outlawed immediately, and punished harshly.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<li> And we could really have fun, starting a big war with statements
like, &quot;Forty-five percent of the drivers in fatal automobile
accidents were women, therefore women shouldn't be allowed to drive.&quot;<br>
(But if we did that, then 100% of the accidents would be caused by men. So
men shouldn't be allowed to drive.)

<p>
<li> Some people often cite statistics like,
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;95% of all heroin
addicts smoked marijuana before they graduated to the hard stuff.
Therefore, marijuana is a gateway drug that leads to heroin.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is also false logic. Consider this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Further research has revealed that 99.8% of all
heroin addicts consumed the white drug called milk for years before
they graduated to the white powder called heroin. Therefore, giving
children milk at school turns them into heroin addicts.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Or:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;99% of all heroin addicts, cocaine addicts, amphetamine addicts,
and marijuana users drank alcohol before they graduated to the harder
stuff. Therefore alcohol is the universal gateway drug.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Actually, there is a lot of evidence
that alcohol really <i>IS</i> the universal gateway drug, but the
cigar-smoking, whisky-guzzling Senators and Congressmen in Washington
don't want to hear that. They never tolerate hearing something bad
about their own favorite drugs; they just want to hear bad stuff
about other people's favorite drugs &#8212; preferably other people who are poor,
a different color or subcultural type, and not registered to vote.)
<p>
<li> Another piece of propaganda on TV now says,<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<b>&quot;In roadside tests of reckless drivers after auto
accidents, one out of three drivers tested positive for marijuana. Marijuana:
It's more harmful than we thought.&quot;</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<ul>
<li> They fail to establish any connection between having smoked marijuana
some time in the previous 30 days (which is what the drug test detects) and driving
recklessly or being in an auto accident today.
They could just as well have tested for coffee, and then found that
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Coffee! It's more harmful than we thought.&quot;<br></i>
</font>

<p>
<li> <font color="#9F0000">
And more harmful than <i>who</i> thought?<br>
</font>
The anti-drug lunatics have been swearing that
marijuana produces instant insanity and addiction ever
since they made that <i>Reefer Madness</i> movie
back in the 'thirties. They have never said that marijuana
was harmless. So they are also using the
<a href="#suggestions">Sly Suggestions</a> propaganda technique, implying
that we thought it was less harmful than it really is.

<p>
<li> Also note that two thirds of those reckless drivers managed to get
into their accidents without any help from pot. Logically, we must conclude
that <i>NOT smoking</i> pot causes more reckless drivers to get into
auto accidents than smoking it.
<p>
<li> That propaganda also did not say that the
pot-smoking drivers actually caused any of the car accidents &#8212;
they were just involved in the accidents. For all we know, they
might have been hit from behind by drunk drivers.
<p>
<li> Which brings up,
<font color="#9F0000">
how many of the drivers involved in the accidents were drunk?</font><br>
They didn't tell us anything about that, did they?
Why weren't they saying,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcohol &#8212; it's more harmful than we thought&quot;</i></font>?<br>
The propagandists appear to be hiding all evidence of drunk driving
(<a href="#lie_omission"><i>lying by omission</i></a>)
and just trying to blame all of the auto accidents on marijuana. But we know from
other propaganda, especially that disseminated by <i><b>Mothers Against
Drunk Driving</b></i>, that alcohol is the major cause of fatal auto
accidents. (But that's a different TV commercial.)

<p>
<li> One of the factors that really biases such a test is the fact that traces of
marijuana will linger in body fat for up to a month, while the evidence of
any use of alcohol, speed, cocaine, or heroin disappears within a day or two.
That can make it look like there is a lot more pot smoking going on than there really is,
while it fails to detect the chronic abuse of other drugs.
<p>
<li> Speaking of which, they didn't even say that they tested for those
other drugs, did they? They only told us that they tested for marijuana.
What else were the drivers on?
</ul>
<p>
Obviously, such propaganda is not designed to tell anyone the truth about drugs.
It is just more lying politics as usual.
</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="accusations_of_lying"> </a>
<li> <b>Scream Accusations of Lies and Lying</b><br>
This is just the opposite of telling a lot of lies: When your opponent tells some unpleasant truths
that you don't want to hear, scream accusations of lies and lying. Dismiss everything he
says as a lie, no matter how true it is.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous members use this technique often. Whenever they are presented with really
undesired facts, like the fact that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. Trustee and Harvard Professor Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>
found from eight years of testing A.A. as a treatment for alcoholism, that A.A.
was completely ineffective and just produced an appalling death rate,
<a href="orange-letters90.html#agent_green" target="_blank">A.A. defenders simply complain that that is a lie</a>.


<p><br>
<a name="observational"> </a>
<li> <b>Observational Selection</b><br>

Observational selection, also known as &quot;cherry-picking&quot;,
is a tactic like counting the hits and forgetting the misses. See
only what you wish to see. Overlook and ignore evidence you don't
wish to see. And encourage your audience to be equally blind.
Observational selection will destroy the validity of any
statistical study.

<p>
The classic example of this is: Something very unusual happens, and it turns out that
a tabloid &quot;psychic&quot; predicted it. So the &quot;psychic&quot; must be the real
thing, able to see the future, right? Wrong. It turns out that
the self-proclaimed &quot;psychic&quot; made many
hundreds of screwy, off-beat &quot;predictions&quot;, and just by chance, one
of them came true. The &quot;psychic&quot; just doesn't
bother to tell you about all of the wrong guesses that didn't come true...
Fans of Nostradamus still do this for him.

<p>
That &quot;psychic's&quot; stunt can be staged in very convincing ways, like:
<ul>
<li> The &quot;psychic&quot; writes his prediction on a piece of paper.
<li> The paper is put into an envelope, which is sealed by several witnesses who put
their seals on the envelope, and sign it and date it, and even add code numbers to
later verify that it's the envelope they sealed.
<li> The envelope is kept locked in a safe or bank vault for a long time,
until after The Big Event has happened.
<li> Then, in a big showy ceremony, in front of hundreds of witnesses and
many TV cameras, the safe is opened and the envelope is removed from the
safe and opened, and there it is for all to see: <b>unquestionable proof</b>
that the &quot;psychic&quot; predicted the event.
</ul>
<p>
You guessed it: the safe is also <i>full</i> of failed predictions,
which the con artists happily ignore.
(There may even be another envelope in the safe that contains a prediction that
is the exact opposite of what just happened... The code numbers on the envelopes
tell the con artists which prediction is in which envelope.)

<p>
Another way to use observational selection to get desired results is to do
many studies or tests, and only report the results that you like. For example, suppose
you are a P.R. firm hired to make Buzz Cola look better than Fizz Cola.
You could get 1000 people to do a taste test, to see which they liked better,
but you don't. You do 100 &quot;tests&quot;, each of which have only 10 people in them.
In 95 of the tests, the people liked Fizz Cola better. But by random chance,
in the other 5 tests, a majority of the people liked Buzz better. So you report,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;In test after test, a majority of the people chose Buzz Cola over Fizz.&quot;<br>
</font>
Technically, that statement is true, even if it is deceptive as can be.
You just don't bother to mention all of the other tests where the people liked Fizz better.
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font size="-1" color="#9F0000">
<i>I didn't mean to pick on any real cola brand names there. I wrote that
paragraph many years ago, and just made up the names &quot;Buzz&quot;
and &quot;Fizz&quot; to avoid using names like &quot;Coke&quot;&reg; and &quot;Pepsi&quot;&reg;.
That was years before I ever heard of any Buzz or Fizz Cola. Years later, I was really surprised to find that
somebody used <b>both</b> of those names for actual brands of soft drinks.
Sometimes, reality mimicks satire.</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
And obviously, another way to rig any test or study is to <i>cherry-pick</i>
the people who will be in the test. If you want 'Group A' to look better than 'Group B',
then put all of the promising candidates in Group A, and put all of the losers
in Group B. (That is why real valid tests must be randomized. You must throw dice,
or pick names out of a hat, or something like that,
to choose which people go into which group.)

<p>
The government uses a subtle form of observational selection and cherry-picking in
reporting the national unemployment rate: They only report those people who are actively
looking for work <i>at the unemployment office</i>. People who have despaired and given
up looking for work, or who are still looking but have simply stopped asking at the unemployment office,
are erased from the rolls of &quot;the unemployed&quot;, and are not counted when the government
calculates the national unemployment rate.
(Likewise, someone who accepts a menial job for minimal wages out of
sheer desperation &#8212; even a part-time minimum-wage job &#8212; is considered no longer unemployed.)
The real unemployment rate is always much higher than the government
reports, no matter which political party controls the government. They all misreport the facts.



<p>
Another example of observational selection:<br>
<b>Smith:</b>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I have here 29 files that describe cases where people went to
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and quit drinking. So we have a <i>demonstrated relationship</i>
between people going to meetings and quitting drinking.&quot;<br>
</font>
<b>Jones:</b>
<font color="blue">
&quot;How many cases of failure were there, where the people went to
A.A. meetings but didn't quit drinking?&quot;<br>
</font>
<b>Smith:</b>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I didn't study them. They weren't interesting,
because they were just failures. I'm more interested in what works.
Besides, those other people don't count because they didn't keep
coming back.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is just like Bill Wilson only printing selected success stories in
the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
And that is just like how Alcoholics Anonymous claims a great success rate today.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">The people who relapse
and leave are not counted</a> &#8212; A.A. says that they didn't &quot;work the program&quot; right,
or they didn't &quot;keep coming back&quot;, so they don't count. Only
the people who stay in A.A. and attend many meetings (usually because
they quit drinking) get counted.

<p>
Some treatment facilities use a variation on <i>Observational Selection</i> &#8212;
they cherry-pick their patients, drafting into
their program as many of the most promising prospective patients as they can get,
in order to improve their &quot;success rate&quot;:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;You have someone who just quit drinking two weeks ago? You say that
he quit once before, and stayed sober for three years, all on his own,
without any treatment or A.A. or anything &#8212; just going it alone? Quick!
Shove him into our treatment program, so that we can 'treat' him, and
teach him how to stay sober for six months. Then we can score him as one
of our 'success stories'.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
(That story is <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">100% autobiographical</a> &#8212;
that's my own personal experience with a &quot;treatment program&quot;.)<br>
</font>
<p>
Likewise, most all treatment centers are very deceptive when they
advertize their success rates &#8212; they only reveal what percentage of
the <i>program graduates</i> are sober shortly after the end of the
program. They ignore all
of the people who drop out, flunk out, and relapse and disappear, and do
not include them in the reported statistics.
(They <a href="#rationalize">rationalize</a> that deception by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, they didn't finish the program, so they don't count.&quot;</font>)
<p>
If 100 people start a program, and ten of them last until graduation, and 8
of them are still clean and sober a month later, then the treatment center advertizes
an 80% success rate. That is obviously false. A mere 8% success rate is obviously
closer to the truth. But then the treatment centers do not do a follow-up a
year later, to see what the real long-term success rate is. That would reveal
even more failures. In the final analysis, the success rate of the treatment
programs is little or nothing more than
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">the normal rate of spontaneous remission</a>
&#8212; the success rate of people who get no treatment at all (approximately 5% per year).
<p>
And I know of a drug treatment program that rejects, and will not even
try to treat, any and all people who have been treated before and
then relapsed &#8212; even their own graduates &#8212;
because the program managers are afraid that those relapsers will
relapse again and
pull down the program's average &quot;success rate&quot;.
That program also discounts all of their dropouts
and relapsers. When someone &quot;goes out&quot; and uses drugs, or gets
arrested for something, the counselors simply erase that person's
name from the list of patients,
and they do not count him in computing their success rate.
Then they claim that their program is very successful and greatly
reduces the crime rate of their patients (those few remaining patients
who are not currently out stealing to get a fix).
<p>
When such a treatment center announces that it has reduced crime in its
patients by a certain amount, it is lying with statistics. It is not
revealing the resulting average crime rate of all of the clients who
started treatment; the T.C. is only revealing the average crime rate
of those few successful patients who are still sticking with the program
and still abstaining from drugs and alcohol.

Another kind of observational selection is interpreting data in a biased manner,

That is illustrated in this story:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A drug and alcohol treatment center that used acupuncture on its clients
(<a href="orange-letters154.html#Harry" target="_blank&quot;">PAAC</a>)
wanted to show that acupuncture reduced
cravings for drugs and alcohol in patients who were in recovery, so that

&quot;No, actually it hasn't. I just don't have a problem with cravings
for alcohol. I didn't have any cravings the last time I quit drinking, all on my own,
without any treatment or acupuncture,
and I don't have any this time either. I am too busy crawling the walls for a
cigarette to crave alcohol.&quot;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The counselor wrote &quot;acupuncture reduced cravings&quot; anyway.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>That story is also autobiographical, and 100% true.</b>
</font>

<p>
Later, the city and state agencies received a report that declared that
a survey of the patients found that acupuncture was very helpful for
reducing their cravings for drugs and alcohol, so the city agencies and
the state health plan should continue to fund acupuncture treatment of
patients in recovery.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
Notice that there was also no control group. That is, there should have been
another group of patients who received no acupuncture, who were also surveyed
to find out how much they were bothered by cravings. Then you compare the
results from the two groups to determine what effect, if any, the acupuncture
actually had on cravings for drugs or alcohol.
<p>
Unfortunately, such
properly-conducted research is almost never done by substance-abuse
treatment centers.
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">Their findings</a>
are usually just as phony as their

<p>
Another good stunt is to take surveys at A.A. or N.A. meetings.
Only the faithful members who <i>Keep Coming Back</i> will be there to
answer the questions. Asking,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Is there anyone here for whom the Twelve Steps did not work?&quot;<br></font>
is the same stupid thing as asking,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Will everyone who isn't here please raise your hand?&quot;<br></font>
(Never mind the fact that it also immediately leads to an
&quot;Emperor's New Clothes&quot; situation where no one wants to
confess that he is the only unspiritual one for whom the Steps are
not working...)

<p>
Observational selection does not have to be deliberate.
One of the ever-present dangers to a researcher is accidental or unconscious
bias in making observations. In
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#LSD_Toronto1" target="_blank">a study of the use of LSD in therapy for alcoholism</a>, the
authors also studied the methods that other studies had used.
Their observations were disconcerting &#8212; it seems that people
have an unfortunate tendency to see whatever they wish to see
whenever tests are not rigidly controlled.
The various psychiatric treatments and medications being tested were
successful in 83 percent of the <i>uncontrolled</i> studies, but only
in 25 percent of the <i>controlled</i> studies.
How curious. It would seem that looking too closely, and measuring
too carefully, makes the medicines or treatments suddenly stop working.
<p>
That's a good example of <i>researcher bias</i>. The researchers just
really wanted their experiments to be sucesses, so that's what they
tended to see. But when their studies were rigorously controlled, then the
researchers were forced to be more objective, and the observed success rate
dropped sharply. (That is also why the FDA prefers <i>double-blind</i> studies,
where neither the patients nor the doctors know whether the patients are
getting the real medicine or a placebo.)
<p>
A variation on the theme of Observational Selection is getting biased
data even when you don't wish to. In one survey, researchers sent
out questionaires that essentially asked people to honestly reveal their
racist attitudes. Not surprisingly, a lot of the questionaires were
simply never returned, and lots more reported that the
respondents just didn't have any racist attitudes at all.
As you can imagine, the resulting statistics showed that racism and
racist attitudes were almost non-existent.



<p><br>
<a name="I_didnt_see"> </a>
<li> <b>I Didn't See It Happen, So It Didn't Happen</b><br>
<p>
This is a variation on Observational Selection. This logical fallacy
tries to declare that something didn't happen just because the speaker didn't
see it happen.
This is often a form of denial:

<ul>
<p><li> I never saw such a thing in our meetings.
<p><li> Nobody recalls ever having heard of that happening.
<p><li> It is highly unlikely that that really happened, because nobody has ever seen
that happen before.
<p><li> That never happens in our organization.
<p><li> I never saw one of our people do that.
<p><li> If such a thing had happened in our company, I would know about it.
</ul>
<p>
A.A. uses this logical fallacy often:

<ul>
<p><li> I never saw such a thing in our meetings.
<p><li> That doesn't happen in our group.
<p><li> I've been going to meetings for 20 years, and I never saw any such thing.
<p><li> I've never seen a sponsor seducing an underage girl...
</ul>
<p>
Like Carl Sagan said, &quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;

<a name="small_numbers"> </a>
<li> <b>The Statistics of Small Numbers</b><br>
Also beware of <i>The Statistics of Small Numbers</i>, which is a
different kind of observational selection. It is an error caused by
looking at too small of a sample. For instance,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They say that one out of every five people on Earth is Chinese.
That can't be true. I know hundreds and hundreds of people, and
only three of them are Chinese. So Chinese people must be pretty
rare, really...&quot;
</font>
<p>
A variation of that is: A wildlife program on Public Television says:
<font color="blue">
&quot;One out of every four mammals is a bat.&quot;</font><br>

Well, let's see...
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I know I'm not a bat, and my wife isn't a bat, and Joe isn't
a bat, so Harry must be a bat.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Variations on <i>The statistics of small numbers</i> include:
<ul>
<li> Hasty Generalization: Generalizing from too-small a sample.
<li> Inductive Generalization
<li> Insufficient Sample
<li> Insufficient Statistics
<li> Leaping to Conclusion
<li> Lonely Fact
<li> Statistical Generalization
<li> Converse Accident
</ul>

<p><br>
<i>The statistics of small numbers</i> problem appears in discussions
of A.A. often. People will say things like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We don't have any
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">nasty thirteenth-stepping sexual predators</a>
in our group,&quot;</font>
and imagine that every other group in the whole country must be just the
same, and that it doesn't happen anywhere else either. Unfortunately,
it does.
<p>
Likewise,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Nobody in our group has committed suicide, so those stories about

unless you know every member of your group very well, and keep track
of all of them, and check up on them, and know what shape each drop-out,

commit suicide <i>at the A.A. meetings</i>, do you? And again, you have
no idea what is happening in the other A.A. groups that you don't visit.
They sure aren't going to email you to broadcast the news about

<a name="bury_the_lead"> </a>
<li> <b>Bury The Lead</b><br>

Burying the lead (pronounced, &quot;leed&quot;) is a newspaper term. It means that you hide the most important fact
in the story down at the bottom of the article.
<p>
For example, a recent newspaper article about the soaring price of oil tried to
explain the price increases in terms of speculators buying oil futures,
and political instability in foreign countries causing uncertainty in
the market. Then they gradually got around to mentioning that India and
China have booming economies that want ever more oil. And then finally,
in the last sentence of the article, someone said, &quot;Oil is getting
harder to find.&quot;

<p>
Historically, one of the best examples of <i>Burying The Lead</i> was when the
New York Times casually mentioned in a small article on page 9 of an issue, many
months after the Year 2000 Presidential election, that if we had counted all of the votes (which is,
after all, what you are supposed to do in a democracy), that Al Gore actually
won the election.

<li> <b>The Big Lie</b><br>

The <i>Big Lie</i> is a technique that Adolf Hitler used with great success.
The idea is that you just keep repeating the same lie over and over,
in spite of all arguments or evidence to the contrary, until people
believe it.
Massive repetition is essential. (Think: &quot;Why do they keep
running the same stupid commercials on TV, over and over and
over again, <i>ad nauseum</i>?&quot;)

<p>
Hitler explained his <i>Big Lie</i> technique in <i>Mein Kampf</i>,<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The greatness of the lie is always a certain factor in being believed;
at the bottom of their hearts, the great masses of a people are more
likely to be misled than to be consciously and deliberately bad, and
in the primitive simplicity of their minds, they are more easily
victimized by a large than by a small lie.... Some part of even the
boldest lie is sure to stick.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's a strange fact of human psychology that giant, totally outrageous lies
are sometimes more believable than small lies, just by virtue of their
bodaciousness.
People feel that there must be <i>something</i> to it, because the
claims are so extreme. People can't help but feel that
<i>&quot;Where there is so much smoke, there must be some fire.&quot;</i>  Hitler explained:
<p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All this was inspired by the principle &#8212; which is quite true in itself &#8212; that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying. These people know only too well how to use falsehood for the basest purposes...<br>
</font>
&#8212;  Adolf Hitler,  <i>Mein Kampf</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
In using the <i>Big Lie</i> technique, Hitler said, essentially,
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
The Jews are an inferior race. The Jews have always been
the thieving greedy bankers and money-lenders, bleeding the lifeblood
out of our country. Everybody knows that the Jews are the cause of
all of our problems, and now that we are imposing the Final Solution, we
will soon be much better off without them.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Today, the fascist rap is,
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
Drug users and dealers are inferior people. They are really low,
dirty and disgusting bums who deserve to die because they are drug
users and dealers, and they don't care about anything but getting
high. Everybody knows that they are the major cause of all of our
problems. When we impose the death sentence for more and more
drug offenses, we will finally get rid of those dopers, and we will
be much better off without them.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
Those poor, long-suffering rich people desperately need a tax cut.
They have been treated so badly by the government for so long, it's
the least we can do to make it up to them.
(Heck, some of them are down to their last billion.)
Giving the rich people a tax cut will stimulate the economy so much
that soon the wealth will trickle down, and we will all benefit from

On Jan. 27, 2004, NBC Evening News reported that the death toll of civilians
killed in Iraq in the Bush vs. Saddam War

died on September 11, so that's a lot of pay-back.

Osama bin Laden from Saudi Arabia, remember? (The guy whom the CIA armed and
funded during the Russia-Afghanistan War.)

In just the two-week period from April 1 to April 15, 90 Americans and

If reminds me of the Nazi reprisals during WWII. If one German soldier was killed
by The Resistance in an occupied town, the Nazis would get their revenge by
randomly shooting hundreds of civilians in that town, just making sure that
somebody was always punished, even if it wasn't the people who did it.
<p>
When the German S.S. Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Reinhard Heydrich was assassinated in Czechoslovakia
by the Czech underground, the Germans simply totally annihilated a nearby
town &#8212; Lidice &#8212; in reprisal.
They immediately shot all of the men, and sent the women and children to concentration
camps, where most of them eventually died. Then they burned and blasted and bull-dozed
the town until nothing was left but rubble, and then the Germans erased the name of the
town from the maps.
<p>
When the war ended, the Allies assembled at the Geneva Convention and
wrote up the Geneva Accords, which made such group punishment a war crime.
(But then Donald Rumsfeld, G. W. Bush's Secretary of Defense, announced that the
Geneva Convention was obsolete and that he did not wish to be limited by it.)

<p>
Here, Bill Wilson quoted
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry M. Tiebout</a> quoting Bill Wilson, as if
that would add authority to Bill's faked numbers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous claims a recovery rate of 75 percent of those
who really try their methods. This figure, coupled with their mushroom growth,
commands respect and demands explanation.&quot;<br>

page 310.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, such a figure commands contempt and derision, because it is a bare-faced lie.
Alcoholics Anonymous never had a success rate anything like 75%; they didn't even get a tenth of that.
Notice how Tiebout repeated
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's grossly inflated and
exaggerated claims of success</a>
as if they were true facts, and even cited them in professional journals.
That is the <i>Big Lie</i> technique, one more time again.
<p>
<font color="blue">
[Also notice how cleverly Tiebout covered his own ass: He started off by saying that
A.A. merely <i>claimed to have</i> a 75% success rate &#8212; a rate which Tiebout had to know was
totally untrue, because Tiebout was Bill's psychiatrist, and Tiebout had a number of other patients
in A.A., too, so he could see what was going on.
But then Tiebout just accepted Bill's grossly exaggerated claims as
correct, and declared that they &quot;commanded respect and demanded
explanation&quot;. If anyone called Tiebout on it later by pointing out
just how inaccurate those numbers really were, Tiebout could always just pass
the buck to A.A., and say that he was just using their numbers.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
And the psychiatrist Dr. Tiebout accepted those inflated numbers as
valid, in spite of
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#majesty" target="_blank">his own diagnosis</a>
of Bill Wilson's mental state as
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">immature

Bill Wilson was trying to live out &quot;the infantilely grandiose demands&quot; of

Since then, numerous A.A. shills have parrotted those false numbers without doing any

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And they have been doing that for a very long time, too.
This phony &quot;review&quot; of the &quot;Big Book&quot; <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> was
published in <i>The New York Times</i> in 1939. It was actually written by a
hidden A.A. true believer &#8212; Percy Hutchison, the New York Times <i>poetry editor</i>
&#8212; who was scheming with Bill Wilson and the other early A.A. members
to help sell the new A.A. book,
not by any neutral observer or dispassionate critic, or by anybody who knew anything about
treating alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lest this title should arouse the risibles in any reader let me state
that the general thesis of &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; is more
soundly based psychologically than any other treatment of the
subject I have ever come upon.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; is unlike any other book ever before
published.  No reviewer can say how many have contributed to its pages.
But the list of writers should include addicts and doctors, psychiatrists
and clergymen.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here, then, is the key to &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous,&quot; the great
and indisputable lesson this
extraordinary book would convey. The alcoholic addict
<!--
, and why not change, should it seem we
have become too intense, to &quot;the drug addict,&quot;
-->
...
cannot, by any effort of what he calls his &quot;will,&quot;
insure himself against taking his &quot;first dose.&quot;
We saw how the chap with his whiskey in milk
missed out. There is one way for our authors, and but one way.
The utter suffusion of the mind by an idea which shall exclude
any idea of alcohol or of drugs.<br>
...<br>
The thesis of the book is, if we read it aright, that this all-embracing
and all-commanding idea must be religious.
...
There is no suggestion advanced in the book that an addict should embrace
one faith rather than another.
He may fall back upon an &quot;absolute,&quot; or &quot;A Power which
makes for righteousness&quot; if he chooses.
The point of the book is that he is unlikely to win through unless he
floods his mind with the idea of a force outside himself. So doing, his
individual problem resolves into thin air. In last analysis, it is the
resigning word: Not my will, but Thine, be done, said in the full
knowledge of the fact that the decision will be against further
addiction.<br>
...<br>
The argument, as we have said, has a deep psychological foundation.<br>

<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung" target="_blank"><i>religiomania</i></a> &#8212;
maniacal obsession with religion &#8212;
and faith healing as the best cure for alcoholism.
Religiomania and faith healing are not &quot;soundly based psychologically&quot;,
and they do not have &quot;a deep psychological foundation&quot;.
Nevertheless, the A.A. true believers persistently claim that A.A. does,
even while they simultaneously
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#unscientific_doctors" target="_blank">brag that A.A. is

What does a poetry editor know about medicine, alcoholism, or human psychology?

How could Hutchison claim to know that the problem of alcoholism would

When did Percy Hutchison become qualified to advise the public about critical

Isn't that the job of the medical editor or the science editor or

<p>
Let me guess &#8212; Hutchison suggested the book to the newspaper's editors,
and volunteered to review it,
because he really wanted people to hear about a &quot;wonderful new fellowship
that had a magical new treatment program for alcoholism...&quot;
<p>
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg5" target="_blank">The June 1940 financial report of &quot;Works Publishing&quot;</a> says that the
original New York A.A. group used
the New York Times Book Review and several other media outlets to publicize and tout

Obviously, that so-called &quot;book review&quot; was
a fraud &#8212; a very biased piece of promotional propaganda, a commercial for
the book, not a fair objective analysis of the Alcoholics Anonymous program.

drinking for a year or more do it alone, on their own. That only
leaves 20% who could possibly have recovered
through Alcoholics Anonymous, and lots of those 20% did it in other ways too,

<a name="reversal"> </a>
<li> <b>Reversal Of Reality</b>, and <b>Counter-attack by Reversal of Reality</b><br>
Have the nerve to completely reverse reality, and say the exact opposite of the truth.

<p>
A young woman wrote:
&quot;My roommate 'borrows' my clothes without my permission and she leaves them
sweat-stained and stretched out. They are ruined. When I complain about it, she says that I am selfish.&quot;

<p>
When white women comprise the majority of the women receiving welfare, say that Black women
comprise the majority of the women on welfare.
<p>
As evidence accumulated that the Bush administration had lied, fabricated evidence,
distorted other evidence, and hidden contradictory facts about the Weapons of Mass Destruction
in Iraq in order to manufacture an excuse to go to war, Vice President Dick Cheney declared:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The President and I cannot prevent certain politicians from losing their memory
or their backbone, but we're not going to sit by and
let them rewrite history.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161130003614/http://www.time.com/time/verbatim/20051121/1.html" target="_blank">TIME, Nov 21-27, 2005</a>)
</font>
<p>
Likewise, when CIA agent Valerie Plame's cover was blown, Bush declared:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are going to find those leakers and take care of them.&quot;<br>
</font>
Of course, George Bush and Dick Cheney and their White House Chiefs of
Staff turned out to be the leakers, but that's okay, Scott McClellan
said, because George had already declassified the secret information
and approved of the leaks before they leaked it &#8212; so George knew who
the leakers were even as he swore on TV that he would catch the leakers.

<p><br>
2011.01.10:
In the past few years, political rhetoric has become increasingly hostile and vicious.
Sarah Palin's
web site showed pictures of Democrats' districts with rifle cross-hairs on them, and
Palin repeatedly instructed followers to &quot;lock and load&quot; and &quot;reload&quot;.
And the Tea Party language was even worse, with barely-veiled death threats, and appeals for
&quot;Second-Amendment (gun) solutions&quot; to problems.
<p>
In the debate following the attempted assassination of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords,
the local sheriff in Tucson, Arizona, denounced the language of violence, and said that he felt
that it had contributed to the shooting.
Republican talking heads immediately responded by saying that his criticism of Right-wing inflamatory
speech was &quot;over the top&quot; and &quot;rhetoric&quot;, and
&quot;inappropriate for an elected official&quot;.
That is reversal of reality.
<p>
2011.01.12:
Sarah Palin released a video where she complained about how she had suffered from attacks ever
since the shooting, and that she was the victim of a &quot;blood libel&quot;.
As if she suffered from a bullet through the head, or had lost a daughter or husband in the
shooting. That is reversal of reality. That is also a good example of the Prima Donna Ploy,
making it all about
<a href="#drama_queen">The Drama Queen</a>.

<p>
Another reversal of reality: A company that wants to set up a non-Indian casino
(a new precedent for Oregon) advertises on TV that they will create millions of
dollars &#8212; declaring that they will give the community millions of dollars
in new taxes,
and create thousands of new jobs with health care, and raise millions of dollars for education. The truth is,
casinos never create money. They take money from people. Casinos do not manufacture anything of value;
they just take money from the mathematically challenged customers.
Ultimately, in the long run, casinos make states poorer, not richer.
The end product of casinos is more impoverished citizens.

<p>
Worse yet, the market for casinos is saturated. Now almost every state has legalized gambling in some form
or another, and gamblers no longer need to drive to Las Vegas or Atlantic City to gamble.
There is another casino just down the road, or just across the state line. Now the casinos
are just fighting over market share, with one casino stealing customers from another.
The casino business has become a zero-sum game, where one casino's gain is another's loss.
Another casino doesn't make more money for the community; it just makes some for the occasional lucky casino owner
while reducing the profits of a neighboring casino.
<p>
In another reversal of reality, a political commercial declares that the Democrats are hurting
America by raising the debt ceiling and spending money on welfare programs, and that we should &quot;put families first&quot; instead.
That is a reversal of reality. Not raising the debt ceiling has resulted in cutting funding for food
stamps, which is just the opposite of &quot;putting families first.&quot;
That is putting families last by taking food out of the mouths of children,
and putting billionaires who don't want to pay taxes first.



<p><br>
<a name="wishful"> </a>
<li> <b>Wishful Thinking</b><br>
Just say whatever you wish was true.
<p>
A politician declares, &quot;My opponent is in trouble with the voters because of his stand on...&quot;
when that isn't true at all, the politician just wishes it was true.
<p>
Similar lines include:

<ul>
<li> &quot;We are surging ahead, and marching towards a landslide victory in November.&quot;
<li> &quot;The voters strongly agree with our platform, and are rallying to our cause.&quot;
<li> &quot;The voters hate my opponent and are tired of his policies.&quot;
<li> &quot;Our agenda is based on irrefutable truths.&quot;
</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="projection"> </a>
<li> <b>Projection</b><br>

Projection is a psychological technique where someone accuses other people of the sins and crimes of
which he himself is guilty. Projection is also a kind of reversal of reality.

<p>
For example, Adolf Hitler cited the forged document called  
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Protocols" target="_blank"><i>The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</i></a>
as proving that the Jews had a secret program to take over the world by using deceit, lies, murder,
planned wars,
and all sorts of evil conspiracies, but it was actually Adolf Hitler himself who was carrying out
such a plan for world domination. Hitler was doing all of the things for which he denounced the Jews.

<p>
Similarly, cult leaders routinely accuse their followers and also outsiders
of greed and lust while they steal all of the money and pretty women for themselves.
And politicians are notorious for loudly denouncing the decline in national morals while they take
bribes, drink like fish, and use their secretarial staff as a stable of mistresses.
Some of the most vocal anti-homosexual Congressmen turned out to be closetted homosexuals who were
screwing boys in the Congressional gymnasium.

<p><br>
<a name="make_virtue"> </a>
<li> <b>Make a Virtue out of a Fault</b><br>
Advertise and promote a shortcoming or a fault as a virtue.
<p>
For example, ultra-cheap single-use film cameras are advertised as &quot;No Focusing Required.&quot;
The truth is, no focusing is possible, because those cameras have cheap plastic fixed-focus lenses
that won't move and can't be focused.
What is a serious shortcoming for a camera &#8212; the inability to properly
focus on the subject &#8212; is sold as a convenience:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You don't have to bother with focusing.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses this technique too. When the founder Bill Wilson
is shown to have been a fraud, a liar,
a <a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">felonious thief</a>,
a <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">certified nutcase</a>,
a <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">philandering sexual predator</a>, and
a con artist who sold cult religion as a quack cure for alcoholism, the true believers proclaim,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Isn't it wonderful? It just goes to show that Bill Wilson was human.
And if he could get sober, then so can we. God wanted Bill to be less than
perfect so that he could be a good example for us all.&quot;<br>

Besides, that is all a smoke screen &#8212;

The real bottleneck in producing more gasoline now is refineries &#8212; there
have been almost no new refineries built in the USA in the last 30 years.
Even worse, the oil companies are actually shutting down refineries to force
gasoline prices even higher &#8212; so of course the supply of gasoline is tight.

And the Republicans are notorious for killing alternative energy projects.
President Carter started a lot of them, and then President Reagan shut them all

The alcoholic, realizing what his wife has endured, and now fully understanding how much
he himself did to damage her and his children, nearly always takes up his marriage
responsibilities with a willingness to repair what he can and to accept what he can't.
He persistently tries all of A.A.'s Twelve Steps in his home, often with fine results.
At this point he firmly but lovingly commences to behave like a partner instead of
a bad boy. And above all he is finally convinced that reckless romancing is not a

<a name="association"> </a>
<li> <b>Use Association</b><br>

Association is just linking together two unrelated things.
Often, it creates an emotional reaction in the intended audience.
It can be anything like Guilt by Association, Honor by Association, or
Desirability by Association, depending on what somebody or something
is associated with.
<p>
Advertisers routinely associate beautiful women in skimpy clothes
with new cars, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, clothes, and diamond
jewelry. TV commercials teach us that we can get laid if we use the
right toothpaste and the right under-arm deodorant. So we have been
programmed to consciously or unconsciously associate sex with all
kinds of strange things.
<p>
Likewise, many commercials teach us to associate sugar consumption with happiness.
Children are taught by TV commercials
that eating gobs of sugar is really a lot of fun, and parents are taught that giving
sugar to children is how they show the children love.

<p>
Politicians also routinely kiss babies, hug children, and hobnob with
other, more popular and powerful politicians, to look good by
association.
They also love to rub elbows with the the rich, the famous, and
the beautiful people, like movie stars and sports heroes, for the
same reason. And of course they want to be photographed with a good
selection of wise men like university professors, Nobel prize winners,
and high-ranking religious leaders, to look good by association.

<p>
Politicians will also, occasionally, associate their opponents with
some villainous characters, perhaps Adolf Hitler, Mao Tse Tung,
Joseph Stalin, or Ghengis Khan, to make their opponents look dangerous
and evil. (Sometimes the comparison is unfair, and sometimes it isn't.
It all depends.)
<p>

The Scientology propaganda book
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Scientology_what" target="_blank">What Is
Scientology</a>&quot;</i>
devotes 16 pages (xiv to xxix) to showing you pictures of beautiful,
palatial
buildings that the organization owns around the world, and
the last &quot;building&quot; is really a large ship,
the <i>Freewinds</i>.
What do those beautiful buildings and that beautiful ship
have to do with whether Scientology is a good organization,
or whether it
can help you with your mental problems, or with whether you
should give all of your money to Scientology? Absolutely nothing.
They are just trying to impress you, to make you think that
Scientology is really a big, high-class outfit, not the sleazy,
low, money-grubbing con that it actually is.

<p>
A powerful association that I find in my own mind is that, ever since
September 11, every time I see a photograph of an American Airlines jet,
I see it crashing into a skyscraper,
or blowing up as it comes out through the wall of a skyscraper.
There is no skyscraper in the picture; my mind just fills it in because
of those televised images that were burned into my mind on September 11.
That is totally unfair to American Airlines, of course. It wasn't their
fault that some terrorists chose to hijack some of their flights.
Nevertheless, American Airlines has a real problem with that association
that has been planted in so many people's minds.
<p>
Similarly, before September 11, the public perception of firemen was
something like &quot;a bunch of adventurous young guys and overgrown
boy scouts with too much testosterone, who are living out a childhood
fantasy of being firemen and getting their kicks by driving big red
trucks real fast.&quot;
After September 11, the image is &quot;a bunch of heroic guys who
rush into burning towers to save people, and die when the building
comes down on their heads.&quot;
<p>

That's the power of association.
<p>
<a name="ftnt13_ret"> </a>
A corollary to association is something that I like to call
&quot;reverse association&quot; &#8212; basking in reflected glory by
honoring others (who may be totally out of your league).
An easy way to accomplish that is to hand out &quot;awards&quot;,
honoring others for something or other.
An interesting example of &quot;reverse association&quot; is:
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan received the <i>Enron Prize for
Distinguished Public Service</i> from Ken Lay in November, 2001, less
than three weeks before Enron filed for bankruptcy. Now I'll guess that
Greenspan wishes he had never accepted the
award.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt13">13</a></sup></font>

<p>
<i>Guilt By Association</i> is of course a negative association.
It is like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Senator Blowhard had lunch with Ken Lay, Andy Fastow,
and Jeffrey Skilling of Enron. Therefore Senator Blowhard is just as corrupt
as them.&quot;<br>
</font>
We do not really know anything about Blowhard's integrity, just from that.
He is not
automatically guilty just because he associated with those guys one time.<br>

<font color="blue">
<i>(But if he often associated with them, and took lots of money from them,
and rode around in their jet while campaigning for office, like George W. Bush
did, then that is another matter.... And if his Vice President then arranged the
energy regulations so that Enron could massively rob the State of California
with artificially inflated electricity prices,
then that is very suspicious.)</i>

<p><br>
<a name="glittering_generality"> </a>
<li> <b>The Glittering Generality</b><br>
<i>The Glittering Generality</i> is a kind of <i>Association</i> technique.
<p>
American politicians routinely wave the American flag and
praise God, country, Democracy, Freedom, Mom, and apple pie,
trying to create links in people's minds (associations) between themselves and those
other positive images.
<p>
So salt and pepper your speeches with zillions of flowery phrases and
wonderful-sounding words and vague glittering generalities:
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;God, country, Mom and apple pie&quot;
<li> &quot;Patriotism, Freedom, Democracy, and the good old USA&quot;
<li> &quot;safety and national security&quot;
<li> &quot;<a href="orange-rroot270.html#simple_home_truths" target="_blank">those simple home truths that
some of us learned at our mother's knee</a>, and which many of us
have forgotten and neglected &#8212; honesty, purity, unselfishness
and love.&quot;
<li> &quot;inspiration and liberty for all&quot;
<li> &quot;the great creative sources in the Mind of God&quot;
<li> &quot;the combined moral and spiritual forces of the nation&quot;
<li> &quot;Christian values&quot;
<li> &quot;The Love of Jesus&quot;
<li> &quot;The Glory of God&quot;
<li> &quot;The Power of the Almighty&quot;
<li> &quot;The Will of God&quot;
<li> &quot;family values&quot;
<li> &quot;Freedom is on the march.&quot;
<li> &quot;Our wonderful patriotic troops who are fighting for Freedom in Iraq&quot;
<li> &quot;The wonderful men and women who serve in our volunteer army&quot;
<li> &quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;organic&quot;
</ul>
<p>
It is really tragic how many innocent people have been murdered in the name of
Freedom, Democracy, and Christian family values... (Just recently, 30,000 children in Iraq,
and before that, zillions of Nicaraguans,
<a href="orange-Diener-postings.html#Guatemalan_killings" target="_blank">Guatemalans</a>
and Vietnamese.)
<p>
Today, &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;organic&quot; are very popular Glittering Generalities.
Things are supposedly good because they are &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;organic&quot;.
That is a very unrealistic generalization.
Just because something is natural does not mean that it
is good for you. Arsenic, cyanide and rattlesnake poison are all natural.
So are Black Widow Spider venom and scorpion venom, and Puffer Fish poison.
<p>
Advertisements for some cigarettes brag that their tobacco is completely natural and
free from additives and chemicals, so it is somehow less harmful to people's bodies.
That is completely non-sensical logic. Tobacco in any form is poisonous, and
tobacco kills 430,000 U.S. citizens per year, regardless of what chemicals it may or
may not have added to it.

<p>
A common variation on <i>The Glittering Generality</i> is invoking images of <i>&quot;The Golden Age&quot;</i>.
Imply that there was a much better, happier, time way back in the past &#8212; &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; &#8212;
when everything was wonderful &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;everybody was happy, everybody was kind and decent, everybody obeyed the law,
everybody believed in God, the rulers were wise, just and honest,
and children obeyed their parents&quot;</font>.
<p>
(The myth of the Golden Age completely igmores the fact that without penicillin and other antibiotics, and without
vaccines against horrendous diseases like the Black Plague and Smallpox, people died in agony by the millions.
There is another name for that &quot;golden age&quot;  &#8212;  they call it &quot;the Dark Ages&quot;.)

<p>

Sometimes this Golden Age is embodied in a popular myth, like
 <i>The Tales of King Arthur and Camelot</i>, where noble
knights believed in <i>Might For Right</i> (not &quot;Might Makes Right&quot;),
and the brave knights spent their time rescuing fair damsels in distress.
And of course, the wizards of <i>The Olden Times</i>,
like Merlin, were much wiser and much more powerful than today's wizards, and their magic was so much
better than today's magic...
And the maidens in those days were beautiful and pure and chaste, and the knights were all
honorable and chivelrous and brave and heroic.  And the king was the wisest and most noble of kings.

<p>
Then the speaker invokes an appeal to return to the Good Old Days &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We must get Back to the Basics, and Back to Traditional Values&quot;.</i></font>
<p>
Adolf Hitler and the Nazis actually used those terms &#8212;
<i>&quot;Back to the Basics&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Traditional Values&quot;</i>
&#8212; in their propaganda, while campaigning for seats in the Reichstag,
and they declared that Hitler could take Germany back to &quot;The Golden Age&quot;
if elected.  (We all know how well that worked out.)
<p>
And today, Alcoholics Anonymous sub-cult leaders also run <i>&quot;Back to the Basics&quot;</i> meetings
that supposedly have the good magic of the olden days.


<p><br>
<a name="exaggerate"> </a>
<li> <b>Exaggerate</b><br>

You don't blatantly lie; you just stretch the truth a good bit.
This also has the advantage that even if you get caught at it, you
can always argue that you were telling the truth, and it's all a
matter of degree, and people just got the wrong impression, or took
it the wrong way... Mark Twain explained that expanding a story wasn't
really a lie, just a &quot;stretcher&quot;.
<p>
For an example of exaggeration, this is one of the faithful followers of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">the cult leader Frank Buchman</a>
singing his praises, trying to make him sound like a citizen of the world:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...he knows China like the Chinese; he is thoroughly at home in Germany,
the Netherlands, India, America, Africa, and Australia.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A. J. Russel, <i>For Sinners Only</i>, page 82, quoted in<br>
<i>Experiment With God; Frank Buchman Reconsidered</i>, G&ouml;sta Ekman, page 57.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Frank Buchman probably did feel at home in Germany, because he was a native
German speaker, the son of German-speaking Swiss emigrants to Pennsylvania.
But it is questionable whether he was equally at home in all of those other
countries that he visited for short periods of time, unless they just
happened to have
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#Astoria" target="_blank">five-star hotels</a>,
which was really Buchman's favorite environment.
And it is absurd to say that Buchman knew China like the Chinese.
Frank Buchman only spent a couple of years in China as a missionary,
where his behavior was
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#China_work" target="_blank">so obnoxious and offensive</a>
that the Bishop of Hankow finally ordered him to stop working in China.  
<p>
For another example of exaggeration:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Japanese business and industry is such an incredible gargantuan
efficient powerhouse that it will devour American industry,
like Godzilla stomping his way through Tokyo.
We'll all end up speaking Japanese and driving Hondas.
The only hope of survival that we have is to adopt Japanese styles
of management, so that we can become more like them. And American
workers need to learn how to be more like Japanese workers, too.
They need to learn to be more loyal to their companies, and they
need to accept wage cuts and roll-backs in benefits to help save
their employers.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That was actually a real argument heard <i>very often</i> during the
seventies and eighties, when Japan was having a few good years and
taking major chunks of the American consumer-electronics and automobile
markets.
But after that, the Japanese economy crashed badly, and stayed crashed,
and it's still a dead dog.
Nobody but nobody now says that we should copy Japanese business,
industry, banking, or management styles.
In fact, the current pundits proclaim that the Japanese must
abandon their traditional ways, dump the good-old-boy system,
abandon protectionism and open up their markets,
and copy American business and banking styles if they are to
<i>ever</i> have any hope of economic recovery.

<p>
The error was in exaggerating the degree of Japanese success in the
business world, and in exaggerating the effectiveness of Japanese
management and business styles.
The speakers extrapolated a world-shaking economic
juggernaut from a few spectacular Japanese successes in making TVs,
stereos, and cars &#8212; successes that used unfair anti-competitive
practices that were sponsored by the Japanese government &#8212;
<i>&quot;Japan, Incorporated&quot;</i>. The speakers exaggerated
those Japanese successes to the point of assuming that those successes
were an unstoppable wave of the future that would go on forever,
and conquer the whole planet. (And then they told the American
workers that was why they must take pay cuts...)

<p>
In Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson made heavy use of exaggeration,
especially when discussing the success rate of the Twelve-Step program.
<ul>
<li>
If a few alcoholics sobered up for a few months, Bill claimed that the
A.A. program was a great success, and that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank"><i>everybody</i>
had benefited</a> from the program.
<li>
When Bill and Dr. Bob figured that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">their success rate was five percent</a>,
Bill advertised a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Hundred_Men" target="_blank">fifty percent success rate</a>.

<li>
When Bill and Dr. Bob
had collected 40 ex-drinkers for their little club (after two years of intense
recruiting efforts, including
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial2" target="_blank">cherry-picking</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#early_coercion" target="_blank">coercive recruiting</a>),
Bill grandly announced that
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank"><i>The First 100</i></a>&quot;
proved that Bill and Dr. Bob had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#startling_success" target="_blank">invented a
new 'spiritual' cure for alcoholism</a> that would sweep the world.

<!-----------------------------
<LI>
Then, when he wrote the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>,
Bill's 40 sober members became
&quot;<a href="orange-letters14.html#original_success" target="_blank">thousands</a>&quot;.
-------------------------------->

<li>
When a few newly-sober people felt their cravings for alcohol
gradually weaken and fade away, Bill wrote that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">God miraculously
removed the desire for drink</a> from all of the alcoholics.
</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="correlation"> </a>
<li> <b>Confusion of Correlation and Causation</b><br>

This is simple and straight-forward: just because two things tend to happen
together does not prove that one thing causes the other.
<!---
Likewise, people also often confuse association and causation, or
causation and coincidence.
--->
The rooster's crowing doesn't really make the sun rise.
<p>
Variations on this logical fallacy include:
<ol>
<li> Confusion of coincidence and causation
<li> Confusion of association and causation
<li> Confusion of correlation and causation
<li> Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between unrelated things
</ol>

<p>
Young women going to church and getting married does not really cause them
to get pregnant and have babies, even though there does seem to be a
strong correlation there. The real cause of the young women getting pregnant is
something other than the priest or minister reciting some words...
<p>
On Saturday morning, May 17th, 2014, National Public Radio did an interview about confusion of causation
and correlation that revealed:
<ul>
<li> Between the years 1999 and 2009, the more movies that Nicholas Cage acted in, the
more people died by falling into swimming pools.
<li> The more people ate cheese, the more they died by getting tangled in their bed sheets.
<li> 100% of the people who eat mashed potatoes die.
</ul>
<p>
But then the interviewee also remarked that sometimes correlations are valid, like
the correlation between people smoking and getting lung cancer. That correlation got
doctors busy investigating the link between smoking and cancer.

<p> Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship between unrelated things includes the
<b>&quot;But it worked for me,&quot;</b>
 logical fallacy. The speaker just assumes that something worked because
he got the desired result. The speaker ignores all of the other efforts that he put into
making it happen.  The classic example of that is an Alcoholics Anonymous member declaring
that the 12 Steps worked for him because he isn't drinking alcohol.  The speaker just assumes
that the Steps made him quit drinking, and he forgets that he actually quit drinking in detox
before he ever went to an A.A. meeting. He also ignores the fact that what the 12 Steps really
are is brainwashing and indoctrination techniques for religous conversion.
The 12 Steps do not even say that you should quit drinking.

<p>
Another false correlation: Some people who tout &quot;spiritual healing&quot;
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html#medical_recovery" target="_blank">routinely cite studies</a>
that show that people who have positive, cheerful attitudes recover
from illnesses and surgeries faster than people who have glum, dour
attitudes. They then assume that this is proof of the efficacy of
&quot;spiritual healing&quot;.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
They overlook the obvious fact that
those cheerful attitudes may well be caused by the the patients'
rapid recovery. People who are rapidly recovering are almost always
<i>much</i> more cheerful than patients who are sick unto death and dying.
<p><li>
And they overlook the fact that those two factors may correlate &#8212;
they may happen together: Rapid recovery causes cheerful moods, which
cause more rapid healing, which causes more cheerfulness, and so on...
Just the act of relaxing and being cheerful increases blood flow
through the body, which promotes healing and improves the functioning of the immune
system. That is simple medicine, not &quot;the power of spiritual healing&quot;.
<p><li>
They also ignore the fact that any apparent link between recovery
and something else, anything else, may be pure coincidence.
In any large group of sick people, some will recover and some won't.
There isn't necessarily any link between &quot;spiritual attitudes&quot;
and people recovering, but the people who wish to believe there
is will concentrate their attention on just the recovering &quot;spiritual&quot;
people, and ignore everything else. That, in turn, becomes an example
of &quot;<a href="#observational">observational selection</a>&quot;,
seeing what you want to see, and ignoring the rest.
<p><li>
And when the investigator has an agenda &#8212; a desired outcome &#8212; he can be
also be fooled by observational bias as well &#8212; just tending to see what
he wishes to see. The measure of which patients are cheerful, and how cheerful,
is a <font color="#9F0000"><i>subjective</i></font>
measurement &#8212; it relies entirely on the judgement
of the investigator. It is all too easy to rate the recovering patients
as very cheerful and the non-recovering patients as very glum when that
is what the investigator wishes to see.
</ul>


<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous has plenty of examples of
confusion of causation and correlation,
or confusion of coincidence with causation. The most obvious ones are:
<ul>
<li> Assuming that attending A.A. meetings makes people quit drinking.
<li> Assuming that attending A.A. meetings makes people stay sober.
<li> Assuming that doing the Twelve Steps makes people quit drinking and stay sober.
<li> Assuming that many years of membership in A.A. causes people to stay sober.
<li> Assuming that praying makes people quit drinking and stay sober.
<li> Assuming that doing the Twelve Steps makes people more
&quot;spiritual&quot;, or more moral.<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<i>
(And of course, that last item will be loaded with observational bias. Who judges?
How do you impartially judge just how much more
&quot;spiritual&quot; somebody is after doing the Twelve Steps for three or six months?
And how do you impartially distinguish between &quot;spirituality&quot; and superstition?
How do you distinguish between real spirituality and crazy self-delusion like,
<b>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#solve_all" target="_blank">Quite as important was
the discovery that spiritual principles would solve all my
problems</a>.&quot;</b>)
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
Just because some people sit in an A.A. meeting room and talk about God and not drinking
does not prove that A.A. made them quit drinking, even if they believe it.
Nor does it prove that A.A. is keeping them sober.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Using the goofy A.A. &quot;cause and effect&quot; illogic, we can happily declare that A.A. is
totally unnecessary because mothers are the real cause of sobriety.
How can we know that? Simple. Show me an alcoholic whose mother didn't tell him to
quit drinking so much.
Momma tells him to quit drinking, and then he finally does, so mothers are the real cause
of sobriety. A.A. is irrelevant and unneeded.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
What really happens is: A lot of people quit drinking in order to stop
being sick, and a lot of them get pressured or coerced into attending some
A.A. meetings, and then a few of them become obsessed with cult religions
like the Moonies or Scientology or Alcoholics Anonymous, and their favorite cult
convinces them that they are sober <i>because of</i> the cult &#8212; that
the cult saved their lives &#8212; that involvement with the cult is keeping
them sober &#8212; so they become committed to the cult and
make it their new lifestyle for a while.
They confuse coincidence with causation.
But, eventually, most of those people wise up and realize that it's all a pack
of lies, and quit the cult. In Alcoholics Anonymous, for example, 95% of the
newcomers drop out in the first year alone, and, nevertheless, a bit more than half
of all alcoholics find lasting sobriety anyway.

<a name="Fiorentine"> </a>
A common use of this propaganda technique of confusion of causation and
correlation is to do polls or surveys of A.A. members, asking them about
their drinking habits, and then &quot;discover&quot; that they drink less
than some other group of people, perhaps a group of guys at the local bar,
or the winos under the bridge.

Then the &quot;researcher&quot; declares that there is <i>&quot;an
association between AA attendance and abstinence from alcohol/drug use&quot;</i>,
and he concludes that
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
What the &quot;researcher&quot; won't tell you is that if you repeat that kind of
study, comparing the people found at the local Baskin Robbins ice cream
parlor to the guys at the local bar, you can, in just the same way,
&quot;prove&quot; that eating ice cream reduces alcohol consumption.

Also note the use of the propaganda technique called
&quot;<a href="#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;
in that quote. In the first sentence, the author Robert Fiorentine
<i>suggested</i> that A.A.
<font color="#9F0000"><i><b>may be effective</b></i></font>. He could only suggest the idea,
because he knew full well that the data did not show any cause-and-effect
relationship.
But in the next sentence, the author suddenly assumed that his suggestion
was true, and he stated that treatment providers
<font color="#9F0000"><i><b>should</b></i></font> shove patients
into Alcoholics Anonymous groups.
<p>
And lastly, note how the author completely ignored the fact that the people
at the A.A. meeting were a self-selected group
(<a href="#observational">a biased sample</a>). That is:<br>
<indent>
<font face="Helvetica,SansSerif,Swiss">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The people who wanted to stay sober went to the A.A. meetings.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The people who wanted to get drunk went to the bar.<br>
</font>
</indent>
So of course the people at the A.A. meetings drank less than the people
at the bar. That comes as no surprise. But that <i>does not</i> prove
that A.A. is somehow <i>causing</i> the &quot;meeting makers&quot; to
abstain from drinking. It doesn't even
&quot;suggest&quot; it. The author did a
<a href="#reverse_causation">reversal of a cause-and-effect relationship</a>,
because the truth is just the opposite:<br>
<p>
<font color="blue"><center>
<b>People's desire to stay sober makes them go to A.A. meetings.</b>
</center></font>
<p>
They go because they have been miseducated and fooled into believing that
A.A. is somehow necessary or &quot;helpful for maintaining sobriety&quot;.

To be fair, what the author of that &quot;study&quot; really did was
conduct interviews with the patients and ex-patients of 26 Los Angeles
area &quot;treatment programs&quot; (almost all of which were based
on &quot;Twelve Step Facilitation&quot; &#8212;
'TSF'<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt11">11</a></sup></font>),
and compare those who
were still attending A.A. meetings with those who were not. He found that
those who attended the meetings drank less and took fewer drugs.
That should come as no surprise, because, by and large,
<font color="#9F0000">
only those people who had not relapsed were still attending A.A. meetings.
</font>
Many of the relapsers really were to be found at the local bars.
<font color="#9F0000">
People stopped going to A.A. meetings when they resumed their former

Those so-called &quot;treatment programs&quot; usually have about a 90%

Another way to say it is:<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
People's desire to stay clean and sober causes some of them to go to 12-Step meetings.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
People's desire to get stoned causes them to go to the dope dealer or the liquor store.

<p>
So of course the people whom you find at the 12-Step meetings will be
a bit less drunk and stoned than those whom you find at the bar or at
the dope dealer's house.
(Even though 22% of the treatment programs' ex-clients who were going
to the A.A. and N.A. meetings were actually still using drugs or alcohol.
See the 2nd quote down.)
<p>
In another write-up of Fiorentine's Los Angeles study, we also got this misinformation:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Looking at 262 patients in 26 Los Angeles addiction treatment programs,
the researchers found that clients who attended at least one 12 Step
meeting per week after completing treatment had much lower levels of
drug use at six-month follow-up (22% were using), than those who participated
less frequently or not at all (44% were using).
Statistical analysis led Fiorentine to conclude that the better rates
of abstinence &quot;could not be attributed to differences in motivation
or to other post-treatment activities&quot;. Regular 12 Step attendance
made the difference, prompting the conclusion that 12 Step meetings work
well as &quot;a useful and inexpensive aftercare resource that can help
many patients to maintain abstinence&quot;.<br>

<font size="-1">
<i>&quot;12 STEP POWER SHOWN BY SCIENTIFIC METHOD&quot;</i>,

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Fiorentine's conclusions are totally unwarranted and are based solely
on his assumption of a desired cause and effect relationship between
going to meetings and sobriety, not the facts.
<p>
That is, he just wishes that A.A. or N.A. meetings really worked.
His &quot;statistical analysis&quot; is worthless because he assumes
that the numbers show that 12-Step meetings cause abstinence, rather
than that the desire to be sober and unaddicted causes meeting attendance.
Fiorentine confuses correlation with cause and effect.
<p>
And it was really outrageous to claim that &quot;the scientific
method&quot; had proved the effectiveness of 12-Step meetings.
Claudia Voyles titled her article:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;12 STEP POWER SHOWN BY SCIENTIFIC METHOD&quot;</i></font>.<br>

There is no truth to that statement. None whatsoever.
That was not a valid scientific test.
There was no &quot;scientific method&quot; in any of Fiorentine's deceptive propaganda.
There was no control group with which to compare the Twelve-Step Facilitation
groups, to see what effect the so-called &quot;treatment&quot; and
the 12-Step meetings actually had &#8212; to see whether the &quot;treatment&quot;
really improved on Mother Nature.

The proper way to do such a medical study or scientific experiment
is a &quot;Longitudinal Controlled Study&quot;.
How you do that is get, say, 200 or 2000 convicted drunk drivers or
other alcoholics from a traffic court or a hospital,
all of whom have been determined to be alcohol abusers by a doctor or
competent therapist, and then divide them, randomly, into two equal groups.
Send the first group to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and do nothing with the second group.
Let them go home. Let them drink all they want.
They are &quot;the control group&quot;.
Give them no &quot;treatment&quot; or punishment of any kind.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">(It's fair. Getting <i>no treatment</i> &#8212; being a guinea
pig in a scientific experiment &#8212; <i>IS</i> their punishment.)</font>
<p>
In order for any &quot;treatment&quot; or program to claim success, it must do
significantly better than the control group.

<p>
At the end of the test, at 6 months or a year or two later, count and
measure all of them, to see how many are still drinking destructively.
Compare the A.A. group to the no-treatment group, to see
what the effect of A.A. really was.
<p>
Every time <i>that</i> experiment has been done,
the results were that A.A. didn't work at all, and had no good long-term effects.
In fact, the A.A.-treated group
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank"><i>did worse</i></a> than

Likewise, the statement that<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Regular 12 Step attendance made the difference, prompting the
conclusion that 12 Step meetings work well...&quot;</font><br>
is groundless and untrue. Fiorentine merely assumed that 12-Step meetings made a difference.
The evidence does not support that conclusion.

<p>
Nevertheless, the citation for Fiorentine's article says:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;A recent study confirms that weekly participation in 12-Step programs,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Note the word game where it says that 12-Step meetings &quot;help&quot; people
maintain abstinence. They imply cause-and-effect, but don't say it outright,
because they can't. There is simply no evidence of any cause-and-effect relationship
between going to 12-Step meetings and abstaining from alcohol and drugs.
<p>
We also got a demonstration of the propaganda technique called
&quot;<a href="#qualifiers">Lying With Qualifiers</a>&quot; there.
It said that A.A. meetings &quot;helped&quot; people to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;maintain their abstinence for up to two years&quot;</font>.
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Up to two years?</i>
</font>
So does that mean that lots of the &quot;meeting makers&quot; relapsed at the one month point, and
more at two months, and more at three, and more at six, etc.?
And the very last clean and sober hold-out relapsed at the two-year point?
Yes, unfortunately, that must be what it really means, because that's what

<h3>Intelligent humans evolved because of big-hipped ancestors<br>
Intelligent humans developed because our female ancestors had wide hips which allowed them to give birth to babies with big brains, according to new research.</h3>

<p>

By Nick Allen<br>
Last Updated: 9:13PM GMT 13 Nov 2008<br>
<br>
The hips of females from the species Homo erectus, a primitive relative of modern humans, have been found to be wider than was previously thought.<br>
<br>
That means they were well equipped for delivering babies with a larger cranial capacity which ultimately allowed intelligent human beings to evolve.<br>
...<br>
Scientists came to their conclusion after reconstructing a 1.2 million-year-old fossil pelvis discovered in Gona, Ethiopia.<br>
...<br>
A narrow pelvis for females would have caused infants to be born with relatively small brains.

<p>
That is the exact opposite of the truth. The reality is:
<ol>
<p><li> Pre-human ape-men
evolved larger brains and higher intelligence in order to survive.
The stupid ones either starved or got eaten by lions and tigers,
leaving the smarter ones, with bigger brains, to reproduce.
(Hint: the ones who were intelligent enough to use clubs, tomahawks, and spears
to defend themselves from the predators lived a lot longer. And having the
brains to build a fire was a life-saver in cold winters.)
So gradually, human intelligence and human brains both increased in size.

<p><li> Then, the females with wider hips were able to deliver such larger-headed babies without
complications, while the narrowest-hipped females died in childbirth.
<p><li> The wider-hipped females gave birth to more wider-hipped daughters,
and the process repeated itself, with the narrowest-hipped females
continuing to die in childbirth, and the wider-hipped ones surviving.
<p><li> Carry that process forwards a million years, and you will get a population where
all of the females have wide hips.
</ol>

<p>
Later in the article, the author finally got his logic straightened out:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The need to give birth to large brained infants was probably the primary driver behind the shape of the pelvis.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses this logical error constantly:
<ol>
<p><li> They routinely infer that A.A. meeting attendance causes sobriety,
rather than that the desire for sobriety causes some people to attend some A.A. meetings.
(The same desire for sobriety also causes people to quit drinking alcohol.)

<p><li> A.A. infers that doing the 12 Steps causes people to quit drinking, rather
than that quitting drinking causes some people to do the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Most of the A.A. members who are actually continously sober
really quit drinking before they did the 12 Steps &#8212; and often,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Robertson_already_quit" target="_blank">they quit drinking before they
even attended very many A.A. meetings</a>.

(Many alcoholics quit drinking in a detox center, which then sends them to A.A. meetings, and
then A.A. takes the credit for the sobriety.)

<p><li> Again, the desire for sobriety causes some people to waste their time
practicing some useless &quot;steps&quot; of an old cult religion.
The 12 Steps do not cause people to desire sobriety.

The <i>Straw Man</i> technique is a stunt where you prop up an
easy-to-defeat opponent, like a Straw Man, and then attack him
and knock him down, to make yourself look big, strong, and victorious.
<p>
For example, politicians and District Attorney candidates running for election brag that
they will &quot;prosecute sexual predators to the full extent of the law.&quot; But that is what
all of the politicians do. Nobody likes sexual predators. They don't get
any easy treatment. It isn't like the other candidate is &quot;soft on sexual predators&quot;.

<p>
Similarly, you can attack a caricature of what
the other person said, rather than arguing against what he actually said.

Nan Robertson used a flavor of the Straw Man trick in her book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Robertson" target="_blank">
<i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i></a>.
While arguing for the disease theory of alcoholism, she propped up
a few reasons why alcoholism should not be called a disease
and then knocked them down, and then felt that she had made her point:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li> Moral and social objections: &quot;How can the habit of opening
ones mouth and pouring alcohol down one's throat be called a disease?&quot;
<li> Objections that the disease concept interferes with recovery &#8212; it
provides patients with a ready-made excuse: &quot;Don't blame me, I'm sick&quot;.
<li> Political and social objections &#8212; If alcoholism is a disease,
it should be treated by doctors, not amateurs.<br>
<font size="-1" face="Times,Roman,Sanserif">
(See <i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Nan Robertson, pages 196-197.)</font>
</ul>
</font>
<p>
Nan Robertson dismissed all of those arguments with a paragraph each, and then concluded
that alcoholism was a disease.
<ul>
<li>
All that Nan Robertson did was dispute <i>some other people's objections to calling
alcoholism a disease</i>.
<li>
She did not prove that alcoholism was a disease, or even produce
any good evidence that there is any such disease as alcoholism.
<li>
What Nan Robertson missed in her broken logic is the simple fact that,
even if it was okay, in Nan Robertson's mind,
for alcoholism to be called a disease, that still did not make it an
actual disease.<br>
It's just like:
<font color="blue">
<i>Even if it is okay, in the minds of some superstitious people,
for the world to be called &quot;flat&quot;,
that still does not make the world really flat.</i></font>

Another example: From the &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, we learn that
Bill Wilson was only able to convert brain-damaged morons and
pathetic cry-babies to the new Alcoholics Anonymous religion.
Wilson used the straw-man tactic constantly,
portraying non-believers and the unconverted as the most pathetic
self-pitying stupid
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudiced fools</a>
who were unable to see the truth</a> until the brilliant,
wonderful Bill Wilson came along and saved them from their stupidity.
This quote is from the &quot;Man On The Bed&quot; story in the <i>Big Book</i>,
where Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were allegedly recruiting for A.A. in the hospital:
<p>
<font color="#blue"><i>

<b>A Peek Into Twenty-First-Century Medicine</b>
</center>
<p>
The healing power of the spirit, exemplified by the success of the
Twelve Steps program in helping overcome a variety of addictions, will
be harnessed more fully to treat a wider range of medical problems.
<p>
Lawyers boast that when their professional forebears were writing
the Constitution and organizing the Supreme Court, doctors were
still bleeding patients to remove ill humors and using leeches as
medical apparatus.
<p>
As medicine moved out of its primitive beginnings and joined the
revolution in science, it is easy to understand why the spiritual
dimension of healing was absent from serious discussion. Spirituality,
with its nebulous connotation, sounded too much like the folk traditions
of another era and did not have the clarity of the surgeon's knife
or the pharmacist's pill.
Today, however, it is only because medicine
is on a firm scientific basis that the spiritual dimension of healing
can be fairly evaluated. Although modern medicine has been slow to
take up the challenge, this healing factor is now too obvious to ignore.<br>
...<br>
The field of medicine is still in its infancy in understanding the
spiritual dimension of healing.
But it is clear that the power of the
mind and the spirit to overcome both chronic and acute medical problems
is real.
In the twenty-first century, this healing force can be harnessed more
fully and effectively through scientific persistence and spiritual
growth within the discipline of medicine.<br>

The author has a bone to pick with modern doctors. He is angry with
them because they won't agree with his ideas of &quot;spiritual
healing.&quot; So he declares, essentially:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>The reason that modern medicine refuses to approve of
&quot;spiritual medicine&quot;, faith healing, and magical
&quot;Twelve-Step therapy&quot; is because contemporary doctors are
still just as blind, stupid, and slow to learn as they were 200 years ago,
and they have still hardly gotten beyond using leeches and blood-letting.</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is quite untrue, of course. Modern medicine is very good,
and is far beyond stupidly using voodoo medicine,
which is what the author of that quote wants to shove on us.
<p>
The author recites the faults of ancient medical practice
in order to make current medical practice look bad, because
he can't fault contemporary doctors.
<i>If you can't attack today's doctors as stupid, then attack the ones who
lived 225 years ago. They are easy to criticize and ridicule and knock down.</i>
That's the Straw Man tactic.

<p>
And the author lies and grossly distorts the facts as well: People
studied and tried faith healing and spiritual medicine for thousands of years.
It was all they had, so they really wished that it would work.
It took us a very long time before we finally learned some things
that actually work properly, and what actually works is penicillin,
streptomycin, and tetracycline, not occult incantations, prayers,
chants, charms, voodoo dolls, magic spells, throwing virgin girls into volcanos,
or sacrificing your first-born son on the alter to appease an angry God.
<p>
And the author also misuses the word &quot;spiritual&quot;. <b>Bill Wilson
constantly confused psychological, emotional, and spiritual things</b>,
and so does this faithful follower of his.
(Bill made grand, sweeping proclamations like that all forms of
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">spiritual diseases</a>&quot;
were caused by &quot;resentments&quot;
<font size="-1">&#8212; the <i>Big Book</i>, page 64.</font>)
What isn't obvious from the quote above
(<a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">see the larger review</a>) is that
the author would talk about things like how people having a positive mental
attitude towards their recovery from illness coincided with people
rapidly healing what ailed them, and
then the author would call that &quot;spiritual healing.&quot;
That isn't spiritual healing; that's just psychology. That's just
having a good mind-set &#8212; a positive and cheerful attitude. And that positive attitude
was often caused by the patient's rapid recovery, rather than the rapid
recovery being caused by the positive attitude...
That is <i>&quot;Confusion of Correlation and Causation&quot;</i> again.
<p>

And last but not least, the author also gave a good demonstration of
the <a href="#big_lie">Big Lie technique</a>. That quote is just loaded
with Big Lies:
<ol>
<li> &quot;'The healing power of the spirit' is an established fact.&quot;

<li> &quot;The spiritual dimension of healing is an established fact.&quot;

For just one example of modern medicine embracing &quot;spiritual

people can and do have their own spiritual healing
ceremonies performed for them in hospitals. They get both the medicine

Another, much less positive, example of so-called &quot;spiritual healing&quot; is this:
Here in Portland Oregon there is a fundamentalist sect of people who call themselves
 &quot;The Church of the Followers of Christ&quot;. They
do not believe in doctors or medicine. They only believe in prayer
and &quot;spiritual healing&quot;. When one of their children gets sick,
they pray over the child, and they absolutely will not take the sick
child to a doctor or a hospital. If the child dies, he dies.
They declare that it must be the Will of God. Every few years, they kill
another child that way.
<p>
Just recently, in May 2010, the parents of one of their dead children were tried for
manslaughter, and convicted.  The father got two years in prison. The mother got off
with probation so that she could care for the surviving children.
And then, just a few months later, that crazy congregation killed another child
the same way. So now <i>those</i> parents are being charged with manslaughter. This has been
going on for many years.
<p>
The big flaw in their logic is that they are actually so arrogant and delusional
that they think they are powerful magicians. They imagine that their prayers are
working magical ceremonies. They think that they can summon
spiritual powers and magical forces just by incanting some holy names
like &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;.
That is actually no different from a sourcerer who imagines that he can
get magical powers by summoning up demons by name.
<p>
Obviously, their magic is not working very well. (Although they believe that it is:
most of the time, the children do recover while being prayed for. Their children's recovery rate
from childhood diseases and the common cold is especially good.)

The same thing happened just down the road in Albany, Oregon, where
<a href="orange-letters265.html#Followers" target="_blank">
another pair of parents were found guilty of killing their child by &quot;faith healing&quot;</a>.
Members of a local nut-case church, &quot;The Church of the First-Born&quot;,
do not believe in taking their sick children to a doctor. They insist on
relying solely on prayer and waiting for the Lord to fix things.
<p>
In this case, the prosecutor declared that a 12-year-old girl died from
untreated diabetes, and the girl could have lived if the parents had gotten
the girl medical treatment. The minimum sentence for the death is 10 years,
and both parents were sentenced to 10 years.  At the sentencing, the parents
cried that they never meant to hurt their daughter.  Their two other children
will live with friends of the family. (Which probably means other church members.)

I wonder when the courts will start convicting A.A. sponsors for such quackery.

I notice that such use of prayer is a lame attempt at magic. The people who are
praying imagine that they are skilled wizards who have such great magical powers
that they can get whatever they want by incanting a spell that begins,
&quot;Dear God, please gimme, gimme, gimme...&quot;
<p>
Now of course they will never use the words &quot;wizard&quot; or &quot;magic&quot;
&#8212; they will say that would be &quot;black magic&quot; or &quot;sorcery&quot; &#8212;
but they still believe that they can get magical results by casting spells that
they call &quot;prayers&quot;.

<p>
Alas, they never studied with Harry Potter and Hermione, or graduated from Hogwart.
<p>
And isn't it funny how, if you incant, &quot;In the name of Satan and Baelzebub
and all of the Demons of Darkness, I command you to give me...&quot;, that is
&quot;Black Magic&quot; and &quot;Demonology&quot;?
<p>
But if you incant, &quot;In the name of God and Jesus and all of the Angels,
I beg you to give me...&quot;, then that is &quot;pious religion&quot; and
&quot;proper God-fearing behavior&quot;.
<p>
Apparently, it's just a matter of which spirits you invoke to do your bidding.
Making Satan your servant is bad, but making Jesus your servant is good.

<p>
(I guess we are supposed to simply ignore the fact that it is collosally
arrogant for someone to imagine that he can make God or Jesus do his bidding.
If God really has a Divine Plan, then I don't think that God needs humans
telling Him to change the Divine Plan to suit them.)

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This world of ours has made more material progress in the
last century than in all the millenniums which went before. Almost
everyone knows the reason. Students of
ancient history tell us that the intellect of men in those days
was equal to the best of today. Yet in ancient times material
progress was painfully
slow. The spirit of modern scientific inquiry, research
and invention was almost unknown.  In the realm of the
material, men's minds were fettered by superstition,
tradition, and all sorts of fixed ideas.  Some of the
contemporaries of Columbus thought a round earth
preposterous.  Others came near putting Galileo to
death for his astronomical heresies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just
as biased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit
as were the ancients about the realm of the
material?<br>

That is when the speaker (Bill Wilson) suddenly slips a lie into the

The last sentence is an irrational appeal to embrace the very evils,
the narrow-minded blind faith, the superstitious &quot;spirituality&quot;
and &quot;the realm of the spirit&quot; that the previous sentences
had so properly criticized.

to say that &quot;the ancients&quot; were
&quot;biased and unreasonable&quot; about the
&quot;realm of the material.&quot; They weren't. The medieval Roman Catholic
Church authorities were far more &quot;biased and unreasonable&quot;
about the &quot;realm of the spirit.&quot;
They would not tolerate any &quot;spiritual&quot;, religious, or
philosophical ideas that were different from their own. They asserted
that they and the Bible had all of the true answers about everything
in the world,
and anyone who disagreed with them the least little bit was evil and
doing the work of the Devil and trying to lead people to Hell.
Their inquisitions ran for centuries, and killed a lot of people.
One of the commonest reasons for a death sentence and burning at the stake

<li> Slippery slope &#8212; another subset of the excluded middle &#8212; make

What Frank Buchman didn't bother to say there is that those who
&quot;chose to be governed by God&quot; were really supposed
to be governed by Frank and his lieutenants. The Buchmanites claimed that they,

they, were &quot;sane&quot; and &quot;Guided by God&quot;, Frank said, and everybody
else was &quot;insane&quot;. So, if you were &quot;Guided by God&quot;, then you
would do what Frank told you to do...

In 1943, Frank Buchman declared:

<li> A.A. defenders say, &quot;You can't criticize our program unless you have a perfect,
fool-proof, never-fails program of your own to offer as an
alternative.&quot;<br>
<font color="blue">
Translation: &quot;Either show us a perfect program of your own design,
or else accept our goofy program.&quot;
</font>


<p>
<li>
A.A. promoters ask,
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Which would you rather get treatment and advice from &#8212;
your old drinking buddies, or AA members?&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
(For me, the answer is, &quot;Neither.&quot; Try finding someone who is sane and reasonable and
who knows what he is talking about, like a doctor who is good at treating addictions.)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
And even people who are trying to be objective can get caught in traps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Either addiction is a disease and addicts are powerless over their addictions, or else
addiction is a choice and addicts can stop any time they want to.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Such an argument ignores the middle possibility: that
physical addiction to a chemical really messes with the addict's mind and makes
quitting extremely difficult (but not impossible).
Sometimes, it is true that an addict can quit any time he wants to &#8212; he just
cannot &quot;want to&quot; intensely enough to overcome the urges, the cravings,
the crazyness, and the pain that inevitably accompanies withdrawal.

(That is, he can't &quot;want to enough&quot; until something extreme
happens to motivate him, like getting sick unto death,
nearly dying, or seeing a friend die. Then that can be the stimulus that provides the
motivation to finally quit and stay quit.)
</ul>

<p><br>
<a name="dichotomy"> </a>
<li> <b>False Dichotomy</b><br>
<p>
The <i>False Dichotomy</i> technique is very similar to the <i>Either/Or</i> technique.
A dichotomy is the division of something into two pieces. A false dichotomy is an
attempt to divide something with a false dividing line, like:
<ol>
<li> You can have either quantity, or quality, but not both.
<li> Some people vote for God, and some people vote Democratic.
<li> Some people support the troops, while others want to end the war.
<li> Some people support President Bush, while others are not so patriotic.
<li> Unwanted fertilized human eggs should be adopted, not used for stem cell research.<br>

<ul>
<font color="blue"><i>
{That statement implies that it is an either/or choice, and ignores the
fact that there are 400,000 unwanted embryos in freezers around the U.S.A., extras
left over from <b>in vitro</b> fertization procedures,
and very, very, very few of them will ever get adopted and become &quot;Snowflake Babies&quot;.
So far, only 81 of them have ever been adopted.
There really are not a lot of women around who are begging the doctors to shove somebody else's
fertilized egg into their wombs.
There are more than enough unwanted frozen embryos to go around,
and the sad truth is that almost all of those embryos will end up getting flushed down the
drain after they have sat in the freezer for too long. They get freezer burn too, you know.}
</i></font>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>
Variations on False Dichotomy include:
<ul>
<li> False Dilemma: The choice presented is only A or B. Rejecting A is selecting B.
<li> Bifurcation
<li> Either/Or: Reduce reality to, "Either this is true, or that is true." 
<li> The Enemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend
<li> Hobson's Choice
<li> Alternative Advance
</ul>

<p>
Another very common false dichotomy is:
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;Do you believe in God or evolution?&quot;</b>
</font>
<br>
But if you believe that evolution was God's method of creating us, then there is no conflict
between science and religion. Yes there is a God, and yes, evolution is true.

<p>
<blockquote>
The only conflict is between modern observations of reality and the
superstitions of some ill-educated Israeli goat-herders
who happened to live in the Sinai Desert 4000 years ago.
But what did they know? They thought that the Earth was flat, and that
the Firmament was a black dome over the Earth, to which all of the stars were glued.
(Read the beginning of <i>Genesis</i>, and the part of <i>Revelations</i>
where the Lord rolls up the Firmament like a Venetian blind and takes it away. There goes
the night sky and all of the stars that are glued to it.)
</blockquote>
<p>
Al Shebab is a terrorist gang in Somalia that is linked to Al Qaeda.
They recently carried out a terrorist attack on a shopping mall in Kenya
that killed 70 people.
OPB Newshour, 2014.01.07, did an article on Al Shebab.
In it, an Al Shebab leader Sheik Ali Dehere lectured new suicide mission recruits:
<font color="green">
&quot;When we fight and are martyred, we are hoping to be with God in Paradise.
We are hoping for beautiful women.  What do the infidels hope for? Nothing.&quot;
</font>
<br>
That is a false dichotomy. People who are not murdering terrorists hope for many things, generally
good things. They might even hope to go to Heaven.
And people who choose to not be murdering terrorists are not necessarily &quot;infidels&quot;.
That is a <i>Sheep and Goats</i> distinction.

<p>
George Bush uses the false dichotomy technique constantly, framing an argument as a choice
between two irrelevant things.
While talking about the armed insurgents in Iraq, he said that they had to &quot;choose between
freedom or a return to darkness.&quot;
(23 Aug 2005).
The insurgents are not opposed to freedom. They are opposed to the occupation
of their country by the United States Army.
In fact, those insurgents want to be even freer than they are now, so
that they can do whatever they want to do without interference from Americans.

Recently, Tom Cruise appeared on television to promote the movie <i>War of the Worlds</i>.
Somehow, the interview morphed into a tirade against modern psychiatry, and criticism
of psychiatrists for giving tranquilizers to adults and psychotropic drugs to children.
He voiced many bitter denunciations of modern psychiatry.
Cruise claimed that &quot;You don't know the history of psychiatry like I do.&quot;
Cruise also said that he believes that Scientology offers a valid alternative to current psychiatric
practices.
<p>
But Tom Cruise is making the whole issue into a false <i>Either/Or</i> choice &#8212; a
false dichotomy.
Is isn't <i><b>EITHER</b></i> modern psychiatry is right,
<i><b>OR</b></i> Scientology is right.
Cruise ignores the obvious possibility that both could be wrong:<br>
<ul>
<li> Some psychiatrists are very much at fault for prescribing entirely
too many medications &#8212; especially Ritalin &#8212; to children just because
they are high-energy little live-wires (which a lot of healthy children are).
Sitting still in a classroom all day long, year after year, is downright unnatural and unhealthy,
and drugging children to make them be quiet is despicable.

and cruel rip-off &#8212; just organized crime masquerading as a healing group.

Bill Wilson's favorite false dichotomy was to divide people into those &quot;faithful&quot;
people who believed the crazy dogmatic things that he was preaching,
and the &quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">atheists and agnostics</a>&quot; who didn't.
<p>
And, some alcoholics accepted all of Bill's bull, while others were
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">unreasoningly prejudiced</a>&quot;.
<p>
And then A.A. teaches us that there are:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) those good A.A. members who <i>Keep Coming Back</i> to more A.A.
meetings and <i>Work The Steps</i> in all of their affairs; and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) those unfortunates who will die drunk in a gutter.
<p>
And,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Good A.A. members are able to grasp a lifestyle that requires
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#honesty" target="_blank">rigorous honesty</a>&quot;
(like <i>Fake It Till You Make It</i> and <i>Act As If</i>), while<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Non-members are &quot;constitutionally incapable of being

<a name="enemy_of_enemy"> </a>
<li> <b>The Enemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend</b><br>

<p>
Variations:
<ul>
<li>
<i>&quot;The enemy of bad must be good.&quot;</i><br>

Those are obviously false assumptions, fraught with dangers.
Nobody is absolutely bad, or absolutely good, so their enemy
cannot be absolutely the opposite, either. Even Heinrich Himmler, the man who
personally managed the halocaust that murdered 6 million
Jews, had a soft spot in his heart for pretty little girls, and he doted on them and would
pick wild flowers for them. But that didn't make those little girls bad, or our enemies.
<p>
Adolf Hitler hated Joe Stalin, and was totally opposed to what Joe was
doing, but that didn't make Stalin a good guy. Both Adolf Hitler and
Joseph Stalin were world-class murdering monsters.
<p>
Peter Howard used this technique to try to claim that the Oxford Group
/ Moral Re-Armament organization was good. He claimed that he had a secret
Gestapo report on the Oxford Groups that the Gestapo had printed during
World War II, which condemned the Oxford Groups as a dangerous influence,
and ordered Gestapo agents to watch them closely.
Thus, Howard concluded, the Oxford Groups must be virtuous, and the
allegations that the Oxford Groups were essentially a fascist cult
religion must be false.
That is bad logic.
The leader of the Gestapo, Heinrich Himmler, was against <i>all</i>
Christian churches, because they encouraged people to be loyal to
something other than Adolf Hitler.
Also, Himmler dismissed all of Christianity as a &quot;Jewish&quot;
religion, and wanted to stamp it out and
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#Himmler_pagan" target="_blank">return to ancient paganism</a>.
So Himmler was wary of the Oxford Groups just because they said that
they were Christian
(<a href="orange-rroot450.html#not_Christian" target="_blank">which they were not,
really, in the final analysis</a>).
<p>
Scientology routinely uses a variation on this tactic.
Scientology opposes the use of all psychiatric drugs and medications,
claiming that Scientology procedures are the only valid treatment
for psychiatric problems.
Scientologists especially like to complain about children being overmedicated
with harmful drugs like Ritalin.
Like most successful Big Lies, there is a grain of truth in such complaints.
It is despicable to overmedicate children and dope them out just because they
are energetic little live wires who don't want to sit still in classrooms
when the sun is out and it's a beautiful day outside.
But Scientology way overdoes it in opposing all psychiatric medications.
And then they use the logical fallacy of &quot;we oppose something bad so
that proves that we are good.&quot;
<p>
And then they go on and on, denouncing drug after drug, finding fault with
every tranquilizer and anti-psychotic around, picketing and warning against
Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox, Celexa, Lexapro, Seroxat, Prozac, Effextor, 
etc., and all the while claiming that they great because they
are saving people from the bad psychiatrists. And the more they can find
wrong with medications or psychiatrists, the more convinced they are that
they are right about everything.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses this ploy constantly by declaring, &quot;Alcoholism is very bad, so A.A.,
which opposes alcoholism, is very good.&quot;
<p>
The so-called &quot;recovery industry&quot; uses this ploy by declaring that they are very opposed
to &quot;addiction&quot;, implying that they are good people who are dedicated
to helping others, rather than just charlatons with ineffective quack cures
who are out to get your money.
Their advertisements go on and on, ranting about how bad &quot;addiction&quot; is, without actually
showing that they are doing anything good for the problem.

thing offered, or get nothing.

<p>
The A.A. program is often offered in this manner: Either accept the entire program
and believe all of it, or else get no help: &quot;If you aren't willing to accept this Program,
then you should go out and do some more research on the subject.&quot;

In A.D. 640, when the Saracens captured Alexandria, seat of

A.A. uses this stunt by offering a choice of membership in a cult religion,

<blockquote>

To one who feels he is an

alternatives to face.<br>

<a name="ftnt23_ret"> </a>
<a name="syllogism"> </a>
<li> <b>Faulty Syllogism</b><br>
A <i>Faulty Syllogism</i> is bad logic, pure and simple &#8212; a bad
chain of logical deduction.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Technically, a proper syllogism is an argument, the conclusion of which is supported by
two premises, of which one (major premise) contains the term (major term)
that is the predicate of the conclusion, and the other (minor premise)
contains the term (minor term) that is the subject of the conclusion; common
to both premises is a term (middle term) that is excluded from the conclusion.
A typical form is: &quot;All A is B; all B is C; therefore all A is
C.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt23">23</a></sup></font><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whew! A simpler and clearer example of a good syllogism is like this:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
&quot;All Pekinese ducks are white.<br>
Mister Lee is a Pekinese duck.<br>
Therefore Mister Lee is white.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
A faulty syllogism might be something like this:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-thinker.html" target="_blank">You think as much as college professors,
and college professors don't make any money, so if you keep on thinking
we won't have any money!</a>&quot;
</font>

<p>
Another rather popular faulty syllogism is this:
<font color="blue">
<ol>
<li> A young, aspiring poet has his poems panned, trashed, or ignored by the critics.
<li> That young poet recalls that many of the greatest poets were also
panned, trashed, or ignored by the critics when they were young.
<li> &quot;Therefore,&quot; the young poet concludes, &quot;I must also be one
of the great poets.&quot;
</ol>
</font>
<p>
Obviously, the flaw in the logic is to overlook the simple truth that for every
young genius artist who gets panned by the critics, there are a hundred incompetents
who <i>really should be</i> trashed by the critics.

<p>
A variation on that faulty syllogism is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, John Bellushi and James Dean all died young, and
they were all great artists.

And conversely, what about all of the great old artists?

&quot;I supported terrorists today. I thought I was just having fun,
but I gave money to terrorists. I drove my car down to the gas
station and filled up the tank, and went cruising.
But the gas station sent the money to Bush's and Cheney's friends' oil
companies, who sent the money to Saudi Arabia, which gave the
money to the bin Laden family, who gave some of the money to
Osama, who gave it to his terrorist guys.
So I supported terrorists when I bought gasoline
today.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt12">12</a></sup></font>

Likewise, this old argument is completely illogical:
At the dinner table, a mother tells her child, &quot;Finish your peas. There are children

A commercial on PBS for a big financial company tells the story of a couple of
university professors who put their children through college. The wife
stops the narrator and says:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;You don't build up a big nest egg on a couple of teachers' salaries.
You need a plan and a financial consultant who isn't afraid to roll
up his sleeves.&quot;</font><br>
That is nonsense, another <i>non sequitur</i>.
Obviously, unless that couple robbed a bank or inherited a fortune or
took bribes from their students for good grades, they <i>really did</i>
build up their big nest egg on a couple of teachers' salaries.

<p>
Swami Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness
 &#8212;  the &quot;Hari Krishnas&quot;  &#8212;  used this <i>non sequitur</i> while recruiting new followers:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Everyone must bow down before something. You cannot help but bow down before death. You cannot refuse death.
When death comes, you cannot say, 'No, I will not bow down to you.' So you must
choose, what will you bow down to?&quot;
</font>
Prabhupada then argued that people should bow down to &quot;Krishna&quot;, which really meant bowing down to him, because
they could not resist death. Prabhupada declared that bowing down to his teachings was better than
&quot;bowing down to death&quot;, and Prabhupada implied that bowing down to him and becoming one of his
followers was somehow an alternative to death. That is a complete <i>non sequitur</i>. There is no logic to it.
Someone could argue with equal validity that you should bow down to the cosmic wisdom of
 Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse because you cannot avoid dying sooner or later.

Frank Buchman's <i>Oxford Group</i> cult
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#Vic_Kitchen_6" target="_blank">came up with this jewel</a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
'I most hate self, because &quot;I&quot; is the middle letter of SIN.'<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
(By that brain-damaged <i>Oxford Group</i> logic &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f"><i>'&quot;I&quot; is the middle letter of SIN'</i></font> &#8212;
they should have also hated <i>Saints</i> and <i>Salvation</i>,
because &quot;S&quot; is the first letter of SIN.
And perhaps they should also hate Nuts and Noodles, because &quot;N&quot;

<p>
Another <i>Non Sequitur</i>, or piece of broken logic,
is Carl Sagan's old favorite:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;There aren't any aliens out there. We have been looking for
them for 50 years, and we haven't seen any. We would have seen them
or made contact or something by now, if they existed.&quot;<br>
</font>
Carl Sagan's answer is:
<i>&quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;</i><br>
In particular, we have explored only the most minuscule part of
our Universe, maybe something like only a quintillionth of one percent
or less.
Even our best telescopes cannot even see the planets orbiting the
nearest neighboring stars, so how could we see their spaceships?
(Really. We compute the existence of distant planets by watching how the
stars wobble a tiny bit as the invisible planets orbit them.)
It's outrageously premature to declare
that there is nobody out there, just because we haven't seen them yet.
<p>
It's kind of like going down to the seashore, and sucking up a
drop of water in an eye-dropper, and then looking very closely
at the drop, and announcing,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I don't see any whales in there.
Obviously, whales don't really exist.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Another popular one is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Drafting people and forcing them to serve in the army isn't slavery
because everybody is subjected to it.&quot;<br>
</font>
Of course it's slavery. Whether something is slavery or not has nothing to do
with how many people are enslaved.<br>
(By the way, not everybody was subjected to it. Rich men's sons got college deferments
and ended up avoiding the draft.
Dick Cheney got five deferments because he said he &quot;had other priorities.&quot;)

In a TV commercial for the Turbo-Tax&#174; computer program (2004.01.20),
the husband asks,
<font color="blue">
&quot;What if we made a mistake?&quot;</font><br>
His wife confidently answers,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The calculations are guaranteed accurate.&quot;</font><br>
That is brain-damaged logic, a real <i>non-sequitur</i>.
The husband asked &quot;What if <i>we</i>
made a mistake?&quot;, not &quot;What if the computer program made a mistake?&quot;...<br>
Sure, the computer's basic calculations like addition and multiplication
will be accurate, but that doesn't guarantee that
the humans haven't messed everything up. You know the old saying,
<i>&quot;Garbage In, Garbage Out&quot;</i>.<br>
The Turbo-Tax guys cannot guarantee against human error. The reason that it is
so hard to make things fool-proof is because fools are so damned clever at thinking
of new ways to screw things up.

<p>
American Express has a commercial on TV that is similarly illogical.
A man who declares that he works as a waiter in a restaurant and also
coaches childrens' basketball explains that,
<blockquote>

In another brain-damaged <i>non sequitur</i>, G. W. Bush tells the troops:

<i>&quot;It is wonderful to bravely, patriotically, serve your country
and fight terrorism. I am committed to fighting terrorism.
Some of you may die in this war, but that is a sacrifice that I am
willing to make. Bring 'em on!&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
The supporters of George W. Bush insist that having investigations to discover the truth
behind Bush's many, many mistakes, deceptions, and false statements regarding the war in
Iraq would not be good for America:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We can't discover the truth right now; we are in a war against terrorism.&quot;<br>
</font>
That is a <i>non sequitur</i>.
<p>
Recently (Nov. 22, 2006) the elder George Bush was in Dubai,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161130003614/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1122-08.htm" target="_blank">where he was harshly criticized</a>
for the foreign policy of the United States and the military adventurism
of his son. Papa Bush responded,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;How come everybody wants to come to the United States if the
United States is so bad?&quot;
</font>
That is a <i>non sequitur</i>. There are many good reasons for wanting
to come to the United States which do not imply approval of George W.'s
bombing and invasion of Afghanistan and Iraqi, or his policy of unquestioning
support of Israel. One good reason for coming to the USA is to get away
from American bombing in Afghanistan or Iraq.
Another good reason is to get away from American-trained death squads in military
dictatorships around the world.

Another <i>non sequitur</i>: a cult old-timer declares,

This <i>non sequitur</i> might be called &quot;proof by delusion&quot;:

Paul Krugman reported a crazy non-sequitur recently:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Consider one of Mr. Romney’s most famous remarks: "Corporations are people,
my friend." When the audience jeered, he elaborated: "Everything corporations
earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it goes? Whose pockets?
Whose pockets? People’s pockets." This is undoubtedly true, once you take into
account the pockets of, say, partners at Bain Capital (who, I hasten to add,
are, indeed, people).<br>

<p>
The fact that people get money from corporations does not mean that corporations <i>are</i> people,
entitled to human rights, like freedom of speech or the right to vote.
Corporations cannot be imprisoned for their crimes, can they? Or be given the death sentence for
polluting children to death. Or die of old age. Or get cancer. Or bleed and suffer.
Corporations are actually just legal fictions that allow some people to do business without
being liable for the consequences of their actions.
If the same people do busness as a partnership, they can be put in prison for their crimes.

Today, commercials on the radio tell you that you need to join Al-Anon or Ala-Teen

&quot;We are the family and friends of alcoholics.
We may be different, but we have one thing in common:
We want our lives back.&quot;<br></font>
</blockquote>

The broken logic there is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Daddy drinks too much alcohol, and living with him is a nightmare, so you need to
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#ACOA2" target="_blank">go join the 12-Step cult religion</a>

find your part in it and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">quit being so selfish
and quit being such a domineering bitch</a>.&quot;<br>
</font>
That's a real <i>non sequitur</i> &#8212; there is no logic to it.

<p>
For another example of bad logic:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Both of the co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous, William G. Wilson and
Dr. Robert Smith, were very heavy smokers. So were most of the other
early A.A. members. Bill Wilson often said that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">members did not need to
quit smoking</a>; that smoking was okay, and could even help
(in spite of the fact that it was killing him).
A coffee pot and lots of ash trays were considered the standard
essential equipment for any A.A. meeting. Therefore, smoking
lots and lots of tobacco, and drinking lots and lots of coffee, just
like Bill W. and Dr. Bob did, is perfectly okay, and it may even
help you to quit drinking alcohol, just like they did.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
(It may also help you to quit breathing,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#no_quit" target="_blank">just like they did</a>,

</font>

<p>
Another brain-dead non-sequitur:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When I went to an A.A. meeting, I was amazed to see that they
were all just like me. They really understood. For the first time,
I felt like I belonged. Therefore, Bill Wilson was a total genius
and right about everything, and the Twelve Steps are the One And
Only True Path to Sobriety, Serenity, and God.&quot;

<p>
A very common argument that one often hears around the &quot;recovery community&quot;
is descriptions of the horrors of alcoholism and drug addiction being
used to glorify Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.
The logic is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholism is bad, so A.A., which is intended to save alcoholics,
is good.&quot;</font><br>

<p>
But that is just another <i>non-sequitur</i>.
That is no more logical than saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholism is bad, so Scientology is good.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="blue">
Scientology also claims to have a never-fails
cure for alcoholism and drug addiction &#8212;
an allegedly-independent organization called
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#Narconon" target="_blank">Narconon</a>.
And their magic answer is:
</font>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Give <i>all</i> of your money to Scientology for more 'auditing', and
they will fix your mind.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Just because something claims to have good intentions does not make it good.

&quot;The opposite of 'good' is good intentions.&quot;

&quot;<i>It happened after 'X', so it was caused by 'X'.</i>&quot;<br>

it was caused by...&quot;. That implies a cause-and-effect relationship where
none may exist.
<p>
The classic example of this is, &quot;The rooster's crowing makes the
sun rise: First the rooster crows, and then the sun comes up over the horizon,
so the rooster's crowing makes the sun rise.&quot;

<p>
A few more examples of false logic:
<ul>
<li> A bunch of teenage girls took sex education classes in high school,
and then got pregnant. Therefore, sex education classes make teenage
girls get pregnant. The classes give the girls ideas.<br>
<font color="blue">
The fact that young females have been managing to get pregnant for
hundreds of millions of years without any formal education
&#8212; using only on-the-job training &#8212; is considered irrelevant.

Tommy ignores the simple fact that most people routinely spontaneously
recover from all of their illnesses (except perhaps the last one)
without any Magic Elixir, so he has no way of knowing whether the Magic
Elixir was

<a name="reciprocity"> </a>
<li> <b>The Norm of Reciprocity</b><br>

<i>The norm of reciprocity</i> is a technique that exploits people's
natural tendency to want to repay debts.
I know that sounds unbelievably Pollyannaish, because you might
think that most people want to avoid paying debts,
but no matter how cynical you may feel about
the human race, people do have a basically cooperative nature, <i>especially
in face-to-face relationships</i>. It dates from our
days as primitive members of tribes, just cavemen, who helped each other to survive.
When one person does a favor for another, the other feels indebted, and
wants to return the favor to even out the score. Even today, there are still a few remaining
tribes who have an economic system that is just a complex web of traded
favors and debts, and they all manage to remember who owes what to whom...

<p>
The Hari Krishnas discovered that they could increase their haul of money
from airports by giving away flowers. That is, if they just tried to shake
travelers down for donations, they got rejected a lot. But when
they gave travelers
a flower, &quot;...because we love you, and you are so
beautiful...&quot;, and then
hit up the traveler for a donation, they got a lot more money.
The act of giving the flower made the traveler feel indebted
and embarrassed, and vulnerable to the request for money.

<p>
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#sankirtan" target="_blank">Then they used the same
technique for selling their Krishna books
in airports</a>: &quot;Give&quot; the book to the traveler
&quot;because he
looks so enlightened, like someone intelligent enough to appreciate
that material&quot;, and then hit him up for a big donation to finance
the printing and distribution of that cosmic wisdom...
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>The one time they pulled that stunt on me, I had just spent my last
dollar on the airplane ticket. When I finally managed to convince the
woman who was working on me that I really didn't have even just a twenty

book back out of my hands, and stomped off in frustration...
So much for how intelligent and enlightened I look... Oh well.</i>

<p><br>
<a name="guilt"> </a>
<li> <b>Guilt Induction</b><br>
Guilt is an especially powerful tool for manipulating people's minds.
<p>
A late-night TV infomercial says:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>&quot;Don't you think it's time you gave your family all of
the things that they deserve? Buy this get-rich-quick scheme
right now.&quot;</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another commercial that sells a panic button service has a woman saying,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>&quot;What if something happened to my mother?
I don't think I could forgive myself.
I'll buy her a medical alert service.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
They imply that you are neglecting your mother if you don't buy their service,
and they make you afraid of what might go wrong.
That commercial cleverly combines guilt induction with fear-mongering,
so they are using two propaganda techniques on your mind at once.

<p>
People who feel guilty are far more likely to comply with a request
than they would be if they didn't feel guilty.
Thus, making people believe that they have hurt you, and then pressing a
request for them to do something (which offers them a feeling that
they can make amends by doing something for you) is an effective
way to get people to do what you want.
<p>
Guilt induction and self-criticism (confession) sessions formed the
core of the
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#Reds" target="_blank">Red Chinese brainwashing
program</a>, and they are still used by many cults.
Edward Hunter wrote a beautiful book about the Red Chinese brainwashing
that was done to the American, British, and other United Nations
prisoners of war in North Korea during the Korean War.
He explained the mechanics of &quot;brainwashing&quot; this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Reds had found that the easiest way to subdue any group of
people was to give its members a guilt complex and then to lead
them on from self-denunciation to self-betrayal.
All that was required to put this across was a
sufficiently heartless exploitation of the essential goodness
in people, so that they would seek self-sacrifice to
compensate for their feelings of guilt. The self-sacrifice
obviously made available to them in this inside-out environment
is some form of treason.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Brainwashing, From Pavlov to Powers</i>,
Edward Hunter, page 169.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, first, the Communist guards would do something like make the
prisoners feel guilty for being
part of &quot;a rich racist society where they never cared about the fate
of the poor Negroes&quot;, and then the prisoners had to confess that in
self-criticism sessions, and then the only way to atone for such sins
was to love and praise the wonderful Chinese Communist society where
everyone was equal (but some people were more equal than others).
<p>
<font color="blue">
Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer also considered inducing
<i>&quot;a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency&quot;</i>
to be one of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">the five essential conditions</a>
for an effective mind-control or &quot;brainwashing&quot; program.
The Red Chinese guards were able to accomplish that easily, because
all of the prisoners were at the mercy of the guards, who could
punish or kill them on a whim, or for no reason at all.
</font>

<p>
Likewise, many religions and religious cults use guilt to manipulate
their members.
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">
Frank Buchman</a>'s <b>Oxford Group</b> cult refined guilt induction
to an art and a science &#8212;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#conviction" target="_blank"><b>&quot;The Five C's&quot;</b></a>
&#8212; and used it as a standard part of their recruiting scheme.
The Oxford Groups also induced a sense of powerlessness
in their victims with the doctrine that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Everyone has been defeated by sin, and is powerless
over it. Everyone is insane</i>
<font color="#9F0000">(except Frank Buchman and his lieutenants)</font>.
<i>Only 'Surrender to God'</i>
<font color="#9F0000">[Read: surrender to Frank Buchman's cult]</font>
<i>can restore one to sanity.&quot;</i></font><br>
<font color="blue">
All of Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer's
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">
five essential conditions</a> for an effective
mind-control or &quot;brainwashing&quot; program were
present in the Oxford Groups.
</font>

<p>
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_induce_guilt" target="_blank">
Guilt induction is also a big part of the Alcoholics Anonymous program.</a>
The A.A. founders Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith learned it from the Oxford Groups when they were members of that cult.
Seven of the Twelve Steps, Steps Four through Ten, dwell on
sins, <i>&quot;defects of character&quot;,
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;</i>,
offenses, people we have harmed, and wrongs &#8212; <i>&quot;the exact
nature of our wrongs.&quot;</i>
Good A.A. newcomers are supposed to do a &quot;moral inventory&quot;
and list every sin they ever committed in their whole lives, and
then confess it all to another A.A. member and God.
Then they are supposed to make another list of everybody they ever
hurt, offended, or pissed off, and they have to go apologize or
somehow &quot;make amends.&quot; And then they are supposed to repeat
that whole rigamarole for the rest of their lives.
Such constant guilt induction can be very harmful and
psychologically damaging. It even sometimes drives people to suicide.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
(And Alcoholics Anonymous also induces a sense of powerlessness
with Steps One and Two:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212; that
our lives had become unmanageable.&quot;<br>
&quot;2. [We] Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
could restore us to sanity.&quot;<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>
Implying that you are insane and you cannot heal yourself. Somebody else has to manage your life for you and restore you to sanity.<br>
</i>
</font>
</font>
With the guilt induction and inducing a sense of powerlessness, we have
two of the most important ingredients for a working brainwashing program.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Bill Wilson's mania for inducing guilt in others was so intense
that he even tried to make people feel guilty for <i>not</i> being sinners.
On page 66 of Bill's second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
Bill described all of the disgusting ways that sinners will sin and
then deny it and try to avoid confessing their sins. Then Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We who have escaped these extremes are apt to congratulate ourselves.
Yet can we? After all, hasn't it been self-interest, pure and simple,
that has enabled most of us to escape? Not much spiritual effort
is involved in avoiding excesses which will bring us punishment
anyway.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 66.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So if you don't commit a lot of sins and crimes, then you should
feel guilty for being selfish and pursuing
&quot;self-interest, pure and simple&quot;:<br>
 &#8212; You aren't really a good person, and you aren't really spiritual.<br>
 &#8212; You are just selfishly avoiding punishment.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Poor insane old Bill Wilson really did
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">hate human nature</a>.
No wonder he was a chronic depressive.
</font>

<p>
<a name="good_selfish"> </a>
<font color="blue">
That's also a good example of a
<a href="#double_bind"><i>double-bind</i></a> &#8212;
You are damned if you do, and damned if you don't:<br>
<ul>
<li> If you commit a bunch of sins and crimes,
it's because you are selfish and unspiritual.<br>
<li> If you <i>don't</i> commit a bunch of sins and crimes,
it's because you are selfish and unspiritual and just selfishly avoiding punishment.<br>
</ul>
Either way, you are too selfish to be &quot;spiritual.&quot;
So you should start doing Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps, listing and
confessing all of your sins and feeling guilty about everything.
</font>
<p>
But the best example of Bill Wilson's crazy mania for guilt
induction has to be this jewel where Mr. Wilson declared that we were
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">guilty of all of the <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i>,
including <b>Sloth</b></a>, because we work hard:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And how often we work hard with no better motive than to
be secure and slothful later on &#8212; only we call it &quot;retiring.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
page 67.</font>

<p>
So, working hard now, so that we can retire later, in our old age, with
some financial security, is contemptible

could result in &quot;tragic&quot; results &#8212; so we should take our received

foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders</font>
in this fashion.

But there are also plenty of other emotions, besides fear, to exploit:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
<b>Arouse Resentments.</b><br>
Adolf Hitler found a great way to get the German people on his side:
<i>Claim that Germany had been attacked by the Jews, and that the Jews
had caused World War One, and that the Jews were exploiting the German
economy after the war, which was supposedly why all of the German people
were poor and unemployed</i>, which aroused feelings of
paranoia, resentment, and anger. And then it didn't matter whether it
was the British and French, or the Jews or Communists, or Czechoslovakia
or Poland, they had all supposedly attacked Germany or German people
in one way or another, at some time or other, so it was supposedly okay
for Hitler to strike back in revenge, which he did with a vengeance.
That made Hitler look like a great leader, someone who was very strong on
national defense while he invaded foreign countries.
<p>
Fat old Nazi Reichmarshall Hermann Goering said,
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding
of the leaders. That is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they
are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism
and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.&quot;<br>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous often arouses feelings of self-pity and resentment by
complaining about how unfairly alcoholics have been treated for so long:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   Psychiatrist Leo Hennigan, a former alcoholic and author of the book
<i>A Conspiracy of Silence: Alcoholism</i>,
says that the battles he fought in the South Pacific during World War II
were nothing compared to the personal war that he fought with alcohol for 15 years.
Hennigan blames this long siege on the medical community's disinterest.
It wasn't until 1956 that the American Medical Association labeled the
condition a disease rather than immoral behavior, and even now, after
four years of training at most medical schools, doctors receive only two
hours of instruction about alcoholism. He also blames societal attitudes
that reflect people's misunderstanding about the disease. Most don't
realize that the nature of alcoholism causes the alcoholic to drink
because he must, not because he wants to. Society is also largely unaware
of alcoholism's genetic predisposition. In Hennigan's family, for example,
three maternal uncles died before 50 of the affliction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
   When Hennigan takes issue with Alcoholics Anonymous, it has nothing to
do with its tremendous 75% rate of rehabilitation. Instead, he argues
that AA relies too much on the &quot;anonymous&quot; part of its title. When the
organization began in the 1930s, the group was small and needed the shield
of anonymity, but not so today. &quot;If AA's anonymity is scrapped, the group's
ranks will swell by many millions and greatly assuage the effects of
alcoholism in America.&quot; The most therapeutic role that AA can deliver
is to allow struggling members to be encouraged by others who have &quot;been
there, done that.&quot; In fact, it was the testimony of a recovered alcoholic
that influenced the AA founders to begin the organization.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    When alcoholics are no longer anonymous, Hennigan contends, the
organization will finally fulfill the 12th step of the program which says:
&quot;Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried
to carry this message to alcoholics.&quot;<br>

<li>
Oh those poor, hard-done-by long-suffering alcoholics.
The doctors are stupid and don't know anything and don't care,
and nobody understands alcoholism, and society's attitudes are all wrong.
The only answer is to cry in your beer and go join a cult religion.

<p><li>
And that declared 75% success rate of Alcoholics Anonymous is a lie, so the author was
<a href="#assume">assuming facts not in evidence</a>.
Bill Wilson was actually
<a href="#qualifiers">lying with qualifiers</a> when made that claim &#8212; he
only counted those people <font color="#9F0000">&quot;who came to A.A. and really tried&quot;.</font>
(If they didn't quit drinking, then, in Bill Wilson's opinion, they didn't &quot;really try&quot;.)
Wilson wrote that lie in
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="_blank">the forward to the second
edition of the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
and the A.A. true believers have been repeating it ever since, but it's still a lie.
The truth is that even the two founders of Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses" target="_blank">Bill Wilson and
Dr. Robert Smith, calculated that their success rate was
a mere five percent</a> &#8212; which is just the same as the success rate
of people who do it alone, without Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p><li>
In this sentence, the author used the tricks of 
<a href="#petitio_principii">Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a>
and
<a href="#assume">Assume The Major Premise</a>:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Most don't realize that the nature of alcoholism causes the
alcoholic to drink because he must, not because he wants to.&quot;<br>
</font>
No matter how many people &quot;realize it&quot; or don't realize it,
the assumed &quot;fact&quot; is flat-out wrong, period.
Alcoholics drink because they want to.
Alcoholics have a choice.
If alcoholics didn't have any control over their drinking,
then they couldn't quit drinking.
But they do quit, by the millions, and they do it without any cult &quot;support group&quot;.

<b>Arouse 'Patriotism'.</b><br>
In the nineteen-sixties through the 'eighties, there was a

People</a>&quot;</i>, which featured
squeaky-clean, well-shorn beautiful young people singing and
dancing and waving the American flag in patriotic skits.
Although the show never explicitly said that we should go over to the
other side of the world and drop bombs on skinny, starving rice
farmers in Viet Nam and kill about two million innocent civilians,
that was the effective message, and that's what happened.
All of that, just from appealing to &quot;love of country&quot;,

<b>Arouse 'Love' and exploit peoples' loneliness.</b><br>

The Moonies (members of Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church)

Basically I felt a great love and warmth from all sides and I
couldn't understand why they were so loving and warm. Why were they
so serving? At times I found it a bit oppressive, it was too much
for me at some times. I couldn't understand why they were doing
it because I'd never met Christians like that before. They were
talking about changing the world. Other Christians always talk
about the Bible and believing in Jesus Christ and believing faith
would do it &#8212; and I believed that that wasn't going to do it

<li>
<b>Appeal to Sentimentality and Nostalgia.</b><br>
Many successful politicians have a collection of mawkish sentimental stories to
tell, real tear-jerkers, to appeal to the voters' emotions.  They brag about their
retarded kid that they didn't let go of, or their sick kid, or the child that died,
or their wife with cancer, or good old Mom, or their grandparents who were such wonderful
&quot;God-fearing&quot; people before they died, or the father who mined coal until
he died putting his children through college.
<p>
There are also the glowing stories of the &quot;good old days&quot;, and how
wonderful life was in a small town way back when. Andy Griffith built a whole
sentimental world, <i>Mayberry</i>, on such fond remembrances,
a small town where life was simple and everybody knew
everybody else and the biggest crimes were parking tickets, and the bumbling
Deputy Sherrif Barney Fife (Don Knotts) was not allowed to carry a loaded gun.
Politicians love to invoke such images as &quot;the Real America&quot;, and
&quot;the forgotten America&quot;.
<p>
Of course those nostalgic stories don't
really have anything to do with what this politician might do if he gets his hands
on some power and taxpayers' money, or whether he will devote his careeer to
collecting bribes, but his stories sure sound sentimental.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous also uses sentimentality and stories of the &quot;good old days&quot;
to talk about how wonderful A.A. was way back when...  In fact, there is a whole
<a href="orange-letters119.html#Steve_B" target="_blank">
&quot;Back To The Basics&quot; fundamentalist school of A.A.</a>
 that insists that A.A. worked great in
the early days, and that A.A. is having difficulties now only because &quot;the message&quot;
has become &quot;watered down&quot;.
But if we just get back to the basics and practice that old-timey religion properly, then
it will work correctly and everything will be wonderful.
<p>
Alas, it isn't so.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
A.A. was a failure in the beginning too, and Bill Wilson just lied about it

<p><br>
<a name="afraid"> </a>
<li> <b>Are You Afraid?</b><br>
This is a mind game that tricks people into doing whatever you wish by implying
that they are afraid to do it, and that's the only reason why they won't do it.
This trick arouses several emotions: macho pride, fear of cowardice, fear of being shamed
or embarrassed, and it urges people to do something just to prove that they aren't afraid.
<p>
<a name="Hassan_invited"> </a>
Steve Hassan, in his book, <i>&quot;Releasing the Bonds:
Empowering People to Think for Themselves&quot;</i>,
described  how, as a 19-year-old student at Queens College
in New York City, he was approached by three attractive women
who said they were also students, and invited him to dinner.
He had just broken up with his girlfriend, so he was lonely, and
didn't mind having some female companionship. He wound up accompanying
his new friends to a few weekend workshops &#8212; all in the spirit
of being &quot;open minded.&quot;
<p>
&quot;It dawned on me when I was driving with them to an estate
in upstate New York owned by the Unification Church. I'd ask them,
<font color="blue">
'Why are we going there?'</font>
They would turn it around on me and say,
<font color="#4f007f">
'Why, are you afraid?'</font>&quot; Hassan recounted.
And <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#heavenly_deception" target="_blank">that deception was the beginning
of several years</a> of &quot;service&quot; to the cult.

Apophenia is also known as &quot;seeing through tinted lenses&quot;.

<p>
People's brains have an unfortunate tendency to see what they expect to see, and only
notice what they want to see.
Once somebody buys into a peculiar model of reality, a perceptual filter kicks in
where they notice more and more &quot;facts&quot; that appear to reinforce their chosen beliefs,
and they ignore any conflicting information that comes along, so they become
more and more convinced of the correctness of their beliefs:

A skillful propagandist can use this human logical failing to his advantage.
Apophenia helps to create really blinded, convinced, true believers.
Radical politicians, extremist preachers, and cult leaders all encourage
and exploit <i>apophenia</i> in their followers.
Start off by teaching the followers and believers merely biased and questionable
&quot;facts&quot;, and then use those non-facts as the basis for believing
more unrealistic ideas, which form the basis
for more radical views, which lead to unquestioning belief in even more radical ideas.
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
Many years ago, I went to a Pentecostal church service where the preacher read a newspaper
article about the Satanic funeral of a Satan-worshipper. The Satanic preacher consigned the
dead man's soul to Hell and the care of Satan. Rather than dismissing this story as an example
of the stupidity and foolishness of some people, the preacher declared that this was proof
that they were locked in mortal combat with Satan and that they must become even more devoted,
unshakeable, true believer Pentecostals.

<p><li>
I was recently watching an episode of the TV program <i>Uncovered: Alien Files</i>, where,
in just a few minutes, I got statements that assumed the truth of the Bermuda Triangle, Flight 19,
Atlantis, alien spacecraft, the Roswell flying saucer crash, and the government coverup.
That show is apophenia to the max.
<p>
<blockquote>
(Flight 19 was an incident where a squadron of fighter aircraft took off from a base in
Florida and flew out over the Atlantic ocean and became disoriented and ran out of fuel and crashed
into the sea and were lost. Then a flying boat that went to rescue them also crashed into the ocean
and was lost. No traces of the lost aircraft or the flight crews were ever found.
The UFO true believers insist that aliens kidnapped them. You can get more details from the Wikipedia

<p><li> Extremist right-wing politicians declare that the sad state of affairs in America is caused
by &quot;Liberals&quot; and welfare queens sucking the money out of America. They never mention oil companies
getting billions of dollars in tax breaks and ultra-cheap leases of government-owned offshore oil
fields. And those policians argue that workers demanding decent wages is driving American companies
overseas where cheap Chinese labor will work for less. (There is some truth to that, but making American
workers live in poverty is not the answer. If all of the workers are broke, who will buy the
products in the stores and make the economy go?) And of course &quot;Big Government&quot;
is just messing everything up.
(But don't expect those angry right-wingers to give up their lucrative farm subsidies or
their fat defense contracts from Washington.)

<p><li> Extremist left-wing politicians see every billionaire in America
(except George Soros and Warren Buffet) as monstrously selfish and evil criminals
who are practically the spawn of Satan &#8212; heartless creeps who deliberately
steal food out of the mouths of babies, and take away their medical care,
and destroy America by outsourcing American jobs and giving them to cheap Chinese wage-slaves.
(There is a shred of truth in this, but only a tiny shred. Sufferers from apophenia
way over-blow it.  There are actually good rich people who really want to do the right thing.)

When people objected to major credit card companies paternalistically declaring that you could not pay for
certain purchases with their credit cards, like medical marijuana, gambling chips, online pornography, or donations to Wikileaks,
a defender of the credit card companies declared:

Paul, you sound like one of those who believe you have the right to do

A blogger described the behavior of Pentecostal recruiters who use
the <i>ad hominem</i> technique on people who disagree with them:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...when a Pentecostal cannot get you to agree with his
memorized slogans or his procedure to manipulate you into doing and
thinking in his way, he will dispense with you as a corrupt, or even
as an evil person. Furthermore, if his mind is working even at a
deficient level of efficiency, and part of his mind can see that you
have a valid point, he will immediately recognize your &quot;logic&quot; as a
threat and he is likely to attack you personally, and accuse you of
ulterior motives for holding such &quot;logic.&quot; However, he cannot see
that his response is not a rational response to a respectable
argument, but a change in the context &#8212; he changes the subject from
the topic at hand to you personally, and proceeds with this attack.
<p>
This, I assert, is the basis of FRAUD.
<p>
It is based upon a faulty system whereby the person is not bound by
the ground rules of a logical system. They are not engaging in a debate
or discussion with you; they are trying to manipulate you. They might
try to deceive you into thinking that they are open to discussion or a
respectable debate, but they are not; they are being deceitful, crafty,
irrational, and devious. Again, go back and read what I described above.
If they talk to you and then proceed to attack you personally instead
of focusing upon the subject at hand, they are playing a manipulation
game and not entering into a serious discussion. When they accuse you
of bitterness without listening to your arguments, they are hustling you;
the same goes for any other number of epithets they use to dismiss you
and attack you personally, like backslider, reprobate, rebellious, etc.<br>

When Jesse Prince, a former leader of Scientology in Denmark,
criticized the dishonest financial practices that he
had seen in Scientology, a spokesman for Scientology answered,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To make allegations about the church's finances now, Mr. Prince, who has
not been a position of responsibility in the church for nearly 15 years,
and who hasn't even worked for the church for more than 7 years, is, uh,
very specious. He's not in any position to know.<br>

<p>
Note that Mason did not actually deny or even answer Prince's statements about
Scientology's history of financial dishonesty &#8212; Mason just implied that Prince
didn't know what he was talking about because Prince couldn't know what the
<i>current</i> facts were. That's a type of <i>Ad Hominem</i> attack.<br>
<font color="blue">
(It's also bad logic:
<font color="#4f007f">

Sometimes <i>ad hominem</i> attacks can be quite subtle. When the Alaska oil pipeline
was pierced by a bullet, 275,000 gallons of oil spilled out
because the operators of the pipeline took several days to stop the leak. As you can imagine,
some Alaskan citizens complained.
Aleyesca, the pipeline operator, claimed that it had handled the accident
in a competent manner, and that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The criticism came from a small group of critics who always criticize everything that we
do.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt22">22</a></sup></font><br>
That is a kind of <i>ad hominem</i> attack on critics.<br>
The oil company did not actually respond to the charges and accusations of incompetence.
They did not explain why it took them several days to plug a single bullet hole.
They merely attacked their critics, trying to assert that the criticism was invalid
because it came from a small group of vocal critics.<br>
But the truth is: It does not matter whether the criticism comes from a small group of
diligent watch-dog citizens or a large environmental protection agency &#8212;
valid criticism is valid criticism, and incompetence is incompetence.

<p>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
King ez can't spell worth a damn, and places punctuation at random
between words so his writing will look like &#8212; books he sees; at

<!---- <font color="#9F0000">[Dead Link]</font> -->

</blockquote>
<p>
That attack uses both <i>ad hominem</i> and sarcasm.
But there was not a word of defense of A.A., or any facts relating to the subject
of &quot;addiction to A.A.&quot;. Just complaints about imaginary errors.
And the funny thing is, I couldn't find any incorrect punctuation,
and only a few misspellings, in the original post.
But who needs facts when you are defending a cult?

<p>
And a cute variation on that theme is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh you poor thing. I'm so sorry to hear that the 12-Steppers
hurt you so bad.
You are obviously in need of some counselling. Just call 1-234-567-8901

In other words,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">

<a name="name_calling"> </a>

This technique is simple and obvious: you just call your opponents names, preferably

<li> If someone wants to leave a few old trees standing in the forest,
call him a &quot;tree-hugger&quot;.

get off, call him &quot;a bleeding-heart Liberal.&quot;

Notice that name-calling allows you to actually define your opponent, based on
just a few facts, or even on no facts whatsoever.

When a photography web site
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161130003614/http://www.dpreview.com/" target="_blank">DPreview.com</a>)
gave a well-deserved low rating to an Olympus
E-510 digital SLR camera, one Olympus fan retaliated with,

<p> When I complained about how inferior the Olympus E-510 was in so many ways,
another Olympus fan-boy responded with the same &quot;Delegitimize One's Opponent&quot; propaganda trick,
implying that I was stupid for expecting it to be a good camera:

A.A. members use this

On May 18, 2007, former President Jimmy Carter criticized the Bush administration</a>,
saying that President George W. Bush's administration is &quot;the worst in history&quot;
when it comes to international relations.
<p>
Carter, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, criticized Bush:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;We now have endorsed the concept of pre-emptive war where we go to war
with another nation militarily, even though our own security is not
directly threatened, if we want to change the regime there or if we fear
that some time in the future our security might be endangered. But that's
been a radical departure from all previous administration policies.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Carter's harshest assessment was of the White House's Office of
Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, which helped religious charities
receive $2.15 billion in federal grants in fiscal year 2005 alone:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The policy from the White House has been to allocate funds to religious
institutions, even those that channel those funds exclusively to their
own particular group of believers in a particular religion. Those things
in my opinion are quite disturbing. As a traditional
Baptist, I've always believed in separation of church and state and
honored that premise when I was president, and so have all other
presidents, I might say, except this one.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson questioned
why Carter, who teaches Sunday School in his hometown of Plains, Georgia,
would attack Bush:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Apparently, Sunday mornings in Plains for former President Carter
includes hurling reckless accusations at your fellow man.
It's hard to take a lecture on foreign policy seriously from
President Carter considering he's the same person who challenged
Ronald Reagan's strategy for the Cold War.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice that she did not actually answer any of President Carter's criticisms of
Bush's policies and actions.
She just attacked the source of the criticism, and tried to imply that Carter had
no legitimate grounds for criticizing Bush, and therefore the criticism was invalid.
<p>
And of course Ms. Wilkerson also used
<a href="#ad_hominem">the <i>ad hominem</i> technique</a>,
personally attacking President Carter, as well as completely
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial" target="_blank">reversing reality</a>.
She accused Carter of
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;hurling reckless accusations at your fellow man&quot;</font>
when she was actually the one who was doing that.
Carter did not &quot;hurl reckless accusations&quot;;
Carter spoke about the American tradition of never attacking first and
never deliberately starting wars and never being the aggressor,
and the American tradition of separation of church and state.
And Carter spoke about how the current Bush administration had violated those policies.
But she didn't want to talk about that, so she attacked President Carter personally,
and said that it's hard to take him seriously.

<a name="delegitimize"> </a>
<li> <b>Delegitimize Criticism and Rebuttal in Advance</b><br>
Devalue, delegitimize, and reject responses in advance of them happening.

For instance:

<ol>
<li> &quot;Oh, don't mention Prof. Falken's study. Everybody knows he's nuts.&quot; (Slander.)
<li> &quot;I don't want to start an argument, but...&quot; (So don't contradict the nonsense that I'm saying.)

</ol>

<p>
Bill Wilson used this technique too:
<p>
<blockquote>

So if you don't want to go along with

of those disgusting sinful alcoholics, then you are being &quot;unreasonable&quot;.

<p>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#absurd_ideas" target="_blank">
Bill Wilson did it again here</a>, in a different way,
as he taught people how to conduct s&eacute;ances
and channel God and get messages and work orders and power from God:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this
for a while.
What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration becomes a working
part of the mind.
Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact
with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired
at all times.
<font color="#9F0000">
We might pay for this presumption in all sorts
of absurd actions and ideas.</font>
Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will,
as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson declared that if somebody started acting crazy from doing Step 11 because he was
convinced that God was telling him to do insane things, that wasn't the fault
of Bill's occult practices, or of &quot;God&quot; &#8212; that was just a beginner who had not learned
how to be a good psychic yet. So don't criticize Bill's superstitious practices;
there is nothing wrong with them. It's just the beginners' fault.

<p><br>
<a name="spurious_reject"> </a>
<li> <b>Spurious Rejection of a Question</b><br>
Use invalid or spurious reasons for rejecting a question that you don't wish to answer.
<p>
For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
&quot;That question was a trap!&quot;
<li>
&quot;That question is unfair!&quot;
<li>
&quot;That's none of your business!&quot;

</ul>



<p><br>
<a name="demonize"> </a>
<li> <b>Demonize the Enemy</b><br>
Make one's enemy into the Devil incarnate. Tell endless stories how evil and monstrous the enemy is.

<p>
For example, as the Bush administration lied us into the War in Iraq, we were told that
Saddam Hussein was &quot;the Hitler of the Middle East&quot;, and that he used chemical weapons on
his enemies (which the USA actually gave him to use on the Iranians),
and that his troops were so heartless and brutal that they threw
Kuwaiti babies out of incubators and onto the floor as they stole the incubators.
The latter story was actually a lie told by the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador
to incite Americans to go to war on behalf of Kuwait.

<p>
In A.A. circles, those people who criticize Alcoholics Anonymous are demonized with accusations
that they don't care
<a href="orange-disservice.html" target="_blank">how many alcoholics they kill</a>
(by telling the truth and discouraging people from believing in A.A.).


<p><br>
<a name="stroking"> </a>
<li> <b>Stroking Ploys</b><br>
This is just the opposite of name-calling &#8212; call somebody good things,
like: &quot;a patriot, a real American, a great Christian, a real credit
to his race, an example to us all, an inspiration.&quot;
<p>
A late-night TV infomercial that advertizes an exercise machine introduces
the machine's designer as:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Here is Joe Blow, one of the hottest men in Hollywood because he gives
people what they want &#8212; crisp, lean, healthy bodies.&quot;
</font>

<p>
A radio advertisement for vitamins says, &quot;Dr. Sawbones, a recognized authority on blah-blah...&quot;
Recognized by whom?
We got no actual evidence that Dr. Sawbones knows anything.

<p>
The true-believer Buchmanite Theophil Spoerri gave us examples of both
denigration and stroking ploys in his biased biography of Frank Buchman:
Dr. John Hibben, President of Princeton University, was called
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;a well-meaning but weak man&quot;</i>,
</font>
and Spoerri said,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;fearing for the good name of the university, [he]
allowed himself to be stampeded&quot;</i>,
</font>
when President Hibben banished Frank Buchman and his cult from Princeton.
On the other hand,
Spoerri called the lady Anneliese von Cramon-Prittwitz, who
converted to Buchmanism,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;a distinguished and intelligent woman.&quot;</i>
</font>
<font size="-1">
(<i>Dynamic Out Of Silence: Frank Buchman's Relevance Today</i>,
Theophil Spoerri, pages 77 and 114, respectively.)
</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson gave us an example of this technique in
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">his pro-smoking story</a>
on page 135 of the <i>Big Book</i>. The chain-smoking A.A. member
who threw a drunken screaming temper tantrum to avoid quitting smoking was called
<font color="#4f007f"><i><b>
&quot;our friend&quot;</b></i></font>
and
<font color="#4f007f"><i><b>
&quot;a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</b></i></font>,
while his clean and sober wife who was pleading with
him to quit killing himself with cigarettes was called
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;one of those persons&quot;</i></font>

who are always trying to keep us good old boys from having fun.


<p><br>
<a name="offloading_blame"> </a>
<li> <b>Offloading Blame</b><br>
<p>
The propagandist never accepts blame for his mistakes or crimes. Somebody or something else
is always to blame. This is especially true of politicians and cult leaders who have
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Now look at what you made me do.&quot;<br>
&quot;He started it.&quot;<br>
&quot;He did it first.&quot;<br>
&quot;It's all because of them.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The following tricks are various ways to offload blame.
<ol>

<p><br>
<a name="scapegoat"> </a>
<li> <b>Blame A Scapegoat</b><br>
This is a well-known trick: find a scapegoat to blame for all of your group's problems.
<p>
Hitler was of course infamous for blaming the Jews for all of Germany's economic
problems after World War One.
He even claimed that
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#no_culture" target="_blank">a Jewish conspiracy</a>
had caused World War One.
And Hitler insisted that the Germans would be very happy
after the Jews were eliminated.


<p><br>
<a name="blame_victim"> </a>
<li> <b>Blame The Victim</b><br>
If a crime is committed against someone, blame the victim instead
of the perpetrator.
When something goes wrong, blame the victim rather than the cause of the
problem.
<p>
Trial lawyers love to use this one:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;That bastard deserved to get murdered. He had it coming.
His killer did the world a favor.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Or,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;She deserved to get raped. She was asking for it.
Look at the sexy way she dressed.
<a href="#everybody">Everybody knew</a> that she was a loose woman.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is part of the classic &quot;Nuts and Sluts&quot; defense &#8212; claim that the woman
who got raped is crazy and a whore (so presumably, it doesn't matter that she
claims that she was raped).

<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You were just gullible and asking for it...&quot;
</font>

<p>
After somebody gets robbed, tell him,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You shouldn't tempt people. You shouldn't let poor people see such valuable things.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Another example from politics:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;John Kerry deserves to get attacked with lies and smears
committed by the <i>'Swift Boat Veterans for Truth'</i>.
He brought it on himself by daring to mention his good war record.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Sometimes this technique is used very subtley. Get a load of what a merchant says when his
company goofs and ships the wrong part to a customer:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;<b>RMA #: 106260 - Wrong Item Received</b>&quot;</font><br>
Note &#8212; wrong item received by customer, not wrong part shipped by merchant.
That stupid customer went and received the wrong part.

<p>
Bill Wilson and A.A. are masters of this stunt. Bill Wilson wrote these
lies in the <i>Big Book</i>, and they are read out loud at the start
of every A.A. meeting:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed
our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or
will not completely give themselves to this simple program,
usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of
being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates.
They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way.
They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner
of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are
less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave
emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if
they have the capacity to be honest.<br>
...<br>
At some of these [steps] we balked. We thought we could find an
easier, softer way. But we could not.<br>

<p>
If the hocus-pocus voodoo-medicine cult religion
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">program of Alcoholics Anonymous doesn't work</a>,
and doesn't really help you to quit drinking, then it's all your own fault
because you are so bad, so dishonest and lazy, and selfish and manipulative,
always seeking an easier, softer way, and you were born that way:
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The program doesn't fail people; people fail the program.&quot;
</font>
</center>

<font color="#9F0000">

</font>

<p><br>
<a name="blame"> </a>
<li> <b>Blame Somebody Else (Anybody Else)</b><br>
This is the more general version of <i>Blaming A Scapegoat</i>.
<ul>
<li>
You can blame other people for your problems &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They are all against me. They have been sabotaging me at every turn.&quot;
</font>

<li>
You can blame subordinates for your poor job performance:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;No one in the Intelligence Community urged me to step back from my
tough talk about a nuclear Iran posing a danger of World War Three.&quot;
</font>

</ul>
<p>
A popular variation on this technique is, <i>&quot;Do Whatever You Wish To Do, And Blame Somebody Else For It&quot;</i>.
<ul>
<li> &quot;The reason why I must create and enforce such draconian rules and
regulations is because some people cause problems.&quot;
<li> &quot;We wouldn't need to bug your telephone and spy on you if it wasn't for the terrorists...&quot;
<li> &quot;Now look at what you made me do.&quot;

</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="nonfactor"> </a>
<li> <b>Blame A Non-Factor</b><br>
Blame something that isn't really the cause of the problem. (It's a kind of diversion tactic,
diverting attention from what is really wrong.)
<p>
Homer Simpson, refusing a beer: &quot;Can I just have a glass of water?&quot;<br>
Moe the Bartender: &quot;Water?! That stuff killed my Grandmother.&quot;

<p>
George W. Bush recently gave us a good example of this technique.
While touring in Biloxi, Mississippi, in early May 2006, Bush declared
that he would like Congress to &quot;give me a capacity to raise CAFE standards.&quot;
(CAFE is &quot;corporate average fuel economy&quot; &#8212; the miles-per-gallon
standards for new cars.)
Well gee, it seems like Bush would have raised the fuel efficiency
standards long ago, if it weren't for that nasty Republican-controlled
Congress tying his hands and keeping him from doing the right thing.
<p>
But
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161130003614/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201484_pf.html" target="_blank">
Bush always had the power to change the fuel standards</a>.
Ronald Reagan didn't need the approval of Congress to change the standards (downward).
Certainly Congress was under the impression that the President could
require cars to get better mileage in the 1990s, since it went out of
its way, using annual spending legislation, to prevent President Clinton
from doing so.
But now that the public is noticing that Bush has done nothing to make
the car manufacturers build in better fuel efficiency, Bush claims that
he needs Congress to allow him to do his job.

<!------------
(But he doesn't need Congress to allow him to
persue the war in Iraq, and he doesn't need Congress to allow him to spy on all Americans, and
he doesn't need Congress to allow him to make people disappear to foreign prisons where
they are tortured...)
--------->

<p>
Likewise, A.A. boosters try to explain away the immense A.A. failure rate by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, you can't consider those people who drop out of A.A. without working the
Twelve Steps to be failures of Alcoholics Anonymous. They don't count. You can't blame
A.A. if they won't work the Steps.
And you can't blame A.A. for those drunks who didn't <i>&quot;work a
strong program&quot;</i>. They don't count.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Actually, they do count. No matter why people quit A.A. without quitting drinking,
A.A. still failed to get those alcoholics sober. They are still a part of the
A.A. failure rate.
Either the A.A. program works to make alcoholics quit drinking, or it doesn't.
<p>
Something that is so repulsive that it causes 95% of the newcomers drop out within a year
cannot claim that it is a great success, or would be a great success, if only people would follow orders.
<p>

And what about all of the people who spent years in A.A., working the Steps and
&quot;working a strong program&quot;, and who regularly relapsed anyway?
The speaker doesn't mention them. He tries to pretend that they don't exist &#8212;
he tries to claim that all of the A.A. failures and dropouts are solely due to
people not working the program correctly.
<p>
(And then they use a self-referential definition of &quot;correctly&quot;. Someone who
is &quot;working the program correctly&quot; is abstaining from drinking. So by definition,
the program &quot;always works if people work it correctly&quot;.)

</ol>


<p><br>
<a name="panacea"> </a>
<li> <b>Claim That There Is A Panacea</b><br>
Claim that there is, or that you have, a magical cure for all of your listeners' problems.
<p>
Adolf Hitler told the German people that he had a simple sure-fire cure for Germany's
economic woes: National Socialism, which really meant fascism, which included getting
rid of the Jews and Leftists, and having Germany run by &quot;one strong leader&quot;,
and getting revenge on Britain and France.... We all know how well that worked out.

<p>
Bill Wilson declared that the relabeled Oxford Group cult religion
(which he called &quot;the Alcoholics Anonymous program&quot;) was
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_giggly" target="_blank">the answer to <i>all</i>
of an alcoholic's problems</a>:

<p><br>
<a name="panmalefic"> </a>
<li> <b>Claim That There Is A Panmalefic</b><br>
A <i>panmalefic</i> is just the opposite of a panacea.
A panmalefic is supposedly the one big bad cause of all of your problems.
<p>
I just made that word up. A panmalefic is the exact opposite of a panacea.
Where a panacea is one simple cure for all of your problems, a panmalefic is the
one simple cause of all of your problems.
<p>
The prefix &quot;pan&quot; means &quot;over all&quot; or
&quot;entirely covers&quot; or &quot;everywhere&quot;,
as in pan-American, pandemic, and panacea.
<br>
The word &quot;malefic&quot; is in the dictionary,
and means &quot;causes evil, bad things, ills, harm, or diseases&quot;.
<br>
Put them together, and you have a word that means the cause of all of the world's problems.
<p>
Simple-minded people like simple answers, so they love to hear that everything can
be explained in terms of panmalefics and panaceas.

<p>
Historically, plenty of rabble-rousers have used the panmalefic idea to blame one scapegoat or another
for everything:

&quot;Jews are the cause of all of our problems and are a great threat to our children

<li> <b>Flattery</b><br>
Get someone to accept the bulls**t that you are shovelling by flattering and praising
them. This is an unabashed appeal to egotism.

<p>
For example, a television commercial tells housewives that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are so wonderful &#8212;
you juggle six jobs at once, take care of three kids,
and still manage to look good &#8212; so that's why you
should buy our junk. A sophisticated person like yourself would settle for
nothing less...&quot;</font>
<p>
Another commercial declares,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Your life has more than one dimension.
That's why you wouldn't consider playing [golf] with anything but...&quot;
</font>
<p>
And another commercial says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;There is no mass-produced human being. We know that you are unique, with special
tastes.&quot;</font>
(That's why you should buy the same mass-produced junk that we sell to everybody else.)
<p>
The advertising on a box of clove cigarettes says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Their brown wrapping is uniquely created to suit your distinct
personality.&quot;</font><br>
<ul>
<li>
My distinct personality? What is so distinct about being stupid enough to
get addicted to nicotine and burn out your lungs?
<li>
And that brown wrapping isn't unique. They crank out those clove cigarettes
by the millions,
and every last one of them has the same brown wrapping, no matter whether they
are being made for me or for the teenage kids down the street.
</ul>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses this stunt too. If you believe A.A. propaganda,
you will <i>&quot;Come To Believe&quot;</i> that
<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html" target="_blank">only unto you has the Lord given the gift</a>

God in His wisdom has selected a group of men to be the purveyors of His

He went not to the proud, the mighty, the famous or the brilliant. He

drunkard, the so-called weakling of the world. Well might He have said to us: 
<blockquote>
<i>Into your weak and feeble hands I have entrusted a Power beyond estimate.

Well, God might have said that to them, but God didn't really
say that to them, now did He?
Nowhere in the Bible, The Talmud, the Koran, the Bhagavad-Gita, the Sutras, the Vedas,
the Upanishads, the Dead Sea Scrolls, or any other major religion's scriptures
does it say that the alcoholics are God's Chosen People,

<a name="anecdote"> </a>
<li> <b>Proof by Anecdote</b><br>

<i>Proof by Anecdote</i> is a stunt where you make some
grand generalization, and then you tell one or more
stories that appear to support your generalization,
and then you conclude that the point is proven.
(You can ignore all of the other stories that disprove your point.)

<p>
For example, President Ronald Reagan gave a speech on TV where he
told of Sandinista soldiers tying a priest to a tree and beating him.
Reagan concluded that this story was proof enough of the evils of the
Sandinistas to justify the USA waging an undeclared, illegal, war
against Nicaragua for several years, the war that ended with the
treasonous Iran-Contra <i>Arms-for-Hostages</i> and the
Oliver-North-Contra <i>Cocaine-for-Guns</i> fiascoes.
<br>
<font color="blue">
(President Reagan didn't bother to give any TV speeches complaining
about how many Nicaraguan civilians were killed by the Contras, or how many American
inner-city black kids were killed by the Contras' cocaine.
Just a few anecdotal stories of Sandinista soldiers' misbehavior was all of
the evidence that Reagan needed or wanted...)
</font>
<p>
This <i>Proof-by-Anecdote</i> technique is heavily used in advertising:
<ul>
<li> &quot;Diets never worked for Susan, but then she discovered the Shrivel-Up Program&reg; and lost 50 pounds.&quot;
<li> &quot;My wife and I needed a new dishwasher. Thanks to you we received a $1900 Viking dishwasher for free!&quot;
<li> &quot;I made $8000 in my first week of trading.&quot;
<li> &quot;He made more money on that trade than he made in a week on his job. And what computer program did
he use to trade stocks? The XYZ program from the stock market genius Joe Blow.&quot;
<li> A radio commercial that advertises a service that will deal with the IRS for you says,
&quot;I owed the IRS $125,000, and they settled for $22,000.&quot;
But of course there is no evidence that you will get that lucky.
</ul>
<p>
The plural of &quot;anecdote&quot; is not &quot;evidence&quot;.

<p>
Lots of organizations like to use poster children to &quot;prove&quot;
their point. The homophobic fundamentalist Christians show off one
guy who says that he got &quot;converted&quot; from homosexuality or
bi-sexuality to straight heterosexuality, and then they claim that
their poster-child example proves that all gays are merely
&quot;choosing a gay lifestyle&quot;, and that they can change if
they want to.

<p>
Likewise, the entire back two thirds of the Alcoholics Anonymous <i>Big Book</i>, with all of its
autobiographical stories, is just one long demonstration of the
<i>Proof by Anecdote</i> propaganda technique.
Bill Wilson just printed a collection of people's stories, all of which
claimed that A.A. had helped them in some great way, and then
Bill concluded that the stories proved all kinds of things like:
<ul>
<li> that the A.A. program and the Twelve Steps really work for quitting drinking,
<li> that the A.A. program is the <i>only</i> thing that works.
<li> that prayer really works, and that God could, and would, if they
asked Him to, answer their prayers, and remove all of their &quot;defects
of character&quot;, and make them quit drinking.
<li> that people must <i>completely</i> surrender and <i>completely</i>
give themselves to the &quot;simple&quot; A.A. program,
<li> that if you pray and meditate enough, you can hear God or some
other Higher Power talking to you in your head,
<li> that you can get wonderful results, and recover from alcoholism,
by praying to just any old God or &quot;Higher Power&quot;, and your
&quot;Higher Power&quot; can be anything you wish it to be, including
the A.A. group itself.
<li> that God is actually eager to start doing favors for you and
granting all of your wishes, just as soon as you start doing Bill Wilson's
Twelve Steps.
</ul>

<p>
&#8212; None of which were actually proven, or even demonstrated by a fair
sampling of cases. It is obvious that the stories are just another
example of cherry-picking &#8212; Bill printed only those stories that said
what he wanted people to believe, and rejected everything else.
A.A. members who didn't get sober did not get to put their stories in the <i>Big Book</i>.
(And &quot;cherry-picking&quot; is actually just another name for
<a href="#observational"><i>Observational Selection</i></a>.)
<p>
This is another example of <i>Proof by Anecdote</i>, used in a
slightly different way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Step Nine has reclaimed many broken friendships; it has brought peace
and happiness to the lives of those who suffered because of our
alcoholism. Its great rehabilitative power has also affected the lives
of thousands of alcoholics through the spiritual awakening they
have experienced. Because of this Step, these alcoholics have
recovered their self-respect, they have taken on courage and
confidence, and they have assumed responsibility. They sense God's
presence, and with His presence comes the realization that their
lives are again becoming manageable.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 89.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Gee, that sounds pretty fantastic. I guess we should all start doing the
Twelve Steps immediately, so that we can get the <i>Big Experience</i> too, right?
<p>
Well, it sounds great, but only until we remember that A.A.
claims to be keeping millions of alcoholics sober. If only
&quot;thousands&quot; out of millions get the wonderful
&quot;spiritual awakening&quot; and &quot;sense God's presence&quot;,
then the odds of getting <i>&quot;The Big Spiritual Experience&quot;</i>
are really only one in a thousand.
<p>
Now that doesn't sound so awe-inspiring, does it?<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Note just how carefully that deceptive, double-talking Hazelden
propaganda was constructed. If we read it critically, we will see that
<i>maybe</i> a few thousand people &#8212; out of millions of claimed A.A. members &#8212;
have benefited in some way from the Twelve Steps that Bill Wilson wrote.
But, without hesitation or qualifications, Hazelden says that the
guilt-inducing Twelve Steps will give people:
<ul>
<li> self-respect
<li> courage
<li> confidence
<li> responsibility
<li> awareness of the presence of God
<li> and manageable lives
</ul>
without offering us any actual evidence or proof of their unfounded grandiose
claims that the 12-Step program has &quot;great rehabilitative power.&quot;

The pigs in George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> wrote:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<li>
An Oxford Group leader bragged about the accomplishments of the Groups as,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Men are becoming freed from acquisitive greed into stewardship of property;
they are becoming freed from the stagnation of the instinct of curiosity
into a new enlightened stewardship of the mind.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Oxford and the Groups</i>, Rev. G. F. Allen, <i>et al.</i>, page 40.<br></font>

<font color="blue">
<ul>
<li> So, apparently, the greedy men get to keep their property, but not their curiosity.<br>
<li> Since when does curiosity cause stagnation of the mind? It is usually the lack
of curiosity that signals a stagnant, dull mind. Curiosity is a common characteristic
of most intelligent species, from the cat to the human. &#8212; But it is
not an &quot;instinct&quot; like sex; it is just a characteristic.<br>
<li> And what is
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;a new enlightened stewardship of the mind&quot;</i></font>?
In the Oxford Groups, it really meant
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#rational_mind" target="_blank">discarding the rational, thinking,
mind</a>, and just &quot;having faith&quot; and obeying the orders of the leaders.
(<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9" target="_blank">It's called fascism</a>.)
&#8212; So that phrase, <font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;a new enlightened
stewardship of the mind&quot;</i></font> was also really
<a href="#loaded">a euphemism</a> for
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;abject, obedient, unthinking slavery&quot;</font>. That's another propaganda trick.

</font>

<p>

More double-talk: In a TV commercial, a merchant promises:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;We guarantee that we will either have it in stock, or order more.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
But that is no big promise or guarantee.
That's what all merchants do: Sell what they have in stock,
and then order more.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
Speaking of merchants, the immortal all-time classic car salesman's double-talk is:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We lose money on every car that we sell, but we make up for it in volume.<br>

A radio commercial for a large commemorative silver coin says:
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;It's historical worth far exceeds its massive size in pure silver worth.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
Translation: It's over-priced. The cost of the coin far exceeds the value of the silver.

<p>
<li>
The Alcoholics Anonymous so-called &quot;First Tradition&quot; declares that the
A.A. group is more important than the lives of the individual people:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Each member of Alcoholics Anonymous is but a small part of a great whole.
A.A. must continue to live or most of us will surely die. Hence our
common welfare comes first. But individual welfare follows close afterward.
</font>
</blockquote>
That double-talk is just like George Orwell's great line,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Also notice the standard cult statement that
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_cant_without" target="_blank">you cannot live without the cult</a>.
<p>
<li>
A.A. promoters tell us things like:<br>

to come to Africa could have been anything from popularly-elected
Presidents to murdering territorial warlords to the chiefs of
hungry tribes of cannibals.
Just try to prove that 17 of them <i>didn't</i> invite the stout, well-fed
Frank Buchman to dinner...
<p>

You know, Peter Howard's book reads a lot like Hollywood gossip sheets
or supermarket tabloids,
which are always loaded with unverifiable sources like:<br>
<i>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Close friends say...&quot;,<br>
<li> &quot;Inside sources say...&quot;,<br>
<li> &quot;Knowledgeable persons said...&quot;,<br>
<li> &quot;An unnamed official said...&quot;,<br>
<li> &quot;It is rumored that...&quot;.<br>
<li> &quot;Some people believe that...&quot;.<br>
<li> &quot;Confidential informants say...&quot;.<br>
</ul>

<p>
And not to be left out, Bill Wilson used the same stunt in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions. One of these
men, staff member of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this statement
to some of us: &quot;What you say about the general hopelessness of the average
alcoholic's plight is, in my opinion, correct.&quot;<br>

<p>

How many doctors really agreed with Bill Wilson? It wasn't any
sizeable percentage of the American Medical Association &#8212;
what they said about the <i>Big Book</i> and Bill Wilson's
religious cure for alcoholism was:
<i>&quot;<a href="#AMA_review">the book has no scientific merit or

<li> <b>The Language Trap</b><br>
Use a word in different ways, but logically treat
it as the same concept:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;You say you're looking for truth.
Well, we refer to our
religion as 'The Truth'. Why do you think we do that?&quot;</i></font><br>
<p>
The Language Trap is not
just a rhetorical device, but a major problem in communication. It is a
&quot;trap&quot; because people on both sides of an argument can inadvertently stumble into it
if they are not
aware that the same word can be used with different senses and
connotations.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt07">7</a></sup></font>
<p>
<center><table width="87%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
When a believer and a rational person talk about the truth, they are
using the same word but they are talking about very different things.
When a rational person says, &quot;Two plus two equals four. That is the
truth.&quot;, he means that we can clearly demonstrate the truth of that
statement by adding things together. We can group objects together
and see with our own eyes the truth of two plus two adding up to four.
When a believer says that his beliefs are the truth &#8212; for example,
insisting that everything in the Bible is The Truth, and the
unquestionable Word Of God &#8212; he means something else. He means
that he won't tolerate anyone refuting the validity of his statements
or questioning the truth of those stories. He fervently believes
that if he fervently believes that some things are true, that they
will become true. (And if you don't believe, then you break the spell
and ruin the magic.) Alas, all of those beliefs are false. Simply
believing that something is true will not make it true. Two plus two
will not add up to three or five if you believe it strongly enough.

One of the more humorous examples of the Language Trap was a classic episode of the TV show
called <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. A race of space-traveling aliens came to Earth, and quickly solved all
of Earth's problems. There was no more war, or disease, or famine. It was like &quot;the Millenium&quot;.
<p>
Some people were very suspicious
of the aliens and asked what their ulterior motive was. The aliens answered that their only desire
was &quot;to serve man&quot;. Aliens even took lie detector tests, which showed that they were telling the
truth. People began leaving Earth and traveling to the aliens' homeworld in great numbers,
to enjoy the marvels of a very advanced civilization.
<p>
Meanwhile, a crew of hard-working translators were striving to translate the alien's &quot;holy book&quot;, which
was simply titled &quot;To Serve Man&quot;.  At the end of the program, the Earthlings discovered that the book
was a cookbook. The aliens wanted to &quot;serve man&quot; alright: baked, broiled, or fried.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Churches and religions stumble into this trap all of the time. They all talk about
having &quot;The Truth&quot;, and the indisputable &quot;Word of God&quot;, but their truths differ from church to church.
Nevertheless, the true believers insist that they have The Truth and everybody else is wrong.

<p>
A television evangelist constantly declares that you must &quot;plant a seed&quot; by giving him money.
He refers to the sentence in the Bible that says, &quot;As you sow, so shall you also reap.&quot;
The line in the Bible says simply that what you put out is what you get back. If you sow seeds of anger
and hatred, that is what you will get back. If you treat other people in an unfriendly manner, that
is how they will treat you.
But the TV evangelist twisted the meaning of the words and declared that you were &quot;planting a seed with the
Lord&quot; by giving him money, and he goes on and on about &quot;What are you going to harvest? If you have planted
nothing, then you will harvest nothing.&quot; That is really twisting the meaning of that line by
changing the meanings of the words &quot;sow&quot; and &quot;reap&quot;.
<p>
Also, the TV evangelist merely assumes that the viewers will get something back if
they &quot;plant a seed&quot; by giving him money. Then he assumes that any good
things that happen later in the donors' lives were caused by the &quot;seeds&quot; that they planted.
(<a href="#correlation" target="_blank">Assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists</a>.)
Then the preacher can
<a href="#testimonials" target="_blank">use testimonials</a>,
reading letters that say things like,
&quot;Mrs. Mary B. had cancer, but she planted a seed with the Lord (by giving me lots of money), so the
Lord removed her cancer, and now she is healthy and happy and cancer-free. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!&quot;

<p>
In Alcoholics Anonymous, the word &quot;alcoholic&quot; has four distinctly
different definitions that are used interchangeably, all too loosely.
(Bill Wilson started doing that in the &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;,
and his followers have been doing it ever since.)
<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol &#8212;
something like allergic to it &#8212; perhaps because he inherited a gene &#8212;
and he is someone who will become readdicted to alcohol and go on a binge and
drink for years if he drinks even just one beer.
<li> An alcoholic is somebody who cannot quit drinking &#8212; he is &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">an immoral person who is
resentful, angry, manipulative,
self-seeking, dishonest, selfish, and a prime example of instincts
run wild, self-will run riot, and the Seven Deadly Sins</a>...
and on and on and on....
</ol>

<p>
Those are four very different definitions of &quot;an alcoholic&quot;,
and they are not the same thing at all. And they are not equally applicable
to all people who have a drinking problem.
<p>
Personally,
<ol>
<li> By the first definition, I stopped being an alcoholic
<!----- UPDATE YEARS --------> thirteen years ago when I quit drinking alcohol.
<li> By the second definition,
I will always be an alcoholic &#8212; I am and always will be hypersensitive
to alcohol, and easily readdicted if I drink any more alcohol.
<li> By the third definition, I wasn't an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking, and I did.
I even quit drinking without any help from A.A., because I quit drinking two weeks before I
was ever
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">sent to an A.A. meeting</a>.

<li> By the fourth definition, I was never an alcoholic.
I was, in fact, a nice, happy, drunk, and people liked having me at their
parties because I was fun to have around when I got high.
(But, as one friend pointed out, even nice drunks die of cirrhosis of
the liver.)
</ol>

<a name="vague"> </a>
<li> <b>Vague, Undefined, Grandiose Language</b><br>

Make up all kinds of impressive-sounding grandiose phrases and
expressions that are vague and not very precisely defined, so that
no one can quite accuse you of being wrong. They can't even really
argue with you because everything is so nebulous and intangible.
It's like trying to bite fog.

impeachment, and half of the administration goes to prison.)

eliminate civil rights, rape the environment, and
give the rich people a big tax cut, all while running up staggering deficits.)
<li> States' Rights (<i>&quot;The state has rights only if I think the state
is right.&quot;</i>) States can do whatever they want to do, if and only if
the White House, the Supreme Court, and Congress happen to like it.
Think: racism and segregation, Medical Marijuana, &quot;Right to
Choose&quot; vs. &quot;Right to Life&quot;,
the year 2000 Florida Presidential elections, Physician Assisted Suicide, and
Gay Marriage.)
<li> Selfless Patriotism (serving your political party)
<li> Public Service (30 years of taking bribes)
<li> Judicial Restraint (the Republicans on the Supreme Court rig the
Y2K election.)
<li> &quot;...marching to the field of glory&quot;  &#8212;  what politicians say
to young men to drum up support for another war.

Adolf Hitler and the Nazis routinely invented euphemistic
phrases to disguise what they were doing, like the
&quot;Special Handling&quot; that they gave
the Jews, sending them to the &quot;Final Solution.&quot;
&quot;Guest workers&quot; were really foreigners who had
been kidnapped at gunpoint and forced into slave labor brigades.
Zyklon B, the poison gas used to kill millions of Jews, was called
&quot;material for the resettlement of Jews&quot;.
<p>
Sometimes, the euphemisms became comical. By the end of World War Two,
the Germans had 30 euphemisms for <b>&quot;retreat&quot;</b>,
including &quot;planned withdrawal,
successful disengagement, elastic defense, mobile defense, retrocessive maneuver,
withdrawing maneuver, unencircling maneuver, according to plan, shortening of
the front, systematic evacuation, without enemy pressure, undisturbed by the
enemy, and withdrawal to the enemy's surprise.&quot;
<p>

Likewise, Mao Tse Tung sent his enemies to slave labor on remote
farms for &quot;re-education&quot; so that they would learn to
&quot;blossom properly.&quot; And all of the Commumists were notorious for
&quot;liberating&quot; people, like the Tibetans, Latvians, Lithuanians,
and Estonians, who did not wish to be
&quot;liberated&quot; by the Chinese People's Army or the Soviet Army.
And now, of course, George W. Bush is &quot;liberating&quot; Iraq in
the same manner.

<p>
<li>
Throughout the entire second half of the twentieth century, various
United States Presidents used the term &quot;police action&quot;,
rather than &quot;war&quot;, to get around limitations on Presidential
powers, and to avoid having to tell the public that we actually were
in yet another war.

In the Oxford Groups and Moral Re-Armament cults, Frank Buchman's
&quot;inspired democracy&quot; really meant slavery:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
An increasing number of citizens in democratic states are now unwilling
to acknowledge in speech and action those inner authorities on which
the life of democracy depends. Each man has his own plan.
It's so wonderful each to have his own plan. It's such freedom, such liberty!
Everyone does as he pleases. But not in the Oxford Group. There you have
true democracy. You don't do as you please, you do as God guides.
You do God's plan.<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous makes extensive use of
loaded language and redefined words:
<p>
<ul>
<li> In Alcoholics Anonymous
terminology, the word &quot;sobriety&quot; doesn't
mean &quot;not drinking&quot; or &quot;an unintoxicated
state&quot;; it has this bombastic redefinition:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A special
state of Grace gained by working the Steps and maintaining absolute
abstinence. It is characterized by
feelings of Serenity and Gratitude. It is a state of living
according to God's will, not one's own. It
is sanity.&quot;
</font>
<p>

<li> Likewise,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Sanity is living according to God's Will,
rather than one's own.&quot;
</font>
<p>

<li> &quot;Recovery&quot; does not mean rebuilding
your health, mind, body, and life while not drinking; it means going to
A.A. meetings, doing The Twelve Steps, and
abstaining from alcohol. According to A.A. dogma, someone can't be
recovering from alcohol if he isn't going
to A.A. meetings and doing The Twelve Steps; he's &quot;only
abstaining&quot;.
<p>
<li> By the same broken logic, he's &quot;only dry&quot;
but not &quot;sober&quot;.
According to A.A., you can't enjoy a period of &quot;sobriety&quot;
without going to A.A. meetings.

Thus, a cultish A.A. member can ask someone,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Do you really

In March of 2013, the small island nation of Cyprus went into a financial crisis. The banks of Cyprus
had been acting as low-tax bankers for organized crime in Russia and Mideastern drug traffickers. Hence they
had a lot of cash to invest. The Cypriot banks made the giant mistake of investing
heavily in high-yield Greek bonds, which suddenly became nearly worthless when
the Greek economy crashed. So the banks were bankrupt and deeply in debt.
<p>
The EU and Cypriot leaders proposed seizing roughly 8 or 10% of everybody's money in the Cypriot banks
to repay the mobsters. The people of Cyprus rebelled, and the Cypriot parliament voted the idea down.
<p>
So, on March 25th, the powers that were came up with a new answer, which involved a &quot;haircut&quot; on
bank accounts that held more than 100,000 Euros that would confiscate up to 40% of the money
in those accounts.
The New York Times reported that, &quot;the deal would scrap the highly controversial
idea of a tax on bank deposits, although it would still require forced losses for
depositors and bondholders.&quot; Say, what? In fact, there is no material difference
between the so-called &quot;tax&quot; and the &quot;forced losses.&quot; That was just semantics.

<p>
No matter what you call it, the banks were still violating a sacred trust and
stealing depositors' money with the excuse of &quot;We need your money, so we are taking it,&quot;
(and that caused a panic where people quickly withdrew their money from banks all over Europe).
Never before had the &quot;masters of finance&quot; in Europe declared that they could just take money
from people because they wanted it.

<li> <b>Pigeon-holing and Labeling</b><br>
This error in thought comes from stuffing people and things into simplistic categories
 &#8212;  &quot;pigeon-holes&quot;  &#8212; and assigning inaccurate names to them.  
This can be done without malice, and yet, it still results in erroneous thoughts and wrong
conclusions.
<p>
Many simple-minded people want to stuff everything that they don't understand into
some simple pigeon-hole, and then they believe that they know what it is.

<p>
People have a natural tendency to want to name things. Once they learn the name of something,
they assume that they know what it is. Wrong. They simply have a word, a label. They still do not
know what it is. And they don't know whether the name is an accurate description of the thing.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous does an outrageous job of pigeon-holing and labeling people:
<ul>
<li> You are an alcoholic.
<li> You are an addict.
<li> You are a dry drunk.
<li> You are a bleeding deacon.
<li> You are just a bitter, angry old ingrate.
<li> You are unspiritual.
<li> You are spiritual.
<li> You are <i>Working A Strong Program</i>.

A commercial for a get-rich-quick scheme says that the cost of the scheme

&quot;You can take it out of your cash flow.&quot;</font><br>
Wrong. You do not deduct expenses from &quot;cash flow&quot;.
Expenses come straight out of your
<i>profits</i>, and if you don't have any profits, then you are
suffering a financial loss, no matter how large your cash flow is,
and the cost of that get-rich-quick scheme will be
part of your loss. In fact, if you don't have profits, then
&quot;cash flow&quot; becomes your enemy &#8212; it turns into
&quot;burn rate&quot; &#8212; the rate at which you are burning
up your cash reserves and heading for bankruptcy.
<p>
A TV evangelist's commercial declares that you can get his &quot;free&quot; book

of merchandise, not an exchange of gifts.

<p>
Similarly, George W. Bush calls his attack on Iraq &quot;a war for freedom&quot;.
Every time Rumsfeld attacks another city like Fallujah or Najaf or Kut or Sadr City
and kills several hundred more people, including women and children,
Bush says that it's a victory for &quot;freedom&quot;.
<p>
Bush also calls the rebels against American hegemony &quot;the enemies of freedom&quot;.
No, they really want to be free &#8212; especially free from our army in their country.
<p>
Bush says that they hate us because of our &quot;freedom&quot;.
No, they hate us because our military forces are destroying their country and
killing their children with our &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; bombing.



<p><br>
<a name="misuse_words"> </a>
<li> <b>Misuse Words</b><br>
Blithely give words a completely different meaning than their usual or
commonly-accepted ones.
<p>
For example, Bill Wilson wrote this deceptive propaganda while trying
to convert people to his religious beliefs (and while
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">
pretending to be a converted agnostic</a>):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Logic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not by
chance we were given the power to reason, to examine the evidence
of our senses, and to draw conclusions. That is one of man's
magnificent attributes. We agnostically inclined would not feel
satisfied with a proposal which does not lend itself to reasonable
approach and interpretation. Hence we are at pains to tell why
we think our present faith is reasonable, why we think it more
sane and logical to believe, why we say our former thinking was
soft and mushy when we threw up our hands in doubt and said,
&quot;We don't know.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions,
William G. Wilson, Page 53.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There, Bill Wilson misused the word &quot;logical&quot;.
There is nothing &quot;logical&quot; about
blind faith in a cult religion. Logic is a thought process where one examines
facts and then draws conclusions from them, using inductive or deductive reasoning.
It is not &quot;more sane and logical&quot; to stop thinking critically, and just
blindly believe in Bill Wilson's religion.

<p>
Bill was also using the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#bait_switch" target="_blank">hypnotic bait-and-switch trick</a>.
He started the paragraph by praising logic and saying that he liked it.
But then he switched sides and attacked logic, and praised blind faith
<i>in his beliefs</i> as being more &quot;logical&quot; than logic itself.
<p>
And it's almost funny how Bill admitted that he was
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;at pains to tell why we think our present faith is reasonable,
why we think it more sane and logical to believe...&quot;</font>
The reason that it is so hard to defend that point of view is because
it is completely irrational and illogical. It is based on no facts at all.
It is just so much wishful thinking.

<p>
Likewise, George W. Bush misuses words like &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;civil liberties&quot;
while he claims that he has the right to spy on people without a judge
signing off on the surveillance.
Bush says that he is careful of people's &quot;civil liberties&quot;
while he spies on American citizens without a court warrant.
<p>
Wrong.
<p>
The Constitutional protection of the American people from the searches
of an intrusive dishonest politician is not &quot;freedom&quot; or
&quot;liberty&quot;; it is a Constitutional protection.
&quot;Civil liberties&quot; are things like the rights of the citizens to
gather together and speak in protest against Bush's actions &#8212;
something that George W. Bush does not allow anywhere around him.
The protesters are confined to &quot;free speech zones&quot; that are far away
from Bush.
<p>
(By the way, the whole of the United States of America is a Free Speech Zone.
George W. Bush should learn that while he is pretending to protect and uphold
the Constitution of the United States.)

<a name="moving_goalposts"> </a>
<li> <b>Moving The Goalposts</b><br>
<p>
This trick is like:

<li> Demand that your opponent prove Fact A.
<li> When he does, answer, &quot;But you didn't prove Fact B.&quot;
<li> When he does that, answer &quot;&quot;But you didn't prove Fact C.&quot;
<li> etc...
</ol>
<p>
This trick is also known as &quot;changing the parameters of the question afterwards&quot;,
so as to invalidate a true answer. And it's also called &quot;moving the bar&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
For example,
<font color="#4f007f">

<p>
The mental diversion was, of course, to assert that harm reduction programs fail because
they do not enforce absolute abstinence from drugs or alcohol. But that was never the
goal of harm-reduction programs.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters90.html#51_weeks" target="_blank">Dr. and Prof. George E. Vaillant
used the same technique</a> in his analysis of
Alcoholics-Anonymous-based treatment in
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>.
Alcoholics Anonymous insists that members must
<i>totally</i> abstain from drinking alcohol, and if a member drinks even one single
drink, then he looses all of his sober time and immediately starts over at zero.
But when Dr. Vaillant tested Alcoholics
Anonymous, he found that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the results were &quot;appalling&quot;</a>,
so Dr. Vaillant  changed his definition
of &quot;sobriety&quot; to &quot;sober for 51 weeks out of the year&quot;, so that some people could be
scored as &quot;in stable remission for 3 years&quot;.
That's moving the goalposts to make the results look better.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses the <i>Moving the Goalposts</i> trick very often. The whole A.A. program
is a Move-the-Goalposts routine:
<p>
<ul>
<li> In the beginning, the advertised goal of the A.A. program is to quit drinking and save your life.
<li> But if someone quits drinking without embracing Bill Wilson's version of Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion, then the A.A. true believers complain that the newly-sober alcoholic has not
&quot;found God&quot;, and he isn't &quot;working a strong program&quot;.
<li> Then they will complain that the beginner has not &quot;Worked The Steps&quot; properly, and
he hasn't listed and confessed all of his sins in Steps 4 and 5, &quot;holding nothing back.&quot;
<li> And he has not &quot;surrendered to God&quot;.
<li> And he has not rid himself of all &quot;resentments&quot; and anger.
<li> And he isn't correctly hearing God in Step 11.  
</ul>
<p>
That is a lot  more to do than just quit drinking.

<p><br>
<a name="low_expectations"> </a>
<li> <b>Set Low Expections</b><br>
Prepare the audience for poor results by setting expectations very low, so that
whatever happens, it seems better than they expected.
<p>
Corporate executives use this stunt on Wall Street financial analysts all of the time.
They cry to the analysts that business conditions are really tough right now,
the economy is bad this quarter, and the results won't
be very good, so that the analysts predict a low profit-per-share for the current
quarter. Then, when the company produces results that are better than expected,
the stock price soars.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous uses the same stunt to explain away the bad behavior of
A.A. members.
An often-repeated slogan is &quot;We are not saints.&quot; Thus, anything from
dealing drugs to other A.A. members, to helping oneself
to the collection basket, to sexually exploiting the attractive young women who
come to A.A. seeking help with a drug or alcohol problem is okay, and easily
explained, because &quot;We are not saints.&quot;
<p>
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html#no_rules" target="_blank">One A.A. apologist
actually argued</a>
that it was wrong to demand moral behavior
from rapist A.A. members &#8212; to demand that the sexual predators in A.A.
stop raping the young female newcomers &#8212; because that would be
 setting expectations too high:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<p>
The problem with what you are doing is that A.A. is a place for sick people
to get well. For alcoholics to come recover. It is not a place for nice
kind folk to become saints.

<p>
If you start making behavior rules, which is in essence exactly what you
are trying to do, where does it end? Do you really think people are
trying to condone illicit behavior?

<p> 
No, that is not what people are saying. What they are saying is that
&quot;no matter how far down the scale&quot; you have gone, you are
welcome in A.A. If you don't change, well, you won't stick around.
You are welcome to come, but why would you? A.A. is for the sick trying
to get well, and if you aren't interested in getting well, you won't be
around long. That is why the traditions state 'there is no A.A. police'.
Get it? That is why A.A. members &#8212; and I live in PA &#8212; have a hard time
listening to you.

<p>
If you start trying to make a list of unacceptable behavior, you are
essentially making a list of rules for membership, of which there aren't
any and hopefully never will be. I fail to see how you can not comprehend
this. Our fellowship can not deny even the most unsavory of individuals.
Even in the midst of their lowest points, they are welcome.

<p>
That is the only requirement for A.A. membership, not the only law. 
The &quot;A.A. 12 Traditions&quot; <i>do not</i> say that the only RULE
that A.A. members must obey in life is &quot;a desire to quit drinking&quot;.
There are still other rules that are expected of all people: don't rape,
 don't rob, don't murder...
A.A. does not get to suspend those rules because &quot;We are not saints&quot;.

<a name="sliding_adjectives"> </a>
<li> <b>Sliding Adjectives</b><br>
Use a sequence of descriptors, usually adjectives, where the value, quality, and
characteristics of what is being described slip and slide from one thing
to another, often to the exact opposite.

For example:

<li> genuine pictures of a fake artifact

<p><br>
<a name="vague_adjectives"> </a>
<li> <b>Vague Adjectives</b><br>
Use adjectives that sound good but don't really tell us what they mean.
For example, advertisements for a store offered:
<ul>
<li> &quot;the top digital cameras&quot;
<li> &quot;top plasma and LCD TVs&quot;
<li> &quot;popular furniture&quot;
</ul>
<p>
In the first two examples, does the word &quot;top&quot; mean that the equipment is high-quality, or
that they are best-sellers? Best-sellers are usually inexpensive and hence low quality.
<p>
The third example more clearly describes best-sellers, but that still does not show that
the furniture is actually any good, or worth buying. Attempts to stampede you into buying something
because everybody else is buying it is just another recycling of the old propaganda trick
<a href="#everybody">
<i>&quot;Everybody knows, everybody says, everybody is doing it&quot;</i></a>,
also known as &quot;The Bandwagon&quot;.

A spam email advertised: &quot;Strong Programs for Real Estate Risks&quot;.
Excuse me? What the heck is a &quot;strong program&quot;?
They continued, &quot;HOW STRONG ARE YOUR LINKS?&quot;

They continued: &quot;Discover how our expanding line of comprehensive programs and products can protect your clients from a multitude of real estate exposures at the industry’s most competitive rates.

Ah, so they want me to sell insurance for them.


<p><br>
<a name="undefined"> </a>
<li> <b>Undefined Terms</b><br>
Use words that sound good or bad but are not actually defined and have no concrete meaning.

<p>
For example, a TV commercial for a tooth whitener declares that your teeth will be
&quot;nine shades whiter in only ten days.&quot;
So what is a shade of white? How much of a change in color is &quot;a shade&quot;.
How much whiter will your teeth actually be?
You would think that maybe some artists' institute or the National Bureau
of Standards would have a formal definition of &quot;shade&quot;, or
some color charts to show what is a &quot;shade of white&quot;, but
they don't. A shade of white could be anything.
So no matter what happens from use of the tooth whitener, the advertiser can claim,
&quot;What? You can't see any difference? Your eyes just
aren't sensitive enough. Believe me, your teeth are definitely nine shades whiter.&quot;

<p>
Bill Wilson used this technique in the <i>Big Book</i> constantly.
His sermons and lectures were non-stop streams of grandiose, undefined terms.
For example, Bill declared that atheists and agnostics would get
&quot;results&quot; if they just started believing in his religion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We found that as soon as we were able
to lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a
Power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though
it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that Power,
which is God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>We Agnostics</i>, Page 46.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
We commenced to get what results?
Was it quitting drinking? Was it longer periods of sobriety
between relapses? Was it simply drinking less per day?
Who knows what &quot;results&quot; they got?
Bill doesn't say. We have to just take his word for it that
some kind of benefits accrued because people believed something.<br>

<font color="blue">
(Heck, Bill didn't even really say that the results were good, did he?
He just said that they &quot;commenced to get results&quot;.
The results could have been that they all got drunk and
partied their brains out.)<br>
</font>

Likewise, Bill Wilson declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Language&quot; and &quot;Double-talk&quot;,
but this one has a flavor all its own.
It is particularly prevalent around universities, and lives in
scholarly journals, and is a favorite tool of intellectual wanna-bees.
<p>

This example of pseudo-intellectual bull is
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland" target="_blank">Dr. Carl G. Jung</a>,
telling us how to get a spiritual experience:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The only right and legitimate way to such an experience is that it
happens to you in reality and it can only happen to you when you walk
on a path which leads you to higher understanding. You might be led
to that goal by an act of grace or through a personal and honest contact
with friends, or through a higher education of the mind beyond the
confines of mere rationalism.<br>

Adam Rafalovich wrote an exemplary piece of such pseudo-intellectual
bull that attempted to posit that Narcotics Anonymous meetings actually
work and have positive effects on ex-addicts:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Embedded within the interplay of these moments of recovering-addict
identity is a technique of identity transformation I refer to as
false working. False working denotes a mechanism by which NA members
are given permission to &quot;act as if&quot; they truly believe
in the NA
message regardless of their real sentiments. This technique is
exemplified by the aphorism <i>Fake it 'til you make it.</i>
False working
proves to be a crucial component for the NA organization to maintain
long-term membership and recruit new, skeptical members.<br>

<p>
<font color="black">
In other words, lie and fake it and pretend to be getting great
results from <i>&quot;working the program&quot;</i>,
to fool the newcomers into believing
that the voodoo medicine 12-Step routine really works.
Such deceit is useful for what the author calls
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_cloning" target="_blank">identity
transformation</a>&quot; &#8212; converting newcomers into good cult members.
Note that the author says that such deceit and fakery is even
&quot;a crucial component&quot; in keeping the old-timers coming back.
So everybody is deceiving everybody else, all of the time.
Everybody is re-enacting <i>&quot;The Emperor's New Clothes&quot;</i>.

<p>
Note the stilted language and the euphemisms that disguise the real meaning
of Rafalovich's statements.
Instead of saying, &quot;lie and deceive&quot;, the author uses
the phrases,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;false working&quot;</i></font> and
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;permission to 'act as if' they truly believe in the
NA message&quot;</i></font>.

The author, Adam Rafalovich, gave us many more examples of this
pseudo-intellectual bull technique in that article. A few more of them:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Standing most significant in the literature today is the
concept of
narrative and its effect in creating group cohesion inside and
outside 12-Step meetings.
It is believed in the study of 12-Step recovery processes that the
mutual disclosures of members fosters processes of belonging and
commitment to the collective goal of drug and alcohol
abstinence. &nbsp; ...<br>
In addition, the study of story presentation has been shown to be
integral in developing moral attachments to a collectivity.&quot;<br>

In other words, use the standard cult recruiting technique of
<i><a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_testimonies" target="_blank">Personal Testimonies of Earlier Converts</a></i>
to fool <!-- the thinking of --> the newcomers and suck them into the cult.
Much of the &quot;sharing&quot; is just sales pitches telling
newcomers to join the group and <i>Keep Coming Back</i>.
<p>
And Rafalovich uses
<a href="#passive_voice" target="_blank">the passive voice</a> technique to assert unsupported claims:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It is believed ... that the mutual disclosures of members fosters processes...&quot;<br>

&quot;By examining the contents of common NA testimony, we can examine
data that demonstrate that individual action is as much a result of
the NA organization as it is a contributor to it. Therefore when
positing a theory of the recovering-addict identity process, it is
important to acknowledge the internalization of an organization as
a result of becoming a contributor. Interestingly, NA members
realize this theoretical notion. Contribution, for example, is a
strong ethic within the organization; it is believed that to not
participate in the narrative environment (i.e., not share during
meetings) will harm one's chances of continued abstinence.&quot;<br>

In other words, the way to become one of the group is to start
talking the talk in meetings, and telling people that the program
is working for you.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#act_as_if" target="_blank">Fake It Until You Make It</a>.&quot;</i>
</font>
The more you do it, the more it will warp your
thinking and make you feel and act like one of the old-timers.
<p>
That is a use of the 
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_cognitive" target="_blank"><i>cognitive dissonance</i> technique</a> &#8212;
Since you don't want
to think of yourself as a lying fake, you will start to imagine that
you <i>really are</i> getting some great results, just like
you have been saying...
Your subconscious mind will struggle to minimize the pain of the conflict
between believing that it is wrong to lie, and the group requirement that you say that
you are getting great results from the program &#8212; and <i>coming to believe</i> that the
program <i>really IS working</i> for you, and that you are telling the truth,
is the subconscious mind's answer to the problem.
<p>
It's really a very common brainwashing and mind-control technique:<br>
<font color="#df0000">
&quot;Makem' say it enough times, and they'll start to believe it.&quot;<br>
&quot;Makem' go through the motions enough times, and they'll start to
think that such behavior is normal.&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
And, the author tells us,
if you should choose to not engage in such cultish behavior, and do not
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#act_as_if" target="_blank">Fake It Until You Make It</a>&quot;</i></font>,
then you just might leave the cult and not come back.
<font color="#9F0000">(No surprise there.)</font>
<p>
Also note the use of two other propaganda techniques in this one line:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;it is believed that to not participate in the narrative environment
(i.e., not share during meetings) will harm one's chances of continued
abstinence.&quot;</font><br>
There, we get
<ol>
<li> <a href="#passive_voice">the use of the passive voice</a>, yet again,
citing the opinions of some more invisible, unnamed people, and
<li> <a href="#emotions">fear mongering</a>
</ol>
<p>
<ol>
<li> It is believed by whom?  Says who?
<li> Where is the evidence that anybody should believe such nonsense?
<li> What medical or scientific study, survey, or poll showed that telling
lies in N.A. meetings &#8212; <i>faking it 'till you make it</i> &#8212; reduces
drug consumption, or reduces relapses?
<li> Where is the evidence that refusing to lie and deceive increases drug addiction?
</ol>
<p>
There is no evidence to support such illogical statements.
The author tries to shove that cult dogma at us as established fact by
declaring that some unnamed people believe it to be true.

And it's also the cult practice of:

Rafalovich says that the program is <i>&quot;ultimately aimed at fostering a stronger
<a href="orange-not_good.html#dependency" target="_blank">dependency upon the group</a>.&quot;</i>
That is really insidious cult behavior.
They want you to become dependent on the cult for everything.
The cult will become your entire social circle, and your family,
and your whole life.
You will end up needing the cult to tell you who you are, and what you should
think and what you should do.
That produces mental cripples who cannot live outside of the cult.
That is not 'recovery'.

credence to the relative instability of the addict identity.
It is not a technique reserved strictly for those who are new to

There just isn't anything quite like a nice, short, snappy slogan.

Slogans can just cut through the fog and grab people's hearts and

A good slogan can make or break a politician's campaign:<br>

Adolf Hitler instructed:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must
be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is
addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to
reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be.
But if, as in propaganda for sticking out a war, the aim is to
influence a whole people, we must avoid excessive intellectual
demands on our public, and too much caution cannot be exerted
in this direction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The more modest its intellectual ballast, the more exclusively
it takes into consideration the emotions of the masses, the more
effective it will be. &nbsp; &nbsp; 
... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is a mistake to make propaganda many-sided, like scientific instruction,
for instance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The receptivity of the great masses is very limited,
their intelligence is small, but their power of forgetting is enormous.
In consequence of these facts, all effective
propaganda must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans
until the last member of the public understands what you want him to understand
by your slogan.<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous grossly over-simplifies the problems of alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
(And Narcotics Anonymous also over-simplifies the issue of drug addiction.)
A.A. tries to reduce those problems to just a matter of &quot;resentments&quot; and
unconfessed sins
causing &quot;spiritual diseases&quot;, and &quot;ego&quot; and &quot;self-will&quot; causing
&quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;.
And the cure is supposedly to &quot;work a strong program&quot;, and &quot;surrender to God&quot;,
and do the 12 Steps and attend lots of meetings.
<p>
A.A. totally ignores the problem of mental illnesses like Bipolar Disorder and schizophrenia
causing people to drink too much alcohol and take too many drugs.
And A.A. rarely, if ever, sends people to real doctors and psychiatrists to get those problems fixed.

religiosity, like Alcoholics Anonymous does, also works.

<li> <b>Claim Causation By A Higher Power</b><br>

Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's fawning Minister of Propaganda, declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Destiny has sent us this man [Adolf Hitler] so that we, in this time of great

Likewise, when he heard that President Roosevelt had died, another of Hitler's boot-lickers declared:
<p>
<blockquote>

<font color="blue"><i>
The Angel of History? I recall Michael, and Gabriel, and Lucifer, and The Angel of Death,
and several others, but can't seem to remember any &quot;Angel of History&quot;...
</i></font>
<p>
That sounds a lot like Karl Marx's mystical &quot;Force of History&quot; that was
supposed to spontaneously bring us a Worker's Paradise. (In spite of his declarations of atheism,
Karl Marx was actually a muddled-headed mystic who believed in Higher Powers or
Higher Forces that just magically made things happen, and determined the course of history.)

The individual who clings tenaciously to unverified beliefs confuses
his beliefs with fact, and often inflicts this confusion on others
in his struggle to resolve it in his favor.
When many people are persuaded to subscribe to the same pretense, of course,
it can gain the aura of objectivity; as British psychoanalyst Ron Britton
has observed, &quot;we can substitute concurrence for reality testing, and so
shared phantasy can gain the same or even greater status than knowledge.&quot;
The belief doesn't become a fact, but the fact of shared belief
lends it the valuable appearance of credibility. The belief is codified,
takes hold, and rises above the level where it might be questioned.<br>

A variation on this technique is rationalizing one's own behavior by claiming that:
<ul>
<li> It's what everybody does.
<li> That's just how it's done.
<li> It's normal.
<li> It's standard operating procedure.
<li> It's customary.
<li> It's standard practice in the industry.
<li> It's accepted practice.
</ul>

<p>
You can stampede large masses
of people into following a certain course of action if they think
it's what everybody else is doing, or will do.
We see an amusing example of this most every Christmas, when one
particular toy, like a <i>Furby</i> or a <i>Cabbage Patch Doll</i>,
becomes the fad toy of the season,
and all of the children <i>simply must</i> get one because everybody
else (all of the other children) is getting one.
The parents go nuts trying to find one as the supply sells out and
a bidding war sets in, and the parents often have little real idea
of what it is they are trying to get. All they know is that it's what
the kids want. All that the kids know is that it's what everybody
else wants.
<p>
The human and social pressures to conform to the group are very strong.
People often conform to the group even without realizing it, or
admitting it. Some people fancy themselves non-conformists, but they
almost always simply adopt an alternate fashion of dress, hair style,
speech, and behavior. You can tell who the &quot;non-conformists&quot;
are by which uniform they wear.
<p>
In fact, to be a &quot;real non-conformist&quot;, you have to
conform and wear the uniform.
If you simply dress and act any way you want to, people will
just regard you as a weirdo.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
For more than 20 years that I can remember, McDonald's has been
advertising that it is simply <i>The</i> place where everybody eats
burgers. The commercials tell our children, &quot;It's just the
regular American Way. Everybody is doing it.&quot;
Not to be left behind, Dairy Queen has launched a series of commercials
that tries to convince us that we should just refer to Dairy Queen
as &quot;D.Q.&quot;, as if eating at Dairy Queen is so commonplace
that everybody will immediately know what you mean when you just
say &quot;D.Q.&quot;. So far, that phony chummy familiarity does not
seem to have caught on, probably because people know that it's phony
and resent the attempt at manipulation of their feelings.
Oh well, better luck with the next advertising campaign.

<p>
<li>
In a wicked twist on this psychology, organizations like Microsoft or
political special interest groups have been caught sponsoring phony &quot;grass roots
campaigns&quot; where long tables of tired, frowzy grandmothers were
paid to hand write a river of &quot;spontaneous&quot; letters that supported
some particular position that their employer liked...
The numerous letters were supposed to show that <i>everybody</i> favors the
sponsor's position.

<p>
<li>
On television, advertisements for two TV shows declare that
&quot;Everybody is talking about...&quot; and &quot;All of America is talking about...&quot;
(Oddly, I had never watched either stupid show and none of my friends said anything about them either.)

<p>
<li>
<a name="ftnt06_ret"> </a>
The &quot;Moonies&quot; &#8212; the members of the Unification Church of
Rev. Sun Myung Moon
&#8212; use the &quot;Everybody's Doing It&quot;
technique in their recruiting and indoctrination routines.
Newcomers are invited to lectures or workshops, where they are
exposed to Unification Church doctrines like <i>The Divine Principle</i>.
The Moonies always
<a href="#pack_the_house">pack the audience</a> with committed true-believer
members, making sure that the audience is always more than 50%
enthusiastic members, and then they arrange the seating so that
each newcomer has an old member on both sides of him.
To the newcomer, it seems like the doctrines of the Unification
Church must be brilliant, because everybody else is really wowed and
amazed at how clear and logical it all
is...<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font>

<p>
<li>
Politicians love to use that stunt too. Richard Nixon and gang
packed the gallery at the 1972 Republican National Convention
with clean-cut photogenic Young Republican college kids
who had been specially bussed in just for the occasion,
just so that they could be seen on TV cheering for Nixon &#8212;
just showing the American people that it wasn't only the
old fascists who loved Nixon...

<a name="Bush15"> </a>

In 2004, George W. Bush is using a variation on this stunt:
He appears before crowds that are &quot;mostly friendly, invited
guests&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt16">16</a></sup></font>
Well that gets rid of the hecklers and the critics, doesn't it?

<p>
<li>
Another recent example was on <i>Meet The Press</i> (NBC TV).
Steven Hadley, President G. W. Bush's National Security
Advisor, declared on 3 December 2006 that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I think the American people understand the cost
of failure...&quot;</font>
(So let's all do what George wants.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No matter how many Americans understand the cost of failure, there is no evidence that the American
people want to see more of their sons' lives wasted in a disastrous misadventure.
There is no evidence that the American people agree with George.
The results of the last election declare that the American people really do understand the cost of
failure, and they are tired of George Bush's failures.

Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and Al-Anon use this
<i>Everybody's Doing It</i> and <i>Everybody Knows</i> technique often:
<ul>
<li> Everybody recovers through x.A..
<li> Everybody knows that x.A. works, and has saved millions of lives.
<li> Everybody who ever overcame an alcohol or drug addiction did it by doing the Twelve Steps.
<li> Everybody goes to meetings.
<li> Everybody <i><b>needs to go</b></i> to meetings.
<li> Everybody knows that the answer to every crisis in life is
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Get to a meeting, as fast as possible.&quot;</font></i>
<li> Everybody knows that x.A. members are the experts on addiction.
<li> Everybody is just taking it &quot;One Day At A Time.&quot;
<li> Everybody is in recovery.
<li> Everybody knows that the Twelve Steps work, and that all of the
x.A. religious dogma is true.
<li> Everybody knows that x.A. is
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">&quot;spiritual&quot;, not religious</a>.
<li> Everybody knows that x.A. is the only way.
<li> Everybody knows that newcomer alcoholics and addicts are all
<i>&quot;in denial&quot;</i>, and if they object to anything
about the &quot;spiritual&quot; 12-Step program, it is just
their addiction talking.

<li> Everybody knows that the best thing you can do with an alcoholic
or drug addict is force him to go to x.A..

<a href="#teaspoons">by not quite telling them the truth</a>&quot;</font>.)</i>
</font>
</ul>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous also makes good use of the social pressures to
conform to the group.
If A.A. can just make people <i>Keep Coming Back</i>, then
those people will eventually get worn down and converted to believing
what everybody else is believing. They will end up saying and doing
what everybody else is saying and doing.
It's just human nature.

<p>
The flip side of the <i>&quot;Everybody's Doing It&quot;</i> coin is
<i>&quot;Nobody Is Doing It.&quot;</i>
If you don't see it on TV, then it isn't real. If you don't
hear an idea espoused on TV, then that idea must be radical
or extremist, and can't be true.

For instance, the CIA didn't really

giving them LSD without their knowledge.

<p>
Likewise, television and the movies always portray
Alcoholics Anonymous in a positive
light, with movies like <i>&quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;, &quot;Clean
and Sober&quot;, &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;</i>,
and <i>&quot;28 Days&quot;</i>, and positive portrayals
in TV programs like <i>&quot;Cagney and Lacy&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-letters13.html#ER" target="_blank">ER</a>&quot;</i>
and
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-random.html#West_Wing" target="_blank">The West Wing</a>&quot;</i>.
Nobody on TV ever says that A.A. is actually a stupid superstitious
cult religion that is completely ineffective for treating alcoholism,
so that can't possibly be true.

It was difficult for those present to not be emotionally affected and,
indeed, Diana and Unity [Mitford] were not the only visitors impressed by the
showmanship of Hitler's party.  Many young Englishmen who visited Germany in the
first part of that decade were moved to support Hitler's regime, even though later
some came to despise it.  In a recent television documentary examining the attraction
of Hitler to the youth of Europe at that time, Nigel Nicholson was just one who
stated that he was thoroughly hooked: 'The catchy "<i>Horst Wessel</i>" song, the marching,
the torches, the singing and tramping of boots &#8212; I <i>was</i>, at that time, a Hitler
youth,' he said.  Michael Burn was another 'I wrote home, "I cannot think coherently
&#8212; it is so wonderful what Hitler has brought this country back to..."'
He recalls that he was 'stunned and excited by the cohesion of Germany after
the political disunion in Britain.  Then there was the theatre of Nuremberg:
'great lights in the sky, moving music, the rhetoric, the presentation, timing,
performance, soundtrack, exultation and climax.  It was almost aimed at the
sexual parts of one's consciousness.'<br>

The interesting thing about pomp, ceremony, and ritual is that it
has an irrational appeal. You are asked to accept an organization
and its whole package of beliefs and dogma and activities based on beautiful costumes,
magnificent surroundings, rituals, ceremonies,
and dramatic productions &#8212; things that have absolutely nothing
to do with whether it is a good or bad organization,
has a good or a bad agenda, or has a good or a bad leader.
<p>
You shouldn't choose your religion or your politics on the basis
of who has the most colorful costumes or the most entertaining
ceremonies, but a lot of people do.
<p>
A variation on this technique is lots of hoopla, fun, parties, spiritual jet-setting,
get-togethers, conventions, and conferences.

Alcoholics Anonymous has lots of ceremonies and rituals &#8212; every
meeting is a ceremony where people practice rituals like incanting
the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and praying out loud, as
well as reciting several other pieces of standard church dogma at the
start of every meeting.

Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), the ceremonies of A.A. are not
nearly as dramatic or colorful as those of the Nazis or the Moonies.

<a name="humor"> </a>
<li> <b>Humor and Ridicule</b><br>

Satire is a time-honored political weapon, and a devastating one. Few
pompous, stuffed-shirt politicians or other phony leaders can stand much
of it. A good joke can be deadlier than a gun when it comes to killing off
bad politicians.

<p>
Unfortunately, Alcoholics Anonymous doesn't have any good jokes about
itself.
A.A. pretends to have a lot of humor by laughing and joking about
everything and anything except the stuff that really matters &#8212; like
the faults and shortcomings of A.A. itself.
A.A. claims to have rules like,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Rule #62: Don't take yourself too damn seriously.&quot;</font>
<font size="-1">(<a href="#12X12">12X12</a>, page 149.)</font>
<p>
But what that really means is,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;You can and should put yourself down, and tell jokes
about yourself, and laugh at how stupid you are, but
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_no_humor" target="_blank">don't you dare ridicule
A.A. or its doctrines, or its founders</a>.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="blue">

tell them <a href="orange-jokes.html" target="_blank">my jokes about A.A.</a>...
Too bad; they are missing out on some fun.)
</font>


<p><br>
<a name="assume"> </a>
<li> <b>Assume The Major Premise</b><br>

People's minds have this peculiarity: Only the most thoughtful of
listeners examine major premises &#8212; the premises upon which an
argument is based. When a doubtful assertion is made, most people
will plunge into arguing about the assertion without further thought
about the underlying assumptions.
<p>
For example: in the early part of World War Two, before the U.S.A.
had gotten into the war, the Nazis desired to convince the American
people that Germany would defeat Britain and win the war. But if
they had stated such an idea directly, it would have aroused the
suspicions of the American people, who would have argued the point.
<p>
So, what the Nazis did was spread many stories and arguments about
how the U.S.A. should go ahead and trade with a victorious Germany
after the war was over:<br>

<ul>
<li> &quot;Whether we like Hitler or not, we will have to deal
with him.&quot;<br>

<li> &quot;If the Nazis win, let's not be sentimental &#8212;
business is business. It is all an imperialist war anyway.&quot;<br>

<li> &quot;Europe is just too big for us to ignore, and
not trade with, even if Germany is running the whole thing.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
The listeners may have immediately launched into arguments over whether we
should trade with Germany, but few challenged the underlying assumption,
the major premise, that Germany would defeat Great Britain.
<p>
Another example:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Why does America have the best government in the world?&quot;<br>
</i></font>
No evidence has been supplied to support the idea that the United States
(not &quot;America&quot;) has the best government.
Many European democracies from Denmark and Sweden to Switzerland would challenge that arrogant assumption.

In March of 2005, we are seeing the use of this technique of assuming
the major premise in the tragic case of Terri Schiavo, a woman who
14 years earlier suffered a heart attack that stopped the flow of blood
to her brain that caused most of her brain to die.
Her husband favors stopping life support and letting her go, but
Terri's parents and brother (the Schindler family)
constantly talk about &quot;saving her&quot;
and &quot;keeping her alive&quot; by
re-inserting the feeding tube. That is assuming a fact that has not
been established &#8212; that her brain is still alive &#8212; that she can be saved.
<p>
Her brother has even gone so far in his sadly deluded wishful thinking
as to interpret some of her moans as speech declaring that she
&quot;wants to live&quot;.
That is <i>really</i> assuming a lot. Her moans of &quot;Aaaah waaaah&quot; could
just as easily mean &quot;I want you to leave me alone and let me die&quot; (although
in truth they don't really mean anything at all).
<p>
Those who favor keeping Terri on life support call it &quot;judicial
murder&quot; for the courts to order the feeding tube to be removed
in compliance with her husband's wishes.
And out in the streets, protesters campaign for the governor or congressmen
or judges or the President to &quot;save the life of Terri&quot;.
<p>
What all of those activists erroneously assume is the major premise &#8212;
that Terri Schiavo can in fact &quot;be saved&quot; and be &quot;kept alive&quot;
and that she actually is alive and has a functioning brain &#8212; that there
is something or somebody left in that body to save.
But 14 years of debates and court cases and doctors' examinations and
medical tests, as well as the failure of Terri's medical condition to
improve in 14 years,
have shown beyond a shadow of a doubt that the higher parts of her brain
died and liquefied a long time ago, and that she isn't in there any more.
There is nobody left to save. The real Terri Schiavo died 14 years ago.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
[Update: June 2005: The autopsy of Terri Schiavo revealed that her brain had been
hopelessly destroyed, and she was brain-dead for 14 years.]
</i></font>

<p>
(Also note that somebody is using the propaganda technique of
<a href="#observational"><i>Observational Selection</i></a> on you when they
choose what you will see on television.
Out of the many, many hours of videotapes that the Schindler family has made,
you get to see only a few seconds of images that appear to show Terry
Schaivo reacting to her environment or responding to people stroking
her face. But a judge who watched 14 hours of the videotapes concluded that
she was not aware of her surroundings, and that she was not reacting
to stimuli in any conscious manner.)

<p>
For another example of &quot;assuming the major premise&quot;,
at Narcotics Anonymous meetings, the group secretary always asks:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Can we see a show of hands of those who have a year or more
of clean time to show that this program works?&quot;</font><br>
They never ask,<br>

<li> <b><i>Petitio Principii</i> &#8212; Assume Facts Not In Evidence</b><br>

<i>Petitio Principii</i> is similar to &quot;Assume the major premise&quot;.
<p>
<i>Petitio Principii</i> is &quot;a logical fallacy in which a premise is assumed to be
true without warrant, or in which what is to be proved is implicitly
taken for granted.&quot; In court, lawyers will scream,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Objection, Your Honor! The counsel is assuming facts not in evidence!&quot;

and Capricorns don't believe in astrology.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="question_states"> </a>
Another facet of &quot;<i>Petitio Principii</i>&quot; is asking
questions that are really veiled statements. One of the most famous
examples of that is the question, &quot;Have you stopped beating
your wife yet?&quot; It doesn't matter whether you answer yes or no,
you are confessing to having beaten your wife.
<p>
One of the most annoying things about religious recruiters and proselytizers is how they assume
that you are a hopeless sinner, before even bothering to ask about your actual spiritual condition.
Their tracts advertise &quot;How To Get On Target&quot;, without asking where you are currently aimed.
They just assume that you are a disgusting sinner, headed for perdition,
going to Hell in a bucket.
(And they rationalize their behavior by declaring &quot;All are sinners&quot;
&#8212; which they conveniently interpret to mean that they are entitled to lecture you about religious matters.)

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank">uses
this technique</a> in many ways. For instance:
<p>
<ul>

<p><li>
First, Bill Wilson tried to get prospective recruits to sign blank checks, and
promise to go to &quot;any length&quot; to quit drinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Wait for the end of the spree, or at least for a
lucid interval. Then let his family or a friend ask him if he
wants to quit for good and if he would go to any extreme to do
so. If he says yes, then his attention should be drawn to you as
a person who has recovered.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
What if he says
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;No, I won't go to <i>any extreme</i>.
There are all kinds of things that I won't do to get sober, including
lie, cheat, steal, and rape little girls when the Moon gets full.
I won't join a crazy cult religion, either.&quot;?
</font>
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to any
lengths to get it &#8212; then you are ready to take certain steps.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>
Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, William G. Wilson, &quot;How It Works&quot;, 3rd &amp; 4th Edition, page 58.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But then, some pages later, Bill Wilson suddenly assumed a big fact not in evidence:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Remember it was agreed at the beginning <i>we would go to any lengths for victory over alcohol.</i><br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>
Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, William G. Wilson, &quot;Into Action&quot;, 3rd &amp; 4th Edition, page 76.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nowhere does it say that all of the alcoholics agreed in the beginning
to go to &quot;any length&quot; to quit drinking.
Bill Wilson just asked a question in one place, and then, in another place,
he assumed the answer that he wanted.

<li>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When they choose a sponsor, beginners should usually choose
someone with four to eight years of <i>Time</i>. Someone with less
time may not be experienced enough, while someone with much more
time may be too spiritual to relate well to a beginner's problems.&quot;
</font>
<p>
If you want to argue with that statement, the usual human thing to
do is to start arguing about how many years the ideal sponsor will
have, rather than whether one should get a sponsor at all, or whether
having many years of <i>Time</i> makes someone more spiritual.
<p>
That &quot;advice&quot; has many underlying assumptions &#8212; premises &#8212;
none of which are supported by any evidence (and none of which are even true):
<ul>
<li> Beginners should get sponsors.
<li> Beginners will benefit from having sponsors.
<li> Suitable sponsors will be able to relate to the beginners' problems
and help them with those problems.
<li> People grow increasingly spiritual from more years of practicing
the Twelve Steps and going to A.A. meetings.
<li> People with lots of <i>Time</i> are so spiritual and holy that
they have moved up to another plane of existence, one that is
just too lofty for a beginner to handle, and one from which the
terribly holy old-timers may have difficulties relating to the
common rabble.
</ul>
<p>
None of those assertions have been proven or even clearly stated and supported
by evidence and facts.
The speaker just shoves it all at us, &quot;under the table&quot;,
so to speak, as assumed facts that are just incidental to the
question of how many years of sobriety a good sponsor should have.
<p>
<font color="blue">
In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" target="_blank">
recent research has shown</a> that newcomers do not benefit
at all from getting sponsors. In a recent controlled study, a
group of new Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous
members who got sponsors did no
better than another group who didn't get sponsors.
But strangely
enough, the elder members <i>who chose to become sponsors</i>
did better than the other members who did not choose to
act as sponsors. (The sponsors were a self-selecting group; not randomly
chosen.)
It seems that getting their egos stroked, acting as puffed-up,
all-wise, all-knowing sponsors, ordering the wimpy newcomers around,
helps the sponsors to stay clean and sober, even if it doesn't help
the newcomers any.<br>

Traditionally, the sponsor is supposed to say that he isn't
doing it for the newcomer; that he's doing it for his own sobriety.
The <i>Big Book</i> actually instructs recruiters to tell new prospects:
<P>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Outline the program of action, explaining how you made a self-appraisal,
how you straightened out your past and why you are now endeavoring
to be helpful to him. It is important for him to realize that your attempt
to pass this on to him plays a vital part in your recovery. Actually,
he may be helping you more than you are helping him.<br>

were not doing it for the benefit of the newcomers, and that the
newcomers would not benefit from the sponsors' &quot;help&quot;?

<li>
In his second book, Bill Wilson wrote about confessing all of one's sins (Step Five)
by saying:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The real tests of the situation are your own willingness to confide and your
full confidence in the one with whom you share your first accurate self-survey.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 61.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>First accurate self-survey</i>? Says who?
Bill Wilson was assuming a lot in declaring that
newcomers to A.A. had <i>never</i> done an accurate self-assessment before.
How would he know?
But then, Bill always assumed that alcoholics were just
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">immoral bums</a> who needed to be
reformed with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">his version of spirituality</a>.
Bill Wilson assumed that all A.A. newcomers were strangers to real religion, people without any real
morals or spirituality &#8212; they were even atheists or agnostics &#8212; who
knew nothing about God and who had never done any introspection before.
Bill also wrongly assumed that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_induce_guilt" target="_blank">wallowing in guilt and only
listing negative things</a> &#8212;
all of one's &quot;defects of character&quot;,
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, and &quot;wrongs&quot; &#8212; constituted
&quot;an accurate self-survey&quot;.
</ul>

<p><br>
<a name="hidden_assumptions"> </a>
<li> <b>Hidden Assumptions</b><br>
Hidden assumptions are much like the previous two kinds of assumptions,
<a href="#assume">Assume The Major Premise</a>, and
<a href="#petitio_principii">Assume Facts Not In Evidence (<i>Petitio Principii</i>)</a>,
but in this technique the assumption is so subtle that it isn't even mentioned.
<p>
Television infomercials that sell stock market trading computer programs,
or options or FOREX trading programs, all try to foist numerous hidden
assumptions on the viewers:
<p>
<ul>
<li> They assume that stocks, contracts, or other pieces of paper will
routinely go up and down in price in neat cycles, and that you will be
able to choose a stock, option, or futures contract that will conveniently
do so for you.

<p><li> They assume that you or their computer program will be able to
pick the correct stock or option and buy it at the lowest price, and
then sell it at the highest price. In other words, they assume that you
or their program will be able to &quot;time the market&quot;.

<p><li> They assume that there is something called a &quot;cash flow&quot;
that you can just dip into, as if it were a river of money, and you can
just scoop out buckets for yourself.
There is no such thing in the financial markets. The reality is that there
are a lot of sharp, experienced, professional traders
who are buying and selling pieces of paper while haggling over every penny.

<p><li> They often tell you that you can place stop losses on every order.
That is true, but you still lose money before the stop loss takes effect.
<i>It stops the loss from getting even worse; it doesn't stop you from losing money.</i>
And stop loss orders don't always take effect as soon as you wish. In
big stock market crashes (like 1929 and 1987), people had to wait a long time, a seeming
eternity, while they watched their stock sink like the Titanic, before
their sell order was finally filled by a willing buyer &#8212; filled at a very low price.
(Often, there just aren't a lot of willing buyers around in a stock market crash.
Everybody is trying to sell.
And you can't sell something until someone else wants to buy it from you.)
That infomercial implies that you will only lose a little bit on bad trades
because of stop loss orders, while making big profits on lucky trades.
(<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Stop your loses; let your winnings run.&quot;</i></font>)
But that isn't necessarily true or always even possible.
And they assume that if you lose a little on one trade, that you will
make it up on the next trade.
That isn't necessarily true, either. If your luck is bad, you can stumble
from one losing trade to another until you run out of money.

<p><li> The infomercial makers assume or imply that the computer program
is looking at the same things as the market.
It isn't. Computer programs track current trends in prices &#8212; in other words,
by analyzing the past, up to just a few seconds ago &#8212; but the big
institutional investors and traders
are always buying and selling things based on <i>their vision of the future</i>,
as determined by such arcane factors as the prime interest
rate, what the Fed is rumored to be thinking,
 the price of oil, housing starts, unemployment figures, retail sales, and various other
economic measurements
like business profit predictions and the Consumer Confidence Index, and even rumors and
whispered tips and insider trading information.
The big boys are always looking at the future and trading on the basis of what is going
to happen in the future, while the computer program
in your dinky little computer is reacting to the present and past prices.
On top of that, the big traders have networks of bribed informants and industrial spies
gathering insider information for them, and you don't.

<p><li> The infomercial makers assume or imply that their computer program
can predict the future. Oh really? If it can, why isn't everybody using it?

<p><li> They assume that your trades won't ever influence the market &#8212;
that your buy and sell orders won't drive prices up or down, no matter
how large your orders are. They even assume that <i>ALL</i> of the buy
and sell orders of all of the other people who also bought the same
computer program won't drive the prices up or down, and that you won't
end up in a race with them to see who can get their orders executed first.
The infomercials don't mention the fact that if the computer program
tells every program user to buy the same stock or option at the same time,
the price of the stock or option will jump sharply, and then it
won't be a bargain any more.

<p><li> The talking heads in infomercials assume that leverage is good,
and that you will profit from it.
They happily declare that you can buy stocks, options, and futures contracts
on margin &#8212; meaning, putting up, in cash, only a small fraction of their actual cost,
and borrow the rest.
That allows you to profit by several times as much money if your gamble
pays off big. But it also allows you to lose several times as much money if the trade goes
sour. In highly-leveraged deals, you can easily lose more than your total investment,
and end up owing the broker large sums of money. (Remember Long Term Capital Management.)
The salesmen don't mention that ugly fact.

<p><li>
The infomercials assume that you can win at the financial markets trading
game, even if you are a beginner, just because you bought an easy-to-use
computer program.
Those TV commercials imply that the big boys in the financial markets
are too stupid to buy the same computer program and use it (if only to
see what the dumb thing says), and that the big boys are too stupid to hire
lots of smart young computer programmers to write even better programs for them
(which they have already done).

<p><li>
The infomercials assume that it is easy to be right.<br>
Many billions of dollars worth of stocks, bonds, options, and futures
contracts are bought and sold every day, and every trade is between two
people or companies, one of whom buys and one of whom sells.<br>
Curiously, both parties in every trade believe that what they are doing
is the best thing to do.<br>
Every time you buy, the guy who is selling is convinced that you are
making a mistake.<br>
Every time you sell, the buyer is convinced that you are making a mistake.<br>
If you are a beginner who is trading against experienced professionals at big
market-making brokerages, who is more likely to be right?
</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="assume_futures"> </a>
<li> <b>Assume Futures or Future Results</b><br>
Stack the deck in an argument by assuming that certain future events or future results will occur.

<p>
For example, a political candidate can be dismissed with this argument:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Sure, Joe Blow is a great guy and he has some good issues and he says some
good stuff. But he can't win, so there is no point in seriously considering him
as a candidate.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Obviously, if nobody will seriously consider Joe as a candidate, he can't win.
<p>
(And now, in 2009, do you remember how many people said that the young,
black, Junior Senator from Illinois couldn't possibly really win the
Presidency, so his campaign was just a joke, and shouldn't be taken
seriously?)


<p><br>
<a name="fallacy_of_presupposition"> </a>
<li> <b>Fallacy of Presupposition</b><br>
Ask for an explanation of something not yet established:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;If evolution is true,
then...&quot;</i></font><br>

Since the study of evolution is a work in progress, one can always find
a point of controversy, and challenge the other person to demonstrate
that it is true, while assuming that failure to do so proves the entire
matter false.

<p><br>
<a name="affirmation_of_the_consequent"> </a>
<li> <b>Affirmation of the Consequent</b><br>
Improperly validate the key element of an implication:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;The Bible says God's people will
be happy; we are happy; therefore the Bible speaks truthfully.&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
A.A. does it like this:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.
To thoroughly follow our path requires absolute abstinence from drinking
alcohol. If somebody drinks, then he isn't thoroughly following our path.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;But this one guy didn't drink, so he did thoroughly follow our path,
and he stayed sober,
so that proves that the program works to keep people from drinking.&quot;
</font>

<p><br>
<a name="ftnt09_ret"> </a>
<a name="irrelevant_conclusion"> </a>
<li> <b>Irrelevant Conclusion (<i>Ignoratio Elenchi</i>)</b><br>
It's a conclusion that does not follow from the argument:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Jehovah's Witnesses have the true religion
because only we do so much door-to-door preaching.&quot;</i></font><br>
If you point out that Mormons also preach in this way, you'll be told
that they don't do as much of it, or that their religion is
<b><i>obviously</i></b>
false.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt09">9</a></sup></font>

<p>
Likewise,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Alcoholism is bad, really bad, so A.A.,
which is intended to save alcoholics, is good.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
That is bad logic. There is no evidence that the A.A. cult religion actually saves anyone.
And <i>intending to save people</i> doesn't make something good.
They have to actually do it &#8212; really save people.
Just &quot;intending&quot; isn't good enough.
You know the old saying, &quot;The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.&quot;

<p>
That bogus logic is no different than,<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Drug addiction is bad, really bad, so Scientology is good.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
(Scientology has a front group called &quot;Narconon&quot; that claims
to save drug addicts by using Scientology &quot;principles&quot; on them.)
<p>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Cancer is bad, really bad, so the Nazi Party is good.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
(The Nazis really did want to wipe out cancer. See
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Proctor2" target="_blank">
<i>The Nazi War on Cancer</i></a> by Robert N. Proctor.)
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A.A. missionaries like to brag about the scientific studies that have found that there is
a genetic factor in alcoholism. They then claim that those studies support the
A.A. disease theory of alcoholism. That is another <i>irrelevant conclusion</i>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The fact that some genes affect a person's susceptibility to alcohol addiction does
not make alcoholism a disease any more than my genes for blue-green eyes prove that
Blue-Eye-ism is a disease. And I also have the genes for premature graying of the hair,
and that isn't a disease either.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Just because someone is more prone to alcohol addiction does not make him powerless
over alcohol or unable to control his actions, and it does not make habitual
alcohol consumption a disease.


<p><br>
<a name="confusion_of_beliefs"> </a>
<li> <b>Confusion of Beliefs with Facts</b><br>
This includes
<ul>
<li> <i>Substitution of Beliefs for Facts</i>,
<li> <i>Insistance that &quot;Beliefs Trump Facts&quot;</i>,
 as if <i>&quot;It's what I believe&quot;</i> is
the final answer to an argument,
<li> and <i>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_belief_truth" target="_blank">Belief Equals Truth</a>&quot;</i>,
 as if something is true because somebody believes it.
</ul>
<p>
Dogmatic religious sects with bizarre beliefs are notorious for using
this logical fallacy. When you present a true believer member of such
a church with facts that contradict his beliefs, he answers,
&quot;Well, what we believe is...&quot;, and that is supposed to
be the end of the argument &#8212; the final answer on the subject.
The fact that they believe something supposedly makes contradictory
facts irrelevant and invalid &#8212; contradictory facts are just minor
irritants to be ignored and discarded.


<p>
An aspirin commercial portrayed a man declaring,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Last year I had a heart attack, right there where
she is standing. If it hadn't been for Bayer aspirin, who knows?
I believe that Bayer aspirin saved my life.&quot;<br>
</font>
No actual medical evidence is supplied to show that aspirin really saved him
from death by heart attack, and the commercial doesn't actually say that
Bayer aspirin saved the guy's life.
In fact, the commerical does not even say that the man took any aspirin.
We just get his uninformed &quot;belief&quot;.
Besides, is that guy for real, or is he just a paid actor reading a script?
<br>
Note that this is also an example of
<a href="#suggestions"><i>Sly Suggestions</i></a> and
<a href="#anecdote"><i>Proof By Anecdote</i></a>.

<p>
A woman who was campaigning for John McCain in Florida declared,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You've got to understand
how bad it will be if we get Obama, and I firmly believe that.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
NPR (National Public Radio), Morning News, 3 November 2008.

<br>
That woman's firm belief is not evidence of anything &#8212; other than evidence of
what her strongly-held opinions happen to be.


<p>
When a person who is skeptical of Alcoholics Anonymous declares,
<font color="blue">
&quot;The Bible does not say that God will make you quit drinking
and restore you to sanity and take care of your will and your life for you and remove
all of your defects of character just because you 'turned your life over' and confessed
all of your sins to your sponsor,&quot;</font> 
a 12-Step believer answers,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;What, don't you believe that God cares about you and
wants you to be healthy and happy?&quot;
</font>

<p>
The answer is,
<font color="blue">
&quot;It doesn't matter what I believe about God's feelings and desires,
the fact remains that the Bible still does not say that God will do the 12 Steps for you.
And God must 'work the Steps' for you, and give you miracles on demand,
and restore you to sanity, and make you quit drinking,
and talk to you in a s&eacute;ance,
or else the Steps won't work.&quot;
</font>

<p>
(In fact, the Bible actually
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="_blank">specifically bans several
of the practices</a> that are embodied in the 12 Steps, like demanding miracles, and
dabbling in the occult with s&eacute;ances and hearing voices, and
assuming that you can make God do what you wish if you confess enough.)

There, the writer uses both

&quot;I'm sure that President Bush had the legal authority to spy on
thousands of Americans and tap their phones without a warrant.&quot;</font><br>

The &quot;good heart&quot; argument is one that George W. Bush uses often.

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He has a good heart.&quot;

<a name="confusion_of_abstractions"> </a>
<li> <b>Confusion of Abstractions with Reality</b><br>
This includes <i>Confusing the Map with the Territory</i>. (The territory is the real land; the map is an
abstraction drawn on a piece of paper.)
<p>
We humans are very good at making abstractions to reduce big complex things to small manageable simple ideas.
Unfortunately, we are prone to making the error of confusing our abstractions with the actual thing
that they represent. Then,
<ul>
<p>
<li>
&quot;Fighting for the Flag&quot; equals defending one's country from an enemy. (They are not the same
thing at all.) Likewise, burning a flag is not burning down America.

<p><li>
An ardent young Nazi wrote a letter to his girlfriend, explaining that he did not
wish to die in the coming war (WWII), but if he did, it didn't matter, because
&quot;What is my death compared to the Greatness of Destiny?&quot;  Obviously, with 20-20 hindsight we can see
that Adolf Hitler offered no &quot;Greatness of Destiny&quot; that was worth dying for.
(It is an immense human tragedy that for thousands of years, young people have been conned into fighting
and dying for such meaningless grandiose language.)

<p>
<li>
A funny colored area on a paper map (an abstraction) is suddenly worth fighting
for, even if &quot;we&quot; do not own it (like Vietnam and Iraq).

<p>
<li>
In a stock market television program, a pundit declared that the current condition of the stock market was,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Liquidity seeking things of value.&quot;<br>
</font>
<i>&quot;Liquidity&quot;</i> is an abstraction, a relative measure of how much
money is easily available for loans or purchases of stocks and bonds. <i>Liquidity</i>
is not a hairy animal like a bear or a bull that prowls Wall Street seeking something to eat.
<p>
Now there may have been a few people or institutional investors who were seeking something of value to buy &#8212; 
there are usually at least a few bargain-hunters around &#8212; but &quot;Liquidity&quot; was definitely not
roaming &quot;The Street&quot;, searching for something to buy.
 In fact, the sub-prime mortgage deb&aacute;cle soon shattered
the confidence of &quot;The Market&quot;, and left it very illiquid. (In other words, those people who
had some money decided that they would rather keep it than give it to some fast-talking con-artists.)

dress her in Israelite clothes, and give her a month
to mourn for her dead husband or father (whom you killed). Then you
can drag her into your bed and keep her as your sex slave
for as long as you wish (they call it, &quot;marry her&quot;).
If you grow tired of her, you can get rid of her at any time
you wish (they call it &quot;divorce her&quot;).
But if you have had sex with her &#8212; &quot;if you have slept
with her as your wife&quot; &#8212; then you have destroyed
her cash value &#8212; you have &quot;dishonored her&quot;,
and you cannot sell her into slavery any more. You will have to give
her her freedom &#8212; just boot her out into the streets when you
are done with her.

Who are you to claim that you know more than Professor Bore?&quot;

<li>
A radio advertisement for vitamins says, &quot;Dr. Sawbones, a recognized authority on blah-blah...&quot;

I want to conclude with a word about &quot;You gotta believe it 'cause it's in the Bible.&quot;
You can bet your bottom dollar that the person saying it is not referring to the Sermon
on the Mount. Rather he has in mind a passage you have no business believing in &#8212; one,
for instance, supporting homophobia or gender inequality.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No one says, &quot;You gotta believe it 'cause it's in Shakespeare&quot; or Dante or Goethe or Pushkin.
Although not as much as the Bible, these writings still have a lot of authority for a lot
of people. The difference is they have no <i>doctrine</i> of authority.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Why, for Christians, should the Bible alone have a doctrine of authority, especially when such
doctrines demand either a literalist approach which is unacceptable or something which waffles
hopelessly?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Why does the Bible need a doctrine of authority? To compel our allegiance? To make us
believe something our reason, experience and conscience reject?
How can anything outwardly command us that has not first inwardly claimed us? Besides,
nobody thinks all biblical passages are of equal worth, that each represents an
axis on which our whole faith pivots.<br>

A variation on the <i>Appeal To Authorities</i> trick is a bogus appeal to
authorities &#8212; city phony or questionable or non-existent authorities.
For example, a sensational TV show about UFOs described an unknown object as,
&quot;...but many experts considered it a UFO.&quot;
Excuse me? What &quot;experts&quot;? They were never named.
And how does someone become an expert on UFOs? Can you get
a Ph.D. in Ufology? Will the U.S. Air Force or NASA or the CIA or NSA
certify you as an expert on UFOs?
For the purposes of that TV show, it seemed that an expert was anyone that
they wished to call an expert.

<p>
Another kind of appeal to authorities is <i>Name Dropping</i>, where the speaker
liberally salts and peppers his speech with the names of the famous, rich or powerful
people, as if movie stars and millionaires have all of the wisdom of the world.

<p>
In A.A. history, Dr. Frank Buchman was of course the champion name dropper.
He spent his whole life
<a href="orange-rroot180.html" target="_blank">in pursuit of the rich and famous</a>, and dropped
their names all over the place.

<p>
In A.A., the rap is:
<ul>
<li> &quot;Well, Bill Wilson wrote in his second book that if you don't do the
Twelve Steps, you are
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_warrant" target="_blank">signing your own death warrant</a>,
so you had better do all of the Steps all of the time if you want to live.

<li> &quot;Joe Blow has twenty years of sobriety, so when he says
that six times seven is 48, you'd better believe he's speaking from
a wealth of experience.&quot;

<li> &quot;Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that alcoholism is a spiritual
disease, so it's a proven fact.

<li> &quot;Dr. William D. Silkworth&quot; said that alcoholism is a disease coupled
with an allergy, so there is no question about it.&quot;

<li> &quot;Professor George E. Vaillant of Harvard University says that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">all alcoholics
should join A.A., even though it doesn't work</a>, so they should, of course, for
their own spiritual well-being.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
A variation on <i>Appeal to Authorities</i> is to get a fake expert to say what you want people to hear.
Use some bozo who got his Ph.D. from a diploma mill, and call him the greatest expert on the
subject in the country, and have him spout your party line.
That's what the current anti-abortion movement is doing with their
pseudo-scientific claims that abortions harm women's health and drive them to suicide.
Their &quot;expert&quot;, the &quot;greatest authority on the subject&quot;, got his degree from a
&quot;non-accredited institution&quot;, and his &quot;research&quot; is
little more than a collection of anecdotes.
(See Bill Moyers, PBS, 20 June 2007.)
<p>
Another variation on the <i>Appeal to Authorities</i> technique is to
use the passive voice to award bogus honors to bogus authorities, as in, &quot;Mr. Ima Bore has
been recognized as the greatest authority on Chinese vitamins.&quot; Has been recognized by
whom? (Half a dozen ignorant sycophants?)
<p>
Another variation on the <i>Appeal to Authorities</i> technique is to falsely quote things that were never said or written,
as in
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Professor Bore declared in his encyclopedic <i>History of Western Thinkers</i>
that unthinking obedience to the Powers That Be was the easiest path to happiness&quot;</font>,
when Prof. Bore never said any such thing.
<p>
Bill Wilson used this stunt when he declared that William James wrote in his
<i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>
that spiritual experiences came from &quot;<a href="orange-letters41.html#compression" target="_blank">compression at depth</a>&quot;.  James never said anything like that.
(Bill Wilson was just
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">
 stoned out of his gourd</a> when he read the <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>.)
<p>
Bill Wilson also declared that the famous psychiatrist Carl Jung said that the only
cure for alcohol addiction (dipsomania) was religiomania &#8212; religious fanaticism.
<a href="orange-Jung.html" target="_blank">Jung never said any such thing either</a>.

<a name="credentials"> </a>
<li> <b>Cite Credentials</b><br>
This trick uses real credentials, titles, ranks, certificates, diplomas, or positions to
create the appearance that someone is an authority of some kind, and is right.
<p>
&quot;Professor Ima Bore has 17 degrees from the Philadelphia Institute of Phrenology, including
a Masters in Egg-Juggling.&quot;
<p>
Degrees and credentials are all well and good, but do not necessarily make someone right.
Our history is full of disasters brought on by people with degrees. Degrees are not wisdom.
Most of the people in government have some kind of credentials, and they still make horrible
mistakes and get us into unnecessary wars and economic crises.

This trick uses false or faked credentials, titles, ranks, certificates, diplomas, or positions to
create the appearance that someone is an authority of some kind when he is not.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The use of fake diplomas from a diploma mill immediately comes to mind. Then the charlaton assumes the
title of &quot;Doctor&quot;, and pretends to be a recognized authority on some subject.

<p><li> Speaking of &quot;getting recognized&quot;, that leads to setting up
phony &quot;councils&quot; or &quot;committees&quot; or other organizations to
issue fake credentials. For example,
<a href="orange-gulags.html#accreditation" target="_blank">a child-abusing fake teen rehabilitation center,
the &quot;Pacific Coast Academy&quot; in American Samoa</a>,
is not licensed or registered in the United States.
The academy's only accreditation, the academy's owners say, is with the &quot;Samoan Youth Rehabilitation Agency&quot;.
But the &quot;Youth Rehabilitation Administration Agency of Western Samoa&quot;
is a fake organization that the child-abusers set up to give themselves credentials.
That fake agency basically does not exist, and it is not even listed in the telephone directory.

<a name="appeal2force"> </a>
<li> <b>Appeal to Force (<i>Argumentum ad Baculum</i>)</b><br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;You must have faith. It's very important that you believe. Little Susie didn't believe in Santa Claus,
so God got mad at Susie and turned Susie's father into an alcoholic who got drunk and beat her.

Likewise, A.A. supporters claim that Alcoholics Anonymous has more than
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">2 million members in more than 153 countries
world-wide</a>, and they say that more than 13 million copies of the <i>Big Book</i>
have been printed, and then they say that those numbers prove
that A.A. is a really good organization, and that all of Bill Wilson's
religious beliefs must be true and correct, and that the Twelve-Step
program must really work great.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Such an illogical argument ignores the fact that Hitler had far more
than 2 million Nazis, and Stalin had far more than 2 million Communists,
but those weren't good organizations, out to save the world.
They also sold lots of copies of their books, <i>Mein Kampf</i>
and <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, but neither Communism nor Nazism was a good
philosophy for the betterment of the world,
in spite of their many fanatical true believers.
And neither of their systems worked, either, in spite of their large numbers of
members.
<p>
Likewise, Scientology and the Moonies also have large numbers of members,
and they also sell lots and lots of books, but that doesn't make them
good cult religions, either.
<p>
The large numbers proved nothing except that it is possible to hoodwink a lot
of people.

And A.A. is a complete failure as a treatment program for alcoholism. It has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">a very

For example, when I complain that a certain computer program or feature

run Linux, so he doesn't need to bother making his product work right
with Linux.
<p>
Likewise, when I ask for other things to work correctly, and have all

Try to make people believe that something is good because it came from

in the Cave of the Ancients in the Himalayan Mountains by celibate monks
for ages, but now we have the secret.
<p>
For example:

<p>

The saying, &quot;It's our culture,&quot; is often synonymous with, &quot;Yes, we are doing stupid things.
we do stupid things because we have always done stupid things.&quot;
Even the Nazis noticed that logical fallacy:
&quot;When I hear people speak of culture, I reach for my pistol.&quot;  &#8212;  Heinrich Himmler.
<p>
Treatment centers that use 12-Step quackery on alcoholics and drug addicts
like to call 12-Step-based treatment &quot;traditional treatment&quot;,
even though Alcoholics Anonymous is really only 70 years old, which
makes it far from traditional. Burning girls at the stake for witchcraft, and
putting the town drunkard in stocks and pillory, now that's traditional treatment.

<p>
A close relative to the argument that
&quot;It's Traditional&quot; is the declaration that

The speaker gives no good reason for his behavior; he just says that &quot;We do it this way
because we do it this way.&quot;

National Public Radio recently (2013.05.15) came up with a good example of this:

When the owner of the business was asked about the price, he rationalized, &quot;I don't understand
what the big deal is. It's normal.&quot;
Of course the local Italians declared that there was nothing normal about paying $21 for an
ice cream cone, and they would never do it.

George W. Bush uses this technique often, in claiming that he is not &quot;an elitist&quot;
and not &quot;one of the elite&quot;
(in spite of the fact that he was born into a very rich family, attended Yale
University, and joined <i>Skull And Bones</i>, one of the most elite,
exclusive and powerful fraternities in the world), and was molly-coddled and protected
all of the way to the White House.

<i>&quot;There ain't nobody here but us stupid common folks. I'm just

and clever arguments, and they try to make us feel like fools

Acting President George W. Bush was born an instant millionaire <!------ in Connecticut --->

<li> <b>Antirationalism</b><br>

<!-- a href="#antirationalism2" -->
Antirationalism<!-- /a --> is another propaganda trick
that is similar to anti-intellectualism, but it's different in an important way.
Antirationalism promotes the idea that there are no such
things as valid, reliable facts or hard evidence, just various
conflicting opinions.
Speakers who are pushing antirationalism argue that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just my opinion versus your opinion, and it's all so
controversial that we can't really know anything for sure.&quot;
</font>

<p>
A variation on this technique is the old line,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh heck, you can never really know for sure what caused it...
Maybe it was this, or maybe it was that...&quot;</font>,<br>
or<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Who knows? Maybe it's true. You can never know anything absolutely for sure.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
That is just a dodge to avoid admitting the truth. Yes, we can know some
things for sure:
<ul>
<li> The earth is round, not flat.
<li> The Moon is not made of green cheese.
<li> Bacteria, not evil spirits, cause strep throat and tuberculosis.
<li> Sour milk is not caused by witches casting nasty spells.
<li> Penicillin works better than faith healing for curing streptococcal infections.
<li> Alcoholism is not a
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">spiritual disease</a>&quot;

&quot;Higher Power&quot;</a>
(or not even cured, but just postponed).

Life isn't all just a vague mystery where maybe one thing is true, or
maybe a different thing is true, and everybody has their own opinion,
and nobody knows anything for sure.

&quot;It's all just an image. It's all just an illusion. We don't actually see reality.
You never really know anything for sure.&quot;
</font>

<p>
For example, a scheming defense lawyer might tell a witness to a murder,
&quot;Isn't it true that we don't actually
see reality? In fact, our two eyes don't even see the same image.
 Light plays on our retinas, causing electrical impulses to flow through the optic nerves
into the brain, where the impulses are amplified, inverted, filtered,
disassembled, reassembled, and formed into what we
interpret as three-dimensional images of something.
But what we think we see bears little resemblance to what actually happened in front of
our eyes, out there in the objective world.
In fact, it's all nothing but a play of vibrating atoms.
Even interpreting those atoms as being divided into separate, individual,
 objects is an illusion.
In truth, it's all just a single unified Universe of vibrating atoms.
So you didn't really see my client murder someone, did you? You only thought you saw it.
You experienced an illusion.&quot;

<p>
The obvious answer to that is, &quot;Since it's all just an illusion, you shouldn't have any objection
to the jury finding your client guilty, and the state executing him for murder. He isn't really
being executed. It's all just an illusion. You only think you are watching him get executed.&quot;

And the most successful program of all is people
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">simply quitting

<a name="Heiden"> </a>
Konrad Heiden explained how Adolf Hitler used this technique:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sometimes Hitler could not decide whether to heap the blame for everything on France or on the Jews.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font face="Times,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
[Then Heiden gave examples of Hitler giving speeches where he contradicted himself.]
</font>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus the prophet falsifies his own words. With the deepest conviction he contradicts
his deepest convictions.
It is as though the various heads of a many-headed beast were biting one another.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The truth is irremediably buried beneath these deceptions and contradictions.
How, then, can the speaker expect to put through a single incisive,
suitable lie, when from speech to speech, from sentence to sentence, he changes even
the lies?
Whom does he expect to persuade that he himself believes a single one of these
mutually contradictory lies?
And to what purpose does he try to spread an opinion among the people, when on the
very next day he is going to sacrifice that opinion?<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such questions are asked by those who do not understand propaganda, who regard
propaganda as the art of instilling an opinion in the masses. Actually it is the
art of receiving an opinion from the masses.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The usual conception of the great propagandist is the commanding, purposive mind,
who by magic suggestion subjects an empty animal mass to his will; Marc Anthony,
who in a single speech makes a thousand friends out of a thousand enemies.
It is in this light that most of our contemporaries view the greatest propagandist
of our day, Adolf Hitler, and this is Adolf Hitler's own idea of himself.
With the authority of success, he has put over a false theory of the world; the theory
that he dominates the minds of millions by tirelessly hammering the same simple
statement into them. But this only shows that he never listened to himself very
closely, and was never too eager to illuminate his own success.  He does not
hammer the same simple statement into the minds of millions; on the contrary,
he played with the masses and titillated them with the most contradictory
assertions. It is this art of contradiction which makes him the greatest and
most successful propagandist of his time. He does not dominate the minds of millions,
his mind belongs to them. Like a piece of wood floating on the waves, he follows
the shifting currents of public opinion. This is his true strength.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The true aim of political propaganda is not to influence, but to study, the masses.
The speaker is in constant communication with the masses; he hears an echo,
and senses the inner vibration. In forever setting new and contradictory assertions
before his audience, Hitler is tapping the outwardly shapeless substance of public
opinion with instruments of varying metals and varying weights. When a resonance
issues from the depths of the substance, the masses have given him the pitch;
he knows in what terms he must finally address them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Rather than a means of directing the mass mind, propaganda is a technique for riding
with the masses. It is not a machine to make wind, but a sail to catch the wind.
The mass, however, is a phenomenon of deepest world importance &#8212; this leveled
conglomeration of fools and wise men, heroes and cowards, proud and humble,
the unusual and the average. This mass, with its anonymous intellectual pressure,
its unexpected moods and unconscious desires, mirrors and echoes the commanding
force of prevailing conditions; it embodies and personifies the necessities
and resistances of the objective world; it expresses the silent command of Fate
in a mysterious murmur. It is the art of the great propagandist to detect this
murmur and translate it into intelligible utterance and convincing action.
If he can do this, his utterances and actions may be full of contradictions &#8212;
because the contradictions lie in the things themselves; they may
be deceptive and misleading. The lies of the propagandist reveal
the deeper truth of the whole world's cynicism and dishonesty. By his lies
the great propagandist involuntarily shows himself to be an honest, self-revealing
prophet of the Devil.<br>

<a name="ought_2B_true"> </a>
<li> <b>It Ought To Be True, So It Is.</b><br>
This logical fallacy is a form of wishful thinking, where people are willing to believe
that things are true just because it seems like they <i>ought to be</i> true.
<p>
People routinely believe in a wide variety of screwy things just because they
like the sounds of them, and think that they ought to be true:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Higher beings who ride around in flying saucers are here to save us (from our
own stupidity).

<li> Ghosts of dead saints come and help some people, and save some children from
disasters (while letting many others die).

<li> Ghosts of dead pets come back and save their former owners from various accidents.

<li> The ghost of the Virgin Mary routinely goes around the world
making statues bleed, just to increase the faith of the wavering doubters.

<li> 
God has nothing better to do with his time than save alcoholics from themselves
by punishing them and &quot;beating them with the whip of alcoholism&quot;
and forcing them to join the 12-Step religion.

<!----------------------
<LI>
----------------------->

</ul>
<p>
Clever politicians and propagandists will exploit peoples' willingness to believe
such things by repeating such stories, which makes the gullible members of the public
think that the politician must be really good, and really spiritual.


<p><br>
<a name="too_terrible"> </a>
<li> <b><i>It's Too Terrible To Tell</i></b><br>

The essense of this technique is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We know a truth, but it is too terrible to tell, and to do so would
harm too many innocent people, so we can't say it, and you shouldn't say it either.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
This argument was used by the Church in Rome during the Middle Ages to
declare that you couldn't tell the truth about all of the crimes and
sins of the Church &#8212; burning millions of women and girls as witches,
molesting the alter boys, selling everything from indulgences to
Bishop's offices, and using the Grand Inquisition
and heresy trials to silence the critics &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;You can't criticize the Church, because if you do, it will
destroy the faith of the weak people, and then they won't be able to
get into Heaven.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
Politicians routinely use this technique, too.
They believe that we can't hear the truth about things like global warming
or peak oil, because if the people really knew the whole truth about what
is going on, the people would panic and society would fall apart.  The
powers that be think that the truth about those things is too terrible
to tell, so the politicians don't tell us the truth.
<p>
Contemporary politicians also use this trick to avoid telling the truth about what
the U.S. Government has been doing in a variety of areas: &quot;It's too terrible to tell, and
if it was publicly known, it would help the terrorists. So don't ask what we have been doing.&quot;

<p>

<li> <b>Argue from Adverse Consequences</b><br>

Put pressure on the decision maker by pointing out the dire

the <i>Slippery Slope</i> argument.
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;If we let Viet Nam go, then all of Southeast Asia will fall
to Communism like a row of dominoes going down. Then we won't be
able to stop Communism. We will lose the whole world.&quot;
<p>
<li> If we curb the power of corporations, we will destroy the American
business environment. We can't tell corporations that they don't have God-given
civil rights like freedom of speech and freedom to influence voters, or else all of
the corporations will flee to foreign countries that treat them better. (Countries
like China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvadore
&#8212; the countries to which they have <i>already</i> moved their factories.)

<p>
<li> Likewise, we can't enforce environmental protection laws against those same
corporations, or else they will move to foreign countries that have no such laws, and
that will be the end of America.

<p>
That is bad logic. The reason for believing in God is because one believes that there is such
an entity. What benefits someone might get from such a belief is a very different issue.

while the employees of Enron and the subsidiaries like <i>Pacific Gas
and Electric</i> (in Portland, Oregon) that Enron bought and sucked dry,
now have no retirement funds at all left.  Nothing. And many of those
retirees are just too old to go back to work. So what do they do?
Join the homeless people, I guess.
<p>
But those smiling, well-dressed, suit-and-tie, white-collar criminals weren't
&quot;violent&quot; when they stole Grandma and Grandpa's retirement funds.
<p>
And the U.S. government isn't going to replace their retirement funds is it?
&#8212; Not even the part that was given to the politicians, mostly Republicans,
in &quot;campaign contributions&quot;.
The Republicans are talking about spending the wealth of the nation on
a war with oil-rich Iraq, not on taking care of our own old people.
<p>
The Republicans were all for an extremely expensive bailout of the
savings and loan institutions, which happened after, and was caused by,
the Republicans deregulating banking,
but they won't do a thing for the retirees who got burned by Enron after
the Republicans deregulated the natural gas industry.

<li> I have <a href="orange-incons.html" target="_blank">many more</a>, far too many to put
on this page. <i>Inconsistency</i> just seems to be
<i>The Way of the American Politician</i>.
Benjamin Franklin once quipped that consistency was the hum-drum of
little minds. If that is so, then our politicians in Washington D.C.
must be world-class geniuses.

</ul>

<p>
A.A. dogma and literature are loaded
with inconsistencies and contradictions. For example,
<p>
<ul>
<li>
We learn from the <i>Big Book</i> that if someone
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#not_dry" target="_blank">abstains from
drinking for thirteen years</a> without going to A.A. or doing the
Twelve Steps, and then relapses, it proves that you can't do it
without A.A.. But if someone quits drinking for only six months by
going to meetings and doing the Twelve Steps, then that proves that
A.A. and the Twelve Steps work.<br>
(Even though the vast majority of Bill Wilson's new A.A. members
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
either did not quit drinking or soon relapsed</a>, and even though half of the authors
of the original <i>Big Book</i>
stories returned to drinking, Bill still insisted that his &quot;spiritual&quot;
program for sobriety worked great. And Bill Wilson considered all of the non-members
who didn't quit drinking as proof that you can't do it alone.)

<p>
<li> Likewise, according to A.A., if someone does the Twelve Steps
and quits drinking, then that proves that the Twelve Steps work for
making people quit drinking. But if someone does the Twelve Steps
and then relapses, it doesn't prove that the Twelve Steps
make people drink.

<p>
<li> If someone killed himself with alcohol, Bill Wilson considered him a failure
and a real loser. But if someone killed himself with tobacco, Bill Wilson considered
him &quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">a most effective member
of A.A.</a>&quot;, someone whose
&quot;more serious ailments were being rapidly cured&quot;.

<p>
<li> When someone comes to A.A. meetings and then quits drinking and stays quit,
A.A. gleefully claims the credit for the success.
But when someone comes to A.A. meetings and then drinks himself to death,
A.A. says that it isn't responsible for the failure.
<p>
<li> And <a href="orange-incons.html#AA_incons" target="_blank">I have plenty more</a>...

</ul>


<p>
<p><br>
<a name="apples_to_oranges"> </a>
<li> <b>Compare Apples To Oranges</b><br>
<p>
This is similar to the previous item, inconsistency, but has special
twists of its own.
<p>
In a radio commercial for a tax preparation service (Spring 2005), we heard:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Jackson-Hewitt's average refund is $400 more than the average IRS refund.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Well of course it is. They are comparing apples to oranges. The average refund from the IRS includes all
of the poorest people in the country. You have to actually make some money before you need a professional
tax accountant to prepare your tax forms for you, and can pay for it.
The average Jackson-Hewitt customer is lots richer than the average
minimum-wage janitor or burger-flipper, so of course they get larger refunds.
The commercial tries to imply that the larger refund is due to the Jackson-Hewitt accountants' skill in finding
deductions, but I suggest that it is due to their customer's higher incomes and higher withholdings, and hence,
larger refunds due.

Over in &quot;the recovery community&quot;, one A.A. defender announced:

I am appalled at such blatant misconstrual of the program of Alcoholics
Anonymous. AA is Spiritual, true, but not religious.
An edition of Webster's defines the two as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>  Religion - any system of faith or worship; the outward
manifestation of belief in a Supreme or Superior Being; love and obedience
toward God; piety; monastyic vow or state; conformity to Biblical precepts;
devotion; fidelity.<br>

<li>  Spiritual - incorporeal; not material; possessing the nature of
qualities of a spirit; mental or intellectual; pure; holy; heavenly-minded;
not lay or temporal; ecclesiastical; relating to matters of a sacred
nature; not worldly; the spiritual nature as oposed to physical.<br>
</ol>
<br>
Another edition of Websters (which leaves the Biblical concept out)
says:
<br>
<p>
<ol>
<li>  Religion - The worship of God or gods.  A belief; a system of
doctrines of faith and worship.<br>
<li> Spiritual - Not material; Relating to the moral feelings; Pure,
holy, sacred.<br>

<p>
But note that the writer was comparing a noun to an adjective. So of course
the noun &quot;religion&quot; sounds much more solid and material than
the adjective &quot;spiritual&quot;.
<p>
If we compare the adjective &quot;religious&quot; to the adjective
&quot;spiritual&quot;, some of the important distinctions vanish. In fact, the words become synonyms:

<a name="pleading"> </a>
<li> <b>Special Pleading</b><br>

Special pleading typically refers to the Will of God.
There are other &quot;special pleadings,&quot; like the Communist's
&quot;Force of History&quot; or a misguided environmentalist's
&quot;Mother Nature&quot;, but <i>God's Will</i> is still the most
popular excuse for doing some horrible things.
<p>
Don't do something because I tell you to do it, but rather, do it
because it is the Will of God, and God will be happy if you do it
for Him.
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Quit drinking&quot;,
<li> &quot;Do The Twelve Steps&quot;,
<li> &quot;Shove the Twelve Step religion on every sick person you can get&quot;,
<li> &quot;Blow Up The World Trade Center and kill thousands of innocent people&quot;,
<li> or &quot;Launch a <i>Blitzkrieg</i> <i>'Shock And Awe'</i>
bombing campaign on Bhagdad and kill thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians
with cluster bombs and the indiscriminate use of overwhelming
American firepower&quot;
</ul>
... Heck, everybody's just doing the Will of God.

An Israeli newspaper even quoted George W. Bush as saying that God told him to attack Afghanistan and Iraq...

<a name="selfsell"> </a>
<li> <b>Self-Sell</b><br>

This one is so simple and slick that it is brilliant: Instead of
trying to cram a particular attitude or belief down the throats of
some unwilling recipients, get them to convince themselves of the
validity of your ideas. Do something like ask them for their
help in promoting a good thing, so that they ask themselves,
<ul>
<li> &quot;How can we convince the general public of the virtues of
this program?&quot;
<li> &quot;How can we get people to support this worthwhile
cause?&quot;
</ul>
They will sell themselves on the idea as they try to sell it to
others.
<p>
<a name="cold_turkey"> </a>
For a humorous example of this, see the movie &quot;<i>Cold Turkey</i>&quot;
which starred Dick Van Dyke, who acted as a preacher who had to make
his whole town quit smoking. The local Neo-Nazis were a particularly
tough bunch to get to quit. Van Dyke won them over by enlisting them
as <b><i>smoking-ban enforcers</i></b>. Their only request: &quot;Can
we wear arm-bands?&quot;

<p>
<a name="actionizing"> </a>
Another twist on Self-Sell is that whenever a cult sends members
out recruiting, those recruiters will end up selling themselves on
the cult's dogma when they try to convince others of the truth of
the cult's teachings. Smart cult leaders know this, and get new
converts out recruiting, fast. It's called &quot;Actionizing.&quot;
A.A. calls it your &quot;Twelfth Step.&quot;

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> gives us a clear example of that in the
autobiographical story <i>The Vicious Cycle</i>. The author, James Burwell,
a former skeptic and unbeliever, described setting up a new A.A.
group in Philadelphia, after having been a member in New York City:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When I started to tell the boys how we did it in New York and
all about the spiritual part of the program, I found that they
would not believe me unless I was practicing what I preached.
Then I found that as I gave in to this spiritual or personality
change I was getting a little more serenity.
In telling newcomers how to change their lives and attitudes,
all of a sudden I found I was doing a little changing myself.<br>

It [propaganda] must repeat those points over and over again until the public
believes it. The principles behind propaganda are the same principles of mind
control, hypnotic suggestion, and mental programming: distraction and repetition.
With propaganda, distraction draws attention away from information that is true

information imbeds it in your subconscious mind so that your acceptance of its
truth becomes a conditioned response. You accept this information as true without

Alcoholics Anonymous has a standard list of unproven (and even <i>disproven</i>) assumptions
that they constantly repeat:

<li> A.A. is the best, the time-tested, <i>the proven way</i> to recover
from alcoholism.
<li> Keep Coming Back, It Works! (If you make it work...)
<li> Alcoholics need the Twelve Steps to teach them spirituality.
They didn't know anything about God before they met the Alcoholics Anonymous recruiter.
<li> The Twelve Steps are a great program for quitting drinking.
<li> Nobody can do it alone. You need your support group.
<li> Alcohol is cunning, baffling, and powerful, and wants to kill you.
<li> The Twelve Steps are &quot;simple spiritual principles&quot;
(rather than <a href="orange-rroot030.html#OG_practices">cult practices</a>).

This statement can be explained in several ways that do not

Using this technique, Republicans like to claim that Ronald Reagan somehow

<p>
Frank Buchman does not get the credit for every civil rights movement in the
world just because one of his followers showed up there and parrotted slogans.
And Mahatma Gandhi, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and President Harry Truman were not followers of Frank Buchman. The truth is that
the social-climbing Frank Buchman sought them out, and only talked to them for a few minutes.
Buchman only met Gandhi once, in 1915, and Adenauer perhaps a couple of times.
President Harry Truman declared that he had never talked to Frank Buchman.
Truman had sometimes helped Buchman's organization with draft problems, but
<a href="orange-rroot450.html#Truman_dropped" target="_blank">Truman dropped Buchman like a hot potato</a>
when he learned about Buchman's history and Nazi sympathies and draft dodging.
Nevertheless, Buchman forever after tried to imply that Mahatma Gandhi,
Konrad Adenauer, and Harry Truman were his followers, world leaders who had learned their &quot;spirituality&quot;
from Frank Buchman. (See Ghandi

Bill Wilson and A.A. use this technique constantly.
If anybody quit drinking after having attended

Wilson and A.A. were quick to claim or imply that the recovery was caused by A.A. and
the Twelve Steps. But when those people relapsed later, A.A. had nothing to do with that.
&quot;A.A. caused the sobriety, but it didn't cause the relapse.&quot;
Bill Wilson even took the credit for the sobriety of people
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Clinton_Street" target="_blank">who finally quit
drinking several years after</a> Bill encouraged them to quit.
<p>
Likewise, another A.A. promoter, Nan Robertson,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Robertson_already_quit" target="_blank">wrote in her book</a>,
<i>&quot;Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>, that
most of the newcomers to Alcoholics Anonymous had already quit drinking,

<a name="granfalloon"> </a>
<li> <b>Create A Granfalloon</b><br>

A granfalloon is some distinction or difference which sets members
of a group apart from other people who are not part of the group.
The purpose of creating a granfalloon is to engender a feeling of
&quot;Us versus Them.&quot;

<blockquote>

A granfalloon can be any distinguishing difference. Race, religion, and nationality

Sometimes a granfalloon can be a small, trivial difference, and still
work. When Hitler was still just a minor fledgeling politician,
just beginning to build up his Nazi party, he dressed his followers
in brown shirts. Some critics laughed and pointed out that they looked
ridiculous. But rather than discouraging Hitler's followers, the
criticism made them cling to their group and made them feel more
committed to Hitler. Hitler gained a loyal, hard-core cadre just for
the price of a few brown shirts.

<p>
In the book <i>Soul of A New Machine</i> by Tracy Kidder, the author
describes how a smart manager organized teams of young computer
geniuses, and set them to competing against each other in the
creation of a new computer. The hardware
designers were called &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, and the programmers
of the machine's internal software, the microcode, were called
&quot;The Micro-Kidders.&quot; The competition between them was so
intense that they worked day and night, seven days a week, to finish
the design and make the machine work. All of them argued that they
weren't going to let the other guys on their team down, and they
weren't going to let the other team outdo them. But the only real
difference between the two groups was which part of the design they
were working on. But that one tiny difference was enough to cement
their loyalty to their group.

<p>
Andrew Carnegie demonstrated the same cleverness in eliciting greater
output from one of his steel mills. He asked the foreman how many units of steel the day shift
had produced. Carnegie wrote the answer with chalk in large numbers on the sidewalk where the workers
entered the plant, and then simply walked away without explanation.
When the night crew came to work, they saw the number on the sidewalk, and asked
what it was. Someone told them.
The night crew beat that number by a little bit. Early in the morning,
Carnegie erased the day crew's number, and chalked in the night crew's output.
The day crew saw that number on the sidewalk when they came to work.
They worked even harder, and beat the
night crew's output. Carnegie chalked in that number.
The following night, the night crew beat the day crew again,
and Carnegie chalked in that number.
That contest of playing off the day crew against the night crew continued for weeks,
while output steadily rose. Carnegie never said a word about the workers having
to increase their productivity &#8212; he just played one group off against another,
using no distinction between the two groups except that one worked during the
day, and one worked at night.

<p>
In a beautiful demonstration of creating a granfalloon, teachers who
wanted to educate a class about racism created a new, artificial,
racial distinction: they separated the class into blue-eyed and
brown-eyed people, and declared that the brown-eyed people were
superior to the blue-eyed people. &quot;Everybody knows&quot; that
blue-eyed people are dishonest and lazy, and can't be trusted, and
lie a lot, while &quot;everybody knows&quot; that brown-eyed people
are hard-working, honest, and trustworthy... By the end of the day,
the two groups almost hated each other, even though it was just
a mild one-day demonstration of discrimination. (It's enough

A current television commercial for Prilosec&reg; uses a variation of
this trick: They ask,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;So which day are you on?&quot;</font>
and a bunch of people proudly hold up several fingers.
The commercial creates a feeling of being &quot;one of the club&quot;
among those people who take the medicine. The granfalloon is taking Prilosec.

<p>
Another TV commercial says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If there is a precise way to do things, SPDR (pronounced &quot;spider&quot;) ETF investors
will find it.&quot;<br>
</font>
That commercial implies that people who buy certain kinds of securities are a special class of
very smart investors, which is also
<a href="#stroking">a stroking ploy</a>.
But what evidence is there really that people who buy complex obscure derivatives and securities
in electronically-traded funds (ETF) are actually very smart?
Didn't all of Wall Street just melt down because of too many over-leveraged derivatives that were based on nothing
but other derivatives that were based on nothing but other worthless paper?
Aren't the brokers who sell such &quot;investments&quot; really the people who make the money?

<p> 
Alcoholics Anonymous obviously uses alcoholism as a granfalloon, to
separate their group from everybody else. Every member introduces
himself like, &quot;Hi, my name is Harry, and I'm an alcoholic.&quot;
Then outsiders, non-alcoholics, are called &quot;normal people&quot;,
&quot;regular people&quot;, &quot;normies&quot;, or &quot;earth
people&quot;, and <i>everybody knows</i> that you can't trust them
to be accepting or understanding...

<p>
Likewise, A.A. uses membership in A.A. itself as a granfalloon. Those
who do The Twelve Steps are &quot;one of us&quot;, the people who understand,
the members of the right religion, <i>&quot;The Friends of Bill&quot;</i>,
while those who don't do The Steps
are <b><i>the other people</i></b>, those
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunks</a>&quot;
who aren't our friends and who cannot be trusted.
<p>
In the <i>Big Book</i>, an A.A. member says of a non-member:
<p>

Often, how people take the news depends on how you present it.
<p>
The TV series <i>The West Wing</i> recently gave us a beautiful
illustration of that. The administration had a problem with
some new, improved equations for computing the threshold of
poverty. The problem was that the new equations said that there
were two million more poor people than the old equations did.
Nobody wanted to face the next election with two million more
poor people than there were when the President took office.
Everybody around the White House was stuck in a loop of,
&quot;We want to fix the equations, but we don't want there to
be more poor people.&quot; Then they took the problem to Toby, the
resident political hack spin doctor:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Did I ever tell you about the guy who had a batch of
pink salmon that turned white? He canned it up and printed on the label,
<i>'Guaranteed not to turn pink in the can.'</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;So the equations have been broken for fifty years?
What was the matter with all of the previous administrations?
Why didn't those lazy bums fix the problem? This is outrageous!
Thank God we finally have a President who is doing his job!<br>

In March of 2006, Microsoft found that its new operating system, Vista, was
so buggy that they wouldn't be able to bring it to market for the 2006 Christmas season.
They publicly announced yet another postponement of the release date until after January
of 2007, the umpteenth one in four years of slipping schedules. Putting the best
spin-doctor's smiley-face on the situation, Microsoft spokesman and project manager
James Allchin said that the Vista delay was the &quot;right thing&quot; to do.

In 2006, the Washington Post hired an unqualified college flunk-out as a reporter for &quot;the Right-wing viewpoint&quot;,

<p>
For example, if you can't prove that your nostrum can cure the
common cold, advertise that a well-known &quot;independent
testing laboratory&quot; has proven that it can kill umpteen
zillion germs in a test tube in just a few minutes. Advertise
those results by showing a picture of a doctor in a white coat
reporting the results. Don't bother to mention the bothersome
little fact that killing
germs in a test tube isn't the same thing as killing them inside
of people. And don't bother to mention the fact that the germs that
got zapped in the test tube were something other than cold germs...
The real meaning of the one true fact &#8212; that the nostrum
simply killed some unidentified germs in a test tube, gets lost
in the hype.
That's a semiattached figure.
<p>
<font color="blue">
(And, if you think about it for a minute, plain old Clorox bleach is
great for killing germs in a test tube, but if you drink the stuff to
get over a cold, you won't...)
</font>

<p>
Similarly, you can easily think of some popular household
cleaners whose advertisements imply that your family will be much
healthier and more disease-free because their product kills lots
of germs on contact.
Nobody asks whether those unfortunate germs were actually harmful
to humans. The vast majority of bacteria and microbes are really
totally harmless, which is why we are still alive.
In fact, recent studies have shown that
the constant, habitual use of germ-killers on everything, everywhere,
is just breeding super-bugs who are immune to our antibiotics,
which is a real medical disaster. But an ad that says,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Laboratory
testing has shown that our kitchen cleaner kills 300% more germs
on contact&quot;</font>
sure sounds good, doesn't it?

Darrell Huff noted:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There are often many ways of expressing any figure. You can, for
instance, express exactly the same fact by calling it a one per
cent return on sales, a fifteen per cent return on investment,
a ten-million-dollar profit, an increase in profits of forty
per cent (compared with 1935-39 average), or a decrease of sixty
per cent from last year. The method is to choose the one that
sounds best for the purpose at hand and trust that few who read it
will recognize how imperfectly it reflects the situation.<br>

<p>

For example, if you run a store, and buy an item for 99 cents
every morning, and sell it for $1.00 every afternoon, you are only
making a 1% profit on sales, which sounds terrible. But in a year
of doing that,
you make a 368% return on investment (365*100/99), which sounds
like you are making out like a bandit.

<p>
In another example of the semiattached figure, in a management-labor
dispute, the management questioned the workers about their gripes
against the union. They collected every trivial complaint that had
ever been lodged against the union, added up the numbers, and
announced that 78% of the workers were &quot;against the union.&quot;
Obviously, there is a huge difference between disagreeing with the
union about something or other, at one time or other, and being
against the union representing the workers.

Recently, the NBC Evening News used this trick to sensationalize a story about teenagers
buying alcohol over the Internet (9 August 2006).
They declared that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;One in 10 teenagers knows another teenager who has illegally
ordered liquor online.&quot;</font><br>
That sounds pretty impressive, and it hints that one in 10 teenagers
is getting supplied alcohol by another teenager who gets it through the
Internet.
It sounds impressive, until we realize that if the average teenage knows 100 other
teenagers, then only 1 in 1000 teenagers needs to have bought alcohol
through the Internet just once in order for that NBC statement to be true.
(And if the average teenager knows more than 100 other teenagers, then
even fewer teenagers need to have bought alcohol through the Internet.)
And just because a teenager knows someone who once bought alcohol through
the Internet doesn't mean that he got any of it.

When Peter Howard defended the cult leader
Frank Buchman and his Moral Re-Armament organization in the booklet
<i>Fighters Ever</i> (November, 1941), Howard used the
trick of the <i>Semi-Attached Figure</i> in his story about the
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#Nazi_like" target="_blank">controversy over drafting
Buchman's Moral Re-Armament followers</a> into the British army during World
War II. The Buchmanites
claimed that the MRA men were all &quot;lay evangelists of an established
religion&quot;, and as such, should not be drafted,
and they got 174 Members of Parliament to sign a motion
that asked that the MRA men be given special exemptions to the draft.
Peter Howard wrote in his book that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the elected representatives of more than
11,000,000 people&quot;</font> opposed drafting MRA members.
Peter Howard implied that all 11 million of those British people were unanimous
in their support of draft exemptions for the MRA men, which was nowhere near the
truth.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt15">15</a></sup></font>
<p>
Furthermore,
those 174 Members of Parliament had been elected on the basis of other issues
than drafting MRA members, so those 11 million represented British people had
never really voted on that particular issue at all.
And then, when the whole
of the British Parliament voted, and decided not to give the MRA men any special exemptions,
Peter Howard did not bother to write that
<font color="blue">
&quot;the elected representatives of
all 40 million Britons decided to draft the MRA men just like everybody else&quot;.

so much more valid than round numbers, even if they aren't accurate,
or can't really be applicable. So use exact numbers in
arguments, when you wish to impress people.
<p>
Compare these two statements:<br>
1.) The average American made about $25,000 last year.<br>
2.) The average American made $24,979.37 last year.

You can say &quot;We want&quot; instead of &quot;I want,&quot;

Politicians routinely say, &quot;The American people want...&quot;, rather than
&quot;I want...&quot; when they win an election, but they don't say &quot;The
American people want...&quot; when the vote goes against them.
Then they just complain that somebody cheated and stole the election, or their opponents
took a lot of improper campaign contributions, or the voters got fooled, or something.

<p>
Politicians make statements like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The American people don't want government controlling their health care options.&quot;

(Never mind the fact that the FDA already does, in many ways.) You aren't supposed to
notice that it's the politician who objects to government involvement
in health care, not the American people who have little or no health care.
They very much want the government giving them some health care options.

The cult leader Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman gave us an example of this propaganda
technique

when he said</a>, in 1936,
<p>
<blockquote>

That's how he felt.</br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So what on earth does the opinion of Frank Buchman's barber have to do
with anything? Well, Buchman could put forth the opinion that Hitler
had saved all of Europe from Communism while pretending that it
was someone else's opinion besides his own. It tended to
add weight to his own statements:<br>

Likewise, when Acting Vice President Dick Cheney cursed and used

he later tried to <a href="#rationalize">rationalize</a>

No, actually, it wasn't what they expected.<br>
G. W. Bush didn't bother to mention the extremely dangerous, threatening,
Weapons of Mass Destruction (&quot;45 minutes to launch&quot;) which
the U.S. taxpayers really <i>did expect</i> him to find.<br>
Nor did he mention the claimed connections to the al Qaeda terrorists which
he had claimed threatened Americans (&quot;Sadam will give al Qaeda a nuke or something.&quot;)<br>
And the U. S. taxpayers <i>really</i> didn't expect Dick Cheney's friends at 
the Halliburton corporation to get multi-billion-dollar contracts on a no-bid basis.<br>
And the U. S. taxpayers didn't expect war profiteers to empty the national treasury

We &quot;constructively criticized&quot; someone who needed it,
when our real motive was to win a useless argument. Or, the person
concerned not being present, we thought we were helping others
to understand him, when in actuality our true motive was to feel
superior by pulling him down. We sometimes hurt those we love
because they need to be &quot;taught a lesson,&quot; when we
really wanted to punish. We were depressed and complained we felt
bad, when in fact we were mainly asking for sympathy and attention.
This odd trait of mind and emotion, this perverse wish to hide
a bad motive underneath a good one, permeates human affairs from
top to bottom.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 94.</font>

<font color="blue">
Such a negative, poisonous view of human life.
When Bill Wilson wrote <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
he was in the middle of an 11-year case of chronic, deep, crippling,
clinical depression. It's easy to see why.

If our tempers are consistently bad, we arouse anger in others.
If we lie or cheat, we deprive others not only of their worldly
goods, but of their emotional security and peace of mind.
We really issue them an invitation to become contemptuous
and vengeful. If our sex conduct is selfish, we may excite
jealousy, misery, and a strong desire to retaliate in kind.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

the harms we do.<br></font>

<li> There is one more twist to the &quot;we are guilty&quot;

but you will hear plenty of it in A.A. meetings:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>

&quot;It took me years to learn to do all Twelve of the Steps,

and realize that I had to work <i>all</i> of the Steps <i>all</i> of

You also need to learn that you <b>must</b> <i>work all of the Steps all of

But the speaker never offers us any explanation for how he was able to
stay dry for so many years without bothering to
<i>&quot;Work The Steps&quot;</i> properly. That would be good to
know. We could save a lot of lives with that technique:<br>

Frank Buchman used this technique in his quote above &#8212;

<a name="tokenism"> </a>
<li> <b>Tokenism</b><br>
This is a well-known stunt. A company that does not wish to be
accused of racism or sexism hires one Token Negro, or one token
woman, and prominently displays the token right out front.
Some firms hire a black woman for the receptionist, thus
killing two birds with one stone.

<a name="AMA_review"> </a>
Bill Wilson published Doctor Silkworth's letter in the <i>Big Book</i>,
and used it to imply that the medical establishment strongly approved of
Bill's wonderful new plan to cure all of the alcoholics with cult religion.
Dr. Silkworth was A.A.'s token doctor.
Then Bill added an appendix to the second edition,
<i>&quot;The Medical View on A.A.&quot;</i>,
which listed five more doctors who said something
nice about Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Bill Wilson didn't
bother to mention the fact that the American Medical Association
reviewed the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> when it was first published,
and they found it to be a bunch of useless old garbage with no merit.
That was the real &quot;Medical View&quot; on Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>
On October 14, 1939, the Journal of the American Medical Association
published the following review of
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: How More Than One Hundred Men Have
Recovered from Alcoholism&quot;</i>:
<p>

<center>
<table border="4" bordercolor="#9F0000" width="93%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The seriousness of the psychiatric and social problem represented by addiction to alcohol is generally underestimated by those not
intimately familiar with the tragedies in the families of victims or the resistance addicts offer to any effective treatment. Many
psychiatrists regard addiction to alcohol as having a more pessimistic prognosis than schizophrenia.
<p>

For many years the public was beguiled into believing that short courses of enforced abstinence and catharsis in &quot;institutes&quot; and
&quot;rest homes&quot; would do the trick, and now that the failure of such temporizing has become common knowledge, a considerable
number of other forms of quack treatment have sprung up.
<p>

The book under review is a curious combination of organizing propaganda
and religious exhortation. It is in no sense a scientific book, although
it is introduced by a letter from a physician who claims to know some of
the anonymous contributors who have been &quot;cured&quot; of addiction
to alcohol and have joined together in an organization which would save
other addicts by a kind of religious conversion.
<p>

The book contains instructions as to how to intrigue the alcoholic addict
into the acceptance of divine guidance in place of alcohol in terms
strongly reminiscent of Dale Carnegie and
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">the adherents of the Buchman
(&quot;Oxford&quot;) movement</a>. The one
valid thing in the book is the recognition of the seriousness of addiction
to alcohol. Other than this, the book has no scientific merit or interest.

<i>The doctors at the American Medical Association immediately saw that Bill Wilson's
&quot;new spiritual program&quot; was just a clone of Frank Buchman's cult religion.</i>
</font>
<p>
Bill never mentioned any of that. He just said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This work has claimed the attention of prominent doctors and institutions who
say without hesitation that in a few years time, as it gains impetous,
thousands of hitherto incurable cases may recover. Such people as the chief
physician of Charles B. Towns Hospital and psychiatrists of the Johns Hopkins
Hospital at Baltimore express such opinions.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="_blank"><b>The One Hundred Men Corporation Prospectus</b></a>,
December 1938, page 4.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that &quot;the chief
physician of Charles B. Towns Hospital&quot; was none other than
Dr. William D. Silkworth, the doctor who gave Bill Wilson the quack medicine
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">belladona cure</a>&quot;
while Bill was detoxing from alcohol.
So basically, Bill's grandiose claim of many endorsements
from the medical community really boils down to just
one from his own doctor and a couple from psychiatrists at Johns Hopkins.
(Then Bill got a few more
for the appendix added onto the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i> &#8212;
including an endorsement from Dr. Harry Tiebout,
Bill's psychiatrist, who also said that Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">immature,
narcissistic, and grandiose</a>.)

<p>
And, speaking of tokens, Rev. Sam Shoemaker was Bill's token Protestant minister,
and Father Edward Dowling, S.J., was Bill's token Catholic priest. Bill
used both of them to try to imply that the theology of A.A. was
not <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">bizarre and heretical</a>.

This is well-known too. Everybody is doing it. Forest Gump
was paid $25,000 to tell everybody that he just loved to play ping-pong
with his Flexo-Lite Ping-Pong Paddle, which wasn't true, but
Momma said that just a little white lie wouldn't hurt...
<p>
Sports heroes and movie stars are constantly telling us that
we can be so much happier if we just do like they do, and use
a certain product...
<p>

It is an advertising truism that stories sell. A commercial that
just tells the true facts about a product will often be a real failure,
but a commercial that tells a story can be very convincing &#8212;<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I just couldn't lose weight; none of the diets worked for me;
I was miserable. I didn't dare to go to the beach and appear in

wear a size twelve...&quot;

By the way, you can tell that you are getting a scripted testimonial when you hear
the word &quot;product&quot;.  Real people don't buy &quot;products&quot;. They
may buy diet pills or other drugs or low-calorie drinks, or hair conditioner, or
all kinds of stuff, but they don't go shopping for &quot;product&quot;. I never
bought &quot;product&quot; in my life. I never went to the store to get &quot;product&quot;,
and I never went online to buy &quot;product&quot;.
When people start talking to you about &quot;product&quot;, you know that you are
getting just another standard canned sales pitch.
<p>
Also notice how interchangeable the commercials are. When the women in infomercials
sit around talking about how happy they are now that they got their husbands to
use &quot;this product&quot; (which might be a weight-loss
formula in this case), just a little retitling could make the same testimonial into
an advertisement for something entirely different, like a hair-restoration product
or an erectile disfunction drug.

In an infomercial for a stock market trading program, a man

Wow. That sounds great. We should get in on that right away,
shouldn't we, if it is that easy to make big money?
<p>
Ah, but they didn't tell us how many other
times the guy traded stocks for two hours and lost $7000, did they?
They just imply that the guy is a very successful trader who is consistently
making big profits.
And they didn't tell us anything about how the average trader fares.

A study of such trading programs conducted by the SEC found that more

Cults are notorious for trotting out a chorus line of poster children
who all give testimonials about how the cult is just the
greatest thing since sliced bread, and it has done such wonderful
things for them, and their leader is God's gift to mankind.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is non-stop testimonials. The last two-thirds of
the <i>Big Book</i> is all testimonials,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#anecdote" target="_blank">all people telling stories</a>
about how they just love A.A. and the Twelve Steps,
and how it made their lives so wonderful...
But the book does not tell any stories about the millions of other
people whom the faith-healing 12-Step religion did not help.
The <i>Big Book</i> tells us nothing about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">all of the people
who relapsed and went back out and died drunk</a> &#8212; it doesn't even mention
the <i>Big Book</i>'s co-author
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_relapse" target="_blank">Henry Parkhurst</a>, who died drunk.
Such a &quot;proof&quot; with testimonials is very one-sided, and only
tells half of the story.
<p>
In addition, there is no actual evidence that those people
who did get sober actually got sober <i>because of</i> Alcoholics Anonymous.
There is no demonstration of any cause-and-effect relationship between
joining A.A. and getting sober.
That critical factor is just assumed and glossed over.

<p>
And every A.A. meeting is more testimonials, people telling their stories,
and claiming that A.A. saved their lives, not that they saved
their own lives by quitting drinking...<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
And of course you will not hear from any of the other people who found
the A.A. program to be of no help, and quit coming back.

<a name="one_similarity"> </a>
<li> <b>The Fallacy of One Similarity</b><br>

Two different things are declared to be the same thing based on
just one point of similarity (or just a few).
<p>
For instance,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Your father is authoritarian. The cult leader
is authoritarian. Therefore they are just the same, and you
should trust the cult leader just like you trust your father.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Obviously, you could continue that through a number of other characteristics
like,
<ul>
<li> both are men
<li> both are balding
<li> both have fat bellies
</ul>
but that would still overlook the single most important difference
between the two men:
The father probably has the best of intentions towards his child, while
the cult leader is a psychopath who abuses and exploits people.
<p>
It's easy to see how this logical fallacy can get extended into
stereotyping groups on the basis of just one characteristic:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;All of those tree-huggers are opposed to logging this stand of
old-growth trees. Therefore, they are all eco-terrorists who
will do anything to block progress.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson had a dramatic &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; or hallucinatory
experience, and thought he saw God, when he was sick and detoxing from alcohol
in Towns Hospital and getting Dr. Silkworth's
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">Belladonna Cure</a>&quot;
(which was a hallucinogenic drug cocktail), and
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">while also being tormented
and indoctrinated</a> by recruiters from Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult.
After reading in William James' book, <i>The Varieties of
Religious Experience</i>, that some people have profound religious experiences
when they are really down, in despair and great pain, Wilson decided that
using the Oxford Groups techniques to put people down,
crush their egos, and make them feel powerless and hopeless
would recreate his &quot;religious&quot; experience in them.
He was wrong. It doesn't work.
<p>
Bill Wilson made the big mistake of seizing upon a few points of similarity between
what happened to him and what he read in James' book, while ignoring the many large
differences:
<ul>
<li> James' subjects weren't on hallucinogenic drugs,
<li> they weren't suffering from <i>Delirium Tremens</i> while detoxing from alcohol,
<li> and they weren't having their minds &quot;changed&quot; by
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#conviction" target="_blank">Oxford Group recruiters</a>.
</ul>

<p><br>
<a name="one_dissimilarity"> </a>
<a name="dissimilarity"> </a>
<li> <b>The Fallacy of One Dissimilarity</b><br>
This technique is simply the converse of <i>The Fallacy of One Similarity</i> &#8212;
find one difference between two things, and then declare that they are completely
different.
<p>
For example,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous cannot be a cult because there isn't a
strong leader who commands and controls everybody.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That illogic ignores the fact that there are
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">many dozens of different defining characteristics of a cult</a>,
and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_charismatic" target="_blank">
<i>A Charismatic Leader</i></a> is just one of them.

<p>
Besides, Alcoholics Anonymous <i>did have</i> a charismatic leader as
its founder &#8212; Bill Wilson. The founder
Bill Wilson is now dead, but A.A. is still ruled by the occult practices and customs
that he established, and through
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">the crazy things that he wrote in his books</a>.
<p>
And a cult does not stop being a cult just because the leader dies. Scientology,
the Hari Krishnas (ISKCON), the Moonies (Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church),
 Jim Jones' People's Temple, The Branch Davidians of &quot;David Koresh&quot;, and
Alcoholics Anonymous are all cults that now worship dead founders. And yes, the
People's Temple and the Branch Davidians churches still exist and they still have some
followers and true believers, in spite of the fact that the majority of both cults
died in spectacular mass suicide&#8212;mass murder blowouts.

When you find a snake that has red, yellow, and black bands all around
it, it's obviously just a harmless King Snake, isn't it? So you pick it up to take
it home as a pet. It turns around and bites you and you die. What was
the logical error? A Coral Snake also has red, yellow, and black bands
all around it, and it isn't harmless. The two snakes look very similar, but they
are not the same thing at all.

Similarly, if a politician looks like a respectable and honest man, he
must really be one, right? I mean, he's dressed in a fine suit and tie, isn't he?
And he gives rousing speeches, doesn't he? &#8212; Speeches full of fine words like
God, country, patriotism, and freedom. So he must be a great statesman, right?

<p>
If a TV evangelist has a Bible in one hand, and a cross in the other,
and dresses impecably and speaks softly and piously and says all of the
right slogans and prays a lot and looks just like a real holy man, then
he must be one right?
...Even if he is preaching hatred and the advocating the assassination
of somebody he doesn't like. All in the name of Jesus.

<p>
Conversely, if a young black man with a knit cap looks like a hoodlum
gang member, then he must be one, right?

Many animals take advantage of this confusion of appearances by appearing

<a name="suggestions"> </a>
<li> <b>Sly Suggestions</b><br>

Plant sly suggestions. Do not make solid statements which can
be proven wrong; rather, just suggest that your ideas may be
true. Then, often, perhaps a little while later, you might suddenly
start assuming that all of your suggestions are really true.
<p>
This technique is basically the old strategy of first just getting your toe in
the door, and then later gradually working your way in.
With this technique, the speaker first gets his toe into the door of
someone's mind by merely <i>suggesting</i> that an idea <i>may be true</i>
(which isn't too hard to accept, because it's only a suggestion that might be true),
and then the speaker gradually pushes further in by assuming that the suggestion
really is true.

<p>
For instance:
<ul>
<li> &quot;You may be a winner...&quot;
<li> &quot;You may have already won $10,000,000. Just subscribe to
a bunch of magazines and see...&quot;
<li> &quot;You may be the next winner...&quot;
<li> &quot;Your opinion may be worth $1000.&quot;
<li> &quot;This diet plan may be the one that works for you...&quot;
<li> &quot;This cream may be a make-up artist's dream come true...&quot;
<li> &quot;This get-rich-quick scheme may be the answer to all of your
problems...&quot;
<li> &quot;Science and astrology: Are they really at odds?&quot;
<li> &quot;Could a Chinese Herb Replace Life-Threatening RA Drugs?&quot;
<p> <li> Con artists who tout stocks on the stock market say of their latest &quot;hot stock&quot; that
a &quot;Big move could happen.&quot;<br>

A commercial for a weight-loss pill says, &quot;If your weight loss is too rapid, then cut down

On December 5, 2005, Condoleeza Rice used the same word game in her attempt
to explain to the European countries the illegal American practice of
 &quot;rendition&quot; &#8212; kidnapping people and shipping
them to other countries that permit torture, where they will be forcefully
interrogated.
Condoleeza said that we had always had a problem with
&quot;what to do with these individuals whom we <i>know</i> are believed to be
terrorists.&quot;<br>
We get an absolute certainty &#8212; she spoke the word &quot;know&quot; with strong emphasis &#8212;
followed by a vague belief. Condoleeza used
<a href="#passive_voice">the passive voice</a>
to declare that some unnamed person <i>believes</i> that some guy is a terrorist.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Yeh, we <b>know</b> with certainty that Joe Blow the village idiot thinks that
Abdul is a terrorist.&quot;</i></font><br>
That is Condoleeza's lame-brained justification for violating international
law and besmirching the reputation of the United States of America.
<p>
<font color="blue">
By the way, I <i>know</i> that some people believe that George W. Bush is a terrorist.
And so are Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and General Jerry Boykin. They murder innocent
people.

A commercial on TV says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Two years ago, I had a heart attack. Right there where Tina
is standing. If it weren't for Bayer aspirin, who knows?&quot;<br>
</font>
They did not say that Bayer aspirin actually did anything
good for the guy. They didn't even
say that the guy actually took any aspirin.
They just want to strongly hint that
aspirin saved the guy's life, because he presumably took some of it
while having a heart attack.

</ul>

<p><br>
Bill Wilson was a past master of this technique, and used it frequently:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit
entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the
amount you take, <font color="#9F0000">you are probably</font> alcoholic.
<font color="#9F0000">If that be the case, you may be</font>
suffering from an illness which only a
spiritual experience will conquer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To one who feels he is an
atheist or agnostic such an experience
seems impossible, but to
continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an
alcoholic of the hopeless variety.
<font color="#9F0000">
To be doomed to an alcoholic death
</font>
or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy
alternatives to face.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 44.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill neatly tap-danced and segued from a diagnosis of
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;you <font color="#9F0000">may</font> be sick&quot;
</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;you <font color="#9F0000">might</font> need a spiritual experience&quot;
</font>
to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;you are doomed to an alcoholic death if you don't join my
'spiritual' program&quot;</font>,
without a single new fact to support the sudden change in medical diagnosis.
He just started assuming that all of his previous suggestions were
unquestionably true.
Then Bill Wilson used the <a href="#either_or"><i>Either/Or</i> propaganda trick</a>
to present the reader with only two limited choices &#8212; join his cult or die:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;To be doomed to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy
alternatives to face.&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
<a name="instincts_gone_astray"> </a>
In his second book, Bill Wilson used a <i>Sly Suggestion</i> this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By now the newcomer <font color="#9F0000">has probably</font> arrived at the following conclusions:
that his character defects, representing instincts gone astray, have
been the primary cause of his drinking and his failure at life...<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 50.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, by now, the newcomer has <i>probably</i> come to the conclusion that
Bill Wilson was a raving lunatic, and the newcomer has quit going to
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings altogether.
(At least ninety-five percent of the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">newcomers to A.A. drop
out</a> in the first year.)<br>
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green"><i>
Oh, and Bill Wilson's &quot;primary cause&quot; of drinking is bogus and
just so much delusional nonsense &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;character defects, representing instincts gone astray&quot;</font>.
Bill Wilson had a zillion such goofy
&quot;<a href="orange-secrets.html#cause_list" target="_blank">primary causes</a>&quot;
of drinking and alcoholism, and they were all wrong.
</i></font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice how Bill Wilson used <i>Sly Suggestions</i> in this paragraph of
instructions to the wives of alcoholics, where Bill did a clever tap-dance
and slipped and slid from
talking about how the husbands must quit drinking to declaring that the
husbands must &quot;discover&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's Oxford Group version of God</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There is another paralyzing fear. You <font color="#9F0000">may</font> be afraid your husband
will lose his position; you are thinking of the disgrace and hard
times which will befall you and the children.
This experience <font color="#9F0000">may</font> come to you.
Or you <font color="#9F0000">may</font> already have had it
several times. Should it happen again, regard it in a different
light.
<font color="#9F0000">Maybe</font> it will prove a blessing!
It <font color="#9F0000">may</font> convince your husband
he wants to stop drinking forever. And now you know that he can
stop if he will! Time after time, this apparent calamity has been
a boon to us, for it opened up a path which led to the discovery
of God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>To Wives</i>, page 116.</font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Bill Wilson started off talking about how bad it
<font color="#9F0000"><i>might</i></font>
be if the husband lost his job.
<li> Then Bill declared that it <font color="#9F0000"><i>might</i></font> be a blessing...
&#8212; that such a calamity
<font color="#9F0000"><i>might</i></font>
provide the impetus for the husband to quit drinking.
<li>
Then Bill suddenly assumed that his suggestions were true, and
totally changed the subject and declared that the husband could quit
drinking if he wished to, which means that the husband is not "powerless over alcohol" like
Step One says, and then Bill Wilson concluded that everything was wonderful because
so many husbands had found Bill's Buchmanite version of God.<br>
<font color="blue">
So that also makes it
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives" target="_blank">a bait-and-switch trick</a>:
First the goal is to get the husbands to quit drinking, and then
the goal is to get the husbands to &quot;come to believe&quot; in Bill Wilson's religion.
</font>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even the commandment to <i>&quot;Work The Steps!&quot;</i> was
delivered in this sly back-door manner. On the second page
of chapter five of the <i>Big Book</i> (page 59), it
says that the Twelve Steps are merely
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;suggested as a program of recovery.&quot;</i></font>
Bill Wilson didn't want to write that. He wanted the Twelve Steps
and all of the rest of his dogmatic cult religion to be requirements of
membership in A.A., just like how, back in the early days,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender2Bob1" target="_blank">
&quot;surrendering to God&quot; was required before an alcoholic
could attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings</a>.
But more moderate A.A. members strongly objected to that because
they clearly foresaw that Bill Wilson's extreme religiosity was going to
drive away many of the very alcoholics whom the program was supposed
to help.
<p>
So, after a loud and long screaming contest, Bill was forced to
compromise and write that the Twelve Steps were just &quot;suggested as a program
of recovery&quot; (The <i>Big Book</i>, page 59).
<p>
Bill Wilson did his best to put a smiley-face on the situation by
later declaring that his
critics &quot;had opened the A.A. door wide to all, even the atheists
and agnostics&quot;, but Bill was really secretly nursing a resentment.
So, on the very first page of the next chapter that he wrote, chapter six,
Bill planted a sly suggestion that also used
<a href="#emotions">the fear-mongering propaganda technique</a>:
<p>
<center>
<font color="#4f007f"><b>
&quot;If we skip this vital step, we
<font color="#9F0000">may not</font> overcome drinking.&quot;<br>
</b></font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, page 72.)</font><br>
</center>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">Then again, we might. Heck, I did. In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the vast majority of successfully
recovering alcoholics do</a>.</font>

<p>
Bill gave us lots more examples of this mind-bending <i>Sly Suggestions</i>
technique.
The <i>Big Book</i> is loaded with them. To list just a few more:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just
as biased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit
as were the ancients about the realm of the
material?<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, Page 51.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
If you won't swallow Bill's bull, then <font color="#9F0000">maybe</font> you are
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudiced</a>,
biased, and unreasonable as all get-out.

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">Maybe</font>
<font color="blue">we are really messing with his mind now.</font>

<p>
<a name="simple_principles"> </a>
And <font color="#9F0000">maybe</font> the whole family should go join
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">the Al-Anon branch of the cult</a>:
<p>

or not, they <font color="#9F0000">may</font> do well to examine the principles by which the

</font>
these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails
somewhat in practicing them.

much as the wife who adopts a sane spiritual program, making a

Chapter 9, <i>The Family Afterward</i>, page 130.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson says that the whole family <font color="#9F0000"><i>may do well</i></font>
to join his religion, because Father is acting crazy again.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<font color="#9F0000">Maybe</font> they will really benefit from
Bill's version of Buchmanism.&quot;</i></font>
(The religious cult that just drove Daddy crazy.)<br>
Bill imagines that
<font color="#9F0000"><i>they can hardly fail</i></font> to agree with his program,
once they see how wonderful his &quot;simple principles&quot; really are.
(Actually, Bill Wilson's so-called
&quot;<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step12" target="_blank">simple principles</a>&quot;
were not really &quot;principles&quot;, they were
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#OG_practices" target="_blank">Oxford Group cult recruiting and
indoctrination practices</a>.)

<p>
Then Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#dont_nag" target="_blank">lectured the wives of alcoholics</a>,
telling them in several different ways not to nag their husbands to
quit drinking, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">not to nag their husbands to quit smoking</a>,
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>or else</i></font>, and Bill then made a few more <i>Sly Suggestions</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our next thought is that you should never tell him what he must do
about his drinking.
<font color="#9F0000">If</font>
he gets the idea that you are a nag or a
killjoy, your chance of accomplishing anything useful
<font color="#9F0000">may</font> be zero.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp; This <font color="#9F0000">may</font> lead to lonely evenings for you.
He <font color="#9F0000">may</font> seek someone else to console him &#8212;
<font color="#9F0000">not always another man</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, <i>To Wives</i>, page 111.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Bill was also using the propaganda trick of
<a href="#adverse_consequences"><i>Argue From Adverse Consequences</i></a>
there, to put the little woman in her place &#8212;
</font>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Don't nag your husband to quit drinking,

<p>
<font color="blue">
(Then again, <font color="#9F0000">maybe</font> he won't appreciate you at all.
<font color="#9F0000">Maybe</font> he'll just

waiting, but it will be worth
it. Meanwhile you might try to help the wife of another serious drinker.

<p>
<a name="example_vital"> </a>
And while you are out recruiting, here is how you handle a drinker who is perhaps not
a disgusting atheist:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

anything to what he already knows. But he will be curious to
learn why his own convictions have not worked and why yours seem
to work so well.
<font color="#4f007f">
He <font color="#9F0000">may</font> be an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.
</font><br></font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 93.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's a cute twist in the logic:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He
<font color="#ef0000">
<i>may be</i>
</font>
an example of one of Bill Wilson's
<font color="#ef0000">
<i>unquestionably-true</i>
</font>
religious beliefs.&quot;</font>

Bill is subtly slipping in another propaganda technique there:
<i><a href="#assume">Assume the Major Premise</a></i>.
Just assume that something is true, and talk like it is unquestionably
true, because you wish to fool others into believing that it is true,
and then divert attention away from that assumption by arguing about
something else, like <i>why</i> it is true:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>He <font color="#9F0000">may</font> be an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.</i>
</font><br></font>

Then again, he <font color="#9F0000">may</font> be an example of the truth
that religious beliefs really have very little to do with drinking beer...
<p>
Bill managed to pack more lies into that paragraph.
This one sentence contains no less than two lies:
<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>But he will be curious to learn why his own convictions have
not worked and why yours seem to work so well.</i>
</font><br></font>
<ul>
<li> Who says that the other guy's own convictions have not worked?<br>
Who says that the goal of all religious beliefs is to keep people
from drinking alcohol?<br>
I don't remember any of the Ten Commandments saying,
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Thou Shalt Not Drink Wine, Beer, Or
Hard Liquor&quot;</i>.<br></font>
<ul>
<li>
In fact, Christ's first miracle was making wine out of water, wasn't it?<br>
<li>
Didn't Jesus drink wine at the Last Supper?<br>
<li>
And don't many Christians drink wine at Communion?<br>
<li>
Don't Jews drink wine at Seder?<br>
</ul>
So having religious beliefs or convictions
does not always bar one from drinking alcohol.
And drinking alcohol does not prove that someone's religious
convictions have failed.
<p>

<li> And religious convictions don't <i>&quot;work&quot;</i>.
They are not supposed to &quot;work&quot;. That is, religious
convictions are <i>beliefs</i>. They are not machines like
cars or computers
that are <i>supposed</i> to do things, and <i>supposed</i> to
function in a certain manner.
And it is not really the job of religious convictions to control
people's indulgence in food, sex, drugs, or alcohol.

<p>
<li> The recruiter's convictions &quot;seem to have worked so well&quot;?
That <font color="#9F0000">may</font> well be a slick deception. The recruiter
<font color="#9F0000">could be</font> doing
the <i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#act_as_if" target="_blank">Fake It Until You Make It</a>&quot;</i> routine.
He <font color="#9F0000">may well</font> relapse and die drunk after doing a bunch of
enthusiastic recruiting, just like
<a href="orange-recruit.html#Jackie" target="_blank">Jackie did</a>
in the <i>Big Book</i>, and just like
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Paddy" target="_blank">Paddy did</a>,
and just like Bill Wilson's own recruiter,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">Ebby Thacher</a>,
did.
<p>
<li> Lastly, note the underhanded suggestion that the religious beliefs
of the A.A. members are better than the beliefs of other religions,
because the other religions didn't keep their people from drinking.
</ul>

<p>
You know, Bill Wilson <font color="#9F0000">just might have been</font>
one of the greatest, slickest, most consummate American con artists, when
it comes to lies, deceit, and propaganda techniques.

<li> <b>Misleading Inference</b><br>
<p>
Somebody who is selling a get-rich-quick scheme on late-night TV
shows you an accountant's statement that certifies that he is worth more
than a million dollars. But there is no evidence that the guy actually
made that much money
<font color="#9F0000">by using his get-rich-quick scheme</font>. He probably made
the money by <i>selling</i> the scheme on late-night TV.
<p>
Likewise, in an infomercial for a stock market trading program, a woman
says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I feel bad when I don't make $1000 a trade.&quot;<br>
</font>
Well okay, but how often does she feel bad? They didn't say anything
about that. They imply that she is so successful, and making so much
money, that it's an unusual and unhappy day when she doesn't make $1000.
But they actually presented us with no evidence to support that assumption.
For all we know, that poor woman could be feeling 'really bad' every day.

<li> <b>Unsubstantiated Inference and Groundless Claims</b><br>

<p>
Peter Howard complained bitterly about the criticism that his favorite
cult religion &#8212; Frank Buchman's Moral Re-Armament &#8212; was getting:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So many people are snobs of intellect. They write well, make money, gain titles

</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Britain and the Beast</i>, Peter Howard, 1963, page 112-113.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Peter Howard tried to imply that members of his religion really did do a good job of
helping people and changing them for the better, while his critics did not.
But Peter Howard provided no evidence to support that inference.
Actually, Frank Buchman's cult was notorious for also <i>not</i> changing
people. People would loudly proclaim that they had been &quot;changed&quot;
or &quot;saved&quot; at a big emotional rally or revival meeting or house party,
but they were very soon
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#OG_dropouts" target="_blank">back to their old bad habits</a>,
same as usual.


<p><br>
<a name="irrelevant_evidence"> </a>
<li> <b>Introduce Irrelevant Information as Supporting Evidence</b><br>

Here is an example of using irrelevant information as supporting evidence.
The cult leader Frank Buchman was working on converting a college student, and...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...finally the student said: &quot;I'm not going to be a Christian.&quot; &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then Frank asked him what he believed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Confucius,&quot; came the unusual answer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Wonderful!&quot; said Frank, deciding to humour him. &quot;Tell me
about Confucius.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Frank says his friend did not seem to know much on that subject.
But Frank
had been to China, and knew that Confucius said he could tell people how
to be righteous, but he hadn't the power to make them righteous.
Moveover, he had been to Confucius' grave, and been entertained at tea
by the seventy-sixth descendant of the Chinese sage and seen the seventy-seventh

<p>
The information that Frank Buchman visited the grave of Confucius is totally irrelevant.
It does not mean that Buchman knew
anything more about Confucianism than the student or anybody else.
Likewise, having had tea with a very distant descendant of Confucius is also
completely irrelevant trivia, even though it sounds good on the surface.
And to talk about having seen an even more distant descendant
on a very cold day is absurd.

<p>
The author also used the propaganda technique of making an
<a href="#unsubstantiated_inference"><i>Unsubstantiated Inference</i></a>,
implying that Frank Buchman, unlike Confucius, <i>did</i> have
<i>&quot;the power to make people righteous&quot;</i>.
Alas, Frank Buchman had no such power, either.
Frank Buchman was able to fool a few young college students and eccentric rich people
and make them think that they had been changed for the better,
but when it came to the people who really mattered the most
and who <i>really</i> needed to get &quot;changed&quot;, like
Heinrich Himmler, Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_not_changed" target="_blank">Frank Buchman totally failed</a>
to make good Christians out of them. So much for Frank Buchman's &quot;power
to make people righteous&quot;.

(Besides, what happened to

for themselves?)

<p>
A variation on this propaganda trick of introducing irrelevant evidence
is to state a bunch of irrelevant obvious platitudes, and then claim that they support
your program. Yammer a few trite hackneyed irrelevant clich&eacute;s and slogans like,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;People are more important than things&quot;</i></font>, and
then conclude that your cult is right about everything.

Adolf Hitler and the Nazis used this propaganda trick often. They conflated &quot;patriotism&quot; with all
kinds of crimes:
<ul>
<li> If you are patriotic, you will support killing the Jews.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will never criticize Adolf Hitler or his policies.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will support invading foreign countries like Czechoslovakia and Poland, and then Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, and the Ukraine.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will always vote for the Nazi Party.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will agree with Hitler about everything, and worship Hitler's words as the ultimate in wisdom. You will read <i>Mein Kampf</i> as your new bible.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will gladly join the Army and help Hitler to conquer and occupy all of Europe.
</ul>
<p>
In modern times, American politicians have used the same tricks for the same things:
<ul>
<li> If you are patriotic, you will support the War in Vietnam, and not criticize it.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will support invading Iraq.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will not complain about the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
<li> If you are patriotic, you will not notice that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq did not make America more secure.  
<li> If you are really patriotic, you will support the troops (rather than criticizing the war).
</ul>
It is possible to support the troops while objecting to an illegal war.
Criticizing lying politicians is not the same thing as criticizing the troops, but the politicians
don't want you to know that.

<p>
Politicians often use this trick to try to equate patriotism with not criticizing the President:
<ul>
<li> If you are patriotic, you will never disagree with the President.
<li> If you are really patriotic, you will support the President.
</ul>

Those things are not the same things at all, of course. Sometimes the highest
patriotism requires criticizing the elected leaders, rather than just going along
with their program, and letting them get away with anything.
Today, we regard those &quot;disloyal&quot; Germans who fought
against Adolf Hitler as the greatest of German patriots.
<p> 
More conflation: We routinely hear that the economy is improving because a bunch
of new jobs were created &#8212; as if all jobs are equal &#8212; &quot;a job is
a job, and just having one is wonderful.&quot; The people who are trying to fool
you with faked statistics try to equate low-paying jobs with high-paying jobs.
Someone who lost a high-paying manufacturing job and is now forced to take a
low-paying janitorial or burger-flipping job won't agree.

<p>
TV evangelists and religious cult leaders routinely conflate &quot;faith in God&quot; with believing whatever the preacher says.
When people begin to doubt the preacher, he says that they have &quot;lost faith in God.&quot;
Likewise, TV preachers conflate giving money to the preacher and giving money to God.  &quot;Giving money to God&quot;
and &quot;supporting the Lord's work&quot; means giving money to the preacher.

<p>
We can easily find plenty of examples of this stunt in Bill Wilson's

<p>
Also notice the switcheroo: Step One declares that alcoholics are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;,
and they just can't help taking a drink. But now alcoholics suddenly have a special understanding
of alcohol.
Many years of compulsively drinking in a &quot;powerless&quot; uncontrolled manner does produce special

But if she floats and lives, then she's guilty (because the Devil is holding
her up), so she gets burned at the stake.
<p>
Likewise,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If she confesses (under torture) to being a witch, then she is one.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If she denies being a witch, then that proves that she is an evil
witch who lies about being a witch.

Closer to home, Alcoholics Anonymous says that<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If you deny being an alcoholic, then that proves that you are a dishonest alcoholic who is

The Hazelden <i>Little Red Book</i> teaches us
that this is a &quot;symptom&quot; that indicates &quot;mental illness&quot;:

<p>
Bill Wilson gave us <a href="#good_selfish">another good example</a>
of a double bind earlier, when he declared that we were selfish and
unspiritual if we committed a bunch of sins and crimes, and we were
also selfish and unspiritual if we didn't commit a bunch of sins and
crimes, because, in the second case, we were just selfishly avoiding
punishment.<br>
Damned if you do, and damned if you don't.
<p>
Another common Alcoholics Anonymous double bind is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If I don't feel like going to a meeting, I usually NEED to.&quot;

<ol>
<li> If you feel like going to a meeting, you should go to a meeting.
<li> If you don't feel like going to a meeting, you should go to a meeting.

should spend your evening at one of their meetings.

Danny M. Wilcox teaches us, in his book of A.A. dogma, that alcoholics
are &quot;people pleasers&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
They spoke of the things they had been willing to do to please other people in
their lives.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The need to please others and the perceived failure to do so were often cited as among
the main reasons they drank. Generally, these members exhibited obvious anxiety
concerning the opinion of other people, which really emphasizes our social needs
as human beings.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholic Thinking: Language, Culture, and Belief in Alcoholics
Anonymous</i>, Danny M. Wilcox, page 86.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But five pages later, Wilcox also wrote that being selfish and not caring how
other people feel is a sign of alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Selfishness, self-centeredness! That is the root cause of all our problems&quot;
(AA 1976: 62). Everything revolves around self-centeredness.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Amazingly, when first introduced to AA most members said that they did not
think that they were especially self-centered. Some of them thought it patently
ridiculous to suggest that they were interested only in themselves, since they
could cite plenty of examples of their generosity and concern for others.
&nbsp; ...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Most members said that their selfishness just got worse as their dependence on
alcohol increased.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholic Thinking: Language, Culture, and Belief in Alcoholics
Anonymous</i>, Danny M. Wilcox, page 91-92.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So,
<ul>
<li>
you are an alcoholic if you care what other people think and feel,<br>
<li>
and you are an alcoholic if you don't care what other people think and feel.<br>
</ul>
Damned if you do, and damned if you don't.

<p>
They use the same trap on those people who are children of alcoholics:
<ul>
<li> If you strive to please yourself, that proves you are a
selfish, self-seeking alcoholic, and you need to join
Alcoholics Anonymous and do the Twelve Steps.
<li> If you strive to please other people, that proves you are
a neurotic &quot;people-pleasing&quot; Adult Child Of an Alcoholic,
and you need to join
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#group_list" target="_blank">Al-Anon or ACOA</a>
and do the Twelve Steps.
</ul>
Damned if you do, and damned if you don't. You can't get
out of it without joining some 12-Step group and doing the
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#moral_inventory" target="_blank">guilt-inducing Twelve Steps</a>.
<p>
For that matter, as Bill sees it, you can't ever escape from the Twelve
Steps. Just being related to an alcoholic dooms you to having
to do Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps for the rest of your life:
<ul>
<li> If you drink alcohol, like your relative, you have to join
Alcoholics Anonymous and do the Twelve Steps.
<li> If you don't drink alcohol, you have to join Al-Anon or ACOA
and do the Twelve Steps to treat your
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">spiritual disease</a>&quot;

<li> <b>Project Future From Past</b><br>

Assume that history repeats itself, and just because something
happened before, it will happen the same way again.
Especially, make the mistake of attributing the causes of events
to only one or two factors, while ignoring a lot of other factors.
<p>
For instance,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The last three times we had a full moon in
Aquarius, the stock of XYZ went up. So let's bet big on XYZ the
next full moon. It's a <i>can't-lose deal</i>.&quot;
</font>
The people who use astrology to try to
predict the stock market die broke, just like all of the
other cycle-trackers and wave-finders.

<p>
A corollary to projecting the future from the past is the notion that history
repeats itself. You will often hear someone arguing that we must do a
certain thing, or follow a certain path, because that was the best thing to
do back in 1938 in response to Hitler (or some such thing).
While it is wise to learn from history, it is also wise to learn that history
does not necessarily repeat itself.<br>

For instance, some people say that Adolf Hitler was a military genius,
who just went too far in killing the Jews. He was only beaten, they say,
because America overwhelmed Germany with supplies and equipment.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Fact: Adolf Hitler was a military fool. He constantly over-rode the
decisions of his generals, who grumbled about the war being run by
Corporal Hitler. Hitler lost battle after battle, and lost millions
of troops, by stupidly attacking the wrong places at the wrong
time, and refusing to retreat and save his armies when necessary.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And the Russians bore the brunt of the war, not the Western Allies.
The fighting on the Russian Front was an unbelievable nightmare,
featuring Russian human-wave attacks by the
&quot;punishment brigades&quot;.
They lost many, many millions of people &#8212; something like 14 million &#8212;
and gave a whole new meaning to the term &quot;cannon fodder&quot;,

The Moral Re-Armament cult leader Frank Buchman declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;We finance our work as [George] Washington financed his revolution &#8212; on our knees.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Moral Re-Armament: What Is It?</i>, page 106.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is just so much nonsense. George Washington most assuredly did not
finance the American revolution on his knees. He often had to beg the
Continental Congress to cough up some more cash and guns and supplies,
but he didn't do it on his knees.

<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
And the old painting that portrays George Washington praying
on his knees at Valley Forge perpetuates a myth. What George Washington
really said was,
<font color="blue">
&quot;I have examined the religion of the Christians, and the Jews, and the Musselman (Islam),
and in none of them do I find any virtue.&quot;
</font>
So much for financing the American Revolution on his knees.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Buchmanites repeated that false analysis of history
while they continued to harangue people to donate more money to Frank Buchman's cult:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#9F0000">
Maybe you should give everything you've got.</font>

<p>
<a href="orange-rroot720.html#give_everything" target="_blank">No, they didn't.</a>

<p>
Similarly, the often-heard claims that the United States of America is a nation that
was founded on &quot;Christian Principles&quot; or is &quot;based on
Christianity&quot; are also false.
The Founding Fathers were very careful to <i>not</i> incorporate any
religion into the Constitution of the United States. They had already
tasted a State-enforced religion in England &#8212; the Church of England &#8212;
and they didn't want any
more of that, so the Founding Fathers created the &quot;absolute firewall&quot; of separation
between Church and State. And where some colonies like Massachusetts and Maryland already
had laws that enforced one religion over another (death to Jews), they
had to nullify those laws in order to be part of the United States.

<p>
Another popular misinterpretation of American history is to say that the Vietnam War
happened because America was defending democracy in Vietnam...
There wasn't any democracy in Vietnam. There were a bunch of murdering heroin-dealing
generals running the southern half of the country.
The USA was fighting to keep control of the country, and keep
its puppet dictators in power, and to protect American investments, but not to protect
democracy or freedom. The truth is that there was never a free and fair election while the
USA dominated Vietnam. President Eisenhower wrote in his memoirs that it was obvious that
Ho Chi Minh would win any fair popular election by a landslide,
so the promised elections were not held.
Years later, they held some &quot;elections&quot; that were just stage-managed
affairs with only American-approved condidates allowed to run. And of course the American
selection, like the murderous Colonel Nguyen Kao Ky, was always the winner.

<p>
Even today, we still have a few racists in the USA whose analysis of history
is a bit warped &#8212; they will tell you
that the kindly Southern slave owners took good care of their slaves and
gave them everything that they needed. Why, those poor pathetic blacks would have been
lost without their kindly masters taking such good care of them...
Al Jolson's most popular song, &quot;Swannee&quot;, depicted a black man sentimentally pining away for
his beloved plantation on the Swannee River, where kindly massuh made life so good.
Ah, the good old days.

<p>
A popular variation on false history is to proclaim that current society is
decadent and immoral, not at all like the good old days when everything was wonderful.
But any reasonable analysis
of history shows that things have often been far worse than they are now, no matter whether
you are talking about sexual looseness, drug addiction, lawlessness, violent crime,
wars of conquest, cruel and oppressive rulers, plagues, alcoholism,
or social upheaval.
One of my favorite quotes on this subject was found in an ancient Egyptian tomb,
built 4000 years ago:<br>

The speaker ignores the fact that the whole premise of the Roman empire was immoral.
It was basically
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Rob, enslave, and murder others because you can get away with it &#8212;
you are bigger and stronger and more vicious than they are, and you have better steel swords.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Romans even invented crucifixion to punish and terrorize those people who objected to
being slaves of the Romans and giving all of their wealth to the Roman soldiers.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The &quot;immorality&quot; argument also ignores many other possible causes of the decline
of the Roman Empire, particularly the fact that most
of the later Roman Emperors appear to have been suffering from lead poisoning and were
insane. Lead dishes were fashionable for the rich back then, and they
even piped in their running water in lead pipes, so many of them suffered from brain
damage caused by a lifetime of lead poisoning. Some of those Roman emperors were raving
lunatics. It shows, when you read their history. But the
&quot;immorality&quot; argument ignores all of those other important facts, and just
tries to substitute a simplistic cause for a complex process.
<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And then there was the problem that Rome had a big silver mine in Spain.
They mined it heavily for a long time, and used the silver to pay the entire Roman army.
But when the miners dug to a certain depth, they hit an underground
stream and the mine flooded. They could not ever get the water out of
the mine, and the mine was finished. No more silver for Rome; no more
silver for the army. When they got no more pay, the Roman soldiers
deserted. Then the Vandals walked into Rome, and that was the end of
the Roman Empire. Somehow, the &quot;immorality&quot; seems to have been
largely irrelevant.

A courageous priest named Valentine performed secret

Bill Wilson similarly misinterpreted
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery" target="_blank">
the history of temperance movements</a>.
He declared that organizations like the Washingtonian
Society and Women's Christian Temperance Movement were failures
that didn't sober up any drinkers, and that Bill's Alcoholics Anonymous
program was the first working sobriety program in history.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Bill wasn't the first, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">A.A. doesn't work</a>.
<p>
And the reason that those other temperance organizations didn't spread
like cancers is because they were not evil mind-controlling cults that
convinced their followers that
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">they absolutely
<i>must</i> go recruiting</a> or else they will die.
<p>
Also see the example of <a href="#bait_switch">Hypnotic Bait And Switch</a> for
another example of the false analysis of history.

<p><br>
<a name="never_happened"> </a>
<li> <b>It's Never Happened Before</b><br>
This is also an appeal to a false analysis of history. Imply that something just cannot
happen because it has never happened before.
<p>
Variations:
<ul>
<li>
&quot;It can't happen here.&quot;
<li>
&quot;It hasn't happened yet.&quot;
<li>
&quot;It always happens this way, so it can't happen that way.&quot;
<li>
&quot;<i>These people</i> have never done such a thing before, so they won't do it now.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
Note that the statement that &quot;It never happened before&quot; does
not really need to be true.  This technique will work just fine if your
audience is ignorant of the fact that &quot;it&quot; actually did happen
before.



<p><br>
<a name="didnt_see_it"> </a>
<li> <b>I Didn't See It Happen, So It Never Happened</b><br>
Claim that something never happened, or something does not exist, because you
have not seen it.

As Carl Sagan said, &quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;
Just because you haven't seen any intelligent extra-terrestrials yet doesn't prove
that they don't exist.
<p>
Sexual exploitation is a problem in Alcoholics Anonymous.
The evidence is overwhelming.
The criminal behavior of A.A. groups like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the Midtown Group in Washington DC</a>
has even been reported on television and in national magazines like Newsweek.
Nevertheless, A.A. members who are in denial about the whole thing use the
argument
&quot;I never saw it happen. It never happened in our group, so it never happened.&quot;

<p>
This logical fallacy also ignores the logical problem that you cannot prove a negative.
Just because you haven't seen something does not prove that it doesn't exist.
For example, you cannot prove that Santa Claus does not exist. Just because you didn't
see him doesn't prove that he doesn't exist.
Even if you went to the North Pole looking for him and didn't find him, doesn't prove
that he doesn't exist. Santa could have been vacationing in Hawaii then.
<p>
 I have never seen Sophia Loren, Dustin
Hoffman, or Robert Redford either, so I guess they don't exist. Oh sure, I've seen
pictures of them, but those pictures could have been faked, just like the photos
of Santa Claus.
You see the problem. This could go on forever.

Back in 1978, the U.S. Government General Accouting Office investigated the Saudi Arabian
oil supply, just trying to figure out whether we were in any danger of insufficient oil supplies
sometime in the future:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i><b>Search for New Oilfields or New Wells</b></i>
<p>
The GAO investigative team was told that &quot;prospects for additional oil discoveries were
considered to be good.&quot; &nbsp;  ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In hindsight, Aramco's optimism about exploration prospects would prove unfounded.
After 25 years of increasingly intense geological and geophysical efforts and equally
intense exploratory drilling, Saudi Arabia failed to discover any significant new fields
other than the series of complex, lower-productivity, tight reservoirs in the Hawtah Trend.
History would prove, absent some major new discovery beyond 2005, that the last great
oilfield in Saudi Arabia was found close to a decade before the GAO report was submitted
to Congress.
<p>
<i><b>Rate of Oil Production</b></i>
<p>
Aramco's [the Arab-American oil company's] management, however, assured the GAO inspectors
that most oilfields in Saudi Arabia were not rate sensitive, and that the rate at which
each Saudi giant field was produced would not reduce the ultimate oil recovery from the field.
The only risk Aramco's management saw from accidentally overproducing a field was an increase
in the field's final production cost.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Aramco experts who spoke to the GAO team confidently told these investigators that current
production in at least some key fields could possibly be increased by as much as 50 percent
or more without significantly affecting the ultimate volume of recoverable oil. This optimism
also proved unfounded.<br>

<p>
The Sweeping Generality is a kind of exaggeration &#8212; Take something
that is partially true, or only true in some cases, and make a universal statement out of it.
For example, the former Miss USA got out of a rehab facility, and with her head still full of cult
slogans, went on the Jay Leno show and annnounced:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Everything that comes out of the mouth of an alcoholic or an addict is a lie.&quot;<br>
</font>
== Miss USA, Tara Conner, on the Jay Leno Show, 2 February 2007.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now it is true that addicts or alcoholics who are in a bad way, in the
depths of their addiction, will often lie to get more of whatever their
favorite drug is. But no way is <i>everything</i> that they say a lie.
Nor is their addiction the <i>only</i> motivation in their lives.
Nor are <i>all</i> addicts and alcoholics so desperate, and lying to get something.
<p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
What is funny there is that Miss Conner invoked <i>&quot;The Cretan's Paradox&quot;</i>
without realizing it.
<p>
That is the paradox created by Epimenides, a Greek from Crete, who went
before the Spartans and announced, &quot;All Cretans are liars.&quot;
The Spartans thought that was pretty funny, but they didn't realize the
gotcha:
<ul>
<li> The speaker Epimenides was himself a Cretan, from Crete.
<li> Therefore he must be a liar.
<li> But if he is a liar, then he was lying when he said that all Cretans are liars.
<li> So Cretans are not liars.
<li> So Epimenides must have been telling the truth when he said that all Cretans are liars.
<li> Therefore, Cretans must be liars.
<li> Therefore Epimenides must be a liar...
<li> So Epimenides was lying when he said that all Cretans are liars.
<li> So Cretans are not liars.
<li> ... etc. ... 'Round and 'round forever.
</ul>
<p>
When Tara Conner confessed to Jay Leno that she was an alcoholic, and then declared that everything that
comes out of the mouth of an alcoholic or an addict is a lie, she was creating the same paradox.
And Jay Leno knew it. He was actually wincing in pain as Tara Conner went on and on
about how bad alcoholics are.

Bill Wilson and a few of the other early A.A. members
had arrogant, domineering, egotistical, grandiose personalities,
so Bill declared that <i>all alcoholics in the world</i> had gigantic

were too big and too good to need God.
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">

When A.A. was quite young, a number of eminent psychologists and doctors

any, this group of alcoholics had in common. They finally came up with
a conclusion that shocked the A.A. members of that time.

<p>
If you lift just the five words
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I shot the bank teller&quot;

out of that sentence, it turns the question into a confession of guilt.
It completely reverses the meaning of the words. That is quoting out of context.

<p>
<a name="AAWS_Buchman"> </a>
Here is a good example of quoting out of context to create a desired impression:
<p>
In August of 1936, the religious cult leader
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_interview" target="_blank">Frank Buchman gave an interview
to William A. H. Birnie</a>, a newspaper reporter from the New York
<i>World-Telegram</i>, wherein he stated,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who
built a front line of defense against the anti-Christ of
Communism.&quot;</font><br>
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot840.html#World_Telegram" target="_blank">Read
the entire interview here</a>.<br>
<p>
While writing their history of Alcoholics Anonymous and biography of the founder
William G. Wilson,
the staff at Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. used the propaganda
technique of <i>taking quotes out of context</i>, as well as some other propaganda
techniques, to cover up the fact that Bill Wilson's spiritual teacher
was a Nazi sympathizer.
Charles Bufe described the AAWS machinations this way:
<p>
<center>
<table width="97%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" border="3">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font size="4" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

It's worth noting that Bill Wilson and his fellow AAs-to-be <i>must</i> have
known about this interview, which caused a public furor, yet they continued
to work as part of the Oxford Groups for more than another year in New
York and another three years in Akron.
                                                                                            
<p>
It's also worth noting that AA, in its official &quot;Conference-approved&quot; biography
of Bill Wilson, <i>Pass It On</i>, treats this matter in what can only
be described as a dishonest manner. This is all the more surprising and
disappointing in that the book's dust jacket proclaims, &quot;Every word
is documented, every source checked.&quot;

<p>
In the section of <i>Pass It On</i> dealing with Buchman's remarks, the anonymous
author states:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In August [1936], the New York <i>World-Telegram</i> published an article
about Buchman, charging that he was pro-Nazi. The newspaper quoted Buchman
as saying: &quot;Thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler who built a front-line
defense against the Anti-Christ of Communism. Think what it would mean
to the world if Hitler surrendered to God. Through such a man, God could
control a nation and solve every problem. Human problems aren't economic,
they're moral, and they can't be solved by immoral measures.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
While most discussion of the incident, even by Buchman's critics, have since
vindicated him, the article brought the group into public controversy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1" face="Times,Roman,Schoolbook">
[<i>PASS IT ON: The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message
reached the world</i>, authorship credited to 'anonymous', actually written by
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. staff, pages 170-171.]
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are several remarkable features in this passage. The first is that the
<i>World Telegram</i> piece is referred to as an &quot;article&quot; when in fact
it was an <i>interview</i> in which Buchman's comments comprised well over
half the text, with almost all of the remaining text consisting of descriptive
passages, transitions between Buchman's statements, and uncontroversial
background information on Buchman and the Oxford Group Movement. There
is a tremendous difference between an &quot;article&quot; in which
Buchman was &quot;charged&quot;
with being pro-Nazi and an <i>interview</i> in which he himself clearly
expressed pro-Nazi opinions, a fact which undoubtedly was not lost on the
author of AA's official Wilson biography.

<p>
Another remarkable feature of the passage just quoted from <i>Pass It On</i> is
that Buchman's statements are carefully edited to put his best possible
face forward. The anonymous AA author took fragments separated by hundreds
of words and patched them together as if they were a single statement,
while dropping a number of words within the fragments. For example, by
dropping the word &quot;But&quot; before the words &quot;think what it would mean
... ,&quot; the author made the fragments appear to fit together snugly &#8212; thus
hiding the fact that the &quot;statement&quot; is a patchwork.

<p>
In normal literary practice, it's considered proper to separate patched-together
fragments with ellipses if the intervening material doesn't alter the meaning
of the quoted material. If the intervening material does alter the meaning,
as it does in the &quot;statement&quot; cited in <i>Pass It On</i>, it's considered
unethical to quote it even with ellipses, and blatantly dishonest to quote
it as if it were a single unitary statement. It should also be noted that
the author of <i>Pass It On</i> quoted Buchman's &quot;statement&quot; in such a
way as to leave the impression that it was the <i>only</i> such &quot;statement&quot;
in the &quot;article.&quot;
<p>
Perhaps
most remarkably, the anonymous AA author concludes that, &quot;most discussions
of the incident, even by Buchman's critics, have since vindicated him.&quot;
One remarkable aspect of this statement is its deliberate fuzziness. What
was Buchman &quot;vindicated&quot; of? Of making pro-Nazi statements? Of being pro-Nazi?
Our AA author leaves that crucial matter unresolved.
<p>Further,
I've done my best to read <i>all</i> of the
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#circulated_criticisms" target="_blank">widely circulated criticisms</a>
of Buchman's remarks, and <i>none</i> &quot;vindicate&quot; him of making pro-Nazi
statements.

<li> <b>Begging The Question</b><br>
Get the desired answer by how the question is phrased.
<p>
Consider these two questions:
<ul>
<li> Do you favor reducing property taxes?
<li> Do you favor drastically reducing funding to schools and emergency
services?
</ul>

<p>
Most people will answer &quot;Yes&quot; to the first question, and
&quot;No&quot; to the second.<br>
The problem is, they are the very same question, as the citizens of
Oregon are now painfully discovering.
The Oregon voters answered &quot;yes&quot; to the first question in past
elections, and now they are faced with the consequences: not enough money
for schools and emergency services.

<p>
Similarly, A.A. recruiters ask alcoholics,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Well, wouldn't you like to escape from your addiction
and be healthy and happy and free?&quot;<br>
</i></font>

&#8212; But they really mean,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Wouldn't you like to join Alcoholics Anonymous and go to our meetings for the
rest of your life?&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
Variations on Begging The Question include:
<ul>
<li> The Chicken and Egg Argument

<p>
The Japanese Zen masters had a great answer for such questions:
&quot;Mu.&quot; &quot;Mu&quot; means neither &quot;yes&quot; nor
&quot;no&quot;; it means something
like, &quot;I reject your bogus question.&quot;

No matter what happened, or who did what to whom, claim that you are the victim of all kinds of attacks, and
nasty conspiracies, and slander and libel, and on and on.
<p>
Politicians use this trick often. A politician will attack his opponent with all kinds of criticism,
denunciations and slander, and even blatant lies, and when the opponent fights back and counter-attacks,
the first politician
takes on a wounded look and complains how unfair it is for his opponent to be so vicious.

<p>
While running for President,
Richard Nixon bragged that he had a secret plan for ending the War in Vietnam.
He couldn't tell anybody what it was, because it was a secret. But if you would just
vote for him, he would end the war. Well, he did eventually end the war, but
in the final analysis, his secret plan was just

In speaking about patterns of cult behavior in many of our government
institutions, Dr. Arthur Deikman wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Secrecy supports cult-like behavior, as we saw in the Life Force
group, where the hierarchy was
maintained through limiting access to information. Secrecy functions
not only to cover up unethical activities from outside eyes, but
also to increase authoritarian control over the larger group. By
promoting the idea that the leader or the in-group have special information
and expertise, they remove themselves from criticism and justify
the exclusion of others from the decision-making process.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the case of religious cults the special information and expertise
is described as divine inspiration or enlightenment. The cult leader's
presumed higher state precludes lower beings from judging his or her
actions. Similar claims are made in government where special
knowledge of the enemy or secret technical information is said to
justify decisions that would otherwise be objected to on moral or
even practical grounds.<br>

The former pretender to the throne in Washington D.C. claimed to have
special knowledge of what Saddam Hussein had been doing that required
that we eliminate him in a &quot;pre-emptive&quot; attack that resembled
Adolf Hitler's 1939 &quot;defense of Germany&quot; from Poland and its horse-mounted cavalry...
But we don't get to see what that special information is, before we attack...
Will it be any better than Nixon's plan to end the war in Vietnam?
Only the body count will say for sure.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And now that the war is over
(Shrub said so on that aircraft carrier, remember?),
we still haven't seen the
&quot;special intelligence&quot; that warned Bush that he had
to invade Iraq to defend America, nor have we seen the Weapons Of Mass
Destruction
that allegedly threatened America. So just what was the
real reason for the invasion?</font>
<p>
<font color="#990000">
Don't accept, &quot;To liberate Iraq.&quot; The USA does not
have the right to bomb and invade countries
whose leaders we do not like, to &quot;liberate&quot; them.
That is what the Communists used to say &#8212;
that they were &quot;liberating&quot; countries.
Like how Stalin liberated Poland, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania. 
And like how Khrushchev then liberated Hungary again.
&quot;Liberate&quot; is what China says it did to Tibet.
Besides, that is not what the Bush administration said in the beginning,
to get us into the war. They were claiming that Saddam had lots of
yellow-cake uranium from Niger, remember? Well he didn't.
And stockpiles of Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he didn't.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
UPDATE, 2004.06.19, The September 11 Commission released their report that said
that there was simply no evidence that Saddam Hussein had ever cooperated with Al Queda
to commit terrorist acts against the United States.
So acting Vice President Cheney went on television and said that they were wrong,
and that he knew more about it than the Commission did.<br>
<font color="#990000">
Oh? Did Dick Cheney withhold critical facts from the 9/11 Commission?
Did he lie to them?

The 9/11 Commission immediately asked for the vital information that Cheney
had withheld from the Commission, but Cheney refused to give them anything more.

there they are dead on the bath-room floor of a cheap motel room. When
you get a call from a thirteen year old child who's parents have already
introduced her to drugs and alcohol and has her out on the streets
hooking for them, and one of the other girls gives her a phone# to call

Use bad mathematics in calculating things.
<p>
One recent Internet hoax was a statement that listed a whole lot of crimes
committed by members of Congress. The unknown author then calculated the crime
rate of Congress as being several times higher than the average crime rate of the
American people, ostensibly proving that all of those politicians are a bunch
of crooks.
<p>
Be that as it may, the error was: The author listed all of the crimes ever committed
by anyone who had been a member of Congress in the recent past, but calculated
the crime rate as if all of those crimes were committed by just the current 535
members of Congress in just one year.
Hey Presto! The result was a grossly inflated crime rate for the members of Congress.
<p>
We could list
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">lots of examples of
Bill Wilson's bad mathematics</a> in computing the A.A. success rate,
but we have already covered that in several other places.


<p><br>
<a name="gamblers"> </a>
<li> <b>The Gambler's Fallacy</b><br>
Imagine that objects must obey the law of averages.
<p>
If you toss a coin and it has come down heads three times in a row,
you believe that it must come down tails the next time, because &quot;The Law of Averages&quot; dictates
that the coin has to even things out.
<p>
Wrong. The odds of the coin coming down heads again are still 50-50.
The coin has no memory. The coin does not remember how it came down the last several times, and
so choose to come down the other way the next time. The coin is just an inanimate piece of metal that spins
and comes down one way or another.
<p>
What people often misunderstand about &quot;The Law of Averages&quot; is that the Law of Averages only
explains history, it does not cause things to happen. That is, the Law of Averages says that
over the long haul, the dice will come up certain numbers certain percentages of times.
But the dice do not have to obey the Law of Averages. They do not have to roll a certain way
so as to satisfy the Law of Averages in the short term.
The Law of Averages just says that over the long haul, certain numbers tend to come up certain percentages
of times.

<p>
Similarly, the Law of Averages says that over the long run, a roulette wheel will tend to come up
red and black an even number of times. But the wheel does not have to produce an equal number of
reds and blacks in a short period of time. And if the wheel comes up red ten times in a row, a
gambler has no way of knowing that this run merely balances out a run of ten blacks that the wheel
did last week.
<p>
That brings up another interesting phenomenon: Brownian Motion. That is the motion observed in
a particle resting on the surface of the water. If you place a really tiny, almost microscopic particle
of something on the surface of water, it will jiggle around from being randomly struck by molecules of water
that are whizzing around in the liquid. (And the warmer the water is, the more and the faster
 the molecules whiz around.)
<p>
In theory, you would expect the particle to stay still. That is, because it is randomly hit by water
molecules coming from the left or right, front or back, the particle should
 just jiggle left and right, forwards and
back, and stay in the same place. At least, you would think it should, theoretically.
 But that isn't what happens. What really happens is
that the particle will get shoved around over long distances because the random strikes are not even.
For a while, it may get hit by more molecules from the left than the right, so it gets shoved to the right.
Then it gets hit from behind more than from in front, so it creeps forwards. 
 It will do a random walk that can cover
suprisingly large distances, and it may never return to its original position.
Someone who believes that the water molecules must obey the Law of Averages will watch in frustration
as the particle just wanders off in another direction, and never returns to its starting point, even
though the strikes from the left and right and front and back are &quot;supposed to even out&quot;.
<p>
There are some obvious easy exceptions to the &quot;Law of Averages&quot;. If a certain district has voted Republican
for the last 40 years, there is no reason to believe that they will suddenly vote Democratic, just
to even things out. And the solid Democratic district will not suddenly vote Republican just to even
things out. In those cases, the &quot;Law of Averages&quot; just does not apply. Other factors, like habit and
entrenched attitudes, determine the outcome.
So that brings up another logical fallacy: Mistaken Assumption of Randomness.


<p><br>
<a name="mistaken_randomness"> </a>
<li> <b>Mistaken Assumption of Randomness</b><br>
This fallacy is the mistake of assuming that things are random when they are not, and that the odds
are even when they are not.

<p>
As described in the example above, the outcome of elections in certain districts is anything but random,
and it would be a mistake to assume that Democrats and Republicans have an even chance in every district.
There are many non-random factors that determine outcomes, like tradition, custom, habit, ingrained beliefs
and preferences, culture, and even style and fashion.
<p>
There are many non-random things that determine why people do things, and it would be a big mistake
to assume that their behavior is random.

was okay for Frank Buchman to be a vicious hateful homophobic hypocrite.

<p>
A radio advertisement for vitamins says, &quot;Dr. Sawbones, a recognized authority on blah-blah...&quot;
Recognized by whom? What medical school or university or council of doctors recognized Dr. Sawbones as an
authority on anything?  
We got no actual evidence that Dr. Sawbones knows anything, just a passive-voice declaration that Dr. Sawbones
has been &quot;recognized&quot;.

<p>
Recently (2012.02.20), the FBI raided a house in Portland, Oregon, for cyber-crimes.
When the FBI wouldn't give the story to a TV news reporter (KOIN, Channel 6), he
declared, &quot;The FBI failed to give further information...&quot; Not,
&quot;the FBI chose to release no further details,&quot; or &quot;The FBI chose
to maintain case confidentiality for now,&quot; no, the FBI &quot;<b>failed</b> to
provide information.&quot; How's that for getting back at someone who won't give
you a juicy story?

<p>
When Princeton University President John Hibben banned Frank Buchman
and his organization from the Princeton campus for explicit sexual confessions and sensational
sexual revelations,
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#Howard_slanted" target="_blank">Hibben explained his actions</a>
to newspaper reporters in a press conference.
Peter Howard, a fanatical follower of Buchman, wrote of the event this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At Princeton, when the opposition appeared, the President, Dr. Hibben,
allowed himself to be quoted as saying that so long as he was President
there was no place for Dr. Buchman's work in the University.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Innocent Men</i>, Peter Howard, page 89.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
President Hibben did not passively &quot;allow himself to be quoted&quot; &#8212;
he deliberately, clearly declared his position in a public statement to the press.
<p>
Also notice the use of passive language, where some vague &quot;opposition&quot;
supposedly just mysteriously &quot;appeared&quot; from somewhere, rather than it being a case of
intelligent people strongly objecting to Frank Buchman's behavior and treatment
of students, and teaching bizarre occult theology, and all of the lurid talk about sex.
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#satisfying" target="_blank">Some of Buchman's critics commented</a>
that the sexual confessions at Oxford Group meetings were
&quot;as satisfying to the listeners as the original sin was to the confessors.&quot;

<b>DEBATING TECHNIQUES:</b>

<ul>

<p><br>
<a name="example"> </a>
<li> <b>Refute By Example</b><br>
This is a valid debating technique.
Find exceptions to the rule or generalization to prove it false.
If, for example, someone
declares that &quot;All ducks are white&quot;, you can answer,
&quot;No, that's wrong.
Think of Mallard ducks, or Ringnecks, or Harlequin Ducks, or Wood Ducks.
None of them are white.&quot;
<p>
Similarly, when A.A. people recite the line,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who
has thoroughly followed our path&quot;</font>,<br>
we can answer:<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;No, Bill Wilson was lying when he wrote that. Think about:
<ul>
<li>
the <i>Big Book</i> co-author
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_relapse" target="_blank">Henry Parkhurst</a>,
<li>
and the second A.A. woman
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#woman_stay" target="_blank">Florence Rankin</a>,
<li>
and the enthusiastic A.A. recruiters
<a href="orange-recruit.html#Jackie" target="_blank">Jackie</a> and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Paddy" target="_blank">Paddy</a>,
<li> and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Lillian_Roth" target="_blank">Lillian Roth</a>,
the famous childhood movie star and singer who founded
Alcoholics Anonymous in New Zealand, only to die drunk herself,
<li>
and Doctor Bob's son-in-law
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#autocrat_Bob" target="_blank">
Ernie Galbraith</a>, &quot;A.A. Number Four&quot;,
the constantly-relapsing older philanderer whom the autocratic Doctor
Robert Smith forced on his adopted daughter Sue Smith,
<li>
and then think about Bill's own recruiter
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">Ebby Thacher</a>,
who sucked Bill into the Oxford Group cult, only to relapse and
die drunk himself,
</ul>
&#8212; just to name the first half-dozen failures who come to mind.<br>
</font>
<p>
We can also say:
<p>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Lois Wilson's private secretary, Francis Hartigan, reported that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">more than
half of the authors</a> of the autobiographical stories
in the first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>
relapsed and returned to drinking, and Bill Wilson knew it, because he kept the first copy of
the <i>Big Book</i> that came off of the presses, in which he checked
off the names of the authors as they relapsed and left A.A..<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Dick B., the well-known A.A. historian,
reports that the entire New York group, the one run by Bill Wilson, had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank">a horrendous relapse rate</a>.<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;And in more modern times we have many scientific studies, including
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">those
by Prof. George Vaillant of Harvard University</a>,
who is a member of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., which reveal that
A.A. has a terrible failure rate &#8212; basically, 100% &#8212; and an
'appalling' death rate to go with it.&quot;
</font>
<p>
What Bill Wilson really should have written is:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person <font color="blue"><i>succeed</i></font> who
has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;</font>

<p><br>
<a name="contradiction"> </a>
<li> <b>Refute By Exposing Contradiction</b><br>
This is another valid debating technique.
Show that a statement is false or at least unreliable by exposing a contradiction
with other statements or facts.
<p>
For example, Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that 75 percent of the
newcomers to A.A. got sobered up:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Of alcoholics who
came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, in the Foreword to the Second Edition of
&quot;The Big Book&quot;, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, page XX, 1955.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


But
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson contradicted himself
many times</a>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
At a memorial service for Dr. Bob, Bill Wilson actually bragged
about the pathetically low success rate of the whole A.A. program. (Bill was making
himself out to be a long-suffering hero, working tirelessly to promote Alcoholics
Anonymous.)
Bill described the early days of A.A. this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>

Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;
file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li> When he wrote his history of Alcoholics Anonymous in 1957,
Bill Wilson admitted that the early A.A. program had been a disaster:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
And Nell Wing, a secretary of Alcoholics Anonymous for 35 years, and Bill Wilson's
personal secretary for many of those years, as well as A.A.'s first archivist,
reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;There were alcoholics in the hospitals of whom A.A. could touch and help
only about five percent. The doctors started giving them
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#LSD_therapy" target="_blank">a dose of LSD</a>,
so that the resistance would be broken down. And they had about
fifteen percent recoveries.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 370.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(It would appear that LSD is three times as effective as Alcoholics Anonymous
for treating alcoholism. Unfortunately,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#LSD_Toronto" target="_blank">that doesn't work either</a>,
in the long run.
</font>
</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="minimize"> </a>
<a name="Abu_Ghraib3"> </a>
<li> <b>Minimization and Denial</b><br>
Go into denial and refuse to face the truth, or admit the truth. Believe in fantasies or fairy tales
rather than the facts. Try to minimize undesired facts.
<p>
Minimization and denial is a kind of dishonesty.
Criminals often use it to try to explain away the seriousness of their crimes:
&quot;That's no big deal. It's nothing new. Doesn't everybody do that?&quot;
<p>
<i>Minimization and Denial</i> is the technique that a lot of alcoholics
and cigarette smokers use to declare that
they don't really need to quit drinking or smoking &#8212;
they minimize the seriousness of their problem &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank"><i>Maybe I'm over-doing it
a little bit right now, but frankly I'm not ready to quit just yet</i></a>&quot; &#8212;
or they deny that they even have a problem &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Problem? What problem? I can quit any time I want.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
Another name for denial is &quot;The Ostrich Syndrome&quot; &#8212; that behavior where someone
just sticks his head into the sand and refuses to see the problem.
&#8212; And where someone just refuses to see and
to take responsibility for a situation. The ultimate personification of
such mental midgetry was Sgt. Schultz, the immortal bumbler of TV's
&quot;Hogan's Heroes&quot;: &quot;I know nothing! I see nothing! NOTHING!&quot;

<p>
For example, Alcoholics Anonymous claims that you can have &quot;any God of your understanding&quot;, and A.A.
members brag and joke about worshipping a doorknob, a rock, a mountain or a motorcycle, and some even
use a cat or a parakeet as their &quot;god&quot;.  When this was mentioned in a discussion, an A.A. defender
replied:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I would never pray to a doorknob and I never got that other than it simply
means something other than yourself. I rather suspect that got started as a tongue
in cheek reference.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is denial.

<p>
A variation on the <i>Denial</i> is the line, &quot;There is no evidence...&quot;
&#8212; just denying and ignoring all unwanted evidence &#8212; as in,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;There is no
evidence that eating genetically-modified food crops causes health problems.&quot;</i></font>
Oh yes there is.
The safety assurance studies submitted to show the safety of GMOs actually suggest
hepatobiliary and renal toxicity:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161130003614/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=hammond+safety+assurance" target="_blank">
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=hammond+safety+assurance</a>

<br>
And an additional strategy is to prevent any undesired evidence from coming into existence,
like how Monsanto refuses to allow research to be conducted on their patented genetically-modified
crops, to see whether they are really harmful to wildlife, honeybees, livestock or humans.

<p>
Cults use this technique a lot, to explain away their every fault and flaw.
Occasionally, they will even mention that their &quot;enemies&quot; have
accused them of being a cult, and laugh and explain,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just that some of our recruiters have been really enthusiastic
about getting new people to come to meetings. That's all there is to it.&quot;
</font>
(That is the rap I heard in Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, which really is a cult.)

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
When cult members, or
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#True_Believer" target="_blank"><i>true believers</i></a>
in any cause, for that matter, are confronted with
information that is contrary to their beliefs, they go through a predictable
set of reactions:
<ol>
<p>
<li> <b>Denial</b>. They will deny that the information is true, and reject it:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;That can't possibly be true.
No, I don't believe that.
Where did you hear that?&quot;
</font>
<p>
Arianna Huffington described a fanatic as someone who simply rejects and
disregards all information that conflicts with his chosen beliefs.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If you give them enough supporting evidence to make denial impossible,
then they will progress to stage 2:
<p>
<li> <b>Minimization and rationalization</b>.
They will minimize the importance of the information, and
claim that it doesn't matter, or just try to
<a href="#rationalize">rationalize</a> it all away:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
That's just a trivial detail.
Don't most religious leaders do that?
Churches, schools, corporations, everything is a cult, so it doesn't matter.

all of the drugs, and then all of the boys &#8212;

</font>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If you present them with convincing
information that it really is an important point, and does matter,
then they will progress to stage 3:
<p>
<li> <b>Blanking</b>. True Believers will just blank their minds, and turn off,
and refuse to hear anything more that you say. Sometimes they will even physically
leave, walking or running away, to avoid hearing anything more.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Jon Atack described how blanking is taught to Scientologists:
<font color="blue">
'If the criticism cannot be silenced, then the scientologist should cease
all communication with the critic, or
&quot;disconnect&quot;.'</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt19">19</a></sup></font>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Alternatively, if they don't blank out, then they will experience a
change in viewpoint where they begin to see things from your viewpoint.
They will suddenly wake up and &quot;see the light.&quot; Whether
they will blank out or change their minds depends on their
willingness to change their opinions and beliefs, and willingness to accept the truth.<br>
(The fanatic says,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I won't allow my opinions to be swayed by mere facts.&quot;</i></font>)
</ol>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Notice how when cults and other dogmatic organizations teach blanking to their members,
they diguise it as a self-defense technique:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Those critics are trying to hurt you (by telling you the truth).<br>
They are trying to make you lose faith (in the leader or the cult).<br>
Don't let them do it to you.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Amway teaches its soap distributors that their worst enemies are their friends and family
members who try to talk a little common sense into them:<br>

&quot;Don't let them steal your dreams.&quot;

<p>
There are a zillion flavors of minimization and denial.
<ul>
<p>
<li> Dismiss undesired information as trivial nit-picking. For example, when people point out
the flaws of a program or design, a defender of that program or design may answer:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Isn't all of that comparison and scrutiny with a magnification glass going much too far for this forum?&quot;
</font>

<p><li>
Dismiss information as unimportant.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;That's old hat. Everybody knows that. It doesn't matter.&quot;
</font>

<p><li>
When someone complained about black dots and artifacts that a digital camera inserted into his pictures,
a defender of the camera posted:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Make a print and tell us how much of a problem it is.&quot;
</font>
That is minimizing and denying the problem.
Making prints on paper is not the ultimate goal of all photography. Just because a cheap low-resolution
printer will mask defects in images does not make those defects okay.

<p><li>
When members of a group or organization behave abominably, defenders of the group
will argue that the problem is &quot;just a few bad apples&quot;.

Politicians and pundits for political parties often use variations of the
<i>minimization and denial</i> technique:
<ul>
<font color="#4f007f">
<li>
&quot;Oh heck, all politicians lie and deceive. It just comes with the territory.
It's part of the job. You just have to do it. It's no big deal.&quot;<br>
<li>
&quot;Oh heck, all politicians take bribes and gifts and agree to vote
a certain way in trade for money. It's called 'campaign contributions'.
You have to do it, or you won't get re-elected. It's no big deal.&quot;

</ul>

<p>
Rush Limbaugh gave us a great example of <i>minimization and denial</i> in trying
to dismiss the torture and murder of prisoners at <i>Abu Ghraib</i>
prison as a trivial matter &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It was just like a college fraternity prank. ... You ever heard of emotional
release? You ever heard of the need to blow off some steam? ... Who died?&quot;<br>
</font>
(Actually, several prisoners died from overdose of torture, and the Pentagon reported
that two more were deliberately murdered.)
<p>
Rush Limbaugh also used minimization and denial to explain away his own
addiction to pain-killers, after recommending the death sentence for junkies:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I'm not like a junkie. I only took legal prescription pain-killers.&quot;</font><br>
</blockquote>
Yes, but Limbaugh didn't have a prescription for all of those drugs, so the drugs weren't legal.
And they were bought
on the black market, just the same as how every other junkie gets his illegal drugs.

During the U.S. Senate Hearings on the <i>Abu Ghraib</i> torture and
abuse (2004.05.11), the <i>Al-Jazeera</i> news network showed a video tape of hooded
men executing an American prisoner &#8212; Nicholas Berg &#8212; by chopping off
his head with a big knife.
The killers declared that the execution was done in retaliation for the
torture and killing of prisoners in <i>Abu Ghraib</i>.<br>
A Republican Senator responded
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I don't believe this happened in a 'one-for-one'. That kind of stuff
happens anyway.&quot;</font><br>
The Senator ignored the simple fact that such a ceremonial execution of an American
prisoner had never happened in Iraq before. The Iraqis even hospitalized Jessica Lynch
until she was rescued, remember?
<p>
<font color="blue">
UPDATE: 2004.06.18 &#8212; Now the Al Queda terrorists in Saudi Arabia have
announced that the Americans whom they kidnap will be treated in the
same manner as the prisoners in <i>Abu Ghraib</i> prison...

<p>
Meanwhile, the Washington weasles had a truckload of minimization and denial and rationalizations
to offer us:
<p>
<ul>
<li> It wasn't really torture. It wasn't that bad. It was just some forceful interrogation.
<li> It was justified.
<li> It was necessary to get intelligence.
<li> They are the bad guys. It's okay to do it to them.
<li> It wasn't anything like the other side's beheadings.

now, and that the Geneva Convention is &quot;quaint&quot; and obsolete.
We used to consider countries that tortured prisoners of war to be
barbarians, and declare that
they needed to learn some Christian morals. Now it's the so-called
&quot;Christians&quot; who are doing it.

In March of 2006, a videotape came out that clearly showed White House officials
receiving emphatic warnings that Hurricane Katrina could and would top the levees
and flood New Orleans and cause a major disaster
&#8212; warnings that the Bush Administration blithely ignored. G. W. Bush went on vacation,
and went to a birthday party in Arizona where he pretended to play a guitar.<br>
A White House spokesman responded to the tape by saying,

During a debate on the PBS News Hour with Jim Lehrer, about the firing
of Mary McCarthy for revealing the existence of secret CIA prisons in
foreign countries, to which people were &quot;disappeared&quot; &#8212;
secretly kidnapped, renditioned, and tortured, which is several war crimes
&#8212; one Republican talking head, Richard Kerr, a former CIA deputy director,
declared:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, first of all, I'm not absolutely sure that I agree with the
idea that these are crimes, an international crime.&quot;</font>

So, kidnapping people who might be innocent, and imprisoning them without a trial,
and torturing them, even torturing them to death, is not a crime under the Bush administration?
When did we rewrite those laws?

<p><br>
Declaring that &quot;it's over, and nobody cares&quot; is another kind of minimization.
Politicians use this one whenever they can get away with it, to try to stop
debate on a touchy subject. For example, when the American people discovered that
George Bush had lied about the extent of warrantless surveillance of Americans
that was going on &#8212; that the NSA was even collecting information about millions
of phone calls made purely within the USA and between loyal Americans, not involving Al Quada,
even while huge class-action lawsuits were being filed against the phone companies who gave out the
phone records without a court warrant, the Republican talking heads went on the
political talk shows Friday night on PBS (2006.05.12) and declared that &quot;It's over.
The furor has died down. It's all a big nothing. The American people don't care.&quot;

sexually explicit homosexually invitational emails to very young male Congressional pages &#8212;
messages that one page described as &quot;Sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, ... (for 13 'sicks') &#8212;

the resignations of those Republican leaders who knew what was going on because the under-age
pages reported it to them, but the Republican leaders just convered it all up and allowed Foley to continue
that behavior.
<p>
And, using the minimization tactic some more, the Republican leaders are now
describing Rep. Foley's predatory homosexual emails

Another kind of denial is <i>depersonalization</i> &#8212; personally detaching

nothing to do with you, or isn't really your responsibility.

A.A. defenders use the <i>minimization and denial</i> technique a lot
to explain that A.A. doesn't really have
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">a dishonesty problem</a>,
and doesn't really need to get off it and start telling the truth.
And A.A. doesn't really have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">a humongous failure rate</a>.
And A.A. isn't really
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">a cult religion</a>.
<p>
Likewise, A.A. true believers attempt to dismiss the A.A. 95% drop-out rate in just the first year
as &quot;the myth of the 5% retention rate&quot;, as if the drop-out rate had been somehow disproven
and wasn't real. (It's real.)

In a debate, you can use the <i>Minimization and Denial</i>

Whenever your opponent says something that you don't like, or

just reply with one of these standard answers:<br>

<ul>
<p><li> &quot;It's unimportant because it happened so long ago.&quot;
<p><li> &quot;People have been criticizing AA forever; what's new there?&quot;
<p><li> &quot;Just because you found a hundred groups where
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">sponsors
sexually harass the new pretty women members</a> doesn't mean that it
is a universal characteristic of A.A., or that
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">it happens everywhere</a>,
or that you can fault all of A.A. for it. You can't generalize like
that. No group has any control over any other group.&quot;

<p><li> &quot;Each A.A. meeting is a little different. Look around and you'll find one that suits you...&quot;

<p><li> &quot;What appears to be a contradiction is just a paradox, just a wonderful paradox.&quot;
<p><li> &quot;I suspect that the whole story is a hoax made up by the anti-A.A. people, just to discredit A.A..&quot;

<p><li> &quot;But the A.A. program is free. Where else can you find such

<li> <b>Instant Denial</b><br>
A variation on the denial technique is <i>Instant Denial</i>: Say something, and then
immediately deny that you said it.
<p>
Peter Howard,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9" target="_blank">the fascist disciple</a>
of Frank Buchman who assumed the leadership of the Oxford Groups/MRA
organization after Buchman's death, attacked Frank Buchman's critics
with these words:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century School book">
...Christians forget that Christ was crucified not because he was wrong
but because He was right. There was one of Christ's contemporaries who,
while agreeing that the work being done was good, always disagreed with
the methods and thought he could do things better. He was critical of
the way money was spent, critical of the company Christ kept, critical of
his comrades. His name was Judas.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This is not to suggest that Buchman was like Christ or that all his critics
are like Judas....<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Britain and the Beast</i>, Peter Howard, 1963, page 106.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Peter Howard clearly suggested that Frank Buchman's critics were acting just like Judas,
and then Howard immediately denied it, and declared that he wasn't suggesting it.
Howard also implied that Frank Buchman was right, just like Jesus was, and then Howard
denied that too.

<p>
People who are promoting Alcoholics Anonymous use the same <i>Instant Denial</i>
technique, too. Here, the speaker denies it before he says it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century School book">
&quot;This is not a commercial for A.A. Frankly, A.A. is not for everybody.
But A.A. saved my life, and only through A.A. was I able to learn how to
survive my disease.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So <i>it is</i> a commercial for A.A., and A.A. <i>is</i> the only way after all.<br>
(And the speaker was also <a href="#assume">assuming a couple of major premises</a>
&#8212; that alcoholism is a disease, rather than behavior, and that A.A.
has a working cure for that disease, rather
than
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">a horrendous failure rate</a>.)
<p>
A variation on this <i>Instant Denial</i> technique is to say something and then immediately
declare that you didn't mean it.
<p>
Another variation is the one that you see lawyers using in TV shows all of the time: A clever lawyer
asks an
improper question, and then immediately withdraws it. A lawyer will attack a witness with a question like,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Isn't it true that you hated your husband and wanted him dead?&quot;<br>
</font>
The opposing attorney will scream,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Objection, your Honor!&quot;<br>
</font>
And the first lawyer answers,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I withdraw the question, your Honor.&quot;<br>
</font>
Even if the judge says,
<font color="green">
&quot;Let that question be stricken from the record. The jury will disregard the question.&quot;</font>,
the harm has already been done.

<li> &quot;Now look at the real facts here...&quot;
</ul>
</font>
When used in response to a question, all of them mean,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I'm not going to answer your question. I'm changing the subject and
diverting attention and won't even talk about your question.&quot;
</font>


<p>
A good one that I heard on Al Franken's radio show (20 April 2004) was:
A ditto-head was claiming that rich Democrats do not really care about
the poor. When asked for proof of that statement, he answered,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, let's look at the results of their programs.&quot;</font><br>
<i>Whoops!</i> Stop right there. That's a different issue. That is changing the subject.
The effectiveness of any help-the-poor program does not prove or
disprove how much someone <i>cares</i> about the poor.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now one could claim that an ineffective program shows that someone was
inept or incompetent at designing or administering programs, but that
is a very different issue.
That does not prove how much someone cares or doesn't care.
<p>
And such an accusation may be groundless
because it completely ignores issues like funding. Was the program
really ineffective or badly designed or poorly managed,
or was it just grossly underfunded by the
Republican Congress that even cut Veteran's benefits and closed
V.A. hospitals while it sent the troops off to war in Iraq?

<a name="Abu_Ghraib2"> </a>
The U.S. Senate hearings on the torture of prisoners at <i>Abu Ghraib</i> prison
(2004.05.11) provide us with another example of misdirection of attention:
Instead of talking about the horrors that the pictures showed, one Republican
Senator went off on a tangent complaining about how the pictures had been taken improperly
by a soldier who had no authority to do so &#8212; he had used his own privately-owned
digital camera, and had no orders from his superiors to take the pictures,
so his taking of the pictures violated the military regulations regarding
how military prisons were to be operated....<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Never mind the fact that torturing, raping, and murdering prisoners
was also against those same military regulations....<br>
(And that political stunt is also an obvious attempt to
&quot;<a href="#ad_hominem">Kill the Messenger</a>&quot;
&#8212; just attack the whistle-blower who dared to document the illegal abuses.)</i><br>
</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Ah politics, isn't it wonderful?</i>
</font>

<p>
Not to be outdone, another Republican Senator started waxing eloquent about
what a great job our soldiers are doing, and how we shouldn't distract our men,
or the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, from
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the more important job of defending America from terrorism.&quot;</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Right. Stopping the practice of war crimes is just an annoying little distraction
keeping us from doing what is really important.
Our efforts to stop terrorism won't be undermined by the entire
Arab and Moslem world seeing us as a bunch of vicious, racist, religious-bigot Nazis
who torture innocent men and women; no, not at all....</i><br>
</font>


<p><br>
Over in the A.A. arena, one of Bill Wilson's standard stunts was, when someone like
<a href="orange-Henrietta_Seiberling.html" target="_blank">Clarence Snyder</a>
would
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html" target="_blank">criticize Wilson</a>
for
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">massive fraud</a> and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">felonious dishonesty</a>,
Wilson would reply with something like,
&quot;My, how those alcoholics love to squabble and argue.
Being the
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#argumentative_lot" target="_blank">
argumentative lot</a> that they are, they just love to
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#wrestle_authority" target="_blank">
challenge authority</a>.&quot;

<p>
<a name="ftnt18_ret"> </a>
Doctor Bob also gave us a great example of diverting attention,
back in the early days of the Oxford Group, before Alcoholics Anonymous got started.
Henrietta Seiberling was trying to get Doctor Bob to quit drinking.
She said that she had received
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">Guidance</a>&quot;</i>
that &quot;Bob must not touch one drop of alcohol&quot;, and
she told Doctor Bob about it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He answered, &quot;Henrietta, I don't understand this thing [alcoholism].
<i>Nobody</i> understands
it.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt18">18</a></sup></font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Doctor Bob changed the subject from &quot;not drinking alcohol&quot;
to something abstract and inconsequential like
&quot;understanding alcoholism&quot;,
because he didn't want to talk
about <i>actually really quitting drinking</i>.
He also tried to imply that
because &quot;nobody understood alcoholism&quot;,
it wasn't possible to quit drinking, so there was no sense in
even wasting any time trying.  Cute avoidance technique, huh?
</font>

<p>
Similarly, if a critic of A.A. says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
&quot;An awful lot of state and federal courts have now ruled that
Alcoholics Anonymous is a religious organization, or engages in
religious activities, as defined by Constitutional law.
The most interesting one happened just a few months ago, when
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#confessional" target="_blank">a judge threw out a murder
conviction</a>
because the killer confessed to the murder in an A.A. meeting, and
one of the other members reported it to the police.
The judge ruled that <i>'sharing'</i> in an A.A. meeting is a form
of protected confession in a religious ceremony, just like confessing
your sins to the priest in a Catholic Church.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
a Stepper can divert attention by answering:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I don't think that is an appropriate subject of discussion in
this context. We don't get involved in outside issues.
I was just getting to how to use the Seventh Step to cure
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#security_society" target="_blank">people's instincts
for security and society</a>. Let's concentrate on that.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
Or:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It isn't fair of you to attack A.A. when no one can
answer, because nobody speaks for A.A.. Go pick on somebody who
can fight back.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
If someone starts talking about
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">
the corruption and dishonesty at the A.A. headquarters</a>,
a Stepper can change the subject by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, that's a different issue. Let's not get into that now.
Let's just read page 49 of the <i>Big Book</i> and talk about that.&quot;
</font>


<p>
And don't forget obfuscation. That is also an effective way to
divert attention, by confusing and clouding an issue, and muddying the
waters so thoroughly that you can't even see it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The judge was completely off base, and his judgement was
totally wrong, because there are no priests in Alcoholics Anonymous.
I mean, who's the priest in a meeting, and who are you confessing
your sins to?&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That bogus argument ignores the obvious fact that you can confess
something to someone besides an ordained priest.
(Just ask any criminal who ever confessed something to the police.)
And you can have
a religious ceremony without a priest. Lots of churches, like the
Quakers, for instance, don't have any ordained clergy.
Everybody in the church is free to speak when the spirit moves
him.

<p><br>
You can also divert attention with slogans. A.A. does that a lot.
If someone is asking pointed, critical questions about the illogical parts
of the A.A. program, trying to understand how the whole thing is supposed to
work, the old-timers answer:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li> &quot;Utilize, Don't Analyze.&quot;
<li> &quot;Stop Your Stinkin' Thinkin'.&quot;
<li> &quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;
<li> &quot;You know, sometimes you can be too smart for your own good.&quot;
<li> &quot;You don't have to understand how electricity works in order to use it.&quot;
<li> &quot;Nobody is too stupid to get the program, but some people are too intelligent.&quot;
</ul>
</font>
<p>
All of those slogans are designed to keep newcomers from thinking, and discovering how
flawed, crazy, illogical and irrational the A.A. program really is.

<p><br>
<a name="diversion_angry"> </a>
Another common A.A. diversion is to accuse the speaker of being angry.
A.A. true believers actually think that someone is automatically wrong if
he is at all angry,
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#no_anger" target="_blank">no matter how outrageous
the sins or crimes that have angered the speaker</a>,

anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't we entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly

We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those better qualified
to handle it.

So the point of the discussion gets lost in an argument about

Alcoholics Anonymous uses this trick often. If someone criticizes A.A. for
failing to sober us alcoholics, A.A. members cite the large sales figures
for the A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, and claim that those numbers prove that A.A.
is a big success.
<p>
Likewise, they also cite the membership numbers &#8212; a claimed 2 million &#8212; as proof
that A.A. works.
They supply no evidence to show what percentage of those members are sober, or newcomers,
or repeat relapsers, or insane...

<p><br>
<a name="accomplishments_sidestep"> </a>
<li> <b>The Positive Accomplishments Sidestep</b><br>
This is a kind of diversion tactic.
When criticized, avoid the point and change the subject by citing some positive accomplishments.
<p>
When George W. Bush is criticized for his failures in war, like,
&quot;You didn't catch Osama bin Laden, and you didn't
find any Weapons of Mass Destruction, and Iraq is degenerating into civil war!&quot;, he answers:
<ol>
<li> &quot;But we got rid of the Taliban.&quot;
<li> &quot;But we established democracy.&quot;
<li> &quot;But we got rid of a dictator.&quot;
<li> &quot;But we established freedom. Freedom is on the march.&quot;
</ol>


<p><br>
<a name="declare_victory"> </a>
<li> <b>Declare Victory</b><br>
When facing criticism, like for incompetence and failure, just suddenly, arbitrarily declare victory.
Another name for this behavior is &quot;triumphalism&quot;.
<p>
For instance, on December 10, 2008, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson had to explain to the Congressional
Oversight Panel how TARP had been implemented, and what had been accomplished with the $350,000,000,000
that had been allocated so far.  Never mind the facts that unemployment was still going up &#8212; a lot
 &#8212; and
nationwide, the economic conditions were worsening &#8212; a lot.
And middle-class homes were still being foreclosed on &#8212; a lot.
Paulson just declared victory and announced that things were <i>much</i> better because the
TED spread was smaller.
<p>
The TED spread is the difference between the interest rate on the 3-month
U.S. Treasury bills and on the 3-month &quot;LIBOR&quot; &#8212; the interest rate that commercial banks charge
for lending each other money in Europe.  It is basically a measure of how nervous the big financial
players are about lending each other money.  So, because Americans weren't much more nervous than
Europeans this month, Paulson declared victory and implied that we had
gotten good results from our $350 billion worth of bailout to Wall Street banks and gamblers.


<p><br>
<a name="red_herring"> </a>
<li> <b>Red Herring</b><br>
A <i>Red Herring Fallacy</i> is a distraction technique where you talk about one subject
 and then immediatly blame an unrelated topic or group as a cause or correlation to it.
<p>

Another explanation of the <i>Red Herring</i> is:
A Red Herring is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in
order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to
&quot;win&quot; an argument by leading attention away from the argument
and to another topic. This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; has the
following form:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Topic A is under discussion.
<li>
Topic B is introduced under the guise of being relevant to topic A (when topic B is actually not relevant to topic A).
<li>
Topic A is abandoned.
</ol>
<p>

This sort of &quot;reasoning&quot; is fallacious because merely changing
the topic of discussion hardly counts as an argument against a claim.
<p>

Examples of Red Herring:
<ol>
<p><li>
&quot;Teachers shouldn't make students wear school uniforms. The Nazis made children wear uniforms too!&quot;
<p><li>
&quot;We admit that this measure is popular. But we also urge you to
note that there are so many bond issues on this ballot that the whole
thing is getting ridiculous.&quot;

<p><li>
&quot;Argument&quot; for a tax cut:<br>
&quot;You know, I've begun to think that there is some merit in the
Republican's tax cut plan. I suggest that you come up with something
like it, because if we Democrats are going to survive as a party, we
have got to show that we are as tough-minded as the Republicans, since
that is what the public wants.&quot;


<p><li>
&quot;Argument&quot; for making grad school requirements stricter:<br>
&quot;I think there is great merit in making the requirements stricter
for the graduate students. I recommend that you support it, too. After
all, we are in a budget crisis and we do not want our salaries affected.&quot;
</ol>
<p>
(<i>Thanks to &quot;Dr. Herring&quot; for that one.</i>)


<p><br>
<a name="personal_loyalty"> </a>
<li> <b>The Personal Loyalty Red Herring</b><br>
This is another kind of diversion tactic.
Change the issue into a test of loyalty.
When George Bush is criticized, he declares,
<ol>
<li>
&quot;You're either with us or you're against us.&quot;
<li>
&quot;Who are you going to side with, the patriotic Americans, or the terrorists?&quot;
</ol>

<p>
A variation on this tactic is demanding promises of loyalty from others as a way of
manipulating them.
When the future Nazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels married
his sweetheart Magda, Adolf Hitler said,
&quot;I wish you a lifetime of happiness and hope you will remain my good friend.&quot;
It was supposed to be Goebbels' day of happiness, but Hitler managed to turn it around and
make it about himself.
<p>
(Goebbels replied that he would remain Hitler's friend, and that Magda would help him
keep that promise. Goebbels did keep it too, right up to the minute in the bunker in Berlin
when he killed his wife and children and then committed suicide at the same time as Hitler
and Eva Braun did.)


<p><br>
<a name="story_sourcing"> </a>
<li> <b>The Story Sourcing Distraction</b><br>
This is yet another kind of diversion tactic.
Instead of answering cricism, attack the source of the information:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Bush declared: &quot;Who leaked that? We are going to find those
leakers and take care of them.&quot;
(Ignore the fact that George Bush and his staff turned out to be the leakers.)
<li> &quot;You read that in the liberal media?&quot;
<li> &quot;This is Washington. People say all kinds of things.&quot;
<li> &quot;That's the kind of language you might expect to hear from the sovereign
leader of an Arab country.&quot; &#8212; That was Joshua Bolten, the White House Chief of Staff,
explaining why the Prime Minister of Lebanon objected to Israel bombing his country.

<a name="ret_generals"> </a>
When six retired U.S. generals criticized Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld

the White House shills complained that it was &quot;inappropriate&quot; for retired generals

trying to imply that the criticism was somehow invalid because it came from retired generals
&#8212; and that they were too late, anyway.
Oh really?
<p>
So when <i>is</i> it appropriate for generals to raise objections and
condemn politicians' stupidity?<br>
<ul>
<li> While they are still in uniform?
(Thus violating the sacred American principle that the U.S. military always obeys
civilian authority so that we don't degenerate into a banana republic that is run by a
murdering Colonel Manuel Norriega or General Augusto Pinochet?) General McArthur was fired by
President Truman for criticizing the President and his policies while still serving in uniform.

Bill Wilson used this stunt like this:<br>
When they wrote the opening chapters of the &quot;Big Book&quot;
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Henry Parkhurst and Bill Wilson were partners.
But Wilson refused to give Parkhurst fair credit for
what he wrote, and eventually cheated Parkhurst out of everything.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_relapse" target="_blank">Disillusioned and disappointed
 at the betrayal, Parkhurst relapsed</a>.
<p>
When Henry Parkhurst came around drunk and begging for money, asking to be paid for
some furniture that he had left in the office, Wilson talked him out of his shares
in the publishing company that would publish the <i>Big Book</i> &#8212;
shares that would have eventually made Parkhurst a moderately wealthy man.
Wilson also denied Parkhurst any share in the royalties from the <i>Big Book</i>,
using the excuse that Parkhurst had returned to drinking.
<p>
And Wilson didn't try to save his friend's life. Henry Parkhurst was the friend
that Bill and Lois turned to when they were homeless because the bank foreclosed
on their 182 Clinton Street house. Henry was their friend then, and Bill and Lois
moved in with Parkhurst.  But when Parkhurst needed some friendship and
help in return, Wilson robbed Parkhurst and then left him to die drunk and pennyless, alone.
Which he did.

<p>
Then Wilson complained about how hard it was to take, that Parkhurst was gone.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...At length he broke down completely and went on a terrific bender after
four years of sobriety. He never again showed any real sign of recovery,

had revealed her Lesbian sexual orientation to the whole world in the press and
on radio and TV.
<p>
Liz Cheney and her mother both immediately went on TV and complained that they
were &quot;so offended&quot; that John Kerry would say such a thing.

When asked an embarassing question, answer a different question.

This technique is closely related to the previous item &quot;creating a diversion&quot;,
but it has twists of its own.
Politicians routinely use this trick to avoid answering the tough questions.
Really skilled politicians actually use this technique to turn hard
questions to their advantage &#8212;
they will answer the question that they really wish had been asked, so that they can
go on and on about how great their accomplishments have been lately.

<a name="intimate_Himmler"> </a>
For example: The Oxford Group cult leader Frank Buchman attracted a lot of attention
and criticism back in the nineteen-thirties
for associating with high-ranking Nazis like
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Himmler1" target="_blank">the Gestapo chief Heinrich Himmler</a>.
Buchman's faithful follower and apologist Peter Howard wrote that Buchman
never met Hitler
(<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_not_changed" target="_blank">which was
probably untrue</a>), and then added:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Nor was Buchman an intimate of Himmler or of any other member of the Nazi
hierarchy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Mystery of Moral Re-Armament; A Study of
Frank Buchman and His Movement</i>, Tom Driberg, 1965, page 66.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nobody was asking whether Frank Buchman and Heinrich Himmler got in bed together; they were
asking how sympathetic Frank Buchman was to the Nazi philosophy and goals.
But Peter Howard didn't want to talk about that, so he just declared that
Buchman and Himmler were not &quot;intimate&quot;.

<p>
Peter Howard used this technique after World War II when he triumphantly
produced a letter from the Secretary of the U.S. Air Force that declared
that the Moral Re-Armament organization (the renamed Oxford Group) was
not a bunch of pacifists.
Nobody had accused MRA of being pacifists. (Not ever, that I know of.)
They were accused of being fascists,
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#Nazi_like" target="_blank">Nazi-like</a>,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">Nazi-sympathizers</a>,
<a href="orange-rroot420.html" target="_blank">draft dodgers</a>,
and
<a href="orange-rroot390.html" target="_blank">chicken-hawk &quot;super-patriots&quot;</a>,
but not pacifists.
Peter Howard's &quot;proof&quot; that MRA was not pacifistic did not prove that
MRA was not fascistic in nature, or that they weren't chicken-hawk draft-dodgers
or Nazi sympathizers.

<p>
For another example, at a press conference,
when George W. Bush was asked about the torture of prisoners
in <i>Abu Ghraib</i> prison, Bush answered the question by talking about
how wonderful freedom is, and how &quot;we&quot; are bringing freedom to the people of Iraq,
and how just a small minority of the Iraqi people hated freedom...
That's changing the subject and answering a different question.

On <i>Meet The Press</i>, Sunday, December 21, 2003,
Representative Tom Delay (R-TX) was asked about General Wesley
Clark's statement that he would have persisted in hunting for Osama bin Laden, rather
than get distracted chasing Saddam Hussein [who did not attack the U.S.A.
on September 11),
and that he, Clark, would have gotten Osama by now if he had been in charge.

Tom Delay's answer:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Whether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the
alcoholic member has to if he would recover. The others
must be convinced of his new status beyond the shadow of a
doubt. Seeing is believing to most families who have lived
with a drinker.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here is a case in point:
One of our friends is a heavy smoker and coffee
drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged. Seeing this, and meaning to be
helpful, his wife commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he was
overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not ready to stop. His
wife is one of those persons who really feels there is something rather sinful
about these commodities, so she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw
him into a fit of anger. He got drunk.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of course our friend was wrong &#8212; dead wrong. He had to painfully
admit that and mend his spiritual fences.
Though he is now a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous,
he still smokes and drinks coffee, but neither his wife nor
anyone else stands in judgement. She sees she was wrong
to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more
serious ailments were being rapidly cured.<br></font>

Oh? Somebody can continue doing whatever
he is doing just because he <i>frankly</i> says that he isn't ready to stop?<br>
<ul>
<li> When was the last time that you heard an A.A. member
accept that as a good excuse for someone to continue drinking?
Can the alcoholic say, &quot;I know I'm over-doing it
right now, but <i>frankly</i>, I'm not ready to stop just yet&quot;,
and keep right on drinking forever?<br>

<li> If you catch someone robbing your house, can the burglar say,
&quot;I know I'm over-doing it right now, but <i>frankly</i>, I'm not ready

<li> And, if the guy next door has a bad habit of molesting

Logically, there is not any connection between molesting little girls
and smoking cigarettes, or between smoking and robbing houses, but
there doesn't need to be.
The point is to exaggerate the <i>&quot;Frankly, I'm not ready to

His clean and sober wife, on the other

that you get away from by going to an A.A. meeting...

<p>

Likewise, Bill wrote that &quot;her intolerance finally threw him

Wanting your husband to live and be healthy is &quot;intolerance&quot;?<br>
Was she also &quot;intolerant&quot; when she wanted him to quit

<p>
<li>

Bill Wilson's goal
was to promote a feeling of &quot;us good old boys versus the nagging
wives&quot;, which is
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#jealous" target="_blank">just one of Bill's
many attacks on his
wife</a>.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>

And it's also an example of the creation
of a &quot;<a href="#granfalloon">granfalloon</a>&quot;,
a distinguishing characteristic that will define and unite a group.

<p>
And also note the use of yet another propaganda technique:
<i>&quot;<a href="#assume">Assume The Major Premise</a>.&quot;</i>

Look at this sentence:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;She sees she was wrong
to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more
serious ailments were being rapidly cured.&quot;<br></font>

Wilson actually managed to do it twice, and pack two lies into
one sentence:
<ol>
<li> She was wrong to try to get him to quit smoking.
<li> His more serious ailments were being rapidly cured.
</ol>
<p>
First off, she wasn't wrong. Bill Wilson was just a hard-core chain smoker
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#no_quit" target="_blank">who didn't ever quit smoking,
not even when he had burned out his lungs and gotten fatal emphysema</a>,
and he hated his wife Lois nagging him, so he
said that she was wrong to try to get him to quit smoking. (For that matter,
Bill also said that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#dont_nag" target="_blank">his wife Lois was wrong
to nag him to quit drinking</a>.)
<p>
Then, what &quot;more serious ailments were being rapidly cured&quot;?
His alcoholism? No way. He just used alcohol as a blackmail weapon when
she tried to get him to quit smoking.
He used alcohol to get his own way,
and he holds that weapon in reserve for use against her again.
At any time, he can blackmail her with more threats to relapse and drink
if she doesn't let him have his own way.
He is still using alcohol as an easy solution to his problems.
But Bill Wilson arbitrarily declared that &quot;his more
serious ailments were being rapidly cured&quot;,
because Bill wanted to make the A.A. program look good.

<li> <b>Rationalize</b><br>

This one is great, an old classic. Rationalization. No matter what
you or somebody else did, you can always rationalize
it, and justify it somehow, and put a happy face on it.
<p>
For instance,
<ul>
<p>
<li>
&quot;Tommy did it. O.J. got away with it. So I should be able to do it too.&quot;
<p> <li> &quot;I did it for the children.&quot;
<p><li> &quot;Well, he did his best.&quot;

<p> <li> When politicians are caught telling lies about their opponents,
they rationalize,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Well, the other side did it first.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
Or,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Well, my opponents do it all of the time. I have to fight fire with fire
or else I'll lose.&quot;<br>
</i></font>

<p>
<li>
Politicians also rationalize their lies and distortions by saying,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;But we will lose the election if we tell the voters the truth.
We are using dirty tricks for the good of America.&quot;<br>
</i></font>
They overlook the obvious objection that if they will lose elections by
telling the American people the truth, then maybe they are pushing the
wrong programs. They certainly are not supporting democracy &#8212; democracy
requires that the voters know what they are really voting for.

<p>
<li>
And when they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar, they say,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Well, it's the system. That's just how it is done. Everybody's doing it.
You have to cooperate with the system and not make waves. Go along to get along...&quot;
</i></font>
</ul>

<p>
<center><table width="96%" border="4" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

The Bush administration is having to do a lot of rationalizing, lately.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We have to invade Iraq and take out Saddam Hussein because he threatens us
with an imminent attack with Weapons of Mass Destruction,&quot;</i></font>
they said.
Tony Blair even said that Saddam had a 45-minute-to-launch capability.
<p>
But you know what happened. No WMD. Nothing. Not even close. No yellow-cake
uranium from Niger.
Not even one missile that could hit England, never mind the USA.
So they rationalized,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Well, we had to stop Saddam from giving WMD to al Qaeda.
It's because of September 11.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
But there were no such weapons. And even more importantly,
<ul>
<li> Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda and al Qaeda hated Saddam.
<li> They never worked together, and Saddam Hussein had nothing to
do with September 11.
<li> Osama bin Laden is a fundamentalist religious fanatic, and
Saddam Hussein was a secular military dictator who killed the Islamic religious extremists
who made trouble for him. They didn't get along at all.
<li> Osama bin Laden even made a videotape shortly before the USA attacked Iraq,
telling the Islamic radicals to ignore Saddam Hussein because he wasn't a friend.
</ul>

<p>
So the Bush administration rationalized,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Well, at least we got rid of a bad guy. Now Iraq can have
democracy and freedom.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
But you know what happened. Ayatollah al Sistani demanded real democracy and an
elected government, immediately. You know, one man, one vote, and all of that
old American stuff. But the Bushies said,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Oh, noooo! You can't do that! You will elect the wrong
people! I'll tell you what: You can have an election where you can only vote
for the candidates that we choose. On second thought, why don't
we just forget about that whole democracy thing for a while.
We will just appoint a council of rulers for you.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>

So they rationalized,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Well, at least we got rid of the bad guy.
Saddam Hussein was torturing and killing his own people.&quot;</i></font>

<p>
But you know what happened.
<ul>
<li> Torture of prisoners in <i>Abu Ghraib</i> prison.
<li> Rapes of women prisoners.
<li> The homosexual rape of a teenage boy.
<li> At least 35 deaths of prisoners while under interrogation (overly enthusiastic questioning), and 2 known deliberate murders.
<li> Lots of pictures.
<li> Naked men stacked in pyramids.
<li> Sadistic torture.
<li> Police dogs biting them.
<li> Photographs of naked women prisoners taking showers.
<li> A 70-year-old Iraqi woman stripped naked, shoved to the floor, and ridden like a donkey by a British soldier.
<li> Unreleased video tapes, perhaps even showing Iraqi women being raped and Iraqi male prisoners being murdered.
<li> Pornography films: Reports of a video tape showing a certain U.S. Army woman having consensual sex with her boyfriend in front of Iraqi prisoners.
<li> Snuff films. Really hot stuff, much better than what you can get at your local adult bookstore.
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue">
[Wow, the U.S. Army snuff films are even better than the Mexican ones.
Heck, they're even better than Mel Gibson's <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> &#8212;
you know, <i>&quot;Mad Max and Jesus Meet the Road
Warrior in the Thunderdome, and the Road Warrior Wins&quot;</i>.]
</font>

<p>
How will they rationalize their way out of this one?
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Well, they were bad guys. We grabbed them off of the streets because they
looked at us cross-eyed. Maybe his second cousin took a pot-shot at us.
They don't appreciate the freedom we are giving them.
Besides, we need to get information out of them. It's just part of the
'softening-up' process, before interrogation.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
But you know what happened. The U.S. military generals
admitted, in the U.S. Senate Hearings (2004-05-11),
that 70 to 90 percent of the prisoners in <i>Abu Ghraib</i> prison were innocent,
just grabbed by mistake in sweeps of the streets.
<p>
So how will they rationalize their way out of this one?<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Well, those abuse things were only done by a few bad apples.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>
&#8212; In spite of the fact that it was done by both American and British soldiers in
several different prisons over a long span of time,
and there are <i>thousands</i> of pictures that document an
on-going program of abuse, and now an American colonel has sworn that
the commanding general in charge of intelligence watched it being done.<br>

<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<LI>
&#8212; And in spite of the fact that the commander of military intelligence
in Iraq is
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Bush12" target="_blank">General Jerry Boykin, the religious fanatic</a>
who declared that the war in Iraq is a holy war between Christianity and Islam.
All of those Military Intelligence Officers who go into the prisons and use

Alcoholics Anonymous also teaches us how to rationalize.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
For example, if a critic says,
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson cheated on his wife Lois
a lot</a>, both before and after sobriety. He took sexual advantage of sick women who came to
A.A. seeking help to avoid death from alcohol. Bill even had the gall to be
routinely unfaithful to Lois while she was working in a department store
to support his lazy ass.
And Bill even used the Alcoholics Anonymous headquarters as an employment
agency for his many mistresses who couldn't even type.
That is hardly what I would call a good spiritual role model.&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
You can answer,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It just goes to show that Bill Wilson was human,
and not a saint, and that's wonderful, because it means that ordinary
people like you and I can recover, too. So
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Nan_rationalizes" target="_blank">Bill Wilson had
to be human</a>, and not a saint, so that he could help others.
It was the Will of God.&quot;
</i></font>


<p>
<li>
Likewise:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;All of that vague, confusing, grandiose, contradictory stuff
that Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> is okay.
Even if Bill wasn't a great writer, that book will still save
your life. Eventually, you will be able to figure out what it
means.&quot;
</i></font>


<p>
<li>
And:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Bill Wilson had to steal the <i>Big Book</i>
publishing fund and the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i>,

<a name="ftnt17_ret"> </a>
<a name="exchange_term"> </a>
<li> <b>Exchange A Term</b><br>
Exchange a term in your opponent's argument, thereby redefining the debate
to better suit your own prejudices.
<p>
Back in the nineteen-sixties, when proponents of psychedelic drugs spoke
of visions of paradise, critical newspaper editors changed the wording to
visions of an &quot;inferno&quot;.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt17">17</a></sup></font>

<p>
Those women who desire control over their reproductive lives
call their goal &quot;Pro-Choice&quot;, and they call their opponents
&quot;anti-abortion&quot;.
The opponents of abortion, on the other hand, call themselves
&quot;Pro-Life&quot;, while calling their opponents &quot;pro-abortion people&quot;.
<p>
Con artists who are trying to get people to participate in illegal chain letters and
pyramid sales schemes brag, &quot;I made $3000 in my first week.&quot;
What we call criminal fraud, they call &quot;making money&quot;.

<p>
When the Chinese People's Army attacked and conquered Tibet, and brutally murdered
great numbers of innocent people, the Chinese leaders called it
&quot;the liberation of Tibet&quot;, while we call it &quot;the invasion of Tibet&quot;.
<p>
Likewise, George W. Bush calls the invasion of Iraq &quot;giving them freedom&quot;
and &quot;liberating them from a dictator&quot;
(accompanied by a only a little &quot;collateral damage&quot;),
while the Iraqi resistance calls it the invasion and occupation of their country,
accompanied by the murder of their families, children, and neighbors by the massive use of
firepower and dropping cluster bombs in civilian neighborhoods during
Donald Rumsfeld's <i>Shock And Awe</i> bombing.
<p>
G. W. Bush complains that &quot;foreign fighters&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;
have come into Iraq from the outside and are making trouble.
The Iraqis say that they are the &quot;freedom fighters&quot;, and that
the Americans are the &quot;foreign fighters&quot;
and the &quot;terrorists&quot; who came from other countries to enforce the will
of the Bush family and their oil company friends with &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; bombing.

Likewise, in Israel:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The formula is simple: suicide in the West is thought to be caused by despair,
hoplessness, panic, and mental illness, so we assume that such must be the case
among Moslems. To date, we have been unable to see the issue through any but Western
eyes, and so have missed recognizing that the young Palestinian bombers are seen
by large numbers of Muslims as heroes who are willing to sacrifice their lives &#8212;
in martyrdom, not suicide attacks &#8212; for a cause that is greater than themselves
and sanctioned by their God. What the West sees as tragic brutality practiced by
despairing or deviant individuals is perceived in much of the Moslem world as
a heroic act of self-sacrifice, patriotism, and worship, an act to be greeted
not with condemnation and revulsion, but with awe, respect, and a determination
to emulate. Moreover, it is an act Muslims deem a just military response to
Israel's fifty-plus-year occupation of Palestine and its relegation of three
generations of Palestinians to refugee
<font color="#9F0000">[concentration]</font>
camps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus, American's evil suicide bombers can also be seen as Islam's martyr-heroes,
men and women following in the steps and under the guidance of their prophet and
according to the revealed word of their God.<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous constantly uses this technique. Talk to them about the
harmful cult practices that are embodied in
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">the Twelve Steps</a>,
and they will respond by calling the Twelve Steps &quot;spiritual principles&quot;.
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step12" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps are <i>practices</i>,
not <i>principles</i></a>.
The Twelve Steps are specific practices for people to do, things like
surrendering your will and confessing your sins, and hearing the voices
of spirits or gods or something while
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">conducting s&eacute;ances</a>,
not guidelines for a spiritual life.


<p><br>
<a name="frame_argument"> </a>
<li> <b>Frame The Argument</b><br>
This is very closely related to <i>Exchange A Term</i>; in fact, they are often
identical. You can re-frame an argument by exchanging a term and redefining the debate
in terms that you like better.
<p>
When someone says that conservative politics should be about preserving the Constitution Of
The United States and the Bill Of Rights that our Founders gave us,
twist the argument around to &quot;defending the
country from terrorists who don't deserve Constitutional protections&quot;.
Suddenly it becomes okay to violate loyal Americans' rights because terrorists don't deserve any rights.

<p>
Comcast uses this technique when they cry about heavy users of the Internet
stealing bandwidth from other users, as in
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Those people who download movies are slowing down the Internet for everybody else.&quot;
</font>
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The truth is, Comcast is saddled with a very limited technology: sharing
a cable &#8212; trying to cram all of the data communications of a neighborhood
into one single thin cable, which means that the available bandwidth is inherently very
limited. You can only cram so much data through one piece of wire.
And the more customers who share that cable, the less bandwidth each customer gets, so the slower it gets.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But rather than admit that Comcast cannot supply sufficient bandwidth to
meet their customers' needs and desires &#8212; to whom Comcast has sold &quot;high speed connections&quot; &#8212;
Comcast frames the argument as some heavy users taking too much.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They are taking more than their fair share. Things would be fine if nobody used very much.&quot;
</font>

<br>
<font color="blue">
(That also smacks of finding a scapegoat to blame:
<i>It isn't Comcast's fault for not investing in infrastructure and building a good network;
it's the fault of users who want to actually use the connection that they paid for.</i>)

program was an illegal violation of the American peoples' Constitutional protection

President Obama said,  &quot;...Whatever benefits this program has, may be

Alcoholics Anonymous likes to frame opposition to A.A. in terms of &quot;the atheists versus

theology is not Christian at all &#8212;
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">it is grossly heretical</a>, and conflicts with

For example: The Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP)
is an organization that does just what its title sounds like: it investigates claims of the
paranormal. That often results in its debunking some phony psychics and quack healers and various
other fakes and charlatans.
<p>
That really annoyed some people who didn't like to see their favorite scams exposed.
They fired back by declaring that,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;CSICOP [is] a defensive league of American Scientists whose

</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Skeptical Inquirer</i>, Nov/Dec 2001, page 67.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a mischaracterization of CSICOP.

<p>
Such mischaracterization is standard behavior for the Bush administration.
In April, 2007, when Congress put into a funding bill a non-binding
resolution asking for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, George W. Bush declared,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I will strongly reject an artificial timetable withdrawal, and/or
Washington politicians trying to tell those who wear the uniform how to
do their job.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
As if there was a &quot;non-artificial&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; time-table for withdrawal from Iraq?
<p>
<li>
And isn't George W. Bush the biggest politician in Washington who is telling the generals what to do?
Isn't he the Commander In Chief, as well as &quot;the decider&quot;?<br>
(Bush routinely hides behind the generals, and says that he is
&quot;supporting them&quot; when things aren't
going well. But he is the one who is giving the orders.)
</ol>

<p>
Likewise, Vice President Cheney declared:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Some Democratic leaders seem to believe that blind opposition to
the new strategy in Iraq is good politics.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Is opposition to the administration's policies &quot;blind&quot;,
or a well-informed and well-thought-out, considered, rational response to four years of failure?
<p>
<li> What new strategy? &quot;The Surge&quot; is just sending in a few
more troops. This &quot;new strategy&quot;
comes from the administration that, way back at the beginning of the war,
fired the generals who said that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
wasn't sending in enough troops to do the job properly. Remember General Shinseki, who
was fired for declaring to Congress that Rumsfeld was not sending in nearly enough
troops to accomplish the job?<br>
(Will those generals who were right all along get their jobs back and
get another star for being right? Not likely. G. W. Bush gives more stars
to those generals who say that he is right about everything.)
<p>
<li> And Cheney declares that the opposition must be rooted in &quot;politics&quot;.
The opposition couldn't possibly be based on principles and intelligent, realistic,
well-thought-out decision-making,
presumably because reasonable American people cannot possibly have good cause
for disagreeing with the administration, even after four years of shifting goals and lies
and incompetence, and cover-ups and misinformation and fabricated stories,
and secret prisons and renditions and torture and war crimes and declaring
the Geneva Convention &quot;quaint&quot;, and the loss of far more troops in Iraq than Americans
killed and maimed on 9/11.

Yeh, right. As if you were planning to before that unfortunate

George Will criticized:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Conservative columnist George Will attacked Bill O’Reilly’s new book, "Killing Reagan, in the Washington Post on Thursday &#8212; calling it "a tissue of unsubstantiated assertions" that "will distort public understanding of Ronald Reagan’s presidency more than hostile but conscientious scholars could" &#8212; and to the surprise of absolutely no one, O’Reilly shot back last night.
<p>
Will’s criticism was admittedly harsh. He warned readers of O’Reilly’s book to beware, as they were "about to enter a no-facts zone," and referred to the book as "nonsensical history and execrable citizenship," so it’s not as O’Reilly wasn’t within his rights to be offended.
<p>
And offended he was. He began by noting the difference between "slander" and "libel," which Will misused in his column &#8212; because, of course, noting one error in an otherwise sound review of a book invalidates all of the other valid criticisms contained therein.<br>

<a name="quibble"> </a>
<li> <b>Quibble</b><br>
Quibble over irrelevant tiny details,
quibble over the definitions of words, quibble over anything
you can find that will divert attention from your opponent's points.
<p>
For example, when Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian defector, former
Russian spy, and author of tell-all books about the new Russian spy
agencies, was
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161130003614/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/24/uk.spypoisoned/index.html" target="_blank">poisoned
with the rare radioactive metal Polonium</a> for persistently
criticizing the Russian president/dictator Vladimir Putin, Putin claimed
that he didn't do it, that he had nothing to do with it,
because the British medical documents did not show
&quot;that it was a result of violence, this is not a violent death, so there
is no ground for speculations of this kind.&quot;
To argue that poisoning somebody with a radioactive substance
is not a &quot;violent&quot; act is quibbling over the definitions of words.
It was still murder most foul.

<p>
Another kind of quibbling is quibbling over terms, like &quot;legitimate&quot;, as in
 &quot;legitimate rape&quot;, or &quot;legitimate claims&quot; against BP.
We all remember the flap over a Republican candidate (Aiken) arguing that women didn't
get pregnant from  &quot;legitimate rape&quot;. And earlier, BP, the British oil
company, declared that
it was paying for all &quot;legitimate claims&quot; of damage from their oil spill. But they
didn't explain what kinds of hoops ruined people had to jump through to prove that
their claims were &quot;legitimate&quot;.
And how does a girl prove that her rape was &quot;legitimate&quot;, rather than
illegitimate?

<p>
On another note, one critic of mine actually spent several letters quibbling over whether
President Lincoln ever told a joke
<a href="orange-letters7.html#Lincoln" target="_blank">that contained the word &quot;ass&quot;</a>,
as in <i>&quot;maybe those generals will get off of their asses and do something&quot;</i>...
That critic tried to claim that everything I said in my web site was all wrong
because he was sure that Abraham Lincoln &#8212; the rough home-spun frontiersman
&#8212; would never use crude words in jokes.

<p><br>
<a name="hit_and_run"> </a>
<li> <b>Hit And Run</b><br>
Launch an attack on your opponent, and then run away before
your opponent can counter-attack or ask you to prove your accusations.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;That story is all wrong. It's full of factual errors.
It is so stupid that would be a waste of time to even respond to it.
It doesn't even warrant an answer.
I'm not going to waste any more time on this stupid argument.
I'm out of here.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Now you can run away without actually answering any of your opponent's
points, or supplying any facts to back up your sweeping statements and denunciations.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(And, if your opponent refutes your statements after you have left,
and supplies a lot of facts to prove that he is correct,
you can later accuse him of talking about you behind your back,
and of attacking you when you couldn't defend yourself,
which implies that he is a coward.
That stratagem has sweet touches of
<a href="#ad_hominem"><i>ad hominem</i></a>
and
<a href="#blame_victim">blame the victim</a>
in it.)
</font>


<p><br>
<a name="highfalutin_denunciations"> </a>
<li> <b>Hifalutin' Denunciations</b><br>
<p>
Denounce your opponent with vague, grand-sounding generalized accusations
that don't have very specific meanings:
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;the proposal shows a failure of initiative&quot;...
<li> &quot;his program shows a failure of imagination&quot;...
<li> &quot;he exhibits a lack of vision&quot;...
</ul>
What the heck does any of that really mean, in plain English?


<p><br>
<a name="unreasonable_demands"> </a>
<li> <b>Make Unreasonable Demands</b><br>
<p>
For example: Demand that your opponent write his whole autobiography to show
us that his life is okay without doing the Twelve Steps.
<p>
The Oxford Group cult leader Frank Buchman used this trick this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The world needs a miracle. Miracles of science have been the wonder of the
age. But they have not brought peace and happiness to the nations.
A miracle of the spirit is what we need.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Frank Buchman, speaking at Kronberg, Denmark,
Whit Sunday, 1935, quoted in<br>
<i>Remaking the World, the speeches of Frank Buchman</i>, Frank N. D. Buchman,
page 157.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
For Frank Buchman to demand that science do everything from end the Great Depression
to prevent World War Two was unreasonable.
It isn't the job of &quot;the miracles of science&quot;
like penicillin or the light bulb to do that.
Nevertheless,
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#miracles_of_science" target="_blank">Buchman then declared</a>
that his religion was the only answer, because
&quot;science&quot; didn't meet his demands.

<p>
One contemporary booster of Alcoholics Anonymous used that trick like this:
When I stated that
<a href="orange-letters18.html#Athens_Georgia" target="_blank">93% of the drug and alcohol
treatment facililities in the USA use the 12-Step approach</a>, he demanded
a list of all of those facilities, including the names of the owners,
addresses, and phone numbers.

<p><br>
<a name="false_demands"> </a>
<li> <b>Make False Demands</b><br>
<p>
For example: Demand that your opponent prove that his life
is still full of <i>&quot;Serenity and Gratitude&quot;</i>,
in spite of his not doing the Twelve Steps.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That demand is false because normal, sane, people do not
judge their lives by how much &quot;Serenity and Gratitude&quot;
they have; nor do they believe that a good life must be emotionally
flat, without any of the other emotions
like the passions, the love and the anger,
the agony and the ecstasy, that make us
greater than the rocks.
</font>

<p><br>
<a name="shift_burden"> </a>
<li> <b>Shift the Burden of Proof Onto Your Opponent</b><br>
Make all kinds of unsubstantiated statements and claims, and when your opponent objects
and challenges those statements, say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Do some research on the
subject and you will see that what I am saying is true.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
It is the job of the person who is making the statements and claims
to do the research and supply the evidence to support his assertions.
</font>
<p>
Other uses of this technique are:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> &quot;Just google it and you will find the answers.&quot;
<p><li> &quot;If you would do your homework and study the subject, you would know what the facts are.&quot;
<p><li> &quot;It would make sense to you if you read the Bible in the original Greek.&quot; (That one is
courtesy of Sinclair Lewis, in his great novel about a phony preacher, <i>Elmer Gantry</i>.)

<p><br>
<a name="double_standards"> </a>
<li> <b>Double Standards</b><br>
This is a well-known propaganda and debating technique. One standard or set of rules
applies to one group, and a very different set of rules applies to another group.
Also known as <i><b>hypocrisy</b></i>, when the easier, looser, standards apply to oneself.
<p>
For example:

<ul>
<p><li> 
Men who philander are called &quot;real ladies' men&quot;,
while women who philander are considered whores.
<p><li> 
Men are &quot;demanding bosses&quot;, while similar women are &quot;bitches&quot;.
<p><li> 
Men who climb the corporate ladder while sleeping with several women are &quot;normal, healthy,
hard-working achievers&quot;, while women who do the same are guilty of &quot;sleeping their way
to the top.&quot;

<p><li> Poor people who get money from the government are &quot;takers&quot;,
and &quot;leeches getting handouts&quot;, but rich people who get millions or billions of dollars
from the government are &quot;smart businessmen&quot;.

<p><li>
The extremist Right-winger Senators and Congressmen say that extending unemployment benefits for
poor unemployed people removes their incentive to go get a job. (Ignore the fact that there
are not enough jobs to go around.) But giving
hundreds of billions of dollars to Wall Street gamblers to bail them out after they
lost gigantic bets does not remove their incentive to act responsibly, and stop gambling with
other people's money.

<p><li> Similarly, &quot;Conservative&quot; politicians say that giving money to poor people
in various aid programs removes their incentive to strive and succeed in life.
Those lazy poor people won't work hard and accomplish great things if they aren't hungry.
But letting rich people's children inherit millions or billions of dollars tax-free does not
remove their incentive to work hard and excel.

<p><li>
Poor people whose houses are foreclosed were financially irresponsible, and they
deserve to lose their homes. But ultra-rich bankers who gambled and bet everything
and lost and bankrupted their banks are &quot;too big to fail&quot;, and must be
bailed out with the poor taxpayers' money &quot;for the good of us all.&quot;

<p><li> Police officers and judges who take bribes are corrupt criminals,
but Senators and Congressmen who take bribes to vote a certain way are
&quot;great statesmen who are serving their nation&quot;.

<p><li>
A.A. members talk constantly about God and &quot;Higher Power&quot;, and declare that God is
keeping them from drinking, and doing all kinds of wonderful things for them,
granting their wishes and doing favors for them,
and they don't consider that excessive, or obsession
with religion. But when somebody else talks about God, and even dares to mention
Jesus Christ,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#no_Jesus" target="_blank">the A.A. members attack him</a>
as a &quot;Bible-beating fundamentalist&quot;, and tell him to &quot;take it to Church&quot;.
<p>
(Conversely, if somebody does not talk about God, and declare that
&quot;Higher Power&quot; and &quot;A.A. spirituality&quot; are keeping him sober,
then he is accused of being an agnostic or an atheist. That is a
<a href="#double_bind" target="_blank"><i>Double-Bind</i></a>.)
<p>
<li> When A.A. members
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">lie, cheat,
and thirteen-step under-age girls</a>
who came to A.A. seeking help for a drug or alcohol problem, that's okay, because
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;We are not saints.&quot;</font>
But when a non-member does those things, he is a criminal who should
go to jail.

</ul>



<p><br>
<a name="uneven_burden"> </a>
<li> <b>Demand an Uneven Burden of Proof</b><br>
Use very different standards of proof for opposite sides of an argument.
<p>
For example: Exhaustively fact-check and nit-pick an opponent's statements, but do not
challenge outrageous claims made by friends and allies.
<p>
Another example: demand very strong, iron-clad, absolute proof for
an opponent's statements, while insisting
that the flimsiest of evidence proves one's own statements to be true.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is a past master of this stunt.
In the opinion of Alcoholics Anonymous pundits:
<p>
<ol>
<li><ul>
<li> If one person quits drinking while attending A.A. meetings, then that
&quot;proves&quot; that A.A. works.
<li> The numerous A.A. members who relapse do not prove that A.A. doesn't work.
</ul>
<p>
<li><ul>
<li> If one person relapses, even once, while <i>not</i> attending A.A. meetings,
then that &quot;proves&quot; that nobody can do it alone.
<li> The numerous &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; people who succeed in getting sober and staying sober
without A.A. meetings do not prove that people can get sober without Alcoholics Anonymous,
because those people <i>might</i> relapse some day.
A.A. boosters do not ask whether the other sober A.A. members are likely to eventually relapse.
(Nor do they bother to keep count of those who did.)
</ul>
<p>
<li> <ul>
<li> If someone has a bad drinking problem and he quits drinking while going to A.A. meetings,
then that proves that he was a real alcoholic and A.A. works.
<li> If someone has a bad drinking problem and he quits drinking without going to A.A. meetings,
then that proves that he was not a real alcoholic.
(<a href="#real_Scotsman"><i>The Real Scotsman Fallacy</i></a>)
It doesn't prove that alcoholics can quit drinking without A.A.

</ul>
</ol>


<p><br>
<a name="uneven_acceptance"> </a>
<li> <b>Demand Uneven Standards of Acceptance</b><br>
Demand very different standards of acceptance and tolerance for statements and beliefs
from opposite sides of an argument.
This is a variation on the technique of <i>demanding an uneven burden of proof</i>.
<p>
For example,
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
Demand that your opponents accept your statements and illogical beliefs
in the name of open-mindedness and tolerance,
while simultaneously attacking and shredding your opponents' statements and beliefs,
and being very intolerant of other peoples' opinions.
<p><li>
Call other peoples' criticism of your policies and attitudes
&quot;prejudiced, narrow-minded, and intolerant&quot;,
while freely criticizing your opponents' policies and attitudes.
<p><li>
Harshly criticize other people's religions and beliefs, while demanding that people
respect your religion and not criticize it. (Alcoholics Anonymous does this one often.)

<p><li>
Complain that your opponents are inconsiderate and don't care whose feelings
they hurt with harsh criticism, while having no such problems with criticizing others.
(That is also an example of hypocrisy.)

</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="specious_argument"> </a>
<li> <b>Specious Argument</b><br>
When you can't think of anything better to say, make a specious argument.

<p>
For example, during a debate about Mary McCarthy, the CIA analyst who revealed the existence of illegal
secret CIA prisons in foreign countries where kidnapped people were held incommunicado and tortured,
Ray McGovern, a former CIA analyst,
called such activities war crimes and declared that McCarthy was obligated to reveal
the existence of such activities.
Richard Kerr, a former CIA assistant director and current Bush administration apologist,
argued that if McCarthy had moral objections to such
projects, she should have resigned her position and then criticized the
policy but without revealing any classified information. Kerr didn't bother
to mention that even if she resigned, McCarthy would still be barred by
the National Secrets Act from revealing the existence of the secret
illegal prisons and torture centers, so her resigning in silent protest
would accomplish nothing.

<p><br>
<a name="spurious_agreement"> </a>
<li> <b>Spurious Agreement</b><br>
An utterance, typically with a strong emotional content,
designed to establish a false sense of agreement:
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Don't you <b><i>want</i></b> to live forever?&quot;</font>
This is an attempt to placate an opponent in a debate.
<p>
Amway recruiters ask, &quot;Don't you want financial security?&quot;
<p>
Bill Wilson taught Alcoholics Anonymous recruiters to use
this technique on prospects who had religious beliefs that were
different from Bill's:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Your prospect may belong to a religious denomination.
His religious education and training may be far superior to
yours. In that case he is going to wonder how you can add
anything to what he already knows. But he will be curious to
learn why his own convictions have not worked and why yours seem
to work so well. He may be an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.<br>
...<br>
Admit that he probably knows more about it [religion] than you do,
but call to his attention the fact that however deep his faith and
knowledge, he could not have applied it or he would not drink.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, page 93.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson does not think that the prospect knows more about
religion than he does &#8212; Bill thinks that the prospective new recruit
is wrong about everything.
Bill only pretends to agree with the prospect long enough to sell
him on the A.A. religion.
<p>
Bill Wilson is actually saying that the other guy's religion is
worthless because it didn't keep him from drinking. Bill stubbornly
ignored the obvious implication that, by that logic,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">all of the relapsers
in Alcoholics Anonymous</a>
prove that Bill Wilson's religion is also worthless.

<a name="escape_via_ignorance"> </a>
<li> <b>Escape via Ignorance</b><br>
When stuck with an unanswerable question, allude to an existing answer
unknown to either party:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Maybe I can't answer your point,
but any of the Elders at our congregation could.&quot;</i></font>
(But then the elders forget to come and answer the questions...)
<p>
Similarly, you can dismiss all arguments put forth so far by arguing,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;I wish we had an expert here, who really knew about these things.&quot;
</i></font>


<a name="ftnt08_ret"> </a>
<p><br>
<a name="escape_via_future"> </a>
<li> <b>Escape to the Future</b><br>
When stuck with an unanswerable question, allude to an answer that will
allegedly become known at a future date.
<p>
Jehovah's Witnesses argue:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Maybe I can't answer your point,
but we Witnesses are told to 'Wait on Jehovah' when we encounter things
we can't understand. He eventually provides us with the
answers.&quot;</i></font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt08">8</a></sup></font><br>

A defender of a particular brand of camera deflected criticism of the camera with the remark,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Just pick up the camera and shoot with it and then decide.&quot;
</i></font>
&#8212; Which did not actually answer the questions and criticisms at all.
The speaker imagined that people would like the camera, and not
notice the defects and shortcomings, if they just handled and used the camera.

<p><br>
<a name="escape_via_relativism"> </a>
<li> <b>Escape via Relativism</b><br>
Dismiss an irrefutable argument as simply a point of view:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Well, that's just your
opinion.&quot;</i></font><br>
This can interrupt and sabotage a chain of logic.
<p>
Another common phrase is,<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Everybody has their own
opinion&quot;</i></font><br>
&#8212; as if every opinion is backed up with equally valid or equally compelling evidence.
<p>
And another is,

A native who didn't understand how genetic analysis of people revealed the origins

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You have your creation myths, and we have ours. Why should your myths be more true than

<a href="orange-letters7.html#ten_opinions" target="_blank">A letter from an A.A. member</a>
criticized my analysis of treatment programs (A.A. versus non-A.A.)
by writing:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If there are 10 interpretations of an event, you
... accept the one that suits your beliefs, and ignore all the others.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

The writer simply assumed that all opinions had equal merit, and that
all interpretations of failed treatment programs' results were equally
valid. He even ignored the fact that a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>,
Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, 
was the doctor who reported that his
A.A-based treatment program had failed to help the alcoholics, and that,
by Vaillant's own admission, for eight years his A.A.-based
treatment program had an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate in spite of his persistent
attempts to make A.A. produce good results.
The critic also ignored the obvious fact that whether people are
dead isn't just a matter of someone's opinion.
<p>
Other examples:
<ul>
<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Leave AA on the table for those who choose to try it.&quot;
</font>
&#8212; as if A.A. is just as good as any other treatment for
alcohol or drug problems, and should get equal consideration.
<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The goal is to get sober &#8212; you can take 45 to Dallas or you
 can take 35 to Dallas &#8212; you still get to Dallas anyway.&quot;
</font>
&#8212; as if A.A. is just as effective as any other treatment. It isn't.
</ul>

<p>
There are several variations on this <i>escape via relativism</i> technique:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Declare that both sides of any issue should get equal representation, as if arguments
for or against slavery or freedom have equal merit, and should get equal time and space. So should
arguments for and against justice or injustice, peace or war, celibacy or child-molestation,
racial discrimination or equality,
or good or evil. Just demand that everything gets equal consideration.
&quot;We have to consider both sides of the issue now. The other side might have a point.&quot;

<p><li>
Demand that presentations and news coverage not be &quot;biased&quot;.
Again, both good and reprehensible positions should be given equal time and
consideration, in the interest of &quot;fairness&quot;. If one side has
overwhelming evidence and good arguments in its favor, just don't mention
all of that stuff &#8212; only feature a few arguments from each side,
for &quot;balanced&quot; coverage.

<p>
<a name="antirationalism2"> </a> 
<li>
Declare that the issue is &quot;controversial&quot;.
The goal is to leave the impression that we
can't really decide the issue and arrive at a conclusion, and determine
the truth, because there are just too many conflicting opinions.
(As if all of those different opinions were equally valid and really worth considering.)
<p>
That ploy uses
<a href="#antirationalism"><b><i>antirationalism</i></b></a>.
Antirationalism is the idea that there are no such things
as valid, reliable facts or hard indisputable evidence, just various conflicting opinions.
Speakers who are pushing antirationalism argue that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just my opinion versus your opinion, and it's all so controversial that
we can't decide anything for sure. You never really know anything for sure, do you?&quot;
</font>
<p>
<i>
And the people who don't wish for anything to be decided are the people
who do not have enough facts, or any facts, to back up their arguments
and support their opinions, and who are losing the debate.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;So let's agree to disagree, and not decide anything,&quot;
</font>
they say.
</i>

<p>
For example, when an A.A. booster was presented with evidence that A.A.-based
treatment does not work, he replied:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Yes you are rite [<i>sic.</i>] you can find almost anything on the internet,
but just because it there doesn't mean it's true. There are many who
claim there was not Holocaust, that it was all in the Jews imagination.
I got in a rather heated conflict with someone over that. I said that I
guess the numbers tatooed on my father's arm was his imagination. I am
of the belief that I could care less how you get sober as long as you
get there. If you believe that sitting in a corner 3 hours a day repeating
multiflication tables will get and keep you sober &#8212; you try it and it
works then repeat all you want &#8212; it's ok &#8212; however if it dosn't work then
try something else &#8212; till you find what does. Everyone is different &#8212;
and everyone should be able to choose for themselves which type of recovery
road they want to take.&quot;<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, everyone should be able to choose their recovery program &#8212; I'm very opposed to
sentencing people to A.A. meetings &#8212; but people should be told the truth about
A.A. recovery, and the truth about the other treatment modalities too.  Telling them
<font color="#4f007f"><i>Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly
followed our path</i></font> is just lying to sick people.
</font>

<p><li>
Claiming that experiences are relative is another variation on the same escape:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, that was just your experience. Other people experienced the opposite.&quot;</font><br>

Another variation on this technique is dismissing criticism of something by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Your mileage may vary...&quot;</font>,
as if someone's bad experiences with something are just a personal problem,
irrelevant to other people.<br>
As in,

</font>

And another variation on this technique is to dismiss someone's statements
or complaints as &quot;just an opinion&quot;, or &quot;just a viewpoint&quot;.
Recently, a Veterans' Administration spokesman dismissed the complaints
of a crippled, blinded veteran of the Iraq War who was
not getting full benefits for his disabilities with this condescending statement,

Certainly, however, the spiritual dimension that is so strong in AA
is at odds with the scientific, medical tradition. Says Dr. Ken:
&quot;We [physicians] tend to be analytical. Spirituality is a gut or
heart-felt experience that certainly can't be scientifically studied
and falls outside our training.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Dr. Whitfield agrees that AA's effectiveness can't be explained in
scientific terms, or tested in controlled studies.<br>

</font>

<p>
But the simplest, most obvious reason that A.A.'s effectiveness cannot
be  explained or measured in valid scientific or medical tests is because
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank"><i><b>there is no effectiveness to measure</b></i> &#8212;
A.A. doesn't work at all</a>.
To explain that A.A. works in some mystical, magical
manner that cannot be measured or explained is dishonest.
If A.A. works, then groups of alcoholics who get A.A.-based &quot;treatment&quot; should
have a lower death rate than other groups of alcoholics who get no &quot;treatment&quot; at all.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">They don't</a>.
And A.A. members should have a lower binge-drinking rate.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">They don't</a>.
<p>
Inducing pleasant &quot;gut or heart-felt experiences&quot;
is not at all the same thing as curing alcoholism or saving the alcoholics'
lives &#8212; which is supposed to be the goal of A.A., but which A.A. does
not actually do. So the author is also using the propaganda tricks of
changing the subject,
<a href="#divert">diverting attention away from the point</a>,
and
pulling a bait-and-switch stunt there: First the goal is
to save the lives of alcoholics by making them quit drinking,
and then suddenly the goal is to induce
&quot;gut or heart-felt experiences&quot; that can't be measured.

<li> <b>Pack the House</b><br>
&#8212; with crowds of sycophant followers, shills, and hand-picked audiences.
<p>
Politicians and phoney gurus often come attended by an entourage
of fawning sycophants, because it makes them look much more important,
like a real leader.
<p>
In November of 1922, the Lauzanne Conference was assembled to revise the Turkish Peace Treaty.
When the British and French representatives, British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon
and French Prime Minister M. Poincar&eacute;,
went to see the very new Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini (who had been in office only
a few weeks),<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There, in the Hall of the Grand Hotel, Mussolini awaited them. He held in his hand a thick
black stick, which at that time never left him, and was surrounded by a phalanx of young
Fascist secretaries of pugnacious appearance, dressed in black shirts and black fezes with
long tassels.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was a situation for which nothing in the past experience of the French and 
British statesmen had prepared them. An exchange of glacial salutations took place.
Then followed a constrained silence. The Duce broke this by suggesting that his visitors
might like to dine after their journey.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>I Know These Dictators</i>, George Ward Price, page 217.

</blockquote>
<p>
Politicians also like to pack audiences. Richard Nixon was infamous for bussing in
loads of Young Republicans to pack the stands at the Republican National Convention so
that the TV cameras would see crowds of enthusiastic young people cheering for Nixon.
George W. Bush always packs audiences with hand-picked, loyalty-checked sympathizers
&#8212; he refuses to allow dissenters anywhere near his rallies and conventions.
He isolates them in small fenced so-called &quot;Free Speech Zones&quot; a mile or so away.
(G. W. Bush has somehow forgotten that all of the United States of America is supposed to be a 
free speech zone.)

<p>
<a name="ftnt21_ret"> </a>
The cult leader Frank Buchman used a variation on this trick: Move the debate to a favorable forum.
When someone was arguing with him, Buchman declared:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you have any objections, the proper place to raise them is on the convention floor.
I will debate you
there.&quot;</font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt21">21</a></sup></font><br>
But the Moral Re-Armament convention was packed with Buchman's loyal followers, of course.
No matter what Buchman said, the audience would cheer and yell its approval.
With the audience acting as the judge and jury of the debate, Buchman couldn't lose.

<p>
Politicians also like to use planted shills to ask favorable questions in fake town hall
meetings or press conferences. George W. Bush is notorious for doing that.
Recently, Bush's favorite White House shill &#8212;
&quot;James Gucker&quot; or &quot;James Gannon&quot; &#8212; was a total fraud
&#8212; a male homosexual &quot;escort&quot;, not a news reporter &#8212; who
attended White House press conferences while using an alias
<i>(really great White House security there, yes?)</i>,
and then asked G. W. Bush easy cream-puff questions like

<a name="Beverly_Nichols19"> </a>
Back in the 1930s, the Oxford Group cult was notorious for self-promotion
and recruiting by using
vicious tactics like Beverly Nichols bragged about in this story.
(The embarrassing questions that Oxford Groupers liked to ask usually pertained to
people's private sexual habits, like masturbation.)
Here, Nichols was trying to sell
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#confessions1" target="_blank">the Oxford Group practice of public confessions</a>
to a vicar:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... We will assume that we are addressing somebody who is, at least in theory,
a Christian, in order to emphasize the importance of the Group's attitude to
confession and the consciousness of sin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They have a practice they call 'sharing,' which means that they confess to one
another and not only to God. A lot of cheap laughs have been gained at the
expense of the Group through a misunderstanding of this practice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'I regard it as pernicious,' said a very bright young vicar to me, after I
had come down from Oxford. 'It might lead to very great abuses.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Have you ever tried it?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Certainly not.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Why not? Because it's so unpleasant?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He began to grow red in the face. 'Are you suggesting that I shirk
confessing my sins in prayer?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'No. But will you give me a quite honest answer to a question?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Yes,' he said rashly.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Very well. And when you've answered it, I'd be glad if you'd tell me,
equally honestly, whether it was easier to tell the truth to me, to a man,
face to face, or whether it would have been easier to shut your eyes and
mumble a few polite phrases to God.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'You are extremely offensive,' said the vicar.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Not nearly so offensive as I'm going to be.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I then asked the question.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I did not get an answer. But by the horror in that man's eyes, I knew
the answer he would have given if he had dared.<br>

<p>
Beverly Nichols did not actually prove that there was any virtue in the Oxford Group's practices;
nor did he even supply a good argument;
he merely shut down the debate by embarrassing the other fellow.
<p>
(The Oxford Group taught Beverly Nichols how to be a really insufferable arrogant
little prig who smugly asserted that he had unquestionable truths
and who didn't care how much he hurt other people's feelings in his pursuit
of victory in arguments.
But later, Nichols completely reversed his opinion of the Oxford Group.
He discovered that his conversion to the Oxford Group had
all been based on a fraud &#8212; that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Beverly_Nichols_confession" target="_blank">the Oxford Group had
deceived him into joining</a>,
and that the whole cult was just a big con.)

Pretend that you didn't hear it; do not in any way recognize that it even exists.

and God supposedly talks to them in s&eacute;ances and gives them power...
and also restores them to sanity.
Six of the 12 Steps refer to &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Him&quot; or your &quot;Higher Power&quot;, and the 12 Traditions refer

<a href="orange-rroot090.html#AJRussell_3" target="_blank">the Bishop of Durham told a story</a>
about a foolish member of the Oxford Group who pledged his love to one girl on Friday,
but who suddenly believed that he had received &quot;Guidance&quot; from God
to propose marriage to a different girl on the following Monday. The father
of the first girl complained to the Bishop:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;<i>The young man had written a love-letter to his daughter on the Friday, but

'The father said he wanted a horse-whipping, for his sense of decency should have come in
to check such ungentlemanly conduct.

<p>
The other Oxford Group members did not wish to seriously consider the
flaws in their
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">occult practice of Guidance</a>
(imagining that they were receiving infallible messages from God),
so they just laughed at the sad story of a girl who was

This technique works best when your debating opponent is half your size.
Be very careful when trying this technique on people who are much larger
than you are &#8212; they might not put up with it.

<p><br>
<a name="shutdown"> </a>
<li> <b>Shut Down the Debate</b><br>
When you can't win the debate, just stop it:
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Don't be disrespectful.&quot;
<li> &quot;I'm not going to argue with you.&quot;
<li> &quot;Don't be sacreligious.&quot;
<li> &quot;Quit wasting my time with your nonsense.&quot;
<li> &quot;That isn't worth discussing.&quot;
<li> &quot;I don't have the time for this bullshit.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
Obviously, this trick works best in an uneven situation where one side has the power
to shut down the debate, as in a parent arguing with a child, or a boss with an employee,
or a powerful politician with a common citizen.

RE: The &quot;ancients&quot;, meaning the Roman Catholic Church
authorities in the Middle Ages, were &quot;biased and unreasonable&quot;
about the &quot;realm of the spirit.&quot;
They would not tolerate any &quot;spiritual&quot;, religious, or
philosophical ideas that were different from their own.
They opposed science because
science described the world in a different way than the Bible did,
like Galileo saying that Jupiter had moons, which the authors of the Bible failed
to mention, and science asked people to use their own eyes and brains
to see the world for themselves, rather than to have blind faith in
what was written in the Bible, or to have blind faith in what some
priest said.
<p>
If Jupiter really has moons, and Galileo is right and the Bible is wrong,
then that destroys the Church's claims that the Bible is the infallible, indisputable
Word of God, and that the Church has a monopoly on God and Truth.
<p>
The ideas, &quot;Think for yourself&quot;, &quot;see for yourself&quot;,
and &quot;trust your own senses, rather than what the 'elders'
tell you&quot; were revolutionary ideas
&#8212; revolutionary in both the religious and political spheres.
They led to the overthrow of absolute authorities like The Church
and The King, and eventually led to the establishment of the European democracies.
Perhaps the most subversive idea that Martin Luther came up
with was the idea that you could communicate with God directly,
rather than having to use a priest as an intermediary.
That was the kind of stuff about which the Church was
<i>really</i> &quot;biased and unreasonable,&quot;
because that would ultimately break the power of the Church &#8212;
the Church would lose its monopoly on God.

Jan 21, 2002, page 23.<br>

Also: the NBC Evening News, and ABC Evening News, both on February 7, 2002.<br>

And: the <i>60 Minutes</i> television news program, April 14, 2002.<br>

The Newsweek article gives these figures:<br>
Ken Lay with $37,683,887,<br>
Jeff Skilling with $14,480,755,<br>
and Lou Pai with $62,936,552.<br>

The NBC Evening News listed Andrew Fastow with $30 million, and the ABC Evening
News listed Michael Kopper with $30 million, and stated that Jeffrey Skilling had
gotten $70 million from the sale of his worthless hyped Enron stock when he quit Enron.<br>

<i>60 Minutes</i> described how Rebecca Mark cashed in her Enron shares
for $79 million after robbing the nation of India for everything she
could get.<br>

The National Public Radio morning news on May 8, 2002, reported that
Senate testimony the previous day revealed that Andrew Fastow had made
$45 million from deals with off-the-books Enron subsidiaries.
<p>
The fascinating book <i>The Smartest Guys in the Room</i> by Bethany McLean
and Peter Elkind gave the following numbers:
<ul>
<li> Ken Rice, $53 million (page 299), later up to $70 million (page 335)
<li> Tom White (G. W. Bush's Secretary of the Army) $14 million (page 302)
<li> Lou Pai sold $250 million worth of Enron stock, more than anybody else
at the company (page 334)
<li> Jeff Skilling $70 million (page 350)
<li> Andy Fastow got $60.6 million out of his &quot;Special Purpose Entities&quot;
(off-the-balance-sheet limited partnerships)
which he used to hide Enron losses from stockholders and investors. He had earlier
said that it was $45 million, but he was understating the facts. (page 366)
</ul>

<p>
The <i>Nightly Business Report</i> on public television, 19 February 2004,
stated that Jeffrey Skilling was charged in the government's indictment
with getting $63 million from the sale of his Enron stock just four months
before Enron collapsed in bankruptcy.
<p>
That's quite a

Bill Wilson really had a thing about his wife nagging him.
In the <i>Big Book</i>, he also wrote these instructions to wives of
alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The first principle of success is that you should never be angry.
...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our next thought is that you should never
tell him what he must do
about his drinking. If he gets the idea that you are a nag or a
killjoy, your chance of accomplishing anything useful may be zero.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp; This may lead to lonely evenings for you. He may
seek someone else to console him &#8212; not always another man.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 111.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So don't nag your hubby about his drinking, or
else he might become moody and resentful and go spend the night
with his mistress (<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">like Bill did</a>).

<a name="Nessie"> </a>
<a name="ftnt04"> </a>
<a href="#ftnt04_ret">4)</a>
You want logic about Nessie? How about:

<ol>
<li> The small coelacanth had two entire oceans to hide in, while the
large Loch Ness monster only has a small lake. (Loch Ness is small, compared
to the American Great Lakes, or Lake Victoria in Africa, or Lake
Baikal in Russia, none of which seems to host a living dinosaur.)
<li> The same problem applies to their food supply. Nessie would only
have the fish in a lake to eat, while the coelacanth had an entire
ocean to munch on.
<li> Then the food supply problem gets much worse: To avoid extinction,
there would obviously have to be at least two living Loch Ness monsters
at all times, so they
would need twice as much fish to eat. But then they would have
offspring, and those kids need to eat too, so now they need even more
food. Somebody did the math on it and figured out that they would
strip the lake of all fish pretty quickly.  There goes the monster.
Starvation will kill it.
<li> The population problem is much worse than that, even. A species
that is reduced to two adults and two offspring will probably die out.
Lack of genetic diversity. Or some random disease, sometime in the last
60 million years. Or just bad luck &#8212; lose one of the breeding pair due
to an accident, and it's all over.
Or a drought for a few years, or something.
Or what if, for just one generation, they have only male offspring?
That's almost a certainty, eventually. Lots of families have 3 or 4 sons,
and no daughters, just by random chance.
If that happens to the Loch Ness family just one time, ever,
at any time in history, then they are extinct.

The real rules of the game of life say that you have to have
lots of individuals, at least thousands, and preferably millions or
billions (like us), if you want your species to continue.

<li> The Loch Ness has been searched, very thoroughly searched, using
fancy electronic equipment, and still, no monster.

<li> On the other hand, once some ichthyologists learned that coelacanths
really did exist,
by seeing just one dead, decomposing one, they posted a reward for
some more, and within a dozen years, the fishermen brought them several.
Seek ye and ye shall find, if it exists.
People have been looking for Nessie for a long time, and still, no
Nessie.

<li> If Nessie is really left over from the age of the dinosaurs, she
would probably be a cold-blooded reptile. But the Loch Ness is a very
cold lake, not a tropical swamp. Nessie would freeze up and be stiff as
a board, unless she evolved anti-freeze blood.
If Nessie is a warm-blooded animal, then she needs to eat and burn
even more fish to keep her body warm.
Now we are back to the food supply problem.

<li> If Nessie really lives in the North Sea, and just visits Loch Ness
through the river that flows from the Loch to the North Sea, then
it is unlikely that no one ever saw Nessie in the river. The river isn't
big or deep, so it isn't a good hiding place for a large dinosaur.
And the North Sea is notorious for being very cold, so now we are back
to the body temperature problem.

<li> Animals die and leave corpses or bones. Nobody has ever found even
one little bone from any Loch Ness monster.

</ol>

<p>
Really, it would be a lot easier to believe in the Tahiti Lagoon Monster,
or a Guamanian Godzilla that hides at the bottom of the Marianas
Trench, but nobody is talking about one of them.

This book is very good. It is a classic.
And the book is fascinating and a good read.
It really gives you the feeling of being there and going through
the brainwashing to which the American, British, and other United
Nations soldiers were subjected during the Korean War.
It also clearly explains just how the brainwashing worked and how
some men succumbed to it, and some successfully resisted it.
It also turns out that this was the first book on Communist
brainwashing published, and Hunter was actually the author
who coined the term &quot;brainwashing&quot; &#8212; it's just a
translation of the Chinese phrase <i>Hsi Nao</i>, which
Mao Tse Tung (aka Mao Zhe Dhong) and
gang used to denote the idea of washing away the vestiges of
the old system (literally &quot;cleansing the mind&quot;) in the
process of being re-educated to assume one's place in the new

This book is fascinating. It tells how the CIA was one of the first
investigators of LSD. They hoped it would make a great truth serum,
or at least a good incapacitating agent &#8212; something that would
render enemy soldiers helpless, and give us &quot;war without killing&quot;.
They did a lot of experimenting with it, trying it on
everybody from themselves to unaware civilians in San Francisco.
They even gave Ken Kesey his first dose. So bone up on your history,
kiddies. Before there was the Grateful Dead and the Merry Pranksters,
there was the CIA.

<i>The Making Of A Moonie: Brainwashing Or Choice?</i>

LC: BX9750.S4B37 1984<br>
LCCN: 84-12414<br>
Dewey: 289.9 B225m<br>
Quite good. Rather than just sensationalizing the Moonies, or
grandly proclaiming that cults can brainwash people in a few days,
like some extremist anti-cult people and professional
&quot;deprogrammers&quot; do, the author really delves into
how the recruiting and indoctrination mind games work, and how much the
victim cooperates with the program (or doesn't cooperate).
The author also reveals that the recruiters' success rate
was actually only about 0.005%
<font size="-1">(page 147)</font>. Obviously, most people
had no problems resisting the mind games.
The author even gets into psychoanalyzing the members, revealing that
many of them had mental problems before joining the Moonies, and
suggesting that that was why they joined.
This book is a breath of sanity in a field that needs more.

<i>Frank Buchman's Secret</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Peter Howard</br>
Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc., Garden City, New York, 1961.<br>
Dewey: 248 H85f<br>
More praise of Frank Buchman from Peter Howard.
Peter Howard is the man who took over the leadership of Moral
Re-Armament when Frank Buchman died. As you can imagine, he was
a true believer and had nothing but praise for Buchman.
This book is some of the most outrageous, grandiose, propaganda
you will find &#8212; cult propaganda written by one of the cult leaders.
Some pretty intense garbage.
If you wish to look straight into the mouth of the Beast,
this book will give you a good view. Some quotes:

<i>Oxford and the Groups</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Rev. G. F. Allen, John Maud, Miss B. E. Gwyer,
C. R. Morris, W. H. Auden, R. H. S. Crossman, Dr. L. P. Jacks, Rev. E. R. Micklem,

Edited by R. H. S. Crossman<br>
Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1934.<br>
LC: BV4915.C7<br>
This is a great little book; very informative. It consists of essays
from both leaders of the Oxford Groups like Rev. G. F. Allen, and
criticisms of the Groups from critics like R. H. S. Crossman. It gives
you a first-hand look at the Groups from several viewpoints, a snap-shot
in time of the thinking of contemporaries, before Buchman's public praise
of Adolf Hitler.

<i>The Fine Art of Propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's Speeches</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Institute for Propaganda Analysis; editted by
Alfred McClung Lee and Elizabeth Briant Lee<br>
Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York, 1939.<br>
LC: HM263.I54<br>
A great little book that disects
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Coughlin9" target="_blank">the hate-mongering speeches of
Father Coughlin</a> and exposes the propaganda techniques that he used.
They reduce the list of the many possible logical fallacies and
propaganda tricks to just this short list that was in Father Coughlin's toolbox:
<ol>
<li> Name Calling &#8212; giving an idea or a person a bad name
<li> Glittering Generality &#8212; create over-generalized positive images and stereotypes
<li> Transfer (also known as Association) &#8212; gaining respectability or admiration
by association with something else that is widely admired or respected
<li> Testimonial &#8212; people tell stories that praise the propagandist's favorite cause
<li> Plain Folks &#8212; it's just us regular plain good-old-boys; nothing to get upset about
<li> Card Stacking &#8212; also called Monopolistic Card Stacking &#8212; it's stacking
the odds in your favor by carefully arranging the &quot;facts&quot; while
excluding undesired facts
<li> Band Wagon &#8212; the same thing as &quot;Everybody's doing it&quot;, or
&quot;Everybody knows&quot;, or &quot;Everybody believes&quot;...

<i>The Smartest Guys in the Room; The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind<br>
Portfolio, The Penguin Group, New York, 2003.<br>

Dewey: 333.79 M163s 2003<br>
LC: HD9502.U54E5763 2003<br>
A great book, a fascinating story of brilliance, greed, ambition, arrogance, and
dishonesty.

<i>Cold Turkey</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; A movie starring Dick Van Dyke and Bob Newhart<br>
A great comedy, a classic. The basic plotline is that a backwoods town is
dying because the military base closed. Bob Newhart plays an evil tobacco executive
who wants to become the 'Alfred Nobel' of smoking by offering an huge prize
to any town that totally quits smoking for a month (which he doesn't
believe any town will ever be able to do). Dick Van Dyke plays the preacher
of the dying town, who decides that winning the prize is the only way to get
the town back on its feet. The results are both very funny and very true.
It's a great spoof on smoking and addiction.

<i>McCarthy, The Man, The Senator, The &quot;ISM&quot;</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Jack Anderson and Ronald W. May<br>
The Beacon Press, Boston, 1952.<br>
LCCN: 52-11115<br>
Dewey: B M1225A<br>
A pretty good analysis of Senator Joe McCarthy and his methods.
Because this book was published in 1952, it does not tell the end of
the story &#8212; the Army-McCarthy hearings and the Senate's censure of McCarthy.

<i>Democracy Matters; Winning the Fight Against Imperialism</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Cornel West<br>

LC: JC423.W384 2004<br>
Dewey: 321.8 W516d 2004<br>
A great book. Gives about the clearest analysis that I've seen of the current predicament
and threats to the survival of our democracy. Also offers a higher, clearer, moral vision of
the future than I see anybody else offering.

<i>Sleeping With The Devil; How Washington Sold Our Soul For Saudi Crude</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Robert Baer<br>
Crown Publishers, New York, 2003.<br>
ISBN: 1-4000-5021-9<br>
Dewey: 327.538 B141s 2003<br>
Robert Baer is a former CIA agent who has a lot of expertise about the Middle East.
He has written a very disturbing and revealing book here, which basically says
that the days of the House of Sa'ud are numbered, and when it goes, so does our
dependable oil supply.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Baer says that the Saudi royal family is paying off the terrorists and extreme
Islamic fundamentalists to keep them from attacking the royal family, but that is
an &quot;end game&quot; &#8212; only a matter of buying time while the terrorist
organizations grow richer and more powerful, and the non-royal population of
the country becomes poorer and increasingly dissatisfied with the extravagant
profligate behavior of the <i>thousands</i> of high-living Saudi princes.
Baer says that there are 30,000 royals in Saudi Arabia, and they have
a population explosion problem: each prince has a dozen or two wives,
and many have 50 to 70 children, and all of the royal children expect and demand a
life of opulent luxury while the common people can't even get a job.
At that birth rate, in another generation, there could be many hundreds of thousands
of royals for the oil dole to support &#8212; and the money has actually already run out.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The hey-day when Saudi Arabia had more money than sand is gone. Now they are borrowing
money to keep the circus going.  Sooner or later, the situation will
become unstable and blow up. And Baer shows us many reasons why the time will
probably be sooner than later.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And yes, the money that financed the 9/11 attacks on the USA came from Saudi Arabia.
And the Washington politicians know it, or should know it,
but they are too busy taking big campaign contributions and other huge payoffs
from the Saudis to make a fuss about the situation in Saudi Arabia &#8212;
&quot;sleeping with the devil&quot;. But the times they are a'changin'.

<i>Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror</i>, Anonymous
&nbsp; &nbsp; <font color="#9F0000">(His real name is Mike Shoyer &#8212; he later
broke his anonymity.)</font><br>
Brassey's Inc., Washington, D.C., 2004.<br>
ISBN: 1-57488-849-8<br>
LC: HV6432.I47 2004<br>
Dewey: 973.931 I3445 2004 or 973.931&#8212;dc22<br>
A fascinating and disturbing book. The author, a CIA agent who prefered
to remain anonymous, makes a very good case for the USA being in big trouble
because of arrogance, ignorance, and stupidity in the highest offices.
He says that we do not clearly see our enemies because we insist on stereotyping
them and seeing them through Western eyes, rather than on their own terms.
What we call suicide bombers they call heroes who are going straight to Heaven.
The author says that our conduct of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq is so incompetent
and unrealistic that defeat is inevitable &#8212; that in Afghanistan, it has already happened.
Monumental hubris and insane arrogance led American leaders to think that
they could easily defeat, with just a few troops, a little precision bombing,
and a short war, the very Afghani freedom fighters who had just defeated the Soviet Army.
The Soviets had already learned the hard way that it isn't that easy,
but the arrogant Washington neo-Cons didn't listen, look, or learn.
This is a good book for those who are interested in current politics and the
&quot;war on terrorism&quot;.<br>
