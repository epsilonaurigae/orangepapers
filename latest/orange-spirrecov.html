There is quite a cottage industry of A.A. public relations hacks who
proselytize for A.A., while hiding their membership in A.A. and
pretending to just be neutral observers who cannot help but
notice that &quot;A.A. is wonderful for alcoholics...&quot;
They routinely plant pro-A.A. articles in magazines and journals.
<p>
The following article is all too typical of the pseudo-science that the A.A.
true believers are foisting on the public in the name of
informing the public about effective treatment for alcoholism.
This article pretends to show us how spirituality helps people to recover from
excessive alcohol use, but all it really does is try to sell us a lot of
Alcoholics Anonymous religious dogma, superstitions, and belief in
A.A. &quot;spirituality&quot;.

<h2> SPIRITUALITY: THE KEY TO RECOVERY FROM ALCOHOLISM</h2>
</center>

<p>

The authors suggest that a condition of &quot;negative spirituality&quot; underlies
and sustains alcoholism, and perhaps all addictions, and that a secure
recovery is not possible unless a &quot;spiritual awakening,&quot; such as is
envisioned by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), is achieved. A broadly applicable
conceptual model of spirituality is inferred from the AA 12-Step
rehabilitation program.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
&quot;Negative spirituality,&quot; huh? That's just as good as Scientology's
&quot;negative energy&quot; that infects MEST (Matter, Energy, Space-Time) and
screws up the world. Can demon-hunters or exorcists expel that negative spirituality?
How about <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>?
<p>
The authors are introducing A.A. cult beliefs very rapidly. We got three just in this
first paragraph. Besides the &quot;negative spirituality&quot;, we also got the
belief that &quot;a secure
recovery is not possible&quot; without a &quot;spiritual awakening.&quot;
William G. Wilson, one of the two co-founders of A.A., wrote this in the 'bible' of
Alcoholics Anonymous, the book also named <i>Alcoholics Anonymous,</i>, but popularly
called The <i>Big Book</i>:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit
entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the
amount you take, you are probably alcoholic. If that be the
case, you may be suffering from an illness which only a
spiritual experience will conquer.<br></font>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, page 44.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Neither The American Medical Association nor The American
Psychiatric Association
recognizes the existence of any disease which only a spiritual
experience will conquer,
but Alcoholics Anonymous does.
And, like the screwy Christian Science religion,
A.A. says that only God or a &quot;Higher Power&quot;
can cure that &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.

<p>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------
In the following couple of paragraphs, Mr. Wilson quickly changed his medical diagnosis
from &quot;you may be sick&quot; to &quot;you are going to die&quot;:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
To one who feels he is an atheist or agnostic such an experience seems
impossible, but to continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an
alcoholic of the hopeless variety.
To be doomed to an alcoholic death or to live
on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives to face. <br></font>

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, page 44.</font>
</blockquote>
<P>
--------------------------------------------------  -->

<p>
Then, the authors stated that <i>&quot;A broadly applicable
conceptual model of spirituality is inferred from the AA 12-Step
rehabilitation program.&quot;</i>
That sentence is loaded with implications:<br>

<ul>
<li> The Twelve Steps are &quot;spiritual&quot;. The
authors will never define spirituality, or tell us what it is,
or what it means to them;
they will try to just sort of infer some vague meaning from the Twelve Steps.
<li> The Twelve Steps are a rehabilitation program. The authors
will repeat this claim
all through this article, but will never support that claim
with any actual evidence.
<ul>
<li> The real evidence says that the Twelve Steps are a program for
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">converting people into
religious cult members</a>, not a program for recovery from
alcoholism.
<li> The real evidence says that Alcoholics Anonymous is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">a total failure as a rehabilitation program</a>.
</ul>
</ul>
</font>
<p>
<a name="rarely_fail"> </a>
Alcoholics Anonymous' &quot;Big Book&quot;
states, &quot;Rarely have we seen a person
fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are
people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple
program... &quot;(AA World Services, 1976, p. 58). The simple program referred
to is AA's twelve steps. They represent the actions taken by the founders
of AA to assure their own recovery from alcoholism. AA calls its twelve
steps a program of &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; (AA World Services, 1976, p. 60).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Yes, the authors are true believers, all right. They are quoting the
Alcoholics Anonymous <i>Big Book</i> as an authoritive tome on alcoholism.
Few professionals really do that, at least not in public,
because it is so stupidly and bombastically
written, not to mention the fact that it's
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">totally insane</a>.
And their choice of what to quote from the <i>Big Book</i> is a classic &#8212; it
is one of the worst paragraphs in the whole book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed
our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or
will not completely give themselves to this simple program,
usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of
being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates.
They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way.
They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner
of living which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are
less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave
emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if
they have the capacity to be honest.<br>
...<br>
At some of these [steps] we balked. We thought we could find an
easier, softer way. But we could not.<br>

</font></td></tr>
</table>

That is one of the biggest lies in the <i>Big Book</i>.
A.A. really has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">a failure rate that is between
95% and 100%</a>, but A.A. just blames all
of the victims, and says that they are all
&quot;constitutionally dishonest&quot;, and that the Twelve Step program is perfect &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The program never fails anyone, it is just
the alcoholics who fail the program.&quot;</i>
</font>
(==Popular A.A. slogan)
<p>
The original A.A. members did not discover that the
Twelve Steps worked to save alcoholics,
or that no &quot;easier, softer way&quot; would work. Bill Wilson's original
A.A. group had a horrendous relapse rate, one that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Wilson lied about</a>.
<p>
Like most typical cults, A.A. maintains that
its guru and founder, William Griffith ('Bill') Wilson,
and his teachings are without error and faultless,
and it's just everybody else in the world who is crazy and doesn't
understand, and who fails to live up to Bill's divinely-inspired
teachings and vast wisdom...
<p>
Lastly, the authors wrote:
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
The simple program referred
to is AA's twelve steps. They represent the actions taken by the founders
of AA to assure their own recovery from alcoholism. AA calls its twelve
steps a program of &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; (AA World Services, 1976, p. 60).
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, that is deceptive. The Twelve Steps are just a rewrite of
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">the recruiting and indoctrination
practices of Dr. Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups cult religion</a>. 
They are not the steps taken by the founders, because Bill Wilson didn't write
them until four years after he quit drinking. A.A. may call the steps &quot;a
program of spiritual awakening&quot;, but that isn't what they really are.

The Twelve Steps are better described as
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">a program of <i>religious conversion</i></a>,
or a program of <i>thought reform</i>
(<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">Dr. Robert J. Lifton's terminology</a>)
&#8212; something that brainwashes people into true believers in some cause.
</font>
<p>

THE AA REHABILITATION PROGRAM
<p>

Alcoholics Anonymous is both a fellowship and a rehabilitation program.
The fellowship provides alcoholics with a supportive peer group. It is
designed to instill in them the level of trust necessary to risk exposing
their vulnerable selves to honest examination and correction of their
dysfunctional behaviors and beliefs (Kurtz, 1979).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
And unfortunately, that trust, that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_instant_intimacy" target="_blank">cultish <i>instant
intimacy</i></a>,
makes it easy for
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">sexual predators and other
sick personalities</a> to take advantage of newcomers. Since A.A. sponsors
are not licensed or examined or held accountable for their actions
in any way whatsoever, it's always open season on the newcomers.
And since the newcomers who just quit drinking are still shaky,
confused, cloudy-headed, and vulnerable, the predators who want
fresh meat have an easy time of it.
</font>
<p>

It is the twelve step program, not the fellowship, which is primarily
responsible for the rehabilitation of the alcoholic
(AA World Services, 1976).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
They claim to be quoting from the <i>Big Book</i> again. The Twelve Steps
do the magic, huh, and not the fellowship? (Where? Which page says
that? I have never found a page in the <i>Big Book</i> that says that.)
Does that mean that we can all quit going to A.A. meetings now?
</font>
<p>

This study investigated the spiritual implications of AA's twelve step
program in an attempt to understand the value of spirituality in achieving
a secure recovery from alcoholism.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Calling this piece of preachy propaganda a &quot;study&quot; that
&quot;investigated&quot; something is really stretching the English
language.
</font>
<p>

A better understanding of AA
spirituality will aid those rehabilitation programs currently, but
ineffectively, employing the twelve steps (Booth, 1984a; Kohn, 1984). It
might also encourage recovering alcoholics to better use the AA program
and thereby reduce their risk of relapse.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
We are going to understand &quot;AA spirituality&quot;, are we?
It would help a lot if they would define their terms, and tell us what they
think spirituality actually is, but they don't. They just give us a lot of
vague handwaving and then hope that we will go along with it.
<p>
The authors complain that some Twelve-Step-based rehabilitation programs
are not pushing the spirituality enough? How can that be?
That sounds like an internal church problem to me.
<p>
The authors claim that if alcoholics &quot;better use the AA program&quot;,
it will &quot;reduce their risk of relapse.&quot;
Where is the evidence for that?
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific" target="_blank">Every good test
of A.A. has shown the opposite to be true</a>.
Even a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">proved that A.A.
treatment was totally ineffective and utterly useless</a>, when he did an
8-year-long test of A.A. treatment, <i>trying vainly to prove
that A.A. does work.</i> He found that A.A. had no better a recovery
rate than the usual rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics &#8212; which means that
A.A. didn't <i>make</i> anybody quit drinking &#8212;
but A.A. had a <i>much higher</i> death rate.
A.A. had the highest death rate of any treatment
program that he examined.
</font>

<p>
<a name="Gorski1"> </a>
Several studies reveal the success of AA in promoting recovery from
alcoholism (Bradley, 1988; Cook, 1988; Emerick, 1987; Hoffmann, Harrison &amp;
Belille, 1983; McLatchie and Lomp, 1988; Shereen, 1988; Thurstin, Alfano &amp;
Nerviano, 1987). Gorski and Miller, among the foremost of relapse
prevention specialists, asserted, &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is the single most
effective treatment for alcoholism&quot; (1986, p. 52).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
That's quite a list of references.
Lots of people agreeing that A.A. is perfect.
It is a shame that all of those studies and reports fall into
one of these categories:
<ul>
<li> The authors are also hidden members of this same A.A. boosters' club,
and their articles aren't any better, or any more truthful,
or any more scientific, than this pathetic piece of propaganda.
<li> They are being misquoted.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#test1" target="_blank">They are just flat-out totally wrong</a>.
Some of the reasons for this are:
<ul>
<li> The studies are methodologically flawed, and do
not measure what they purport to measure.
<li> There are no control groups, so the results are unclear,
or even meaningless.
<li> The so-called &quot;studies&quot; are merely the collected opinions
of some A.A. enthusiasts, not the results of valid tests of treatment programs,
or actual scientific experiments designed to test A.A.. (Again, what real
testing has been done has shown A.A. to be
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">completely ineffective, and even harmful</a>.)

<li> The authors accept anecdotal evidence or unsubstantiated
testimonials as proof of success.
</ul></ul>
<p>
The truth is, Alcoholics Anonymous is not an effective treatment
for alcoholism.
A.A. does not have a success rate.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">A.A. has a horrendous failure rate</a>,
one that is between 95 and 100 percent, depending on how you
count and measure things. Remember that the usual rate of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ftnt06" target="_blank">spontaneous remission
(&quot;self-healing&quot;) in alcoholics is approximately 5% per year</a>.
All of the apparent success stories of A.A. can be explained as mere
spontaneous remission &#8212; those people would have quit and recovered
anyway, without the cult religion.
</font>
<p>
<a name="unintended"> </a>
Nevertheless, relapse
(the unintended abuse of alcohol during recovery) even while involved with
AA is a distressingly common phenomenon (Blum, 1991). Stories of relapse
are often reported by alcoholics who claim to have been active in AA at
the time of relapse. Upon questioning, it is usually found that they
avoided step-work meetings and attended mostly large &quot;fellowship&quot; meetings
at which they could risk less self-exposure. Even for those who claim to
have had a &quot;sponsor&quot; to shepherd them through AA and its twelve steps,
little effort was made in this vital area.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
For once, some A.A. true believers admit that their organization has a horrible
relapse rate. Eventually, 99% or more of the people leave or relapse, but most
A.A. enthusiasts are in denial, and claim that there is no problem.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It's just weak, sinful people who fail the program.
There is <b>nothing</b> wrong with the program. RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail
who has thoroughly followed our path...&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
And note how the authors play &quot;blame the victim.&quot;
A.A. members supposedly relapsed because they didn't do the Steps properly,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;little effort was made in this vital area&quot;</font>.
Note that there is no supporting reference or footnote pointing
to any study that found that
the relapsers didn't do the Steps properly.
<ul>
<li> Where did that &quot;information&quot; come from?

<li> Who conducted what study, survey, or poll to discover what kinds of
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings the relapsers had been attending?

<li> Who &quot;usually found&quot; that <font color="#4f007f">the people
who relapsed had avoided the step-work kinds of A.A. meetings, and
&quot;attended mostly large 'fellowship' meetings at which they
could risk less self-exposure&quot;</font>?

<li> Who decided that &quot;risking self-exposure&quot; is necessary for recovery from alcoholism?<br>

<li> <font color="#9F0000">
So now it isn't enough to go to A.A. meetings all of the time, now we have to
attend just the <i>RIGHT KIND</i> of meetings?
</font>

<li> Who decided that working the Steps is <b><i>a vital area</i></b>?
</ul>

Or are they just taking Bill Wilson's word for it?
In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill hinted that you will relapse unless you
do his Twelve Steps:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.&quot;</i>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, page 72.)</font>
<p>
But Bill Wilson did not say that &quot;risking self-exposure&quot;
in the right kind of meetings was necessary for recovery from alcoholism.

<p>
And the authors' definition of relapse is funny, too:
<font color="#4f007f">
Relapse is &quot;the unintended abuse of alcohol
during recovery&quot;</font>.
<br>
What do you call the <i>intentional</i> use of alcohol during recovery?
Is it <i>not a relapse</i> if you really did <i>intend</i> to party your brains out?
Is intentionally buying a fifth of whiskey and guzzling it down not a relapse?

</font>

<p>
<b>Relapse Risk Factors in Alcoholism</b><br>
What is it about alcoholism that makes relapse such an ever-present risk?
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
People want to feel good. People have very long memories about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">what made them
feel good in the past</a>.
People tend to forget the negative details, and just remember the pleasure,
and they want to feel good again...
</font>
<p>

Khantzian and Mack (1989) referred to alcoholism as &quot;a complex disorder in
which problems of self-governance malignantly interact with other
vulnerabilities such as disabilities in regulating feelings (i.e.,
affects) and self-care to cause biologically susceptible individuals and
others to become hopelessly dependent on alcohol&quot; (pp. 79-80). This
definition recognizes the importance of personality and behavioral
characteristics that are subject to change (AA World Services, 1976;
Whitfield, 1984c) as well as biological and genetic factors for which
effective treatment has not yet been developed (Blum, 1991; May, 1988).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
That is quite a complex definition of alcoholism. What's the matter with,
<b>&quot;Alcoholism is habitually drinking far too much alcohol&quot;</b>?
<p>
They are splitting the blame for alcoholism between psychological
and biological/genetic
factors. No &quot;spiritual illnesses&quot; yet...
<p>
But we are getting plenty of other A.A. tenets:<br>
<ol>
<li> <font color="#4f007f"><i>Alcoholics &quot;become hopelessly
dependent on alcohol.&quot;</i></font>
That is the Step One &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; belief.

<li> <font color="#4f007f"><i>Alcoholics are &quot;biologically
susceptible individuals.&quot;</i></font>
That is the genetic factor. Alcoholics are supposedly born with a big problem.
Other people may be able to drink all they want,
but the situation for congenital alcoholics is &quot;hopeless&quot;.
<font color="#9F0000">
[Note that this is true for some alcoholics.]<br>
</font>
<li> <font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;...problems of self-governance malignantly interact with
other vulnerabilities...&quot;</i></font>
That means, alcoholics are incapable of running their own lives.
They were incapable even before they started drinking, because they
were born congenital alcoholics.
That is the other half of Step One: &quot;our lives had become unmanageable.&quot;
Alcoholics must have A.A. and their sponsor to run their lives for them,
they say.
</ol>
</font>

Alcoholics suffer from what AA calls &quot;character defects&quot; (AA World
Services, 1976, p. 59). These are feelings, beliefs, and behaviors that
dispose them to seek a sense of well-being by abusing alcohol. Such
&quot;character defects&quot; are frequently reflective of a pathological
narcissism, in which those addicted to alcohol behave as though they were
the center of their universe or their own God (Kurtz, 1979). Alcoholics
also possess an underlying codependency involving an alienation from their
true selves and an inability to establish functional relationships with
significant others in their lives (Whitfield, 1989). The combination of
these biological and character risk factors makes alcoholism difficult to
treat and makes the recovering alcoholic vulnerable to relapse.

This is nuts. This is just
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the standard A.A. stereotype
 of <i>&quot;The Alcoholic&quot;</i></a>.
It is quite untrue. The Alcoholics Anonymous cult founder and chief
guru Bill Wilson was one of the few people for whom it was
an accurate picture. And it really was an accurate picture of him.
He really did think that he was the center of his own universe,
or his own God.
He had a really bad case of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">delusions of grandeur,
or a narcissistic personality disorder</a>.
Bill was so crazy that he thought he was in psychic communication with
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Boniface" target="_blank">the spirits of dead priests</a>
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Nantucket" target="_blank">other dead people</a>,
and according to Henrietta Seiberling and Horace Crystal,
Bill ended up claiming that he was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Henrietta" target="_blank">the
reincarnation of Jesus Christ</a>.
Henrietta wrote of Bill, &quot;I don't know what
is going on in the poor deluded fellow's mind.&quot;

Bill Wilson's own psychiatrist, Dr. Harry Tiebout,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">
said of Bill Wilson</a>:
<font color="black">
&quot;he had been trying to live out the
infantilely grandiose demands of 'His Majesty the Baby.'&quot;</font>
So Bill Wilson fits the authors' stereotype.
<p>
The authors' wording here is both confusing and deceptive:
Alcoholics have &quot;character defects&quot; that are
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;feelings, beliefs, and behaviors that dispose them to seek a
sense of well-being by abusing alcohol.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Why not just speak plain old English and say that they feel bad, and
are trying to feel good?
Some of those alcoholics are desperate to feel good,
and they make the mistake of
thinking that more alcohol will make them feel better...
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
The authors are pulling
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">another bait-and-switch stunt</a>
on us here.
They just said, in the preceding paragraph, that alcoholism was caused by a genetic
factor. Now they are trying to tell us that alcoholism
is caused by &quot;character defects&quot; &#8212; i.e., immorality.
</font>

<p>
The authors use the term &quot;character defects&quot;
here to mean something like &quot;psychological factors&quot;
or &quot;mental factors.&quot;
Here, character defects are &quot;feelings, beliefs, and behaviors&quot;.
But Bill Wilson used the term &quot;character defects&quot;
in the <i>Big Book</i> as a synonym
for &quot;sin&quot;. Bill didn't want to publicly use the words
&quot;sin&quot; or &quot;confession&quot;
because that would have created conflicts with the Catholic Church, and
he would have lost all of the Catholic members.
(And it would have revealed just how intensely religious this
cult really is.)
So instead of &quot;confessing our sins&quot; while doing Steps
4 and 5, we make a
list of all of our &quot;defects of character&quot; and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
and then we &quot;admit ... the exact nature of our wrongs.&quot;
<p>
But note that when Bill Wilson wrote his next book,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
published in 1952, 13 years after the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill
reverted to using the words
&quot;sin&quot; and &quot;confession&quot; throughout the book:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
That is the measure of our character defects, or, if you wish,
of our sins.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 65.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The authors' use of the term &quot;character defects&quot; here is just
getting us accustomed to the term, before they pull a
psychological-to-moral bait-and-switch redefinition stunt on us.
By the time this article ends, &quot;character defects&quot; will
be more moral than psychological.
<p>
Then the authors continue their hateful assault on the
stereotypical alcoholic:
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Such 'character defects' are frequently reflective of
a pathological narcissism, in which those addicted to alcohol behave as
though they were the center of their universe or their own God.&quot;</b>
</font>
<p>
That was Bill Wilson's standard attack on alcoholics.
Bill Wilson practiced psychological projection a lot. He would
declare that all other alcoholics had the very character faults that he
himself exemplified, like
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">
delusions of grandeur</a> or a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
narcissistic personality disorder</a>,
and having an arrogant world-class inflated ego.
<p>
Note that, in just one sentence, the authors went from saying that
alcoholics feel bad, and want to feel good, to declaring that
<font color="#4f007f">
alcoholics
have &quot;a pathological narcissism&quot; and &quot;behave as
though they were the center of their universe or their own God.&quot;
</font>
There is actually no connection between those two things.
It really is possible to feel bad, and want to feel good, without
having delusions of grandeur and thinking that one is God.
<p>
As I said before,
Bill Wilson was the alcoholic who best exemplified the A.A.
stereotypical &quot;A.A. alcoholic&quot;.
Bill Wilson had a vicious self-contempt, and lots of hatred
and loathing of his own faults and shortcomings,
and he projected all of those faults onto an imaginary standard alcoholic.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">Bill routinely
taught contempt and hatred of that stereotypical alcoholic</a>.
Then Bill declared that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">We are all like
that</a>.&quot;
</font>

The authors, like so many other 12-Step-indoctrinated drug and alcohol
counselors, are just following Bill's teachings here.
<p>
That statement,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholics behave as though they are the center of their universe or
their own God&quot;</font>
is very standard, often-repeated Wilsonism.
And Wilson's next line was usually,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;And that sick ego thinks it is too big and too good to need God.&quot;
</font>
Those statements
are also part of the A.A. rationale for why the newcomer alcoholics'
egos, self-respect, and self-confidence have to be attacked and
destroyed.
Which, in turn, is part of why Alcoholics Anonymous is a harmful cult that
inflicts psychological damage on its members.
<p>
In the quote above, the authors also stated,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics also possess an underlying codependency&quot;...</i></font>
That is just another A.A. superstition &#8212;
just another phony non-existent disease like
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunk</a>&quot;</i>.
Neither the American Medical Association nor the American Psychiatric Association
recognize the existence of
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="_blank">any such disease or condition
as &quot;codependency&quot;</a>,
but A.A. does.

<p>
SOME SPIRITUAL IMPLICATIONS OF ALCOHOLISM
<p>
If alcoholism is to be effectively treated, the nature of well-being that
is sought by the alcohol abuser, no less than by all human beings, must be
understood. Well-being can be thought of as meeting one's basic needs.
Some might say it means satisfying our wants. But, as many rich and
&quot;successful&quot; people will agree, achieving our wants frequently results in
a dissatisfying quest for more and more wants. If we were created for a
positive purpose, and it makes little sense to think otherwise, satisfying
our basic needs should produce a state of well-being.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
That sure is a lot of fancy double-talk to avoid saying that people want to feel good,
and even need to feel good.
Note how the authors suggest that we should not get what we want, because we
will then only want more...

<p>
Funny how the authors slip a little religion in there, suggesting that &quot;we
were created for a positive purpose&quot;,
and &quot;it makes little sense to think otherwise.&quot;
Oh really?
So now these authors claim to know the Will and Purposes of Our Creator, God?
And it makes no sense to question their perceptions?
Isn't that just a little bit presumptuous?
<p>
What if God is an alien who
does not think in human terms at all?
Imagining that humans were created for a positive purpose is human logic, and might
not be God's way of thinking at all.
<p>
And, by the way, God definitely IS an
alien. He, She, or It is not native to the planet Earth, or even to the Milky Way Galaxy,
and probably not even to this Physical Universe... So it is very presumptuous and conceited to
imagine that God thinks like humans do.
It's the same old <i>&quot;God was created in Man's image&quot;</i> conceit.
<p>
If you want to just try to imagine how God
might think, try Kenneth Rexroth's line,
<font color="#007F00">&quot;Your words are inside out.&quot;</font>

</font>
<p>

What, then, are our basic needs? Glasser (1984) seemed to be largely on
target, with one exception, when he listed them as survival,
belongingness, power, freedom, and fun (or more correctly, pleasure). The
survival need, he said, is physical, but the concept could be broadened to
include possession of the means to function effectively in the world. The
other needs, he said, are psychological. In fact, with the exception of
power, which seems culture-bound and compensatory, all the other needs
seem to be spiritual in the broadest sense. It is highly likely that our
Creator endowed us with these needs for our spiritual development.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
There they go again. More strange religious nonsense.
Our &quot;basic needs&quot; are all &quot;spiritual in the broadest sense&quot;?
The authors' idea of what the word &quot;spiritual&quot; means seems to
change from one paragraph to the next.
And this is some strange theology: our
basic needs for belongingness, power, freedom, and pleasure help our
spiritual development? How?
Please define spiritual development.
Most preachers say that the pursuit of pleasure hinders spiritual development.
</font>
<p>

Therefore, no less than for the rest of us, the quest of the alcoholic is
for spiritual well-being.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
What incredible bull. The quest is for a pleasant buzz, to feel good.
<p>

The only people who are really on a quest for &quot;spiritual
well-being&quot; through chemicals are the users of LSD and other
psychedelics. Acid can sometimes, if you are lucky and prepared,
and in the right place at the right time, give you some very profound
spiritual experiences. Alcohol never does. In fact, it is only alcohol
withdrawal, not drinking, that comes even close. The hallucinations
of <i>delirium tremens</i> will get you a lot closer to a spiritual
state than alcohol ever will.
</font>
<p>

Of all the basic needs--survival, belongingness,
freedom, and pleasure--the most spiritual is belongingness, which can be
described as enjoyment of loving, accepting, and trusting relationships
with one's self, other people, the world in all aspects of life
experiences, life itself, and the God of one's understanding. These
relationships seem to be the primary means of achieving well-being for
alcoholics and for us all.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Oh? They never defined just what spirituality was, remember?
They hinted that we would better understand it, and then they didn't
define it. Now we are told that wanting to belong to a group and have
trusting relationships is
&quot;spiritual&quot;. Not social or psychological?
This is ridiculous.
<p>
Of course it is social. And the drive to socialize is
one of the basic human instincts. We have few genuine instincts, but the urge to
socialize is one of them. We are intensely tribal animals. Solitary confinement is
torture for a human.
<p>
Fish swim in
schools, birds flock, horses herd, and so do cows, buffalo, antelope, gazelles, elephants,
and on and on. And monkeys and humans live together in tribes.
And a big part of our psychology
relates to our social relationships:
getting status in the tribe, competing with others of
our own sex for mates, cooperating with other tribe members
for our mutual survival,
trading favors... And our need to belong to the tribe is certainly intense.
Teenagers, in particular, really go bananas over social acceptance
and being one of the gang. To be rejected,
ostracized, and exiled from the tribe is often a fate worse than death.
To declare that our most &quot;spiritual&quot; basic need is
&quot;belongingness&quot;
is not just wrong, it is just plain stupid. The need for companionship is psychological,
and it's social,
but it isn't &quot;spiritual&quot;. Again, the authors cannot seem to
figure out what the word &quot;spirituality&quot; really means.
</font>
<p>
<a name="holistic"> </a>
Alcoholism is best understood and treated holistically (Wegscheider,
1981). It affects every aspect of the human condition. Abuse of alcohol
damages a person physically, mentally, emotionally, socially, and
spiritually.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Yes, that is the standard A.A. party line, &quot;the patient
must be treated physically, mentally, and spiritually.&quot; And the best
&quot;spiritual&quot; treatment program always involves
<a href="orange-coffee.html#recproc" target="_blank">sending the patient to
A.A. or N.A. meetings for the &quot;spiritual benefits&quot;</a>.
(I guess the second-best treatment
program would be some other cult religion, like The Church of Scientology,
which also claims that its courses and &quot;auditing&quot; of
members causes &quot;spiritual&quot; benefits.)
<p>
Note how the Steppers hijack the term &quot;holistic healing&quot;
and use it to mean,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You also have to treat the 'spiritual' dimension of people by
sending them to A.A. meetings and making them do the Twelve Steps.&quot;
</font>
</font>

<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
The central element in holistic healing is spirituality
(Chandler, Holden, &amp; Kolander, 1992; Witmer &amp; Sweeney, 1992).
Unfortunately for the alcoholic, it is the spiritual aspect of well-being
that is usually overlooked or deemphasized in most treatment programs.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
That is a very funny complaint to be making:
<i>&quot;the spiritual aspect of well-being
... is usually overlooked or deemphasized in most treatment programs.&quot;</i>
Funny, considering that <i>at least</i>
90% of all of the treatment programs in the USA are based on the Twelve Steps.
(The National Treatment Center Study conducted by the University of Georgia
found that 93 percent of the more than 400 representative alcohol treatment
programs surveyed were based on the twelve steps of
AA.<sup><font size="-2"><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></font></sup>)
So they should be <i>very spiritual</i>. What is the matter with all of the Alcoholics
Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous members who run those treatment programs?

<p>
What are the authors really saying here? What are they campaigning for?
Do they want us to support a law that demands that <i>all</i> treatment programs
teach the <i>Spirituality of the Twelve Steps</i>? Are they really getting that
upset over the tiny percentage of treatment programs that are not based
on the Twelve Steps?
</font>
<p>

The reason appears to be both a lack of 'understanding of the role of
spirituality in rehabilitation and a reluctance to become involved in what
is presumed to be religion' (Booth, 1984a; Kohn, 1984).

<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Excuse me, but we haven't even established that the A.A. and N.A. members who
run the treatment programs <i>are not</i> shoving cult religion down the throats of
the patients.
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_mind_control" target="_blank">
They usually do that, you know</a>.
The Twelve-Step true believers work at counselling jobs in those treatment programs
just so that they can convert patients into members of their Twelve-Step religion.
So it is absurd to be looking for the cause of why the 12-Step counselors
<i>are not doing it.</i>
</font>
<p>
The result is an incomplete and relapse-prone recovery for the alcoholic.

Carl Jung observed of one of his patients, &quot;his craving for alcohol was
the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of our being for
wholeness, expressed in medieval language: the union with God&quot; (cited in
Sikorsky, 1990, p. 14). Did he mean that spirituality is the same as what
we today call religion? Probably not; for the more prominent thinkers of
medieval times religion encompassed all aspects of life, both sacred and
worldly (Moore, 1992). This broad view of spirituality is similar to that
recognized by Booth (1984b) and Whitfield (1984a) as the essential but
largely missing element in alcoholism treatment.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This is a bunch of ludicrous double-talk. The authors have no idea whether
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Carl_Jung" target="_blank">Carl Jung</a> was hair-splitting and
yammering the A.A. line,
&quot;it's spiritual, not religious.&quot; They just wish he had.
And poor Carl was pretty addled in his old age: He praised the
spirituality of the Nazi movement, and allowed himself to be used
in radio programs that bragged about the spirituality of the Aryan
race and the racial purity programs, breeding tall, blond-haired,
blue-eyed Germans for Heinrich Himmler's SS... And Jung said that Jews and
women were inherently dishonest and spiritually inferior...
So it's hard to guess exactly what Carl Jung might have meant by
&quot;spirituality.&quot;

<p>
Again, how can their much-vaunted &quot;spirituality&quot; be
&quot;largely missing&quot; from alcoholism treatment when A.A.
totally dominates and controls the alcoholism treatment field? How
can the authors possibly think they have something to complain about?
</font>
<p>

Spirituality is concerned with whomever or whatever is most important in a
person's life (George, 1990).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
They really do make some ridiculous statements, don't they?
Their description of &quot;spirituality&quot; is becoming less and less clear.
It seems to be everything to everybody:
<ul>
<li>
If someone is obsessed
with getting more money, and that is the most important thing in his life,
are his money-grubbing habits &quot;spirituality&quot;?
<li>
<font color="#CF0000">Were the Enron executives &quot;spiritual&quot;
when they defrauded the public and stole all of their employees'
retirement funds? Why not? Enriching themselves seems to have been
the most important thing in their lives...</font>
<li>
What about a compulsive sex fiend? Are his sexual practices &quot;spirituality&quot;?
Why not, when they are the most important thing in his life?
</ul>

</font>
<p>

Essentially, spirituality involves attitudes
that are based on beliefs about our relationships with our self, with
other human beings, with our world (including our physical and social
environments), with life (as to its meaning and purpose), and ultimately,
with God, a Higher Power, or &quot;Universal Consciousness&quot; (Whitfield, 1984a).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This description of &quot;spirituality&quot; is just a mixture of psychology
and religion. What is the difference between my &quot;religious&quot;
view and my &quot;spiritual&quot; view of my relationship with God?
<p>
The answer is: &quot;There isn't any difference.&quot; There is no firewall
separating religion and spirituality. In A.A.,
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">it is all cult religion</a>, period, in spite
of the constantly-repeated slogan about how
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">It's spiritual, not
religious</a>.&quot;
<p>
When you strip off the excess verbosity, the authors are saying,
&quot;spirituality involves attitudes&quot;.
What is so spiritual about having an attitude?
</font>
<p>

If those beliefs were formed in circumstances of unconditional love,
acceptance, and trust, we probably exhibit attitudes of unconditional
love, acceptance, and trust in all of our relationships. Prezioso called
this positive spirituality, which, he said, reflects, &quot;a sense of
gratitude and acceptance, a sense of connectedness with others and with a
benevolent power greater than self. .. anchored in the belief that life
has meaning and purpose and that, although imperfect, each of us is
acceptable, lovable, and worthwhile&quot; (1987, p. 239).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Meaning: if you weren't an abused child, you will have a better, more positive
attitude towards life in general. That is hardly a great discovery...
Prezioso may have called this &quot;positive spirituality&quot; but that doesn't make it so.
It isn't spirituality at all, it's just good psychology, and the proper,
loving way to raise children, giving them good attitudes about themselves, life,
and everything.
<p>
Note that the authors never used the word &quot;childhood&quot;. They just
said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If those beliefs were formed in circumstances of unconditional
love...&quot;</font>

Well, early childhood is when all of our attitudes about life, the Universe, and
everything are formed. A child has formed his or her basic core personality by the
age of four. If you treat them good during those years, then they get a positive attitude
towards life and their relationships with other people, and they feel good about themselves
too. But if you abuse them and mistreat them during those years, then they come out
of those first four years bitter and angry, resentful and hateful, and have very negative
attitudes towards themselves and other people.
They become callous and
unfeeling, and cannot be compassionate or considerate of other people's feelings.
It is very difficult for them to even feel good.
And it is extremely difficult to change those feelings later.
<p>
It's just like baby birds imprinting the image of &quot;mother&quot;.
The baby birds just think that the first big moving thing they see
after they hatch out is their mother, and they memorize the picture of it.
Once the baby birds imprint, it's impossible to change their minds. Some
researchers did a goofy experiment once: They fooled baby birds into thinking that
ping-pong balls were their mothers, because ping-pong balls were the first big moving
thing that the birds saw after they hatched out. And those poor birds spent the rest
of their lives pushing around ping-pong balls... Let us hope that we are not just as
blind about some of our imprinting.
</font>
<p>

When we experience positive spirituality, we tend to view ourselves as
lovable, capable, and deserving. We allow others to enter and enrich our
lives without feeling a need to manipulate, use, or abuse them. We find
our world (job, school, community) to be a largely safe place wherein we
are able to develop toward our full potential. Life has positive meaning
and purpose, and many of us find a loving God who guides our lives, shares
our joys, and sustains us when we are in pain or in need. When positive
spirituality dominates our lives, we have no need to alter our moods with
addictive substances or behaviors.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Again, meaning: if you weren't an abused child, you will have a better, more positive
attitude towards life in general.
<p>
The authors claim that many of us will find a loving God because we weren't
abused children? I suppose there is some truth to that. Those children are less
likely to believe that a hateful, malicious God runs the Universe. But that
isn't &quot;spirituality&quot;, that's just somebody's opinion...
And it is true that when you feel good, you have less need to make yourself
feel good by using drugs or alcohol, but that isn't spirituality either.
That's just very simple logic, a truism. If you already feel good, then you
don't need to make yourself feel good.
</font>
<p>

The opposite is true for active alcoholics and sober but nonrecovering
alcoholics referred to in AA as &quot;dry drunks.&quot; Their lives are dominated by
a negative spirituality (Prezioso, 1987). They are insecure, defensive,
and lacking in self-esteem. They try to fill their unmet relationship
needs by using and abusing others whom they fear and distrust. They see
the world as unsafe and use that as justification for conning and
manipulating their way through it. Life for them is not only devoid of
positive purpose; to quote an often-heard comment, &quot;Life sucks, and then
you die.&quot;
And the god, if any, of their understanding is either harsh and
unforgiving or has no relevance to them.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Meaning: if you were an abused child, you will have a bad, negative
attitude towards life in general. That is hardly a great discovery...
And, like before, Prezioso calls this &quot;negative spirituality&quot;,
but it still isn't &quot;spirituality.&quot; It's just simple, every-day psychology.

<p>
According to the authors' logic, positive or negative &quot;spirituality&quot;
is basically the kind of mind-set or attitude towards life that
comes from being loved or abused as a child...
So what is the difference between the authors'
ideas of &quot;spirituality&quot; and a psychologist's concepts of &quot;outlook on life&quot;
or &quot;attitude towards life&quot;?
Apparently none.
It would appear that this idea of
&quot;spirituality&quot; is quite unnecessary, and can be replaced
with simple non-supernatural psychological terms.
<p>
But the term &quot;a positive approach to life&quot; doesn't
sound nearly as grandiose
and ego-pleasing as &quot;positive spirituality&quot;, does it?
Apparently, the authors and also
a lot of A.A. members like to think that God really cares
whether they are in a good
mood or not... And they like to imagine that they are getting
closer to God by being
cheerful. &#8212; Now actually, there might be something to that.
I won't challenge that
attitude, because it has a ring of truth to it. You are
certainly distancing yourself
from God by being hateful. But isn't all of this yammering
about &quot;spirituality&quot;
just a big self-congratulatory ego trip? Isn't it just the
kind of egotism that Bill Wilson
and A.A. hate, or claim to hate, and insist must be destroyed?
<p>
And note how the authors slipped
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the standard A.A. negative stereotype</a> of
<i>The Alcoholic</i> into that paragraph:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They see the world as unsafe and use that as justification for
conning and manipulating their way through it. Life for them is ...
devoid of positive purpose&quot;...
</font><br>
The majority of alcoholics are not like that. In fact, the majority of alcoholics eventually
quit drinking, and the vast majority of the successful quitters
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
do it by themselves</a>, without A.A. or any other treatment program,
precisely because they have a positive view of life and believe that life is worth living.
<p>


<p>
How can you possibly be &quot;sober but nonrecovering&quot;
when alcohol was the thing that was killing you, and you aren't drinking it any more?<br>
Simple:
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">A.A. redefines the word
&quot;recovery&quot;</a> to mean
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;doing the Twelve
Steps, going to A.A. meetings, and abstaining from drinking alcohol&quot;.</font>
<p>
Also note how the authors managed to slip in that imaginary A.A.
bogeyman, the
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunk</a>&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#DF0000">
&quot;sober but nonrecovering alcoholics
referred to in AA as 'dry drunks.'&quot;<br>

The A.A. true-believer cult members say that you will turn into a
bitterly unhappy <i>dry drunk</i> if you quit drinking alcohol without
practicing Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps. There is absolutely no
scientific or medical evidence to support that statement.
There is no such thing as a
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#dry_drunk" target="_blank">dry drunk</a>, the
way that A.A. describes it.
The <i>&quot;dry drunk&quot;</i> story is just more cult-religion
dogma &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Those people who don't belong to our religion and do our
practices are bad. They are seeking an easier, softer way.&quot;<br>
</font>

That is also some
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank"><i>Phobia Induction</i></a>,
another standard practice of cult religions. Cults say:
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;If you don't join our cult and
follow all of our rules, then you will go insane, or Satan will get
you, or some other really nasty thing will happen to you.&quot;</font><br>
In the case of Alcoholics Anonymous, the story is, of course, that your fate
is &quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot; if you won't do it the A.A. way.

<p>
So the authors say:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;sober but nonrecovering
alcoholics, referred to in AA as 'dry drunks,' [have] lives ... dominated by
a negative spirituality...&quot;</i><br>
</font>

They maintain that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You won't recover&quot;</font>, and 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Your life will be dominated by negative spirituality&quot;</font>
if you don't join A.A. and do Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps (which he actually got from
the fascist minister <a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr.
Frank Buchman</a>).
<p>
And some people still claim that Alcoholics Anonymous is
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">not an irrational cult religion</a>...
</font>
<p>

Nevertheless, they seem to be
constantly striving to realize the joys of positive spirituality, albeit
through a substitute relationship with alcohol.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
They are trying to get a buzz on and feel good, you idiot.
</font>
<p>

Unfortunately, their strivings are doomed to failure because the relationship with alcohol is
unnatural and the problems alcohol abuse creates causes them increasing
unhappiness.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Excuse me? This just gets better and better. The last time I heard that
&quot;unnatural relationship&quot; rap was in a denunciation of homosexuality by a rabid
right-wing hatemonger fundamentalist Christian minister... You know, one of those
TV evangelists...
So now alcoholics have &quot;unnatural relationships&quot; with their bottles?
<p>
So what position constitutes a &quot;natural relationship&quot; with a bottle?

<p>
And of course alcohol has bad side effects, and if you drink too much it
makes you feel sick. We figured that out for ourselves...

<p>

A NEW LOOK AT AA'S SPIRITUAL REHABILITATION MODEL
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
(Excuse me, but what was the &quot;old look&quot;?)
</font>
<p>

As the human personality develops from a preoccupation with the survival,
passion, and power needs of its "lower self," toward the understanding,
compassion, and unity strivings of its higher self (Whitfield, 1984a,
1984b), it also grows spiritually.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This is really beautiful flowery talk. Please prove it.
And please define &quot;spiritual growth.&quot; To Bill Wilson, it meant
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#going_insane" target="_blank">brainwashing yourself</a>
into being a good A.A. cult member. What's your definition?
</font>
<p>

<a name="transcend_lower"> </a>
As the lower self is transcended,
life's relationships become more fulfilling. Without that transcendence,
life's relationships are predominately troublesome.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
More Bull. And it is all a big gnostic heresy: The belief that
survival, life, sex, and the
need for control over one's own life is all evil. Everything down here
on Earth is dirty and evil, and the domain of Satan, and the only goodness to be
found is in Heaven. &#8212; That's a gnostic heresy.
<p>
The authors treat the idea of &quot;the lower self&quot; the same way.
They claim that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the human personality develops from a preoccupation with the
survival, passion, and power needs of its 'lower self'...&quot;</font>
<ul>
<li> Is that everybody's personality, or only
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the stereotypical sicko alcoholics</a>?<br>
<li>
Who defines how much interest or attention amounts to &quot;preoccupation&quot;?
<li>
If you get hungry and horny, are you &quot;preoccupied&quot; with the &quot;lower self&quot;?
<li>
Why does this sound suspiciously like shaming and guilt induction?
<ul>
<li>
Are we supposed to be ashamed of our bodies, or at least the lower half of them?<br>
<li>
Are we supposed to be ashamed of our sexuality?<br>
<li>
Are we supposed to feel guilty if we enjoy sex with a beautiful mate?<br>
<li>
Is there something low and wrong about us if we concern ourselves with our survival?
</ul>

<li> And the lower self must be transcended? Can't you be a good person, and
still have a lower self, and still do things like eat and live and have a sex life?
</ul>
<p>
The authors claim:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;As the lower self is transcended, life's relationships
become more fulfilling.
Without that transcendence, life's relationships are predominately
troublesome.&quot;</i><br>
</font>

Where is the evidence for those pseudo-psychological or pseudo-religious
statements?<br>
There is none.<br>
There wasn't even a footnote or a reference to a study.<br>
There aren't even any suitable people to study &#8212;
Show me even 100 people who have actually &quot;transcended&quot;
the &quot;lower self&quot;.<br>
This is just psycho-babble nonsense. The authors are just running
off at the mouth, engaging in wishful thinking.

<p>
The authors leave us no elbow room in their absolute attitudes here. It seems that
all alcoholics are automatically evil and &quot;preoccupied&quot; with the bad, lower self.
It doesn't seem to matter how much or how little attention they pay to sex or survival...
They are preoccupied with the &quot;survival, passion, and power needs&quot;
of their &quot;lower self&quot; because the authors say they are, and only joining
the authors' religion and experiencing &quot;spiritual growth&quot; in
the Twelve-Step program will save them from sex and survival.
</font>
<p>

Maslow (1954) held
that psychological illnesses occur when the attainment of the higher
nature of the individual becomes blocked. For alcoholics, mainly because
of attitudes of negative spirituality, relationships with self, others,
the world, life, and God are unsatisfactory. Indeed, they are primary
sources of stress, which initiate and prolong alcohol abuse.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Meaning, abused children are messed up in the head. We already knew that, and
it doesn't take any vague superstitious concepts of
&quot;negative spirituality&quot; to explain the phenomenon.
</font>
<p>

Most alcoholics began drinking abusively in their teens.

Wrong again. Completely untrue. (These authors just don't seem to
know anything about anything, do they?)
Real people begin drinking excessively at
all ages.
The authors are just stupidly repeating the standard
A.A. stereotype of <i>The Alcoholic</i> again.
There are, in fact, two classic types of alcoholic:
<ol>
<li> First, there is the teenage drunk, the high school lush.
They often start drinking at 13 and are in big trouble with
alcohol by 20. They tend to be the violent, wild and crazy
shooting stars. (Shooting stars burn out fast.)
<li> Then there is the middle-aged alcoholic. They often don't
even start drinking much until age 30, and then their drinking slowly but
steadily increases until they are drinking so much that
their lives are in danger.
</ol>

<p>
Even the <i>Big Book</i> says:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;My drinking did not start until after I was thirty-five, and a
fairly successful career had been established. At first it was just
... an occasional drink.&quot;<br></font>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,

3rd Edition page 374 and 4th Edition page 349.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<p>
Likewise, Bill Wilson didn't start drinking until he was in
his twenties, a young lieutenant in the Army on the eve of World
War One.<sup><font size="-1"><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></font></sup>
<p>

And the <i>Big Book</i> also says:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">

</blockquote>
<p>
So much for the stereotyping statement that most alcoholics start drinking
abusively in their teen years.
</font>
<p>

From that point,
alcohol became their method for coping with stress, and they apparently
failed to develop much beyond the adolescent personality stage. The twelve
step rehabilitation program of AA helps to complete that personality
development process.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
More total bull. People who began drinking heavily much later in life
do not need to relive their teenage years. And they are not stuck at
&quot;the adolescent personality stage.&quot;
This is still just more of the same old stupid A.A. stereotype of
<i>The Alcoholic</i>.
<p>
The Twelve-Step &quot;rehabilitation program&quot; of AA helps to
make people into cult members, period.  The Twelve Steps help to
destroy people's personalities.
The bible of Alcoholics Anonymous, the <i>Big Book</i>, even says
that explicitly:
<ul>
<li> Page 420 (3rd Edition), in the story titled <i>&quot;Growing Up All Over Again&quot;</i>:
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;In A.A., I have had to be
torn down and then put back together differently.&quot;</font>
<li> Page 459 (3rd Edition):
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;All Twelve Steps of A.A. are designed to kill the
old self (deflate the old ego) and build a new, free self.&quot;</font>
</ul>
<p>
The twelve step &quot;rehabilitation program&quot; of AA <i>does not</i>
help to complete any personality development process other than
brainwashing and cult conversion. The &quot;new, free self&quot;
that will be built is actually a slave, someone who is
&quot;<b><i>totally dependent</i></b>&quot;
on A.A. and its &quot;Will of God.&quot; The authors will clearly
say that a little later. Bill Wilson repeatedly bragged that
<a href="orange-not_good.html#dependency" target="_blank">his program
made people dependent upon Alcoholics Anonymous</a>, that Alcoholics
Anonymous was just a substitute addiction.
Read on for <a href="#totally_dependent">the gory details</a>.
</font>

<p>
It also instills attitudes of positive spirituality,
which will allow recovering alcoholics to deal effectively with the
stresses of life and bring about a fulfilling and even joyful recovery.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
The twelve step &quot;rehabilitation&quot; program of AA unfortunately
helps to instill a nasty tendency to become neurotic,
to engage in
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank">uncontrolled
binge drinking</a>, and sometimes even
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds_suicide" target="_blank">to commit suicide</a>.
</font>
<p>

It does so by promoting the growth of a healthy ego in a nurturing
environment.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
The Twelve Steps destroy egos, they don't nurture them.
The authors have written, even in this very article, that the purpose
of the Twelve Steps is to &quot;deflate&quot; the egos of new A.A.
recruits.
And if by a
&quot;nurturing environment&quot;, they mean A.A. meetings,
they've got to be joking.
<ul>

really graphic descriptions of the &quot;nurturing environment&quot;.<br>
<li> Read
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">

<li> And read Ken Ragge's excellent description of

<i>More Revealed</i>.<br>

<li> Check out
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">
a few more stories of sexual predators</a> in &quot;the rooms&quot;.<br>

tell the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous or the Twelve Steps or
Bill Wilson, because they don't want to hear it...
</ul>

</font>
<p>
<a name="transcendence"> </a>
According to Khantzian and Mack, &quot;The spiritual dimension of AA helps to
move a person from a less mature, childish self-centeredness toward a more
mature form of object love&quot; (1989, p. 79). Essentially, the founders of AA
understood that the transcendence of ego stimulates in the alcoholic a
corresponding growth of positive spirituality.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
The authors just really lay it on, don't they?
<ul>
<li> Father Wilson will make the children be good.
Again, they will fix the stereotypical &quot;childish&quot; alcoholic
with the Twelve Steps by damaging the ego, not transcending it.
Destroying people's self-respect and making them wallow
in guilt, and making them admit that they are powerless, insane, weak,
stupid, flawed, defective, immoral, and guilty of everything
is not &quot;transcending the ego.&quot; It is <i>the induction of guilt,
and the use of guilt to manipulate people's minds.</i>

<li> And such psychological abuse surely does not induce a
&quot;corresponding growth of positive spirituality.&quot;<br>

<li> And no matter what Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob thought they
&quot;understood&quot;, they still didn't really get any better success
rate than
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank"><i>no treatment at
all</i></a>.
</ul>

</font>
<p>

The process duplicates, in
part, the early childhood and subsequent relationship influences intended
to promote positive spiritual development in us all but which often fall
short of the mark.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This is insane. Note that none of this happy hype about what great things
the Twelve Steps will do for you is even supported by a reference or a footnote.
It's all just grandiose hand-waving and wild generalizations,
unsupported by any facts. The authors are just repeating the grandiose,
bombastic, delusional sermons of William G. Wilson.
If the Twelve Steps really duplicate early childhood, then the
unfortunate members whose
early childhoods are being duplicated really were abused
children, weren't they?
Abused children with crazy fundamentalist cult religion
preachers for parents...
</font>
<p>

AA also serves as a kind of surrogate family to provide
alcoholics with consistent unconditional love, trust, and acceptance,
coupled with reality-testing and a respectful amount of direction and
guidance.

This is just such incredible bull. The neurotic true-believer cult members
of A.A. are hardly what you would call a surrogate family with consistent
unconditional love, trust, and acceptance... Just see
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">how unconditionally they love
you and accept you</a> if you criticize
Bill Wilson or the Twelve Steps...
<p>
Hint: They are a bunch of alcoholics with messed-up personalities,
remember?
They are incapable of unconditionally loving anyone.
The authors just told us that.
According to the authors, they are all full of &quot;negative
spirituality.&quot;
Putting two dozen of them together in a room doesn't just
suddenly magically fix them,
so they will still be shoving all of their various &quot;character
defects&quot; and other negative mind games on each other.
There are far too many horror stories of
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">sexual predators and crazy
control freaks</a> in those rooms.
Don't expect any &quot;unconditional love, trust, and
acceptance&quot; from them.

Although AA exerts no pressure on alcoholics to change, it provides
every encouragement and assistance necessary for them to do so if
they are willing, open-minded, and capable of being honest with
themselves and others.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Baloney. Of course there is pressure to change, lots of pressure.
Immense pressure. That's how the game works.
<ul>
<li> Do you think they congratulate people for drinking?
<li> Do you think they praise people who don't parrot the party line?

<h2>The Twelve Steps</h2>
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Now the authors list the Twelve Steps. The true believers just love to
reprint the Twelve Steps at every possible opportunity. One of the
hallmarks of this A.A.-booster school of literature is that they find
some excuse to reprint the Twelve Steps in their article.
Sometimes, they even include The Twelve Traditions and the
Serenity Prayer, too, just to make sure that we get
<i><b>The Message</b></i>. (Step Twelve specifically commands members
to &quot;carry the message&quot; to others, so that's
what the authors are doing to us.)
</font>

<p>
A listing of the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and their
implications for ego-transcendence and positive spiritual development is
found in the publication <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>
(AA World Services, 1952).

sermons</a> that Bill Wilson wrote 13 years after
he wrote the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>. By then, Bill's
madness was complete, and he just raved hateful insane negative stuff
about alcoholics and human nature for
192 pages, while going through a bout of deep, crippling,
clinical depression that lasted for eleven years.

Most professional psychologists or drug and alcohol rehabilitation
counselors avoid quoting <b>12x12</b> in public, because it is
practically impossible to then declare that A.A. isn't a religion.

Words like &quot;God, Higher Power, sin, guilt, blame, faults,
defects, pride, greed, lust, sex, anger, gluttony, envy, sloth,
moral shortcomings, defects of character, or confession&quot; appear
on almost every page.
</font>

<p>
The steps are introduced as follows, accompanied by
interpretations provided by the authors of this study.
<p>

<a name="transcend_ego"> </a>
<a name="willful_ego"> </a>
<b> Step 1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol--that our lives had
become unmanageable.</b><br>

The &quot;self-centeredness&quot; of a willful and
irresponsible ego is recognized as the root cause of the destructive use
of alcohol, and dependence on self-confidence or willpower in its
treatment is seen as a &quot;total liability&quot; (AA World Services, 1952, p. 22).
Acceptance of being &quot;powerless&quot; prepares the groundwork for the eventual
transcendence of the narrow ego-self.

<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Excuse me, but it doesn't say that at all. Step One said that we were powerless over alcohol,
and that our lives had become unmanageable.
It said nothing about us being self-centered.
<p>
Those lines that follow Step One are ostensibly quotes from
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, but the line:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The &quot;self-centeredness&quot; of a willful and
irresponsible ego is recognized as the root cause of the destructive use
of alcohol<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
is not present on page 22 of the book
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
Something like the second half of that statement &#8212;
<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
... dependence on self-confidence or willpower in its
treatment is seen as a &quot;total liability&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

&#8212; is present:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence.
Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned,
it was a total liability.
Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a mental obsession
so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 22.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(&quot;Our sponsors&quot; declared that,
but &quot;our sponsors&quot; were dead wrong.)
</font>
<p>

Those statements are
very revealing, because they show how Wilson and his followers will
twist things around, and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#alice" target="_blank">make the words mean whatever
they want them to mean</a>.
<p>
Step One said <i>nothing, absolutely nothing</i> about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;a willful and
irresponsible ego is recognized as the root cause of the destructive use
of alcohol.&quot;</font><br>
<p>
And Step One said <i>nothing, absolutely nothing</i> about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;dependence on self-confidence or willpower in its
treatment is seen as a 'total liability'.&quot;</font>
<p>
Both of those statements are completely false.
The statement that dependence on self-confidence or willpower
is seen as a &quot;total liability&quot; is just laying the
groundwork for demanding that
you surrender your mind and your will to the cult and let someone
else order you around and do your thinking for you.
Likewise, &quot;acceptance of being powerless&quot; prepares
the ground for the eventual surrender to the cult, not for the
transcendance of ego, like the authors claim. Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer
listed
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt,
and dependency&quot;</font>
as one of the
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">
five essential conditions for successful brainwashing</a>, and the constantly-parroted
statements that you are powerless over alcohol accomplish the 'powerlessness' part of
it. (And steps four through ten accomplish the guilt part &#8212; constantly listing
and confessing all of your sins.
And the 'covert fear' part is accomplished through
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank"><i>Phobia Induction</i></a>
&#8212; constantly telling people that
they will relapse and die a horrible death if they don't &quot;work the Steps&quot;, and
conform to the A.A. program, and do everything their sponsor says.
Likewise, new members are made dependent on A.A.
for everything from their self-respect to their self-confidence.)


<p>
According to the A.A. cult dogma, you can not, <b><i>you absolutely
must not</i></b>, depend on yourself and just quit drinking.
If you do, then you won't need them. Plus, you will set an
example they don't want the
beginners to see: sane, sober, cult-free, guilt-free, self-reliance.
Happy recovery without any cult religion, which is supposed to be impossible.
Wilson also wrote, on that page in &quot;12x12&quot;,
<p>
<a name="singlehanded"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Few indeed were those who, so assailed, had ever won through
in singlehanded combat. It was a statistical fact that alcoholics
almost never recovered on their own resources. And this had been
true, apparently, ever since man had first crushed grapes.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
That is a lie &#8212; a complete, total, deliberate, bare-faced lie &#8212; a lie intended to fool
people into thinking that they cannot live without the A.A. cult.
Most people who recover from alcoholism
do it alone, without any treatment program or support group or any
other cult religion &quot;help&quot;.

<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do
so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab)
programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever
receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the Harvard Medical School reported that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Medical" target="_blank">80% of all alcoholics who
successfully quit drinking for a year or more did it alone</a>,
without any &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>

 <b><i>Doing it alone</i></b> is the proven,
successful, way of quitting. It was Bill's &quot;spiritual
treatment program&quot;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">that almost never succeeded
in curing alcoholics</a>.
Half of the original <i>Big Book</i> authors relapsed and returned to drinking.
A.A. had, and still has, less than a one percent long-term success rate (above
normal spontaneous remission).
And Bill knew that when he wrote those words, because he had 16 years
of experience in failing to cure alcoholics by the
time that he wrote his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve
Traditions</i>, in 1951 to 1952. What Bill Wilson should have written is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Few indeed were those who, so assailed, ever won through in
Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
This step is bad, really bad. It teaches people that they cannot
take care of themselves, and just quit drinking. They are told
that it isn't their fault, that it's a disease, and that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#blank_spot" target="_blank">they can't control it</a>
(so don't even bother trying). It's a setup for failure,
and a setup for dependency on the cult. It is intellectual
suicide disguised as admission of having a drinking problem.
One of the A.A. slogans is:
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;I pray to God every day that I never get the
idea that I can run my own life.&quot;</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
The truth is, self-confidence and will power are good things,
necessary strengths, and vital
tools in the battle to recover. You won't be able to resist
temptation without will power. Self-confidence helps to keep
you stable, and keep you from despairing, or getting depressed,
or freaking out. Those 12-Steppers have it all backwards.
No wonder they have nearly a 100% failure rate.
</font>

</font>

<p>

<b>Step 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore
us to sanity.</b><br>

The &quot;character defects&quot; that generate and sustain alcoholism
are a form of mental illness that is not amenable to self-treatment. Only
a power greater than the ego-self is capable of curing the alcoholic
condition. That power is ultimately God, as one understands God. But,
until that realization is made, AA or some other therapeutic agency is an
acceptable substitute.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
I'm not insane, so I don't need an invisible Higher Power or spirit or God to
restore me to sanity. I really would be insane if I <i>came to
believe</i> that I was insane and needed some ghost or spirit to
fix my brain. (Such a bizarre delusion is characteristic of schizophrenia.)
And I will eventually become pretty neurotic if I
<i>come to believe</i> that I can't trust my own thinking, because
I'm insane. That routine is illogical and self-contradictory:
<i><b>If I'm really that insane, then how can I possibly be
so clear and correct in diagnosing my insanity?</b></i>
<p>
This is religion, not a quit-drinking program. And it's crazy
religion at that. It is also a lot of unproven and <b>disproven</b>
dogma, like:<br>

<ul>
<li> You can't quit drinking all by yourself.
<font color="#9F0000">
(Yes you can.)
</font>
<li> You have to depend on A.A. and God to do the work for you.
<font color="#9F0000">
(No you don't.)
</font>
<li> Only a power greater than the ego-self &#8212; God &#8212; is capable of
curing the alcoholic condition.
<font color="#9F0000">
(Baloney. You can do it yourself.)
</font>
<li> You are insane, and only God can cure you, but meanwhile, you
should let the A.A. elders do your thinking for you.
<font color="#9F0000">
(More cult nonsense. You can help yourself. You don't need any
cult elders running your life.)
</font>
</ul>
<p>
Again, it is NOT a matter of believing in a God; it's a matter of
believing in the deluded ravings of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">a lunatic</a>
&#8212; specifically, Bill Wilson.
And it's a matter of surrendering to a cult religion.
<p>
<!--
The truth is, <b><i>MOST</i></b> people who successfully quit drinking
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment" target="_blank">do it by themselves</a>.
They do it without A.A., or the A.A. &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
or any other &quot;support group&quot;.

The acting President of the United States, George W. Bush,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Geo_Bush" target="_blank">did it just that way</a>.
He didn't waste any time on A.A., or on sitting in a church basement,
confessing that he was insane. Will A.A. call G.W. Bush
a &quot;dry drunk&quot;?
-->
</font>

<p>

<b>Step 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to
the care of God as we understood Him.</b><br>
A commitment is made to transcend the narrow
ego-self and embark on a course of spiritual growth by giving up one's
willfulness and surrendering to a power greater than self.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
More grandiose bull. Very <i>very</i> few people get to transcend
the ego,
and it is usually the culmination of many years of study and practice.
Sometimes, an entire lifetime of study and practice.
Declaring that you will quit drinking and transcend the ego
instead is just as
stupid as declaring that you are going to quit drinking and
become a world-class
concert violinist instead. Oh, and you are going to do it in
just one year, too,
even though you have never played a note before in your whole life.
<p>
Actually, here is where you are supposed to surrender to the cult.
You turn your will and your life over to the control of your
sponsor and other old-timers in the group while pretending
that you are surrendering to God.
</font>
<p>

<b>Step 4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of
ourselves.</b><br>
An honest accounting is made of &quot;character defects.&quot;
Personal assets and strengths are also noted. An awareness of
acceptability despite one's imperfections is created and is
reinforced by an accepting fellowship. Ego defenses begin to
be surrendered.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
No, personal assets, strengths, and positive qualities are
never counted.
Only bad things, like &quot;character defects&quot;,
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and &quot;resentments&quot; are counted.
The goal is to make you feel guilty, inadequate, inferior,
powerless, hopeless, and depressed, so that you can be more
easily controlled by others.
<p>
Besides, alcoholics have a &quot;disease&quot;, don't they?
They should be getting a searching and fearless
<b>medical examination</b>, not a moral inventory.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(But a medical examination won't induce enough guilt
to make you surrender to the cult...)
</font>
</font>
<p>

<a name="Step5"> </a>
<b>Step 5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human
being the exact nature of our wrongs.</b><br>
Responsibility for &quot;character defects&quot; is
accepted and acknowledged.
The ego shrinks as its defenses are overcome:
honesty increases self-esteem.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
See, you confess &quot;the exact nature of your wrongs&quot; here,
not your assets and good qualities. The goal is to induce guilt and self-doubt.
<p>
They say that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The ego shrinks as its defenses are overcome: honesty
increases self-esteem.&quot;</font>
No, actually, self-respect and self-esteem shrink as you
wallow in guilt, self-rating, and self-condemnation.
<p>
The authors shove some strange logic on us. The discussion above
talked at length &#8212; albeit indirectly &#8212; about how child abuse and
bad childhoods cause &quot;negative spirituality&quot; and
&quot;character defects&quot;, and now we are being told that our
character defects are all our own fault, so we will &quot;accept
and acknowledge the responsibility.&quot;
How is it our own fault if we were abused children?
<p>
Now there is nothing wrong with doing an honest self-assessment and
figuring out who you really are, and maybe whom you would like to
become.
I recommend it, in fact. But A.A. twists this
all around, and won't let you talk about your good qualities.
It is really just a very ordinary cult guilt-induction
process, disguised as honesty and self-improvement.
<p>
This is actually a bait-and-switch stunt. In the beginning, they
tell newcomers that they have a disease, a very dangerous,
progressive, usually-fatal disease that is something like an allergy to alcohol,
and that they are powerless over it, and that it isn't their
fault. So they don't need to feel guilty about being alcoholics.
<p>
But then they pull a medical-to-moral morph, and demand that the newcomers
list all of their sins, everything they ever did wrong in their
entire lives,
all of their <i>defects of character</i> and <i>moral shortcomings</i>,
and wallow in guilt and confess it all, confessing
<b><i>the exact nature of their wrongs</i></b>,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult2Bob" target="_blank">sometimes on their knees
in front of their sponsors.</a><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
So what do sins have to do with an allergy?<br>
</font>
Finally, the new convert is supposed to
believe that everything that ever went wrong is his own fault.
Bill Wilson wrote that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;bottles were only a symbol&quot;</font>, and
that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;our problems were of our own making.&quot;</font>
<p>
A.A. won't use the &quot;disease&quot; word again until they are trying
to hoodwink another newcomer into joining. From here on out, you are guilty of
everything.
</font>
<p>

<b>Steps 6 and 7. Were entirely ready to have God remove all those defects of
character, and humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</b><br>
Willingness to depend on God and the humility involved in that dependence are further
evidence of the lessening influence of ego and increasing spiritual growth.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
I am not just ready, I am downright eager for God to take away all of my defects and shortcomings.
I want to look like Robert Redford, sing like Neil Diamond, and play the guitar
like Jerry Garcia and Eric Clapton. So get busy, God.
You've really got Your work cut out for You this time...
<p>
Excuse me again, but increased
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Willingness to depend on God&quot;</font> does not mean
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the lessening influence of ego.&quot;</font>
Your ego is your concept of who and what you are.
Your ego doesn't stop you from believing in God.
<p>
Perhaps A.A. and the authors are trying to push a different
concept here, one of <i>egotism</i>, one of an inflated,
strutting-peacock egotism:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#ego_concept" target="_blank">A.A. likes to claim that
you have a huge, fat ego</a> that insists that it is the center
of the Universe and too big and too good to need God.
Again, A.A. implies that you are suffering from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">
delusions of grandeur</a>,
or a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
narcissistic personality disorder</a>,
just like Bill Wilson did.
<li>
A.A. says that you have to destroy your ego to quit drinking.
That is, of course, both bad psychology and bad religion. People
drink to excess because they want to kill their pain and feel good,
not
because they think they are the center of the universe.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Personally,
I never cared whether I was at the center of the Universe, or in an
obscure neighborhood on the outer rim of the Milky Way Galaxy, just as
long as the beer was cold and plentiful.)
</font>
</ul>
<p>
Plenty of religions will tell you that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Willingness to Depend on God&quot;</font>
is not spiritual growth,
it is <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">superstitious nonsense</a>
and infantile narcissism.
God is not Santa Claus, and God is not a Genie who grants three wishes
if you rub His lamp.
You should learn to depend on yourself, and not expect
God to be constantly pulling puppet strings and doing favors for you
and answering your prayers.
Very few religions believe in a God Who micro-manages the world
and grants everybody's wishes.
It is bad manners and bad theology to
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle" target="_blank">demand miracles of
God</a> &#8212;
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;The Lord helps those who help themselves.&quot;</b>
</font>
<p>
But if you learn to depend on yourself, you won't need
Alcoholics Anonymous. You won't be addicted to A.A., and A.A. says that's
really bad.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Willingness to depend on God&quot;</font>
really means
willingness to depend on the Alcoholics Anonymous cult,
and willingness to surrender
one's independence to the cult. That's the A.A. idea of holiness.
<p>

Also note the progressive change in terminology that Wilson pulled in steps 4 through
7. In step 4, we were theoretically supposed to do an honest inventory, listing both good and
bad things about ourselves.
But in step 5, we &quot;admitted our wrongs&quot;, only. Then, in step 6,
those wrongs were renamed to &quot;defects of character&quot;, and in step 7 they were
called our moral &quot;shortcomings&quot;. Labeling parts of ourselves as defective &#8212; so
defective that only God can remove the defects &#8212; is good for
instilling feelings of self-doubt and guilt, but that is not good for recovery.

</font>
<p>

<b>Steps 8 and 9. Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing
to make amends to them all, and made direct amends to such people wherever
possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</b><br>

Positive spiritual growth is tested in the humble acceptance of responsibility for
wrongs done to others. The making of amends, or just the willingness to do
so, increases self-esteem as it erodes egocentricity and constructs
positive spiritual connections with others.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
More baloney:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Positive spiritual growth is tested...&quot;</font>
Nobody has even established that the Twelve Steps have a
positive influence on people's
minds or spirituality, and yet the authors foist
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;positive spiritual growth&quot;</font>
on us as a given.
(That's the propaganda stunt called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank"><i>petitio
principii</i></a> &#8212;
&quot;assume facts not in evidence&quot;.)
If anything is really being tested here,
it is the degree of successful
cult indoctrination and conversion to cultish behavior.
<p>
There is nothing wrong with making amends, where it can be done.
And making amends reduces guilt and paranoia, and may increase
self-respect.
But to claim that it
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;erodes egocentricity and constructs
positive spiritual connections with others&quot;</font>
is pretty far-fetched.
It is just more of the A.A. religious hype, and voodoo medicine.
<p>
What's the difference between a
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;positive spiritual connection&quot;</font>
and a
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;positive social connection&quot;</font>?
It looks like the authors
are making <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#emotional_confusion" target="_blank">Bill
Wilson's standard mistake</a>: confusing &quot;spiritual&quot; things
with &quot;psychological&quot; or &quot;emotional&quot; things.
The authors are also making the mistake of using Mr. Wilson's bombastic,
grandiose descriptions of everything.
Rather than accurately saying that we are merely &quot;building
positive social relationships&quot;, the authors
like to brag that we are
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;constructing positive spiritual connections&quot;</font>.
</font>
<p>

<b>Step 10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong
promptly admitted it.</b><br>
 Behavior is continually appraised and responsibility
is taken for it. Living a life of commitment to honesty in one's
relationships ensures further development of self-esteem.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This is &quot;Repeat Steps 4 through 9, in an infinite loop.&quot;
You must continue to criticize yourself and denigrate yourself,
forever.
Note that it doesn't say anything about when you are right.
You dwell on when you are wrong. And they call that neurotic
behavior self-improvement. No wonder members relapse.

<b>Step 11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for
the knowledge of
His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b><br>
A willful ego is forsaken in the total dependence on God's will
and grace. The highest level of AA spirituality has now been
achieved.
<p>

<p>

<b>Step 12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these
steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice
these principles in all our affairs.</b><br>

(AA World Services, 1976, pp. 60-61)
Ego-transcendent spirituality is practiced in all relationships and
strengthened through helping other alcoholics. The process of
ego-deflation and positive spiritual development is, thus, complete. But
because the brain never forgets what it has learned, spiritually negative
patterns remain that can still act as relapse triggers. Therefore, the
recovering alcoholic remains in the fellowship and continues working and
reworking the twelve steps while new and more powerful patterns of
positive spirituality beliefs and attitudes are established.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
<font color="#4f007f">
<i><b>Having driven ourselves totally insane and having become
completely delusional, irrational, and superstitious, we now
promise to suck others into our cult and make them
just as crazy as we are.
We promise to be powerless, guilt-ridden, irrational and
superstitious in all of our affairs.
</b></i>
</font>
<p>
They claim that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Ego-transcendent spirituality is practiced in
all relationships.&quot;</font>
Never mind that there is, for all practical purposes, no such thing.
Oh, I do believe that a few rare saints do end up in a state something
like that, but they don't get there by drinking too much alcohol,
or by doing Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps.
Again, someone is foisting a load of bull on us, and calling it
&quot;Spirituality.&quot;
<p>
Then they go on to say that the A.A. member cannot ever leave the
cult, and must continue his self-destructive Twelve-Step behavior
forever.
He must maintain a life-long addiction to Alcoholics Anonymous.
They say,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;spiritually negative patterns remain that can still
act as relapse triggers.&quot;</i></font>
That is exactly like Scientology, which says that you have
&quot;engrams&quot;, which are memories of past injuries, and those
engrams make you insane.
You must buy lots and lots of &quot;auditing&quot;, to &quot;process
your engrams&quot;, to clear them out of your head, so you can regain
your sanity.
But you never seem to be able to clear <i>all</i> of those engrams
out of there, so you can't ever leave Scientology, or quit paying them
money...
<p>
Actually, the
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_no_exit" target="_blank"><i>You Can't
Ever Leave</i></a>&quot; rule is totally typical of cults.
It is one of the
most important defining characteristics of a cult.
<p>
Finally, note what was not said in the Twelve Steps:
<ul>
<li> They never said
that you should quit drinking, or help someone else to quit drinking.
<li> They never said anything about health, or sobriety, or recovery.
<li> They never said anything about love, or kindness, or affection.
<li> The steps just declare that we are<br>
<ul>
<li> &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; in Step One,<br>
<li> and insane in Step Two,<br>
<li> and then we must surrender our will and our lives to A.A. (or our &quot;Higher
Power&quot; who might be a bedpan or a doorknob) in Step Three,<br>
<li> and then we must spend the rest of our days listing and confessing our sins,
making amends, &quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot;,
and &quot;carrying the message&quot; to other alcoholics.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
Why don't the 12 steps describe
the process of quitting drinking for us, rather than the process of
confessing our sins? Why aren't the Twelve Steps a formula for
quitting drinking and staying quit?
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_purpose" target="_blank">Because that isn't
what A.A. is really all about:</a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.

is to fit

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson, 3rd and 4th Editions, page 77.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the only way that they want to &quot;serve&quot; other people
is to convert them to the A.A. religion. A.A. intends to perform no other
services for people, because:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson, 3rd and 4th Editions, page 98.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So don't do anything to help alcoholics, other than try to convert
them to the Twelve-Step Religion, and call that &quot;helping others
selflessly.&quot;
<p>
<center>
<hr width="50%">
</center>
<p>

Now the authors just rehash the baloney that they shoved on us earlier, telling us the
same falsehoods all over again:
</font>
<p>

As recovering alcoholics &quot;work the steps&quot; of the AA program, guided by
their sponsors in the supportive family environment, they begin to develop
positive spirituality. This is reflected in blossoming attitudes of
unconditional love, acceptance, and trust in relationships with
themselves, others, the world, life, and the God of their understanding.
They come to believe that they are fundamentally okay even if their
behaviors sometimes are not. They begin to love, accept, and trust
themselves.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This is just impossibly Pollyanna-ish.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>
Everything is just so wonderful.
Doesn't it just make you feel
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#no_self_sufficiency" target="_blank">incredibly lucky to be
an alcoholic</a>? Why, without the A.A. program, we could never have
achieved so much Heaven on Earth.

<p>
That is, of course, completely untrue.
People go crazy as they &quot;work the steps&quot;; they don't enjoy
&quot;blossoming attitudes of
<a href="orange-heresy.html#unconditional_love" target="_blank">unconditional love</a>,
acceptance, and trust&quot;.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
And watch out for any cult that yammers about
<a href="orange-heresy.html#unconditional_love2" target="_blank">unconditional love</a>:
they are just setting you up for a fall by pushing a
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_perfection" target="_blank">
super-human standard of perfection</a> on you, one that you can't possibly
live up to.
</font>
<p>

I'm not going to continue to repeat myself, like the authors here will continue to do.
Suffice it to say that we've been over all of this before.
</font>
<p>

Feeling more secure in themselves, they find the confidence to risk
reaching out to others. They find that many other AA members are worthy of
their trust and friendship and need not be manipulated to provide them
with satisfying personal relationships. They come to believe that other
human beings are fundamentally okay even if their behaviors sometimes are
not. They begin to experience loving, accepting, and trusting
relationships with others.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Pollyanna strikes again.
</font>
<p>

As they see others in AA succeeding in the world in ways that are
satisfying to them, even if not necessarily valued by society at large,
and as they find that they too are beginning to fulfill their potential
for personal development, they come to believe that the world (nature,
community, work, school) is generally a safe place for them to enjoy life
and become all that they are capable of becoming or wish to become.
Accordingly, they come to love, accept, and trust the world.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
What does this fancy double-talk mean? <font color="#4f007f">&quot;A.A.
members succeed in the world, in ways that are satisfying to them,
but in ways not valued by society at large&quot;?</font> Oops!
Just what &quot;not valued&quot; ways is A.A. pushing?
Being an unsold artist, or being a low-paid janitor for the rest of
your life,
or wasting your entire life going to A.A. meetings?
<p>
Or is it some really dark and evil stuff?<br>
Satisfying oneself with little girls when the moon gets full?<br>
Or <a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="_blank">satisfying oneself with
cocaine and child pornography and pedophilia</a>?<br>

Meeting at a cross-roads at midnight,
and drawing pentagrams on the ground,
and doing Satan-worshipping rituals that are
&quot;not necessarily valued by society at large&quot;?<br>
It could be anything, couldn't it?
The authors just leave the door wide open with
their vague, grandiose psycho-babble.
</font>
<p>

As they begin to live life through satisfying relationships with
themselves, with others, and with the world, they come to believe that
life is okay. They no longer see it as a purely biological happenstance or
some kind of cruel joke, but rather as a condition that has profound
meaning and purpose for them. They come to love, accept, and trust life.
For most members of AA, it is inconceivable that such life is not ordered
and supported by a loving God. Accordingly, they come to love, accept, and
trust God.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
So they experience religious conversion, and embrace A.A. theology.<br>
<font color="#EF000">
Notice how the authors parrot, once again, Bill Wilson's assertion that all
&quot;practicing alcoholics&quot; are really atheists who believe that life is
a random accident or a cruel joke. The authors don't even think about Catholic Priests
who drink too much Communion wine, do they?
</font>
<p>

<!--
And this is just too good:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...they begin to live life through satisfying relationships with
themselves...&quot;<br>
</font>
When we were in high school, didn't they tell us that would make
us go blind?
-->
</font>
<p>

Those who achieve this level of spiritual development show the greatest
happiness in recovery and seem to have the greatest sobriety. They seem to
have a special presence about them, a kind of light in their eyes that
draws newly recovering alcoholics to them like a magnet. They are the role
models for all who are serious about their recovery. The most effective
sponsors come from their ranks. They inspire all who are resolutely
working the steps as well as those who have newly entered AA and have not
yet committed themselves to its program.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
This is <i>really</i> delusions of grandeur. They all become like unto
reincarnations of Jesus Christ. They are all living saints, because
they have experienced religious conversion through Bill Wilson's
Twelve Steps.

<p>
Too bad this stuff doesn't really work. It would be wonderful if it
did. We could force everybody through the program, and force everybody
to become a saint. But, alas, most of the old Twelve-Steppers just
finally flip out and relapse and die drunk. Twelve-Steppers are like
time bombs, most of them will go off eventually. Really old old-timers
are as rare as hen's teeth. Not one person in a thousand makes it
in Alcoholics Anonymous for twenty years.
<p>
My doctor recently told me that late-stage alcoholism has the same
fatality rate as cancer: fifty percent. Consider that Alcoholics
Anonymous is <i>THE</i> leading alcoholism &quot;treatment&quot; program
in the country, dominating 85% to 93% of all of the treatment facilities in the USA.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">So A.A.-member counselors and
therapists give them &quot;12-Step treatment&quot;,
and then they die</a>. That's the sad reality.

</font>
<p>

Unfortunately, many of the latter will find AA's spiritual focus a
threat to the sick ego that is ruling their lives and will stop
going to the meetings.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Or maybe they will come to their senses and decide that cult
religion is not really their cup of tea.
</font>
<p>

They may continue to destroy themselves through alcohol abuse, or
they may find other solutions that are less ego threatening but
probably also less spiritually satisfying.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Yes, they may continue to destroy themselves through alcohol abuse,
or they may quit drinking.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Medical" target="_blank">
They might quit alone</a>, as a successful do-it-yourself
project, or they may go to some secular group, like SMART, WFS,
MFS, or SOS.
<p>
Admittedly, those secular meetings
won't give you the same smug, sanctimonious, conceited feelings, or tell
you that you are one of
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#chosen_people" target="_blank">the chosen children of God</a>,
busy <i>seeking and
doing the will of God</i>.<br>
You won't be able to pretend that you are a living saint,
on a mission from God,
just because you have abstained from drink for a while.<br>
You won't be able to claim that you are
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#drink_disappear" target="_blank">on the
Broad Highway,
walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe</a>,
like Bill Wilson did...
<p>
You won't get any of those extreme ego trips out of the secular groups.
In comparison to A.A., secular meetings may seem downright boring, and definitely
not so &quot;spiritually satisfying&quot; to a grandiose ego.
</font>
<p>

A secure and joyful recovery will likely elude them until they
reach out in desperation and surrender their will to the spiritual renewal
inherent in the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Once they do, they will
no longer need mood-altering chemicals to feel good about their lives.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Yes, usually, people won't surrender to a mind-controlling cult until they
<a href="orange-not_good.html#hit_bottom" target="_blank">hit bottom</a> and
are desperately trying to save their own lives. Then they behave like
drowning men grabbing at any straw, seeking something to hold onto.
They will do anything to save their lives,
even surrender their minds and their wills to a crazy cult religion.
<p>
And the claim that &quot;they will
no longer need mood-altering chemicals to feel good&quot; is also false.
A.A. members relapse all of the time.
The authors of this very article began by saying that, loud and clear.
And then the authors simply refused to admit that 85% to 93% of all
treatment programs in the USA are based on the Twelve Steps,
so
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>it is the allegedly &quot;spiritual&quot; Twelve-Step programs
that are failing constantly.</b></font>

So, apparently, the A.A. members <i><b>DO</b></i> need
mood-altering chemicals to feel good.

</font>
<p>

RECOMMENDATIONS
<p>
<a name="dsm3rq"> </a>
Alcoholism is a psychological illness (American Psychiatric Association,
1987). Observation of alcoholics and the process of alcoholism suggests
that this illness is essentially cognitive (what AA members call
&quot;stinking thinking&quot;), behavioral (habitual and dysfunctional
actions), and spiritual (relationship-centered) in nature.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Now the authors carefully tap-dance around the A.A. &quot;spiritual illness&quot; definition
of alcoholism.
They deliberately misquote <i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Third Edition Revised, 1987 <a href="#dsm3">(DSM-III-R)</a></i>,
which called <b><i>Alcohol Dependency</i></b> and
<b><i>Alcohol Abuse</i></b> mental disorders.
The American Psychiatric Association did not use
the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
or recognize it as a disease, anywhere in that book.
And the A.P.A. did not even <i>hint</i> that alcoholism might be a
&quot;spiritual disease.&quot;
One of the two authors of this so-called &quot;study&quot; is
the chairman of the Department of Psychology at Central Connecticut
State University, so he should know how to read and correctly quote
the bible of the American Psychiatric Association. So why doesn't he?
<p>
Then the authors give us another totally unsubstantiated report, claiming that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Observation of alcoholics ... suggests that this illness is
essentially cognitive, behavioral, and spiritual.&quot;</font>
Who observed what? When? What facts suggested anything?
It certainly wasn't the American Psychiatric Association that
&quot;observed&quot; or &quot;suggested&quot; something, like that
deceptive misquote tries to fool us into believing.
<p>
No real studies or scientific observations have suggested that the
&quot;disease&quot; of &quot;alcoholism&quot; is spiritual in nature,
or that there even is a &quot;disease&quot; called alcoholism,
or that there is such a thing as a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
That is all simply part of A.A.'s religious dogma, a superstitious belief that
Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> (page 64), and which is
accepted as unquestionable fact by all of the true believers of the Alcoholics
Anonymous cult.
</font>

<p>
It could be argued that a resolution of
the spiritual problem would ultimately resolve the other two. But any
attempt to achieve or influence wellness in the short run must involve all
three components. Most treatment programs focus heavily on cognitive and
behavioral change and pay little more than lip service to the spiritual
component. Recovery is thus jeopardized. The rehabilitation program of
Alcoholics Anonymous incorporates all three components, assuring recovery
if its "simple" (not necessarily easy) program is thoroughly followed (AA
World Services, 1976).
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Now the authors are really feeding us the religion and voodoo medicine.
We must, through non-logical, irrational, magical practices &#8212;
specifically Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps &#8212; fix the
&quot;spiritual&quot; component of our &quot;illness&quot;
if we really wish to recover. The authors claim that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Most treatment programs focus heavily on cognitive and
behavioral change and pay little more than lip service to the spiritual
component.&quot;</i></font>
That is really a strange accusation, considering that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#TC_study" target="_blank">93% of all of the alcoholism
treatment programs in the USA are based on the Twelve Steps</a>,
and are run by Twelve-Step true believers.
From which planet do the authors get the idea that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Most treatment programs focus heavily on cognitive and
behavioral change and pay little more than lip service to the
spiritual component&quot;</font>?

<p>
Then the authors claim that A.A.
<font color="#4f007f">
'assures recovery if its &quot;simple&quot; (not necessarily easy)
program is thoroughly followed',
</font>
and they have the gall to cite the Alcoholics Anonymous <i><i>Big Book</i></i> &#8212; &quot;AA
World Services, 1976&quot; &#8212; as &quot;proof&quot; that
the Steps work.
That's a <i><b>tautology</b></i>. They cite the cult's own book as
&quot;proof&quot; that the organization is good.
They say that the 12-Step program works great because the founder
William Wilson wrote some grandiose lies in the <i>Big Book</i> where he
bragged that the 12-Step routine worked great
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">which it didn't</a>).
<p>
And, one more time, they plant that little hint of
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#blame_victim" target="_blank">blame
the victim</a> for the failures&quot;</i>: they say that the program is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;simple, but not necessarily easy to thoroughly follow.&quot;</a>
</font>
</font>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous provides alcoholics with both a fellowship and a
program of rehabilitation. The fellowship supports the program by creating
a safe and supportive environment that allows for building the trust
necessary to work the program and overcome negative spirituality.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
We have gone over all of this before. The 12-Step program is cult religion,
not rehabilitation. A room that is frequented by
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">sexual predators</a>,
<a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor" target="_blank">neurotic power-trippers</a>,
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="_blank">child pornographers</a>,
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#such_perfect_steps" target="_blank">crazy cult true-believers</a>
is not &quot;safe.&quot; There is no such thing as this
imaginary hocus-pocus &quot;negative spirituality&quot; disorder.
</font>

<p>
<a name="no_conversion"> </a>
Contrary to the belief of many, it is not a program of conversion to
religion,
although a religious conversion is probably unavoidable as one becomes
positively spiritual.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Don't you just love the double-talk? They claim that conversion to
their religion is not the goal.  It will just accidentally
<b>&quot;probably unavoidably&quot;</b> happen if you
&quot;work the Twelve Steps&quot; properly.<br>
Talk about somebody being in denial...<br>
(<i>Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.</i>)<br>
Talk about somebody looking you straight in the eye, and lying to your face.
<p>
Religious conversion is of course the goal of the A.A. program, and Bill
Wilson said so repeatedly:

<font size="-1">
  ==  Bill Wilson's statements to the American Psychiatric
     Association 105th Annual Meeting, Montreal, Quebec, May 1949
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>
Bill Wilson devoted a whole chapter of the <i>Big Book</i>,
Chapter Four &#8212; <i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i> &#8212;
to describing how
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">all atheists and agnostics
must be converted into true believers</a>, and how we must all
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">abandon 'Reason'
and human intelligence, and just &quot;have faith&quot;</a>.

<p>
<li>
And then, in Chapter Seven &#8212; <i>Working With Others</i> &#8212; which is the
recruiting manual of A.A., Wilson taught recruiters how to tell people that
<a href="orange-recruit.html#believer" target="_blank">their own religious beliefs
and practices were inferior to those of A.A.</a>,
because their own religion had not kept them from drinking.

<p>
<li>
Finally, in Bill Wilson's second book,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
he wrote about indoctrinating and converting newcomers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubting themselves,
the rest of us were able to see the change setting in.
From great numbers of such
experiences,</a> we could predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.<br></font>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
pages 108-109.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, the real goal, and the real effect, of the Twelve-Step program is to get everyone to
&quot;love God and call Him by name.&quot;<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
And while the beginners may not be able to see how the A.A.
brainwashing program is affecting their minds and changing their
beliefs, the old-timers can see it... Bill Wilson says so.
</font>
<p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------
(And notice Bill Wilson's screwy assumption that all of the atheists
and agnostics just love their A.A. groups so much that they consider A.A.
to be their &quot;god&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the doubter who ... still considered his well-loved A.A. group
the higher power.&quot;</font>
Bill just couldn't imagine someone who didn't
consider A.A. to be all that important in his life.)
----------------------------------------------------------  -->

<p>
<li>
In that book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, Bill Wilson also told the
story of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#religious_conversion" target="_blank">a man called 'Ed'
who refused religious conversion</a>, and refused
to believe in God like the &quot;the elders&quot;
(Bill Wilson and the other old-timers)
wanted.

Ed said that the religiosity of A.A. &#8212; all of the &quot;God
nonsense&quot; &#8212; was unnecessary for sobriety.
&quot;The elders&quot; told Ed that he couldn't talk like that, or he would
have to leave.
They ostracized him and
<font color="#9F0000">hoped that he would relapse</font>.
And then, when he finally did relapse, months later, they wouldn't help him.
They abandoned him to an alcoholic death.
They didn't accept him back into A.A. until
alcohol had beaten him into such a state of submission that he was
willing to believe in God just like Bill Wilson dictated.
And then Mr. Wilson rationalized the whole story by saying
that if they had just kicked him out in the beginning, when he
refused religious conversion, that the man would never have come to
God, so deal with such guys the way that this story teaches us.
<p>
<li>
Likewise, the <i>Big Book</i> also contains
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spiritual_tolerant" target="_blank">the story of a non-believer</a>
whom 'the elders' conspired to kick out for refusing religious conversion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
At our weekly meeting I was a menace to serenity those first few months,
for I took every opportunity to lambaste that &quot;spiritual angle&quot;
as we called it, or anything else that had any tinge of theology.
Much later I discovered the elders held many prayer meetings hoping
to find a way to give me the heave-ho, but at the
same time stay tolerant and spiritual.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, in the story <i>&quot;The Vicious Cycle&quot;</i>,
3rd Edition pages 246-247 and
4th Edition pages 227-228.</font>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<p>
And still, the authors of this article actually have the gall to lie to us
and say that religious conversion is not the goal of the Alcoholics Anonymous program
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;...although a religious conversion is probably unavoidable...&quot;</b>
</font>
</font>

<p>
It is, rather, a sophisticated process of
rehabilitative personality development. The twelve steps are designed to
confront a diseased ego and promote its transcendence through creation and
maintenance of positive spirituality, shown by loving, accepting, and
trusting relationships with the self, others, the world, life, and
ultimately, with God, as one understands God.

<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
It is a sophisticated process of <a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">CULT</a>
personality development, one that resembles
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds" target="_blank">the Red Chinese brainwashing</a>

you a new cult-member personality, and turn you into a true-believer

<p>

They want to create more members who feel completely justified in
practicing
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive
recruiting</a>, and who feel comfortable with lying to other people
whenever they think it will further their cultish goals, just like
the authors of this article have repeatedly done to us
(in
<a href="#dsm3rq">the DSM-III-R quote</a> above, and in the
&quot;no religious conversion&quot; statement, just for starters).
They want to create more cult members who think that
<a href="#totally_dependent">addiction to cult religion
is &quot;freedom&quot;</a>.
<p>
By the way, there is no such thing as a &quot;diseased ego&quot;.
The authors wrote:<br>
<font color="black">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The twelve steps are designed to confront a diseased ego and promote its transcendence ...<br>
</font>
That is pseudo-scientific bunkum, just more psycho-babble.
Your ego is your self-image, your concept of who and what you are.
Concepts don't catch spiritual diseases.
That's a bunch of nonsense.
</font>
<p>
The alcoholic personality is grounded in a destructive negative spirituality.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
<font color="green">
Yeh, he drinks with Darth Vader, in a bar called <i>The Dark Side</i>.
And I'll bet he has cooties, too.
</font>
<p>
Actually, they are again trying to foist that stereotype of <i>The
Alcoholic</i> on us.
The truth is, some people who drink too much have very negative
outlooks on life, very negative personalities. And some don't. Some
are actually very cheerful and happy when drunk.
Some are mentally ill,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">like Bill Wilson was</a>,
and some aren't. Some have other problems,
serious medical or psychiatric problems, things that they have been
trying to fix by self-medicating with drugs or alcohol.
And some people don't have those problems.
Some alcoholics are criminals,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">like Bill Wilson was</a>,
and some aren't.
Some alcoholics are full of bitterness, anger, resentment, and hatred,
like Bill Wilson was, and some are not.
Some alcoholics are in pain, and are just trying to kill their pain.
And some aren't.
<p>
Simplistic stereotypes just do not work. People are all different,
and a one-size-fits-all treatment program is very bad medicine.
<p>
And the phrase &quot;destructive negative spirituality&quot; is just
some more undefined psycho-babble.
</font>

<br>
<a name="joyful_dependence"> </a>
<p>

The AA program reverses that negative spirituality and
provides the conditions necessary for a higher level of personality
development to help recovering alcoholics satisfy their basic needs
without alcohol and achieve a sense of well-being in their lives. If that
development ultimately includes a joyful dependence on God, it seems far
preferable to a destructive dependence on alcohol.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
More cult propaganda:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The AA program reverses that negative spirituality...&quot;
</font>
That sounds like some really neat technology. Is it patented? It
sounds a lot like the innermost secrets of The Church of Scientology,
&quot;LRH tech&quot;...
<p>
Or Star Trek:<br>
<font color="#007F00">
<b>Kirk:</b> Scottie, energize the flux capacitors, and engage the
negative spirituality reversers, and get us out of here!<br>
<b>Scottie:</b> Captain, I cannah do it. She's givin' all she can. She's gonna blow!
</font>
<p>

And once again, the authors rationalize the resulting religious
conversion that this &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot; program
isn't supposed to cause.
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;If that development ultimately includes a joyful dependence
on God, it seems far preferable to a destructive dependence on
alcohol.&quot;
</i></font>
They claim that addiction to cult religion is superior to addiction
to drinking. That is <i>really</i> debateable, actually.
Addiction to alcohol is really bad, horrible, a genuine nightmare,
but cult religions are an evil cancer too.
And what about the suicides that A.A. and the Twelve Steps have caused?
Those people are not better off.
What about the people who died because their sponsors ordered them to
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">quit taking their medications</a>?
</font>
<p>

The spiritual component essential to rehabilitation continues to be
misunderstood and misapplied.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
No surprise there, considering that they still haven't even defined spirituality.
The authors do not seem to understand spirituality themselves.
They just implied that negative emotions are negative spirituality,
and that belief in a Higher Power and having a positive slant on life
is positive spirituality.
<p>
They stated that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Spirituality is concerned with whomever or whatever is most important in a
person's life.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
And then they said that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Essentially, spirituality involves attitudes
that are based on beliefs about our relationships with our self, with
other human beings, with our world (including our physical and social
environments), with life (as to its meaning and purpose), and ultimately,
with God, a Higher Power, or 'Universal Consciousness'.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
&#8212; All of which gives us a vague feeling about what they think spirituality is, but they
were never any more specific than that. Their incomplete definition really just tells us
that their idea of spirituality is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;attitudes based on beliefs about relationships&quot;,
</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;concerns about what is important to us.&quot;
</font>
That is just simple psychology. That isn't really spirituality.
<p>
In fact, in the final analysis, that &quot;spirituality&quot; is
just people's opinions of things.
And you know the old saying about opinions:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Opinions are like ass-holes &#8212; everybody's got one.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Those opinions, attitudes, beliefs, and concerns actually have
little or nothing to do with God or any
friendly supernatural Higher Power, or experiencing
higher planes of existence, or developing your mental powers,
or purifying your heart and your mind,
or filling your heart with love,
or any of the other things that knowledgeable priests, ministers,
and other spiritual teachers are talking about when they talk about
&quot;spirituality.&quot;
Opinions are just opinions.
Bill Wilson would not have known spirituality if it had walked up
to him and bitten him.
And his followers don't seem to know anything more about it
than he did, either.
They just love to yammer &quot;spirituality&quot; because it
really sounds Holy and religious,
and it inflates their egos and makes them feel good.
They have a lot of fun
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#make_believe" target="_blank">playing
spiritual make-believe</a>. (Which is typical of cults.)
<p>
Something that religious fanatics don't seem to be able to
understand is
the fact that making people into religious converts does not
make those people any more holy.
Getting people to parrot all of the teachings and beliefs of
a religion just makes them into jabbering parrots.
The true believers in the religion may get a lot of satisfaction
out of being
surrounded by parrots who say what the true believers want to hear,
but that doesn't help the converts any.
Real virtue, real holiness, and real religion are something else.
<p>
Ask yourself,
<ul>
<li> why did William Wilson never teach his followers things like,
&quot;You must fill your hearts with love and light&quot;,
or &quot;Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be known
as the children of God&quot;?
<li> Why did Wilson teach such
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">
hateful contempt for alcoholics?</a>
<li> Why did Wilson
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#outerdark" target="_blank">dwell on
negative things so much?</a>

<li> Why did Bill Wilson make
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">
a habit of philandering</a>, cheating on the
wife who was working to support him, and then confessing that he was
&quot;powerless&quot; over his sexual urges?

<li> Why did Wilson also teach that he was powerless over every other
urge or craving he ever got, including
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">cravings for cigarettes</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#loved_LSD" target="_blank">desire for drugs</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">urge to embezzle money</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">urge to philander and sexually exploit newcomer women</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#few_weeks" target="_blank">temptation to lie</a>,
and the 
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">impulse to be a publicity hog</a>?
</ul>
</font>

<p>
This article will have served its purpose if it stimulates further
inquiry into the nature and impact of spirituality in recovery from
alcoholism, and perhaps other addictions as well.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
Gee, and I thought their purpose was to push A.A. and the Twelve Steps on us.
Undoubtedly, they will be <i>delighted</i> with my further inquiry here...
</font>

<p>
<a name="measures"> </a>
Nevertheless, there exists a need for measures that will demonstrate the
therapeutic effectiveness of positive spirituality in the twelve step
rehabilitation program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Such measures should
include a questionnaire to determine the effectiveness of positive
spiritual attitudes in achieving a sense of wellness that precludes the
use of mood altering chemicals and other instruments designed to assess
the development and rehabilitative effectiveness of positive spirituality
in the twelve step program.
<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;There exists a need for measures that
will demonstrate the therapeutic effectiveness...&quot; of A.A.</font>?<br>
<i>Say what?!</i> That is wishful thinking.
It is also the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank"><i>Assume the Major Premise</i></a>.
<p>
There is a need for some
more real clinical tests and medical studies of the effectiveness of A.A.-based therapy,
but it is highly unlikely that such tests will show good results
for 12-Step treatment. <i>None</i> of the previous ones did.
<p>
The few proper scientific studies of Alcoholics Anonymous
that have been done so far show that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific" target="_blank">A.A.
is no better than <i>no treatment at all</i></a> for treating alcoholism.

Other studies have shown that A.A. is actually <i>far worse</i> than no treatment.
In Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma's 5-year-long test, the people who
received A.A. training did
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank">five times as much
binge drinking</a> after they were taught that they
were &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; in A.A. Step One.
And the A.A. group did <i>nine times</i> as much binge drinking as another group
of alcoholics who got Rational Behavior Therapy (something very similar to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315025904/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>).
<p>
And again, Professor George Vaillant, Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">got no such good
results</a> from his 8-year-long test of A.A.-based treatment of alcoholics.
<font color="#9F0000">
He found that the biggest effect of A.A.-based treatment was that it raised the
death rate of the patients.
</font>


<p>
And I <b><i>*really*</i></b> want to see that questionnaire which is supposed to
&quot;determine the effectiveness of positive spiritual attitudes...&quot;
Just how shall we measure
<ul>
<li> &quot;spirituality&quot;,
<li> &quot;positive spirituality&quot;,
<li> &quot;negative spirituality&quot;,
<li> &quot;faith&quot;,
<li> or &quot;belief in God&quot;?
</ul>
<p>
How do we measure the &quot;effectiveness&quot; of those things? Effect on what?
That will be a very interesting study.

<p>
But it really would be interesting to see a good, large, long,
controlled study of the &quot;increased spirituality&quot; that is
supposedly caused by practicing the Twelve Steps. And let's also measure
<b><i>the success rate in actually quitting drinking and staying quit</i></b> while we are at it.
(Remember that quitting drinking is what Alcoholics Anonymous was supposed to be about.
But the authors here are now telling us that A.A.
is about &quot;the therapeutic effectiveness of positive spirituality&quot;.)

<p>
While we are doing that big clinical study, I'd like to see these things
measured or counted, too:<br>
<b>
<ul>
<li> economic improvement or decline
<li> mental health
<li> physical health
<li> leaving Alcoholics Anonymous
<li> total abstinence from alcohol and drugs
<li> relapse
<li> moderate, controlled drinking
<li> binge drinking
<li> drunk-driving arrests
<li> other arrests
<li> imprisonment
<li> child abuse and molestation
<li> 13th-Stepping of A.A. newcomers
<li> people being told to not take their doctor-prescribed medications
<li> hospitalization
<li> divorce
<li> neurosis
<li> psychosis
<li> suicide
<li> and other deaths
</ul>
</b>

<p>
All of those things should be measured or counted often, at the same
time, over a period of many years, like 10 or 20 years, to see how
those things really correlate with the practice of
the Twelve Steps and A.A.'s &quot;positive spirituality&quot;.
And those patients who stop going to A.A. should still be included in
the study, to track what happens with the A.A. drop-outs.<br>

<!-------
(One study found that A.A. dropouts did worse than other alcoholics who got
no A.A. &quot;help&quot;, &quot;education&quot;, or indoctrination whatsoever.
Again, teaching people that
they are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; has very negative effects.
Those dropouts may have quit A.A., but not before some very bad ideas were
planted in their heads.)
----------->

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>And all such studies or experiments <i>must</i> have control groups, of course.</b><br>
</font>

That means, you have another group that gets no treatment, so that
you can do a side-by-side comparison between the treated group and
the untreated group, to see what effect the treatment really has.
</font>


<p>
The hope of the authors is that more reliable
scientific proofs will be accumulated to buttress the voluminous anecdotal
and heuristic evidence already documenting the central role of
spirituality in treating alcoholism.

<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
<i>More reliable?</i> There haven't been <b><i>any</i></b> yet,
so we don't just need
&quot;more reliable&quot; scientific proofs, or more &quot;reliable&quot;
scientific proofs, either. As the authors admit in that sentence,
all that exists is rumor, anecdotal stories, and cult belief in the program.
But I'm all for us conducting a bunch of valid medical studies, to show everyone
what the real truth is. Just make sure that they are real studies,
honest and fair studies, not some faked, fudged studies like Project MATCH...<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
And make sure that those studies have control groups, something that
Project MATCH failed to do.</font>
</font>

<p>
Perhaps then, the concept of
spiritual awakening promised by Alcoholics Anonymous and other similar
twelve step programs will be better understood, accepted, and effectively
applied by addiction sufferers as well as those who would aid in their
recovery.

<p>
<font color="#0000FF">
And then again, maybe people will start to believe that the Moon
really is made of blue cheese.

This is one of the most insane and vicious books around.
It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">hate content</a>,
is concerned.  It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's explanation of his
Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, but it is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">something quite dark and evil</a>,
Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for human nature masquerading
as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">all of his own
weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Look at him.
Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>
This whole book is non-stop guilt induction.

Dewey: 362.29 W112t<br>
This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is
very positively slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author
knew Mr. Wilson and worked beside him for the last 12 years of
Mr. Wilson's life. And rumor has it that this book was prepared
from autobiographical tapes that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's warts,
his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his years-long
&quot;dry drunks&quot;...

<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>

Francis Hartigan was the secretary of and confidant to Bill Wilson's
wife Lois. This book is pretty much a white-wash and tells the whole
story from Bill's point of view. But it does contain a few surprises,
like the chapter &quot;The Other Woman&quot; which details Bill's
love affair with Helen Wynn, and hints at all of his other affairs
where he cheated on Lois, both before and after sobriety, all of his
married life.

<i>Bill W. and Mr. Wilson &#8212; The Legend and Life of A.A.'s

University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, Mass., 2000.<br>
ISBN: 1-55849-245-3<br>
Dewey: B W11r 2000<br>
This book was written by another stepper &#8212; the name 'Matthew Raphael'
is a pen name &#8212; and it generally praises Bill Wilson and recites
the standard party line about most things, but it also contains a
bunch of surprises, like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his
and Bob's spook sessions &#8212; talking to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances
through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping, clairvoyance, and
channeling, LSD use, and publicity-hound megalomania.

This book will curl your hair. One fair-minded 12-Stepper suggested that
every new member should be issued copies of both the <i>Big Book</i> and this
book when he or she walks in the door, to tell the newcomers about both
the good and bad things that could happen to them in &quot;the rooms.&quot;
One of the most disturbing repeated themes is women who were the victims
of rape or thirteenth-stepping being told to just shut up and find their
part in it, and to not harbor any resentments against their attackers.
