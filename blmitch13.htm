<h3>
German Court Date Delayed</h3>
The latest news in the case of a German A.A. member being sued for printing
and distributing free Alcoholics Anonymous literature, is an attorney for
the GSO in Germany (AAeV) in Frankfurt wrote to the court requesting a
postponment due to illness. He stated he needed a vacation to recouperate.

There has also been some action on the part of German Delegates for their
General Service Conference, via urgent requests, to postpone the trial
until after the conference (which is held in April). The delegates wanted
to be able to vote upon whether or not litigation was in violation of the
5th Warranty of the 12th Concept for World Service.
<p>&nbsp;The new trial date has been set for May 28, 1998. That is, unless
the German General Service Conference Delegates vote that litigation is
a violation due to public controversy and personally punitive actions against
an AA member.
<p>&nbsp;Similar requests have been made to the US/Canada General Service
Conference. All of which have been denied access as an agenda item to the
upcoming US/Canada Conference in April.
<p>&nbsp;There were also several "minority opinion" requests made for an
agenda item to be placed before the 1998 Conference for a full disclosure
of total litigation and legal costs. These too have been met with a denial
for these requested agenda items to be placed.
<p>&nbsp;There was another "minority opinion" agenda item proposed relating
to a Tradition violation by the Board of Trustees. This violation of Tradition
7 was the fact that the Board of Trustees and AA World Services had accepted
an incentive payment of $250,000 from the City of San Diego to host the
1995 World Service Convention. There are also plans to accept as incentive
payment, $100,000 from the host city of the year 2000 Convention in MN.
These payments by municipalities clearly violate the Tradition which states
that AA will not accept outside contribuions.
<p>&nbsp;This "minority opinion" request may or may not be allowed to be
placed before the 1998 Conference. This proposal for a vote whether or
not to return the $250,000 to San Diego was made by a former Trustee.
<p>&nbsp;AA World Serivces is continuing to accept stories for the proposed
4th Edition of the Big Book. These new stories will replace several of
the currently existing ones, including several of the pioneer stories.
Who knows, maybe no one will ever be able to refer to page 449 anymore
relating to acceptance.
<p>&nbsp;We will keep you updated on any new developments.
