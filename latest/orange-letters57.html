From:  	&quot;Pete K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	AA High Priests<br>

<p>

A. Orange,

<p>
Just read your article
<a href="orange-coffee.html">The Hazelden Coffee War</a>.
You have a number of
interesting points to consider and I appreciate your basic theme.

<p>
My amateur observations on the critical side are that as you bash AA
(high priests for instance) you drive the wedge between  good AA and
good medicine deeper and deeper. High priests would call certain folks
quacks and the war would continue.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Pete,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. But hold on right there &#8212; What &quot;good A.A.&quot;?
A.A. has a zero percent success rate above normal spontaneous remission coupled with
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">the worst death rate of
any treatment program</a>. So what is good about it?
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">A.A. also raises
the rate of binge drinking enormously</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a> that A.A.
messed up a lot of alcoholics so that they required more expensive hospitalization later on.
<p>
That is not good.
</font>
<p>

I have become fascinated by those, like you, who choose to attack AA.
and those in AA who attack other alcoholism help beyond AA. If we all
put as much energy into solutions as we do divisions, maybe we who need
help can have more and better help? We do not need turf wars and
emotional criticism in the air while we die from our illness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is not a turf war. Alcoholics Anonymous is really bad quack medicine that
kills patients.
</font>
<p>

I think it is easy for anyone to have issues, but much more difficult to
address solutions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Try this list of alternatives,
<a href="orange-letters54.html#alt_list">here</a>. We have been over this before.
<p>
Besides which, quackery should
be criticized, even if you don't have a working alternative. If someone is selling
witchcraft and voodoo medicine as a cure for cancer, shouldn't we expose and denounce
the quackery, even if we don't have a 100% sure-fire cure to offer as an alternative?
<p>
Of course we should.
</font>
<p>

I tell my AA story to Vanderbilt residents twice a year along with a
number of  other AA members. It is a wonderful exchange of viewpoints
all focused on potential solutions. We appreciate the leaders who bring
us all together in the same rooms.

<p>

And it has become a genuine growth course for me to sponsor doctors and
psychiatrists along with the unemployed laborers. We have many AA's who
are heavily involved in many &quot;other&quot; potential remedies or helpers
(virtual reality for instance to help the treatment processes).

<p>
<font color="blue">
No matter how much you enjoy the social events and sponsoring others, A.A. is still
a cult religion that kills more people than it saves.
</font>
<p>

Anyway &#8212; thanks again for the theme.

<p>

Peace, <br> 
Pete K.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You have a good day too.

<p>

Hi Again, A. Orange!

<p>

Your experiences growing up with an alcoholic parent, could really give
you an awareness of why all that serene acceptance of any realities
including any that alcoholics in the family had caused, is totally
out-of-balance!  Yet I'm sure that those in Al-Anon/Ala-Teen don't care
how much &quot;In All Our Affairs: Making Crises Work for You,&quot; is obviously
out-of balance!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Sharen,
<p>
Yes, you understand the situation correctly. Having been an abused and terrorized
child makes me hypersensitive to the issue of child abuse, and the insane stupidity
of allowing the situation to continue (which is what my mother did).

</font>
<p>

Also, is there any reason why you send your responses to e-mails, as
HTML attachments?  Attachments tend to be how computer viruses are sent
around, so plenty of virus-checking software has screened-out
attachments, a lot of people would be afraid to open them, etc.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I have several reasons. First off, let me rephrase your last sentence:
strange attachments and web pages with malicious javascript code or gimicked images
are how some criminal bastards send viruses to
other people who run Micro$uck operating systems,
but I am not one of those criminal people. In addition, I run Linux, so there is no
way that I can get infected with a Micro$uck virus and spread it to others.
(Not all operating systems are as badly written and insecure as Billy's abortions.)

<p>
I write in HTML because it saves me the labor of typing answers to letters twice.
The same text that goes into the letter to the correspondent also goes into a web page
on my web site. In addition, there isn't any other easy way to fix the font colors so that
letters to me are black and my responses are blue, and to add the formatting like fonts
and indents. And then the links are impossible outside of HTML. I often like to point
to something in another of my files, and say, &quot;more information is <i>here</i>&quot;.

<p>
So there are just a lot of advantages to writing in HTML.
</font>
<p>

And regarding Niebuhr's ideas and how morally bankrupt they
are, <i>Reinhold Niebuhr, a biography</i>, by Richard Wightman Fox, says that
in the last half of the 1930s Niebuhr had almost a cult following among
young Christians in England, giving a student conference at Swanwick.
Among his fans (not his detractors) a favorite limerick was:

<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
At Swanwick when Niebuhr had quit it<br>
A young man exclaimed &quot;I have hit it!<br>
Since I cannot do right<br>
I must find out tonight<br>
The right sin to commit &#8212; and commit it.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>

Also, the entry on Niebuhr in <i>The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition,
2001</i>

(<!-- a href="http://www.bartlebee.net/65/ni/NiebuhrR.html" -->
http://www.bartlebee.net/65/ni/NiebuhrR.html<!-- /a -->
<!-- /a -->
<font color="#9F0000">(Dead Link, Domain Name Lost.</font>)),
says that he
&quot;defended Christianity as the world view that best explains the heights
and barbarisms of human behavior.&quot;  And that explanation of the
barbarisms, was a very stereotypically German conception of the
ineradicability of aggression.  Books against this conception are very
likely to cynically compare it to the Doctrine of Original Sin, which
was Niebuhr's favorite.

From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: your letter to the Orange Papers<br>

<p>

Hi Again, A. Orange!

<p>

First off, regarding why your mom didn't divorce your violent dad, do you know why
she didn't?  Divorce could be very problematic for a woman with children.  You've
probably heard the term, &quot;the feminization of poverty,&quot; which first took place in
the 1980s, when both the Sexual Revolution and feminism said that women shouldn't
feel obligated to stay in bad marriages, yet how our economy affected divorcees
didn't change.  The hippies led this freedom from the restrictions of marriages, and
the hippies didn't mind living in poverty.  I don't know if your dad was a
functional alcoholic, and if so, how much money he made.  Yet I'd imagine that
divorce probably would have disrupted your family greatly.  Added to this is the
fact that since our economy so penalizes divorce especially for the ex-wives, many
of them would try very hard to make their marriages work, including taking their
husbands' word for it when they sincerely say that they'll try to change.

<p>
<font color="blue">
My father was a career sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, and he was an underpaid
functional alcoholic, like so many in the military. He was actually highly functional,
and very good at his job. He made it to the very top of the ranks &#8212; he got as many
stripes on his arm as it was possible to get.
His brain didn't degenerate from alcohol until the end
of his drinking career.
<p>
Unfortunately, he was also simultaneously insane and vicious and violent. But that
condition existed before the alcoholism got bad. I think it was more the cause of
his alcoholism.

<p>
The time was in the 50's and 60's, and in those days, people didn't divorce like
they do today. In fact, it was a stigma &#8212; failure to make a family. &quot;There must be
something wrong with the woman.&quot;
<p>
For a lot of years, my mother just kept hoping that things would get better.
They didn't. They got worse.
<p>
My mother finally did divorce him, after I had left home, when he retired
from the military and become a full-time drinker and really went off the deep end.
I would have preferred it if she
had made that move about 20 years earlier. But I understand the predicament
she was in &#8212; both social and economic. Plus she was in denial and doing a lot
of wishful thinking.
</font>
<p>

Sure, I realize that you're not a criminal scuzzbag who writes computer viruses.
Yet I've had enough problems with people not getting my e-mails simply because they
contained pictures, that I'd like to find every way possible to avoid attachments.
As for me, how I get HTML into my e-mails, is that I write what I want on a webpage
in Microsoft Front Page, and then simply copy the text onto an e-mail in Outlook
Express.  I don't know how Linux and its programs work, but I'd think that if you
used the copy function to copy whatever you've written with your webpage program,
then when you paste it into an e-mail, that would include all HTML formatting that
you put in the original.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have also had messages blocked, like when I tried to send some requested files
to a TV reporter and the firewall into his organization blocked the HTML pages.
<p>
But in general, it isn't a problem. What we really need is two things:<br>
1. smarter
email programs that can scan incoming mail and check for malicious code or
gimicked image files. Just assuming that all HTML pages are bad is simplistic and
stupid.<br>
2. smarter operating systems (meaning Micro$uck) that are not vulnerable to
every virus and trojan horse that wanders down the street.
<p>
You don't see the Linux users complaining about email viruses or trojan horses or worms,
because it isn't a problem. The big security hole is in the way that Micro$uck
systems will automatically execute any code or instructions that
they find in a document or image.
That is totally insane, suicidally stupid, but that's how Billy does it, as a
&quot;convenience to the user&quot; &#8212; &quot;automatically helping him&quot;.

<p>
So if there is a macro in a Microsoft Word document, it gets run when you look at the
document. (They might have modified or fixed that somewhat lately, because there were
just so many bad macros going around.)
<p>
Likewise, if there is any Javascript code in a web page, it gets run. Now that one
is true of both Microsoft and Linux browsers. However, the Linux system security is good,
and won't let a javascript routine hurt the operating system or the hard disk. Microsoft will.
<p>
The latest big discovery was that Micro$uck is so stupid that the operating system's code
for displaying images actually tries to execute any instructions that
it finds in the header &#8212; in the start of the image file. That means that
if you just look at a page on a malicious web site that contains
a gimicked image, that your system will get infected and taken over by a virus
as it downloads and displays the image on your screen.

<p>
That is flat-out insane. Pictures are things that you look at and display,
not programs that you run. You don't give control of the computer to a
byte pattern that you find in an image.
But Micro$uck does, and with your computer.
<p>
So you see, the problem is not in emailing web pages. The problem is
that Microsoft's programmers literally do not have a clue when it comes
to system security.
Their systems have as many security holes as Swiss cheese.
The criminals and virus-writers really have an easy time of it with Microsoft.
</font>
<p>

For example, my e-mail program doesn't do framing, highlighting, etc., so if I want
to incorporate any of that into my e-mails, I type the text into my webpage program,
then just copy and paste it into my e-mails.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What I do is even easier, and since I run Linux, it just isn't a problem. I am in no
danger, and what I do does not endanger Micro$uck users either.
<p>
And links are don't work, or are very messy, without HTML.
</font>
<p>

Have a good day!

<p>

From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Chronically Manic Personalities<br>

<p>

Hi Again, A. Orange!

<p>

One thing that you wrote in your attachment, &quot;Unfortunately, he was also
simultaneously insane and vicious and violent. But that condition existed before the
alcoholism got bad. I think it was more the cause of his alcoholism,&quot; confirms an
impression that I got of you from the very beginning.  You've probably noticed than
my e-mail signature says, &quot;Ever since I was a teenager, anyone who didn't have a
chronically manic personality seemed half dead to me, smirk, smirk.&quot;  I got the
impression that you have the positive qualities of chronically manic personalities,
which science calls &quot;hyperthymic&quot; personalities, and your dad sounds like he had the
negative qualities of them.

<p>

In essence, what hyperthymics tend to look like, is the celebrities who attract
hordes of groupies, charismatic smart and creative, but also tending to have plenty
of artistic-temperament-style behavior problems, such as boozing, doping,
irascibility, flamboyant eccentricities, and irresponsibility.  If you surrounded
yourself with all of the celebrities who attract hordes of groupies, you sure would
tend to associate with people who have artistic-temperament-style behavior problems,
so you could very easily seem to have a subconscious codependent attraction to
artistic-temperament-style behavior problems.  Yet the only groupies who are
attracted to the boozing and doping, are those who want to share the booze and dope.

<p>

In essence, we tend to fit both the positive (very caring) and the negative (very
uncaring) stereotypes of artists, though these might look like exact opposites of
each other.  From the beginning, you've come across to me as fitting the positive
stereotypes of artists, in that you're aware of, and give a %$#@ about, some very
consequential things that most people don't have that sort of empathy about.  I have
several webpages on hyperthymic personalities, the main ones being at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/AboutUsSumm.htm</a> and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html">
http://home.att.net/~s.l.keim/About_Us.html</a>.

<p>

And if any behavior pattern intuitively comes across as &quot;insane,&quot; then it probably
is.  Not only that, hyperthymics could often be impulsive, and that impulsivity
often leads to booze and/or dope problems.  The webpage &quot;hyperthymic personality
disorder,&quot; at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-986382297.htm">
http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/cache/-986382297.htm</a>, defines this as,
&quot;Individuals with a hyperthymic personality disorders are persistently more happy
and optimistic than normal.  They have marked enthusiasm for life but on the other
hand tend to be rash and show poor judgement.&quot;  That's also what an &quot;addictive
personality&quot; looks like.

<p>

And this could be one reason why many of those married to addicts, such as your mom
and those considered codependent, could seem to be &quot;in denial&quot; about their spouses'
getting control over their own addictions.  Most of the time, these people could
come across as being at least normal enough that they'd at least be able to know
better.  Since drug and alcohol abuse is so obviously self-destructive, it's
understandable that some think that those with drug and alcohol problems should be
able to see the dangers.  If most people took the same prescription painkillers that
Rush Limbaugh became addicted to, they'd simply do whatever it took to get over any
physical dependence to the drugs, and could never become overcome by temptations to
relapse.  Naturally these people would figure that addicts should want to make
things get better for themselves.  A few days ago, I heard someone describe the wife
of a hyperthymic guy who's nice most of the time but every now and then does some
very cynical things, as being &quot;in denial&quot; about his cynical tendencies.

<p>

Yesterday I e-mailed a British dude about those webpages of mine.  I ordered from
him some Al-Anon jewelry that he makes by hand, from his website.  His software
wasn't working right, so while he got my e-mail address and the fact that I'd paid
for it, he didn't get either exactly what I ordered, or my postal address.  I
e-mailed him, with my signature about chronically manic personalities.  His e-mail
back to me began &quot;yeah..I know what you mean !!,&quot; which I guess refers to the
signature.  I therefore e-mailed him about these webpages.  Since he makes AA and
related jewelry, he must have at least some familiarity with addicts, or is one, and
it's very likely that this has to do with his affinity for hyperthymic
personalities, or has one himself.

<p>

Also, I'd imagine that those with careers in the military would be unusually likely
to be aggressive hyperthymics.  While I realize that the Iraq invasion may not be
typical, I'd think that the decision-makers who'd fit in best with it, are those who
are very prone to getting agitated, and who are oblivious to the consequences of
their own behavior, with plenty of excuses handy, such as &quot;Stop whining like an
untermensch!&quot;.

I really do think that the best way for you to see this, is to look at all the ways
in which you must have noticed that you're different from most people.  You must
have realized that you have a great deal of insight into, and awareness of, moral

<p>

As portrayed in the AA literature,&quot;we are never cured&quot;.  That surely is
a low grade for the entire program and and its concept of the
supernatural.  Thanks for the site
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Keneth,
<p>
and thanks for the notes. Yes, the refusal of the medical establishment to
really deal with the problem, and their continuing to push quackery and cult religion
as &quot;treatment&quot; for addictions is appalling.
You have to wonder what is the matter with <i>their</i> heads.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

A.A. still has the Twelve Steps listed on its website. Their redesign
killed existing links though:

<p>

I learned the hard way when I was trying to snag some documentation
showing how A.A. aggressively recruits through the criminal justice
system. It would be nice if A.A. would archive its Triennial Surveys
though. But then, in an Orwellian way, that would mean that A.A.
would have to be held accountable for the past and what's going on in
the present. No wonder they don't keep online archives of such
pertinent information (well, the AA Grapevine digital archive is a
start but lacking in regards to statistical data).

<p>

Anyhow, there is a search box at the top of the screen above A.A.'s
gaudy homepage Flash animation.
<p>
And be well and live well one LIFETIME at a time! :-)

<p>

Orange,

<p>

While I was perusing your site I noticed that you said all recovery home
were funded by taxpayers money or they charged exorbitant fees such as
Hazelton at $15,000.  For the most part that is true.  However, FYI there
two right here in Southern California that run ONLY ON PRIVATE DONATIONS
AND NO CHARGE TO THE CLIENT.

<p>

Just thought you should know as much info as possible so you can spout
the truth (sometimes).

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I have been sober and clean for over 15 years and don't go to meetings
and haven't for about 7 years now, but I don't think AA is a cult, it
was what I needed at the time and I would encourage anyone with a
problem to try it out.  I will not get into a debate with you, but some
of your &quot;facts&quot; are not facts, they are misrepresentations.  Please
continue to do what you are doing.  It is needed.

<p>

Sincerely,<br>
karen

<font color="blue">
Hello Karen,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the compliments.
<p>
I know that there are treatment centers that do not charge the patient. Heck,
<a href="orange-intro.html">I went to one</a>.
There, a cocaine-snorting child molester taught us to &quot;have a Higher Power in our recovery
program&quot;, and to go to three meetings a week,
and the bill for such &quot;treatment&quot;
went to city, state, and federal agencies and health insurance plans.
(Often with double-billing.)

The so-called &quot;counselors&quot; were still a bunch of money-grubbing criminals,
but they did not charge me a penny. It was the taxpayers who got cheated.
(Well of course! Who has the most money? A down-and-out alcoholic, or the government?)
<p>
Are you really 100% certain that the two clinics that you mention do not get any
money from health insurance or government grants? Or from any other taxpayer-supported agencies?
Have you examined their books or their income statements to discover how they really
finance their activities?

<p>
The fact that you liked A.A. and feel that you benefited from it doesn't change the
facts that A.A. is a very harmful organization that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">kills more people than it saves</a>.
It really
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">messes up a lot of alcoholics</a>.

<p>
There will always be some people, like yourself and me, who are just destined to quit
drinking and save their own lives, no matter what kind of a crazy program they end up in.
But that still leaves a large pile of dead bodies over in the corner.
<p>
If you have any other issues you wish to explore, I'm open.
I do not print &quot;misrepresentations&quot;.
I am above all interested in the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
because the lives of friends and acquaintances are on the line here.

<p>
Have a good day.

Orange,

I AM ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY sure that the two that I am talking about take no
insurance, tax payer or any other money other than private donations, and
yes, I have checked the book, as a matter of fact.  Only money from those
that CHOOSE  to donate to these two programs.  It is absolutely free to the
clients and to the taxpayers and the insurance companies.  they do that for
a reason, that way no one can tell them that they have to do something a
certain way.  These are called social model detoxes and recovery homes.
Again, NO MONEY from anyone except those that choose to donate.

Hi again, Karen,
<p>
Okay, I'll take your word for it that they are somehow surviving solely on contributions.
That is a very, very unusual treatment center.
<p>
Now the next question is, &quot;Is their ulterior motive to recruit more
members for the 12-Step cult religion?&quot;
<p>
And then, &quot;If they are using the 12-Step treatment on their patients, are they actually
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">killing more people

Now if they are not foisting 12-Step quackery on sick people, then they are really

From:  	&quot;Trish R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	treatment availability &#8212; Mental Health v. Drug<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

I was watching the Andrea Yates re-trial on Court TV.  Even though she
was diagnosed with serious mental illness before she killed the kids
[prescribed antidepressants &amp; antipsychotics], the only inpatient
treatment her insurance covered was a few days at a facility whose focus
was treatment for drug users.  [Keep in mind that at the time Rusty
worked for NASA; you'd think he'd have decent insurance].

<p>

While science has improved diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases,
access to such treatment is getting harder to come by &#8212; even with
insurance.  Meanwhile, the mental health parity movement is working to
change state laws to force health insurance to cover drug treatment for
as long as the insured would like to spend in the facility.

<p>

I suspect that wherever &quot;mental health parity&quot; becomes law, that people
like Andrea Yates are not going to find it easier to get the
evidence-based scientific medicine that they need.  And that drug rehab
centers will multiply like fungus.

<p>

The thing that bothers me the most about this issue is that there is no
evidence to support [and some evidence to the contrary] that expensive
celebrity inpatient like Promises do any better at keeping people from
drinking than a free AA meeting in the nearest church basement.  So why
should our already-frail insurance system [that excludes many working
adults and many children] be forced to pay for the expensive places?

<p>

Sincerely,<br> 
Trish R.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Trish,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I couldn't agree more. The treatment centers are where
the 12-Step cult stops being &quot;a free self-help group&quot; and becomes just another
money-grubbing con. The so-called &quot;recovery industry&quot; is a $6.2 billion per year
racket that does not sober up America. &#8212; And doesn't solve the drug problems, either.
<p>
I have
<a href="orange-action.html">a web page that gives instructions</a>
on how to email your Senators and Congressperson
to oppose the &quot;HEART&quot; bill that demands that the con artists get even more money.
Please send some emails, and tell our politicians that it is time for the government
to stop paying frauds and charlatans to foist quack medicine and cult religion on
sick people. Demand that drug and alcohol treatment programs be tested,
just like all other medical treatments are, to eliminate the ineffective cures
and quack potions.

<p>
And have a good day.

Subject:  	motivation for 12 step article<br>

<p>

I have read your article on the effectiveness of the 12 step program. I
am desperately seeking help for my alcoholic husband who is having
serious medical problems (pancreatis). He committed himself to hospital
detox and treatment but is hesitant to embrace the 12 step programs they
espouse. It is a well respected program.  My question to you is who are
you and what is your background? Can I trust your assessment? My husband
would work with his councelor one on one and I need to know that if I
agree to this I am not putting him in additional harm.
<p>
Any insight into your motivation would be helpful.
<p>
D.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ruby,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
About biographical information, I have answered that question several times before.
Here is the usual list of autobiographical information:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction, my introduction to A.A.</a>, and also
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">the &quot;treatment&quot;
bait-and-switch trick</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters26.html#who_r_u">who are you</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters18.html#biography">who are you, 2</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">another friend goes missing</a>.
<li> the story about &quot;<a href="orange-ratpark.html">Rat Park</a>&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
About my motivation &#8212; I just want to get the truth out there. As you read in the
introduction, I went through a treatment program and was shocked to find that cult
religion is being sold as treatment for a life-threatening illness.
&#8212; Even here in the USA, in the 21st century.

<p>
Can you trust my assessment? Well I think so, because I try very hard to be correct
and accurate, and I seek the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
But of course I might be a little bit biased. So use your own judgement.
<p>
<a name="defects"> </a>
Personally, I don't blame your husband for being hesitant to embrace the 12-Step
routine.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">It doesn't work</a>; it just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>, and
it is a
<a href="orange-heresy.html">grossly heretical cult religion</a>.
A.A. has also displayed several other nasty side effects like
causing:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a higher rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">a higher rate of re-arrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">higher costs of hospitalization</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">a higher suicide rate</a>.
</ul>

<p>
Another thing that your husband may well object to is the contempt that Alcoholics Anonymous
actually feels towards alcoholics. That may seem contradictory, because A.A. claims
that it loves alcoholics and exists to help them, and A.A. has slogans like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let us love you until you can love yourself.&quot;<br>
</font>
But it is true. A.A. actually has
great contempt for alcoholics and treats them in an arrogant condescending manner.
The founder of A.A., Bill Wilson, had great problems with self-hatred, so he projected
his hatred onto a stereotypical alcoholic, and declared,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Look at how disgusting he is.&quot;<br>
</font>
See the file &quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">The <i>Us
Stupid Drunks</i> Conspiracy</a>&quot; for a long list of A.A.'s
slurs and sneers at alcoholics.

<p>
You said that the program in question is &quot;well respected&quot;. Respected by whom?
What do they know? How truthful are they? Do they have an ulterior motive or an ax to grind?
Do they have a financial interest in the treatment center?
(Watch out for that
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#passive_voice">use of the passive voice</a>
&#8212; that is a popular propaganda trick.)
<p>
All of the treatment centers brag that they are great, even if they are terrible frauds
that dispense quackery.
They routinely deceive and exaggerate to create an impression of success that they
don't get. 
<a href="orange-letters26.html#treatment_success">Read this description of treatment
center deceit</a>.

<p>
You might also read this woman's experiences with
<a href="orange-letters11.html#seven_rehabs">Seven rehabs,
seven chances to get cheated</a>,
and
another fellow's experiences &#8212;

Subject: The Big Lie Continues<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

I have followed your site for years. You have done a fantastic job
researching and shedding light on one of the Big Lies of our age &#8212; the
lie that 12 step based treatment works. I am a Hazelden alum who
experienced (and survived) the Big Lie. After my 28 days, I gave up
drinking on my own and went on to simply live my life taking care of my
family and pursuing my interests.  No spiritual awakening, no moral
inventory, no meetings. Just a life full of pursuits of my own choosing.

<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>

A few days ago, the New York Times published an article about
pharmaceutical treatments for addiction being developed using cutting
edge brain research. The following quote was published, probably in the
interests of balance:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;John Schwarzlose, the president of the Betty Ford Center, says he isn't
convinced that treating alcoholics and drug addicts with more drugs &#8212;
particularly if they aren't proved effective &#8212; is a good idea. He points
out that millions of addicts around the world have recovered without the
help of medication. &quot;We're open to medications that will actually work,
but the fact is that today 12-step treatment is still the best treatment
there is,&quot; he told me. &quot;Nothing even comes close. And until something
does, we like to try to keep most of our patients as drug-free as
possible.&quot;&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

This statement went completely unchallenged in the article. I
particularly liked the &quot;treatments with no proven effectiveness&quot; part.
Could he be any more disingenuous? Will we ever escape the 12 step
propaganda machine? The work you do in exposing the AA machine is very
important. People need to see that the power to defeat the addiction
beast is within them. They do not need &quot;support&quot; from proto-fascist
groups filled with sociopaths.

<p>

Keep up the good work.

Hi Margo,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. And thanks for the compliments.

I looked up that article, and
immediately wrote this letter to the editor at the New York Times:

Dear People,

<p>

The NYT Magazine published, on June 25, an article &quot;An Anti-Addiction Pill?&quot;, which
discussed pharmaceutical treatments for alcoholism.

<p>

A comment from John Schwarzlose, the president of the Betty Ford Center, declared,
&quot;... the fact is that today 12-step treatment is still the best treatment there is.
Nothing even comes close.&quot;

<p>

The author of the article, Benoit Denizet-Lewis, did not challenge that statement.
He should have. That statement is so untrue that it is the exact opposite of the truth.
The 12-Step treatment is a proven failure. Nothing is worse. Even no treatment or help
at all is better than the 12 Steps.

<p>

Every time Alcoholics Anonymous and its 12-Step program
have been put to the test in valid medical studies, it has failed miserably.
Dr. Jeffrey Brandma found that A.A. greatly increased the rate of binge drinking
in alcoholics &#8212; alcoholics sent to A.A. were doing five times as much binge drinking
as those who got no treatment or help, and nine times as much bingeing as those who got
Rational Behavior Therapy. Dr. Keith S. Ditman found that A.A. increased the rate
of rearrests in street drunks over those who got no help.
Dr. Diana C. Walsh found that A.A. really messed up
some alcoholics and made them require more expensive treatment later.

<p>

The most damning information of all came from a doctor who is currently a member of
the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc., Doctor and Professor
of Psychology at Harvard University George E. Vaillant. He spent nearly 20 years
treating alcoholics with Alcoholics Anonymous and its 12 Steps, and wrote up the
results in his book, &quot;The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and
Paths to Recovery&quot;. Vaillant found that A.A. was no better than no treatment at all
and raised the death rate. A.A. had the highest death rate of any treatment that
Vaillant studied. After 8 years of A.A., 29% of Vaillant's patients were dead.
Vallant wrote: &quot;After initial discharge, only five patients in the Clinic
sample never relapsed to alcoholic drinking, and there is compelling
evidence that the results of our treatment were no better than the natural
history of the disease. ... Not only had we failed to alter the natural
history of alcoholism, but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.&quot;
(Pages 283-286.)

<p>

And yet, Vaillant still wants all alcoholics shoved into A.A. anyway, because
he thinks that it is a wonderful cult, one where alcoholics will get an &quot;attitude
change ... by ... confession of sins to a high-status healer.&quot; (Pages 286-288.)

<p>

In his sequel to the first book, Vaillant also wrote: &quot;...AA certainly
functions as a cult and systematically indoctrinates its members in ways
common to cults the world over.  ...in the absence of proven scientific
efficacy, critics are legitimate in suggesting that mandated AA attendance
may be criticized as a failure of proper separation between church and
state.&quot; (&quot;The Natural History Of Alcoholism Revisited&quot;, page 266.)

<p>

What the President of the Betty Ford Center did not tell you is that they charge
$15,000 for a 28-day introduction to the 12-Step cult religion. They have a vested
interest in continuing business as usual.

From:  	&quot;John M.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	A.A. as a social outlet<br>

<p>

Hi, I am writing back to tell you how much I still enjoy reading your
site and letters. Like a recent writer to you, I continue to go while
not believing a word they have to say because I guess that I also am
a sucker for the vast PR machine and really don't want to relapse no
matter what and so am hedging my bets.  I wrote before about using
A.A. as a social group and have been doing so, but like you predicted
it becomes more and more difficult as I am constantly forced to be
dishonest about how I actually feel or  think; in reality this is not
an especially good basis for lasting friendships.
<p>
I figured out the
other day that in the past twenty-four years (when I first got sober
after a very bad case of alcoholism that included years of daily,
constant blackout drinking and ending in delirium tremors strapped to
a bed in Seattle: just added that so no one could say that I wasn't
an alcoholic and so discount my experience.) I have actually only
been a practicing alcoholic for nine months (four short relapses),
this may be why I am so unable to buy into this, I never used A.A.
before and no matter what people say I was not a &quot;dry drunk&quot;, I got
in and stayed in a relationship for over twenty years now, have
traveled around the world, had a career, bought homes, etc... you
know &quot;normal life&quot;
<p>
I do not honestly believe that my mind is
inherently different from people who are not addicts, when I am not
drinking I am no different from others.  A.A. insists that I am
different and need treatment for my insanity.  How they want to treat
me is the 12 step program; my question is &quot;what program?&quot;...  This is no
more a program than basing your life on the New York Times
horoscope.
<p>
As you have so rightly pointed out most steps are
inherently inconsistent alone, and completely incomprehensible as a
system.
<p>
I think you do some disservice to some of the other cults
which have a spiritual program since though I would never subscribe
to them at least the theory behind them makes some sense; example;
the Hari Krishna program is at least loosely based on bhakti yoga and
has a definite outcome; you become one with God, while I would never
shave my head and wear saffron robes, this at least is spiritual
(sort of).
<p>
A.A. talks about spirituality without ever defining it,
allowing every member to come up with their own ideas about what it
is and then saying they have had a spiritual awakening.  Without
belaboring the point I will just address this 12th step
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;having had a
spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry
this message to other alcoholics&quot;</font>
<p>
Why would God only want alcoholics
to share in a spiritual awakening? Why not everyone?  Surely neither Buddha
nor Jesus ended his sermons with
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;By the way don't tell my message to
non-indians (or non-jews)&quot;</font>.

<p>
well I guess it's time I expanded my
horizons; if I am only going for social reasons I should probably
just join the Sierra Club and other organizations that do things I
actually like.
<p>
Thanks for all the letters, I mention your site to
anyone I meet that seems unconvinced; I just tell them that they
should hear all sides.  I do not believe that God gave me a brain in
order for me not to use it.
<p>
Thanks again,<br>

Subject:  	P.S.<br>

<p>

Just want to clarify that I am in no way advocating the Hari Krishnas
or any other cult, it just happens that there is a Krishna temple
down the street from my house and I was thinking how similar their
approach to deviation is to that of alcoholics anonymous; if you have
a thought that disagrees with their basic principles you just chant
mindlessly the hari krishna mantra until the thought goes away, in
A.A. their mantra for deviant thinking is &quot;get a sponser, work the
steps, keep coming back&quot;.  Just wanted to point out that at least
some of the other religious cults at least have some basis in a
spiritual tradition.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for a great letter. And thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
As you can imagine, I agree with everything that you have said.
<p>
And I get your point about the Hari Krishnas. I also studied them for the
<a href="orange-cult.html">Cult Test</a>, and they are a fascinating subject.
You are right about them having a root or basis in real spiritual traditions.
The Hindu religion is for real, and is much more genuine and sophisticated than
Buchmanism, on which A.A. is based.
<p>
Unfortunately, the religion in the Hari Krishnas got twisted and perverted.
The same thing happened with yoga
in the 3HO &#8212; Yogi Bhajan's &#8212; organization, and in Swami Muktananda's group too &#8212;
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Siddha_Yoga">SYDA &#8212; &quot;Siddha Yoga&quot;</a>.
And the Christianity got twisted in Jim Jones's People's Temple.
That just seems to be a hallmark of cults &#8212; the religion always gets twisted and perverted.

<p>
I have been especially interested in following the career of Nori Muster, who wrote
a fascinating book about her ten years of subservience in the Hari Krishnas &#8212;
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Nori_Muster"><i>Betrayal of the Spirit</i></a>.
(That bibliographic entry gives links to several quotes.)
<p>
Alas, she is falling for the old cult religion come-on yet again. Now she is declaring
that the 12 Steps help in recovery from cults. No joke. She is actually pushing that viewpoint.
We discussed that 
<a href="orange-letters43.html#Nori_Muster">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters49.html#Nori_Muster">here</a>, a little while ago.
<p>
She escaped from one cult, and now she is getting drawn into yet another one.
<p>
It is painful to see &#8212; it is like watching a disastrous train wreck in
slow motion and there is nothing that you can do to stop it.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	laura c.<br>
Subject:  	Comments about Orange Papers and AA<br>

<p>
Hello there!

<p>
I was just perusing your Orange Papers and thought I'd drop you a line
and let you know what newly developed &quot;problem drinkers&quot; (I don't like
referring to the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot; because I feel that considering
it a disease is just an excuse) feel about the entire AA phenomena. It's
a disappointment, a horror really, for those who are desperate for REAL
advice and help.

<p>
I developed a drinking problem over a rather short period of time. I had
gastric bypass surgery and about a year later, started using alcohol as
a substitute where I'd used food before. Purely self-abuse, lack of
control, self-destructive behavior. I was shocked at how quickly it got
out of control and how difficult it was to stop. So I sought help. As you
know, the most widely available help is AA. I knew nothing about it and
everyone I knew...  mostly people who had never been to a meeting, had no
clue what the twelve steps were, and never had more than two glasses of
wine a year...  insisted that it was the ONLY way for anyone to ever get
and stay sober.

<p>
I found that AA was very accessible at almost any hour of the day. Since
I was in &quot;crisis mode&quot; I ran off to meetings desperately looking for
help. I didn't get any real help, of course.

<p>
<a name="sex"> </a>
Firstly, I'm stricken by how firmly AA has held on to it's lecherous,
predatory roots of older men attempting to take advantage of vulnerable
women seeking help. After attending only a handful of meetings it became
clear to me that I could only possibly attend women-only meetings. I
found it hilarious to read your comments on Bill W. taking advantage of
young women. Since people seek AA meetings in the worst possible
state... vulnerable, miserable, wanting something to cling to... I find
this behavior intolerable and cruel and predatory (my favorite word to
describe trying to pick up women you KNOW are psychologically damaged
and down).

<p>
Second, I understand the concept that all addictions can have some of
the same roots and symptoms. But because the local (or perhaps this is
more than a local phenomena) NA chapters are so fraught with problems,
such as people attending NA to buy drugs, local AA meetings are more
than 75% filled with drug addicts. 

<p>
At first, I gave myself a firm talking to, explaining to myself that I'm
no better than a heroin addict, we're both doing self-destructive
things, &quot;there but for the grace of a god I don't really believe in go
I&quot; and so forth. However, it quickly became clear that I do NOT have
much in common with a heroin/cocaine/oxycontin addict and their
treatment generally does not pertain to me.

<p>
These drugs are not a normal part of society that educated people
generally agree are socially acceptable. There is a big difference
between seeking a crack house and entering to make an illegal purchase
and accepting the glass of wine you're offered with your lunch. There
are no billboards for cocaine, no signs in bar windows advertising
heroin. Unlike Cocaine, there IS a safe amount of alcohol. These things
are neither here nor there... I'm not suggesting either drugs or alcohol
are harder or easier to quit. I'm just mentioning that sitting in
meetings or &quot;therapy&quot; geared toward Oxycontin addicts has little or no
value to me and only serves to give drug dealers the opportunity to ask
me out for &quot;coffee.&quot;

<p>
Another issue I have that I don't believe you've touched on much (if at
all) in the Orange Papers is this: If it took you 30 years to figure out
how to quit drinking, I have nothing to learn from you. I don't plan to
waste 30 years of my life finding a solution and you are an idiot for
doing so.&quot; Forgive me for being so harsh...  the long-time drinker who
finally finds a way to quit has my empathy and kudos for finally finding
a way out. But I want to learn from someone who figured it out afer 6
months. I don't WANT to listen to horror stories about someone who was
stupid enough to lose four houses, three wives, eight children and 14
cars before he finally decided to stop. This has nothing to do with
me...  I don't believe ANYONE can really learn anything from someone so
thick.

<p>
AA meetings generally lean entirely in the opposite direction... they
actually REVERE extremely long-term drinkers. It seems the more of your
life you've wasted, the more you've destroyed, the higher you're held in
regard. &quot;Oh, Johnny was SO down-and-out, lost his law practice, was
living under a bridge, and after 26 years he managed to quit his habit
and start to regain a normal life.&quot; Good for Johnny...  but once I've
determined that I don't want to end up living under a bridge, there is
no more this story can do for me. Now, if I could just talk to someone
who quit drinking BEFORE it destroyed their lives...  that would really
help me out!

<p>
My problem, I've been told, is that I suffer from &quot;terminal uniqueness.&quot;
Yes! Yes I do! I firmly believe that listening to drunkalogs (the longer
and more horrible and more gory the better) may help some people. Maybe
it reminds them why they don't want to drink, maybe it keeps them away
from alcohol or drugs in some other manner. But it does not work for me
and is not relevant for me.

<p>
All the AA members I've met believe I'm lying about my drinking history.
When I tell someone that I developed a problem over the last year or
so...  got cut lose socially after a huge weight loss, substitued one bad
habit for another...  they look at me like I'm crazy. They quickly
admonish me that they are CERTAIN family members or others noticed that
I had a problem prior to the time I identified it. &quot;No,&quot; I tell them, &quot;I
did NOT have a problem prior to this.&quot; They just shake their heads and
repeat some over-used clich&eacute; or mantra, accusing me of that terminal
uniqueness I mentioned and telling me that I just &quot;don't get it.&quot;

<p>
That's right. I don't get it. I don't believe that if I DO have a
disease that it can be called &quot;alcoholism.&quot; Self-destructiveness? Maybe.
Addictive tendencies? Sure. Depression? Anti-depressants got rid of my
desire to self-destruct, so maybe that IS it. Impulsive behavior? Is
that a disease? I might have that. But I don't understand how anyone can
lump all problem drinkers into ONE disease category and demand that they
can all be cured in the same flawed manner with no professionals
involved. And I'm finding that most people even want to lump ALL
addictions into this category, not just drinking.

<p>
People want to escape for different reasons. People become addicted for
different reasons...  sometimes they're physical, sometimes emotional,
sometimes related to mental illness. As you mention, everyone has a
different history, so what's the deal with demanding that we all give up
our uniqueness when it comes to being treated for any problems we have?
If the AA member wants to call it a disease like cancer, don't they
realize how many different types of cancer there ARE? Surely people who
sit in those AA meetings realize that not every diabetic requires the
same dose of insulin or even requires insulin in the same form.

<p>
I've determined that my &quot;treatment&quot; for whatever &quot;disease&quot; I might have
does not require a life sentence of sitting around with drunks and drug
users. It requires that I find NORMAL friends and have a NORMAL life. It
demands that I replace bad behavior with good behavior and that good
behavior doesn't involve listening to someone else's drunken nightmares.

<p>
I've gone on much longer than I intended. I guess I'm very angry with
the entire AA organization for holding itself out as a great HOPE for
people who need help an then not really offering any help. The problem
drinker who is desperately looking for a way out feels horrified when
they find out what AA is really offering is a way IN...  and in to a way
of life that requires that life sentence of defining yourself as an
addict and living out your days in and around your addiction.

<p>
No thanks. I'm going to spend my life doing healthy things instead.

<p>
Thank you for the outlet for my frustrations!

<p>

I just want to say thank you again and again.  I am de-programming from
AA and doing fairly well.  But it's not been easy.  I'm writing my own
essays about my experience which have proved quite cathartic.
Hopefully, I'll be able to fine-tune them some and share them with others.

<p>

I've also found some personal essays online from people who have tried
AA and have moved on.  They seem to be doing pretty well.  In case you
haven't caught these, here they are:

From:  	&quot;noel b.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	How it works<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

Hope you are enjoying a fantastic day.

<p>

The line in &quot;How it Works&quot;, &quot;Those who do not recover are people who cannot
or will not give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women
who are constutionally incapable of being honest with themselves&quot;, is a
brutal line for at least two reasons. As you say in your documents many a
newcomer (and even more established members) can get put on a dangerous
guilt trip. Since Wednesday (28 June), I've noticed three members talking
about feeling like taking their own lives, while the Big Bookers prescribe
them the &quot;spiritual&quot; opium of the programme.

<p>

The second reason is perhaps even more insidious. It is a confidence trick
that works like this. If you have been dishonest during your drinking, and
the Big Book has pointed this out, then what the Big Book says is true.
Sadly, this is one giant illusion with many members following this illusion
through the gates of insanity or death.

<p>

Orange, I'm detoxing from the 12 steps and I hope to be free on 13 October
2006.

<p>

It is nearly 16:00 GMT and my siesta is about to end and I'll get out and
enjoy the evening.

<p>

God bless you.

Hello again

I was having a seance the other day, when suddenly I got talking to Bill
Wilson. He said it was very hot where he was and the conversation turned to
half measures, where he showed he had lost none of his coherence and good
sense:

<p>

Me: &quot;Bill, what do half measures avail us?&quot;<br>
Bill: &quot;Nothing.&quot;    (Big Book, Chapter Five, P.58)<br>

Subject: prior sobriety movements<br>

<p>

Good morning Agent Orange,

<p>
I Think your site is wonderful.  It is one of the most comprehensive
and best documented histories of AA and the Oxford group on the web.
Keep up the good work.

<p>
While still involved in AA, I was amazed after hearing a Seneca Indian
giving a lead.  He mentioned that he was a member of the Longhouse
religion which contains the Code of Handsome Lake.  He gave credit to
Bill W's program for the first program for sobriety.  When I searched
Handsome Lake later that night, I discovered his code was derived from a
vision he had when ill.  Part of it was that he should stop drinking
alcohol and reform his life to serving his community.

<p>
I know Bill W. in his grandiose style has claimed to find a solution
&quot;to the age old problem of alcoholism.&quot;  I have seen a number of letters
criticizing your site mentioning he was the first/only to do so.
Besides Handsome Lake I am also aware of the Washingtonians. Do you
have any info on other movements/programs through out history?

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Denny



<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Dennis,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And yes, I also investigated Bill Wilson's
grandiose claims of being the first to find a solution. Nothing could be further from
the truth. Actually, everything about Alcoholics Anonymous was copied from some
earlier cult religion or temperance movement, starting with the Oxford Group and
continuing with a long list of previous societies. See this short history of previous
temperance unions, movements, and treatment programs:<br>

On the morning of the 4th of July, I was listening to the Al Franken show on
Air America, and was distressed to hear Al Franken bringing on the author of the
screenplay of the made-for-TV movie
&quot;<a href="orange-letters54.html#My_Name_Is_Bill_W">My Name Is Bill W.</a>&quot;,
which is a shameless piece of lying A.A. propaganda. Both Al Franken and the author
parrotted a lot of the usual A.A. misinformation, like that A.A.
was the best way to treat alcoholism, and the only thing that really works.
I expect better than that from Al Franken. He is supposed to be checking the
facts and telling the truth. I immediately posted this letter to
his web site:

Dear Al,
<p>
I was saddened to hear your unquestioning praise of Alcoholics Anonymous
on your July 4th show. You are smart enough to figure out when Bush is
lying to you, so why can't you figure out that Alcoholics Anonymous is
a lying cult religion that isn't all that much different from Scientology
or the Moonies?

<p>
The made-for-TV movie &quot;My Name is Bill W.&quot; was a gross fabrication,
and largely untrue. Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith didn't start A.A.
in 1935; they started recruiting for the Oxford Group cult religion in 1935.
Both Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith were enthusiastic members of the
Oxford Group cult, and they believed that the Oxford Group had the only
cure for alcoholism, which was &quot;become a religious fanatic&quot;
&#8212; &quot;The only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;

<p>
Bill W. and Dr. Bob went to Akron hospitals and forced Oxford-Group-style
religious conversions on sick alcoholics, no matter whether the patients
wanted conversion or not.  See:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-letters54.html#AA_movie">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-letters54.html#AA_movie</a>
for much more on that.

<p>
They didn't have any great success rate with alcoholics by using their
so-called &quot;spiritual&quot; method. Bill and Dr. Bob calculated that
they only had a 5% success rate.  But that is the normal rate of spontaneous
remission in alcoholics. That's how many alcoholics will successfully
quit drinking all on their own, without any &quot;help&quot;.  See:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial&quot;">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial</a>

<p>
The Oxford Group was notoriously pro-Nazi. The leader of the cult,
Dr. Frank Buchman, came back from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and
declared to a New York newspaper, &quot;I thank heaven for a man like
Adolf Hitler, who built a front line of defense against the anti-Christ
of Communism.&quot; Frank Buchman never criticized Adolf Hitler, not
even for the holocaust. See:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-rroot240.html">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-rroot240.html</a>
for much more on that.

<p>
Neither Bill Wilson nor Dr. Bob quit the Oxford Group in protest when
Frank Buchman praised Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler as wonderful fellows.

<p>
Unfortunately, the theology of the Oxford Groups is still the
theology of Alcoholics Anonymous today:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-religiousroots.html">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-religiousroots.html</a>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is not the best treatment for alcoholism. It is the
absolute worst. Even no treatment or help is better than Alcoholics
Anonymous. A.A. does not even have a success rate; it has a death rate.
One of the leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous, Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant,
who is now a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
Services, Inc., proved that when he tried to show that A.A. works. After
8 years of A.A. treatment, 29% of Dr. Vaillant's patients were dead.  See this:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160712112438/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a>

<p>
Other doctors have found that A.A. increases the rate of binge drinking,
increases the rate of re-arrests for public drunkenness, and even messes
up alcoholics so that they require more expensive hospitalization later.

Date: 	Tue, 04 Jul 2006 19:44<br>
From: 	&quot;Gene L.&quot; <br>
Subject: 	Tunks<br>

<p>

Before you start saying Rev Tunks was in th O.G., better check with his
draughter that lives here in Tampa and is a very good frined of mine.
Know your facts or don't tell nothing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Gene,
<p>
Perhaps you should follow your own advice. This is what the official council-approved
history of Alcoholics Anonymous says. The setting is the famous scene where
Bill Wilson was in the Mayflower Hotel in Akron, in the spring of 1935, telephoning
to find some alcoholic to talk to. Bill looked at a plaque on the wall, and:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Bill looked over the names and, quite at random, singled out that of a Reverend
Walter F. Tunks. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; Whatever Bill's reason, he unwittingly picked the
strongest Oxford Grouper among all of Akron's clergymen.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>'PASS IT ON': The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message
reached the world</i>, Authorship credited to 'anonymous';
actually written by A.A.W.S. staff<br>
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), New York, 1984, page 136.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Rev. Walter Tunks gave Bill Wilson the name of another O.G. member
who gave Bill ten numbers to call. Number ten was Henrietta Seiberling, another
Oxford Group member.
<p>
Henrietta's response?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Her silent reaction, she said, was: &quot;This is really manna from heaven.&quot;
Aloud, she said, &quot;You come right out here.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
It may seem remarkable that a woman alone with three teenage children would be so quick
to invite a strange man into her home. But there was a strong bond of trust among
Oxford Group members. &nbsp; ...<br>
She was certain that the telephone call was the help she and other Oxford Group
members had been seeking for one of their members.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>'PASS IT ON': The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message
reached the world</i>, Authorship credited to 'anonymous';
actually written by A.A.W.S. staff<br>
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), New York, 1984, page 137.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Henrietta Seiberling in turn introduced Bill Wilson to Dr. Robert Smith,
who was also another Oxford Group member.
Heck, they were all members. Bill Wilson was connected up with Dr. Bob Smith by
Tunks because they were all Oxford Group members.

<p>
<a name="Hartigan1"> </a>
Likewise, the biography of Bill Wilson by Lois Wilson's private secretary,
Francis Hartigan, says about that same scene in the Mayflower Hotel:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
After trying to decide which minister was the most likely to know about
the Oxford Group, he [Bill] settled on the Reverend Walter Tunks.
Like Sam Shoemaker, Tunks was the rector of an Episcopalian church.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he called, he learned that the Reverend Walter Tunks was himself an Oxford Group
member.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan,
page 76.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Walter Tunks was one of the founding members of the Akron Oxford Group. As such,
he was someone of whom Sam Shoemaker and other New York Oxford Group members
were certainly aware. As for Henrietta Seiberling, given the Oxford Group's penchant
for celebrity and Tunks's position in the Akron Oxford Group chapter, that Tunks
himself did not know Henrietta Seiberling and her efforts to help Robert Smith
seems hardly credible.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan,
page 77.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Remember that the Oxford Group got established in Akron because some Groupers
succeeded in temporarily sobering up Russell Firestone, the prodigal son of the tire millionaire
Harvey Firestone. The senior Firestone was so grateful that he bankrolled a
big O.G. campaign in Akron that established an enduring chapter.
The Akron Oxford Group had an established history and practice of
working with alcoholics, so Rev. Tunks wasn't overly surprised by
Bill Wilson asking to speak with another alcoholic.
<p>
So, another of Bill Wilson's biographers wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Because of Tunks's Oxford Group affiliation, he was familiar with reformed
drunkards, and he was unreservedly receptive to Wilson's seemingly bizarre
request that he needed help making contact with another alcoholic.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Bill W. and Mr. Wilson &#8212; The Legend and Life of A.A.'s Cofounder</i>,
Matthew J. Raphael, page 100.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now Gene, you have used the propaganda trick of innuendo: You never actually said that
the woman whom you claim is Tunks's daughter has declared that her father was not a
member of the Oxford Group. You merely implied it.
<p>
You have also not bothered to supply her name and address or phone number or email address so
that I can contact her and ask her about this. Besides, how are we to know whether this is
all a hoax, and you will just supply the number of a friend of yours who is not Tunks's daughter?
<p>
So, are you going to supply some solid information?
<p>
Alternatively, have you considered the possibility that the woman with whom you
are speaking is <i>in denial</i> and just doesn't want to admit that her father
was part of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html">a pro-Nazi cult</a>?
</font>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: 2008.10.27:<br>
There is a video on YouTube that contains a historic tape recording
where Bill Wilson himself declares that Rev. Tunks was a member of the Oxford Group:<br>

Do you have a better solution  then AA? Whatever, it has helped many men and women
return from the gates of hell to be out back with their families and jobs. I'm so
glad you have such a great memory. I have been sober for 28 years, Please don't ask
me what I was doing at 5 months sober or the first 4 years, so unless you have lived
it, you don't know what the hell you are talking about. Does me good to see people
like you, help me to vent some of my angery out...that you ah.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Gene,
<p>
We have been over all of this before. Please read before criticizing.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
A.A. has not &quot;helped&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; millions.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">A.A. does not work</a>. It is a failure
with a zero-percent success rate over normal spontaneous remission.
<li>
A.A. has the highest death rate of any kind of treatment program. Nothing is worse.
That information comes straight from one of the leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, who
is a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc.

<li> A.A. also causes <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a higher rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">a higher rate of re-arrests</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">higher costs of hospitalization</a>.

<li>
A.A. is merely a cult religion that steals the credit from people who quit drinking
by their own perseverence, hard work, and determination.
</ul>

<p>
There are many good alternatives to Alcoholics Anonymous. In fact, anything is better,
and produces a lower death rate and a lower rate of binge drinking.
<a href="orange-letters57.html#alt_list">Here is a list of alternatives</a>.

You can't order it. It isn't for sale. It's for free.

What I recommend is that people download the archive files

From:         &quot;Arlene&quot;<br>
Subject: 	From Canada
<p>

Greetings Agent Orange:
<p>
I have been following your  site for over a
year now and must say it provides a lot of answers for me.  On July 13,
I will be marking my second year of sobriety.
<p>
This is my second attempt to stop drinking.
The first time was with the use of a treatment
centre and  AA; but I wasn't ready to admit I was an alcoholic and went
back drinking.  This second  phase was the result of  two spiritual
events, about a week apart;  the events of which are too lengthy to go
into here.  I was  three days sober  when I started to re-attend AA.  As
my health improved  and I regained  my old self, I began to have
problems with the Big Book and the messages I  heard in the rooms.
<p>
After discovering your site and attempting to find members to discuss
my issues with AA, I  gave up.  I have relocated recently, and have yet
to attend a meeting in my new community.  Surprise, Surprise; I have not
drank, nor have a desire to do so.
<p>
I have discovered something that
I have not seen  discussed on your site yet.   I believe that the
Fellowship of AA  has in fact superceeded the Big Book,  much to the
chargrin of the oldtimers who like to preach the 12 Steps.  I found
that  a number of the groups I attended were quite happy to talk about
living in sobriety and coping with day to day living without  using
booze.  The Big Book  was sort of  on the edge  of the picture.  AA
could work if the organization was willing to bring itself into the 21
century, and that would mean &quot;Coming of Age&quot; for a second time and
putting the Godliness of Bill W  behind itself.  However I cannot see
this happening and I have not yet decided if I will resume  attending
meetings.
<p>
Note those important words, &quot;I have not yet decided.&quot;  In
sobriety, I make the decisions that affect my life, that freedom of
choice comes from Sobriety and not from the bottom of a bottle of
whiskey.
<p>
I have observed that there is not a lot of discussion at AA
meetings about sobriety, and the Big Book only dwells on the practicing
alcoholic; with nothing about the person in sobriety. Interested in
your comments
<p>
I also have not seen any comments from Canadians, have you received
some???

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Arlene,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety and your newfound
freedom.
<p>

About the <i>Big Book</i> becoming irrelevant: A.A. seems to be going both ways
on that issue.
I have had some people write to me and declare that the <i>Big Book</i> is unimportant,
and that they have been members for years and never read the thing.
<p>
And then of course others tell me that everything that you need to know about life
is contained in the first 164 pages.
<p>
Who knows which way A.A. will go... Perhaps both ways, with some groups going one way,
and others going the other way. A.A. may splinter into sub-cults with new leaders.
There are already signs of that happening.

<p>
Comments from Canadians? Oh yes. That makes me laugh. I immediately recognized your
ISP in your email header: telusplanet.net and telus.net.
You are in Edmunton, Alberta, Canada, and someone else who shares your ISP is
<a href="orange-letters11.html#Hyderman">a crazy chiropractor
who puts on airs of being a real doctor</a> and dispenses quack medical advice
on the Internet.
We have had an ongoing debate and a running battle for years.
A few months ago he swore that he was going
to kill me &#8212; openly threatened me in the newsgroup alt.recovery.from-12-steps.
Fortunately, he's just a harmless nutcase.
<p>
And I've actually had many other comments from Canadians, but none of the rest were quite
so crazy or so spectacular.
Try using the search engine at the bottoms of the pages, and search for &quot;Canada&quot; or &quot;Canadian&quot;
and you should get a dozen or so hits, especially in the letters pages.
Then you can type a slash ("/") and a search word like
&quot;Canada&quot; or &quot;Canadian&quot; in your browser,
and it will search within the page so
that you can zero right in on what you are seeking.

<p>
Oh, by the way, did you know that I am half Canadian? Or maybe 3/4, depending on how
you look at it. My mother was Canadian all the way; my father was born in the USA but
raised in Canada because he was half Canadian himself.
Both are from London, Ontario.
So my friends still insist that I speak with a slight Canadian accent.
It's words like &quot;out&quot;, &quot;about&quot;, and &quot;egg&quot; that are the give-away.

<p>
Have a good day.
