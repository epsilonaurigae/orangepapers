<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Congratulations on your 10 years!!! You are certainly
deserving of your sobriety and happiness. I know the 12 steppers want you to
drink and die. Never give em? the satisfaction!!! I have been meaning to write
you, have started on it several times, but I never seem to be able to put my
extreme gratitude in words.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Michelle,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And I sure don't intend to give them the
satisfaction. And I've joked about that before: I am so stubborn and determined to
never give them the satisfaction that, you know what? <i>A.A. really is keeping me sober!</i>

</font>
<p>
I have 13 months of continuous sobriety and have been in AA
for 14 months. At first I was excited because both my brother and sister have
long term sobriety and love AA very much. I consider them both to be intelligent
people and respect them immensely.

<p>
Then I started hearing things that made even my foggy mind
say &quot;Huh' That doesn't seem right, feel right, that's a lie or that is just plain
stupid.&quot; I very quickly picked up on things that would be said, or at least
thought, to shut down my questions, debate or opposition, especially the idea
that since I am an alcoholic I am unable to think for myself, I'm not
rigorously honest etc., ad nauseum.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you understand. Shut down the questioning, and stop the critical thinking,
by telling you that you are not qualified to think.
The Nazis said the same thing too, you know: &quot;The average man is too stupid to
think for himself. He should just loyally obey the orders of a superior.&quot;

</font>
<p>
As the fog lifted I found myself questioning more and more
of the program. I have sincerely tried to find myself in Bill's cruel stereotype
of an alcoholic since I was told that this is the only way I could get and stay
sober and be happy. If I didn't I would surely drink and die.  I told myself all of
the things AA told me
even though I questioned their validity. While I'm neither stupid nor immoral, I
started to believe it again. Instead, I'm a person who had a lot of emotional
pain who self-medicated and got addicted to alcohol at age 39. It only took 6
years for me to drink myself almost to death. My self esteem has been damaged
by trying to fit myself into Bill's characterization of the alcoholic. I soaked
it all up like a sponge, having been abused again like my alcoholic father did,
telling me that I'm selfish, stupid, immoral, unworthy, unlovable, and abused by
my egocentric mother who shut down all communication except her own, shut down
all independent thinking. I had worked hard all my life to fight off all these
messages and find a little self esteem and all that hard work just melted away
in AA. I had no trouble with my 4th and 5th steps once I
found the right sponsor, yet I was too ashamed to admit to anyone my misgivings
and was somewhat even ashamed to admit them to myself. Even though when I first
got sober I hit the ground running trying to find a job, I now find myself  too
paralyzed with insecurity and fear to do
that.

<p>
I found this site, all this wonderful and empowering
information, and started to really challenge the information that I have been
half taking in. I started to think about my positive attributes, you know, the
ones that Bill Wilson says no alcoholic could ever have. I started thinking of
my achievements, you know, the ones that Bill Wilson says make you arrogant. I
actually started to feel good about myself again, like I could look for a job. I
could stand AA no more. I told my sponsor (a very kind and good person that I
have been fortunate enough to know after firing a couple of sick sponsors) just
some of the many reasons why I wanted out, I can't begin to tell her all of it,
it would take forever. I told her how I never spoke at Big Book and 12&amp;12
meetings, not because I'm stupid, but because I disagree. She minimized everything.
She minimized that AA is abusive and a bunch of lies and just made excuses. I showed
my brother, (who I'm indebted to because he saved my life and I now live with
him like a worthless sponge) the SMART website. He barely looked at it and said
it wasn't as good as AA. I told him AA was doing me more harm than good and I told
him I had been mentally better off when I was drinking. He wanted to now why I felt
it was harmful. But I love him and can't tell him why. It's like criticizing
someone's religion. I can't bring myself to criticize something he loves so
much, something he feels it is so wonderful and oh so spiritual. But I don't
find a system of abuse to be spiritual. And I felt guilty knowing just what their
AA thoughts were about how my thinking is so faulty and that if I left AA I
would drink and die and that they would always be expecting this to happen. So
I decided to trade my well-being for their piece of mind and announced that I
would go back to AA and commit myself to it, and they were happy. I know they
think that I'm doing what's best for me but at the same time it feels like they
are saying, &quot;Yay, she's dying inside.&quot; I feel betrayed.

<p>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
So I've made the decision to get off my medications because it's
the only way I can feel bad enough to comply with and try to fit into AA. It's
the only way I can attend and not scream. Once before, I tried to go down to
half my normal meds when my brother urged me to stop taking it. At the time, I
warned him that this could be very dangerous for me, but he still felt like it
was a good idea. I did this for one day and could not stop crying to save my
life. I wanted to die but didn't have the courage to get a gun and blow my
brains out. I was seriously considering getting extremely drunk and walking the
edge of a bridge, not jumping, just hoping to fall off. Or just walk away and
go homeless and hope someone else would kill me. Only my mental health care
professional and my sponsor know this. I told my sponsor I was going to stop
taking my meds so I could be, as the 12&amp;12 says, 'right sized' and become
compliant. She never questioned the danger in doing this. I plan to do this
next week after I fulfill a commitment. I hope I don't kill myself. My brother
noticed my depression yesterday. He thinks I'm having a problem with sobriety.
I have no problem with not drinking. It's the 'solution' that I have a problem with.
I know all this sounds stupid. I know I'm not thinking correctly. Not doing
what's right for me. But AA tells me it would be selfish and arrogant to do
otherwise, and being beat down, in some sick way I believe it because I can't
stand to hurt them. I have been put in a position to either betray myself or
him. I guess I just love him more.

<p>
I see AA as being like the battered wife syndrome in so many
ways. If someone tells you that you are a piece of shit long enough, you will
believe it. In fact, you have to believe you're a piece of shit in the first
place to stay but then you just start to believe it more and more. You will
blame yourself for the abuse. Your children (newcomers) will learn to be either
the abused or the abuser.

<p>
I want to tell you my version of the Lizard Brain theory,
but I'll save that for later.

<p>
I will print this out in case I don't survive this getting
off my meds thing, so some people will know what happened. But AA will say I
didn?t work a strong enough program or that I couldn?t let go of my
resentments.

<p>
Again CONGRATULATIONS ORANGE!!!! YOU DID IT YOURSELF!!!

<p>
A HUGE FAN,

<p>

Hello Michelle,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
And please, please, please do not stop taking your medications
in order to please some Alcoholics Anonymous members.
Changing yourself, and messing up your mind just to fit into A.A.,
is another kind of suicide.
<p>
Please show your brother this letter. If you love him, then you should tell him the
truth, and this letter is a real good start. It will let him know what is going on.
If he rejects what you are saying, and
just starts criticizing you and putting you down,
and telling you that you cannot think such thoughts,
then you will know that he loves A.A. more than he loves you.
<p>
Please think about getting another job and moving out of your brother's house.
<p>
And if your &quot;mental health care professional&quot;
doesn't have the brains to see the dangers inherent in quitting your
medications just to fit into a cult, then fire that incompetent counselor and find a good one.
<p>
Please take care of yourself first. To hell with those other people who want you to be their
mental slave.
<p>
And please try to have a good day.

We went to a lake, but there was very little wildlife there. Apparently the powerboats
scared them away. We ended up at the Fernhill Wetlands, which was amazing. The migratory
geese use it as a resting and feeding spot. I have literally never seen so many geese at
one time, in one place, in my life. Apparently, the geese really like it there because they
can rest in peace in the middle of the largest pond, and they can fly to the surrounding
farms where the farmers have already harvested their crops, and poke through the stubble
and eat grass and weeds.

<p>
Terry,

<p>
Thanks for all your help on the AA promotion vids. I am afraid that I have
been unable to get enough content for a film, however I do plan to download
all the shows/films mentioned and complete it at a later date.

<p>
In the meantime I have been looking at documentaries on cults and revisiting
the cult question with regards to AA. Have you watched Lifton's lectures on
Youtube? Whilst they don't mention AA, there are many characteristics that
can be linked. If you do a search for &quot;Destructive Cults&quot; in Google Video (I
know they are not your favourite organisation) you'll find a great summary
on the matter.

<p>
Finally, the BBC recently made a documentary challenging Scientology &#8212; they
obviously upset someone as Scientology responded with this...<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005102/http://www.freedommag.org/" target="_blank">

<p>
If you have any ideas for what to include in the
Cult film they would be much appreciated. It is going to be much longer than
my usual ones as it is such a massive subject.

<p>
Kind regards,

<p>
James G

<p>
PS: This sounds like a great book to read too &#8212; 
<i>Malignant Pied Pipers of Our Time: A Psychological Study of Destructive Cult
Leaders from Rev. Jim Jones to Osama Bin Laden</i> [Paperback]

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, James,
<p>
That Scientology web site is something else. I really don't know why we can't have
laws against such cults &#8212; other countries do. Cults like Scientology
are just criminal enterprises, genuine organized crime. Calling it a religion is just a dodge.
<p>
Yes, tracking down all of that old video footage is a big project. Perhaps some readers
have some old videotapes in their closets...
<p>
The anti-cult video sounds like a very good idea. I'll have to think about
it for a while to come up with some
suggestions.
<p>
Have a good day now.

I am really enjoying the articles &#8212; especially this one &#8212; I completely agree
that when we are getting sober and starting to actually feel good and get
our self respect back &#8212; AA wants to focus on your character defects and
shortcomings, etc. &#8212; just what I don't need &#8212; I was always good at cutting
myself down and probably apologized way too much when I was drinking &#8212; now I
just want to be happy and rejoice &#8212; no more whining and complaining, please.

<p>
Thanks so much for this website &#8212; I feel free again &#8212; just like when I
decided to stop (before another round of AA) &#8212; I know I do not want to drink
anymore and believe in self reliance more than dependency on a strange set
of rules to obey. . . .

Dear A. Orange,

<p>
Have you published any books?  I would love to get a copy.  I do not have a
laptop &#8212; and started printing out some of your Orange Papers excerpts.  If
not, I will just keep your website on my desktop &#8212; lots of good reading to
look forward to.

<p>
I have recently removed my self from the AA community &#8212; thanks again for
your exceptional insight &#8212; it just makes so much sense.  I am going to try
to purchase some of those books recommended in your Top Ten list.

<p>
Also, FYI  I was sober for 6 years (4 yrs ago) forced to go to AA by Courts
(DUI felony) I eventually relapsed &#8212; because I chose to drink again not
because of no more meetings, but this time I quit on my own and started
attending meetings again &#8212; I just forgot what it was I did not like  &#8212; .  Now
I choose not to drink ever again &#8212; my choice

<p>
Thanks for letting me have my brain back &#8212; I knew it was there.  One of the
worst things is to lose your own self-respect and belief in yourself &#8212; I
don't want anyone to take this away from me or even try &#8212; it belongs to me.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Carla

<p>
P.S. See below &#8212; my goodbye letter to my sponsor.  I also sent it to my
brothers and son &#8212; so they do not get worried about me &#8212; although, they are
all skeptics as well.

<p>
[note; spending time w/ family &amp; friends at Thanksgiving (even though
they may be drinking &#8212; get used to it) has got to be more real than
attending a Brainwashing AA retreat &#8212; whew &#8212; I lose $150 but I don't care &#8212; 
someone else can join the Clan.]

<p>
I also included the response from my sponsor &#8212; 20 years and still
brainwashed. .. . . . glad I found out early &#8212; Thanks to you and your
website!

Subject: AA is not for me &#8212; Thanks for your effort

<p>
[To Sponsor]:

<p>
I have just decided to take another path for my own peace of mind and do not
believe that AA is for me &#8212; I have found other means of support and have
decided to rejoice and be happy &#8212; I am so sick of hearing about how we need
to remove our resentments and character defects (repent our sins) &#8212; I can do
that with a priest or talk to God myself and apologize if possible to the
person if necessary &#8212; I do not hold grudges and have no problem apologizing
and usually can forgive people unless it is absolutely unforgivable.   I
have confessed my sins (I pray to God on a personal level) and apologized to
every one probably too much and have dealt with guilt and shame all my life
 &#8212; I do not need more of it instilled (just ask my brothers)  &#8212; (I also believe
most of my amends are living amends to others and myself &#8212; just by not
drinking and being truly happy makes me a better person to be around) I am
ready to live and be happy &#8212; and move on.

<p>
I love the freedom of sobriety and I do believe that God has given us free
will to choose evil or good &#8212; I choose good and I choose not to drink
alcohol (for me it is best because I cannot control alcohol consumption but
I can control not drinking) &#8212; I have a brain and it is working much better
now, I trust myself and feel happier than I have ever felt in my life
besides when my son was born (that one is hard to beat) &#8212;  when I go to
meetings they depress me and bring me down &#8212; lower my self confidence (I am
powerful when I do not drink and my life was always manageable but without
alcohol it is now much more manageable emotionally and spiritually) &#8212; not
for me &#8212; no more pity parties and put the past behind &#8212; let's live today &#8212; 
Happy &amp; Sober.

<p>
I do not believe that my sobriety and happiness is because of AA and I will
not relapse if I do not attend meetings &#8212; I believe in myself and I believe
in God &#8212; I believe in co-workers, true friends and family that love me.  I
believe in hard work and I am the only one who knows what makes Carla tic (I
have been with her for 50 years) so removing the alcohol is the best thing &#8212; 
I have living proof &#8212; I just wish I had another 50 years to live (I don't
have lots of longevity in my genes, but will see) &#8212; now that I have so much
to look forward to.  Life is beautiful and I just want to relish whatever is
left of mine.

<p>
I wish you the best and thank you and the group for allowing me to attend
your meetings &#8212; I am not judging or criticizing &#8212; Everyone has a choice and
I respect that.  Please respect mine.  Whatever keeps you sober &#8212; keep doing
it.  Enjoy Life!

<p>
Feel free to give me a call anytime.  I just do not want to do the Step work
anymore &#8212; I gave it a try but feel it is more of a brainwashing experience
to get everyone to join the group and succumb to focusing on your negative
traits and feeling mindless and helpless so you have to keep going to
meetings for the rest of your life and listening to everyone's past misery
instead of living today in true acceptance of how much better things are
when sober &#8212; a better outlook &#8212; acceptance of yourself and personal growth
for areas you want to improve &#8212; I believe that we do have our own free will
 &#8212; God gave us a choice to take responsibility for our lives and make our own
decisions.  We cannot control everything but I believe we should take credit
for our triumphs and give it our best shot.

<p>
Thanks again for putting up with me &#8212; I wish you the best of life!

will not continue sharing the journey of our Program's road is
&quot;brainwashing&quot;, then I choose to continue being brainwashed.

<p>
Whatever you feel you must do, then, I wish you all the best.  Please know
that I will miss our new-found friendship.

<p>
One final thought and I pray you remember this:

<p>
Of the 20 years I have been a part of this miraculous Program, I have never
seen Religion keep an individual sober.

<p>
I am here for you, whenever you need a friend.

<p>
Take good care and keep your wonderful joy.

<p>
Love,

Hi again, Carla,
<p>
Thank you for the letters. Congratulations on your newfound freedom and
your ongoing sobriety. Of course I couldn't agree more. Self-reliance is what really
keeps people sober, not depending on a group of drunks.
<p>
Which brings up a line in your ex-sponsor's reply:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of the 20 years I have been a part of this miraculous Program, I have never
seen Religion keep an individual sober.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a switcheroo. You never said that you were going to use religion to keep
you sober. What you actually wrote to your sponsor was:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
God gave us a choice to take responsibility for our lives and make our own
decisions.  We cannot control everything but I believe we should take credit
for our triumphs and give it our best shot.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But your sponsor couldn't stand that idea, so in her mind, your sponsor changed it to
&quot;Carla will try to use Religion (with a capital 'R') to keep her sober.&quot;
The sponsor just can't accept the idea of self-reliance and taking care of yourself.
She just cannot think of any method of sobriety other than depending on somebody or something
else.
<p>
She really has chosen the path of continued brainwashing.

<p>
In addition, your sponsor reveals that A.A. is actually backstabbing the religions in
whose basements they meet. A.A. claims to be completely compatible with any religion
 &#8212;  &quot;no conflict&quot;, they brag  &#8212;
 &quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#keep_your_religion" target="_blank">There is no friction
 among us over such matters</a>&quot; the <i>Big Book</i>
says  &#8212;  but
then they actually denounce those religions as &quot;not effective&quot;
 and &quot;won't keep you sober&quot;.
Only the A.A. religion is good enough, they really believe.
<p>
There is no paper version of the Orange Papers. What I recommend is that people download
<a href="menu1.html#archives">the archive files</a> and then make a CD copy of all
of the files.

Ah, thank you. That is a very interesting piece of history. It's kind of funny how the author starts
off with lavish praise of A.A., and even repeats some of the standard mythology, like how A.A. is based
on the teachings of Carl Jung, and then, on the last page, starts listing the faults of A.A.
It's almost as if he had to regurgitate the party line before he was allowed to start telling the truth.

<p>
Some of the lies are so blatant:
<font color="black"><i>&quot;A.A.  has no secrets but the names of its members&quot;
is a hallowed tenet</i></font>...
So does that mean that the Alcoholics Anonymous headquarters will now unlock the sealed historical archives and
let investigators see the real historical records and see what Bill Wilson really did?
<p>
Then the author repeats
<a href="orange-letters179.html#broker" target="_blank">the falsehood that Bill Wilson was a Wall Street broker</a>.
<p>
The story that Bill Wilson was only getting $25,000 from royalties is another falsehood.
Bill was getting a lot more than that, as well as a house in the country and Cadillac car and
string of mistresses, supported by the headquarters office.
The number I got is that Lois Wilson, who inherited Bill's royalties,
was getting about $900,000 per year from those royalties at the time of her death.

<p>
And of course the author repeats the mythology that Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith founded A.A.,
apparently soon after they met.
No, they both started recruiting alcoholics for Dr. Frank Buchman's
fascist <i>Oxford Group</i> cult in 1935. They would remain in the Oxford Group for years more,
before Bill Wilson was kicked out for failure to obey orders.
And then Dr. Bob would still stay in the Oxford Group for another couple of years before establishing
independent meetings.
<p>
Which brings up the interesting note that one of the members of the Board of Trustees was an arch-conservative
who was distributing literature for the John Birch Society. Well, that is consistent with the fascist,
anti-Communist, politics of Frank Buchman.
<p>
The author tells the truth about several important issues, like that A.A. will not change or update its
literature.
And his description of the leadership is devastating:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Everybody was an expert, with a cluster of ideas closed
to amendment. Bill W., the movement's traditional leader and a main
source of its spiritual inspiration,
had lost out in committee maneuvering to a policy of &quot;putting the
thing on a business basis.&quot; Committee politics took up half the working
day; gossip was venomous. In quick
succession I was told that the co-founder (in my opinion still sharp-witted
 at seventy) was senile, that a staff worker was a hypochondriac
and a committeeman a homosexual.
The accused were at pains to assure me, separately and without encouragement,
that the accusers were a nymphomaniac, a schizophrenic and a megalomaniac. I observed
nothing to substantiate any of these
charges. However, there was no inclination toward the &quot;fearless and
searching moral inventory&quot; recommended by A.A.'s Twelve Suggested
steps.
<p>
The non-alcoholic board of Trustees responsible for national policy
was ultraconservative (one member, Archibald Roosevelt, had furnished
literature for distribution by the John Birch Society) and this, I
reported, had served the movement poorly. The board's rigid conservatism
was reflected in a number of unfortunate policies, the most odious of
which was a tacit endorsement of racial segregation within
the branches.<br>

<p>
Hmmm. Do you want to bet your life on that?

Salesmanship, self-help, and surrender to a deity, or some other higher power, form
a central trinity in American popular culture, giving rise to religious movements
fueled by therapeutic strivings and therapeutic movements infused with religious
ideals. That's why it's sometimes difficult to distinguish between therapy and
religion in America. Freudianism and a tendency to regard evil as a sickness may be
anathemas to some religious beliefs, but practical, formulaic programs for personal
development are apt to offer spiritual as well as psychic fulfillment. Similarly,
religious movements aiming for broad appeal are apt to promote self-help and
self-love while preaching self-surrender and love of God.

Thanks for the tip, Richard. That is an interesting article.
This line hits the nail on the head:
<a name="Cheever"> </a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unfortunately, Cheever's account of AA demonstrates only a vague
understanding of the broader context of religious belief and personal
development movements in America, and her version of Wilson's life is familiar.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, Susan Cheever's &quot;biography&quot; of Bill Wilson,
called <i>My Name Is Bill: Bill Wilson &#8212; His Life And The Creation Of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
was a total white-wash. She even condoned and made excuses for
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Cheever1" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's practices of necromancy</a> and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Founders_Watch" target="_blank">sexual exploitation of newcomer women</a>.
(Also look
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever7" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever2" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
Susan Cheever's reward for publishing that package of lies was a Directorship on the 
Board of Directors of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency
&#8212; the NCADD &#8212; the A.A. front group that was founded by
&quot;Mrs.&quot; Marty Mann to promote Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
I'm glad to see someone at least pointing out that Cheever's book fails the reality check.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	stumbled on your web site<br>

<p>
Wow, is all I can say. You really have spent an awful long time go to
&quot;any lengths&quot; LOL to make a case that AA has failed, it's a cult etc..
one question... Why?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Chris,
<p>
The answer is:
Because A.A. is a fraud and a hoax, and hurts more people than it helps.
And promoting quack cures for a deadly disease or fatal illness is a crime.
</font>
<p>
<a name="success_rate"> </a>
Another really important question. What other &quot;treatment&quot; has a better
success rate than AA for the biggest and most misunderstood social
problem of all mankind?

<p>
<font color="blue">
What other treatment? Many, many others are better.
Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the worst ways to treat alcoholism,
and it produces one of the highest death rates of any way of treating alcohol abuse.
<p>
Professors Reid K. Hester and William R. Miller (UNM, Albuquerque &#8212;
Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology,
University of New Mexico), rated treatment modalities by success rate.
Here are the results:<br>

http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/53/1/What-works-A-summary-of-alcohol-treatment-research/Page1.html</a><br>
== The same statistics in a different format
</ul>

<p>
<indent>
Prof. Miller's biography (on the back of his book <i>Controlling Your Drinking</i>, says:
<blockquote>
Prof. William R. Miller is Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the
University of New Mexico. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Motivational
Interviewing</i>, a modern classic in the field of addiction treatment. Dr. Miller's research,
which focuses on providing a broader and more effective range of treatment approaches
for people with alcohol and drug problems, has been supported by a 15-year Research Scientist
Award from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. He is a recipient of
the international Jellinek Memorial Award for excellence in alcoholism research.
</blockquote>
</indent>

<p>
I don't have Prof. Hester's biography handy, but I'm sure that it is also impressive.
<p>
The most successful treatment in that chart is &quot;Brief Intervention&quot;.<br>
<p>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.
<p>
&quot;Brief Intervention&quot; consists of a real doctor talking to the
patient for usually less than one hour, questioning him about all of the
ugly details of his drinking and telling him that he will die if he doesn't
quit drinking.  One time.
That's it. No long counseling sessions, no great guidance, no on-going
advice, no shoulder to cry on. And no 28-day treatment program.
Just one &quot;Dutch Uncle&quot; session and it's over.
And that's the most effective thing going.
<p>
That kind of puts the whole expensive &quot;drug-and-alcohol treatment
industry&quot; to shame, doesn't it?
<p>
Plenty of other medical tests have also shown that A.A. is a complete failure as a
treatment for alcoholism:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a> found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics. People who were sent to
A.A. ended up, after 9 months of A.A., doing FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got no such help, and NINE TIMES as much
binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for public drunkenness
in a group of street drunks.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a> that
&quot;free&quot; A.A.  just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
make them need more expensive hospitalization later.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
Doctors Orford and Edwards conducted the largest and most expensive test of A.A. in England</a>.
They found that having a doctor talk to alcoholics and their wives for only one hour, only one time,
telling them to quit drinking or they would die,
was just as effective as a whole year of A.A.-based treatment.

<p>
<li>
This one is the most damning evidence of all, because it came from a doctor
who loves Alcoholics Anonymous, and is one of its biggest promoters.
He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous [World]
Services, Inc..
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>
(who later became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
while he tried to prove that A.A. works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based treatment
program had a zero-percent success rate above
normal spontaneous remission, and worse, it had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
At the end of 8 years, the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients
was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
</ol>

</font>
<p>
By the way, your statistics on AA's success or lack of it are
impossible to calculate. Wherever you got them, they are wholly
inaccurate as the success rate of AA will always be impossible to
calculate.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Please prove that statement. Let's see your numbers. You cannot dismiss my numbers,
and many doctors' numbers, without even knowing
what the truth is, so let's see your version of &quot;the truth&quot;, and let's see how you calculated what
the truth is.
<p>
Your statement is self-contradictory. You are claiming that you cannot calculate the
A.A. failure rate, so you don't know what the truth is. But you are also claiming that
what I have said is wrong, because you do know what the truth is, and my statements disagree
with your ideas of the truth. You can't have it both ways.

<p>
It most assuredly is possible to calculate the A.A. failure rate.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Hartigan1" target="_blank">Even Bill Wilson
and Dr. Bob did it in Akron</a>, and they calculated that they had a 95% failure rate.
They found that they got a mere 5% success rate, which is the same as the success rate of people
who go it alone, and quit on their own without A.A. or any &quot;help&quot;
or &quot;treatment&quot;.
</font>
<p>
AA is not without it's problems, in my view the biggest problem is
that not enough people in the fellowship (which is different than the
program by the way) really study the text. AA's biggest problem is
it's made up of many many alcoholics who think they know what the
program is from hearing about it yet from other people who think they
know what the program is etc.. etc..

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. Reading and studying the book of lies that Bill Wilson wrote is not a cure for addictions.
<p>
You speak of &quot;the program&quot; as if A.A. actually had a program that really works.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">It does not, and never did</a>.
&quot;The Program&quot;, as you call it, is just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">some recycled old cult religion practices from
Frank Buchman</a>,
who was a pro-Nazi nutcase in the nineteen-thirties.
Bill Wilson joined Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot; cult in December of 1934, and learned
all of Buchman's crazy religious ideas there, and Bill just kept on using them when he stole &quot;The Alcoholic
Squadron&quot; and made it into his own cult.
</font>
<p>
<a name="Joe_Charlie"> </a>
Friend you've got it so wrong, I really pity you. Pick up a big book
and study AGAIN and listen along to a big book study seminar by a
couple of old drunks called &quot;Joe and Charlie&quot;. They will set you
straight. Friend, you really don't have any idea what it's all about.
You have completely missed the idea.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I've read the <i>Big Book</i> enough. I feel like I have typed half of it.
It is a pack of lies, deceptions, logical fallacies, and propaganda tricks.
And reading Joe and Charlie won't &quot;set me straight&quot;, either.
Neither will reading the cult religion diatribes of L. Ron Hubbard or Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
Why would I want to get indoctrinated by more cult religion salesmen?
</font>
<p>
Most people just look for what they want to see as is your case ...
looking askance  and looking for the bad.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And some people look for the truth about all things, and notice that there are some big lies going around.
Alcoholics Anonymous, Scientology, Synanon, The People's Temple, they all claim to have a
&quot;spiritual&quot; cure for drug and alcohol problems, and they are all frauds and cults.
</font>
<p>
BTW AA is the best thing that ever happened to me. I'd be dead with
out the program of AA (I would be OK with or without the fellowship)

<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>Correction:</b> You would have died if you had not quit drinking.
You don't even know what would have happened if you had quit drinking
and gone and done something else.
You could have quit drinking and joined a monastery, or joined the Navy,
or gone mountain climbing.
Or you could have quit drinking and joined a non-drinking church and
become a true believer in that church. You could have joined the Mormons, or the Seventh-Day 
Adventists, or Jehovah's Witnesses, or one of the dry sects of the Southern Baptists.
What would have happened then?
<p>
When you say,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I'd be dead with
out the program of AA (I would be OK with or without the fellowship)
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
...you are repeating another standard A.A. dodge. A.A. promoters routinely
switch back and forth between claiming that the magic is in the <i>Big Book</i>,
or in the Fellowship.
When I talk about the bad things that many A.A. members do, like
sexual predation and telling newcomers not to take their medications,
the A.A. defenders claim that that doesn't really matter because the magic is in The Book
and the 12 Steps and &quot;The Program&quot;.
When I point out all of the insane things that Bill Wilson wrote in
the <i>Big Book</i>,
and that the 12 Steps are just a rehash of Frank Buchman's Nazi philosophy,
they switch to claiming that the magic is in the contemporary Fellowship, and that
old history is irrelevant, and they never even read the book.

<p>
Congratulations for choosing to get yourself sober, and then keeping yourself sober.
You did it. No cult religion did it for you.

<p>
Have a good day.

  They say they have written to you and are awaiting a response. Just to
  let you know. It is very hard to get these people to engage so I hope
  you take this opportunity to sock it to them.
<p>
 
  There is a link to this question on the site, stinkin-thinkin. I hope you
  have time to look at st occasionally.

<p>
Hello there.  I am watching the conversation on aacultwatch.  It is so rare for
these people to engage with their detractors that I am surprised to read that they
feel they have dealt with your (ahem) objections.  I have flagged this up on stinkin
thinkin and will watch with interest.  I wonder whether you look at stinkin thinkin.
I think that it is going fairly well, and ftg and ma are very good writers.  (Once
again, much gratitude for your work).

Hi again, Katherine,
<p>
I poked into the delphi forum, and said hi, and got no response. And haven't been back since.
<p>
I am just not online much (no DSL connection any more),
and when I get online, I am usually busy with downloading or answering
email, or researching something, or uploading web site updates,
 or downloading updates to something else. I just don't have much time for
online debates on other web sites, or Facebook, or anything like that.

<p>
I'll try to poke in there again, and see what is going on.
<p>
Perhaps other people would like to get in there and debate for me?
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Mister  T,
<p>
Thank you for all you do.  I suggest adding to your site the  &quot;AA definitions&quot;  of
words and phrases.  I understand you cannot speak for AA but you might say &quot;In my
opinion AA is saying....&quot;   The definitions may be dispersed in your site now and
you might give linkages the way you use &quot;here and here&quot; .  Things like: self will
run riot, surrender, amends, recovery, alcoholic, sponsor  etc.  I know this is easy
to say but difficult to do, as is most of your work.  Maybe you can start with a few
definitions and let it grow.  You may get more input than is reasonable.  Just a
thought.
<p>
Thank you again.<br>
Long Island Bob O.

Hi again, Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks.
That sounds like a great idea. It could also be done in both a straight and a humorous fashion,
sort of like Ambrose Bierce's <i>The Devil's Dictionary</i>.
<p>
I have
<a href="orange-definitions.html" target="_blank">a page of definitions of
some commonly-used A.A. words</a>,
but it gives the straight dictionary definitions of the words that A.A. tries to redefine
in &quot;<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#loaded_language" target="_blank">loaded language</a>&quot; twists.

<p>
But I'm probably not the best one to define the words. The people who really know all of the definitions
are the ex-members who spent 10 or 15 or 20 years in A.A. before quitting, and who
are hip to all of the &quot;other&quot; meanings of the words.
Anybody got any words and definitions to offer?
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I would like to ty  for your work &#8212; I think it prevented me from making a
big mistake &#8212; 

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Was on a website where people were posting on a thread re their problems
with alcohol &#8212; Myself I have had substance abuse  issues for a good 25
years  with a long 'dry' spell in between which fell apart after a break
up.  Anyway there was one person really pushing hard the AA and I sort of
thought well I tried stopping before and I am back to square one ( despite
numerous attempt over the last 9 years .. ) so why not &#8212; Luckily one of
the other posters posted a link to your website which I devoured over the
last few days and I am glad I did &#8212; I will walk a mile before going to the
AA as I got enough problems as it is ..

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

On a separate note &#8212; I wondered whether you have heard this before &#8212;  the
first time I stopped ( I was 22 ) I actually stopped by myself and I did
it by basically doing a mea culpa and asking god for help ( catholic
upbringing + feeling depressed  ) &#8212; I then spend the next 8 years until my
relationship fell apart keeping myself in check by telling my self &#8212; dude
you're a substance abuser for life so don't touch anything and basically
feeling miserable though out that  period ( I am sure that contributed to
that relationship falling apart as I was hiding in a shell throughout that
period )  . What I am trying to say is at that time I had no concept of
the 12 steps nor the AA &#8212; I was doing coke speed ecstasy etc (I was one of
those early 90's raver's ) and alcohol even though  consumed in large
quantities never was the central tenet of my addictive personality it only
be came that after I fell off the wagon 10 years ago . So I guess in a
weird way I sort of did my own steps and they look quite familiar to the
12- step program &#8212; Have you ever heard of other people experiencing this?

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Anyway I am now 10 days off the booze ( early days I know ) and am using
your inner monster page to keep check on myself without reverting mumbo
jumbo .. I have decided to try and  find why I am like I am and I believe
I might have a might form of Bipolar disorder which would explain a lot of
stuff that has happened in my life. Allthough am a bit reluctant to go see
my GP &#8212; don't like people probing me head )

So thanks again for all the effort you put in to this web page.

Hi Alex,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations on your new sobriety.
<p>
About finding yourself doing things similar to the 12 Steps: Yes, I can see that.
But the similarities are mostly just similarities in appearance;
 there are some big important differences.
 I am all for introspection, and recognizing that
you tend to have an &quot;addictive personality&quot; where you go non-linear when you get some intoxicants
into you, and just want more and more.  I have the same problem too, which is why I don't take
that stuff any more.
<p>
And I am all for any kind of sane meditation and self-awareness and self-examination.
That can actually be a very good thing.
And religious beliefs are okay too. And faith that the Creator of the Universe is basically loving
is just fine.
But A.A. twists it all around and perverts it, and makes it into a negative cult religion that does more
harm than good.
<p>
Likewise, you will often hear A.A. members claiming that the 12 Steps are &quot;based on the Bible&quot;, or
that they resemble something in the Bible. Same problem. The Bible most assuredly does not tell you
to do the 12 Steps and pray to &quot;anything as your Higher Power&quot;.
The Bible does not tell you that praying to a bedpan or a parakeet will save you from drugs and alcohol.

<p>
Since you are a Catholic, you will probably appreciate the web page on
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.
I covered a bunch of those issues there.
<p>
And I'm happy to hear that you are using the self-awareness technique on the web page about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">the Lizard Brain</a>
 to keep your base brain from fooling you into drinking.
That helped me a lot, back in my early years.
Basically, as long as you don't let old Lizard Brain talk you into believing
that &quot;just one&quot; will be okay, you can't lose.
So my favorite slogan is still,
<p>
