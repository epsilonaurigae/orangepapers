Subject:  	thanks<br>

<p>
I want to thank you for the 'Orange Papers'. AA at it's best is an
ecumenical religious organization which promotes abstinence for it's
members &#8212; nothing more. Everyone needs to be careful not to get
dogmatic, exaggerate or become rigid about the claims they make for it. I
don't believe for a minute AA is the only legitimate, or even the best
path, to sobriety.

<p>
While I continue to be a member and I recognize that there are many, many
well meaning members there are also a frightening number of deranged
sociopaths and assorted delusional's. They are, of course, attracted to
organizations which claim to offer help to the weak and vulnerable. I also
know there are, for the same reasons, equally deranged sociopaths active in
the 'treatment industry' as well.

<p>
I don't have an answer to either problem but do feel the warning you are
providing is invaluable. Keep it up.

Subject:  	your reply<br>

<p>
Dear Terrance Hodgins,
<p>
First of thank you for your reply and the extent you went to answer my questions.
It shows that you've had to defend your views a few times.  I am curious as to how
you feel about NA, because while I may not belong to AA, I do belong to NA.  I
myself can not stand AA, especially the old timers.  But for me NA has been a great
savior of my life.  Before NA I was headed for death.  Now I sense that you seem to
think of 12 steppers as sheep, that is probably just the ones you've encountered.  I
admit to the usage of God in our literature but I've also attended meetings of
atheists and agnostics in NA, where there was no reading of the literature due to
the word God in the literature.  But they also know that they have faced a power
greater than themselves, Drugs and Alcohol is a negative power greater than
themselves.
<p>
I know you think of us as a clone of AA, but we're not, all we are are a group of
people who meet together to help each other with our drug problems.  I understand
that there are some people out there with stronger wills than myself.  I LOVE DRUGS,
but like I said it was killing me.  The reason for writing that e-mail that way was
just a reaction of wow, this guy Hates AA, I want to know why??? Because I hate it
too...

<p>
I am curious about the other recovery groups you are a proponent of and what their
success rates are.  Because I know some people will not stay in NA, and my goal is
to make sure that they have an alternative to going back and using drugs, because
for those addicted to Heroin, Oxi's, Meth, or Crack Cocaine our bottoms are a
casket.  Our next hit might be our last hit.  And as a recovering addict I do not
wish Death on anyone, especially those that NA can not help.
<p>
Looking forward to your reply Terrance and may you stay clean another day,

<p>
Albert

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Albert,
<p>
Thanks for some reasonable questions.
<p>
<ol>
<li>

First off, I feel the same about Narcotics Anonymous as about Alcoholics Anonymous.
The differences between the two are hardly worth mentioning.
About the only differences that I saw were:
<p>
<ol start="A">
<li>  N.A. people think that N.A. is cooler and hipper than A.A., especially because A.A. is so stodgy
that you can only talk about alcohol there, while you can talk about drugs and alcohol at N.A.


<p><li> N.A. does not worship Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob the way that A.A. does.


<p><li> A.A. gives out coins for sober time, and N.A. gives out keytags. (By the way, I've still got mine,
including the glow-in-the-dark 1-Year tag.)

</ol>
<p>
Unfortunately, they both push an
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">old pro-Nazi cult religion</a>
as the cure for drug and alcohol problems, which is sheer insanity.
<p>
<li>
You said,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Before NA I was headed for death.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, what you mean is, &quot;Before I quit drugging, I was headed for death.&quot;

<p>
Yes, I had the same experience too. My doctor even said, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
I thought it over for a month, and then decided to live.

<p>
The thing that really matters is the decision to quit our addictions and improve our lifestyle.
That's the big one. That's everything. That's the whole ball game.
<p>
After that, it doesn't matter if you go to N.A. meetings, or go to church, or go to baseball games,
or go play tiddly-winks.
<p>
Assuming that Narcotics Anonymous is responsible for your clean and sober living is the logical
fallacy called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">confusing causation with correlation</a>.
Just because two things happen at the same time does not mean that one thing caused the other.
Like the rooster's crowing does not make the sun rise, even though, every morning, the two of
them do their dance together.
<p>
Lots of people decide not to die from drugs and alcohol, so they quit their bad habits, and also
go to some A.A. or N.A. meetings to see if that can help. Then some true believers work at convincing
them that the reason they quit their bad habits is because they are participating in a cult religion.
Not so.

<p>
<li>

I try hard to not stereotype A.A. and N.A. members. Remember that many of them were my friends and
acquaintances.  I only found about 10% of the members to be dogmatic, unrealistic, nutcases.
<p>
<li>

No, drugs and alcohol are not a &quot;negative power greater than ourselves.&quot;
In fact, the only power any drug has is the power to change your body chemistry a little bit and
give you a pleasant buzz.
It is you who desires the pleasant rush, and you who obtains the drug, and you who consumes it.
Left to themselves, drugs don't even have the power to get up off of the table and walk down
the street.

<p>
It's all us, and not the drug. We should not anthropomorphize drugs or alcohol.
Like
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">my child-molesting coke-snorting counselor</a>
 liked to say, &quot;Your addiction wants to kill you.&quot;
Wrong. There is no such monster as &quot;My Addiction&quot;, and it does not want to kill me.
There is only us and our desires.

<p><li>
About the &quot;meetings of atheists and agnostics in NA&quot;:
I really don't care whether people believe in God  &#8212;  I mean, I
<i>really</i> don't care  &#8212;   not unless they start chanting
<i>&quot;Gott Sei Mit Uns!&quot;</i> and praising Adolf Hitler...
<p>
x.A. having a few token atheists does not prove that x.A. is not a cult religion, not any more than
a corporation having a few token Negroes proves that it isn't racially biased.

<p><li>
RE:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I LOVE DRUGS, but like I said it was killing me.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, exactly. You understand. That is the most honest and realistic thing that you have said.
And that is the whole problem. Our desires. Not a &quot;negative power greater than ourselves&quot;.
Just our desires to feel good, to feel great, to trip on Cloud 9, to become totally ecstatic
and <i>Righteously Ripped</i> and feel absolutely grand.

<p>
Actually, to be nit-picking now, what we really love is the high. As soon as a drug stops getting
us high, we dump it and try a different one. We love the high, not the drug.
The drug is just a means to an end.

<p>
Have you seen the web page on
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>?
I talk about those desires there.

<p>
And you understand that using drugs leads to negative consequences. That's just the way that it is.
Everything has its cost. There is a good side and a bad side to using any drug or intoxicant.
Heck, there is even a good side and a bad side to eating chocolate cake.
Ask any morbidly obese person.

<p>
<li> About the success rates of other recovery groups and methods, the statistics are lacking.
There has been very little proper testing of any methods of recovery, even A.A.
Now that seems nuts, considering that we spend $20 billion per year on &quot;recovery&quot;, and it is
nuts to be spending so much on unproven methods. The treatments and methods
that are most used have never been shown to actually work.

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">The only proper study that I know of</a>
that compared A.A. and SMART found that the people who got A.A.
were doing <i>five times</i> as much binge drinking as an untreated group of alcoholics, and <i>nine
times</i> as much binge drinking as another group of alcoholics who got Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,
which is like SMART.
<p>
There has been some testing, and A.A. and N.A. failed every properly-conducted test.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
The one test that I recall that specifically included N.A.
was
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" target="_blank">a test of sponsorship</a>.
The results were that newcomers to N.A. getting sponsors did
not help them at all.

<p>
So how on Earth can I push those other methods and organizations
when they have not been clinically proven to work?
Because they don't teach cult religion nonsense and use
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">brainwashing techniques</a> and
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">drive people to suicide</a> 
or relapse.
We should at least not use methods that are very harmful, like a cult of confession.
Brainwashing techniques and cults of confession <i>have</i> been tested, and their results were disastrous.
Remember the source of the expression, &quot;drink the koolaid&quot;?

</ol>

<p>
I hope that you stay clean and sober too.
Not just &quot;for another day&quot;, but for life.
<br>
(That's another problem with the 12-Step doctrines: &quot;One day at a
time&quot; is a terrible way to live.  That's what got us into trouble
in the first place.
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Well, I survived getting high today. So far, so good.&quot;</i></font>)

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

Ok, as I've studied your site further,  I've come to see that you're the Fox News of
recovery.  You take and twist things the same way they do.  It is obvious that while
you have attended a few meetings you've never worked any of the steps.  So basically
what you've done is taken a stance against something that you've never. Even
attempted and try to convince others the evil of.  And as I read the letters of
those who support you, I can't help but think of the way Fox News viewers talk about
liberals.  Wow.  Oh by the way When you quoted Yoda: &quot; do or do not, there is no
try.&quot;   Maybe you should have gone with Obi-Wan's : &quot; only a Sith lord believes in
absolutes.&quot;
<p>
Good luck with your snake oil sales, maybe Fox News Viewers will buy it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Albert,
<p>
No, I do not twist things&quot;. I work very hard at making sure that every fact is correct, and
even documented and backed up by good evidence.
It is A.A. that twists things by using propaganda tricks like
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">lying with qualifiers</a>
by claiming that they have a great success rate with people who
&quot;really try&quot; and &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;.

You are correct when you guess that I have not done the 12 Steps. But
I don't need to, not any more than I need to drink some of Rev. Jim Jones'
koolaid to see how well that works, and how &quot;spiritual&quot; that
will make me. We can watch and see what such things do to other people.

<p>
Thanks for your reply. I honestly believe that your analysis of AA, as well
researched as it was, that the conclusions that you've drawn, are seriously flawed.
However, that is just my opinion. In my previous letter, I asked you &quot;what were the
major factors that motivated you to do such an in depth analysis?&quot; of AA. You have
not directly answered that question.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Al,
<p>
Yes I did. How many times do I have to say that I was sick unto death, and my doctor said,
&quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;?
I knew that I was dying. I got a good look into my grave, and decided to live.
</font>
<p>
Although you claim that you are neither agnostic nor atheist, I don't see you as a
believer in a Higher Power. Although your recovery might have been through self
reliance, that would not work for many.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't believe in Santa Claus. I don't expect a vague &quot;Higher Power&quot; ghost or spirit to grant my
wishes (if I grovel and pray and confess enough). People like the Jews in Auschwitz did a very
good job of thoroughly disproving that one long ago. But then again, I also don't believe in the
Nasty Nazi In The Sky who will kill you if you don't believe enough nonsense.
There is a lot more to spirituality than just begging a spirit to give
you things, or &quot;believing&quot; because Somebody Upstairs
will zap you with a thunderbolt if you don't.
</font>
<p>
I came to believe. From today's Daily Reflections:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, pg. 101

<p>
My spiritual growth is with God as I understand Him. With Him I find my true inner
self. Daily meditation and prayer strengthen and renew my source of well-being. I
receive then the openness to accept all that He has to offer. With God I have the
reassurance that my journey will be as He wants for me, and for that I am grateful
to have God in my life.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
What is the difference between &quot;spiritual growth&quot; and growth of gullibility and superstition?
<p>
Who says that God doesn't want you to be an alcoholic? After all,
&quot;He&quot; made you a born alcoholic, didn't &quot;He&quot;?

</font>
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous and the &quot;Big Book&quot; put God back into my life, and  saved my
life and countless others who have gone before. Your solution, or a lack
thereof would have killed me.

<p>
Peace......Al

<p>
<font color="blue">
If you really &quot;got God back in your life&quot;, then you must have
gained a new respect for the truth.
Like Jesus said, &quot;Learn the truth, and the truth will set you free.&quot;
<p>
So how can you participate in a cult religion that lies all of the time?
How can you sit still while lists of Bill Wilson's lies are read out loud
at the start of every A.A. meeting? (<i>Big Book</i> pages 58 through 60.)
That isn't very spiritual.
<p>
A.A. has not &quot;saved countless others who have gone before&quot;.
That is just standard A.A. propaganda. Bill Wilson started telling those grandiose lies
before the Big Book was even written. (Which means that Bill Wilson was really claiming
credit for the sobriety of people who were Oxford Group members.)
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
Lastly, you claim that you would have died if you had done things my way?
Getting honest and realistic and deciding not to die from addictions would
have killed you? Really? How does that work?

Dear OP. I have gone to your site more then once and LOVE it!! I was wondering if
you have ever considered making a version that can be put on a disk so we can cary it
with us, save it to our computers, etc. I know things are added on a reoutine bases
but whats up is great! I think the new information you added on the chips helps to
prove the point about how few get help in aa.

Hello James,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. And your wish was granted long ago. The whole web site was designed
so it can be run off of a CD.  The entire web site is contained in a set of archives files  &#8212; 
admittedly, a bunch of them now  &#8212;  how things grow. You just download the 59 archive files, and
put them into an empty subdirectory on your hard disk (&quot;Folder&quot; in Windoweze),
 and then unzip them all, and then burn
the contents of the whole subdirectory to a CD. It all fits on one CD, including the archive files
that you downloaded. The archive files are here:
<p>
<a href="menu1.html#archives" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/menu1.html#archives</a>
<p>
and another copy of the instructions is here:
<p>
<a href="orange-letters29.html#make_CD" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters29.html#make_CD</a>
<p>
After burning the CD, you can start browsing by viewing the file
&quot;menu1.html&quot; or &quot;index.html&quot;. (They are the same thing.)

<p>
Notice that the archive files are designed so that you don't have to download
everything every time that you want to update your copy of the web site.
Most often, only the &quot;alpha&quot; file changes  &#8212;  that is the
text of the web pages, and any new images are added at the end of the
list of image files, so that you usually only need to download the last
&quot;img&quot; file, or maybe two at most.
That really cuts down on the labor of updating your local copy.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello,

I have been reading the information regarding AA on your web site.  It is
very compelling and I am interested in reading more.  My own experience has
shown me that this program of &quot;recovery&quot; is not effective long term and a
lot of what you have written is very similar to what I have seen.  I would
like to know more about the writer of this information, nothing really
personal, but just some information that will help me with credibility and
motivation for writing the material.  Thanks.

<p>

A woman was in stable condition Friday after being shot in the head by a
man fighting with her husband at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in
Baldwin Park, police said.

<p>
The woman, whose name was not released, was sitting in a car outside First
Presbyterian Church of Baldwin Park on Stewart Avenue about 7:30 p.m. Thursday,
according to a police report.

<p>
A fistfight erupted between her husband and another man at the
meeting, which rents space from the church but is not connected to it,
church officials said. The fight then spilled out into the parking lot.

<p>
One of the men pulled a handgun and fired at the other. The bullet
missed the intended victim and hit the woman, according to the report.
Her car careened across busy Los Angeles Street and hit a fence,
according to the report. It was unclear how her car went into drive as
she was sitting in it, and police did not say if she was in the driver's seat or the
passenger's side of the car.
The shooter ran off, and there was no detailed description of him.

<p>
The San Gabriel Valley Tribune quotes police as saying the woman's husband was the
intended victim.
Police did not know the reason for the fight inside the meeting.

 That quote really is priceless. I never cease to be amazed and appalled
at the ability of the human race to rationalize and make excuses and evade the obvious truth, and
deny any responsibility for the results of bad behavior.

<p>
Bill Wilson liked to rave about how bad alcoholics are:
<blockquote>

<p>
But the truth is, it isn't just alcoholics. Lots of people are guilty of that.
Alcoholics have no monopoly on sin or stupidity.
<p>

This line is also both ignorant and obtuse:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

for corporal punishment. &quot;To give up the use of the rod is to give
up our views of human nature, God, eternity,&quot; they write in the book.<br>
</font>

<p>
Well, actually, the same section of the Bible also advocates robbing and murdering your non-Jewish neighbors
and raping their virgin daughters:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Moses became angry with the army commanders and said,
&quot;I can't believe you let the women live! They are the ones
who followed Balaam's advice and invited our people to worship
the god Baal-Peor. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; You must put to death every boy and
all of the women who have ever had sex. But do not kill the
young women who have never had sex.  You may keep them for
yourselves. &nbsp; ...<br>
Moses and Eleazar followed the LORD's instructions, and
listed everything that had been taken from the Midianites.
The list included &nbsp; ... &nbsp; 32,000 young women who had never had sex.<br>
</font>
Numbers 31:14-35
</blockquote>

<font color="blue">
This book of Moses says that Moses' army kept 32,000 young virgins for their sex toys,
so they must have slaughtered
a couple of hundred thousand other people &#8212; the older women,
younger girls, men, boys, and infants.
If Moses were alive today, he would be taken to the Hague and put on
trial for war crimes, right beside Slobodan Milosevik.
<i>&quot;Genocide&quot;</i> is the only name for such racist immoral conduct.
But hey! Moses' scribblings in the Bible say that it is not only okay, but is the holy way to live.

<p>
That is a good description of genocide. Same thing as Hitler tried to do to the Jews later on.


<p>
Personally, I don't use that part of the Bible as a guide for anything.
<p>
By the way, the Pearls who advocate beating children according to Biblical instructions are not Jewish, are they?
They promote Christianity. They worship &quot;other gods&quot; like Jesus Christ, whom Moses would have 
called a false prophet.  So those Christians must be put to death with the sharp edge of the sword, too, and
their entire town burned to the ground. The Bible says so.

One paragraph really stands out for me:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
My view on such matters hasn't changed much over the years: if allowing
someone (child, partner, friend) in your life, and spending your resources
on that person, is destroying your life, then maybe you should cut someone off &#8212;
whether that's a complete cut-off, or only partial, would be your decision.
Best, though, not to presume about what effect you will have on the person in question.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consider that the cutting off works both ways. I was the victim of
&quot;tough love&quot; at the hands of an alcoholic military sergeant
father who forced me into the military during the Vietnam War after I
started taking LSD and smoking marijuana.
I have not talked to my mother in 25 years, or my father in 30 years.
I believe that he is dead &#8212; that he went back to Mexico and drank
himself to death while living like a king on his military retirement checks.
<p>
If parents want that kind of a relationship with their children,
go ahead with the &quot;tough love&quot; routine.

Dear Orange,

<p>
I'm absolutely amazed by your website. It contains such a wealth of
information, which I hope the health care and recovery communities will

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sarah,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
</font>
<p>
As a doctoral candidate in theology and former participant in twelve-step
groups, I am particularly interested in what you have to say about twelve
step programs and religion. I agree with you completely: this approach to
spirituality is heretical from the standpoint of Christianity and also many
other major religions. I do not understand why most churches are so willing
to allow these groups to meet on their property.
<p>
 One thing I didn't notice
in your writing which I think would be interesting to address is the
presence of Calvinistic thought in both Buchman's Oxford Group and Bill
Wilson's AA. I bring this up because as a theologian, I see strong
overtones of Calvinism in twelve step literature, which should be
problematic to both Catholic Christians and Protestants in the Armenian
tradition (including Methodists and some Baptists) who participate in AA. I
doubt that many non-Calvinist Christians even recognize that practice of
the twelve steps necessitates admitting that humanity is depraved and free
will is an impediment rather than a gift: totally contrary to doctrine. And
as you've already mentioned, all Christians, regardless of denomination,
would be opposed to the anything-goes God. I think it's important that
people be made aware of this issue, and I would love to write about it
myself at some point in my career. If this is a topic you would ever be
interested in discussing on your site, I would be glad to share my thoughts
and possible sources of information.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yes, I'm aware of the Calvinist elements in their philosophy. I described that
<a href="orange-heresy.html#inherited_sin" target="_blank">in that <i>Heresy</i> file, here</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This effectively makes Alcoholics Anonymous one of the strangest
deviant sects of Calvinism around: They believe in predestination
with a nasty genetic twist.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And I wouldn't mind discussing it some more.
<p>
And the idea that
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#no_self_reliance" target="_blank">free will and self-reliance are detriments</a>
is such an insidious idea, isn't it? By their faulty logic,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">selling your soul to the Devil in trade for sobriety</a>
is a perfectly valid solution to the problem of alcohol addiction.
You turn control of your will and your thinking and your life over to a &quot;Higher Power&quot; with scaly skin and
cloven hooves, and He tells you what to do and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#freedom2think" target="_blank">what to think</a>,
for the rest of your life, and all of Eternity thereafter.

<p>
I agree with you about the &quot;anything-goes god&quot;. We have occasionally talked about the rationalization
that anything, including robbery and statutory rape, is okay because &quot;We are not saints.&quot;
<a href="orange-letters271.html#not_saints" target="_blank">Like here</a>.

</font>
<p>
<a name="Calix"> </a>
One other thing I think may be important to clarify. On
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">your &quot;Snake Oil&quot;page</a>
(which, by the way, is spot on!) you list Calix as &quot;a Catholic
12-step-based recovery organization.&quot; While one could definitely classify
it this way, I hope that as a person who is now completely opposed to the
twelve steps but still participates in Calix, I can provide a bit of
additional information. The vast majority of Calix members belong to a
twelve-step fellowship of some kind, but Calix itself does not push the
steps like AA and similar organizations do. Calix activities mostly include
recovery-themed talks on the Catholic faith, Eucharistic adoration, and
Mass. The organization views itself as a spiritual supplement to the steps.
I'm not a big fan of the fact that Calix's official position is that twelve
step is the best way to recover from addiction, but as a Catholic I am glad
that this organization exists to encourage Catholics to integrate the
richness of the Church's tradition into the recovery process. In a way, I
wonder if an unsaid, unwritten reason for Calix's existence is the obvious
fact that the twelve-step God is incompatible with Catholicism. Even after
leaving traditional twelve-step groups, I choose to continue my
participation in Calix because it provides a specialized form of pastoral
care for recovering and recovered individuals. I know lots of other Calix
members who feel the same way about the steps and Bill Wilson as I do, and
they have no problem participating in Calix. Sometimes, the priest will
discuss something from the steps as part of a homily (and when he does, I
simply ignore it), but for the most part, no one really cares whether or
not a Calix member is actively attending twelve-step meetings. Because of
this, I'm not sure I would place Calix in the same category as the other
twelve-step groups you list. But not offense intended &#8212; this is just a
suggestion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No offense taken. Thanks for the clarification of what Calix is about.
</font>
<p>
Thank you again for all the effort you have put into this site. I look
forward to reading more.

Subject:  	RE: I need your help<br>

<p>
Terrance,
<p>
I would be so grateful to you if you could post a request for addiction treatment
(12 step based) horror stories.  Please have them respond to you and then just
forward them to me. And if you have some great horror stories and e-mail addresses
you can get to me now, that would be great.

<p>

So in your request for horror stories, just tell them someone is doing real &amp;
honest research and needs real stories about how treatment centers treat addiction.
(97% of the treatment centers in the US are 12 step based, yet 12 step has never
been studied)

<p>
The two subject families I would really like to talk to, would have these types of
scenarios;
<ul>
<li> 1 &#8212; A family that spent all their money (retirement savings or
re-mortgaged the house) on addiction treatment for their 'loved one' and the loved one is
still using.
<li> 2 &#8212; A family that spent all their money on treatment centers for their
'loved one' and he or she died anyway.
</ul>

<p>
I think its bad enough that AA says they are the best 'treatment' for addiction,
with zero credible data support that claim, but at least it's free.  But when a so
called, non-profit treatment center (like Betty Ford) charges a $1,000 a day, and
all they do is essentially teach AA, I think it's malpractice.
<p>

Sincerely,
<p>
Anon.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Anon,
<p>
Yes, I'll be happy to post some notices to get some stories.

<p>
And I think it's malpractice too.  And even that is the subject of double-talk.
The 12-Step salesmen alternate between saying that A.A. is not treatment (so it can't be medical
malpractice, and they don't have to produce success statistics), and then it
suddenly is supposedly very good treatment for &quot;alcoholism&quot;.

<p>
In fact, that is the subject of one of the items in the file of A.A. bait-and-switch tricks:
<p>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#not_treatment" target="_blank">First, A.A. is good treatment for the
&quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;, and then it isn't treatment at all.</a>
<p>
So, readers, if you have any A.A. horror stories to contribute to the cause, this guy is a journalist
who is collecting information and evidence.
He wants to remain anonymous while he does his research, so please send the stories to me and I'll forward them.
<p>
Thanks, all, and have a good day.

Hi Orange,

<p>
Here are some more documents for you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, iamnotastatistic,
<p>
Ah, yes, documents. I love documents.

</font>
<p>
The first is the meeting minutes from an AA area meeting this year. On page
three you can read the following regarding the Treatment Committee report:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
TREATMENT: ... The Committee has received a few complaints, from various
Treatment Facilities. The panels going in for the Bridging the Gap Program
have been giving advice to patients, in contradiction with what their
attending physician has recommended. These problems were addressed and the
coordinators for the facility were contacted and advised of the situation.
The Committee decided to send a letter to all facilities participating in
the Bridging the Gap Program stating that if problems arise, to contact the
Corrections Committee.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
The Bridging the Gap program involves established members starting,
coordinating, moderating, etc., AA meetings in treatment facilities. In
general these meetings are closed to anyone but Bridging the Gap program
members and patients. The oldtimers involved in these meetings have a
captive audience and apparently that kind of power goes to their heads.
They are going into treatment facilities and telling patients not to take
their doctor-prescribed medications. How are these patients supposed to
recover when saboteurs like AA are given access to them that is denied to
either family members or other community based support groups? Also, I love
the corrective action plan: If it happens again  &#8212;  call a different
committee to complain.

<p>
I wonder if this issue will be discussed at the General Service Conference
this year? I wonder if G.S.O. will issue a press release to warn all
alcoholics and the general public that this is happening in A.A?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Fat chance.
</font>
<p>
The second document is from the South East Michigan Community Alliance
which coordinates and administers treatment for substances abuse disorders
in that area  &#8212;  generally to low or no-income patients. It states that the
Code of Federal Regulations, 45CFR, part 96, gives every patient the right
to receive alternative, non-faith-based, treatment services. All the
patient has to do is object to the religious nature of 12-Step treatment
and it cannot be forced upon them. It's very simple  &#8212;  if you know that you
have the right to object and have the guts to do it.

<p>
This is all possible because the treatment facilities and all the
organizations involved in administering the treatment receive federal
funding (plus state and local govt. funding). This made me think of another
application: Drug Courts! All drug courts receive federal funding. Is it
possible that anyone who is sentenced to AA can simply go to their judge or
probation officer and use CFR 45, part 96, to object to being sentenced to
AA? If an alternative, non faith based, solution is not provided then could
that drug court lose its federal funding? Would the local courts be willing
to risk their income in order to support AA?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Those are very good questions. I think I'll have to mention that to my newly-elected Congresswoman,
Susan Bonamici.
(Oops! She hasn't been elected yet. She only won the primary.)
Oh heck, that's even better. Politicians' ears work especially
well just before elections.

<p>
Thanks Orange
