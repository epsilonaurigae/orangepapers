<font size="+2">
<b>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.</b>
</font>
<p>
Right here, right at the start, is a giant problem. I am
not powerless over alcohol, not even
close. I have almost perfect control over alcohol.  I can drink
it or not, I can let it sit on the table
and look at it, and I might even be able to juggle it. I can also
drink enough to kill myself. My choice.
<p>
The second half of that sentence says that
my life is &quot;unmanageable&quot;. Ummm, no, that isn't quite
right. If I drink alcohol, my life becomes
a disorganized mess &#8212; I drink too much alcohol, and I get
more or less addicted to it, and
I get very sick and can't work, and
I get behind on the rent, and the utility
companies turn everything off, and I starve, but I
still wouldn't say that my life was &quot;unmanageable&quot;
because I was &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<p>
Step One might be halfways true if it said that us alcoholics couldn't
manage our lives very well while drinking alcohol. And Step One might
be true if it said that it was ultimately impossible for us to continue
drinking alcohol and still have a happy life. But that isn't what Step
One says.
<p>
Bill Wilson's statement that alcoholics are powerless over alcohol was
just his translation of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman's strange Oxford Group
religious doctrine that
we have all been &quot;defeated by sin&quot; and are powerless over it
(so the only remedy is to
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender" target="_blank">surrender ourselves to
God-control</a>&quot; and have God &quot;guide&quot; us like so many little puppets).

<p>
Bill Wilson wrote that alcoholics are so powerless over alcohol that they simply
can't help but take a drink and go on a binge now and then, so only
A.A. and its &quot;Higher Power&quot; can save the alcoholic from
Demon Rum. In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill had one alcoholic saying this after a binge:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I now remembered what my alcoholic
friends [Bill Wilson and Doctor Robert Smith]
had told me, how they had prophesied that if I had an alcoholic
mind, the time and place would come &#8212; I would drink again. They had
said that though I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before
some trivial reason for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and
more, for what I had learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I
knew from that moment that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will
power and self-knowledge would not help in those strange mental blank
spots. I had never been able to understand people who said that a
problem had them hopelessly defeated. I knew then. It was a crushing
blow.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 3, More About
Alcoholism, pages 41-42.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Bill Wilson drove the point home:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental
defense against the first drink. Except in a few rare cases, neither he nor
any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must
come from a Higher Power.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 3, More About
Alcoholism, page 43.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you are just helpless &#8212; powerless &#8212; when it comes to quitting drinking by yourself.
You just can't resist the temptation of that first drink.
<p>
What a setup: &quot;You are powerless over alcohol, and you are doomed to die unless 
A.A. saves you. So join my cult.&quot;
<p>
Bill instructed the A.A. recruiters to say this to the new prospects:
<p>
<a name="join_quick"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If he sticks to the idea that he can
still control his drinking, tell him that possibly he can &#8212; if he is
not too alcoholic. But insist that if he is severely afflicted,
there may be little chance he can recover by himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Continue to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a
fatal malady. Talk about the conditions of body and mind which
accompany it. Keep his attention focussed mainly on your
personal experience. Explain that many are doomed who never
realize their predicament.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson, page 92.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson's dogma is contradictory. He declared that alcoholics
cause their own problems &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-recruit.html#our_making" target="_blank">After all, our problems were
of our own making. Bottles were only a symbol</a>&quot; &#8212;
and then Bill declared that alcoholics were powerless to save themselves &#8212; that they
couldn't change their own behavior and recover by their own efforts, not even to
save their own lives.
<ul>
<li>
So you are very powerful and in control of your life and responsible for your actions
when it comes to drinking and creating your own problems (so you should feel guilty and do a Fifth Step and confess
all of your sins),
<li>
But you are &quot;powerless&quot; and unable to control your behavior
when it comes to <i>not</i> drinking and <i>not</i> creating problems for yourself.
</ul>
<p>
That is nonsense.
<p>
<a href="orange-heresy.html#powerless" target="_blank">It is also heretical</a>.
If we humans have free will and can choose good or evil for ourselves,
then we cannot also be powerless and unable to control our actions.

ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.<br>

<p>
When you think about it, you realize that the implications are huge.  Instead of being helpless powerless
victims of circumstances, moved around the world like a leaf in a windstorm, we are powerful people who can
make our own decisions and improve our own lives by our own efforts.

My doctor said it this way,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Alcoholics have great control over their sobriety. They
can stay sober for years at a time. They just don't have any
control over their drinking. Their drinking will spin out of control
very rapidly.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That answered a lot of questions for me, because I
had always had a problem with the A.A. &quot;powerless over
alcohol&quot; confession. I'm not powerless &#8212; I can stay sober
for years at a time, and have done so before, and am doing it again.
I only have a problem with alcohol when it is inside of me.
Then I go non-linear and try to drink myself into the astral plane.

<p>
The doctrine that you are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; is really
bad, and has killed a lot of people.
It is a formula for disaster that often becomes a self-fulfilling prediction.
When people really believe that
they cannot control their own drinking because they are powerless over alcohol,
then they don't. They tend to go on prolonged binges,
imagining that they have no choice in the matter.
(Well, stupid as it is, it sounds good when you are drunk.)
The idea that you are powerless over alcohol and can't help yourself is
an alcoholic's ready-made rationalization for taking a drink whenever the urge
comes along.
In one controlled study of A.A.'s effectiveness,
court-mandated offenders who had been sent to A.A. for several months
were doing
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank"><b>five times
as much binge drinking</b></a> as the other alcoholics who got
no such Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;help&quot;.

<p>
For a while, I did believe that I was powerless over alcohol, and
powerless over tobacco, too. I had quit and backslid so many times that I thought,
<font color="blue">
&quot;What's the point in trying to quit again? You'll just start again.
Might as well just stay stoned until the bitter end comes.&quot;
</font>
I didn't get my health back and my life together until I came to believe that I was
not powerless over alcohol or tobacco &#8212; that I really could quit, and stay quit, and then
I did just that.

The doctrine that you are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; is also a

&quot;Honey, it isn't my fault that I got drunk last night and went on a huge binge
and threw a screaming drunken temper tantrum and tore up the house.
Dr. Silkworth says that I have a disease, and I'm powerless over alcohol, so I can't
help it.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson actually did exactly that &#8212; threw
a big drunken screaming temper tantrum and kicked out the door panels
of his wife Lois' house, and threw a sewing machine at
her.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
Lois Wilson screamed at him and called him &quot;a drunken sot&quot;,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Bills_AlAnon" target="_blank">an act of disrespect
for which the vain, narcissistic Bill Wilson never forgave Lois</a>.
<p>
<a href="orange-powerless.html#Silkworths_theory" target="_blank">When Dr. Silkworth
talked about alcoholism as an allergy</a>,
and alcoholics being
powerless over alcohol, Bill immediately seized on the idea as
a convenient excuse to explain away all of his previous bad behavior.
And Dr. Silkworth's
idea also fit neatly with Frank Buchman's religious doctrine that everybody was
&quot;defeated by sin&quot; and &quot;insane&quot;, and that only God
could &quot;restore one to sanity&quot;.

<p>
Step One is a setup for surrender to the cult. Since you are
powerless over alcohol, you will need somebody or something else
(like a sponsor) to be your keeper, and take care of you, and
tell you what to do, to keep you from drinking.
This step encourages dependence on the cult instead of self-reliance;
incompetence and failure instead of competence and success.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer considered inducing a sense of powerlessness
and guilt to be one of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">the five essential conditions</a>
for an effective mind-control, or &quot;brainwashing&quot;, program.
This step, and the next two, where you confess
that you are insane, and then surrender to &quot;<i>Something</i> greater
than yourself&quot;, do a fine job of inducing a sense of powerlessness.
And then the following steps, Steps Four through Ten, induce plenty of guilt.

<b>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b>
</font>
<p>
I'm not insane, so I don't need to be restored to sanity. 
Besides, I know enough about
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Buchmanism</a> to know
what this line is really saying. Frank Buchman and his cult believed
that everyone in the world was &quot;defeated by sin&quot;, and was
&quot;insane&quot;, except for Frank and his boys, of
course. The only way to regain sanity, Frank said, was to
&quot;surrender yourself to God-control&quot;,
which really meant &quot;surrender yourself to Frank-control.&quot; No thanks.
<p>
A.A. claims that the current meaning of this line is just that
you can believe in
<i>anything</i>, including a doorknob or a potato, a mountain or a
motorcycle, a bedpan or a
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#bedpan" target="_blank">Group Of Drunks</a>&quot; (G.O.D.)
as your Higher Power, and it will somehow &quot;restore you to sanity&quot;.
Interesting.  Then how do we do the next step?
How can I turn over my will and my life to the care
of a bedpan or a potato or a doorknob? And, for that matter, in this Step,
how is a bedpan going to restore me to sanity?
<p>
Again, this step encourages dependence and powerlessness. The implication of
this step is that you cannot heal yourself &#8212; you are so insane that only
some <i>Higher Power</i> can fix your mind and restore you to sanity.
Logically then, there is little reason for you to even try to fix yourself.
Just wait for old <i>H.P.</i> to do it for you.

<p>
And there is another funny angle to this step: If you really are insane,
then it doesn't matter what you <i><b>believe</b></i> will restore you to
sanity. You are insane. Your beliefs are crazy and irrelevant.<br>
<ul>
<li> You might <b><i>come to believe</i></b> that licking truck transmissions
filled with orange juice will restore you to sanity. Will it?
<li> You might <b><i>come to believe</i></b> that slavish participation
in a fascist cult religion will restore you to sanity. Will it?
</ul>

<p>
And finally, in this step, Bill Wilson also cleverly used the propaganda trick of
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;</i>.
This step actually says that they
<i>came to believe</i> that a &quot;Higher Power&quot; <b><i>could</i></b> restore them to
sanity. This step does not say that any 'Higher Power' <b><i>actually will</i></b> heal
the A.A. members, just that they believe that He <b><i>could</i></b> do it, if he felt like it.
What if 'Higher Power' says,<br>
<font color="#550000">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Well yeh, sure, I CAN restore you to sanity, but I get so many laughs, watching
you all act like a bunch of crazy hairless monkeys, that I think I'll leave you just the way
that you are now.
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Besides, I went to all of the trouble of making you born alcoholics in the first place;
why should I change that now?&quot;

<font size="+2">
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</font>
<p>
And here it is. This is where you surrender your will and
your mind to
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#obey_Buchman" target="_blank">Frank-control</a>.
But since Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman
and his convert, William Griffith Wilson, are both dead, you will
have to surrender your will and
your life to Alcoholics Anonymous and your sponsor. Bill Wilson even
wrote, many times, in the <i>Big Book</i>
and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> that you could
<!-- a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#group_power" -->
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_group" target="_blank">use A.A. itself as your
Higher Power</a>
if you had troubles with using a supernatural &quot;God&quot; as your
Higher Power.
(<i>&quot;G.O.D.&quot; = &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;</i>)
That is
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender" target="_blank"><i><b>surrender to the
cult</b></i></a>, pure and simple.
<p>
Some A.A. true believers may complain that I am completely distorting and
misinterpreting this. I don't think so. The author of the 12 Steps,
Bill Wilson, pulled a bait-and-switch stunt here.
In Step 2, I only had to
believe in a nice, vague, &quot;Power greater than myself.&quot; 
But it somehow just became &quot;God as we understood Him&quot; with
all of the emotional associations of the word &quot;God.&quot;
What happened to the nice, vague, warm and fuzzy
&quot;Power&quot; of doorknobs and potatoes?
<p>
And this new &quot;God&quot; not only has to be someone who can take
care of my will and my life for
me, but He has to be Someone stupid enough to waste His time
doing so... Potatoes and doorknobs don't qualify.

<p>
Then, my sponsor and the other old-timers at the meetings will
gradually
<a href="orange-recruit.html#redefineGod" target="_blank">redefine &quot;God
as I understand Him&quot;</a>,
until I believe the same things as everybody else in the group.
&quot;God as I understand It&quot; will gradually become
&quot;God as we understood Him&quot;.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education" target="_blank">Bait and switch</a>.

<p>
And what they actually believe is that God is a vicious
Old-Testament-style tyrant
who will torture you to death with alcohol if you don't
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">believe in Him</a> and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#daily_vision" target="_blank">Seek and Do

care of our wills and our lives for us in Step Three,
and He won't be removing all of our defects in Step 7, and the 12 Steps won't work.
<p>
In fact, the 12 Steps say that God must do a lot of things for us:
<ul>
<li> Step 1: God must manage our unmanageable lives for us.
<li> Step 2: God must restore us to sanity.
<li> Step 3: God must take care of our wills and our lives for us.
<li> Step 5: God must listen to our confessions.
<li> Step 7: God must remove all of our defects of character, and moral shortcomings, and wrongs.
<li> Step 11: God must talk to us in a s&eacute;ance and give us work orders and the power to carry them out.
<li> Step 12: God must give us a
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">&quot;spiritual experience&quot;,
or a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;</a>.
</ul>

<p>
An A.A. God who does not dictate orders and who does not interfere with
events in this world and pull puppet strings in order to make A.A. members
happy is out of the question, because the Twelve Steps simply cannot
work without God making them work.

Just as a funny side note, the true believers don't seem to
notice what comes next:
Logically, there is no point in printing Steps 4 through 12,
because you don't have any will of
your own any more, not after Step 3, so you can't work the rest
of the steps. God is in control
now, and He may have you doing anything He wishes: washing dishes
in an orphanage, or going
to Disneyland, or helping a farmer in Kansas with his harvest, or
just anything. You won't do
Steps 4 through 12 unless God wants you to, and there is little
point in you doing them after God
has taken over. Those steps mostly deal with things like listing
all of your bad points, and
confessing them to God. God already knows all of that garbage,
so there is no point in wasting
your time doing that, not when you could be doing something
useful, like volunteering at a
charity. So don't print Steps 4 through 12. If God really wants
you to do them, He will tell you
what they are when you need to hear it. So did we just reduce A.A.
to a three-step program, or what?

Dr. Arthur Deikman describes surrender to a cult this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Surrender is a basic feature of the spiritual life. As an acceptance of selfless goals
in place of self-centeredness, it is something most recognize as inherently desirable.
Yet the call to surrender can become a tool for manipulation and control when critical
judgement is set aside. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
...total surrender is called for by fundamentalist preachers and organizations such
as the Campus Crusade. Bill Bright, writing in <i>Jesus and the Intellectual</i>
makes it quite explicit: &quot;The secret is surrender. Commitment to Christ involves
the surrender of the intellect, the emotions and the will &#8212; the total
person.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>26</sup></font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is no place in such groups for reasoned, independent judgement; no free will,
no responsible choice, only literal adherence to sacred text as selected and
interpreted by the church leader or organization. With surrender, the authority of
the church is maximized, the follower feels relieved of uncertainty and choice
and can then experience the &quot;bliss&quot; of someone who has &quot;returned
home.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>
<p>

So, does Bill Wilson demand total surrender of our minds and our wills to his cult?
Yes. Absolutely yes. The word &quot;will&quot; is in Step Three, and then Bill repeatedly
demanded that we
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">give up our human intelligence,
reason, and logic</a>, and just
&quot;have faith&quot; in his religious proclamations:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe
that our human intelligence was the last word... Rather vain of us,
wasn't it?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,
even against organized religion. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>We Agnostics</i>, page 49.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then Wilson wrote that we will have to abandon &quot;Reason&quot; in
order to reach his &quot;New Land of faith&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge
of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason
had brought us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and
did not like to lose our support.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Page 53.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<!-- ----------------

And we need to be beaten into submission if we won't accept Bill Wilson's
religion on faith alone:
<P>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Besides a seeming inability to accept much on
faith, we found ourselves handicapped by obstinacy,
sensitiveness, and unreasoning prejudice. Many of us
have been so touchy that even casual reference to
spiritual things made us bristle with antagonism. This
sort of thinking had to be abandoned. Though some of
us resisted, we found no great difficulty in casting aside
such feelings. Faced with alcoholic destruction, we
soon became as open minded on spiritual matters as
we tried to be on other questions. In this respect
alcohol was a great persuader. It finally beat us into a
state of reasonableness. Sometimes this was a tedious
process; we hope no one else will be prejudiced for as
long as some of us were.<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Why all this insistence that every A.A. member must hit bottom first?
The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the A.A.
program unless they have hit bottom. For practicing A.A.'s remaining
eleven Steps means the adoption of attitudes and actions that almost
no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking. Who wishes to
be rigorously honest and tolerant? &nbsp; ...<br>
Under the lash of alcoholism, we are driven to A.A. ... <br>

Then Wilson wrote that having faith in his proclamations was more logical
than logic itself:

Logic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not by
chance we were given the power to reason, to examine the evidence
of our senses, and to draw conclusions. That is one of man's
magnificent attributes. We agnostically inclined would not feel
satisfied with a proposal which does not lend itself to reasonable
approach and interpretation. Hence we are at pains to tell why
we think our present faith is reasonable, why we think it more
sane and logical to believe, why we say our former thinking was
soft and mushy when we threw up our hands in doubt and said,
&quot;We don't know.&quot;<br></font>

<p>
Bill Wilson's &quot;Third Step Prayer&quot; is an outrageous piece of
grovelling masochistic infantile narcissism that demands that you surrender to
Bill's authoritarian version of God:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our
Maker, <i>as we understood Him</i>: &quot;God, I offer myself to
Thee &#8212; to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy
will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may
bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love,
and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!&quot; We thought
well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that
we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson, page 63.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Abandon ourselves utterly&quot;?</i>
</font>

<p><br>
The part of Step Three that I find the funniest is that fact that
Bill Wilson couldn't write coherent
English, so it seems like all we have to do here is &quot;make a
decision&quot; to do something:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God
<i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</font>
<p>
It seems like we don't actually ever have to get
around to doing anything else. Down below, in Steps 6 and 7,
Bill belabors another point like
this, taking one step to think about doing something, and the next step to
actually do it, but this time, we never really do
it, we just think about it.
We just &quot;make a decision&quot; to do something, maybe later...
<p>
Okay, I'll think about it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
(And what I thought was, it
sounds like a stupid way to try to
avoid all of my problems, and shove them all on Somebody Else,
and it won't work. And there is no way I'm
going to surrender my will and
my mind to the care of Alcoholics Anonymous and a sponsor who
confesses that he is powerless
over alcohol, that his life is unmanageable, that he is
insane, and that he can't ever be cured...
Why would I want a loser like that running my life?)
</font>

<p><br>
There is actually a great deal of presumptuousness in this
step. That is, the member presumes to be able to give his will
away, ostensibly to some Higher Power.
As if he really had that much control over his own mind and his will.
If your will is your collected wishes and desires, then
you have to have control over them to be able to give them away, 
or stop them, or do any such thing with them.
Is it even possible to really give away all of your desires?
Does that include giving away the desire to give away your desires?
<p>

How many Americans actually have any experience with
really controlling their own wills or their own minds or their desires?
This gets to sounding a lot like Buddhism, which practices
controlling one's own mind and
reducing one's desires in order to increase personal happiness
by having fewer unfulfilled desires.
But that is easier said than done.
I can just hear the old master on <i>Kung Fu</i> saying,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Ah yes, little Grasshopper. If you have no desires,
where does the desire to control your desires come from?
How could you control your desires if you have no more
desires left &#8212; not even the desire to control your desires?
But if you do desire to control your desires, then you haven't
gotten rid of all of your desires, now have you?&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Indeed. If you give your will to a Higher Power, how could you
have the will to continue to control your will?
And if you don't have the will to control your will,
and can't control your own will any longer, then how
could you continue to place your will in the care of your Higher
Power?
What's to stop you from accidentally &quot;taking your will back&quot;
without meaning to do so?

<p>
What nonsense. All of that &quot;turning your will over to a
Higher Power&quot; and &quot;surrender&quot; talk is really just a bunch of double-talk.
The only thing &quot;turning your will over&quot; can really
mean is,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Okay, I give up. I surrender. I'll be your obedient slave and do
what you say.&quot;
</font>

<p><br>
Oh, and there is one more giant gotcha that no one will talk
about: What if you surrender yourself to the Will of God, and it
turns out that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i><b>It is God's Will that you drink yourself to death</b></i></font>? 
<p>
It can't be? Says who?
<p>
I mean, it was God's Will that you inherited the gene for
alcoholism.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#inherited_sin" target="_blank">You were a born alcoholic</a>, weren't you?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...it wasn't because my wife left me that I started to drink,
or because my mother didn't love me. It was because I have always been
a potential alcoholic.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Delirium Tremens, Stories of Suffering and Transcendence</i>,
Ignacio Solares, Hazelden, 2000, page 29.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Then it seems to have been God's Will that you drank
for all of those years before A.A..<br>
No? That wasn't doing God's Will?<br>
Then why did God make you an alcoholic in the first place?<br>
Why did God stick you with the gene for alcoholism, instead of a
harmless gene, if He didn't want you to drink like a fish, and
even expect you to drink, and know full well that you were going to
drink too much?<br>
<p>
Then, why did God let you drink so much for so long?<br>
Or make you drink so much for so long?<br>
Was God just using you as an object lesson for other alcoholics?
<p>
<font color="blue">
But then, suddenly, the instant that you walk into an A.A. meeting room, God
abruptly changes his mind about everything and decides that
it is now His Will that you not drink any more alcohol. Huh?

Just as a funny side note, one possible answer to that question is
&quot;Jem-Hadar and Ketracel-white&quot;.
<p>
Remember the <i>Star Trek Deep Space Nine</i> series where the Founders,
the Changelings, addicted their warrior slaves to a drug-like substance
called &quot;White&quot; which only the Founders could supply?
It made the Jem-Hadar the most loyal slaves in the
Galaxy. They were always desperate to get another dose of White from their
boss.
<p>
Maybe the A.A. God makes A.A. members similarly dependent on Him for
their sobriety. Either seek and follow the dictates of your Higher Power every day,
or else He will let you relapse and die a horrible painful drunken death.

Another thought that never seems to occur to the A.A. true believers is
the idea that maybe God doesn't want to be bothered with restoring all
of the A.A. members to sanity in Step Two, and taking care of the members'
wills and lives for them in Step Three.
Maybe God has other things to do.
Maybe God gave people their own wills and lives so that they
could live their own lives themselves.
There is an incredible amount of arrogance in this
Third Step. A.A. members assume that they can just shove their wills
and their lives at God for repair without even asking God what He wants.
<p>
What if God says,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Hey! You can't make me do all of your work for you.
I gave you perfectly good minds and wills and lives, and you broke them,
and now you think you can just give up, and shove them at me,
and demand that I fix them for you?
Screw you. Go fix them yourselves.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, God might say to them,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Here I am, the Lord, Creator, and God of the Universe.
I've got 50 billion galaxies to run, and each of them has 400
billion stars, and lots of those stars have planets orbiting them, and
lots of those planets have funny little crawly things on them, things
that swim or slither or fly or walk, blue and green growing things
that look like the biological disasters that you find in bachelor men's
refrigerators,
and you think I'm going to drop all of that and come running to your
little backwater planet, just because you drank too much alcohol and
now you want me to take care of your stupid life for you?
<p>
Think again...<br>
<p>
You want to be restored to sanity, and have a bunch of your problems solved?
Okay, try this simple one-step program:<br>

<b>4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</b>
</font>
<p>
Here's where we start wallowing in guilt, making long lists of everything that
might be wrong with us.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><b>Do I get to list my good qualities, too?</b></font>
<p>
No. This step is about guilt induction, not about getting honest
with yourself and finding out what and who you really are, by doing an
honest and complete inventory of <b>ALL</b> of your characteristics,
good, bad, and otherwise.
<p>
And this is just another
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">bait-and-switch trick</a>:
Since alcoholism is a medical problem &#8212; <font color="blue">&quot;an actual disease
that has a name and symptoms like diabetes or cancer or TB&quot;</font> is
<a href="orange-killjoy.html#revelation" target="_blank">what A.A. calls it</a>
&#8212; why doesn't Step Four tell us to do a
searching and fearless <b>medical examination</b>?
Why are we supposed to do a <b>moral inventory</b>?
<p>
The real answer is obvious: a medical examination won't induce enough
guilt to destroy our self-confidence and feelings of self-worth,
and make us surrender to the cult. And A.A. doesn't really consider alcoholism
to be a medical disease at all. They consider it to be a moral problem,
a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; that is caused by sin.
<p>

Charles Bufe said it so well:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unfortunately, the fourth step doesn't call for an inventory of irrational
beliefs, physical causes, or other contributory factors; it calls for a
<i>moral</i> inventory. What this has to do with recovery from
alcoholism is anybody's guess. Unless one believes that alcoholism
is caused by <i>sin</i>, this step makes no sense whatsoever.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Unfortunately, Bill Wilson was an enthusiastic Oxford Grouper and <i>did</i>,
at bottom, believe that alcoholism was caused by sin. If Wilson actually
believed that alcoholism was caused by an &quot;allergy,&quot; as Dr. Silkworth
speculates in the &quot;Big Book,&quot; it's extremely difficult to see
why he would have included the guilt-inducing, religious term &quot;moral&quot;
in this step. But at the time he wrote the steps, Wilson regarded the Oxford
Group Movement as his rescuer, and so it was natural that he would share the
assumption of the Groups that all human problems are a direct result of sin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In sum, this step is designed to produce guilt, and hence low self-esteem,
which tends to contribute to self-damaging rather than self-caring behavior.
Step four performs one other function: it prepares those being indoctrinated
into AA for the next step, <i>confession</i>.<br>

considered alcoholism to be a disease</a>, something like an

Bill Wilson was all mixed up. Natural desires do not supply us with
&quot;satisfactions or pleasures&quot;. Natural desires, like the
urges to eat or copulate, are itches and urges that drive us to go get some
satisfactions or pleasures.
The natural desire to eat food &#8212; hunger &#8212; doesn't give you any satisfaction
&#8212; it gives you a nagging pain in the belly.
<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
Nevertheless, according to the theology of Wilsonism,

&quot;how much we willfully demand more pleasure than is due us

And, according to Bill Wilson, alcoholism is just one of our many sins.
Alcoholism is just a
&quot;symptom&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
of our greater underlying sins and &quot;defects of character&quot;.

<p>
And you can't just quit drinking by yourself without the A.A.
religious program; that would be &quot;immoral&quot; because it wouldn't
deal with all of your other sins. Remember Frank Buchman's remarks
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#praise_Hitler" target="_blank">while praising Adolf Hitler</a>:
<p>
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Human problems aren't economic. They're moral

<p>
Buchman declared that
any attempts to solve social problems, or to improve the world,
by any means other than prayer, confession, and &quot;surrender
to God&quot; were &quot;immoral measures.&quot;
So Bill Wilson declared that the only acceptable answer to alcoholism
is to list and confess all of your sins and &quot;surrender
to God's will&quot;
(<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#receive_guidance" target="_blank">as defined by your sponsor, of course</a>).
Just quitting drinking without doing
the Twelve Steps will not solve the &quot;sin&quot; problem;
you will supposedly just become a
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunk</a>&quot;, and
that would be immoral.

<font size="+2">
<b>5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.</b>
</font>
<p>
Apparently, I don't get to list my good qualities, because
Bill is only talking about &quot;our wrongs&quot; now.
So much for doing a complete and thorough inventory.
<p>
That's another bait-and-switch trick:
<ul>
<li> First, they tell you that you are supposed to do &quot;a complete
and thorough moral inventory&quot;,
<li> But then this Step says that you are only supposed to talk about
your &quot;wrongs&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
<font color="blue">
It can't be a complete inventory without <i>both the positives and the negatives</i>.
</font>

<p>
Frank Buchman, Bill Wilson, and Dr. Bob Smith really did love a good confession
session, didn't they? Especially when it was other people
confessing <i>to them</i>, other people grovelling and wallowing in
guilt <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender2Bob" target="_blank">on their knees
<i>before them</i></a>, other people surrendering to them.

<p>
Bill Wilson used a business example in the <i>Big Book</i>,
and said that no business could
run for long without doing an inventory and seeing what shape it is in.
Agreed, in principle &#8212; Bill confused performing an inventory with
balancing the books &#8212; a business must do both an inventory and balance its books to see
the big financial picture. (And note that an inventory mostly counts <i>assets</i> &#8212;
valuable things like tools, equipment, and the goods in the warehouse.)
But a business that only counts its liabilities, and fails to
also count its assets, including the money in the bank and accounts receivable,
will have no idea what its financial condition really is.
<i>&quot;We have a lot of bills to pay, but how much money do
we have?&quot;</i>
That last item, how much money you have, makes a huge difference
in the big picture. Likewise, the good qualities that you have, and the good
character features that you have, make an enormous difference in
how you can expect to manage and live your life in the future.
<p>
It is good to do an honest self-assessment now and then, to do a reality
check, but that isn't what these steps really do.
<p>

This Step is also just some more of the previous Step's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">&quot;<b>medical
to moral morph</b>&quot; bait-and-switch stunt</a>.
<ul>
<li>
As a come-on, to get us to join, A.A. said that we were innocent,
that alcoholism is a hereditary disease and that we couldn't help
it &#8212; &quot;<i>we were powerless over alcohol</i>&quot; &#8212; and we
were spared from all feelings of guilt.
<a href="orange-killjoy.html#revelation" target="_blank">
The Big Book said</a>, &quot;<b><i>a disease was respectable,
not a moral stigma!</b></i>&quot;
<li>
But now, after we have joined, we suddenly find A.A. making us
feel horribly guilty, having to confess everything we ever did wrong in
our entire lives: <b><i>&quot;the exact nature of our wrongs.&quot;</i></b><br>
Whoops! What happened to &quot;not a moral stigma&quot;?
</ul>
<p>
This step is also a big part of the process of crushing an individual's
self-confidence and pride, and making him ready to surrender his mind
to the cult.

Bill Wilson claimed that we would get fantastic benefits from doing Step Five,
and confessing everything to someone else. He wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that when
he confessed his sins, &quot;the effect was electric&quot;. Bill also declared,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every twist of character,
every dark cranny of the past.
Once we have taken this step, withholding nothing, we are delighted.
We can look the world in the eye.
We can be alone at perfect peace and ease.
Our fears fall from us.
We begin to feel the nearness of our Creator.
We may have had certain spiritual beliefs, but now we begin
to have a spiritual experience.
The feeling that the drink problem has disappeared will often
come strongly.
We feel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with
the Spirit of the Universe.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Gee, we get a great spiritual experience and feel like we are walking hand-in-hand with
God on some broad highway in the sky just because we confess our sins to our sponsor?

<p>
<a name="Streiker_conversion"> </a>
Compare that to Lowell Streiker's description of conversion experiences in
revivalist churches:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The prospect is directly confronted with his sins. His physical and psychic space
are invaded by these self-confident strangers. He is discomforted and thrown
off balance. He becomes anxious. The group tells him that his feelings are caused
by his sinfulness. He is overcome with guilt and sadness. He realizes his
life is not working. Eagerly he confesses his shortcomings &#8212; sexual lapses,
lies, petty thievery, drug abuse, and so forth. Guided by the group, he prays
that God will forgive him and receive him as His child. He is urged, &quot;Ask
Jesus to come into your heart.&quot; He does, and the inner turmoil subsides.
The recruit senses an inner release and relief. The hugs and congratulations
of the group tell him that he belongs, that he has identity, that he is accepted.
Many ecstatic converts report, &quot;It was as though a great weight had been
lifted from my shoulders.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Gospel Time Bomb: Ultrafundamentalism and the Future of
America</i>, Lowell Streiker, page 81.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It was as though a great weight had been
lifted from my shoulders.&quot;</i>
</font>

Of course &#8212; the pressure builds and builds
until the moment of confession and surrender, and then the pressure is off.
What relief. The sudden release of tension is interpreted as a spiritual experience,
as being &quot;born again&quot;.
This is what <a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Robert Jay Lifton</a>
called <i>&quot;Mystical Manipulation&quot;</i> &#8212;
<ul>
<li>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Experiences are engineered to appear to be spontaneous, when,
in fact, they are contrived to have a deliberate effect&quot;</font>, and
<li>
<font color="blue">
&quot;People mistakenly attribute their experiences to spiritual
causes when, in fact, they are concocted by human beings&quot;</font>.
</ul>

<p>
With the Stepper, the pressure has been building all of the time he has
been writing his list of sins in the Fourth Step, and then, once he has
finally done his embarassing and humiliating Fifth Step, it's over, and
the pressure is off, and he feels such a release that Bill Wilson says
it's like walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe.

<p>
It's just like the old joke about the guy who was beating his head against a wall.
A friend asked him why he was doing it. The answer:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Because it feels <i>SO GOOD</i> when I stop.&quot;

<b>6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of

Heck yeh! I'm entirely ready to have God remove all of my defects,
if He will really do it. That would solve a lot of my problems.
Who wouldn't want to be perfect? Does He do warts and wrinkles, too?
</font>

<p>
This step is rather ridiculous. It looks like Bill Wilson had only eleven
steps, and wanted one more to make an even dozen (for reasons of numerology
and mystical numbers), so he shoved this step in here.
With all of the other steps, we actually do things.
With this step, we
waste one whole step just thinking about doing something, just getting
ready to do something, and then we spend the next step actually doing it.
This step is quite unnecessary. Step Seven will do the same thing by itself.

<p>
Note that what was merely a &quot;wrong&quot; action in Step Five
has become an
integral part of ourselves, a &quot;defect of character&quot; in Step Six.
And it will be a &quot;moral shortcoming&quot; in Step Seven.
Bill Wilson started off by saying that we merely needed to perform an innocuous-sounding
&quot;moral inventory&quot; in Step Four, but then he suddenly switched to
declaring that we have characters that are so horribly defective
that only God can remove all of the defects.<br>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">That's another bait-and-switch trick.</font><br>
<p>
Just because we made a stupid mistake and drank too much
doesn't mean that we have inherently defective characters.
Labeling parts of ourselves as defective is good for instilling
self-doubts and guilt (as part of a brainwashing program),
but not good for much else. It promotes mental illness, not mental health or
recovery.
<p>
That is a passive, infantile-narcissistic, approach to self-healing &#8212; we decide to
just beg God to fix us. Otherwise, we will do nothing to fix ourselves.
Again, we see the external, rather than internal, locus of control &#8212;
Somebody or Something Else manipulates us like puppets while we do nothing except
confess how bad we have been &#8212; &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot;
(or &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;, or &quot;Group Of Drug addicts&quot;)
supposedly controls our wills and our lives while we control nothing.

<a name="Step7"> </a>
<font size="+2">
<b>7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</b><p>
</font>
Ah, yes. Here is the problem. Is this a request, or a
demand? It looks a lot like a demand for a miracle.
It doesn't matter whether we &quot;humbly, on our knees&quot; beg God for a miracle
(like the original version of Step Seven said),
or arrogantly demand the miracle from God while we stand on our feet,
Step Seven is still
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle" target="_blank">a demand for a miracle</a>.
<p>
This step sounds a lot like,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God: either you remove all of my shortcomings and defects of
character, especially my desire to drink alcohol, or else I'll kill
myself on the stuff, and it will all be your fault.&quot;<br></font>
<p>
Suppose God says,
<font color="blue">
&quot;No. You made your bed, so you lie in it.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Then what? Nowhere else in these steps is there any alternate plan for
self-improvement in case God doesn't feel like obeying us and fulfilling our demands.

Apparently, God doesn't like to be blackmailed, because most
of the <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">

-->

<p>
On the other hand, if God really will remove all of my
&quot;wrongs&quot;, &quot;defects of character&quot;, and
&quot;shortcomings&quot;, does that mean that I turn into
Superman? This could make for a really neat movie:<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Having
been bitten by a radioactive God, Peter Parker found himself
transformed into a Superman without shortcomings or defects of
character, a morally superior being who existed only to serve God
whenever the Bat Signal shone in the night sky.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
&quot;What's that you say? No, I don't turn into Superman?<br>
&quot;You say there's this grand cosmic flash of light and God zaps me with
a lightning bolt and miraculously turns me into an ordinary stupid shmuck
just like I was before?<br>
&quot;Where's the fun in that?&quot;
</blockquote>
</font>

<p>
This step also has far too much Santa Claus spirituality for my tastes.
Notice the similarity between
<ol>
<li> writing a list of everything you want and then
mailing it to Santa Claus, begging Santa to bring you the goodies,
and
<li> writing a list of all of your defects and shortcomings,
and then reading it to God and begging God to remove those defects
and solve all of your problems for you.
</ol>

<p>
It's also a lot like rubbing Aladdin's lamp and getting the genie to grant you
three wishes. And the wishes we want granted are:
<ol>
<li> In Step Two, restore us to sanity.
<li> In Step Three, take care of our wills and our lives for us, including managing
our &quot;unmanageable&quot; lives.
<li> In Step Seven, remove all of our &quot;defects of character&quot; and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, including the desire to drink alcohol.

Bill Wilson took that occult practice and made it into A.A. Step Eleven.

<p>
Something that I have never heard a stepper explain is how,
while they practice Step Eleven, they distinguish between the Voice of God
giving them <i>Divine Guidance</i>, and the voice of
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">old Lizard Brain</a> (base brain)
while it demands its creature comforts:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;I'm hungry. Feed me. I'm thirsty. Drink. I'm horny. Screw that
attractive young female. I'm feeling uncomfortable; I hurt. Grab a painkiller &#8212; maybe
a cigarette and a beer and some dope...&quot;</i></font>
Bill Wilson did not have any teachings on that subject &#8212; no helpful advice
at all &#8212; he just said that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#absurd_ideas" target="_blank">you can get into all kinds of trouble</a>
and do stupid things while
practicing Step Eleven and believing that you are listening to the voice of God:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact
with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired
at all times.

</blockquote>
<p>
And, for those who believe in the Devil, and demons, we have the big question of how to tell whether
an evil demon is whispering in your ear. Bill Wilson reported that he received messages from all kinds
of evil spirits (and somehow, he had no problem with being deceived by lying evil spirits):
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The ouija board got moving in earnest. What followed was the fairly usual
experience &#8212; it was a strange m&eacute;lange of Aristotle, St. Francis, diverse
archangels with odd names, deceased friends &#8212; some in purgatory and others doing
nicely, thank you! There were malign and mischievous ones of all descriptions,
telling of vices quite beyond my ken, even as former alcoholics. Then, the seemingly
virtuous entities would elbow them out with messages of comfort, information,
advice &#8212; and sometimes just sheer nonsense.&quot;<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson claimed that we are mentally incompetent and unfit to receive messages
from the spirits or &quot;Higher Power&quot; or &quot;God&quot; (a problem that he didn't have):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... if all our lives we had more or less fooled ourselves, how could we
now be so sure that we weren't still self-deceived? &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... what comes to us alone may be garbled by our own rationalization and wishful
thinking.  &nbsp; ...<br> 
How many times have we heard well-intentioned people claim the
guidance of God when it was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken.
Lacking both practice and humility, they had deluded themselves and
were able to justify the most arrant nonsense on the ground
that this was what God had told them.<br>
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;<br>
Surely then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>
</font>

<p>
Nevertheless, Bill Wilson told us to go ahead and do Step Eleven anyway.
And then you are supposed to do whatever the voices in your head tell you to do.
Really. Literally. You are supposed to spend the rest of your life
&quot;seeking and doing the Will of God&quot;, however you hear
&quot;the Will of God&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>

Worse yet, after you get your work orders from &quot;God
as you understand Him&quot; in Step Eleven, you are supposed to
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">submit those orders for the
approval of your sponsor or other group elders</a>.

Theoretically,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#self_deceived" target="_blank">
your sponsor is supposed to save you</a> from your own stupidity by
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">interpreting your

<p>
But that just means that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_deceived" target="_blank">it will be
your sponsor who decides</a> what God said and
what God wishes for you to do.

<li> And how do we know that he won't take advantage of the situation while
he is giving you his interpretation of <i>The Word of God</i>?

</font>

And that's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#self_deceived" target="_blank">yet another Alcoholics Anonymous
bait-and-switch trick</a>:
<ul>
<li> First, they tell you that you are supposed to listen to the Voice of God, and do what He says.
<li> And then Bill Wilson tells you to listen to the voice of your sponsor and

<p>
Bill Wilson copied this bait-and-switch trick from the Oxford Group, along with all of the other
theology of Buchmanism:
<p>
<a name="paradox"> </a>
<center>
<table border="3" width="99%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham, pointed out that Buchman's
doctrine of <i>Checking Guidance</i> created a great contradiction:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the Groupist system, although the individual is encouraged to attach
Divine authority to the 'luminous thoughts' which visit the mind during the
'Quiet Time', and may be written down in his 'Guidance Book', and although
he is urged to govern his daily course, even in the pettiest details and
in spite of the dislocation of carefully-prearranged engagements which may
be entailed by his obedience to their direction, external authority is not
lacking. Above the Groupist there is the Group to which he is attached, and
beyond the Group there is an 'Inner Group' over which Dr. Buchman himself
presides, and whose decisions are final. Groupism is thus a closed system,
as close-knit and dominating as that of the Jesuits, which leaves to the
individual Groupist little liberty and no ultimate responsibility.
In a recently published letter, expressed with gravity and restraint,
twelve Evangelical clergymen resident in Oxford have instanced this aspect
of the Movement as one of the objections which may be fairly urged against
it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Swiss,SansSerif,Courier">
'They [sc. the Groups] insist that individual guidance must be &quot;checked&quot;
(i.e. tested and approved) by the collective guidance of the Group, with
ultimate reference to the &quot;Inner Group&quot; of which Dr. Buchman is the head.
Loyalty to the Group &#8212; as being directly controlled by the Holy Spirit &#8212;
is the dominating factor in determining the actions and choices of its
members.'
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We seem to be contemplating a paradox.
A religious movement which begins
by ignoring all existing systems, and claims to have none of its own,
ends by becoming a system more despotic than any!
</font>
In order to 'check'
the marching orders from on high which the Groupist has been taught to
count upon, and which in fact he claims to have received, the movement
has found itself forced to create a 'checking' machinery which robs the
Groupist of his private judgement, and binds him to an unquestioning
obedience to the verdicts of another authority than that of the 'luminous
thought' which he was originally required to look on as Divine!<br>

<p>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Indeed. &quot;A system more despotic than any!&quot;
 It would seem that Frank Buchman got to over-ride &quot;the Word of God&quot;
whenever he felt like it. No matter what &quot;God&quot; seemed to have said
to a Group member during his <i>Quiet Time</i>,
it was Frank Buchman and his lieutenants who got to decide what God really said.
<p>
That is a classic example of a bait and switch trick &#8212; you start off
being told to listen to God, but you end up being told to listen to the
cult leader &#8212; and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#surrender2God" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous
still uses the same trick today</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The individual ... is merged into the group, the 'Cell', the state, and
as such is bound into a system more analogous to the polity of bees
or ants than anything properly human.
The Buchmanite group reminds us irresistably of the Russian soviet, and
&quot;Frank's&quot; sovereignty in the one system is not wholly unlike that of Lenin
or Stalin in the other.<br>

<p><br>
There is also another contradiction here: We are supposed to be
<i>&quot;praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power
to carry that out.&quot;</i> This is classic Buchmanism. In Buchmanism,
you are not supposed to pray for anything for yourself. You can
forget about
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Janis" target="_blank">Janis Joplin's funny song</a>,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Oh Lord, won't you buy me a color TV...&quot;
</font>
It shouldn't apply to good Buchmanites.
<p>
But in Step Seven, we specifically make a huge request for something for
ourselves &#8212; we make an extremely selfish request &#8212; we ask God to
perform a miracle for us, to interfere with physical reality and
change us into something much greater: a creature without &quot;moral
shortcomings&quot; or &quot;defects of character&quot; &#8212; an alcoholic who
does not drink alcohol any more.
<p>
And, for that matter, we also want God to
manage our lives and make us quit drinking in Step One,
restore us to sanity in Step Two,
and take good care of our wills and our lives for us in Step Three,
so we really want God to be doing lots of work for us.
God will be waiting on us hand and foot.
<p>
So which is it, praying <b>only</b> for &quot;knowledge of God's will and
the power to carry it out&quot;, or also selfishly praying for the
miraculous transformation of ourselves into superior spiritual beings, and
praying for God to take care of us and solve our problems?
<p>
Well, Bill Wilson wrote that it was the latter. His Third Step Prayer begs God to:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to
those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life.<br>

Step 11 reveals a complete lack of humility in A.A.
Bill Wilson loved to brag about humility, but that is a sham.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are told in Al-Anon that there can be no progress without humility.
This idea is confusing to many at first, and it almost always encounters
a stubborn resistance in us. &quot;What!&quot; we say, &quot;am I
supposed to be a submissive slave to my situation and accept
everything that comes, however humiliating?&quot; No. True humility
does not mean a meek surrender to an ugly, destructive way of life.
It means surrender to God's will, which is quite a different thing.
Humility prepares us for the realization of God's will for us;
it shows us the benefits we gain from doing away with self-will.
We finally understand how this self-will has actually contributed to
our distress.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>One Day At A Time In Al-Anon</i>,
Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, 1990, page 61.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Notice
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#12X12q8" target="_blank">the word redefinition game</a>:
&quot;Humility&quot; does not mean &quot;surrender to God's will&quot;.)

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So it is that we first see humility as a necessity.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 73.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
In truth, the A.A. attitude is, <b>&quot;I am so holy and so special that I have
a direct hotline to God, and He gives me his personal attention, and God talks to
me and gives me instructions and wisdom, and work orders and the power to carry
them out, while God ignores six billion other less-worthy souls. Not only that, I
am also very, very humble.&quot;</b>
<p>
That is not humility, that is extreme arrogance and delusions of grandeur.
<p>

**     is pride that apes humility.

Frank Buchman routinely called his group practices &quot;spiritual principles&quot;, and

<p>
Here are some spiritual principles that you can live by, and practice
in all of your affairs:<br>

<ul>
<li> Thou shalt not steal.
<li> Thou shalt not commit adultery.
<li> Those shalt not lie.
<li> Those shalt not deceive others in order to get them to join your religion.
<li> Thou shalt not commit murder.
<li> Play fair.
<li> Be nice.
<li> Never forget a debt; always forgive a debtor.
<li> A stitch in time saves nine.
<li> Love thy neighbor as thy self. 
<li> Love thy God as thy self.
<li> Be tolerant of your friends' and neighbors' faults and weaknesses.
<li> Look for the best in others, not the worst.
<li> Never miss the opportunity to do someone a kindness; always
skip the opportunity to be unkind and cause someone pain.
<li> Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
<li> Be compassionate.
<li> Do not take part in racism or religious bigotry.
<li> Honesty is the best policy.

<b>&quot;Symptom&quot;:</b>
&nbsp; Both Bill Wilson and Marty Mann misused the word &quot;symptom&quot;.
According to Ms. Mann, from reading the <i>Big Book</i>, she learned that alcoholism is ...
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... an actual disease that has a name and symptoms like
diabetes or cancer or TB.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Marty Mann, page 227 of the 3rd edition.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

The <i>symptoms</i> of a disease are those things that the patient complains
about, like &quot;My throat hurts. I feel awful.&quot;
A doctor observes the <i>signs</i> of a disease, like &quot;The patient's
temperature is 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and he is flushed and sweating,
his throat is red, and the lab tests say that he has a streptococcus infection.&quot;
<p>
If alcoholism were really a spiritual disease that is caused by sin, as 
Bill Wilson claimed, then drinking alcohol would be a <i>sign</i> of the
underlying spiritual disease, not a <i>symptom</i>.
<p>
And a disease that has <i>only symptoms</i> is called
<a href="orange-letters406.html#Dr_Chris" target="_blank">a <i>hysterical illness</i></a>.
They say that it's all in your head. I never heard a competent doctor declare
that alcoholism was a hysterical illness.
