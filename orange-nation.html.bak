<center>          <h2>Alcoholics Anonymous, the Dangers of Success</h2>
            <p>By Jerome Ellison</p>
</center>
            <p>Back in 1940, the late John D. Rockefeller, Jr., made headlines (John D.
              Dines Tosspots) by asking 400 of his wealthy friends to dine at New
              York's Union League Club and hear about a society of impoverished drunks
              called Alcoholics Anonymous. At that time the fellowship had been
              struggling along for a little more than four years and had about a
              hundred members.</p>
            <p>John D. got sick at the last minute and his son Nelson presided. About
              seventy-five people showed up. The former drunks gave impressive
              testimony of their suffering, restitution and recovery. The assembled
              millionaires were impressed, and the ex-boozers figured their society's
              financial troubles were over. But, winding up the evening, the host
              expressed his father's belief that money would not be a good thing for a
              movement based on selfless service &#8212; &quot;it needs only our good will.&quot; The
              millionaire went home without being asked to contribute.</p>
            <p>Now, twenty-four years older and with a membership of 300,000 A.A. is
              rich in its own right. Despite bylaws prohibiting gifts larger than $100,
              money pours in to national headquarters at the rate of more than $400,000
              a year and A.A. doesn't seem to know what to do with it all. Once a year
              it spends $20,000 or so to bring 100 delegates in from the fifty states
              for a week-long, all expense paid conference at a New York hotel. It has
              leased a floor in a midtown New York office building, where a dozen
              recovered housewives and spinsters answer letters, distribute pamphlets
              containing material on alcoholism purchased from free-lance writers,
              circulate a monthly bulletin of member's stories, articles, jokes and
              cartoons called the Grapevine, print and mail press releases, and go to
              meetings.</p>
            <p>These workers receive annual salaries of $7,000 to $9,000 and are backed
              by a staff of stenographers and clerical employees &#8212; nonmembers. Herb M.,
              a member with experience as a press agent and convention manager is paid
              $18,000 a year for part-time services (three and a third days a week).
              The rest of the money goes into sinking funds, which have no specific
              purpose, but are nice to have, since they produce, in the form of
              interest, more money for sinking funds. Bill W., the movements surviving
              co-founder makes around $25,000 per year &#8212; a sum a grateful membership
              does not begrudge &#8212; on royalties from three books: Alcoholics Anonymous,
              which started it all, Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions and A.A. Comes
              of Age. For a movement that was born and grew to greatness in the face of
              ridicule, adversity and bitter poverty, this is indeed wealth. Even if
              Nelson Rockefeller's canny father had never suggested it, the question
              would now arise whether the success will prove ruinous.</p>
            <p>The prodigies of selfless service performed by members have had a
              stunning impact on a basically me-first society. Press, clergy and the
              professions have fallen all over one another to heap praise on the drunks
              who found a way out, and for a long time it has been almost bad manners
              to speak of A.A. in any but reverent terms.</p>
            <p>Now, however, it is a public institution and subject to the same scrutiny
              accorded other community volunteer services. There are A.A. qroups in
              every crossroads and neighbourhood &#8212; 10,000 of them. They have become
              almost as much a part of the community scene as the visiting nurse and
              the fire department, which they somewhat resemble. In a population
              containing 80 million users of Alcohol and 6 million cases of active
              alcoholism, they perform as necessary a life-saving function as the Coast
              Guard. Alcoholism has pressed its way into public attention as the
              nation's third deadliest disease, and A.A. has developed the only method
              yet found that produces large numbers of enduring cures, It suddenly
              finds that it has public responsibilities, that others besides its
              members claim a legitimate interest in how it conducts its affairs.</p>
            <p>Many find the fellowship of interest entirely apart from its practical
              work of sobering up drunks. Though itself nonintellectual and sometimes
              anti-intellectual, A.A. strikes both therapists and theorists as being an
              almost classical demonstration of the psychotherapeutic theories of Carl
              Jung. Jung believed in God and in &quot;spirit.&quot; He devised another vocabulary
              for transactions with agnostic professional colleagues, but firmly used
              these traditional terms in his correspondence. A good part of his life
              work was directed towards reconciling the insights of religion with those
              of the new psychiatry. Jung approved Freud's work as far as it went, but
              felt that forces unsuspected by Freud could be summoned to the aid of
              distressed humanity. This belief is also at the base of A.A., commonly
              described by its members as a &quot;spiritual program.&quot;</p>
            <p>This resemblance is not entirely coincidental for, though he did not know
              it and though his contribution was inadvertent, Jung had a hand in
              founding A.A. Early in the 1930s, Jung took a patient named Rolland H., a
              rich American and chronic alcoholic frantically seeking a cure. After an
              attempt at treatment, Jung told Rolland H. that psychiatry couldn't help
              him. Then, asked the desperate patient, what could? Perhaps a religious
              conversion of some kind, Jung said. Such an experience could never be
              guaranteed, but one could seek the company of those who had had them, and
              hope. Roland H. went to England, joined the Oxford movement, got sober
              and returned to New York. There he continued his association with the
              Oxford movement, taking particular interest in other inebriates. One of
              these Edwin T., carried the news to Bill W., a Wall Street broker, then
              prostrated by alcohol. After undergoing a shattering subjective
              experience of religious enlightenment, Bill W got sober and began looking
              for other alcoholics who were interested in drying out by the new method.
              He found one &#8212; again through the Oxford movement &#8212; on a business trip to
              Akron, Ohio. His new friend was a down-and-out alcoholic physician, Dr.
              Robert S. The two founded Alcoholics Anonymous and led the movement
              jointly until Robert S. died, sober in 1950.</p>
            <p>A.A. was not completely without precedent. More than a century ago, a
              remarkable similar organization, The Washington Temperance Society,
              sprang up in Washington, D.C. and soon had branches in most big cities.
              Lincoln, concerned about alcoholism through the suffering of his law
              partner, Herndon, encouraged the members whenever he could, and even
              addressed them on one occasion. The Washingtonians had all the main
              features of A.A. &#8212; alcoholics helping one another, weekly alcoholics
              meetings, shared experience, readily available group fellowship, reliance
              on &quot;the Higher Power.&quot; Bill W. and Bob S., added a spiritual regimen
              designed to produce personal improvement, a rule of anonymity, the
              practice of exchanging speakers between groups, and a membership
              restricted to those who confessed a problem with alcohol. The Twelve
              Steps of surrender, confession, self-examination, restitution and service
              were taken with only slight changes from the Oxford movement. The
              anonymity and alcoholics only rules were innovations.</p>
            <p>AAs great expansion began with the publication of an article by Jack
              Alexander in the Saturday Evening Post of March 1, 1941. Ten years later
              the membership was up to 150,000: in ten more years it doubled that.
              America was suffering from the hangovers of a national binge begun with
              the repeal of Prohibition and not yet ended. By aggressive lobbying, the
              liquor industry cleared away the remaining restraints on the sale of
              booze. Saturation advertising disfigured the approaches to the major
              cities with five story whiskey bottles and bombarded the populace with
              reminders to drink. Consumption rose until it reached the present figures
              of a billion quarts of spirits, 2 billion quarts of wine and 12 billion
              quarts of beer a year. The industry employs a million people and pays
              them $5 billion a year &#8212; more than we spend on the combined crude oil,
              natural gas, coal and ore-mining industries, and nearly twice what we
              spend on education.</p>
            <p>Trouble arose along with sales figures. Those who drink consume, on the
              average, a quart of whiskey, two quarts of wine and four gallons of beer
              a month. Some, of course drink far less than this, others &#8212; especially the
              6 million chronic alcoholics &#8212; much more. Excessive drinking costs the
              nation $35 million annually in medical care, $30 million in jail
              maintenance, $100 million in accidents, $500 million in wage losses,
              according to estimates based on a Public Affairs Committee pamphlet.
              About a million people a year are admitted to be treated for alcoholism.
              One in twelve drinkers becomes an alcoholic: 14,000 deaths and 40,000
              injuries a year result from the mixture of alcohol and traffic. 21,000
              people die annually from cirrhosis, 6 million families are shadowed by
              alcohol and 12 million children suffer from their parents excessive
              drinking.</p>
            <p>In the light of such figures, it is not surprising that A.A. seemed an
              answer to prayer in hundreds of thousands of families. A household
              devastated by booze is an isolated unit, plagued by debt, ridden by
              internal strife, with little hope, few friends, many enemies and a
              skeleton grown too big for the closet. AA replaces despair with hope. The
              family has friends again, understanding friends, people who have been
              through the mill, ready at any time for a cup of coffee and a chat. The
              necessity of total abstinence, and the means for attaining it, are made
              clear. The transformations are so impressive, and so often enduring, that
              the word &quot;miracle&quot; is frequently and understandably employed. Even
              physicians and psychiatrists, conditioned by occupation to disregard the
              claims of laymen, sought to learn from AAs source of clinical information
              on the management of a syndrome that had baffled their professions.</p>
            <p>Alcoholics, even sober ones, are only human, and can tolerate only
              limited amounts of adulation without becoming dizzy. Effective speakers
              were in great demand to tell their &quot;stories,&quot; not only at AA weekly
              meetings in distant places, but at convocations of professional groups,
              civic associations and service clubs. Big city groups stage annual
              banquets drawing up to a thousand people and costing up to $10 a plate.
              Resort hotels are taken over for State and regional conventions. All this
              has gone to the head of many a reformed booze fighter, and a type of
              paragon known in the local groups as &quot;Mr. AA&quot; pushed himself into key
              positions in the committee structure.</p>
            <p>As AA became more prominent this tendency was noted outside the
              organization, and drew comment. A group of letters addressed last year to
              the editor of Harper's, was pointed: &quot;Now that the myth of the
              Golden-Hearted prostitute has been laid to rest, let's tackle the
              Omniscient Ex-Lush.&quot; &quot;The fanatics who prevail in some groups seem bent
              on making AA into a hostile, fundamentalist religion.&quot; &quot;The movement
              needs to recover some of the good spirit it had before it became proud of
              its humility.&quot; These letters were occasioned by an article in which
              Arthur Cain pointed out tendencies toward cultism and narrow orthodoxy
              that limited the fellowship's therapeutic effectiveness.</p>
            <p>My own experience with AA dates back more than 10 years. While writing a
              series of articles for a national magazine, I attended hundreds of AA
              local meetings and a number of state and regional affairs, and developed
              a wide acquaintanceship in the movement. My articles aroused the interest
              of Bill W., and I was invited to evaluate, as a paid consultant, some of
              AAs publications and activities.</p>
            <p>This chore consumed a number of months in 1962 and 1963, and afforded an
              intimate view of the organization's national headquarters and policy
              making boards. Since my recommendations were not confidential &#8212; &quot;AA has no
              secrets but the names of its members&quot; is a hallowed tenet &#8212; they can be
              disclosed. They contained little more that had not been said before, some
              of it by Arthur Cain. Anyone else undertaking a similar survey would, I
              think, have reached the same conclusions.</p>
            <p>At headquarters, I missed almost completely the bubbling good will, the
              creative open-mindedness, the open and stimulating swapping of ideas that
              made so many of the weekly neighborhood meetings memorable. Everybody was
              an expert, with a cluster of ideas closed to amendment. Bill W., The
              movement's traditional leader and a main source of the spiritual
              inspiration, had lost out in committee maneuvering to a policy of
            &quot;putting the thing on a business basis.&quot; Committee politics took up half
              the working day; gossip was venomous. In quick succession I was told that
              the co-founder (in my opinion still sharp-witted at seventy) was senile,
              that a staff worker was a hypochondriac and a committeeman a homosexual.
              The accused were at pains to assure me, separately and without
              encouragement, that the accusers were a nymphomaniac, a schizophrenic and
              a megalomaniac, I observed nothing to substantiate any of these charges.
              However, there was no inclination toward the &quot;fearless and searching
              moral inventory&quot; recommended by AAs Twelve Suggested Steps.</p>
            <p>The non-alcoholic Board of Trustees responsible for national policy was
              ultraconservative (one member, Archibald Roosevelt, had furnished
              literature for distribution by the John Birch Society) and this, I
              reported, had served the movement poorly. The board's rigid conservatism
              was reflected in a number of unfortunate policies, the most odious of
              which was a tact endorsement of racial segregation within the branches.
              When a member submitted an article for the monthly bulletin pointing out
              that nearly all Southern AA groups and a great many Northern ones were
              racially segregated, and that AAs Negro membership had failed to keep
              pace with the growing problem of Negro alcoholism, the article was turned
              down on the grounds that it &quot;might disrupt AA unity.&quot; Local AA groups are
              free from any national control other than moral suasion. That even this
              influence should be withheld on so fundamental point seemed to me a
              serious error. It is, however, in keeping with the fact that there are no
              Negroes on the headquarters staff or on any of the numerous AA national
              boards and committees.</p>
            <p>The policy on publications, I reported, is likely to cost AA its once
              acknowledged leadership in its field. When Alcoholics Anonymous was first
              published a quarter of a century ago, it won universal acknowledgement
              that AA was well in advance of the field. But though the medical and
              psychiatric professions have been remarkably slow in coming to terms with
              alcohol addiction, much progress has lately been made, and the AA &quot;Big
              Book&quot; is beginning to have an Out-of-date, early century, historical
              sound. The Board, however, has ruled that no further word shall be
              spoken. Despite the fact that the rank and file teems with exciting,
              relevant, informed and up-to-the-minute experience, none of it is
              permitted to appear in book form. To publish such literature, it is felt,
              would be to risk heresy. As a result, AAs official books, unfertilized by
              fresh documentation, tend to sound more archaic each year.</p>
            <p>I concluded that AAs headquarters had been captured by an
              ultraconservative clique that was doing the society appreciable harm.
              This finding, was, of course, received by that clique without thanks and,
              despite the efforts of a small free-speech party, was prevented from
              reaching the delegates of the rank and file for whom it was intended. AA,
              at least in its national offices, bears heavily the marks of its culture
              in its time &#8212; affluence and the shortsighted conservatism that affluence
              begets.</p>
            <p>Fortunately for future generations, the influence of headquarters on
              local groups is not decisive. &quot;Oh, those guys!&quot;, is a typical reaction
              from a local group secretary. &quot;We send 'em their three bucks a year per
              member and forget about 'em.&quot; Many groups make no contributions to &quot;the
              national.&quot; In the neighborhoods and at the crossroads will surely be
              preserved in living practice those ideas that give mankind new hope
              whenever they achieve a renaissance &#8212; candor, humility, friendliness,
              enlightened understanding, a good-natured readiness to pitch in at any
              hour in any way to help a baffled human being.</p>

While the author was candid about the infighting at the A.A. headquarters, he
repeated so many of the regular A.A. myths and lies.  The article parrots so much
of the standard A.A. party line, and common fallacies.

Actually, Bill Wilson went through a drug experience, getting stoned out of his gourd on
the poisonous hallucinogen belladonna, and henbane and morphine, and many other toxic chemicals, while detoxing.

<p>
Wrong. Bill Wilson was not a stock broker, in spite of his lies in the <i>Big Book</i>.
Bill Wilson was just a Wall Street hustler who participated in stock market swindles.
Bill Wilson was never trained as a stock broker, was never licensed as a stock broker,
and never worked for a stock brokerage firm trading stocks. The closest Bill Wilson
ever did was investigating stocks for their potential as targets for speculation and
pump-and-dump stock market swindles.

Back in 1940, ... At that time the fellowship had been struggling along for a

Wrong. In 1936, Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob, and Clarence Snyder were all members of the Oxford Group,
enthusiastically recruiting more alcoholics for the O.G. while the leader Frank Buchman went to
Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies and <i>Sieg-Heil</i>ed! Adolf Hitler,
and attended the Berlin Olympics as the personal guest of the
Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler.
There was no such thing as Alcoholics Anonymous then, so &quot;the fellowship&quot; was not &quot;struggling along&quot;.
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">More on the Nazi connection here</a>.
<p>
Bill Wilson was kicked out of the Oxford Group for failure to follow orders in the spring of 1937.
Dr. Bob and Clarence Snyder didn't quit the Oxford Group and start independent ex-drinkers
meetings until 1939.
So by 1940, &quot;the fellowship&quot; had not been &quot;struggling along&quot; for four years.

<p>
Wrong. The American Medical Association reviewed the book and found it to be worthless:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The book contains instructions as to how to intrigue the alcoholic addict
into the acceptance of divine guidance in place of alcohol in terms
strongly reminiscent of Dale Carnegie and
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">the adherents of the Buchman
(&quot;Oxford&quot;) movement</a>. The one
valid thing in the book is the recognition of the seriousness of addiction
to alcohol. Other than this, the book has no scientific merit or interest.<br>

These workers receive annual salaries of $7,000 to $9,000 and are backed by a staff

Bill W., the movements surviving co-founder makes around $25,000 per year  &#8212;
 a sum a grateful membership does not begrudge  &#8212;  on royalties from three
books: Alcoholics Anonymous, which started it all, Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions
and A.A. Comes of Age.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Wrong. The myth of the underpaid A.A. workers hides the fact that the founder Bill Wilson always had his hand in the cookie
jar. He got an estate in the country, a Cadillac car, and a harem of mistresses, and died a millionaire,
while never working a straight job again. That also hides the fact that Bill Wilson stole the copyright on
the <i>Big Book</i> &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.

</blockquote>

<p>
Wrong.
That is the old myth of &quot;the Good Old Days&quot;.
A.A. was supposedly great in the beginning, and only went downhill recently.
(And the belief is, if we can &quot;get back to the basics&quot;, that everything will be okay.
There is no truth to it. A.A. was always an irrational dogmatic cult religion.

<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But though the medical and psychiatric professions have been remarkably slow in coming to terms with alcohol addiction, much progress has lately been made, and the AA &quot;Big Book&quot; is beginning to have an Out-of-date, early century, historical sound. The Board, however, has ruled that no further word shall be spoken. Despite the fact that the rank and file teems with exciting, relevant, informed and up-to-the-minute experience, none of it is permitted to appear in book form.

<p>
Wrong.
This is wrong on several points:
<ul>
<p><li> The medical and psychiatric professions <b>were not</b> &quot;remarkably slow in coming to terms with alcohol addiction&quot;.
That is the arrogant self-congratulatory myth that A.A. is better than doctors. There is no truth to that.

<p><li> It is not the fault of &quot;the Board&quot; that A.A. is still selling an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties.

<p><li>
The &quot;rank and file&quot; has not come up with &quot;exciting, relevant, informed and up-to-the-minute experience&quot;. The rank and file
parrots the standard mythology the same way as this article is doing. Even Bill Wilson himself complained that he could
not update the <i>Big Book</i> because the membership would not stand for it. They felt that even changing a few words
was heresy.
