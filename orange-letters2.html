&gt; Hey Orange!
&gt; 
&gt; How ya doin?
&gt; I love all the hard work you have put into your site.
&gt; Finally it seems someone has done all the needed homework to tell
&gt; the truth!!
&gt; "The truth will set you Free"  Oh shit- an AA slogan!!  opps  sorry
&gt; 
&gt; I take cheap shots at some AA'ers I know.
</pre><p>

<font color="blue">
I have the same problem myself. I really have to strain to
avoid doing it... Sometimes, it's so much fun. :-)
</font>

<pre>
&gt; I have some friends who are meeting junkies and it's such a hoot
&gt; to see them look so threatened when I say some good anti AA stuff
&gt; to them. They actually freak and storm off to pout. It's a riot.
&gt; I should get my camcorder next time....
&gt; 
&gt; I have coined a new slogan here in Utah- at the Alano club   &#8212;
&gt; 
&gt; "P 33's"    Referring to the statement about the potential Alcohol
&gt; women found on page 33 of the Big Book...

<font color="blue">
I don't have my book handy at this minute. I'll check it when
I get home.

Okay, it says:
<blockquote>

To be gravely affected, one does not necessarily have to drink a
long time nor take the quantities some of us have. This is particularly
true of women. Potential female alcoholics often turn into the real

&gt; So a lot of my friends have started to use that to describe the
&gt; women they know in AA or for that matter married to.  
&gt; Jesus- you should see one of those women when they find out what
&gt; "P33" means!!
&gt; Total meltdown. Freaked completely!!!!  Well- it IS true!!!
&gt; Hilarious!!  but true...
&gt; 
&gt; Have you read the 4th printing of the Big Book yet??  It would
&gt; probably give you more chills with the NEW stuff that I have heard
&gt; was in the story section.  I won't read that!!  That's for sure!

Dear secret agent:<br>
<br>
Thanks for putting these great articles on your site.  You've
covered an
amazingly large number of AA misrepresentations, more than anyone
has. My
favorite area is the claim that James and Jung were &quot;founders&quot; of
 AA. The
idea seems to be that if from the very beginning these exalted men of
science
were endorsing the spiritual approach, no one else should quibble.
 I've
even seen people writing about Jung (not just steppers) who quote
Bill Wilson's
fake conversation between Rowland and Jung, for all the world as
though it
were a quote from Jung.   This is done even by people who ought
to know that
those expressions were uncharacteristic of Jung.<br>
<br>
Another &quot;irony&quot;: the implication that James was a hard-headed
sceptical pragmatist
who was, against his intellectual instincts, won over to the
spiritual point
of view.  In fact, Varieties of Religious Experience had very
little to do
with his psychological writings.  James merely recycled
Scheiermacher's theology,
 blending it with pragmatic philosophy.  Nothing wrong with
 a psychologist
choosing to write something in the field of religion, but it is
certainly
dishonest of later writers to imply that this is the judgement of
science.<br>
<br>
I suppose you are aware that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung">the Rowland Hazard/Carl Jung
story</a> has largely
fallen apart. Hazard's papers left with the Rhode Island historical
society
are quite detailed about his activities during those years and he was
not
in Zurich.  He was in therapy with Courtenay Baylor in Boston,
however, and
Baylor's mentor Elwood Worcester seems to have quoted Jung
frequently. Maybe
that was the &quot;connection&quot;.<br>
<br>
What a fascinating body of mythology.  If only more people
realized that
that's what it is.<br>

Excerpt from THE FORERUNNER - ROWLAND<br>
By: Ron Ray yarnor@msn.com<br>
140 Dove Trail Bowling Green, KY 42101<br>
</center>
<p>

We know from Bill's letter of January 23, 1961, to Dr. Jung that Rowland
was under Dr. Jung's care in Zurich, Switzerland in 1931. On page 26
of the Big Book we find more insight into Rowland's battle with alcohol:
&quot;For years he had floundered from one sanitarium to another. He had
consulted the best known American psychiatrists.&quot; This short statement
leads us to believe that several years prior to 1931 Rowland and his
family sought solutions to his problem with alcohol. Ebby Thacher who
carried the message to Bill had this to say about Rowland: &quot;I was very
much impressed by his drinking career, which consisted of prolonged
sprees where he traveled all over the country.&quot;
The 1927-35 period is vague and sketchy. In published accounts of Rowland's
life (Yale Class Reunion Books and obituaries) one is left with the feeling he
and the family went to great effort to explain his absence from the business
world.
<p>

According to published accounts, the eight-year period was a mixture of
health problems and private ventures away from Peace Dale and New York City.
While in Africa the reports say he contracted a tropical disease, and in 1928
he traveled to the Pacific Coast for his health. In 1929 he bought a ranch in
New Mexico. Upon discovery of high-grade clay on the ranch, he organized in
1931-32 the La Luz Clay Products Company to produce floor and roof tile. In
1932 he took up residence in Vermont. Between 1932 and 1936 he divided much of
his time between Vermont and New Mexico. There is never any mention of
Rowland's travel to Zurich in 1931 nor the &quot;about one year&quot; spent in Dr. Jung's
care. (Mentioned in Bill's January 23, 1961 letter to Dr. Jung.) In the letter
to Dr. Jung, Bill writes, &quot;Mr. Hazard joined the Oxford Groups, an evangelical
movement then at the height of its success in Europe...

<a name="Cebra_Graves"> </a>
Returning to New York
he became very active with &quot;O.G.&quot; here, then led by an Episcopal Clergyman, Dr.
Samuel Shoemaker.&quot; August 1934 Rowland was at his home in Shaftsbury, Vt., 15
miles south of Manchester. It was during this stay in Shaftsbury that he
learned through two Groupers of Ebby Thacher's possible six-month sentence to
Windsor Prison for repeated drunkenness. The Groupers were Shep Cornell and
Cebra Graves. Cebra's uncle was Judge Graves before whom Ebby was to appear in
Bennington, Vt. Rowland and Cebra intervened at the hearing and asked to have
Ebby be bound over to Rowland who would take him to New York. Judge Graves
agreed and Rowland took Ebby to his home in Shaftsbury.<br>
...<br>
It was reported to me that Helen and Rowland were divorced for short
period circa 1929/31. I have no hard evidence to this claim, but it
would fit in to the chain of events around Rowland seeking help from
Dr Jung.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
[Or it could have provided the impetus to get therapy from
the free-lance therapist Courtenay Baylor in Boston.]
</font>
<p>
La Luz, New Mexico certainly does exist.
My geolocator says:<br>
<font face="Courier" size="3">
<pre>
La Luz, N.M. = 105.953397 W. Longitude, 32.977449 N. Latitude
Albuquerque  = 106.550605               35.056116
</pre>
</font>
<br>
so La Luz is way South and a bit East of Albuquerque, down in the really
hot, flat, desolate area.
It's highly believable that Rowland found clay down there. Half of
New Mexico is just one giant adobe brick. Finding clay in New Mexico
is sort of like finding water in the ocean.

<p>
It would seem that Rowland Hazard was very busy in 1931. He allegedly
spent a
year in Switzerland under the care of Carl Jung, and also spent time
with Courtenay Baylor in Boston,
and also spent at least the later part of the year in
New Mexico setting up and running a clay products company, making
floor and roof tile. I really
wish I could be nearly that efficient in my utilization of my time...

Another historian, Richmond Walker, wrote:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Courtenay Baylor began working with Father Worcester in 1912, focusing
solely on those with alcohol problems, and became the other key leader
in the [Emmanuel] movement in later years.
<p>
What was of special importance to A.A. was Baylor's influence on
Rowland Hazard. Hazard may in fact have consulted with the Swiss
psychiatrist Carl Jung for a short period in 1931 (although no longer
than two months at most, based on the author's study of the Hazard
family papers). But Hazard had to be hospitalized for his alcoholism
in February and March of 1932, and then from January 1933 to October
1934 was again in bad shape and unable to carry on his business activities.
If Jung had helped, it was certainly a much delayed reaction.
<p>
What seems to have been much more important is that Courtenay Baylor
became Rowland Hazard's therapist in 1933, and continued to work with
him through 1934. It is under the influence of Baylor's Emmanuel
Movement therapy that Hazard actually began to recover. Hazard was
also attending Oxford Group meetings, but his family was paying Baylor
to be his regular therapist.
<p>
In August 1934, of course, Hazard helped rescue Ebby Thacher from being
committed to the Brattleboro Asylum, and three months later, in November
1934, Ebby visited Bill Wilson in his kitchen, in the famous scene
recorded in the first chapter of the Big Book.<br>

<p>
Actually, it is very much in doubt.
Jung never confirmed any treatment of Rowland in his famous
letter to Bill Wilson. Jung ignored that point, and simply refrained from
contradicting Bill when Bill declared, in his January 1963 letter to the doctor,
that Rowland had been one of Jung's patients.
Jung carefully avoided committing himself one way or the other on that point.
Jung never said that Rowland Hazard had been one of his patients.
Neither did he say that Rowland wasn't. He only confirmed that he had talked with
Rowland at some time or other.

<p>
Jung simply thanked and praised Bill Wilson for agreeing with
his ideas of &quot;spirituality&quot;.
<p>

<i>Slaying The Dragon</i> actually says:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
A just-completed review (continuing Wally P.'s initial investigations)
into the Rowland H. papers at the Rhode Island Historical Society reveals
no evidence that Rowland was treated by Jung and suggests that, if such
treatment did occur between 1930-1934, it was for a much shorter period
(a few weeks). These same records do contain evidence that Rowland H. was
treated twice for alcoholism at Doctor's Hospital in Yorkville, New York
(February-March 1932; July, 1932) and that he was under the care of lay
therapist Courtenay Baylor (see Chapter 12) between December, 1933 and
October, 1934.<br>

In addition, the famous quote that Bill Wilson said Carl Jung spoke to Rowland
Hazard &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The only radical cure for dipsomania is religiomania&quot; &#8212;
</font>
actually came from William James in <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i> (footnote 1 on page 263):<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
'&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot;
is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical man.'<br>
</font>
William James published <i>Varieties</i> in 1902. Bill Pittman
reported that Jung and James met in
1909, so William James probably didn't get it from Carl Jung.

For your education and enlightenment, here is Carl Jung's famous letter to Bill Wilson:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Dear Mr. W.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Your letter has been very welcome indeed.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I had no news from Roland H. anymore and often wondered what has been his fate. Our
conversations which he has adequately reported to you had an aspect of which he did not
know. The reason that I could not tell him everything was that those days I had to
be exceedingly careful of what I said. I found out that I was misunderstood in every
possible way. Thus I was careful when I talked to Roland H. But what I really thought
about was the result of many experiences with men of his kind.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

His craving for alcohol was the equivalent, on a low level, of the spiritual thirst of
our being for wholeness, expressed in medieval language: the union with God.*<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
How could one formulate such an insight in a language that is not misunderstood in our
days?<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The only right and legitimate way to such an experience is that it happens to you in
reality and it can only happen to you when you walk on a path which leads you to
higher understanding. You might be led to that goal by an act of grace or through
a personal and honest contact with friends, or through a higher education of the
mind beyond the confines of mere rationalism. I see from your letter that Roland H.
has chosen the second way, which was, under the circumstances, obviously the best one.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I am strongly convinced that the evil principle prevailing in this world leads the
unrecognized spiritual need into perdition, if it is not counteracted either by a
real religious insight or by the protective wall of human community. An ordinary man,
not protected by an action from above and isolated in society, cannot resist the power
of evil, which is called very aptly the Devil. But the use of such words arouses
so many mistakes that one can only keep aloof from them as much as possible.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
These are the reasons why I could not give a full and sufficient explanation of Roland
H., but I am risking it with you because I conclude from your very decent and honest
letter that you have acquired a point of view above the misleading platitudes one
usually hears about alcoholism.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
You see, &quot;alcohol&quot; in Latin is &quot;spiritus&quot; and you use the same
word for the highest religious experience as well as for the most depraved poison.
The helpful formula therefore is: <i>spiritus contra spiritum</i>.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thanking you again for your kind letter.

<p align="right">
I remain<br>
Yours sincerely<br>
C. G. Jung

<p>
Note that Jung wrote of his conversations with Rowland as if they were interviews
with a newspaper reporter &#8212; he couldn't tell Rowland the whole truth, he said, for fear that
people would misunderstand his words. That does not sound like a doctor-patient relationship.
It would certainly be a strange kind of malpractice to withhold information or
treatment out of fear that some other people might misunderstand it.
To me, it sounds like Rowland simply
went to Jung to ask him about the treatment of alcoholism. Jung also said that Rowland
had &quot;adequately reported&quot; those &quot;conversations&quot; to Wilson.
But Wilson did not describe in detail a year of psychotherapy with Jung. He only repeated
a few ideas about needing a religious mania to break the grip of alcoholism &#8212;
the idea that <i>&quot;the only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania&quot;</i>.
What was &quot;adequately reported&quot; could have been said by Jung in a single hour.

<p>
<a name="Jung3"> </a>
Carl Jung had some very strange ideas about spirituality. He believed that<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;the evil principle prevailing in this world leads the
unrecognized spiritual need into perdition...&quot;<br></font>
and<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;An ordinary man, &nbsp; ... &nbsp; cannot resist the power
of evil, which is called very aptly the Devil.&quot;</font>
<p>
There are those familiar old fascist &quot;powerless over sin&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane">defeated by sin</a>&quot;
ideas of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a>, again.
The reason that they are fascist is because Frank Buchman would then declare that because
you are powerless over evil, and he isn't, you must let him run your life and boss
you around and dictate every detail of your life, even
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#free2think">what you will think</a>.
Jung also held &quot;rationalism&quot; in contempt, as did Buchman.
Buchman's Oxford Group declared that the rational, thinking mind was just an illusion,
a mistake that should be discarded. Buchman said, essentially, &quot;Just stop thinking,
and do whatever you are told&quot;, the same as the Nazis did.
<p>
Note how much of what Jung wrote was the kind of vague garbage that we would call
&quot;psycho-babble&quot; today (popular psychology babble):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just try to figure out, from reading that grand-sounding double-talk,
<i>just what</i> you are really supposed to do to get a spiritual experience.

<p>
<a name="collaborating"> </a>
And Carl Jung certainly
seems to have been powerless over evil. He cooperated with and praised the Nazis in the 1930s,
and declared that
he was unable to see what the rise of the &quot;archetype&quot; of Nazism represented.
He declared that he could not foresee what future the Nazis would bring to the world.
He participated
in radio broadcasts where he praised the Nazis while declaring that women and Jews had
&quot;inferior spirituality&quot;.
<p>
And while Jung began his letter by saying that he
had had to be &quot;exceedingly careful&quot; about what he said to Rowland, he had
nothing to fear from the Nazis, because Carl Jung was Swiss, and beyond their reach.
Besides, Carl Jung was collaborating with the Nazis and they loved him.
<p>
What Carl Jung really feared was people who strongly disagreed with his actual beliefs, and harshly
condemned him for such fascist and racist beliefs.
<p>
In the nineteeen-thirties,
Jung worked as the editor of the German psychology magazine <i>Zentrallblat f&uuml;r
Psychotherapie und ihre Grenzgebiete</i> (Journal for Psychotherapy and Related Disciplines),
which routinely printed Nazi propaganda and philosophy, including editorials by
Matthias Heinrich Goering, the cousin of Hermann Goering.
<font size="-1">(See: <i>Against Therapy; Emotional Tyranny
and the Myth of Psychological Healing</i>, by Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson,
pages 94-123.)</font>)

<p>
When Jung took over the editorship,
Matthias Heinrich Goering placed these instructions to writers in the magazine:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
It is expected of all members of the Society who write articles that they will have
read through with great scientific care the path-breaking book by Adolf Hitler, <i>Mein Kampf</i>,
and will recognize it as essential [to their work].<br>
</font>
<font color="black" size="-1"><i>Against Therapy; Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological Healing</i>,
Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, pages 95-96.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And Jung wrote an editorial that announced his new role as editor,
which included the statement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The differences which actually do exist between Germanic and Jewish psychology and
which have long been known to every intelligent [<i>insightful</i>] person are no
longer to be glossed over, and this can only be beneficial to science. [C.W., 10:533].<br>

The Jewish race as a whole &#8212; at least this is my experience &#8212; possesses an unconscious
which can be compared with the Aryan only with reserve.
Creative individuals apart, the average Jew is far too conscious and differentiated
to go about pregnant with the tensions of unborn futures.

The Aryan unconscious has a higher potential than the Jewish;
that is both the advantage and disadvantage of a youthfulness not yet
fully weaned from barbarism.

<!-- =============================================================== -->
. . .
The Aryan unconscious . . . contains explosive forces and seeds of a
future yet to be born. . . . The still youthful Germanic peoples are
fully capable of creating new cultural forms that still lie dormant in
the darkness of the unconscious of every individual &#8212; seeds bursting
with energy and capable of mighty expansion.

The Jew, who is something of
a nomad,
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#no_culture">has never yet
created a cultural form of his own</a> and as far as
we can see never will, since all his instincts and talents require a
more or less civilized nation to act as host for their development...

============================================================== -->

In my opinion it has been a grave error in medical psychology up till now
to apply Jewish categories &#8212; which are not even binding on all Jews &#8212;
indiscriminately to Germanic and Slavic Christendom.

Because of this most precious secret of the Germanic peoples &#8212; their creative
and intuitive depth of soul &#8212; has been explained
as a morass of banal
infantilism, while my own warning voice has for decades been suspected
of anti-Semitism. This suspicion emanated from Freud. He did not
understand the Germanic psyche any more than did his Germanic followers.
Has the formidable phenomenon of National Socialism, on which the whole
world gazes with astonished [<i>awe-struck, admiring</i>] eyes, taught them better? Where was that
unparalleled tension and energy while as yet no National Socialism
existed? Deep in the German psyche, in a pit that is anything but a
garbage-bin of unrealizable infantile wishes and unresolved family
resentments. A movement that grips a whole nation must have matured in
every individual as well.<br>

The following text is from the biography of Carl Jung by Richard Noll:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
According to Jolande Jacobi, one of his closest disciples
from the thirties on, &quot;His idea [about the Nazi movement] was that chaos
gives birth to good or to something valuable. So in the German movement
he saw a chaotic (we could say) pre-condition for the birth of a new
world.&quot; In response to a letter to him expressing her concerns about the
dangers of Nazism, Jacobi said, &quot;He answered me: 'Keep your eyes open.
You can't reject the evil because the evil is the bringer of light.' Lucifer
means light-bringer. He was convinced of this, you see. That shows that he
didn't see and didn't understand the outer world. For him this [the Nazi
movement] was an inner happening which had to be accepted as a psychological
pre-condition for rebirth.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>30</sup></font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the spring of 1936, Jung's famous essay on Wotan
appeared.<font size="-1"><sup>31</sup></font>
As
Jung often claimed later in life, it was indeed the first time he expressed
concern about the excesses of the Germans. However, at the same time, Jung
confirmed his belief that Germany was possessed by Wotan, the true God of the
German peoples, and that the only problem was that far too many
of them were unconscious of this fact. Their unconsciousness of the
reemergence of this pagan god in the twentieth century led to their &quot;possession,&quot;
he said. If only they would become conscious of their god, then the
Germans would find their way to a true spiritual rebirth. Again, Jung
simply psychologizes the political problem.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the issue of anti-Semitism, Jacobi herself presents conflicting opinions.
On the one hand, she defends Jung from such charges, citing her long friendship
with him and the innocence of his Volkish ideas about the differences between
the civilized Jews and the barbarian Germans. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
On the other hand, Jacobi admitted that his opinions were sometimes crude.
&quot;But he also said one day... 'You know, I would never like to have children
from a person who has Jewish blood.'&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>32</sup></font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the early years of the Nazi Era, Jung at times expressed himself in ways that
were consistent with anti-Semitic rhetoric, particularly when in the
presence of non-Jewish people. On his way to meet Jung for the first time in 1933,
Michael Fordham found himself in a third-class compartment with a Jewish man
who told him he was leaving Germany because of the National Socialists.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Sanserif">
When I arrived in Zurich the next day and met Jung I ... remarked about the Jew
in the carriage coming out of Germany. To my astonishment this started Jung
off and he went on and on and on. I was used to people talking like this for
personal reasons so I just listened. He talked about the Jews at top speed for,
I should think, three-quarters of an hour. What he said was very extensive
but two points stood out in my memory. One was that he made a very strong
point that Jews were different from other people and that they ought to be
dressed up in different clothes because otherwise we mistook them for people
like ourselves. I suppose he told me about their customs in the way he
might usually do on other occasions. I think this difference of the Jews from
others was the main point he made ... The second one ... was he asked
me rhetorically what I thought the Jews were doing in the desert for forty
years: eating sand? Of course they were, he said, feeding off other people's
crops until they moved on.<font size="-1"><sup>33</sup></font>

Carl Jung's racism was not restricted to Jews, either.
Jung accused the blacks of corrupting the American whites:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The causes for the [sexual] repression can be found in the specific
American Complex, namely in the living together with lower races,
especially with Negroes. Living together with barbaric races
exerts a suggestive effect on the laboriously tamed
instinct of the white race and tends to pull it
down.<font size="-1"><sup>32</sup></font><br>

You may have already seen this...
I never went to a Children's Boot
Camp but I did spend most of my teenage years &quot;in the system&quot;...
I went to a private, state-funded Partial Hospitalization program
when I was twelve-thirteen.  I still have terror dreams about
it... the kind where I wake up screaming and I am afraid to go back
to sleep.  I wish I could say I have forgotten the dreams and the
program; I haven't.  I remember both in exquisite detail.
<p> 
Does any of this look like anything unusual for a teenager? 
Anything on this list I mean?  Is it just me?  This stuff looks
like stuff ordinary American teenagers do.  One of the things they
taught me at the one good institution I went to (even it wasn't
perfect; its method of treating juvenile drug addicts was constant
A.A. meetings... I think their intentions were good &#8212; I would have a
hard time believing they weren't; I had been to a lot of really
horrible places by the time I got there and I felt qualified to
judge &#8212; but their therapy was not progressive &#8212; it was very middle of
the road) was that I was not the whole problem; that a lot of
gripes I had with my parents and family... i.e. that my family was
unduly restrictive, that my Father, however much he loved his
family, was still an anal retentive, neurotic, authoritarian
person.... that both of my parents were hopeless
workaholics.... that, despite their best efforts to prove otherwise,
my parents did not know everything... these were all very liberating
things for me to know.
<p>
I agree with everything you say, and your logic is impeccable so
far as I can tell.  The truth can be frightening... I have met many
people who &quot;blank out&quot; when I try to &quot;reason things out&quot; with them.
<p>
Oh, incidentally, I was a member of a Twelve Step group, Debtor's
Anonymous, for three years... I always felt like something was
wrong, like I was somehow lying to myself about it... I left four or
five years ago because I reached the same conclusions you did.  I
just never bothered to put them into words, other than the idea
that kept running through my head that D.A. seemed very much like
the cult I swore I would never join.
<p>
Well, I hope you are well... you can put this on your site... I
started to write &quot;you can use my name&quot;... but I am afraid you
can't... as paranoid as it seems, the psychopaths who ran the
Partial Hospitalization program are still out there and still in
this area (I run into one of them periodically &#8212; he always gives me
a hard time in the guise of friendly razzing... one of these days he
will regret it &#8212; I could make it happen, too... I am not a scared
twelve year old anymore;  I am a big guy, twenty seven years old,
who works out and plans to begin taking karate) &#8212; I don't want them
to know about the dreams... if these guys knew they were in my
dreams it would be all over for me.
<p>
I hope you are well...

&quot;Is too young in his sobriety.&quot;

Several years of being brain-washed in cult religion does not
make someone more sane, it makes them less sane.
<p> 

Ask any survivor of the Heaven's Gate Cult, the People's Temple,
Children of God, Scientology, etc.
All of those cults have the same attitude towards newcomers:<br>
&quot;They haven't been around long enough to know.&quot;<br>
&quot;They haven't chanted enough, or prayed enough, or done enough

2nd letter:
<p><pre>
&gt; Thanks for your reply.  Good job.  By the way, I have been sober in AA
&gt; for quite some time now and am not a fanatic.  Matter of fact I am
&gt; considered a full blown radical in the fellowship.  Yesterday a women
&gt; with 15 years told off the "old timers" and did not back down.  I backed
&gt; her publically at the meeting.  Most of what she was saying would fit
&gt; right in with what you believe. (and I am not THAT far off from the way
&gt; you feel either)

&gt; Couple of quick points :  Usually AA IS the last house on the
&gt; block.  If VA or Jesus freaks or SMART doesn't work then we are
&gt; still there as a LAST resort.
</pre><p> 

<font color="blue">
There is that funny idea: that treatment can &quot;work&quot;. That is one
of the biggest misconceptions in the whole &quot;recovery movement.&quot;
Treatment does not work. Even A.A. says that there is no cure
for alcoholism. All that you can do is quit drinking and stay
quit, and if you don't, then you become a vital statistic.
<p>

It amazes me how people can pay Hazelden $15,000 for a 28-day
stay where Hazelden is supposed to somehow &quot;make people quit.&quot;
But what it really means is that Hazelden is supposed to make
people want to quit &#8212; want it so intensely that they will stay
quit even after they leave Hazelden.
<p>
But why would anybody give $15,000 to Hazelden if they *didn't*
already want to quit?
<p>
So people already want to quit. So just what is Hazelden treatment
supposed to do, besides baby-sit people for 28 days, and give them
a short vacation from temptation? (Well, besides the indoctrination
into the 12 steps, etc....)
<p>
So just how is treatment, or A.A., or even <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>, supposed to
&quot;work&quot;?
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> doesn't &quot;work&quot;, either, not in the sense that you
mean. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> won't *make* you quit. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> is not a mind-control program
that even <i>could</i> make you quit.)
</font>

<p><pre>
&gt; Coming up on 2 years is more time than I wrongly assumed.
&gt; Apologies.  AA is simply a meeting place for &quot;alcoholics&quot; that aren't
&gt; drinking.  I have never done the steps and laugh at the &quot;Big Book&quot;.
&gt; I have been sober for a long time.  The old original members are dying
&gt; daily and the fellowship will change with current times.
</pre><p> 

<font color="blue">
Apologies accepted, but I still find that attitude disturbing.
You now seem to feel that my words are more valuable, or more to be
respected, because I have a couple of years of Time. That's still A.A.
dogma. My slant on reality is: If someone says, &quot;Two plus two
equals four&quot;, that will be true no matter whether the speaker
is drunk or is a life-long teetotaler.
I don't believe that the truth changes, depending on who
is speaking it, or how long the speaker has been sober.
So whatever I say should be just as true, or just as false,
no matter how much Time I have. And the same goes for you.

<p>
But lots of A.A. members do say things like,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's too early in your recovery for you to start being creative&quot;<br>
</font>
or,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You also have not been sober long enough to have a foundation
worthy of long term soberity.&quot;<br>
</font>
&#8212; Which, near as I can figure out, means that I'm not entitled to
have an opinion yet...
Maybe someday, but not yet...
That is the standard cult characteristic
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong">Newcomers
can't think right</a>.&quot;
<p>

It's interesting to hear your view of how A.A. is evolving. Alas,
I also get reports from other places that say that A.A. is going in
the other direction, and become <i>more</i> cultish and dogmatic.
I guess it could be both, different groups going in different
directions.

<p>
You know, I hear you talking about telling off the dogmatic old-timers,
and not doing the Twelve Steps, and not believing in the <i>Big Book</i>...
Has it occurred to you that maybe you are not really a member of
A.A.? You and your friends seem to be doing something other than
following the standard A.A. program.
<p>
Now I know that part of the
standard P.R. says that you can take what you want and leave the rest,
but that's more P.R. than truth.
If you can really make A.A. into <i>anything</i> that you want,
then A.A. is nothing, really. That is, some program that is all things
to all people is really nothing to nobody.
If you can really change any characteristic of the program, then there
is no program.
I wonder if you haven't really created your own program.
<p>
Do you still start every meeting by reading the 12 Steps out loud?
Why bother, if you don't believe in them and don't do them?
Why recite a pack of lies to the newcomers at the start of every meeting,
like:
<ul>
<li> &quot;If you want what we have,
then you are ready to take certain steps [The Twelve Steps].&quot;
<li> &quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed
our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not
completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men
and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with
themselves.&quot;

<li> &quot;At some of these [steps] we balked. We thought we could
find a easier, softer way. But we could not.&quot;

<li> &quot;With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to
be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of
us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result
was nil until we let go absolutely.&quot;

<li> &quot;Remember that we are dealing with alcohol &#8212; cunning,
baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us.
But there is One who has all power &#8212; that One is God.
May you find Him now!&quot;
<li> &quot;Half measures availed us nothing.&quot;
<li> &quot;Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as
a program of recovery...&quot;
<br>
(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, pages 58 and 59.)
</ul>
<p>
Why continue to read that stuff out loud to newcomers when you know it
isn't true and don't do the Steps yourself?

&gt; Hang in there dude with whatever support program you utilize.
&gt; All in all you probably got sober the same way I did and that is
&gt; by not drinking for a considerable time until the addiction fades.
&gt; You also got sober for three years at one time in your life prior to
&gt; this sobriety.  I could never accomplish that.
</pre><p> 

<font color="blue">
The truth is, I don't really use a program, not even <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>.
I go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> meetings now and then, but I don't
&quot;live the program&quot;,
or even &quot;work the program.&quot;
(There is no N-steps program to work.)
To give fair credit where credit is due, my one most important
rule (2 variations) that I really do constantly live by came from
a movie about A.A.:<br>
<center>
<font size="+2" color="#9F0000">
Just don't take that first drink, no matter what.<br>
Just don't smoke that first cigarette, no matter what.<br>
</font>
</center>
As long as I follow those two rules, I don't need any Twelve Steps,
or any program, either.
It's amazing how much trouble you can avoid if you just follow
that first rule...
<p>
I also have my own &quot;Four Steps&quot; which I think about now and
then, especially the last one:
<p>
<font size="+1">
<ul>
<li> 1. I admit that drinking and smoking has gotten to be a
real drag, and I am suffering so much that it isn't any fun any more.
<p>
<li> 2. I quit, and I'm staying quit forever.
<p>
<li> 3. Some of my friends may help me occasionally, but I'm mainly
going to count on myself.
<p>
<li> 4. Whenever I am tempted to relapse, I will think
about step one again, and remember
why I quit in the first place. I will also remember what
happened the last time I relapsed.
<p>
</ul>
</font>
<p>
I also use a slogan I learned in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>:<p>

<center>
<font size="+2" color="#9F0000">
Play the tape to the end.
</font></center>
<p>
Meaning:<br>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Don't just think about how much fun life will be for the
next couple of hours if you get drunk. Think about what it leads to,
what life will be like tomorrow and next week and next month and next
year. Remember what happened at the end of the last tape.
So just don't take that first drink.

&gt; A little advice my friend....  If you tone down your site and papers to a
&gt; mild roar where it doesnt appear that you are a AA hater FANATIC I think you
&gt; may well be on the way to changing AA for the future and in a positive
&gt; direction.  Alcoholism is a medical issue and NOT a  moral or spiritual
&gt; shortcoming.
</pre><p> 

<font color="blue">
Believe it or not, I agree totally. I am constantly going back
and toning down the rhetoric, and trying to not come across as
a fanatic. The problem is, criticizing A.A. is a lot like
criticizing the Catholic Church, or criticizing God, Country,
Mom, and Apple Pie.  It is easy to sound like a fanatic if
you say something that is true and honest,
like,<br>
<font color="#BF0000">
&quot;A.A. doesn't actually work. It doesn't keep millions sober.
All fair and honest testing that has ever been done shows it to
be ineffective, and even downright harmful, even to the point of
killing patients... A.A. is actually a cult religion.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Well, that sounds radical, because
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody">*Everybody knows*</a>
that A.A. keeps millions sober.
<li> *Everybody knows* that A.A. is a wonderful self-help organization.
<li> *Everybody knows* that A.A. has helped millions of people to
quit drinking.
<li> *Everybody knows* that A.A. is the best, most successful
quit-drinking program in the world.
<li> *Everybody knows* that A.A. members are the experts on addiction.
<li> *Everybody knows* that A.A. has a program that really works.
<li> *Everybody knows* that A.A. is your last, best hope.
</ul>
<p> 

Unfortunately, all that stuff is just as true as Hitler's Big Lie
about Jews. (Meaning: not true.)
Back in 1936 in Berlin, we would have sounded radical,
even insane, if we had publicly disputed what *Everybody knows* and
said some good things about the Jews.
Why, it would go against common sense.
<p>
The current &quot;recovery movement&quot; has the same problem.
What *Everybody knows* to be true, isn't.
What *Everybody knows* to be the best program, isn't.
And one does tend to sound like a radical when one attacks what
*Everybody knows* is a wonderful program that has saved millions...
And one <i>really</i> sounds like a radical if one says that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_treatment">Alcoholics Anonymous
kills as many people as it saves</a>, but that's what the good, unbiased,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">scientific studies reveal</a>.

<p> 
Undoubtedly, Public Relations is one of the areas
of A.A.'s greatest success. It may not keep 'em sober, but it
sure is good at making everybody else think that it's doing it.
<p> 

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<br>
That is, <b><i>they</i></b> turn their lives around.
The evidence is that their recovery is NOT caused by
AA or NA. Often, the situation is the opposite of what you are thinking:
<ol>
<li> People decide to quit drinking or doping and save their own lives.
<li> They do.
<li> People go to A.A. or N.A. to get some helpful advice.
<li> People get fed a bunch of cult religion nonsense and get fooled
into thinking that it is necessary for recovery.
<li> People waste years doing worthless cult busy-work and going to
pointless meetings.
<li> People come to their senses and go do something else with their lives.

&gt; What is the explanation for people who are not
&gt; drinking in AA for 10 or 20 years? Are they being
&gt; played as fools by a temporal god of Buchmanism?
</pre><p>

<font color="blue">
If I understand the question, I think it is, &quot;What about
the old-timers? Are they not drinking because of A.A., or
something else? Are they victims of the cult, or the bosses of
the cult?&quot;
<p>

Well, with any given individual, I really cannot say, without
really studying and psychoanalyzing the guy, and I'm not really
a psychiatrist. In general, it seems that people spontaneously
quit drinking when they get sick and tired of being sick and
tired, period. When they finally really become 100% convinced
that they just cannot play that game and win, that they cannot
even &quot;just have one&quot;, then they won't relapse any more.
<p>

Cult membership seems irrelevant. I think a lot of people stay sober
simply because they decide they prefer their new healthy lifestyle
to suffering and dying, and A.A. really doesn't have much to do
with it. (That's certainly my attitude.)
<p>
On the other hand, some people really do love cults.
Some people are in love with Alcoholics Anonymous even
without having an alcohol problem. Look at characters like
Professor George Vaillant, who never was a drinker, but he is
a hard-core true-believer cult member, and even a member of
the Board of Trustees of AAWS.
<p>
See:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a>
<p>

And
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a> was the same way. And so was
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Jack_Alexander">Jack Alexander</a>. Both of them
also became non-alcoholic members of the Board of Trustees of A.A.W.S.

<p>

It's an open question whether after 10 or 20 years, the cult
is taking advantage of the old-timers, or whether they just
like the cult and stay in because they wish to.
When you think about all of the accumulated status that they have,
you can see why they might be reluctant to give it up.
On the other hand, A.A. is always
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias">inducing phobias</a>,
saying that you will relapse
and die drunk in a gutter if you leave, and I'm sure that some
of the old-timers really believe it. So fear keeps them in.
<p>
<a name="still_believe"> </a>
And then some other old-timers say things like,
&quot;I refuse to believe that I wasted 12 years
of my life on a cult.&quot;
<p>
Carl Sagan, in his book <i>The Demon Haunted World: Science as a
Candle in the Dark</i>, told the story of how the TV program
<i>60 Minutes</i> in Australia performed a funny candid-camera kind
of experiment where they manufactured a phony guru and then
foisted him on the public for a few weeks, to see how gullible the
public was. The experiment was a great success (if you look at it that
way) because nobody, not even the press or other TV news organizations,
even bothered to check out the charlatan's
false credentials and fake credits. Everybody just swallowed it all,
hook, line, and sinker. And the most outrageous part was the fact
that, after <i>60 Minutes</i> and even the phony guru himself
explained to the public that it had all been a hoax, just a test of
gullibility, some people still said to the phony guru,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We don't care what they say about you. We still believe in you.&quot;
</font>
Some people will do just about anything to avoid admitting that they
have been fooled &#8212; even continue to be fooled. It seems like,
once you get those people committed to the hoax, you've really got them.

Hello,  

I LOVE your site.  I have been going to psychotherapy for about 1
year, due to severe depression and suicidal tendencies.  I was
physically and emotionally abused as a kid, and you're not kidding
about the guilt and lack of self-esteem that could occur if folks
like me actually worked those fucked up steps.   
<p>

Up until about 5 months ago, I used to drink a hell of a lot, too. 
Well, in early August, I got really drunk.  My therapist told me to
go to AA twice a week for two months or she would stop seeing me. 
Since I've been suicidal before, I thought that probably wasn't a
good idea, so I agreed to go.  (She really is a good therapist, is
not an alcoholic or drug addict, so not an AAer) and I have been, I
hope, teaching her a lot from sites like yours.
<p>

As soon as I went I thought is was a little creepy.  Then I started
reading your site and the AADeprogramming site and definitely saw
it was a cult.  I already had a sponsor, so I couldn't escape that
crap of sponsorhood.  I still go to AA 3 times a week (I go more
often than I am required, not to get their "program," but to remind
myself of why I have to stop drinking on my own or I will turn out
like the crazed cult members in the church basement.)  I also go to
get more evidence of just how much it is not for me, and is a cult.
 My sponsor is a total cult head.  I don't lie to him, but I sure
don't say much to him.  I don't want any personal connection to
exist between me and him &#8212; I don't want his claws in me.  I just
listen and politely nod my head.  I never "share" at meetings &#8212;
again, I want no one to know much about me, because I dont want
them knocking on my door when I leave in early October.   
<p>

Anyway, I am still reading your site.  I read it every night.  It
actually helps keep me sober by keeping in my head just how much I
don't want to be like them.  Thanks, and please keep it up.  Your
research capabilities are excellent.

Where can one have a room of people listen uninteruptedly to one's
ramblings? Where can the "dregs" of society show up and be tolerated if not
always accepted.  A little milk of human kindness why don't we?
You know the program sufficiently well to possibly identify yourself as one
who did not succeed in benefitting from AA, a bitterness perhaps explained
by your mail name-a 'Nam vet possibly? Just a stab from one who is deep in
debt to an organization that did not end my booze and drug habits but
certainly has helped to keep me sober and reasonably sane for near 8 years.
Constructive alternatives will be much better received than bitter complaint
<p>

<font color="blue">
So what is so wonderful about having a room full of people listening to someone's
ramblings?
<p>
There are lots of other social clubs which offer much of what you talk
about &#8212; like maybe the Elk's Clubs, the Rotary Clubs, the Shriners, and on and on.
But I don't write web pages criticizing them. Why not? Well, how about because they do
not leave their meetings and go to their jobs as parole officers, judges, therapists,
or counselors, and abuse the power of their offices by forcing people to join a
secret religious club.
(And their clubs aren't anonymous or secret, either.)
Using the law to force people to join your (or any) religious or
<a href="orange-spirrel.html">
so-called &quot;spiritual&quot;</a> group is illegal, immoral, and un-Constitutional.
But hidden A.A. members continue to do it every day.

<p>
In addition, the Elks, Rotaries, and Shriners do not use their clubs to
foist voodoo medicine on people as the best or only cure for a deadly illness.
They don't
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds_suicide">kill people</a> with
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
ineffective quack medicine</a>.
<font color="#BF0000">
(My idea of &quot;the milk of human kindness&quot; starts with &quot;don't kill people&quot;.)
</font>
In fact, the Shriners
are paying for the hospitalization and life-long medical treatment of a friend's child
who got horribly burned.
You will never see A.A. doing something like that for somebody, will you? Why not?
<p>
The answer to those unanswered questions is, &quot;Because A.A. is a cult religion,
not a wonderful, beneficial social club or a helpful quit-drinking program.&quot;
And that is why I feel compelled to criticize it.
<p>
You state that A.A. did not actually work to get you off of drugs or alcohol; it just
gave you some moral support. Okay. Do you realize how rare it is to hear that?
Few true believers will ever admit something like that. They recite to all of the newcomers,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path...&quot;
</font>
which is a total lie. (See the <i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)

<p>
<a name="no_benefit"> </a>
You describe me as &quot;one who did not succeed in benefitting from AA&quot;.
Excuse me, but you misunderstand the situation. I found out fairly quickly that it
was a cult, and quit going.
And even while I was going, I did not try to benefit from surrendering my mind,
my will, or my life, to a cult religion. (Step Three.)
And before you ask, &quot;Well, if you never tried to work the 12-step program, how do you
know it wouldn't help you?&quot; I must warn you that I simply answer that question
with, &quot;How do you know that Reverend Jim Jones' cyanide kool-aid is bad for
your health if you have never tried it?&quot;
<font color="#BF0000">
(Hint: Other people tried it, and we saw what happened.)
</font>
<p>

I feel like I learned a lot from going to A.A. though, and did benefit in some ways:
I learned a lot about A.A. and what it really is, and got a
refresher course in how cults work, and saw once again just how crazy people can be.

<p>
<a name="Agent_Orange"> </a>
As far as the &quot;Agent Orange&quot; name goes, it started because the woman who
runs the
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.aadeprogramming.com/">www.aadeprogramming.com</a> web site
likes to use the name &quot;Apple&quot; because she has a Macintosh computer.
Well, I prefer Sun Microsystems and Unix, so I chose the name &quot;Orange&quot;, so
that we could joke about mixing apples and oranges. (It's an old joke &#8212; computer magazines
have had articles talking about the difficulties encountered in networking Apples
and Suns called &quot;Getting Apples to Talk to Oranges&quot;.)
Then &quot;Orange&quot; morphed into &quot;Secret Agent Orange&quot;
because I chose to stay anonymous.

<p>
I am also very aware of the Vietnam allusions in the name &quot;Agent Orange&quot;.
I remember a
fair bit about that strange deadly mixture of <i>2,4-D</i> (Round-Up&reg;)
and <i>2,4,5-T</i> herbicides with its traces of Dioxin, because I worked
on the protest project in the seventies to keep the 2.75 million gallons
of surplus, left-over, Agent Orange from being dumped in the USA, which
would have poisoned a lot of people's drinking water.
<p>
Amazingly, we actually won that one.<br>
They finally burned it in a special incinerator ship out in the middle of the
Pacific, near Johnson Island.<br>
Unfortunately, that still does nothing to repair the ecology of Vietnam, which had
23.5 million gallons of that poison sprayed on it by the lunatics who brought
us the War in Vietnam. (To try to visualize a number that big, consider that it
was more than 427,000 55-gallon drums of the toxic, non-biodegradeable, poison.)
<p>
Now let's see if we can win the A.A. one, too.
<p>
Lastly, you say that I should offer something better than A.A. if I wish to criticize.
That's the common cult complaint, &quot;You can't criticize our program unless you
have a perfect program of your own to offer as an alternative.&quot;
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">That is bogus logic</a>.
If someone is selling witchcraft as a cure for AIDS, I can and should
criticize him and his potentially-fatal quack medicine,
without having to have a working cure for AIDS to offer as an alternative 
to the witchcraft.
<p>
<a name="solution4"> </a>
And there really is a good, simple, alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">Nothing. No treatment at all.</a>
The Harvard Medical school found that 80% of those alcoholics
who successfully quit for a year or more do it alone, without any
treatment program. So the cult religion and voodoo
medicine is quite unnecessary, and is in fact
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge">hurting people
by giving them a lot of false information about alcoholism</a>.
<p>
If you want a program that is better than A.A., there are lots:

Hi There...
<p>

I just finished reading your pages on the net regarding AA. I
found them very interesting and even though I may not agree with
all that you have written I do defend your right to voice your
opinions.  Some of the comparisons appear somewhat far fetched
and your anger is quite apparent. I too have made some angry
statements regarding AAHQ and their handling of legal matters but
rather than attempt to destroy AA, hearing about many views on
all aspects is quite necessary in order to make an informed
decision. AA isn't for everyone and it isn't the only path to
recovery.  Rather than being harmful to my own life, I found
following a way of life learned through my association with AA
quite rewarding. One of my favorite Bill W. quotes is that
&quot;AA is a sort of kindergarten we go through to a better way
of life and wider usefulness.&quot; AA isn't my life nor was it
meant to be.  I also found it rather amusing that you singled out
a photo of Bill taken right after Dr. Bob's funeral where he was
tired and in mourning to accompany the caption you gave to it.
While I consider myself somewhat intelligent and open-minded, I
found some of the angry diatribe more of a turn off rather than
eliciting a desire to learn more about your point of view. You
may win more people over to that view if you reduce the anger and
just state the facts as you see them. The anger and sarcasm
detract from some valid points you make.  The more points of view
expressed from differing sources help in affording those seeking
recovery to make an informed decision. Thank you for your efforts
and adding to the wealth of information out there regarding AA,
informed choice and enlightening those who are on a search, not
comfortable with the choice they have made or just seeking
information.
<p>

Mitchell K.
<p>

PS: Much of the information found on the aa public controversy
site as well as others regarding Clarence, Henrietta, etc. came
from me. You see, I am not afraid of anyone, especially AA
members from seeing the truth, perceptions of the truth, etc. in
order for them to make an informed choice.

<p>
<br>
<font color="blue">

Hello Mitchell K.,

<p>
It is good to hear from you. I've enjoyed reading your articles
on the Internet, especially the ones on
<font color="#4f007f">
<!-- a href="http://alcoholism.about.com/health/alcoholism/library/blmitch12.htm" -->about.alcoholism.com</a></font>.
<font color="#9F0000">
[Dead Link. See this local copy:
<a href="blmitch12.htm" target="_blank">blmitch12.htm</a>.]
</font><br>

You strike me as being one of the few A.A. members out there who
is actually really interested in the truth, and who will tell the truth,
loudly even, and you get a lot of respect from me for that. Thanks.

<p>
You mention that I am angry. Yes, I am. And I don't think there
is anything wrong with it. I believe that anger is a proper,
natural reaction to some things. I don't believe in Bill Wilson's
ridiculous, crippling, injunction against feeling your anger:

<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong with us.  If
somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.  But
are there no exceptions to this rule? What about 'justifiable'
anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't we entitled to be mad? Can't
we be properly angry with self-righteous folk? For us in A.A.
these are dangerous exceptions.  We have found that justified
anger ought to be left to those better qualified to handle it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

At the same time, I try to keep that anger down to a dull roar.
I am constantly going back and rewriting things, and trying to
tone down the rhetoric a little, and minimize the invective,
without losing the point.

<p>
Speaking of which, you didn't mention where you were reading my
pages. The ones on AAdeprogramming.com are very old now, and I
can't fix or update them. The new versions of everything are on:

<p>
<a href="index.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/index.html</a>

<p>

And why do I feel that anger is justified? Well, consider this:

<p>

<table border="3" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="0" width="95%">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font size="4" base="4" color="blue">

Imagine that you or your wife or some close friends came down
with cancer. When you went to the cancer clinic, you found that
it had been taken over by a faith-healing religion that believed
that the best treatment for cancer was to pray to the voodoo gods
of Legba, Damballah, and Bon Dieu, and to stick acupuncture
needles into voodoo dolls. They explained that cancer was really
a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;, and that you would recover from
cancer if you would confess all of your sins and spend your life
&quot;following the dictates of a Higher Power.&quot;
<p>
The believers in this faith-healing religion insisted that their
treatment program was fool-proof &#8212; &quot;The program never fails
anyone; it is just some patients who fail the program&quot; &#8212; in
spite of the fact that the program had a 95% dropout/failure
rate.
The extreme true believers even insisted that all new patients must
stop taking the medications that doctors prescribed, and just
trust the spirituality of the program to heal them.

When a patient died, which they almost all did, the cult
members would cluck and say, &quot;He always was such a fool. He never
did learn how to poke the needles right. He probably held some
back, too.&quot; Then they began every therapy session by chanting,
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed
our path...&quot; When a rare lucky patient went into spontaneous
remission and recovered from his cancer, the true believers all
cheered and said, &quot;See! It works! That proves it! Keep Coming
Back, It Works!&quot;

<p>
Then, the practitioners of this religion actually managed to
charge your city and state and your health insurance plan for
&quot;cancer treatment&quot; when they stuck the needles into the
dolls.

<p>
Then, you discovered that the founder of this religion was
actually a mentally-ill, felonious, lying, philandering con
artist, not a saint, and that the theology of the religion was
really the bizarre irrational ravings of a certified lunatic.

<p>
Most outrageous of all, you found that many earlier converts to
this voodoo cult religion were working as counselors, therapists, doctors,
judges, and parole officers who were abusing the power of their
offices and using any flimsy excuse they could find to force more
people to go to the clinic to learn to &quot;stop sinning, and live a
spiritual way of life.&quot; That is, to become new converts of
the voodoo religion.

<p>
If you actually found yourself or your loved ones in such a
clinic, in the care of such quack doctors, would you talk about
the need to merely &quot;reform&quot; the clinic, to eliminate
the &quot;few bad apples&quot;? Would you say that the clinic was
basically good because they prayed a lot, and that the clinic
really just needed a change in leadership?

<p>
Or would you demand that the clinic be shut down and the pushers
of that cult religion be prosecuted for criminal fraud and
manslaughter?

<p>
<a name="pic1950"> </a>
<br>

As far as
<a href="orange-not_good.html#benefits16">
that picture of Bill Wilson</a> goes, I have thought about
that a lot, and whether it is unfair to caption it so.
(By the way, another web site has it labeled as
happening after the funeral of a friend of Henrietta Seiberling,
perhaps a Helen S. or Anne S., or something. I'll have to
double-check that name, but I'm sure it wasn't Dr. Bob because I
would have remembered that. Are you sure that it was after Dr.
Bob's funeral?)

<p>
What I really wanted was a picture of Bill Wilson taken around
1950 or 1951, showing him in the middle of his 11 years of deep crippling
clinical depression, just sitting holding his head in his hands all
day long, or just laying in bed staring at the ceiling all day. The
reason I want 1950 or 1951 is:

<p>
<ol>
<li> Because by then, Bill Wilson had been living the A.A. life,
and working the Steps, for 15 or 16 years.

<p>
<li> Because that's when he was writing his second book (with the
help of <a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP">Tom P</a>.), which he
said was a book that would teach you how to be happy:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;A.A.'s Twelve Steps are a group of principles, spiritual in
their nature, which if practiced as a way of life, can expel the
obsession to drink and enable the sufferer to become happily and
usefully whole.<br>
&nbsp; ...<br>
&quot;Many people, nonalcoholics, report that as a result of the
practice of A.A.'s Twelve Steps, they have been able to meet
other difficulties in life. They think that the Twelve Steps can
mean more than sobriety for problem drinkers. They see in them a
way to happy and effective living for many, alcoholic or not.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
pages 15-16, in the Foreword.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<li> Because that's when Bill should have been exhibiting the beneficial
effects of 15 or 16 years of practicing the Twelve Steps, but wasn't.

<p>
<li> And that's when Wilson claimed that A.A. had been good for him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
But dependence upon an A.A. group or Higher Power hasn't produced
any baleful results.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 38.</font>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<p>
It was typical of Bill Wilson's &quot;spirituality&quot; and
&quot;rigorous honesty&quot; that he didn't bother to mention the
fact that he was so chronically depressed that he was under the
care of a psychiatrist (<a href="orange-Tiebout.html">Dr. Harry
Tiebout</a>), or that he was so mentally ill that he was a basket
case, completely crippled and non-functional, when he wrote those
words in 12x12.

<p>
So much for a life that is &quot;happily and usefully whole&quot;.<br>
So much for &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;. (See
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#rigorous">the <i>Big Book</i>, page 58</a>.)<br>
So much for &quot;no baleful results&quot;.<br>

<p>
It also seems typical of Bill Wilson that he would say something like<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;AA is a sort of kindergarten we go through to a better way
of life and wider usefulness.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

But Bill Wilson also wrote many, many times,
including in the quotes just above, that A.A. <i>*was*</i> a complete
&quot;way of life&quot; for both alcoholics and non-alcoholics,
and that you can't ever leave A.A., or else.

Wilson contradicted himself constantly by making statements on both
sides of many issues. Which statements should we believe he really meant?

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better
understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic
is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living
has its advantages for all.<br></font>

Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should
neglect his family. You should continue to be friendly to them.
The family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept

to drink, the family will find life more bearable.<br>

One more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions
or not, they may do well to examine the principles by which the
alcoholic member is trying to live. They can hardly fail to approve
these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails
somewhat in practicing them. Nothing will help the man who is off
on a spiritual tangent so much as the wife who adopts a sane

Hi There...
<p>

Far be it from me to tell anyone that they shouldn't feel or express anger.
If someone says they never get, or express anger, they are either lying or on
such heavy doses of medication that they couldn't tell if they were angry or
not. It wasn't meant as an attack but merely an observation. I know several
people who have been hurt by other AA members.
<p>

The original photograph had written on the back that it was taken after Dr.
Bob's funeral. I'm not sure if Bill had attended Henrietta's funeral. Either
way, I thought the look on his face was not one most AA's had ever seen as AA
tends to use more flattering photos.
<p>

I don't think I saw your writing on the deprogramming site. I believe it was
the agentorange one. 
<p>

As a student of AA history and literature I am well aware of the quotes you
use. I too have found many discrepancies in the literature and actual practice.
Deception is a human trait, especially in those who have their own agendas to
promote. Many in AA (from the newcomer to those at AA HQ and so-called long-term
members) have no clue as to what the founding members intended. Riches have
clouded the memories of those who now run the &quot;empire.&quot; 
<p>

I'm not your typical AA member - I believe in freedom of choice, informed
decisions and the right (and obligation) to disagree. Since you've read my
articles you know that I have and will continue to voice my disagreement
openly. This has made me somewhat of an outcast in some AA circles but...
who cares.
<p>

I don't really go to AA meetings anymore (maybe one a year if that). My
recovery is not contingent upon being addicted to the rooms of AA or living
out of fear that if I don't go I'll get drunk. My membership now is more of
an elder statesman and historian.
<p>

Again, I want to thank you for the service YOU are doing for the AA community
at large and for those who feel they don't have a choice or alternative. 
<p>

A fellow comrade in arms...<br>

HI, I'M HOLLEY
<br>
AND I'M A RECOVERING ADDICT, AND I WENT THRU A 12STEP, PROGRAM, AND NO IT'S
NOT THERE TO KEEP YOU CLEAN AND SOBER, BUT ONE THING FOR SURE THAT WILL
HELP YOU IN THE 12STEP, PROGRAM IS TO BUILD YOU A FOUNDATION TO STAND ON, FOR
YOU. FIRST OF ALL, GOD  OF YOUR OWN UNDERSTANDING IS YOUR ONLY HELP.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but I have to disagree. I am not an atheist, and I don't want
to minimize God, but I still have to
say that &quot;God as I understand Him&quot; is most assuredly
<i>NOT</i> my <i>ONLY</i> help.
I can also learn to depend on myself, and take care of myself.
I can also sometimes get help, advice, or moral support from friends, and
also give it to them.
</font>
<p>


SEE, DRUGS IS JUST A SYMPTOM. MOST ADDICTS PROBLEM IS, DENIAL, AND LACK OF
KNOWLEDGE, SO WHEN YOU HEAR SOMEONE SAY THAT THE 12STEP PROGRAM DON'T WORK,
THAT CAUSE IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THEM,OK.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is an over-simplification, just more of
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">the stereotype about alcoholics
or addicts</a>. There is a lot more to the minds of alcoholics
and addicts than just &quot;denial&quot; or &quot;lack of knowledge&quot;.
The use of drugs and alcohol often <i>*is*</i> a &quot;symptom&quot;
(really, a &quot;sign&quot;) of an underlying problem,
but the problem is often something like child abuse, slum environments,
poverty and hopelessness, or physical or mental illness, not the
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot; that Bill Wilson liked to harp on.
<p>

If someone says that the 12-step program didn't work for him,
the reason is probably because
<font color="#BF0000"><i>the 12-step program doesn't work</i></font>.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">
It has a failure rate that is between 95% and 100%</a>,
depending on how you like to measure and count things. Those few people who appear
to recover because of the 12 steps are really just cases of spontaneous remission
&#8212; they would have quit anyway because they were getting sick and tired of being
sick and tired.
</font>
<p>

IN MOST, 12STEP PROGRAMS YOU FINE
PEOPLE WITH EITHER, THE SAME TYPE OF ADDICTION, WITH THE SAME KIND OF
PROBLEM OR ISSUES, OR YOU WILL HEAR SOMETHING, OR SOMETHINGS INSIDE THOSE
MEETINGS THAT CAN AND WILL HIT YOU AND, OR YOUR ISSUES, OR PROBLEMS ON THE
HEAD.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now I can agree with that. Talking with other recovering alcoholics and
addicts can sometimes be
great. Sometimes, they give you really good advice.
Unfortunately, I've also gotten very bad advice
and misinformation there too, and sometimes it took years (including a long
relapse) to sort out which was which.

Dear Agent orange,
<p> 
I was convinced by my husband to attend AA meetings due to my off and on
relapses for the past 3 years. I want to add my relapses were from 4mo to 6
months apart and for that one day only, then the next day re-continuing my sobriety.  
<p> 
 
Getting to the point, I have been going to some AA meetings for about 3 weeks
now and I do feel uneasy about some of their beliefs like you said it feels
like a cult.  Like if you are sick with a cold and miss a meeting one time or
&quot;OH&quot; God forbid, two, they look at you and give you the vibes that
they think you have relapsed.  The leader asked me, &quot;are you OK&quot; I
stated I had been sick and he acted like he did not believe me and cut me off
real quick.  I thought &quot;You Jerk! You just want to hear all the
stories of alcohol, or me working those stupid 12 steps that I do not even
agree with.&quot;  I enjoy the therapy of releasing myself through talking out my
problems that alcohol created in my life, but that is it!! To me it is a free
therapy session and I throw a dollar in the plate at the end. I do believe in
God and I also believe it goes beyond that type of help to refrain from
drinking, like your article said The devil on one shoulder and the angel on
the other, right &amp; wrong  is the choice it is that simple!  You don't need
this 12 step crap to figure out the HELL you are going to place on yourself
and others if you make the wrong choice.
<p> 
 
You see I have a Life, unlike these people in these meetings. I have a husband,
I do not smoke, I am very athletic, I enjoy being at home after work and spending
quality time with my cat. I do not relate to many of these people at all and
not just because I am much  younger (29). Because I feel like I am a different
alcoholic, I have already passed a lot of the difficulties of staying sober,
the only time I have wanted a drink and relapsed was when I was going to a
social gathering (party, Christmas party) which are far and few between for
me. I am past the phase of thinking about it every day after work, or when I
get really angry or have had a bad day. I don't relate to people in the meetings
saying they spent all their money on it and got into financial trouble because
of it? I always maintained an A /B average in college held a job and knew that
if my money was tight then no drinking for me.  This whole AA seems a bit too
much for me I guess in some ways I feel above this program because I am further
ahead in my progress mentally and emotionally. I just attended a wedding last
weekend and I had The Best Time Of My Life because I did not drink, I was so
happy I could not stop smiling, when I got home and I told my husband what a
wonderful time I had I cried tears of joy and I have not felt that good about
myself in a long time. I want to feel that proud of my accomplishment everyday
that I do not drink and I do now.
<p> 
 
 
I am sorry for rambling on and on, but I really agree with every word you said
and now I don't feel so bad about my negative thoughts of aa. Thank You so much,
I hope you have a Great Day!  
<p> 

Michelle C.

Hello, Michelle,

<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments, and rambling is okay.

<p>
One thing that hit me right away was your description of relapses.
Over in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>,
they call those things &quot;lapses&quot;. A relapse is like if
you go to a friend's birthday party, and have your first and only beer after
3 years of total sobriety, and love that beer so much that you drink for
another 9 years after that,
until your doctor tells you to quit drinking or you're going to die.
(That's what happened to me.)
Now that's a relapse. A <i>lapse</i> is like you have a few at a party, or
just get drunk one night, and then you climb back onto the sobriety bandwagon.
You don't just totally lose control when you have a lapse (but some people do
when they relapse).

<p>
Now I hesitate to give advice here because I don't really know you, and I
don't know your biochemistry or your personality, or how you react to
alcohol. But what you are describing are lapses, not relapses.
<p>

And I don't agree with
the A.A. idea that if you have one drink, you lose all of your sober time, or
all of the benefits of your sober time.
I'm alive, with a functioning liver, just because of my 3 years of sobriety
a dozen years ago. My doctor was very pleasantly surprised to see the condition
my liver is actually in (okay). I have no doubts whatsoever that those 3 years saved
my life by giving my liver time to repair the damage and get ready for the
next onslaught of alcohol. If my liver had been 3 years further down the alcoholism
road, then it really would have been badly messed up (because the damage escalates,
and grows exponentially, at the end).

<p>
So, to my way of thinking, you don't just lose all of your sober time just
because you get drunk one night.
All of the time, sober or drunk, counts, and adds up over the long haul.
<p>
For another example, there is obviously an immense difference between
someone who has a habit of regularly lapsing
every fourth weekend, so he has just one month of sober time now, and someone who
has one month of sobriety because he just quit after 20 years of steady, hard, drinking.
Obviously, the second guy has accumulated a lot more damage, and is in much worse shape
now. I guess I'm just saying that simplistic stereotypes don't work.

<p>
Now please don't misunderstand me &#8212; I don't want to encourage anyone to drink.
I just think that you don't need to beat up on yourself and think that
you are losing everything because you lapse now and then.
It doesn't sound all that bad to me.
Since you are 29 years old, you don't sound like you are a candidate for
cirrhosis of the liver or Wernicke Korsakoff Syndrome just yet.
<p>
<a name="solution5"> </a>
But do watch out. Alcoholism does tend to be progressive. What was just a minor
problem can grow into a total disaster 20 years later.
And much of the damage, especially to the brain, is irreversible.
(Just one single drunken binge can kill 100,000 brain cells. That, in and of itself,
isn't so bad, because you have billions of them. But after 20 years, you start to
run out of brain cells and you start to have serious memory loss problems, among
other things.)
And you can't get the wasted years back, either.
<p>
If you are seeing signs
of alcoholism now, then quitting and staying quit is by far and away the safest
bet. And it sounds like that is what you are doing.
<p>
It would have saved me from a lot of grief if I had done that a long time ago.
How I wish I had been smart enough
to heed the warning signs in the beginning, and quit and stay quit early in the
game.<br>
But I thought I was different from
my father, and that it would never get me like it got him... (Famous Last Words.)<br>

I didn't think I was a real alcoholic because it wasn't that bad (yet).
(That's more Famous Last Words.)<br>

I thought that because I could quit and stay quit for three years that I had it
under control, and could drink a little. (Wrong. It's just like the old Lays potato
chip commercials: &quot;I bet you can't eat just one.&quot;
<font color="#BF0000">
But that's my personal problem, and it doesn't sound like it is yours.
People are different; stereotypes don't work.</font>)

<p>
And your addictive mind will play games on your head and rationalize a lot of
things, and tell you that you can drink, that it's okay to drink, because you
can handle it, and quit whenever you want, etc... It sounds like you already
saw the web page on
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">the Addiction Monster</a>, with the angelic Donald Duck
on one shoulder,
and the devil Donald on the other, whispering,
<font color="green">
&quot;Drink! Smoke! It will be fun!&quot;</font>
Recognizing that situation, and being aware of what's going on
has been a very big part of the victory for me. Staying
quit is tough when that fool little lizard brain keeps whispering in your ear
that you can smoke and drink after all...
<font color="green">
(<i>&quot;It'll be okay because you're
strong, and you have it under control...&quot;</i>)
</font>
But understanding what it is doing has been a life-saver for me.

<p>
I agree with your statement about being &quot;a different kind of alcoholic&quot;.
Stereotypes don't work. I'm also different, in another way. The following two
letters came the same day as yours, and in the second one, Ken H. accuses
me of not even being a real alcoholic because I was able to quit without A.A.
and doing the 12 steps. (I wish, oh how I wish I weren't an alcoholic...)
It's a stupid stereotype to say that all alcoholics are totally out of control
and can only live if they make A.A. their whole life. That's a cult all right.

<p>
One of the ways that I am &quot;a non-standard alcoholic&quot; (in A.A. terms)
is that I can quit and stay quit for years at a time
(when I finally get it together to really do it).
A.A. keeps saying that is impossible, because you are &quot;powerless
over alcohol.&quot; 
Well I'm not powerless, but yes, I am a real alcoholic. And obviously, I am also
not &quot;in denial&quot;, either, like the stereotype says I should be.

<p>
My doctor explained it far better than A.A. ever did. He said that alcoholics
can have great control over their sobriety &#8212; they can stay sober for years at
a time. They just don't have any control over their drinking &#8212; their drinking
will spin out of control very rapidly. That explained a lot for me, because I
knew I wasn't &quot;powerless&quot;. I just go nonlinear and want to drink myself
into Heaven after I get several beers in me.

<p>
Oh, and while I'm really not on a campaign to sell the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> program to everybody,
I would suggest that going to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> might be a good compromise that would
make your husband happy.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> is pretty easy-going, and even gives good information, rather than cult
dogma. You will meet lots of refugees from A.A. there &#8212; other people who also
couldn't stomache A.A.. And if you don't find a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> meeting around, you could also
check out WFS (Women For Sobriety) or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a> (Secular Organizations for Sobriety).
But <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a> seems to be the most common and wide-spread right now.
<p>
The SMART web site is:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160826160011/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.smartrecovery.org/</a>
<p>
You can find meeting schedules, or a phone number to get a schedule, there.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.
