Subject:  	sponsoring<br>

<p>
I was thinking recently about the idea of sponsorship
promoting the belief that the more time sober you have, the smarter you
are... and able to think ( not for yourself )... but for a newcomer in the
program. First, you need to be monitored and have someone teach you how
to live your life, then you teach someone else how to live there's and
monitor them. Meanwhile your individuality is lost. I get the feeling
they do this on purpose.
<p>
thanks orange...<br>
I hope you're getting these letters

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Ted,
<p>
Yes, I'm getting the letters.

<p>
Yes, isn't it funny how an A.A. member declares the he cannot think properly,
and he depends on his sponsor to think for him and tell him how to live.
And then he turns around and sponsors a newcomer and tells that newcomer how to live
(because
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="newwin43">
the newcomer can't think for himself</a>).

<p>
It creates a pyramid of mental incompetents who all insist that they cannot think
straight and they depend on the guy above them to do their thinking for them.
(And of course it's also a pyramid of obedience.  It keeps everybody in line.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;My thinking is all screwed up, and I can't manage my own life,
but my sponsor is clear-headed
and qualified to run my life for me, in spite of the fact that he recites
the same speech and says that <i>his</i> thinking is fucked, but
his sponsor is really clear-headed, in spite of the fact that his sponsor
<i>also</i> gives the same speech, and says that his thinking is also
really fucked, but <i>his</i> sponsor...&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So who is at the top of the pyramid? Who finally stands up and declares,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;I am a paragon of sanity and clear thinking,
and I will do the thinking for all of you brain-damaged underlings!&quot;</font>?
<p>
I never saw that guy, or even heard of him... I guess he must be dead,
maybe somebody like
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#bet_your_ass" target="newwin00">Dr. Bob</a>,
who died of cancer long ago, and all that remains now
is a bunch of mentally-incompetent sponsees who all proclaim that their
brains are toast.
<p>
And yes, it is hard to maintain your individuality when you don't believe
that you have any sane thoughts or ideas of your own. What mind do you have 
that you can trust?
<p>
That brings up several standard cult characteristics:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong" target="newwin46">2. You are always wrong.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="newwin47">33. Newcomers can't think right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_trust_mind" target="newwin48">67. Don't Trust Your Own Mind.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_decision_making" target="newwin49">69. The cult takes over the individual's decision-making process.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_fix_newcomers" target="newwin50">90. Newcomers Need Fixing.</a>

Subject:  	Powerless<br>

<p>
Thank you for all you do.  I like the name Orange, how did you pick it?
I sometimes call myself &quot;The remains&quot;  as in &quot;after the
crash the remains were taken to ...&quot; 
Only partially funny because on 9.17.1967 I was very critically injured in a
motorcycle crash (it was not an accident because I was drunk and stoned at the
time).
<p>
I have been sober and clean since 10.27.1980.  I have needed  the fellowship
of AA but I only take the first step which does not use the word GOD.  I was told if
you cannot do a step to go back to the last step, so I keep backing up to step 1
which works for me.  They told me it was insane to drink when I knew what would
happen.  I say it was not insanity but alcoholism that made me drink.  I did not
need to be restored to sanity &#8212; I needed to overcome the compulsion,  which I did with
the help of a rehab on Long Island, NY.  AA members continually say they are
powerless over alcohol when the first step says we were powerless over
alcohol.  When I was drunk I was powerless but I am not powerless now.
<p>
I also say I
will never drink again to which they say why go to AA meetings   I refer them to the
Big Book chapter called &quot;Doctor Bob's Nightmare&quot;
which lists Dr. Bob's answer.  It
is my duty as an alcoholic to attend AA meetings.  It is a debt I owe to those who
were here before me.  It can be a pleasure.  It is insurance against a relapse.  I
agree with those statements.  Before the compulsion left me I needed  the fellowship
of meetings.  I do on occasion find it entertaining, though I usually keep it to
myself and I do need to keep in mind that I can never drink because alcohol is in
the bars-lined streets of my life.  I have found the NA meetings in Suffolk County,
New York to be more focused on recovery which is refreshing.  I am tired of AA
members saying it is not possible to recover immediately after reciting the preamble
which says &quot;help other alcoholics to recover from alcoholism&quot;        
<p>
Thank you for all you do.   Peace and Love.

Hi Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
I am glad to hear that you are doing well and thinking for yourself.
<p>
I chose the name &quot;Orange&quot; because a woman who ran a web site 9 years ago
used the name &quot;Apple&quot;, which led to a joke about mixing apples and oranges.
The web site was &quot;A.A. Deprogramming&quot;, where I first posted some of my articles.
There is more of the story
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Agent_Orange" target="newwin29">here</a>.
And that web site is currently mirrored here:<br>

<p>
It is good that you are acting as a member of the
&quot;<a href="orange-letters30.html#Rescue_League" target="newwin31">Newcomer Rescue League</a>&quot;, and I wish you luck. I wonder, though,
whether continued exposure to a lot of incorrect ideas about alcoholism
and recovery will eventually get to you.
<p>
I already see some A.A. dogma creeping into your thinking, like:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;It is my duty as an alcoholic to attend AA meetings.&quot;
</font><br>
Why isn't it your duty to attend SMART meetings, or SOS, or Lifering,
or anything else that teaches more sane, common-sense ideas?
<p>
While you may have derived some moral support and comfort from the fellowship of
other alcoholics while you quit drinking, you do not owe them your life, nor are
they due the credit for your sobriety.
As you have already said, you did it &#8212; you did the quitting yourself,
thus proving that you are not powerless over alcohol. So why even appear to be
giving support and credence to such misinformation?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Craig D.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Wow<br>

<p>
Hey Orange,

<p>
I want to say thanks for the website. I've been sober for roughly 9 months now.
Originally I attended AA, but never felt quite accepted, and felt things were a
little off. Like many drunks, I was an emotional wreck, and extremely confused about
where life was leading. I initially hoped that AA would help clear things, but to be
honest, it just contributed to my anxiety. While many of the suppositions on your
site I don't fully agree with, there are many similiar thoughts you express that I
myself have had.

<p>
 &#8212; God granted human beings domain over animals, but I am supposed to be powerless
over alcohol? Give me a break. Beer has never staged a home invasion. I either
bought beer or I didn't. I either went to the bar or I didn't. I am one of those
people who, once I start drinking, I don't stop. (I refuse to say can't, that seems
to be shirking responsibility to me.) The only times I stopped was due to: a) I was
out of beer; b) I was out of money; c) I passed out; d)the bar closed and I had no
where to go get some beer. My power over alcohol is not drinking it.

<p>
 &#8212; I do consider myself a fairly intelligent person. I like to ask questions to learn
stuff. Not in a kiss ass way, but I like to learn. (I read that you like the history
of the Pre-WWII fascist movements, we could probably have some interesting
discussions.) I quickly realized that any questioning in AA was frowned upon, or at
the very least answered with one of their countless cliches (which always drove me
nuts!!!).

<p>
 &#8212; I am a Catholic. I believe God can do all sorts of things. I do not, however,
believe that God really likes it when people sit around praying for a miracle while
they do nothing to help themselves. I also do not believe that I am being punished
with alcohol for my sins anymore than I believe New Orleans was smashed by Katrina
for being a sinful city. I pray daily for God's help in staying sober, but the
responsibilty starts with me. I received a lot of negative attention at AA meetings
for this &quot;crazy&quot; idea.

<p>
 &#8212; I come from a family of alcoholics. In recent family history, from my grandfather
to me, a number of family members had problems drinking. I can happily say that all
prior to me reached a point where they just quit. On their own. When I bring this up
to the AA people who tell me their way is the only way, I am given a lot of rubbish
and non-answers, or the crap about how they aren't actually in recovery.

<p>
 &#8212; Quite frankly, when I started reading your site, it scared the shit out of me. I
know this was not your intent, it's just when you read the statistics on alcoholics
it's hard not to be. But it is also encouraging because you also show examples of
people who have survived alcoholism and also that I was not a crazy lunatic for
thinking AA was off-kilter.

<p>
Due to your website, I am now exploring the AA alternatives I found in your links
section. I also am trying to arrange some sort of psychiatric treatment, since I
feel my problems run deeper than just drinking. I am now trying to open myself up to
the idea of medication, which I have always been leery of. Not because I think I'm
Tom Cruise or because of AA, just past experiences I've had with them. However, I
agree that the old school AA philosophy on medication is just stupid, and harmful.

<p>
My thoughts are that I am dealing with a potentially deadly condition, and I should
explore many different avenues of dealing with/ treating this condition. When one
first decides to sober up, he is invariably directed towards AA. Word needs to get
out about the other programs that have been proven effective or ones that show
promise, not just shuttled off to the one that gets the most attention.

<p>
Thanks again,

<p>
Craig D.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Craig,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You make a lot of sense. It sounds like you are on the
right track.
<p>
About the medications, I agree with you. If they help, wonderful. If they
just mess up your mind, then avoid them, or get something different.
It seems to depend on <i>which</i> medication someone is taking.
From what I hear, some psychiatric medications are terrible, and some are great.
It all depends on the drug and the person.
<p>
Telling people who need medications not to take their medications is just as
stupid as telling people who have raging infections not to take penicillin or
any other antibiotics because the speaker doesn't believe in them.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

This gosling is hot. You can tell by the way it is letting

Subject:  	Al-Anon?<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I stumbled on to your website today. Very interesting stuff. I've been attending
Al-Anon meetings for the last year or so as way to find some emotional support to
cope with my wifes alcoholism and mental health problems and my own feelings of
being isolated and alone. Given your views on AA, I am curious if you have an
opinion on Al-Anon?  I consider myself a &quot;skeptic&quot; who believes in the application
of reason and the scientific method to inform my world view. I grant that Al-Anon
can be a bit hokey, but there seems to be a lot of love and support in the groups
and I don't see any evidence of abuse going on. As a skeptic, I find it comforting
that they emphasize &quot;take what you like and leave the rest&quot;. This allows me to reap
the benefits of Al-Anon (emotional &quot;tools&quot; and sense of family/community) without
having to accept ideas which are at odds with my rational view of the world.

<p>
Anyway, I'd love to know your thoughts on this subject.

<p>
Regards,

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michael,
<p>
Personally, I've received some pretty dogmatic and
<a href="orange-letters90.html#agent_green" target="newwin77">wacked-out emails</a>
from Alanon members. What they lack in addiction they make up for in conviction.
That's where the religious fanatics without a drinking problem go.
<p>
Now if you have found a group that really gives you some emotional comfort,
and you are okay with the irrational dogma, then okay, enjoy.
<p>
I would just be very wary. When someone goes to 12-Step meetings month after month,
year after year, it is very hard to keep some of the bad ideas from
slowly soaking into his mind, almost absorbed by osmosis &#8212; like the idea
that your significant other is drinking and doping because of your
unspiritual behavior, and that the answer is to surrender and confess your sins.
<p>
I wrote much more about Alanon and Ala-Teen in the file on

Probably the best decision I made at that point.  In a new town, I
attended an NA meeting.
I was apprehensive of course, knowing full well that some meetings were
populated by local pushers on the lookout for clients.

<p>
I didn't know what to expect, but it seemed to me another positive move.

<p>
The meeting had a very strict agenda.  I could also feel palpable pain in the room.
We were asked, one by one, as it went around the room to introduce ourselves and
then confess to being an addict.  I choked on those words because through my own
endeavour I had not been using cocaine for several months, after the downfall of my
marriage.

<p>
It was then expected of me, after listening to similar tales of mine to tell my
story.  I saw no point in that and brought up that I was new in town a skilled
carpenter and cabinet maker and was actually there to network.  And to see if anyone
knew of some work available.

<p>
This was met with curious looks.  Almost a disappointment that another juicy story
of abuse, degradation, and failure was not going to heard.

<p>
So I explained that what I thought we should be doing was not recanting the past but
helping to support each other in our endeavours for tomorrow and the future.   It
met with even more curious looks.

<p>
I went to one more meeting and found I was more discouraged and depressed afterwards
than I was before.

<p>
My attitude towards that has not changed.  I'm not sure of the theory behind NA or
for that matter AA.  But I am convinced by own experience telling people, and
reminding them once or twice a week sometimes, that they are totally helpless in
their substance abuse, will most definitely fall back into it, and actually
that they are total losers, does not lend itself to recovery from addiction.

<p>
It is a money-making venture suppported I would imagine by the courts in some
cases.  Although I am sure it has helped some people I am afraid they are off in the
wrong direction.

<p>
Whether it is a cult or not:
<ol>
<p>
<li>
It does not empower people.

<p>
<li>
It does not give them the skills and/or the courage to take control of their lives
once more.

<p>
<li>
It is much like Catholics going to confession.  But a brief confession does not get
rid of an addiction.

<p>
Self-worth does.

<p>
And from my brief encounter NA does not fulfill that.
</ol>

<p>
Thank you for opening up this dialogue.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Allan C.

Hi
I have been reading your paper and find then very interesting,  I first went to AA
for 18 months but then drank again, so this time I just abstained by myself and for
12 years now, however recently I have felt lonely and vunerable and have started
going to one meeting a week, in a different area, I have to confess it feels
different this time and no-one seems to be so demanding or cultish, not sure if I am
going to stay, but  despite my not attending for 12 years, they have made me  feel
welcome,  I feel I have found some nice people to share my journey .....time will
tell,

Hi Alan,

I wish you success. It isn't the end of the world if you find some
companionship at some A.A. meetings. Maybe you can even inject a note
of sanity into the proceedings. You could even become a member of

Date:  	Tue, August 4, 2009 12:39 pm<br>

<p>
Hello!

<p>
First, let me out myself.  I've been sober in AA for 24 years and bounced
around it for 10 before that (with a period of 6 years sober back then).  I
sobered up in Akron, knew many of the folks that Dr. Bob 'sponsored', met
Lois, and have done quite a bit of study about the 'early years'.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sly,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on keeping yourself sober for 24 years.
</font>
<p>
Your website information is quite well researched and it's one that I'd
recommend to folks with a bit of sobriety under their belts.  There's
obviously an agenda on your part which has led you to some faulty reasoning
and quite a few 'half-truths'.  I don't have the time or the engery to take
you one point by point, but I'll try to address a few of the things that
jumped out at me with a quick cursory reading of your site.

<p>
First let me say that it seems that you must have run into the kind of AA
members that I abhor.... the fundamentalist non-thinkers.  There were quite
a few of them back in Akron when I was first trying to get sober.  They do
seem to be the most noticed and most vocal to new people coming in for
help.  It's one of the reasons for the tradition about 'principles before
personalities'.  There are a number of 'sick' people in AA and many have not
recovered emotionally even though they may have stayed 'dry' for a number of
years.  Often they're the ones who are still going to many meetings a week
in order to fend off their 'demons' (figurative NOT literal, lest you jump
on my terminology).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I got my ideas about the fundamentalist non-thinkers from reading
official A.A. council-approved literature, like the <i>Big Book</i>
and Bill Wilson's other writings like <i>As Bill Sees It</i>.
<p>
And yes, the Akron crowd was some hard-core fundamentalist
 religious types. Even Bill Wilson
said so.  And the leading dogmatic condescending non-thinker
was Doctor Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Holbrook Smith,
who wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you think you are an atheist, an agnostic, a skeptic, or have
any other form of intellectual pride which keeps you from accepting
what is in this book, I feel sorry for you.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, Dr. Robert Smith, <i>Doctor Bob's Story</i>, Page 181.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I agree that many of the sickest people become addicted to A.A. meetings
and become the resident old-timers.
</font>
<p>
I've got to get back to work, so I'll make this quick.

<p>
I looked at the section on AA being a 'cult'.  Your reasoning was compelling
but flawed.  In one sentence you mention how members must agree completely
with the founders then go on to quote numerous members who disparaged their
behavior.  Which is it?  You know that Bill took great pains to point out
that 'we are not Saints'.  Just because some newly sober or ignorant people
believe something doesn't make that the norm.  The mis-quoted Spencer quote
that you mention was given to me in its original meaning.  It's why I'm
giving your site some time, seeing what I can learn.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't know which &quot;one sentence&quot; you are referring to,
 that is then followed
by some members disparaging &quot;their behavior&quot;.
 I wish you were more specific &#8212; please quote the lines &#8212;
so that I know exactly what you are talking about. But to proceed in
general terms:
<p>
Actually, it is your logic that is flawed. A cult leader may demand
obedience, conformity in thinking, and unquestioning belief, but that doesn't
mean that he is always going to get it. On the contrary, there will always
be people who see through his scams, shams, and deceit, and criticize him
for it.
(When people did that to Bill Wilson, he hit the roof and threw a screaming
temper tantrum. In his own words, &quot;loud shouting matches ensued.&quot;)
<p>
When you claim that &quot;some people&quot; do something and
 &quot;it isn't the norm&quot;, you
are edging towards the defense that A.A. is not responsible for what the
A.A. members do, and &quot;it isn't the norm&quot; &#8212;
&quot;not all groups do it.&quot;
<p>
That is a common defense of A.A., and it is wrong. A.A. is what its members
make it. If a newcomer girl is sexually exploited by the resident sexual
predator (like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin04">Mike Q. and his gang</a>),
then that is &quot;the real A.A.&quot; for her.
That is "the real A.A. experience."

It doesn't matter whether it is &quot;the norm&quot;,
or whether &quot;all groups do it&quot;.
In her experience, A.A. is a very bad organization.
<p>
Likewise, when sick people get bad advice and goofy cult religion as &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;a cure&quot; for alcoholism, then that is their A.A. experience.  It doesn't
help them any that some other lucky people got better advice over in
another state.

<p>
Bill Wilson's line about &quot;we are not Saints&quot; is routinely
used to rationalize and minimize all kinds of bad behavior. It's one
of the more disgusting aspects of Alcoholics Anonymous.
 Pretend to be spiritual, and then do reprehensible
things, and then rationalize, &quot;We are not saints...&quot;
</font>
<p>
You like to talk about AA as some kind of institution.  It isn't.  You
mention how AA disparages other treatment options... I'd like you to show me
ONE piece of actual AA liturature that does that, not just the opinion of
some of it's members...and then you quite rightly mention that AA has no
opinion on outside issues.  Which is it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Bill Wilson pulled a
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">bait-and-switch trick</a>
there.
First, he put on the appearance of being moderate
 by making a few mollifying open-minded-sounding remarks
like &quot;we have no monopoly&quot;, and
&quot;we know only a little&quot;, and then he
wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Any willing newcomer feels sure A.A. is the only safe harbor for the
foundering vessel he has become.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson,
 page 35.</font>

<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual
experience will conquer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To one who feels he is an
atheist or agnostic such an experience seems impossible, but to
continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an
alcoholic of the hopeless variety. To be doomed to an alcoholic
death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy
alternatives to face.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But it isn't so difficult. About half our original fellowship were
of exactly that type [atheists or agnostics].
At first some of us tried to avoid the issue,
hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after a
while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual basis
of life &#8212; or else. Perhaps it is going to be that way with you.
But cheer up. Something like half of us thought we were
atheists or agnostics. Our experience shows that you need not
be disconcerted.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

<p>
And the <i>Big Book</i> also says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...he was insisting that he had found the only cure.<br>

...they had found the only remedy...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 259.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
</font>

<p>
The only requirement is a desire to stop drinking.  PERIOD.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That simply isn't true at all. There are many requirements, even if the double-talk
says that they are not requirements (just &quot;suggestions&quot;):
<p>
<ol>
<li> Do not criticize &quot;The Program&quot;.

<li> Do not tell the truth about Bill Wilson or the history of A.A. while &quot;sharing&quot;.

<li> Believe in the Twelve Steps.

<li> Go to meetings, get a sponsor, and Work The Steps.

<li> Recruit new members, and then train them.

<li> Revere Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob.
<li> Believe in &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
</ol>
<p>
And I know that you are going to reply that some atheist A.A. members do not
believe in &quot;Higher Power&quot;. Sure, you have your &quot;token Negros&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Yes, there's some peer pressure to find A higher power.  I lean towards
Jung's collective unconcious.  I often qualify the 'God' statement with &quot;God
as I don't understand, Him, Her, or It&quot;.  I've never had a problem
mentioning that at a meeting.  I know a handful of people who don't believe
in any kind of higher power other than the power of the group and
friendship.  They're not derided.  They have as much say as anyone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
...Like I just said, pressure to believe. Never mind the fact that an atheist trying
to work the 12 Steps is completely illogical, because there is nobody there
to deliver
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="newwin07">miracles on demand</a>
when you pray for the goodies.
</font>
<p>
If someone wants to drink or do drugs, it's their decision.  AA is there for
the folks who want to stop.  PERIOD.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a platitude.  Actually, for other people, the experience was that
A.A. is there to mislead, misinform, indoctrinate, exploit, rip off, and rape.
</font>
<p>
I've been quite uncomfortable with the courts and hospitals requiring folks
to come to AA.  It makes your opinions of AA seem more real...but again, AA
has no opinion on that... if they send folks, it's up to the individual
groups to decide if they'll sign the papers.  Most do as a courtesy.  There
are a few immature folks who go on a power trip about it.  They're NOT what
most aspire to.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That &quot;A.A. has no opinion&quot; line is really something else. Talk about dodging
the issues.  Another correspondent wrote to me and said
that when the A.A. headquarters says that it has no opinion on an issue,
what that really means is that it is a dangerous issue that the A.A. leaders
wish to avoid talking about, so they pretend to have no opinion and try to
avoid the issue.

<p>
Like how A.A. has &quot;no opinion&quot; on Mike Q.'s Midtown Group
(and other groups, like
&quot;<a href="orange-letters127.html#Pacific" target="newwin03">The Pacific Group</a>&quot;)
sexually exploiting and even raping underage girls.
&quot;Every group is independent&quot; they say, so they do nothing.
Yes, that is really &quot;spiritual&quot; behavior all right.

<!----
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Pacific">
------>

</font>
<p>
Lunch break is over, and I've got to get back to work...so I'll leave it at
that right now.  Like I was taught, the traditions are to save us from
ourselves.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but
<a href="orange-traditions.html" target="newwin05">The Traditions</a>
are just window dressing. They were never real,
and never followed.  Traditions are things that people have been doing
for a long time, like long-respected customs.
 Bill Wilson's &quot;traditions&quot; are just 12 rules that he
made up one day, rules that he didn't even bother to follow himself. Worse yet,
they embody some really bad cult dogma, like that the A.A. group is more
important than the people &#8212;
 &quot;Principles before personalities&quot;, which you quoted earlier,
 means that their cult practices are more important than your own moral
and intellectual standards,
and &quot;A.A. unity&quot; means that you have to conform to the group.
Those are not traditions &#8212; they are cult demands.
</font>
<p>
I hope you're well and happy.  If so, wonderful!  You don't have to hate
AA.  Go ahead and hate some of the folks in it, if you like.

<p>
Peace.

<p>
Sly

<p>
<font color="blue">
I am well and happy, thank you, and I hope you are too.
<p>
Sly, the only people that I &quot;hate&quot; at A.A. are those who
deliberately do grievous harm
to others who are seeking help for a terrible sickness.  That is just heartless
and beneath contempt, but unfortunately, there are a lot of such monsters in A.A.
<p>
Again, I get the feeling that your line about &quot;hate some people
in A.A., but don't hate A.A.&quot;, is another attempt to deflect
criticism, as if the A.A. organization itself does not deserve criticism
and contempt, &quot;it's just a few bad apples.&quot;
Sorry, but the whole organization has become a big negative influence
&#8212;doing more harm than good.
Overall, A.A. still fails to sober up the alcoholics &#8212; it just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin06">raises the death rate</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin07">raises the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin08">raises the rate of
rearrests</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin09">raises the costs of hospitalization</a>
of alcoholics...  That isn't good.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You are obviously living in a dream world that
has little connection to reality. What Bill Wilson wanted was to be the
leader of a cult religion that supported him in comfort, and supplied
him with money, fame, a large crowd of admirers,
and a stream of women.  Alcoholics Anonymous is not
&quot;a new medical view&quot;. It is
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin10">a repackaged old cult religion</a>.

<p>
We have seen how the &quot;A.A. code of love and tolerance&quot; works in many
groups:
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin04">
sexual exploitation</a>,
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html#manipulation" target="newwin08">
economic exploitation</a>,
<a href="orange-letters127.html#Pacific" target="newwin03">virtual slavery</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters135.html#Sarah" target="newwin09">
dogmatic demands for belief</a>.
And then there are the cultish demands that you stop thinking for yourself,
which you yourself just parrotted:
<font color="black"><i>&quot;Utilize, Don't Analyze.&quot;</i></font>

<p>
You asked, <font color="black">&quot;what is the code of the Orange pages?&quot;</font><br>
It is simple: <b>Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
because people are dying over this stuff.</b>
Didn't Jesus say, &quot;Learn the truth, and the truth shall set you free&quot;?
I really wish Alcoholics Anonymous would also start telling the truth.

<p>
There is little similarity between the A.A. slogans about spirituality
and the sad organization that really exists in cities around the world.
<p>
And the worst part of it all is that the A.A. headquarters refuses to fix any of it.
That isn't spirituality, or morality, or even common decency.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Orange &#8212; Thanks again for your reply.  I can see that you mis-read my
note of July 22.  You see , it is not an &quot;assumption&quot; that the steps
released my inner potential but a fact of my experience.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Eric,
<p>
No, I did not mis-read your last letter. It is an assumption that you got a
spiritual experience from doing some of the practices of an old cult religion.
There is zero evidence that practicing Buchmanism gives
&quot;spiritual experiences&quot;.
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="newwin11">The historical record</a>
says just the opposite.
</font>
<p>
This
experience did in fact &quot;connect[ed] me[you] up with God&quot;.  Yes I do
believe that the 12 steps have done great things for me because they
have &#8212; again a fact of my experience.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Your belief is not evidence. If fervent belief were really evidence,
then there are a lot of people in psychiatric hospitals who really are
Jesus Christ or Napoleon.
</font>
<p>

It seems that you want to
attribute my experience as some sort of coincidence of timing.  And yes
I do tell people to try take the 12 steps and see for themselves what
their own experience is.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are assuming that the mind-bending practices of an old cult religion
do good things, rather than deceive people.
The mind-altering practices of cult religions are designed to deceive people,
and induce artificial experiences,
and they are often very effective. They are techniques that have been
refined over many centuries by trial and error. The most effective
techniques survive to be improved upon by the next generation of cults.
No one cult invented them; each cult builds on what came before.
<p>
Bill Wilson got it all from Frank Buchman and his Oxford Groups.
Dr. Frank Buchman drew upon practices that
he learned from his mentor Henry B. Wright of Yale University, who learned
it from Robert E. Speer, who got it from Henry Drummond...
<p>
The fact that you quit drinking and then practiced Buchmanism is not just a
coincidence. You were so desperate to save your own life that you were
open to suggestions and willing to try whatever the cult recruiters suggested.
They told you to practice Buchmanism, so you practiced Buchmanism, and
the next thing you knew, those techniques worked on your mind and you
started believing that you were getting spiritual experiences.
If you had gone to Scientology, the sequence of events would have been similar.

<p>
My observation is that most people are simply
unwilling to take the steps.  I know many people like the woman you
mention who wrote to you who just simply have never taken the steps and
at the same time conclude they don't work.  That's not very scientific
is it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Most people are simply unwilling to take the steps&quot;
because they clearly see that that the 12 Steps are cult religion,
and they want no part of it.
<p>
What is scientific is to look at all of the people who have done the 12 Steps,
or practiced Buchmanism,
and see what happened to them. And what happened is that they had
a lot of bad experiences, and often became depressed and relapsed,
and even had mental breakdowns,
and also often got their lives so messed up that it broke up their
families, and they got divorced, and some even committed suicide.
Many others became obsessed with cult religion and made it their lives.
</font>
<p>
Also, I did not say in any way &quot;  that I [you] became powerful and able
to conquer my [your] obsession&quot;  I am afraid you again mis-read my
letter.  What I did say in my second letter was that &quot; a great inner
resource exists and *this* is what solved my problem&quot; [emphasis added].

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I did not mis-read. You are engaging in double-talk. If you have an inner
power that enables you to conquer an addiction, then that does make you
more powerful. But you are trying to fudge in the declaration that your
inner power is Somebody Else and that you didn't get any power over your
addiction.
</font>
<p>
And yes, I was clearly insane to keep drinking the way I did &#8212; a sane
man would have quit long before.  So in step 3 I decided to turn to an
&quot;unsuspected inner resource&quot; for help to solve my problem.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are still trying to fudge that &quot;inner power&quot; into being
something other than yourself, so that you can later call it &quot;God&quot;.
</font>
<p>
In steps 4
through 7 I did find that I was driven by fear &#8212; a self-centered fear
(is there really any other kind?) &#8212; and that &quot;I&quot;
could not think my way out of that fear.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are trying to pass off a guilt-inducing confession session as sane
self-analysis and introspection. They are not the same thing at all.
</font>
<p>
  
Again, I turned to this inner resource to remove my
self-centered fear.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Please explain how &quot;turning to an inner resource&quot; removes
&quot;self-centered&quot; fear. What you are trying to do is slip
self-deprecating Buchmanism into your argument with a few clever phrases.
What that really means is:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Oh, I was afraid because I was selfish and self-centered.  But if I had
stopped worrying about myself, I would have seen that Higher Power had
a special plan for me.&quot;</i>
</font>
</font>
<p>

In steps 8 and 9 I set right my past wrongs
(something nearly all spiritual teachers have advocated)  and in steps
10 and 11 I learned to  pay attention  as to who was running things &#8212; my
fears or my &quot;inner resource&quot;.
<p>
<font color="blue">
So now it is clear that you are trying to claim that your &quot;inner resource&quot;
is your idea of <i>God The Dictator Who Runs Things</i>.
You keep trying to assert that you are talking about the same thing
as me when I talk about drawing upon inner resources to conquer addiction.
We are not talking about the same thing at all. I do not believe in 
a Big Dictator who gives psychic orders and runs lives.
</font>
<p>

In step 12 I practice these principles
as they relate to all departments of my life and report on the results
to other alcoholics who can't quit drinking.
<p>
<font color="blue">
The 12 Steps of A.A. are not spiritual principles. They are cult religion practices.
<p>
And you can't &quot;practice these principles in all of your affairs&quot;.
What, do you list and confess all of your sins while shopping for groceries?
Ask Higher Power to give you a little extra power while filling your car's
gas tank? Conduct a s&eacute;ance and get psychic work orders from Higher Power
while driving down the freeway? Admit that you are powerless and a self-centered
loser when your boss tells you to get a job done?
</font>
<p>
The report by the way is
that I am a free man, I never *have* to go to another AA meeting for the
rest of my life if I don't care to, and I am useful to others once
more.  This state of affairs seems to be unending so long as I stay
connected to that inner resource.
<p>
<font color="blue">
It is all fine and well &#8212; really, a good thing &#8212; that you got a grip
and quit drinking. But that does not prove that practicing Buchmanism
is a good thing.
</font>
<p>
So no, I am not reversing the meaning of step 1 &#8212; of myself, I cannot
quit and stay quit for good and all.  So most of your reply doesn't
apply in my case.  And I am in contact with  a rather long list of
drinkers who have had very similar experiences to mine described above.
They too are free men.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is an attempt at
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2numbers" target="newwin08">Appeal
to Numbers (<i>Argumentum ad Numerum</i>)</a>&quot;.
The fact that you can list some people &#8212; even many people &#8212; 
who share your Buchmanite beliefs does not prove the validity of those beliefs.
Again, a long list of people who all sincerely believe that they are Jesus Christ
or Napoleon does not prove that their beliefs are true.
<p>
And of course you will not list the far larger number of people who did not get
happy outcomes from practicing Buchmanism.
That is the propaganda technique called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="newwin10">Observational Selection</a>&quot;.
</font>
<p>
That is my experience.  Whether you had that experience or not, and
whether you accept that that was my experience or not is up to you.  You
will have to decide for yourself.
<p>
Again I want to thank you for all the historical information you have
provided.  It is of great interest and surely illustrates that the
founders of AA were indeed flawed &#8212; as are we all!

Hi Terry,

<p>
Just read your response about Ol' Bill not being a mason. Looks like Dr. Bob may
have been one:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is not well known that Dr. Bob was a Mason. Suspended in 1934, he gained
reinstatement after being sober for some years.[4] According to John Weldon, &quot;The
truth is that Masonry is a distinct religion that espouses teachings incompatible
with Christian faith in the areas of God, salvation, and other important
doctrines.&quot;[5]<br>

Hi Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the input. That's very interesting.
<p>
<a name="Jefferson"> </a>
Incidentally, I just got another shred of information about the circle
and triangle image &#8212; the pyramid with the eye &#8212; on the dollar bill.
Some people have claimed that it is a Masonic symbol, and that it
hints at the power of a secret mystical order, and that many of
the Founding Fathers of the USA were Masons.

<p>
But it seems that Thomas Jefferson had something to do with it, and his
opinions were just the opposite of the Masons.
Jefferson wanted religion and superstition
out of government. To him, the eye on the pyramid was the Eye of Reason.
The inscription around the pyramid,
&quot;A new order for a new age&quot; &#8212;
<i>&quot;Annuit Coeptis Novus Ordo Seclorum&quot;</i> &#8212; meant
that we would have an age of reason, not another age of belief or superstition.
<p>
And Jefferson was very proud of the fact that when he founded the
University of Virginia, there was no chapel on the campus (a historic
first), and that religion was not forced on the students as a part of
the curriculum (another historic first).
<p>
But Dr. Bob being a Mason, now that's interesting. I'll have to check that
out further. And I'm still open to the suggestion that Bill Wilson may
have had some involvement with the Masons, if anybody has any evidence.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;AARON F.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	sex addiction and SLAA<br>

<p>
Hi Orange:

<p>
Well it has been many months now I have not engaged in the sexual behaviors
that caused me troubles and ten-plus years of hell in SLAA groups and meetings.
I have managed to not engage in these behaviors by a combination of thinking
about not only the negative consequences of engaging in these actions but also
the positive &quot;consequences&quot; of NOT engaging in these actions, and also by
substituting other, non-harmful behaviors for the harmful ones.
<p>
SLAA is full of crazy, toxic people and harmful and dangerous ways of thinking
and behaving. And, most importantly, for the majority of people it doesn't
work, by which I mean it doesn't help them stop doing the behaviors they want
to stop doing. I think in my case being under the influence of the SLAA world
actually made me engage in my destructive behaviors more, because of the shame
the group caused and from being around a group of chronic relapsers all the
time. Plus I think for any intelligent person, the act of ignoring or
sublimating the clear knowledge that these programs are bunk and playing along
with something they know doesn't really make sense must set up some kind of
problem in the brain. It is a shame there are not really any alternatives to
these 12 step groups for people with sexual problem behaviors. I also think it
is really terrible that these groups are pushed at sex-addiction rehabs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Aaron,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I hope you are well.
<p>
The evidence just keeps mounting that practicing
Buchmanism does not produce good results. And I agree that it is a tragedy
that 12-Step groups are the only &quot;support groups&quot; offered for
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#group_list" target="newwin12">a lot of things</a>.
What's wrong with today's generation of psychologists and psychiatrists?
Can't they invent something better? (Well, actually, there is
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731125155/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="newwin13">SMART</a>
and
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin14">AVRT</a>...)
<p>
Are you a compulsive clutterer? Or a grown-up former abused child of alcoholics?
Or dying from Hep C? Join a Buchmanite cult and confess your sins...
And they call that &quot;self-help&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
