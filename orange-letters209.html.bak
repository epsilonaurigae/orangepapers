Mister T,

Thank you for all you do.  What are your thoughts about me printing business cards
with the orange-papers web site address and giving them out?   Do you have any
objections?  Someone told me the word authoress is sexist.  These things are beyond
me so I will just pass it on to you.

I was pleased at how easy it was to use pay-pal to contribute to your work.  I was
told many years ago at AA meetings to put the price of one drink into the basket.  I
now say to your supporters to send the price of one drink to you on occasion.

Hello again, Bob,
<p>
Of course you may print up cards with the Orange Papers URL and give them away. That sounds
like a good thing to do. And, if you are in a printing mood, I've also suggested printing sheets
of
<a href="orange-jokes.html" target="_blank">the jokes</a>,
and giving them away. (To the right audience, of course. Watch out. Some people totally pop
a cork when they see jokes poking fun at their religion.)

<p>
I do not see the word &quot;authoress&quot; as sexist. It is just the correct word to use.
There are lots of word pairs that reveal gender, like &quot;actor &#8212; actress&quot;, and
I don't think that is sexist.
(Also &quot;King &#8212; Queen&quot;, &quot;Lord &#8212; Lady&quot;, &quot;Baron &#8212; Baroness&quot;, etc.)
<p>
 
Some word pairs are now considered archaic and have fallen into disuse,
like &quot;manager &#8212; manageress&quot;, and
&quot;governor &#8212; governess&quot;, and &quot;master &#8212; mistress&quot;.

<p>
Still, as far as I know, &quot;author &#8212; authoress&quot; is still the correct usage.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	FORMER P.G.<br>

<p>
DEC 1<br>
Used to be part of the Pacific group in LA. Got 11 years clean and sober now.  No
relapse. 
<p>
They gave me the structure I needed coming homeless off the streets zonked out of my
mind. But I'll be honest... a lot of stuff in PG, under Clancy's direction I didn't
agree with. 
<p>
Not the AA way, but Clancy's way. I stuck it out and did it exactly their &#8212;  Clancy's
&#8212; way. 
<p>
But after 5 years... no matter how hard I tried having a normal life;  getting real
work, even with my BA and MFA,things kept crashing and burning.   I didn't drink or
use, but a real, normal life I wouldn't call it. 
<p>
It was only after I left LA &#8212;  left PG &#8212;  that 6 years later now, things are slowly
going up. Many ups and downs in these 11 years... but I've done one thing more right
than anything else:
<p>
No matter what has happened &#8212;  I have not taken a drink or used a drug. No matter
what. And that is not because I won the lottery or married a beauty queen... or have
all this outside stuff. It is not because I've networked or have had doors open for
me. I saw too many relapses in my first few years in LA... and these were people with
money;  great cars; great outside success. I think a lot relapse... because they're not
willing to do whatever it may take to stay clean and sober no matter what... like I
did. 
<p>
I owe it all to my higher power... whatever that force is. But, it's not a human being
and it's not a group. And I owe it to bringing the 12 steps into every part of my
life &#8212;  especially how I deal with people and life. 
<p>
There's a lot of giving up I do every day. But I am no longer a door mat for anyone
like I might've been my first few years, doing everything other drunks ordered me to
do... like I found WITH SOME &#8212; NOT ALL &#8212;  in PG. 
<p>
My first year foundation is solid.  No cracks in it. That's a big part in my new way
of life. And I thank my higher power, not PG, every day. But, I thank PG for waking me
up when I needed it, and when no one else did. 
<p>
All the best to you and yours. One day at a time.

Hi Mark,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety. It's good that you got a grip
and quit drinking, and have kept yourself sober for so many years.
I see that you are convinced that somebody or something else made you
quit, and there is probably nothing that I can say that will make you see that the 12 Steps
are not good for your mental health.
<p>
So all that I can say is, have a good day and Merry Christmas. And good luck.

I have many questions and comments. But I will only ask one question. As I
don't wish to debate the effectiveness of AA or any other 12step program.
Are you or have you ever thought of yourself as an alcoholic, &quot;problem
drinker&quot; or addict  (currently or formerly) ???

<p>

Hello JR,
<p>
The simple answer is, &quot;yes&quot;.
<p>
You can read my history here:

and here:

<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="newwin59">Who are you?</a>.
</ul>

<p>
But watch out for the definitions.
Alcoholics Anonymous routinely uses three or four different definitions of the word
&quot;alcoholic&quot;, and mixes them up, with really muddies the water and confuses the issues.
Read the definitions <a href="orange-letters126.html#definitions" target="newwin140">here</a>.

<p>
Now I have a question for you: Why don't you &quot;wish to debate the
effectiveness of AA or any other 12step program&quot;?
Do you believe that the failure rate of A.A. is really indefensible?

I am the mother of 9 children. My husband who had been sober for over
13 years started drinking again 4 years ago. A year and a half ago he
got involved in AA. He has stopped drinking but the  teachings of AA
and his over-involvement with AA is ruining our marriage. Since he
found AA our life together has been a living nightmare. He stopped
communicating with me, only communicating with his sponsor or others in
the group and telling me that if I had a problem I needed to get into
Al-Anon and get my own program going and my own sponsor to talk to. My
husband left me this past week (with 6 children still at home),
choosing his AA family over us.

The L-rd led me to your website. I
have found numerous books and publications that I would like to read
myself and hopefully show the counselor who is trying to help us. But,
some of the ones that seemed like they would be helpful do not have
ISBN or Dewey #'s. Can you tell me how I can go about obtaining these
particular publications? Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

<font color="blue">
Hello Laura,
<p>
Thanks for your letter. I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
<p>
The first place to look for information about books is in
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">the bibliography, here</a>.
I list all of the ISBN numbers and Dewey numbers, if the books have one.
You can quickly find individual books by using your browser's built-in search function,
usually a slash. In Firefox, for instance, just type a slash and a little box opens at the
bottom of the window for you to type in key words.
So go to the bibliography page, and then search within it.

<p>
Most all books published after 1950 or 1960 have ISBN numbers; but before that,
the publishers had not invented the system yet. Then, you have to go by the author's name,
book title, publisher, and year of publication.
<p>
For finding rare old books, I have not found anything better than Worldcat.
Worldcat is something that the libraries use. It means something like &quot;world catalogue&quot;.
Somehow, most all of the libraries in the USA and Canada are in it. That means universities,
and city and county libraries, and medical schools, and theological seminaries, and everything.
<p>
Exactly how the system is accessible to you differs from one library to another, so I would
go to your local city or county library, and ask for help. My usual routine was to use the
libraries' computers and get into their search system. Now, I have my own laptop, and get into
the library's catalogue through their web page. Both ways work just fine.
<p>
And if you don't have a library card,
definitely get one. Here, they are free to county residents.
In fact, even the inter-library loans are free. That is, if you want some rare old book or obscure book
that the local library does not have, you can request it through Worldcat. It usually takes
about two weeks, and you have the book &#8212; for free. (Isn't Big Government wonderful?)
That is how I got all of those rare old books about the Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament.
(Yes, taxpayer-supported libraries helped to finance the research for the Orange Papers.)
<p>
You can also use the catalog of
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221725/http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.
That is often helpful too. Mind you, you don't have to
buy the book from them, but you can find it and get ISBN numbers or Dewey numbers, and publisher's
name and year, and all of that, from the listing that Amazon has for the book.
I have seen Amazon also have rare old books that are so rare that not even Worldcat had a listing.

<p>
Good luck, and I hope your life gets happier. So try to have a good day.

Classified By: Charge d'Affaires Sylvia Reed Curran. Reasons 1.4(b) and (d).<br>

<p>
&para;1. (C) An Iranian specialist in the treatment of drug<br>
addiction spoke to Iran Watcher this week about medical and<br>
legal approaches to the problem in Iran. xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
(please protect), xxxxxxxxxxxx contrasted Turkmenstan's punitie and<br>
abstinence-based, rather than treatment-oriented, stance<br>
towards drug abusers with that of Iran. There, he said,<br>
criminal laws governing drug use have evolved significantly<br>
in the xxxxxxxxxxxx years he has been working in the<br>
field of addiction. In the 1980s, Iran's penal code imposed<br>
harsh sentences on narcotics users, but began to change in<br>
the 90s. This was due in part, he said, to the input of<br>
experts like himself who emphasized the effectiveness of<br>
treatment over retributive justice. These days, drug users<br>
in Iran who are actively seeking treatment are not subject to<br>
criminal penalties.<br>

<p>
Narcotics anonymous: 50,000 members<br>

<p>
&para;2. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx said that about 20 years ago, three young<br>
Iranians, recovering drug abusers, returned from long<br>
residences in the U.S. and started a branch of Narcotics<br>
Anonymous. Since then, it has grown to an organization of<br>
50,000 members with branches that hold regular meetings<br>
throughout the country. He added that drug use in Iran is a<br>
long-standing problem, dating back several hundred years, and<br>
that it knows no particular socio-economic boundaries. He<br>
cited depression as the most common reason that Iranians<br>
abuse mood altering substances. Despite a significant drug<br>
abuse problem in the country, Iranians actually use (though<br>
do not necessarily abuse) alcohol much more than they do<br>
drugs. In his view, there is a portion of these suffers from<br>
depression that does not respond successfully to therapy and<br>
will always seek mood altering substances. They account for<br>
the 150,000 Iranians who receive regular,<br>
government-sanctioned doses of methadone.<br>

<p>
&para;3. (C) According to xxxxxxxxxxxx twelve-step<br>
programs have been highly successful in treating drug<br>
dependent Iranians, in sharp contrast to other Muslim<br>
countries, such as Egypt and others in the Middle East. He<br>
attributes this to the comfort that Iranians feel culturally<br>
with the tenets of the program, particularly the concept of<br>
&quot;evil.&quot; Whereas in Islam, evil is considered to be &quot;a<br>
creation of God that must be eradicated,&quot; he said that<br>
Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Iran, in contrast,<br>
acknowledges evil as a normal component of human nature that<br>
can be acknowledged and overcome.<br>

Hello Jason,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. Now that is interesting. I didn't know that Steppism had made such inroads
in Iran. I would have thought that the Islamic fundamentalists would strongly object to such
heresy and idolatry as &quot;anything as your God, a light bulb, a motorcycle, a doorknob, a tree...&quot;
I guess that the A.A. promoters must gloss that over and say that only Allah
is acceptable as the Higher Power.
<p>
Also guessing, I think that the reason that the Dept. of State classified that is:
they classify everything. It's just habit.
And they did have reason to protect the identity of their informant, whose name is
safely redacted in the released text.
<p>
I have my doubts about how &quot;highly successful&quot; the 12-Step programs have been in Iran.
It is easy to assume a cause-and-effect relationship where there is none.
Specifically, if Narcotics Anonymous is so highly successful, why do they have 150,000
addicts on government-approved Methadone?
The author of that cable did not supply any numbers to indicate how much 12-Step programs reduced
the problem, if they did at all. Maybe the 12-Step programs are only successful at recruiting
cult members.
<p>
This statement is actually quite intelligent and perceptive, in spite of the mangled grammer:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In his view, there is a portion of these suffers from
depression that does not respond successfully to therapy and
will always seek mood altering substances. They account for
the 150,000 Iranians who receive regular,
government-sanctioned doses of methadone.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately, the treatment is not intelligent. Neither Methadone nor
guilt-inducing 12-Step religion is appropriate treatment for depression.
I know that there are better medicines for depression than Methadone.

<p>
Then the report says that Iranians use alcohol much more than they do drugs.
So that means that they have a large number of alcoholics.
That does not sound like a highly successful program.
There is actually zero evidence that 12-Step programs have done anything good for Iran.

<p>
Have a good day now, and have a Merry Christmas.

Hi Terry,
<p>
Woohoo!!!!
<p>
<i>SMILE 'TIL IT HURTS:  The Up With People Story</i>
 opens in Portland on December 17.
<p>
You can catch a screening at the Hollywood Theatre.  4122 N.E. Sandy Blvd.,
Portland Oregon.  It's supposed to run for two consecutive weekends so
perhaps you are in town? Also, please tell everyone you know as I
think the film generates a lot of interesting discussion!
<p>
You can check for details at

<p>
The &quot;Up With People&quot; show was of course the song-and-dance show that Moral Re-Armament did that
was popular in the 'seventies. You can read about it on my web page,
<a href="orange-rroot720.html" target="_blank">The Last Hurrah: Up With People</a>.

I would like to hear your &quot;solution&quot; to help the alcoholic who CANNOT stop drinking,
fully recover to live a useful, purposeful, &amp; fulfilling life? Please educate me,
because I can use a good laugh...

Hello Ashaziz,
<p>
First off, I reject your
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hypothetical" target="_blank">hypothetical case of someone &quot;who CANNOT stop drinking&quot;</a>.
That is just the standard A.A. stereotype of &quot;the alcoholic&quot; that declares that alcoholics
are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; and cannot quit drinking without joining Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Now if someone is badly addicted, then he needs detoxing in a detox center or hospital.
<p>
After that, there are a variety of treatments and aids available, all better than A.A.
<p>
Professors Reid K. Hester and William R. Miller (UNM, Albuquerque &#8212;
Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology,
University of New Mexico), rated treatment modalities by success rate.
Here are the results:<br>

http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/53/1/What-works-A-summary-of-alcohol-treatment-research/Page1.html</a><br>
== The same statistics in a different format
</ul>
<p>
The most successful treatment is &quot;Brief Intervention&quot;.<br>
<p>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.
<p>
&quot;Brief Intervention&quot; consists of a real doctor talking to the
patient for usually less than one hour, questioning him about all of the
ugly details of his drinking and telling him that he will die if he doesn't
quit drinking.  One time.
That's it. No long counseling sessions, no great guidance, no on-going
advice, no shoulder to cry on. And no 28-day treatment program. No years of A.A. meetings.
Just one &quot;Dutch Uncle&quot; session and it's over.
And that's the most effective thing going.

<p>
One of the least successful things going is Alcoholics Anonymous, which just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raises the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate</a>.
<p>
People who want a support group can find companionship in a variety of organizations that do less
harm than A.A., like SMART, SOS, Lifering, and Women For Sobriety.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	At long last<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
Will you be my sponsor?  I've heard it said that sunlight is the best
disinfectant.  Found your sight and have been up all night basking in the
sunlight of truth.  I have been in and out of AA for over 20 years and have
found it to beneficial but am getting tired of being accused of thinking too
much.  In all the years the thing which has kept me sober the longest was
getting married to a mormon girl and having 4 kids.  Ironically she died of
addiction related issues three years ago and I have been unable to stay
sober for more than several months at a time since.  I keep going to AA and
while I do get something out of it I am getting tired of a bunch of
cigarette smoking automatons telling me that my thinking isn't that great
and that self knowledge will avail me nothing and so I go back drinking.  I
quit smoking over 18 years ago after getting married and cant figure out why
I cant seem to apply the same sort of will power to my drinking.  Now I know
I can, if I choose to.

<p>
I think the bullshit about getting a sponsor and confessing my powerlessness
to feed someones ego is one of the prime factors in my feeling depressed and
is playing a major role in my choosing to drink again.  Plus every time I do
it doesn't get worse than before, but it is a lot worse than what choosing
sobriety is.  I want sobriety and I crave social interaction so I keep going
back to AA and while I find some things I hear there work for me, they wont
seem to let me take what I want and leave the rest.  The mormons frankly are
seeming more tolerant of my thinking for myself these days than are the AAs,
but thats a tough fit as well.  Anyhow, thank you for all of your hard work
and research in hashing out the truth....  Its ironic that the AA coins say
&quot;to thine own self be true&quot; but when I am immediately shamed by some old
timer who thinks I want to hone in on one of his cigarette breathed 13th
step prospects.

<p>
Anyhow I could go on and on, but it is late, Suffice it to say I don't know
if I will continue to go to AA, but if I do I will know that my sponsor is
honesty and openmindedness and my mind sober is higherpowered enough to stay
that way if I am willing.   Thanks for the fresh air.

<p>

 Anti-Medication: all this in *&quot;a report from a group of physicians in
A.A.&quot;* No names, no qualifications &#8212; Nothing. Why do A.A. members have to
take specialized medical advice from an unnamed group of alleged physicians
in A.A? It contains...

<p>
<ul>
<li>
 &#8212; The implication that the recovering (any) alcoholic is prone to becoming
addicted to other medications. Who made that up?
<li>
 &#8212; More stereotyping of the alcoholic's natural response to go overboard
on medications. Seriously?
<li>
 &#8212; More garbage about a *&quot;peculiar susceptibility&quot;* of alcoholics to
certain medications. Total nonsense.
<li>
 &#8212; Advice to find another doctor if the one you have doesn't agree with
A.A. teachings, i.e. s/he doesn't understand.
<li>
 &#8212; Admission that an anti-medication stance is displayed by some A.A.
members. Surely important enough for a newcomer to know that it be printed
on page one of the big book instead of buried in the appendix of Living
Sober?
<li>
 &#8212; Claim that the anti-medication stance has *&quot;undoubtedly prevented
relapse for some.&quot;* According to what studies?
<li>
 &#8212; Admission that this anti-medication stance has resulted in suicide,
sorry, A.A. describes it euphemistically as *&quot;disaster&quot;.*
</ul>
<p>
And it's still legal!?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Good points.
And they basically try to reduce A.A. members to some cry-baby whiners who are just complaining
about minor aches and pains and want to take pain-killers.
Again,
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the real A.A. attitude towards alcoholics</a>
is one of condescending contempt.
<p>
At the end, they admit that A.A. members have killed mental cases by telling them not to take their
medications.
Still, the attitude of the whole paper is a confused contradiction:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't take any painkiller medications, you whiner.
But maybe somebody might need to take something.&quot;
</font>
<p>
And they call that instructions that everybody should read?
</font>

Living_Sober-AA_admits_that_Bill_wrote_first_11_Ch_of_Big_Book.pdf</a><br>
<p>
 In the other attached file: A.A. admits that Bill Wilson wrote the
first eleven chapters of the Big Book!
<p>
When I quoted this at A.A. meetings members would most frequently respond
with the usual &quot;NO! It was written by the first hundred.&quot;
One member with 7 years sobriety even told me that the Big Book was *&quot;written
by 100 people over a period of 6 years!&quot;*
<p>
When I pointed out that there was only 3yrs and 10mo between Bill and Bob
meeting and the publication of the Big Book I was met with a glassy eyed
stare and a tight lipped silent grimace that cannot easily be described but
it was strange and wonderful to behold.
</ol>

<p>
<font color="blue">
This is also interesting because
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">in the lawsuits
in Germany and Mexico</a>, representatives of the
A.A. headquarters commmitted perjury in court and declared:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
In Germany, that Bill Wilson was the <i>sole</i> author of the whole book.
Not just the author of the first 164 pages, but of the whole thing.
<p>
<li> In Mexico, that the Big Book</i> was 
<a href="orange-AAWS-005.gif" target="_blank">written rather recently, by &quot;Wyne Parks&quot;</a>,
so it is still under an unexpired copyright.
</ul>

</font>
<p>
Finally, in regard to your opinion that A.A. members should be legally held
accountable for dispensing harmful medical advice. I don't think that
argument will fly. There is no contract between the newcomer and the A.A.
member in regard to the advice dispensed. It is simply bad advice. Horribly
bad in some instances but without any legal responsibility it seems.
*&quot;You can carry the message but not the alcoholic&quot;* as A.A. regulars will
say when a member commits suicide. *&quot;They committed the most selfish
act&quot;* according to one A.A. member of 25yrs at my home group.
Disgusting, degrading attitudes to suicide abound in A.A.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Probably true. They will probably escape with technicalities and weasel words.
Like,
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;We never promised you anything. Show me the contract.&quot;
</font>

</font>
<p>
However, can medical/treatment professionals: doctors, psychologists,
counselors, social workers, psychiatrists, etc., be held legally responsible
for their recommendations to attend A.A.? I think so. If they are
recommending A.A. as a method of treatment, or part of treatment, in a
professional capacity then surely they must be bound by
medical/ethical/legal principles? If so, then a law suit against a medical
professional for malpractice for recommending A.A. attendance which resulted
in either emotional trauma, abuse, suicide or attempted suicide would have
to be fought and proved in court. It may be hard to argue but at least it
would be debated in public and hopefully before a judge who would have to
adhere to U.S. Constitutional Law and not merely &quot;traditions.&quot;
Why the trial lawyers are not all over this one I do not know?
All it would take is one bad decision against a medical professional and
that might scare any other professionals from recommending A.A. as a
treatment method. Don't you think? Just ideas....

<p>
<font color="blue">
I also don't know why lawyers are not all over that one. It sure looks like some money for
someone to take.

<p>
Keep up the good fight,<br>

From:  	&quot;Taylor W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
A. Orange,

<p>
I was recently reading some of your articles about Alcoholics Anonymous and Bill
Wilson, among other things, and wanted to share my experience with &quot;the program&quot;
with whoever might (or might not) read this e-mail. Before I even start with the AA
story, I feel I should mention that I was addicted to drugs, but that hasn't been a
problem for years. I accomplished this with the help of a close friend and some
serious dedication to my cause. No treatment programs or self help groups. I did
keep drinking though, and that was looking a whole lot like a problem.

<p>
I went to AA at the suggestion of a long time friend. I don't know what he said to
me, because I was trashed, and I showed up to my first meeting that way. I went
because I wanted to get my buddy off my back, and because obviously I had a drinking
problem. I didn't plan on quitting the booze, I just thought if I hung out with a
bunch of drunks for a while, I'd be able to drink normally. I continued to go to
meetings for a short while until my car battery died. In truth, the club I attended
meetings at is within fairly easy walking distance of my home. Even before I decided
I would not continue to attend AA, I'd decided on three things that ran contrary to
the general program: 1. No higher power for me 2. I had no interest in working the
steps 3. I didn't want to be in that same room 25 years from now (and we did have
those guys). In retrospect, having established those ground rules was more or less a
rejection of AA, although I continued to attend meetings. I don't regret that I did,
however I'm equally glad I stopped and that I didn't spend any great deal of time
involved with AA. In the end, it was the Big Book that sealed the deal. I had my
doubts, but the constant mention of God, Creator, etc. reinforced my fears. So did
the chapter &quot;We Agnostics&quot;. The newest version reads like this &quot;As long as you
believe in an omniscient, interventionist deity named God, and kneel to pray to him
constantly, your higher power can be anything&quot;. There's also a bit that explains a
man is only ready for AA after he's given up on all reasonable, rational and logical
methods of achieving sobriety. That sure as shit wasn't me.

<p>
Anyway, I wanted to thank you for the Orange Papers. Because although I was happy
with my decision, and was still quite sober, I couldn't shake the nagging guilt
that'd been instilled in me in such a short time. I mean, here I was sober and happy
with that fact, and I was still thinking &quot;But I'm not going to meetings, I'm sure to
fail any day now&quot;. Of course, my AA brain, which has replaced my Alcoholic brain,
tells me that if your very well presented, organized and articulate articles make
sense to me, they must be wrong, you must be diseased also. You should probably seek
help... a specific kind of help, involving God and some steps.

<p>
Look forward to reading more of the website,<br>

Hello Taylor,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
And yes, isn't it insidious how
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">they plant ideas and phobias</a>
in your head that make you feel like you cannot live without them?
What a dirty trick.
<p>
Yes, that's why it's a cult.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Hello<br>

<p>
I was wondering if you could tell me if  your article is peer
reviewed. I happen to be a successful participant in A.A. and remained
there for the first 15 years of my sobriety. I have remained sober now
for 21+ years and I would like to explore this &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;
you speak of as possibly being true that I was going to get sober
anyway. However, I would tend to disagree in that A.A. in the
beginning did assist me in losing the obsession to drink.

Hello Jack,
<p>
The term &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; usually refers to scientific journals,
 where other doctors or scientists
will read articles before publication, and decide whether the article
 makes enough sense to
publish. Obviously, the Orange Papers is not a medical journal.
<p>
However, the web site most assuredly is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; in
 the sense that thousands or hundreds
of thousands of fellow &quot;alcoholics&quot; or &quot;ex-alcoholics&quot;
 have read it, and commented, and both
approved and criticized it.
