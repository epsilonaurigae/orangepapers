<p><br>

In the &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, in
the chapter &quot;The Family Afterward&quot;,
on page 135 (3rd and 4th editions), we read:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Whether the family goes on a spiritual basis or not, the
alcoholic member has to if he would recover. The others
must be convinced of his new status beyond the shadow of a
doubt. Seeing is believing to most families who have lived
with a drinker.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy
smoker and coffee drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged.
Seeing this, and meaning to be helpful, his wife
commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he was
overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not
ready to stop. His wife is one of those persons who really feels
there is something rather sinful about these commodities, so
she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him into a fit
of anger. He got drunk.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of course our friend was wrong &#8212; dead wrong. He had
to painfully admit that and mend his spiritual fences.
Though he is now a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous,
he still smokes and drinks coffee, but neither his wife nor
anyone else stands in judgement. She sees she was wrong
to make a burning issue out of such a matter when his more
serious ailments were being rapidly cured.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This sad story is supposedly an example of a man who is living
his life &quot;on a spiritual basis&quot;, while the rest of his family does
not. And it is somehow supposed to show us a man who is convincing
his family of his new sober status. <b><i>By smoking and getting drunk.</i></b>
Go figure.
<p>
<a name="intolerant"> </a>
The man is addicted to tobacco, and he is smoking himself
to death. His concerned wife is trying to save him from emphysema and lung cancer,
but the &quot;anonymous&quot; author Bill Wilson labels her
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;intolerant&quot;</font> because she
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;really feels there is something rather
sinful about these commodities.&quot;</font>
<p>
Notice how the author Bill Wilson grouped coffee and tobacco
in the same category, as mere &quot;commodities&quot;, so that the wife
would appear more intolerant. Bill also refused to look at the
numerous health aspects of smoking, or the stink, or the second-hand smoke,
or the expense; he only said that she feels that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;these commodities&quot; are &quot;rather sinful.&quot;</font>
Bill implied that the housewife was just an intolerant uptight
killjoy Puritanical nag.

<p>
Notice the powerful hidden assumption in this sentence:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;He
admitted he was overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was
not ready to stop.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<p>
Oh? Somebody can continue doing whatever
he is doing just because he <i>frankly</i> says that he isn't ready to stop?
<p>
When was the last time that you heard an A.A. recruiter accept that
as a valid excuse for someone to continue drinking alcohol?
<p>
<ul>
<li> Can an alcoholic who is drinking himself to death say, &quot;Frankly,
I know I'm over-doing it, but I'm just not ready to stop, right
now&quot;? And that makes it okay for him to continue drinking?
<p>
<li> Can a coke fiend who is smoking and snorting cocaine all
of the time say, &quot;I know
I'm over-doing it right now, but frankly, I'm not ready to stop just
yet&quot;? And that makes it okay for him to continue tweaking? 
<p>
<li> Can a junkie who is shooting heroin all of the time say, &quot;I know
I'm over-doing it right now, but frankly, I'm not ready to stop right
now&quot;? And that makes it okay for him to continue doping? 
</ul>
<p>
Sometimes, the &quot;anonymous&quot; author, Bill Wilson,
showed flashes of sheer
genius for foisting a mountain of bull, untruths, and false assumptions
on the reader with just a few cleverly-worded phrases, and this is
one of those times.
<p>
(By the way, arguing that &quot;Frankly, I'm not ready to quit just yet&quot; is
the propaganda trick of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#delay"><i>Arguing For Delay</i></a>:
<i>&quot;Let's not be hasty. Let's not do anything right now. Let's think about it some more. I'm
not ready just now. I'm not prepared to do anything. Maybe later.&quot;</i>)

<p>
Note that tobacco is the deadliest of the four drugs mentioned there,
if you do a body count. Heroin and cocaine kill 5 to 10 thousand
Americans per year each; alcohol kills 100 thousand, and tobacco
kills 420 thousand Americans per year. So if someone can keep on
smoking tobacco until it kills him just because he &quot;frankly&quot;
isn't ready to stop it just yet, then why shouldn't he be able to continue
taking any drug on Earth, including alcohol? Why make a big deal out
of the number two or number three killer drug if the number one killer
drug in America is perfectly okay, and quite compatible with a
life lived &quot;on a spiritual basis&quot;?
<p>
Then, when this allegedly &quot;spiritual&quot; A.A. member became
annoyed at his wife's attempts to save
his life, he threw an angry temper tantrum and drank alcohol.
Then
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He had to painfully admit that [he was wrong] and mend his
spiritual fences.&quot;</font>
<p>
Baloney. Even when he was on his knees,
confessing his wrongs to God and &quot;mending his spiritual fences&quot;,
he secretly grinned from ear to ear, and said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b><i>I WON!</i></b> I get to
keep my tobacco addiction. I really scared the Hell out of the
old bitch, and now she won't be
nagging me about my smoking any more!&quot;
</font>
And she doesn't.
He is now free to commit suicide by cigarette. (If he really wanted to
&quot;mend his spiritual fences&quot;, why didn't he &quot;make amends&quot;
by quitting smoking?)
<p>
Then, this story says, his wife sees the error of her ways, and
confesses that
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;she was wrong to make a burning issue out of
such a matter&quot;</font> (<i>horrendous pun!</i>) &#8212; that she was
wrong to worry about his potentially fatal tobacco addiction
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;when
his more serious ailments were being rapidly cured.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That's a typical <a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Buchmanite</a>
happy ending for a story: it ends with everybody confessing that
they were wrong. Baloney.
<p>
And what &quot;more serious ailments&quot; were being &quot;rapidly
cured&quot;? Obviously <i>not</i> his alcohol drinking, because he
just got drunk, using alcohol to get his own way.
He holds drinking over her as a blackmail weapon that he can use
on her again any time she threatens his tobacco addiction.
So just how is this guy's behavior &quot;spiritual&quot;?

<p>
What we are seeing here is not spirituality, but rather, the
naked face of
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#AVRT" target="_blank">the Addiction
Monster</a>, that dark ghoul who says,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I don't care what the cost is, or who dies, I want my fix.&quot;</i>
</font>
Indeed, that ghoul is the same monster as the one who craves
alcohol, and while it has been
temporarily weaned off of alcohol, it is still alive and well,
feeding itself with tobacco. And there
is no way in Hell that it will tolerate someone cutting off its
last food source. It will fight. It
doesn't even care if its own host is dying from the effects of
tobacco, it still wants its fix.
<p>
<a name="no_quit"> </a>
A big part of the message that Bill Wilson is
trying to sell us here is the idea that
us good-old-boy A.A. members should be able to indulge in anything
we want to, just as long as it isn't alcohol.
Since we so nobly gave up drinking alcohol, we richly
deserve life's other little pleasures.
Both Bill W. and Doctor Bob were heavy smokers, so they said over
and over again that smoking
is an okay vice. According to Bill Wilson, dying of self-inflicted
emphysema, lung cancer, and heart disease is perfectly
okay, and completely compatible with a spiritual life,
just as long as you do it sober.
Bill just didn't want to quit smoking, so he rationalized his nicotine
addiction, and said that he didn't really need to quit smoking &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;It's just a minor bad habit, just a
commodity like coffee, you know...&quot;</i></font>

another breath from an oxygen mask.
He didn't quit smoking until it was far too late for him, and
tobacco had destroyed his lungs.

Then he finally quit, but only
lasted for just a year and a half more, spent sucking his air from

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By the time Ebby Thacher died in 1966, a victim of emphysema, Bill had
been trying to quit smoking for more than twenty years. He'd also known
since the early sixties that he had emphysema himself. Smoking had begun
to impair his health in the 1940s, in the form of frequent colds and
chronic bronchitis, and his breathing was noticeably labored from the mid-1960s
onward. Yet even when his breathing became so problematic that he needed frequent
doses of oxygen to get through the day, he smoked.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A number of visitors to Stepping Stones during Bill's last years report
witnessing scenes in which Bill would be trying to decide whether to have
more oxygen or another cigarette. Inevitably, the cigarette won out.
Bill was thought to have finally quit smoking early in 1969, by which time
his bouts with bronchitis had become struggles with pneumonia, but several
people confirm that he was still smoking even after most everyone thought he
had quit. He hid cigarettes in his car, and for as long as he was still well
enough to drive, he smoked.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It seems beyond comprehension, but the evidence is inescapable. &nbsp; ...
&nbsp; [Bill Wilson] literally smoked himself to death.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson didn't bother to print a retraction, to warn his
fellow A.A. members about tobacco, when he found out that he was dying.
Bill was far too egotistical to admit that he had been wrong.
<p>
Bill Wilson died January 24, 1971, of emphysema and pneumonia.
<p>
In addition, there is now a lot of evidence that smoking makes <i>all</i>
cancers worse, even if tobacco didn't cause the cancer in the first
place.
Tobacco smoke contains something like 50 different carcinogenic
chemicals, and just the restriction of blood flow in the
capillaries that tobacco causes
makes it harder for the body to get blood with white blood cells and
antibodies to the cancer, to attack and kill the cancer.
Tobacco also cripples the immune system, which would also like to kill
the cancer.
<p>
Doctor Bob died of prostate cancer, while puffing on those cigarettes
to the bitter end.

<li>
The guy in this story was called
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;our friend&quot;</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;a most effective member of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</font>,
even after
he threw his angry temper tantrum and got drunk.
(That is the propaganda technique called a
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#stroking" target="_blank">Stroking Ploy</a>&quot;.)

<li>
His clean and sober wife, on the other hand, was described as
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;one of those persons...&quot;
</font>
<i>You know, one of those intolerant Puritanical nagging bitches...
Why, she drove him to drink; any guy can see that.</i>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...her intolerance finally threw him into a fit of
anger.&quot;<br></font>
<p>
No, it didn't. The truth is just the opposite. He chose to
become angry. He made no attempt at self-control.
He allowed his feelings of irritation to turn into anger &#8212; he even
pushed them to it &#8212;
because he felt that his tobacco
addiction was being increasingly threatened by his wife's
persistence, and he didn't want to give it
up. He chose to throw a big angry drunken temper tantrum,
and roar loudly, to tell his wife in no uncertain terms
that he wasn't going to give up his beloved drug addiction, and
if she pressed the point, he would
get drunk, just to spite her. His actions said,
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;If you don't let me smoke all I want, then I'll drink
myself to death, and it will all be your fault. So there!&quot;</b>
</font>

<p>
And he succeeded in his infantile game of brinkmanship. He
defeated her so totally that she never criticized his smoking
again, and Bill says that she confessed that she
was wrong to have even tried to get him to quit smoking.

This story is so stupid, so tragic, so vicious,
and so inappropriate, that only someone who has totally pickled
his brain with too much alcohol for too many years could possibly
think that this is a good story
to put in the <i>Big Book</i> as an example of an A.A. member living a
spiritual life while his wife
doesn't. But, alas, that's what Bill Wilson did.

<p>
What's also rather amazing is how many A.A. members think that
The <i>Big Book</i> is received
wisdom, the indisputable Word of God, as given to Bill Wilson. I
guess their brains got pickled too.

The story above would have us believe that the way to live a spiritual life,
and the way to convince your family that you are now sober for life,
is to smoke yourself to death while ignoring the pleas of your
concerned wife, and then drink alcohol and throw drunken temper tantrums
to get your own way, and then blame it all on your wife's nagging.
That is simply crazy.

There is no doubt about who the &quot;anonymous&quot; author of the
<i>Big Book</i> was: It was Bill Wilson. Several of the other early
A.A. members helped in the <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">preparation
of the book</a> &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;: chapter 1,
<i>Bill's Story</i>, was possibly written or rewritten by Joe Worth, and chapter
10, <i>To Employers</i>, was definitely written by
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst" target="_blank">Henry
&quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst</a>, and chapters 2 to 9 and 11 were
<i>somewhat</i> the product of teamwork, but Bill Wilson was the
principal author, if not the <i>only</i> author, as well as the
guiding light and the editor-in-chief of most all of the
non-autobiographical chapters, the famous &quot;first 164 pages&quot;
of the <i>Big Book</i>.

And Bill Wilson claimed sole ownership of the
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">copyright of the whole <i>Big Book</i></a>,
and also
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Bills_royalties" target="_blank">took most of
the royalties</a> from the sales of the
book for himself and Doctor Bob.
<p>

The <i>Big Book</i> clearly shows that Bill Wilson was insane.
Not just a little bit crazy, not funny crazy, but really crazy,
genuinely insane, clinically diagnosable. Mr. Wilson was suffering
from paranoid delusions of grandeur and a messianic complex,
or a narcissistic personality disorder &#8212; or perhaps some crazy
combination of all of them.

<p>
<a name="bathtub_gin"> </a>
Wilson was insane while he was drinking: he was suicidally
drinking immense, almost superhuman, quantities of cheap
rotgut whiskey or gin, one or two or even more fifths of it
per day &#8212; &quot;<b>Drinking to Die</b>&quot; is what A.A. calls it.

In the <i>Big Book</i>,
<font size="-1">(chapter 1, page 5, 3rd edition)</font>
either Bill Wilson or Joe Worth wrote in <i>Bill's Story</i>:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>"'Bathtub' gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine."</b><br>
</font>

<p>
<a name="brain_damage1"> </a>
The Prohibition-era &quot;Bathtub gin&quot; was infamous for being poisonous.
It was occasionally contaminated with methyl alcohol (&quot;wood alcohol&quot;),
which is terribly poisonous, and causes immense neural damage, if not blindness and death.
<p>
Then malnutrition and thiamine deficiency can lead to a horrifying condition
called <i>Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</i> where you suffer such massive brain
damage that you lose your short-term memory and ability to learn or remember anything new.
<p>
<a name="brain_damage"> </a>
The A.A. saying is, &quot;John Barleycorn promises us insanity or
death.&quot; And it's true.
<p>
Even Bill Wilson himself reported that problem. Bill recorded a set
of autobiographical tapes before his death, which the Hazelden Foundation
then used as source material to write an &quot;autobiography&quot; of Bill Wilson. Bill quoted
Dr. William D. Silkworth as saying, in midsummer 1934,
that he had originally had some hope for Bill, but...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;But his habit of drinking has now turned into an obsession, one
much too deep to be overcome, and the physical effect of it on
him has also been very severe, for he's showing some signs of brain
damage. This is true even though he hasn't been hospitalized very
much. Actually I'm fearful for his sanity if he goes on drinking.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W., My First 40 Years</i>, Bill W.,
page 116.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill wrote that Dr. Silkworth said that about Bill to Bill's wife Lois
when Bill was hospitalized for detoxing at
the Charles B. Towns Hospital in New York during the summer of 1934.
After that, Bill stayed sober for a few months, but then returned
to suicidal binge drinking.

<p>
Bill also described his third detoxing at Towns Hospital in the <i>Big Book</i>,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After a time I returned to the hospital. ...
My weary and despairing wife was informed that it would all end with heart
failure during delirium tremens, or I would develop a wet brain, perhaps within
a year. She would soon have to give me over to the undertaker or the asylum.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 1, page 7.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, while Bill Wilson was hospitalized for detoxing, from December 11th to 18th, 1934, at
Charles Towns' Hospital in New York yet again, for the <i><b>fourth</b></i>
time in just a little over a year, after yet another drinking-to-die binge,
Dr. William D. Silkworth gave Bill Wilson Charlie Town's specialty of the house &#8212;
a hallucinogenic quack medicine
&quot;<a href="#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna cure</a>&quot; for alcoholism (that was also
supposedly good for curing morphine addiction, bed-wetting, kleptomania,
&quot;cafeinism&quot;, or whatever else ails you).
When the drugs hit, Bill Wilson flipped out and
<a href="#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">&quot;saw the light&quot;, and saw
&quot;the God of the preachers&quot;</a>, he said, and got religion.
It seems like his &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and his miraculous conversion
came in time to save his liver, but not his brain.

<p>
Note that even Bill's reporting of Dr. Silkworth's diagnosis of
brain damage reveals Bill's delusions of grandeur. Bill Wilson thought
that it was a joke, just another alcoholic war story to brag about.
Bill thought that he was above minor problems like brain damage.
Other men might go insane from alcohol-induced brain damage, but
not Bill Wilson. It couldn't happen to a tough guy like him:

<p>
<blockquote>

Nan Robertson also reported Bill having a nasty problem with delusions of grandeur.
Bill Wilson's life in the period of 1930 to 1934 was like this:

<a name="men_of_genius"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
His hangovers and hallucinations were becoming more frequent.
He panhandled and stole from his wife's purse. He would ride the
subways for hours after buying a bottle of bootleg gin, talking gibberish
to frightened strangers. He threw a sewing machine at Lois and stormed around
their house in Brooklyn kicking out door panels. She called him a
&quot;drunken sot.&quot; He would be sober for days and weeks and then
settle into bottomless bingeing.
He barely ate. He was forty pounds underweight.
His dark, withdrawn periods alternated with delusions of grandeur.
Once he told Lois that &quot;men of genius&quot; conceived their best
projects when drunk.<br>

disappeared after he quit drinking, but Bill's writings do not show that.
Neither does the rest of the literature about Alcoholics Anonymous.

The rest of chapter 9 of <b>The <i>Big Book</i></b> &#8212; <i>&quot;The
Family Afterward&quot;</i> &#8212; features more strange, tortured thinking
about how the family and Father should function after Father gets
sober.
The &quot;anonymous&quot; author, Bill Wilson, begins by saying that a recovering
man will become either a workaholic or a religious maniac, and that
being a workaholic and trying to recover financially is hardly worth
the bother. (Funny that
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">we only get those two unpleasant choices</a>:
become a workaholic, or become a religious maniac. Why does drinking sound
like more fun?)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<!--
Many alcoholics are enthusiasts. They run to extremes. -->
At the beginning of recovery a man will take, as a rule,
one of two directions. He may either plunge into a frantic
attempt to get on his feet in business, or he may be so
enthralled by his new life that he talks or thinks of little else. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We think it dangerous if he rushes headlong at his economic problem.
The family will be affected also, pleasantly at first, as they feel their
money troubles are about to be solved, then not so pleasantly as they find
themselves neglected. Dad may be tired at night and preoccupied by day.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Mother may complain of inattention. They are all disappointed, and often
let him feel it.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
He is straining every nerve to make up for lost time.
He is striving to recover fortune and reputation and feels he
is doing very well.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sometimes mother and children don't think so. Having been neglected
and misused in the past, they think father owes them more than
they are getting. &nbsp; ...<br>
<a name="scarcely_make_amends"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The head of the house ought to remember that he is mainly to blame for
what befell his home. He can scarcely square the account in his lifetime.
But he must see the danger of over-concentration on financial success.
Although financial recovery is on the way for many of us,
we found we could not place money first. For
us, material well-being always followed spiritual
progress; it never preceded. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As each member of a resentful family begins to see his
shortcomings and admits them to the others, he lays a basis for
helpful discussion. These family talks will be constructive if
they can be carried on without heated argument,
self-pity, self-justification or resentful criticism. Little by
little, mother and children will see they ask too much, and
father will see he gives too little. Giving, rather than getting,
will become the guiding principle.<br>

<p>
Notice the guilt induction routine:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The head of the house ought to remember that he is mainly to blame for
what befell his home. He can scarcely square the account in his lifetime.&quot;<br>
</font>

First, Bill Wilson told you, in Step One, that you were
<i>powerless over alcohol</i> &#8212; &quot;it's a disease &#8212; you can't help it&quot;,
so you weren't responsible for your actions.
But now he tells you that
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#sin_model" target="_blank"><i>it's all your own fault</i></a>,
and you have been so bad that you can scarcely make amends for what you
have done, even if you try for the rest of your life.
Are you starting to feel guilty?

<p>
The next to last paragraph says that &quot;spiritual progress&quot;
&#8212; in other words, Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; must come before a man's job:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot; For us, material well-being always followed spiritual
progress; it never preceded.&quot;</i><br>
</font>

In Bill Wilson's mind,
&quot;spiritual progress&quot; meant going to A.A. meetings, doing
his Twelve Steps, recruiting more members for A.A.,
and convincing yourself of the truth of A.A.'s [Bill Wilson's] beliefs
and dogma. So go to A.A. meetings instead of getting a job. And don't
get a job that conflicts with the A.A. schedule; A.A. always comes first.

The last paragraph of that large <i>Big Book</i> quote above describes
a family where everyone becomes a good little
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Buchmanite</a> and
confesses everything in family meetings:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson was being grossly unrealistic there.
Bill was just painting a picture of a happy &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; dream world
where the whole family happily practices Buchmanism.
<p>
Bill and Lois had no children, so Bill had no experience
with having some scared, abused children of an alcoholic in his house.
But Bill certainly had plenty of experience with being the abused son of an
alcoholic father who abandoned his family when Bill was just a boy,
and then Bill felt that his mother abandoned him too, leaving him to be
raised by his grandparents. And Bill's mother had very serious
mental problems of her own &#8212; she ended up in a mental hospital later in life.
Bill Wilson seems to have gone into deep denial about the whole thing, and
blanked most of that out of his memory. That is typical of narcissism &#8212; just
suppress the feelings of rejection, humiliation, and helplessness, and
deny that one was ever hurt; just live in a dream world where everything
is wonderful.
<p>
Bill does not appear to have had a clue about how abused children of an
alcoholic will <i>never</i> get together with Father for a happy little
confession session where everybody admits his wrongs and &quot;moral
shortcomings&quot;. They will think,
<font color="blue">
&quot;<b>Anything you say can and will be used against you the next
time Father gets drunk, so don't say anything, <i>not ever</i>.</b>&quot;
</font>
So those happy little <i>Ozzy and Harriet</i>
family talks are as unlikely as snow in July, in Texas.
That was just some more deluded wishful thinking on Bill's part,
imagining that the family members will all somehow 
turn into happy little Buchmanites who are just tickled pink at the
opportunity to have family meetings and confess all of their sins, defects,
and shortcomings to each other.
<p>
Also notice how Alcoholics Anonymous (Wilson-style Buchmanism) is supposed to be the
religion of the whole family, not just a quit-drinking program for Father.

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<a name="Lowen2"> </a>
Dr. Alexander Lowen describes the development of a narcissistic
personality disorder in a way that is reminiscent of Bill Wilson's
childhood:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All of us are vulnerable to being hurt, rejected, or humiliated. Yet
not all of us deny our feelings, try to project an image of invulnerability
and superiority or to strive for power.
The difference lies in our childhood experiences. As children,
narcissists suffer what analysts describe as a severe narcissistic injury,
a blow to self-esteem that scars and shapes their personalities.
This injury entials humiliation, specifically the experience of being
powerlessness while another person enjoys the exercise of power and control
over one.
I don't believe that a single experience shapes character, but when a child
is constantly exposed to humiliation in one form or another,
the fear of humiliation becomes structured in the body and the mind.
Such a person could easily vow: &quot;When I grow up, I'll get power,
and neither you nor anyone else will be able to do this to me again.&quot;
Unfortunately, as we will see, such narcissistic injuries happen to many
children in our society because parents often use power to control their
children for their own personal ends.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i>, Alexander Lowen, M.D.,
pages 76-77.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And Bill's completely unrealistic picture of the alcoholic's family life
is explained by denial:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The narcissist faces the risk of being overwhelmed by feelings and going wild,
crazy, or mad, should his defense of denial break down.
This is especially true of anger. Every narcissist is afraid of going
crazy, because the potential for insanity is in his personality. This
fear reinforces the denial of feeling, creating a vicious circle.<br>

<font size="-1"><i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i>, Alexander Lowen, M.D.,
page 155.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="12X12q15"> </a>
That also explains Bill's strange attitude about anger. Bill insisted that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#accept_anything" target="_blank">you couldn't be angry
at all</a> &#8212; no matter what the reason &#8212; that it was very
&quot;unspiritual&quot; to be angry about anything:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about
&quot;justifiable&quot; anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't we
entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly angry with self-righteous
folk? For us in A.A. these are dangerous exceptions.
We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those better
qualified to handle it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="depression1"> </a>
And Dr. Lowen explained the suppressed anger this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The need to project and maintain an image forces the person to prevent
any feeling from reaching consciousness that would conflict with the image.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i>, Alexander Lowen, M.D.,
page 48.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That also gives us one cause for Bill Wilson's chronic, crippling, and long-lasting
fits of depression:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Suppressed anger is a leading cause of depression.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>

<a name="Bernstein6"> </a>
<a name="depression2"> </a>
<p>
And another cause for the depression is that narcissists tend become
depressed whenever someone contradicts their grandiose delusions. Bill certainly
had enough to be depressed over. He could see with his own eyes that his
so-called
&quot;spiritual program for recovery&quot; had
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">almost a 100% failure rate</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<a name="going_insane"> </a>
Next, Bill Wilson described what happens if the recovering man becomes
a religious maniac, rather than a workaholic.
Look at this text, and see if it isn't a fair description of a man going
insane with an obsessive-compulsive disorder:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Assume on the other hand that father has, at the outset, a
stirring spiritual experience. Overnight, as it were, he is a different
man. He becomes a religious enthusiast. He is unable to focus on anything
else. As soon as his sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course,
the family may look at their strange new dad with apprehension, then with
irritation. There is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and night.
He may demand that the family find God in a hurry, or exhibit amazing
indifference to them and say he is above worldly considerations. He may
tell mother, who has been religious all her life, that she doesn't know what
it's all about, and that she had better get his brand of spirituality while
there is yet time.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When father takes this tack, the family may react unfavorably.
They may be jealous of a God who has stolen dad's affections.
While grateful
that he drinks no more, they may not like the idea that God
has accomplished
the miracle where they failed. They often forget father was
beyond human aid.
They may not see why their love and devotion did not straighten him out.
Dad is not so spiritual after all, they say. If he means to right his past
wrongs, why all this concern for everyone in the world but his family? What
about his talk that God will take care of them?
They suspect father is a bit balmy!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, page 128.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Parts of that are, of course, ludicrous.

<p>
The first paragraph features all of the horrible
things that will happen if Father has had a &quot;stirring
spiritual experience&quot;, perhaps a
<a href="#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">drug-induced vision of God while
detoxing</a>:

The family will become increasingly concerned about father's
obvious monomaniacal obsession with religion
(<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank"><i>religion</i>, not
&quot;spirituality&quot;</a>) &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>He
becomes a religious enthusiast. He is unable to focus on anything
else</i>&quot; &#8212; &quot;<i>There is talk about spiritual matters
morning, noon and night</i>&quot; </font> &#8212;
and Bill dismisses the family's apprehension with
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;They may be jealous of a God who has stolen dad's
affections.&quot;
&nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;... they may not like the idea that God has
accomplished the miracle where they failed.&quot;</i></b>
</font>
<p>
Yes, <i>somebody</i> is insane, all right. Clinically certifiable.
Completely deluded; no contact with reality remaining:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;They may be jealous of a God who has stolen dad's
affections.&quot;</i></b><br>
</font>

Really now.
First he was an obnoxious drunk, and now he's an obnoxious
religious fanatic. When's he going to knock it off and just act
halfways normal?

<p>
Note the paranoia &#8212; Bill can just hear all of the people
talking about him behind his back, calling him insane:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Dad is not so spiritual after all, they say. If he means to
right his past wrongs, why all this concern for everyone in
the world but his family? What about his talk that God will
take care of them?
They suspect father is a bit balmy!
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
No joke.
</font>

<p>
But Bill was apparently incapable of taking their concerns about his
sanity seriously. He dismissed their suspicions as just
part of their &quot;jealousy of God&quot;, or their needless
general worrying.
The next line Bill wrote was,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;<i>He is not so unbalanced as they might think</i>&quot;</font>,<br>
and then Bill proceeded to rationalize father's behavior:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
They suspect father is a bit balmy!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He is not so unbalanced as they might think.
Many of us have experienced dad's elation. We have
indulged in spiritual intoxication.
Like a gaunt prospector, belt drawn in over the ounce of food,
our pick struck gold. Joy at our release from a lifetime of
frustration knew no bounds. Father feels he has struck something
better than gold. For a time he may try to hug the new treasure to
himself. He may not see at once that he has barely scratched a
limitless lode which will pay dividends only if he mines it for
the rest of his life and insists on giving away the entire product.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, &quot;The Family Afterward&quot;, pages 128-129.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a fair description of mania.
Bill Wilson called it &quot;spiritual intoxication&quot;, but it's really
mania &#8212; a kind of raving, giggling, laughing insanity.
That text is also a fair description of
a trap: <i>You will only benefit if you do the program for the rest
of your life.</i>
(<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_no_exit" target="_blank">You can't ever leave the
cult</a>.)
It also begs the question, &quot;Do you have to wait the rest of
your life
for the benefits to start?&quot; No?
Well then, why couldn't you benefit from doing it for
less than the rest of your life, like maybe half,
and then getting the &quot;dividends&quot; and running away?
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Giving it all away&quot;</font> is a deceptive
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">euphemism</a>.
It really means recruiting new members for Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. also uses the sayings,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We can only keep that which we give away&quot;</font>, and<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Freely giving away that which was freely given to us&quot;</font>, and<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Faith without works is dead&quot;</font>,<br>
all of which also mean the same thing:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Recruit new members as we were recruited;
indoctrinate as we were indoctrinated;
convert as we were converted.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>

So,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Mining the lode for the rest of his life and giving it all
away&quot;</i><br>
</font>
really means that he has to &quot;work the program&quot; and
recruit for the cult for the rest
of his life, or else he won't get the &quot;dividends&quot;.
True-believer A.A. members actually believe that they <i>must</i>
constantly recruit new members (do &quot;Twelfth Step work&quot;),
or else they will relapse and die drunk in a gutter.

<p>
Incidentally, the line about
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;For a time he may try to hug the new treasure to himself&quot;</i>
</font>
is absurd. Bill Wilson did not try to keep his new religious beliefs
to himself after his drug-induced &quot;spiritual experience&quot; in Towns Hospital.
He immediately turned into a fanatical missionary
who drove all of the alcoholics around him crazy with
his proselytizing and recruiting attempts.
Bill was actually starting home churches within days of his pharmaceutical
&quot;vision of God&quot;.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Hug the new treasure to himself...&quot;</i></font>
That's delusional, again.


<p>
<a name="vagaries"> </a>
Then Bill admits that father isn't quite right in the head, but says that
it's okay, because it's just a passing phase. And, Bill says,
father's return to sanity depends on the family not annoying
or irritating him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If the family cooperates, dad will soon see that he is suffering
from a distortion of values. He will perceive that his spiritual
growth is lopsided, that for an average man like himself, a
spiritual life which does not include his family obligations may
not be so perfect after all. If the family will appreciate that
dad's current behavior is but a phase of his development, all
will be well. In the midst of an understanding and sympathetic
family, these vagaries of dad's spiritual infancy will quickly
disappear.<br>

<p>
If you let him do whatever he wants, then the situation will magically
fix itself in short order. Bill says that father will quickly perceive
that his behavior is inappropriate, and
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;these vagaries of dad's spiritual
infancy will quickly disappear.&quot;</font>
<p>
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Bill Wilson's &quot;vagaries&quot;
ever disappeared.

the Alcoholic Foundation into giving him and Doctor Bob most of the
royalties money, and he got rich off of the book.
Bill Wilson never worked a straight job again in his whole life.
He just made A.A. support him.
<p>
Incidentally, the American Psychiatric Association does not recognize
any such mental problems as &quot;vagaries of spiritual infancy&quot;.
<p>
But if the family won't do things Bill's way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The opposite may happen should the family condemn and criticize.
Dad may feel that for years his drinking has placed him on the
wrong side of every argument, but that now he has become a
superior person with God on his side. If the family persists in
criticism, this fallacy may take a still greater hold on father.
Instead of treating the family as he should, he may retreat
further into himself and feel he has spiritual justification for
so doing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Though the family does not fully agree with dad's spiritual
activities, they should let him have his head. Even if he
displays a certain amount of neglect and irresponsibility towards
the family, it is well to let him go as far as he likes in
helping other alcoholics. During those first days of
convalescence, this will do more to insure his sobriety than
anything else. Though some of his manifestations are alarming and
disagreeable, we think dad will be on a firmer foundation than
the man who is placing business or professional success ahead of
spiritual development.
He will be less likely to drink again, and anything is preferable to that.<br>

Chapter 9, <i>The Family Afterwards</i>, pages 129-130.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, the solution is to let Father act crazy,
even if his behavior is &quot;alarming and disagreeable&quot;.
Don't criticize him, or else really bad things will happen, Bill says.
(Narcissists just can't stand criticism.)
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;If the family persists in criticism, this fallacy may take a still greater hold on father.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">
<i>Arguing From Adverse Consequences</i></a> &#8212; declare that
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Something really bad will happen if you don't do what I want.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
So you shouldn't bother Father with mere reality, or ask him to be sane
and responsible, or tell him to go get a job, or else something really
terrible will happen.
Just let him neglect his family and irresponsibly
devote his entire life to Alcoholics Anonymous.
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Housewives, just watch passively as your husband turns into a babbling bombastic
believer in a crazy contentious cult.</i>
</font>
Then everything will turn out okay.
He will supposedly be on a &quot;firmer foundation&quot;
than someone who works for a living and behaves normally. This is a repetition of
the idea that Bill Wilson stated earlier, that working hard, earning a living,
and trying to recover financially, is a mistake &#8212; that A.A. should come first.
Let your wife support you while you go recruiting for Alcoholics Anonymous.

This appears to be highly</a> autobiographical: Bill Wilson
didn't bother to get a real paying job and support his wife Lois after he
sobered up; he continued to let her support him.
He made religious mania and proselytizing for the Oxford Group,
and then for Alcoholics Anonymous, his full-time hobby, for
the rest of his life. No wonder she was screaming,
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;Damn your old
meetings!&quot;</b></font><font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt05">5</a></sup></font>

<p>
Again, Bill Wilson used the
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Argue from
Adverse Consequences</a>&quot; propaganda trick
to blackmail the housewife:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>Let him devote himself to
his &quot;spiritual activities&quot; [A.A. busywork], so that
&quot;dad will be on a firmer
foundation than the man who is placing business or professional success
ahead of spiritual development. He will be less likely to drink
again, and
<font color="#9F0000">anything is preferable to that</font>.&quot;</i></font>

<!--------------------------------------------------------
<font face="Times,Roman">
That's also a good example of the propaganda stunt
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Argue from
Adverse Consequences</a>&quot; &#8212; argue that people <i>really must</i> do
what you want, or else really bad things will happen.
Molly-coddle Daddy and support him while he spends all of his time
with Alcoholics Anonymous, or else he might drink again.
--------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Bill Wilson did not bother to
define just what &quot;spiritual development&quot; was supposed to mean.
We can only make an educated guess, and assume that Bill meant going to
A.A. meetings, doing the Twelve Steps, and recruiting new members.
Bill did indicate that being on a &quot;firmer foundation&quot;
meant being less likely to drink again.
<p>

So Bill Wilson was really saying,
<ul>

<font color="#4f007f">
<li> &quot;If you condemn and criticize me, if you don't let me do just whatever
I want to do, if you force me to go get a job, then I just might relapse
and drink myself to death.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Anything
is preferable to that</a>.
<li> &quot;Or I may retreat further into myself and feel I have spiritual
justification for so doing.
<li> &quot;But if you let me goof off with my A.A. buddies
for the rest of my life
(and <i>Thirteenth Step</i> all of the pretty women at the meetings),
then everything will be okay.&quot;
</ul>
</font>

<p>
<a name="projection"> </a>
No wonder Bill Wilson constantly accused other people
&#8212; alcoholics and non-alcoholics alike &#8212; of being selfish,
dishonest, manipulative, under-handed,
and self-seeking. <i><b>He was talking about himself.</b></i>
In psychology, that is called &quot;projection&quot;: accusing others of
doing what he was doing wrong,
accusing others of committing the very sins and crimes that
he was committing.

<p>
And it turns out that this is standard behavior for a cult leader.
The Europe S.O.S. web site had a good description of a cult
that included
<a href="orange-cult-sos.html#projection" target="_blank">this paragraph</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A frequent tactic by cult
leaders is to divert attention from their own sins by accusing
others inside or outside their organization of the very crimes
of which they themselves are guilty.

got a lot of mileage out of threatening to relapse.

Those of us who have spent much time in the world of spiritual

<p>
Let's see... &quot;<i>Spiritual make-believe dream
world</i>&quot; has been replaced with <i>&quot;keep our heads in the clouds
with Him&quot;</i> and &quot;<i>a great sense of
purpose</i>&quot;, that is, by a different flavor of megalomania,
or delusion of grandeur: a messianic complex.<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;I have come to believe that God wants me to save the
world, He really does.&quot;</i></b><br>
</font>

And this great sense of purpose is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>accompanied by a growing consciousness of the power of
God in our lives.</i>&quot;</font>
<p>
So what's the big difference? One spiritual make-believe or
another, Tweedle-Dee or Tweedle-Dum...
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Shall I have chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla delusions of grandeur today?
Decisions, decisions...&quot;
</font>

<p>
Supposedly, God wants you to have your head in the clouds with Him, but
you have to
keep your feet where the &quot;fellow travelers&quot; are. Are
the &quot;fellow travelers&quot; the alcoholics who have not yet
been converted to the A.A. religion? Bill is indulging in vague
terminology again, making up more euphemisms, but that is
probably what he means. The phrase &quot;fellow travelers&quot;
does not appear again anywhere else in the <i>Big Book</i>, so it is
simply undefined. Typical. And that terminology,
&quot;our fellow travelers&quot;, implies that the
unsaved alcoholics are somehow already the property of A.A..

<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>And that is where our work is; we have to save all of our
fellow travelers by making them just as nutty as we are.</i>&quot;
</font>

<p>
Bill finishes by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>These are the realities for us.</b>&quot;
</font>

<p>
Hmmm... That is not necessarily reality for anybody else...
<p>

Then Bill once again reveals that, on some level of his mind,
he knows he has gone insane, but he is in deep denial about it:
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
Yes, you don't have to act crazy after having a
<a href="#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna-induced vision of God</a>.
But Bill did.
<li>
And you don't have to be
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#unemployed" target="_blank">chronically unemployed</a>
after a spiritual experience, and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">demand that your wife and the A.A. organization

And you don't have to go into an eleven-year-long bout of
<a href="#depression" target="_blank">deep crippling clinical depression</a> after a spiritual experience,

<p>
And right in the middle of it, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
Excuse me, Bill? What did you just say? &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="blue">
Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
</font>
<p>
And then Bill finished his sermon with:
<p>
<a name="hardly_fail"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions
or not, they may do well to examine the principles by which the
alcoholic member is trying to live. They can hardly fail to approve
these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails
somewhat in practicing them.
Nothing will help the man who is off on a spiritual tangent so
much as the wife who adopts a sane spiritual program, making a
better practical use of it.<br>

<p>
So now the whole family has to go join Al-Anon and do Bill Wilson's
12 guilt-inducing steps because Daddy is acting crazy. And they couldn't
possibly dislike Bill's Buchmanite religion:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;They can hardly fail to approve these simple principles...&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
(Except that the &quot;simple principles&quot; are not spiritual principles at all, they
are cult religion practices.)

<a name="jealous"> </a>
<a name="grand_boast"> </a>
Speaking of nutty attitudes about father's new sobriety, the
<i>Big Book</i> chapter &quot;To Wives&quot; also contains a couple of real jewels.
Bill wrote that absurd chapter himself (or possibly with some
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">help</a> from Joe Worth),
in spite of the conceit that it was written by the women:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As wives of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to
feel that we understand as perhaps few can.
We want to analyze mistakes we have made.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 104.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That's deceptive, to say the least.
No matter how much the wives may have understood,
and no matter how much <i>&quot;they would like you to feel&quot;</i>
that they understand as perhaps few can,
the truth is that the &quot;wives of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; did
not write a single word of that chapter.
Bill Wilson asked Dr. Bob's wife Anne to write it, but she declined.
Lois Wilson wanted to write it, and she also wanted to write the
following chapter, <i>The Family Afterwards</i>, but Bill didn't
trust her to get the &quot;style&quot; right, he said.
That is an indication of Bill's real opinion of his wife's intellect.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Bill_the_wife" target="_blank">Bill Wilson wrote those chapters
himself while pretending to be his own wife</a>,
and putting his words into her mouth. That hurt Lois' feelings, but that was
just the way it was going to be.

Bill would not let even Lois, who was dying to do so, write the chapter
titled &quot;To Wives.&quot;
After all, she was the wife who had endured Bill's drunken years and the
houseful of alcoholics he was trying to wrestle into sobriety.
&quot;I have never known why he didn't want me to write about the wives,
and it hurt me at first,&quot; she said.<br>

Bill Wilson constantly hurt Lois Wilson, both before and after sobriety,
what with his screaming temper tantrums, arrogant, inconsiderate behavior, philandering, and
demanding that she work to support him.
One evening, Lois Wilson exploded in anger when Bill Wilson wanted her to go to yet
another Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. She screamed, &quot;Damn your old meetings!&quot; and threw
a shoe at him.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt26">26</a></sup></font>
Lois Wilson's attitude was simply not acceptable to Bill Wilson. He couldn't have that.
So Bill made up an explanation for Lois's anger where he had the imaginary wives saying:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another feeling we are very likely to entertain is one of
resentment that love and loyalty could not cure our husbands of
alcoholism. We do not like the thought that the contents of a
book or the work of another alcoholic has
accomplished in a few weeks that for which we struggled for
years.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson,
present in all editions of the book,
from the 1939 multilithed manuscript through the 4th Edition, on page 118.</font>

<p>
Bill's imagination was vivid: Even while Bill was
still busy just writing the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i> in late 1938 and early 1939,
he was describing wives who were jealous of the book because the
book had already cured their husbands of alcoholism <i>in just a few weeks</i>.
There's nothing like being confident that your book is going
to revolutionize the world, and have <i>magical</i>, nay,
<i><b>miraculous</b></i> effects on alcoholics.
<p>
That's delusions of grandeur, again. It's also characteristic of a
narcissistic personality disorder.<br>
(The real question is, <i>&quot;Was Bill Wilson
totally disconnected from reality, or was he just lying
and manufacturing propaganda?&quot;</i>)

<p>
An interesting statement on page 139 of the same book
is that Grandiose delusions can be seen in
substance-abuse disorders.
That makes sense &#8212; if you damage your brain with enough drugs
and alcohol, you will go insane.
Bill had two possibilities there: first off,
the obvious immense alcohol abuse.
And second, the repeated use of an extremely toxic hallucinogen,
a mixture
of <a href="#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna and henbane</a> (during his four
stays at the Charles B. Towns Hospital in New York).
<p>

<p>

That description of delusions of grandeur fits Bill Wilson
so well that it is uncanny:
<p>
<ol>
<li> He expected future admiration and acknowledgement as a
leader of mankind, and he didn't even wait for the future.
He was such a megalomaniac that
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">he went on
speaking tours for years</a>, breaking his anonymity, grandstanding,
and getting his picture in the newspapers.
<a href="orange-Bill_Senate.html" target="_blank">He even testified before Congress</a>,
declaring himself to be the leader and co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous.
(To Bill Wilson, &quot;anonymous&quot; meant that everybody else had to be
nameless and selfless and
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Parkhurst_cheated" target="_blank">get none of the credit</a>.)
<p>
<li> He became the leader of a religious cult.
<p>
<li> He had a messianic complex. He felt that he was chosen by God for
a special mission &#8212; to save all of the alcoholics in the world.
<p>
<li> He became a fanatical preacher and started organizing
home churches right after he flipped out on belladonna and &quot;saw God&quot;.
<p>
<li> He thought that he had discovered a new, original, cure for alcoholism &#8212; religion.
<p>
<li> He thought that he had a special relationship with God.
<p>
<li> He had an immensely inflated idea of his own importance.
<p>
<li> Apart from his delusions, Bill's behavior was not obviously odd or bizarre.
At first glance, Bill appeared to be relatively normal.
But if you started talking about alcoholism, or God, or religion, or
Bill Wilson's place in the Universe, then you would realize
that he was totally Looney-Tunes.

There is room for debate in the diagnosis of Bill Wilson's
mental problems. I have heard others describe Wilson as probably
having a bipolar or manic-depressive disorder. It seems that
those cases can be grandiose during the manic phase of their disorder.
<p>

There is also the question of &quot;when?&quot; In
the early days, between 1934 and 1938, Bill seems to have simply
had delusions of grandeur or a narcissistic personality disorder.
But from the early 1940s to the mid
1950s, Bill also suffered from deep, crippling, clinical depression or
an intense manic-depressive disorder.
The one characteristic that Bill Wilson had that does not match
the diagnosis of delusions of grandeur is the depression.
Then, by the late 1950s, Bill seems to have recovered from most of
his depression, but not the rest of his signs of mental illness.
<p>

<a name="Narcissistic"> </a>
Another very likely diagnosis of Bill Wilson's mental problems
is <i>Narcissistic Personality Disorder</i>, of which Bill Wilson was
also <a href="#Lowen" target="_blank">a textbook case</a>.
It has the following characteristics:

<h2>301.81 Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2>
<p>
<h3>Diagnostic Criteria</h3>
<p>

A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for
admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and
present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of
the following: 
<p>
<ol>

<li> has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates
achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior
without commensurate achievements) 
<li> is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power,
brilliance, beauty, or ideal love 
<li> believes that he or she is &quot;special&quot; and unique and can only
be understood by, or should associate with, other special or
high-status people (or institutions)
<li> requires excessive admiration
<a name="entitled"> </a>
<li> has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations
of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his
or her expectations 
<li> is interpersonally exploitative, i.e.,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#screw_Hank" target="_blank">takes advantage of others
to achieve his or her own ends</a>
<li> lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the
feelings and needs of others 
<li> is often envious of others or believes that others are envious
of him or her 
<li> shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes 
</ol>
<p>
<a name="defiant_counter_attack" target="_blank"> </a>
<h3>Associated Features</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with Narcissistic
Personality Disorder very sensitive to &quot;injury&quot; from criticism or
defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly,
<a href="#Bills_AlAnon" target="_blank">criticism may haunt
these individuals</a> and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded,
hollow and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant
counterattack. Such experiences often lead to social withdrawal or
an appearance of humility that may mask and protect the grandiosity.
<li> Interpersonal relations are typically impaired due to problems
derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative
disregard for the sensitivities of others.
<li> Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to
high achievement, performance may be disrupted due to intolerance
of criticism or defeat.
<li> Sometimes vocational functioning can be very low, reflecting
an unwillingness to take a risk in competitive or other situations
where defeat is possible.
<li> Sustained feelings of shame or humiliation and the attendant
self-criticism may be associated with social withdrawal,
depressed mood, and Dysthymic or Major Depressive Disorder.
In contrast, sustained periods of grandiosity may be associated
with a hypomanic mood.
<li>
Narcissistic Personality Disorder is also associated with Anorexia
Nervosa and Substance-Related Disorders (especially related to
cocaine).
<li> Histrionic, Borderline, Antisocial, and Paranoid Personality
Disorders may be associated with Narcissistic Personality
Disorder.

</ul>
<p>

<p>
<h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
<p>

Histrionic Personality Disorder; Antisocial Personality Disorder;
Borderline Personality Disorder;
Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder; Schizotypal Personality
Disorder; Paranoid Personality Disorder;
Manic Episodes; Hypomanic Episodes; Personality Change Due to a
General Medical Condition; symptoms that
may develop in association with chronic substance use.<br>

Again, that description matches Bill Wilson so well that it sounds like
it was written about him:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Bill had a grandiose sense of self-importance, and exaggerated his
achievements and talents, and expected to be recognized as superior
without commensurate achievements, like
<a href="#denied_recovery" target="_blank">his belief that he was essential
to other alcoholics' recovery</a>, and his
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">wildly exaggerated claims of
success in drying out alcoholics</a>, and his years-long nationwide tours,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">grandstanding and promoting his own legend</a>.
<p>
<li> Bill was preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power,
brilliance, beauty, or ideal love, like the Oxford Groups'
<i>&quot;Absolute Purity, Absolute Honesty, Absolute Love, and
Absolute Unselfishness&quot;</i>. Bill also liked to imagine that he was launching
a movement that would sweep the entire world and save all of the alcoholics.
Bill even claimed that A.A. was &quot;the miracle of the century&quot;, and
&quot;<a href="#greatest_of_all_time" target="_blank">probably one of the greatest medical
and spiritual developments of all time</a>.&quot;

<p>
<li> Bill believed that he was &quot;special&quot; and unique &#8212; the only man
in the world with the answer to alcoholism (or, before that, the first American
to make a working boomerang, or
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#calculus_prof" target="_blank">the only man on campus
to truly understand calculus</a>).
Bill thought that he understood God, alcoholics, and alcoholism better
than anybody else in the whole world.
<p>
<li> Bill required excessive admiration.
<p>
<li> Bill certainly had a sense of entitlement, and felt that he deserved
the best of everything, like
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">all of fame, credit, and prestige</a>,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">all of the money</a>, and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">all of the women</a>, and even a house in the
country and a Cadillac car supplied by the A.A. organization.
Bill also felt entitled to
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#concrete_terms" target="_blank">dictate the terms</a>
of other people's recovery from alcoholism, and even to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">dictate their religious beliefs</a>.
<p>
<li> Bill Wilson was outrageously, heartlessly exploitative. He used everybody,
and he discarded and drove away people when they refused to kowtow to him.
<p>
<li> Bill Wilson lacked empathy &#8212; he didn't even think about the
welfare or recovery of
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">the women alcoholics whom he was
thirteenth-stepping</a>,
and he disregarded the recovery of
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">the unbelievers whom he drove away from A.A.</a>.
And Bill even disregarded the feelings of his own wife Lois while she
supported him for years.
<p>
<li> Envy of other people seems to be the only characteristic of narcissism
that Bill Wilson did not overtly display, but I think that he was envious.
Bill spent his whole life trying to prove that he was just as good as
other people. He must have felt envious of those other people who were born with
a higher status than him, and who were never cursed with alcoholism, whose
honor and morality were never questioned.
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Note that the APA dropped this &quot;Envy&quot; item from the list of signs of NPD in the next edition of the DSM.
They regarded the envy item as too weakly correlated to be a sure sign of NPD.
</font>

<p>
<li> Bill certainly showed arrogant, haughty behaviors and attitudes.
<p>
<li> Bill strongly displayed &quot;Vulnerability in self-esteem&quot;.
He couldn't stand criticism. He lashed out in defiant counter-attack
whenever he was criticized, as shown in the cases of
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good" target="_blank">his wife</a>,
his
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#calculus_prof" target="_blank">calculus professor</a>,
his business partner
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst" target="_blank">Henry Parkhurst</a>, and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">Ed the atheist who
dared to challenge Bill's bombastic religiosity</a>.

When Bill was criticized,
<a href="#Bills_AlAnon" target="_blank">he often nursed a bitter resentment over it for
years</a>, until he could get his revenge, or he went into a fit of deep
depression that often lasted years.
<p>
<li> Bill's interpersonal relations were very impaired due to <i>&quot;problems
derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative
disregard for the sensitivities of others&quot;</i>.
Bill fought with everybody from his wife to
his best friend and partner Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">the A.A. members who wouldn't
believe in God as Bill dictated</a>. Loud screaming matches were routine behavior for
Bill Wilson.

<p>
<a name="depression4"> </a>
<a name="depressive_disorder"> </a>
<li> And Bill certainly suffered from &quot;Major Depressive Disorders&quot;:
<ul>
<li> A one-year-long depression in his childhood when his parents divorced
and his mother left Bill and his sister with his grandparents.
<li> A three-year-long depression when his high-school girlfriend died.
<li> Various sporadic depressions throughout his drinking career.
<li> Then, while sober, an eleven-year-long deep, crippling, clinical
depression from 1944 to 1955, from indeterminate causes.
</ul>
</ol>

<p>
And
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Lowen2" target="_blank">Dr. Alexander Lowen</a> added
one more characteristic of narcissism:

This problem of several possible diagnoses is not unusual.

<b>Limitations of the Categorical Approach</b>
</font>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
DSM-IV is a categorical classification that divides mental
disorders into types based on criteria sets with defining features.
This naming of categories is the traditional method of organizing and transmitting
information in everyday life and has been the fundamental
approach used in all systems of medical diagnosis. A
categorical approach to classification works best 
when all members of a diagnostic class are
homogeneous, when there are clear boundaries between classes, and when the
different classes are mutually exclusive. Nonetheless, the limitations
of the categorical classification system must be recognized.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In DSM-IV, there is no assumption that each category of mental
disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries
dividing it from other mental disorders or from no mental disorder.
There is also no assumption that all individuals described as having
the same mental disorder are alike in all important ways. The
clinician using DSM-IV should therefore consider that individuals
sharing a diagnosis are likely to be heterogeneous even in regard
to the defining
features of the diagnosis and that boundary cases will be difficult
to diagnose in any but a probabilistic fashion. This outlook allows
greater flexibility in the use of the system, encourages more
specific attention to boundary cases, and emphasizes the need to
capture additional clinical information that goes beyond diagnosis.
In recognition of the heterogeneity of clinical presentations,
DSM-IV often includes polythetic criteria sets, in which the individual
need only present with a subset of items from a longer list (e.g.,
the diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder requires only
five out of nine items.)<br>

So, basically, just call them whatever they most closely resemble.
<p>
We have plenty of &quot;wiggle room&quot; for debating the
various diagnoses for Bill Wilson, but one thing is certain:
Bill was nuts.

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="Tiebout_diagnosis"> </a>
Ernest Kurtz and Robert Thomsen reported in their books
that the psychiatrist
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a> diagnosed
Bill Wilson as grandiose and immature:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In the mid-1940s, Wilson had sought out Dr. Harry M. Tiebout and had
entered upon a regime of psychotherapy. Dr. Tiebout, a psychiatrist
specializing in the treatment of alcoholics, from early on had
supported Alcoholics Anonymous and had referred to the fellowship
its first successful female member, Marty Mann. Throughout his long
and distinguished career, the Connecticut psychiatrist published
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Tiebout_papers" target="_blank">a series of perceptive
analyses</a> of alcoholism and of the therapeutic
dynamic inherent in the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. Tiebout
came to this comprehension largely through his knowledge of Bill
Wilson, and his diagnostic understanding was both profound and
simple. Drawing upon a phrase attributed to Freud, the psychiatrist
pointed out to A.A.'s co-founder that both in his active alcoholism
and in his current sobriety, he had been trying to live out the
infantilely grandiose demands of &quot;His Majesty the
Baby.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>50</sup></font><br>
<hr>

the theme recurs throughout Wilson's correspondence...<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="12X12q17"> </a>
Alas, Bill Wilson just projected that diagnosis onto all of the other alcoholics
around him, and claimed that they were all just as bad as him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When A.A. was quite young, a number of eminent psychologists and doctors
made an exhaustive study of a good-sized group of so-called problem
drinkers. The doctors weren't trying to find how different we were
from one another; they sought to find whatever personality traits, if
any, this group of alcoholics had in common. They finally came up with
a conclusion that shocked the A.A. members of that time.
These distinguished men had the nerve to say that most of the alcoholics
under investigation were still childish, emotionally sensitive,
and grandiose.<br>

How we alcoholics did resent that verdict!<br>

(Notice how Bill Wilson was using
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#preachers_we" target="_blank">The Preacher's We</a></i>
propaganda trick once again, saying
<i>&quot;Oh, us stupid alcoholics &#8212; we are all so immature and grandiose

I strongly disagree with Kurtz's statement that
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Tiebout_papers" target="_blank">Tiebout's papers</a>
were &quot;a series of perceptive
analyses of alcoholism&quot;. Tiebout's papers were simplistic, sadistic, 
and insane.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Tiebout's answer to alcoholism was just to &quot;make the patients
surrender.&quot;
<p>
<li> Nowhere in Tiebout's papers do we find anything like instructions
to heal the patients, to build them up, to restore their sanity and
confidence, and empower them and enable them to live sane, happy lives
after getting sober.
<p>
<li> Nowhere do we find Tiebout treating his patients with respect.
He described alcoholics just the same way as Bill Wilson did:
with contempt and negative stereotypes that declare that they are
all just pompous, egotistical fools with grandiose, &quot;strutting-peacock&quot;
egos that need to be &quot;deflated&quot; and &quot;cut down to size.&quot;
<p>
<li> Tiebout never treated his patients as adults who were
responsible for their own lives or deaths, which they really are,
in the end &#8212; the patients will either live or die by their own hands.
<p>
<li> Tiebout's answer was always &quot;Just make them surrender.&quot;
<p>
<li> Tiebout forgot the first rule of the Hippocratic Oath:<br>

<b><i>Do No Harm.</i></b>
</font>

</ul>

<p>
Also note the careful cover-up contained in Kurtz's description of
Marty Mann as &quot;its first successful female member&quot;.
What Kurtz isn't saying is that there were other, earlier, female
members of A.A., like
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#woman_stay" target="_blank">Florence Rankin, who wrote the story
<i>&quot;A Feminine Victory&quot;</i> for the <i>Big Book</i> first edition</a>.
And there was Jane Sturdevant, who was the first woman in Dr. Bob's group in 
Akron. But those other women weren't
&quot;successful&quot;. They relapsed and died drunk, in spite
of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson, and his Twelve Steps.
(So they became A.A. non-persons.)
<p>
Nevertheless, in the background, I can still hear the chorus chanting,<br>

They would not know how to get well? They would not be able to figure out how
to quit drinking without Bill Wilson telling them? Nobody else in the whole
world knows how to quit drinking but Bill Wilson, and without him, the other
alcoholics will all just die?
<p>

Remember, this happened in the spring of 1935, when Bill Wilson had only
five months of sobriety, and he had not founded Alcoholics Anonymous
yet, nor had he even met Doctor Robert Smith yet &#8212; he would meet Dr. Bob
the next day.
And Bill had not helped a single alcoholic to quit drinking.
Not one. He had been trying to recruit more
alcoholics for Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult, but had totally
failed with
every last one of them, because he drove them away with his fanatical
preaching. Bill had not gotten the Oxford Group a single new member, and
the Oxford Group regarded Bill Wilson as a real loser.
Yet Bill thought that he was so important that &quot;the
other alcoholics&quot; would die if he drank again.
<p>
That is delusions of grandeur. And it's also characteristic of a
narcissistic personality disorder.
<p>
<a name="TIME">
Bill Wilson said pretty much the same thing again, later.
<i><b>TIME</b></i> magazine wanted to do a cover story on Bill and
A.A., but Bill refused, believing that
he should maintain at least some small pretense of anonymity.
(Bill was already &quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">the
most famous 'anonymous' person in the U.S.A.</a>&quot; because of
all of his speaking tours and constantly breaking his anonymity and getting his
picture and his story printed in the newspapers again and again.) Bill worried that
his failure to grandstand even just that one single time had
fatal consequences for many alcoholics, and he tried to guesstimate how
many alcoholics had had to pay the terrible price of Bill Wilson's modesty:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For all I know, a piece of this sort could have brought
A.A. a thousand members &#8212; possibly a lot more.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, when I turned that article down,
I denied recovery to an awful lot of 
alcoholics &#8212; some of these may already be dead. And practically
all the rest of them,
we may suppose, are still sick and suffering.
Therefore, in a sense,
<font color="#9F0000">
my action has pronounced the death sentence
on some drunks</font>
and condemned others to a much longer period of illness.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, Bill later bragged about how he had preserved his anonymity
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">(which he didn't)</a>
with these words:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

signing my name to it. I even thought of calling A.A. &quot;the Wilson

that you and thousands of others might not be alive today.</font>

<p>
For Bill Wilson to claim that thousands of alcoholics would have died
if he had broken his anonymity is absurd.
Bill Wilson broke his anonymity hundreds of times, and spent years
constantly touring the USA, proselytizing and promoting his new
Alcoholics Anonymous organization, and getting his picture and his story
printed in the newspapers, and that
doesn't seem to have caused thousands of alcoholics to have died.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Notice how, in Bill Wilson's demented mind, he had thousands of alcoholics
dying either way: Thousands of alcoholics supposedly died because Bill
didn't indulge in self-aggrandizement and get his picture printed on the
cover of <i>TIME</i> magazine, and thousands of alcoholics would have
died if Bill had broken his anonymity. Those poor alcoholics just can't win.
</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson's immensely inflated opinion of his own importance to
other alcoholics is clear evidence of delusions of grandeur.
Bill didn't &#8212; just couldn't &#8212; admit even the slightest
possibility that those other alcoholics could probably find some
other way to quit drinking and recover anyway, if they really wanted to,
without Bill Wilson and his great teachings (Buchmanism) being
the center of their lives. No, Bill Wilson declared that he was
condemning those unfortunate alcoholics to death by depriving them of
knowledge of his magnificent program.

<p>
Remember that the Harvard Medical School says that more than 50% of
all alcoholics eventually quit drinking, and 80 percent of those
successful quitters
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment" target="_blank">quit drinking without A.A.</a>,
the Twelve Steps, or even any treatment or support group of any kind.
They save themselves, alone, on their own, without Bill Wilson or his followers.
<p>
Likewise, the NIAAA's 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related

they do anything else?&quot;<br>

<h2>Off-loading Blame</h2>
If your partner has a Manipulative DNP [Destructive Narcissistic Personality],
you are likely to be accustomed
to [his] tendency to off-load blame, and many times you are the recipient
of the blame. It doesn't matter how big or small the offense is, your
partner never accepts responsibility for mistakes as errors. Worse, you
may be blamed for things that are not your fault or are not under your
control.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This tendency to off-load blame is a manifestation of the inflated self.
Your partner feels that [he] can do no wrong and is superior. Other words

The <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>
(<a href="#dsm3" target="_blank">DSM-III-R</a> and <a href="#dsm4" target="_blank">DSM-IV</a>)
states that the patient with
grandiose delusions may believe that he
has made some great and important discovery.
That fits Bill Wilson exactly. He was sure that he had discovered
something extremely important, a brand new way for alcoholics
to quit drinking &#8212; become a religious maniac.
Bill even wrote of his first three converts in Akron:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
<b>&quot;Their discovery,&quot;</b> which really meant
<b>&quot;Bill's discovery.&quot;</b><br>
(Note too, how Bill Wilson was
again <a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html#hiding_behind" target="_blank">hiding behind
other people</a>, masking his monumental egotism by calling it
&quot;their discovery&quot;.)
<p>

Bill Wilson imagined that his &quot;great discovery&quot; was brand new and original.
He didn't seem to be able to remember &#8212; or else he conveniently forgot &#8212;
the fact that Oxford
Group members, Ebby Thacher and Rowland Hazard in particular,
had taught the same thing to him &#8212; that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung" target="_blank">the cure for alcoholism was
to turn into a religiomaniac</a>.
Bill forgot that they made him into the religious maniac that he was
by attacking his mind and indoctrinating him while
he was detoxing in Towns' Hospital and
<a href="#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">completely out of his head
from alcohol withdrawal and hallucinogenic drugs</a>.
<p>
Bill also apparently forgot the fact that there had been
<b>many</b> earlier temperance movements, and a lot of them
had used religion as a big part of their program.
They had even contributed some colorful phrases to our language,
like &quot;taking the pledge&quot; and &quot;falling off of
the wagon.&quot;

In his history of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It was on a November day in that year [1937] when Dr. Bob and I sat in his living room,
counting the noses of our recoveries.
There had been failures galore, but now we could see some startling successes too.
A hard core of very grim, last-gasp cases had by then been sober a couple of years,
an unheard-of development.
There were twenty or more such people.
All told we figured that upwards of forty alcoholics were staying
bone dry.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As we carefully rechecked this score, it suddenly burst upon us that a
new light was shining into the dark world of the alcoholic. Despite the
fact that
<a href="orange-letters10.html#Ebby" target="_blank">Ebby had slipped</a>,
a benign chain reaction, one alcoholic carrying
the good news to the next, had started outward from Doctor Bob and me.
Conceivably it could one day circle the whole world. What a tremendous thing
that realization was! At last we were sure. There would be no more flying totally
blind. We actually wept for joy, and Bob and Anne and I bowed our heads
in silent thanks.<br>

So, after two years of intense full-time recruiting work, including

only those alcoholics who were ready to quit drinking,
Bill and Bob counted 40 ex-drinkers in their club (who had anything from two years
down to a few days of sobriety).
On the basis of that, Bill Wilson concluded that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery" target="_blank">he had discovered
a new cure for alcoholism</a>.


<p>
<a name="temperance_unions"> </a>
<a name="Hundred_Men"> </a>
Bill restated this &quot;great discovery&quot; theme in the prospectus
for shares of &quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;,
which was formed to write and publish the <i>Big Book</i>
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In all, about two hundred cases of hopeless alcoholism have 
been dealt with. As will be seen,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">about fifty percent of

<font size="-1"><a href="orange-prospectus.html#unprecedented" target="_blank">

<p>
That was, of course, completely untrue (which also made it a case of felony

giving false and deceptive information on a stock prospectus).
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The A.A. success rate</a> was nowhere
near fifty percent (Bill and Dr. Bob calculated that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">it was five percent</a>),
and great numbers of people had quit drinking before Bill started Alcoholics Anonymous.
People had been quitting drinking ever since the Egyptians
invented beer 5000 years earlier. Very recently, there had been the
countless tens and hundreds of thousands of drinkers who had joined the
Women's Christian Temperance Union, and gotten Prohibition passed, and
before them, there had been perhaps five or six hundred thousands who
had joined the Washingtonian Movement.

The diagnosis of drunkenness was that it was a disease for which the
patient was in no way responsible, that it was created by existing saloons,
and non-existing bright hearths, smiling wives, pretty caps and aprons.
The cure was the patent nostrum of pledge-signing, a lying-made-easy
invention, which like calomel, seldom had any permanent effect on the
disease for which it was given, and never failed to produce another and
a worse. Here the care created an epidemic of forgery, falsehood and

Jerry McCauley was a self-described &quot;counterfeiter's son, a runaway,
a thief, a drunkard, a brawler, and a convict&quot; who experienced
three dramatic religious experiences that converted him into a
Christian believer. He opened the Water Street Mission in New York
in 1872. It advertised &quot;Everybody welcome, especially drunkards&quot;,
and offered the derelict alcoholics respect and compassion rather than
condescension and contempt. The religious meetings there were short on
sermons and long on personal stories, and sounded just like the second
half of an Alcoholics Anonymous
meeting:<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt10">10</a></sup></font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... the heart of the meeting was not McAuley, but the &quot;testimonies&quot;
of the participants.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One after another they spoke of their fall and their rebirth, or of their
need for hope and change. The only structure to this &quot;experience sharing&quot;
(to remind the reader of the Washingtonian parallel)
was McAuley's time limit of one minute per speaker. He even used a bell to rein
in the long-winded speaker. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
While some religious institutions had made superficial overtures to drunkards,
prostitutes, thieves, and the homeless, McAuley's Water Street Mission was
the first institution that opened its doors day and night to truly welcome
those branded as social outcasts. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
There is some evidence that McAuley's demonstration that the alcoholic could
be reformed by religious conversion also contributed to the founding of the
New York Christian Home for Intemperate Men in 1877.<br>

[Salvation Army Founder William] Booth declared in 1890 that
<font color="blue">
alcoholism was &quot;a disease often inherited, always developed by
indulgence, but as clearly a disease as opthalmia or stone.&quot;
</font>

His plan for bringing salvation to the alcoholic
involved attracting him with food and shelter, then providing stability
through temporary employment; and finally transferring him to rural colonies,
where he would learn the values of sobriety and responsibility. The vision
was that Christian salvation and moral education in a wholesome environment
would save the body and soul of the alcoholic.
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Salvation Army workers began street outreach with alcoholics as early as 1891.
&nbsp; ...

Although the SA offered no specialized treatment services,
alcoholics made up a large portion of the clientele when the SA's first &quot;Cheap
Food and Shelter Depot&quot; opened in 1891 in New York City.

By 1900 there were more than 700 corps of the Salvation Army scattered across
America's cities.<br>

And the Emmanuel Clinic and the Lay Therapy Movement was a ready-made prescription
for Alcoholics Anonymous:<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt11">11</a></sup></font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In 1906, the Rev. Drs. Elwood Worcester and Samuel McComb, along with
physician Dr. Isador Coriat, opened a clinic in the Emmanuel Church in
Boston, that, for 23 years, integrated religion, medicine, and psychology
in the treatment of various disorders.
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Jacoby club, started by Ernest Jacoby in 1910, provided formal support
meetings and social events for alcoholics in treatment. Its motto was
&quot;A club for men to help themselves by helping others.&quot;
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is much in the Emmanuel Clinic that influenced the future of
alcoholism treatment. Its integration of psychology and religion
foreshadows the current use of spirituality in addiction treatment.
It was the first outpatient alcoholism clinic whose primary methods were
those of psychological counselling. Its focus on self-inventory and confession
foreshadowed the Oxford Groups and Alcoholics Anonymous. The use of
&quot;friendly visitors&quot; and &quot;lay therapists&quot; foreshadowed
A.A.'s Twelfth Step and system of sponsorship, the emergence of the
professional role of the alcoholism counselor, and the more recent role
of the case manager. Elements of the methods developed at the Emmanuel
Clinic were incorporated into the mid-century development of outpatient
alcoholism counselling clinics.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the more historically significant contributions of the Emmanuel
Clinic was the use of recovered alcoholics as what came to be called
&quot;lay therapists&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
References to the &quot;lay therapy movement&quot; spawned at this Clinic
generally indicated both the people who were providing the therapy &#8212;
recovered alcoholics without formal training as psychiatrists,
psychologists or social workers &#8212; and the kind of therapy that was being
provided...<br>

Bill Wilson liked to claim that the disease theory of alcoholism began with
Bill's doctor, Dr. William D. Silkworth, and that Alcoholics Anonymous was the
first organization to promote this enlightened new approach to alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Bill listened, entranced, as Silkworth explained his theory. For the first
time in his life, Bill was hearing about alcoholism not as a lack of willpower,
not as a moral defect, but as a legitimate illness. It was Dr. Silkworth's theory
&#8212; unique at the time &#8212; that alcoholism was the combination of this mysterious
pysical &quot;allergy&quot; and the compulsion to drink; that alcoholism could no more
be &quot;defeated&quot; by willpower than could tuberculosis. Bill's relief was immense.<br>

Silkworth's disease theory was obviously not new or unique.
In fact, the idea was even common in the Oxford Group cult, of which Bill Wilson

Beverly Nichols described the ideal Oxford Group wife of an alcoholic
this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...an absolutely unselfish wife must endure, year in and year out, the
persecution of a drunkard. She must never assert herself, never speak harshly to him,
never protest when he revolts her sensibilities, terrifies her children, turns her
house into a lunatic asylum, gambles away her money.
<font color="blue">
'It is not <i>him</i>,' she must say. 'It is a disease.'</font>
Or again: 'I took him for better or for worse; I must
endure to the end.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such women exist by the thousand; the Oxford Group approves of them; I do not.
They are magnificent but mad.
Unselfishness, if carried to these extremes, is an obsession that does nothing
but prolong unnecessary pain. (Read Stefan Zweig's <i>Beware of Pity</i>.)<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>All I Could Never Be</i>, Beverly Nichols, pages 262-266.

</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>(The resemblance of the Oxford Group to the Alcoholics Anonymous
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">wives' auxiliary, Al-Anon</a>,
is unmistakeable.)</i>
</font>

<p>
<font color="black">
Note that Beverly Nichols was describing the situation in the Oxford Group back in the
nineteen-twenties and -thirties.
The excuse that alcoholism is a disease was already common then.
The disease concept of alcoholism did not originate with Bill Wilson, Alcoholics Anonymous, or
Dr. William D. Silkworth, either.
Dr. Benjamin Rush advanced the idea in 1784, in his
<i>Inquiry into the Effects of Ardent Spirits on the Human Mind and Body</i>, where he
designated addiction to spirits as a &quot;disease of the will&quot;.
There was a counterpart in Britain: the Edinburgh physician Thomas
Trotter wrote in his doctoral dissertation, <i>An essay, medical,
philosophical and chemical on drunkenness</i>, submitted in 1788 and
published version in 1804, that &quot;In medical language, I consider
drunkennes to be a disease...&quot; He also wrote that &quot;the habit of
drunkennes is a disease of the mind&quot;.

Bill Wilson did not invent or discover anything when
he created the A.A. cult; he just copied the Oxford Group (which in turn had
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Wrights_material" target="_blank">copied
most of its material and practices from earlier characters like Henry B. Wright
of Yale University</a>).
</font>

<p>
Every single important feature of the Alcoholics Anonymous program was
already commonplace in one or more of the numerous temperance movements,
alcoholism treatment programs, or
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">cult religions</a> that existed before A.A.,
and yet Bill Wilson bombastically declared that his &quot;spiritual&quot;
method of recovery was something completely new and original:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li>
<i>&quot;These men had found something brand new in life.&quot;</i><br>
<li>
<i>&quot;...this is probably one of the greatest medical and spiritual
developments of all time.&quot;</i><br>
<li>
[A.A. is] <i>&quot;the miracle of the century.&quot;</i><br>
<li>
<i>&quot; ... about fifty percent of these [alcoholics] have recovered. This, of course,
is unprecedented &#8212; never has such a thing happened before.&quot;</i><br>

<center>
<table width="95%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" border="4">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

(Bill Wilson was, of course, also
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">grossly exaggerating
the A.A. success rate</a>, overstating it
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">by at least a factor of 10</a>.
</i></font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
And many of Bill Wilson's advertised success stories relapsed and disappeared &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">half of the
original <i>Big Book</i> authors</a> returned to drinking &#8212;
so, in the end, Bill's &quot;new <i>spiritual</i> program&quot; had
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">no greater
a success rate</a> than the various temperance movements that had come before it.
But Bill Wilson was deluded and crazy enough to believe &#8212; or narcissistic and
dishonest enough to claim &#8212; that
he was the first person in the history of the human race to
discover quitting drinking, the first crusader to sober up a
few drunks with religion, and if he didn't personally save all of
the alcoholics, then they would all die.

Bill Wilson could not possibly have been ignorant of the earlier history
of the Temperance Movement. Bill Wilson talked about the Washingtonian Society
in his book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Washingtonian Society, a movement among alcoholics which started in
Baltimore a century ago, almost discovered the answer to alcoholism. At first,
the society was composed entirely of alcoholics trying to help one another.
The early members foresaw that they should dedicate themselves to this sole aim.
In many respects, the Washingtonians were akin to A.A. of today. Their membership
passed the hundred thousand mark. Had they been left to themselves, and stuck to
their one goal, they might have found the rest of the answer.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 178.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Note how Bill Wilson wrote of &quot;the answer to alcoholism&quot; as if there were one
single one-size-fits-all cure for alcoholism. And of course Bill imagined that
he knew &quot;the rest of the answer&quot; that his predecessors had failed to discover.)
</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson often repeated the story about how,
while he was in Towns' Hospital (December 11 to 14, 1934), after his
belladonna-induced &quot;hot flash&quot; where he &quot;saw God&quot;, one of his friends,
either Ebby Thacher or Rowland Hazard (Bill couldn't remember which it was),
brought Bill a copy of William James' book <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>
to read. Bill said that reading the book was tough going, but he got through
it while he was in the hospital.
It was reading <i>Varieties</i> that led Bill to believe that he had
had a religious experience (which he later renamed to a &quot;spiritual&quot;
experience).
<p>
<a name="ftnt17_ret"> </a>
<a name="Varieties_quote"> </a>
<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> contains many stories of
alcoholics being cured of alcoholism by religious conversion (throughout pages 198 to 263):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Before embarking on the general natural history of the regenerate character,
let me convince you of this curious fact by one or two examples.
The most numerous are those of reformed drunkards. You recollect the case
of Mr. Hadley in the last lecture; the Jerry McAuley Water Street Mission abounds
in similar instances.<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>
You also remember the graduate of Oxford, converted at three in the afternoon,
and getting drunk in the hay-field the next day, but after that permanently cured
of his appetite. &quot;From that hour drink has had no terrors for me:
I never touch it, never want it. The same thing occurred with my pipe... the desire
for it went at once and has never returned. So with every known sin, the
deliverance in each case being permanent and complete. I have had no
temptations since conversion.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Note that Bill Wilson erroneously attributed the quote
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;The only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania&quot;
</font>
to Carl Jung, but it obviously predates
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland" target="_blank">
Rowland Hazard's communication with
Jung</a>, because William James published <i>Varieties</i> in 1902. Bill Pittman
reported that Jung and James met in
1909,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt17">17</a></sup></font>
so if Jung ever said it, he probably got it from James. And it's understandable
that Bill couldn't remember where he read that quote &#8212; he was detoxing and tripping
on hallucinogenic drugs when he read <i>Varieties</i>.)

Alcoholics Anonymous is often called the &quot;father&quot; of the
self-help movement for heavy drinkers in the United States.
It isn't. A.A. may be considered a distant descendant of the Washingtonian Society,
a temperance group that flourished in the 1840s and 1850s.
A.A. is linked by a visible thread to that Society, an organization rooted
in Pietist and Protestant evangelical thought. Bill Wilson, aware of
the Washingtonian experiment, was influenced by it and disenchanted with it.
He encouraged members of A.A. to avoid the four major flaws that he
perceived in the Washingtonians: 1) a policy of self-promotion through
advertising; 2) exhibitionism to the point of grandiosity, coupled with
a competitive stance and an unwillingness to cooperate with other
organizations in their field;
3) the dissipation of effort in fruitless controversy and divergent aims
(such as the abolitionist movement); and 4) &quot;Refusal to stick to
their original purpose and so refrain from fighting anybody.&quot;
(Some tenets of A.A. &#8212; though not certain of A.A.'s current positions
and practices &#8212; clearly reflect these reactions to the
Washingtonians.)<font size="-1"><sup>18</sup></font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus, the relationship of A.A. to the Washingtonian Society, although
something of a historical accident, is one that involves a similarity
of purpose but a contrast of method. Despite Wilson's claim (In <i>A.A. Comes
of Age</i>) that he knew little about the Washingtonians, the fact is
that he knew quite a bit about them, as indicated above.<br>
<!-- A.A. shared
with the Washingtonians a common religious core of thought, but the
two groups used different methods to carry that thought to the heavy
drinkers of their respective periods. -->
<hr>
18. Ernest Kurtz details this issue on pp. 116-117 of <i>Not-God</i>,
and refers to Wilson's <i>Grapevine</i> article (AAGV 2:3, August, 1945,
published one year before the publication of the Traditions.
In that article, Wilson listed the four &quot;flaws&quot; of the
Washingtonian Society, that is, differences in approach and
procedure, from that which he envisioned for a still nascent A.A.
<i>The Grapevine</i> carried 12 articles on the Washingtonian Society
between 1945 and 1976.

Kurtz reports (p. 292), &quot;Further, the
Washingtonians have been kept before A.A.'s attention over these
years by Professor Milton Maxwell, currently an A.A. trustee, whose
deepest scholarly treatment appeared as 'The Washingtonian Movement,'
QJSA [<i>Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol</i>], Vol. 11,
pp. 410-451 (1950).&quot;
The result of A.A.'s early views on the Washingtonian program produced,
in large part, its tenth Tradition: 'Alcoholics Anonymous has no
opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought never be drawn
into public controversy.'&quot;
There are now many reasons for A.A. to reconsider its 47-year-old position,
but the tenth Tradition is now solidly grounded, and &#8212; in any case &#8212;
A.A. is disinclined toward adaptation to changing conditions.<br>

The <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> states
that part of the grandiose delusion may be the feeling of having a
special relationship with a deity. Bill Wilson wrote,<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have come to believe He would like us to keep our
heads in the clouds with Him, but that our feet ought to be firmly

that is where our work must be done. These are the realities for
us.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<i>&quot;God wants us to have our heads in the clouds with Him.&quot;</i>
If that isn't a special relationship with a deity, then I don't know what is.
And God wants us to keep our feet firmly planted in the earth, because
He has a special mission for us &#8212; go convert the other alcoholics to our religion.
Not to make too bad of a pun of it, that is a heady mixture &#8212;
a real messianic complex.
<p>
And no, that is not <i>&quot;just an expression.&quot;</i>
You don't write a
whole book of <i>&quot;It's just an expression&quot;</i> and then claim that it
is <i>the</i> cure for alcoholism, and <i>the only way</i>
to avoid death by alcohol.

<a name="wiggle"> </a>
Bill Wilson stated repeatedly that the purpose of the <i>Big Book</i> was to
present a program that would save people from an alcoholic death.
It was a manual to be followed <i><b>exactly</b></i>.
Bill meant what he was writing to be taken literally,
and followed literally, step by step:

<p>
<a name="recovered"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this
book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a

So the followers have to be locked into an iron-clad contract that
is so explicit that every single detail is spelled out. None of it

<p>
Note, once again, Bill Wilson's actual contempt for his fellow
alcoholics. A.A. isn't a &quot;fellowship of equals&quot; or a self-help group, it's
a dictatorship where Bill Wilson gives the orders:
<ul>
<li> &quot;These drunks&quot; will try to cheat on &quot;this
deal&quot;, and they will &quot;wiggle out of&quot; Bill Wilson's
&quot;spiritual principles&quot; if they can get away with it.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The negative stereotyper</a> strikes again: 
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong" target="_blank">Alcoholics are

<li> By implication, <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_guru_right" target="_blank">Bill Wilson
is the wise elder statesman</a> who is qualified to discipline
the children. So what training or preparation qualified Mr. Wilson
to be an alcoholism recovery counselor, as well as the High Priest of
Alcoholics Anonymous?
<p>
<ul>
<li> Well, he drank a whole lot
of prohibition whiskey and bathtub gin for many years,
until his doctor, Dr. Silkworth, said Bill was showing signs of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#bathtub_gin" target="_blank">brain damage</a>.
<p>
<li> And then Dr. Silkworth said that Bill Wilson was
likely to go insane if Bill drank any more &#8212; that within a year, Bill
would develop a &quot;wet brain&quot; and have to be institutionalized.
So Bill drank some more.
<p>
<li> Then Bill had what he later described as
&quot;<a href="#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">a hot flash</a>&quot;
from belladonna and <i>delirium tremens</i> while detoxing in the hospital,
and &quot;saw God&quot;...
<p>
<li> And then he was coached and taught cult religion practices and beliefs
by some temporarily-sober religious nut-cases from
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group</a>.

Bill Wilson felt qualified to be both an alcoholism recovery counselor
and a priest, just based on his own drunken experiences and the religious
indoctrination he received at the hands of some Oxford Group cult members.

<p>
A new A.A. recruit who read Bill's grandiose declarations in the
<i>Big Book</i> believed them and excitedly wrote in his own story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p><br>
<a name="inspire_guidance"> </a>
The new A.A. members really are supposed to develop a special personal relationship with
a deity or Higher Power, and get their orders by communicating directly
with that Higher Power in Step Eleven. In return for the members <i>following
the dictates</i> of that Higher Power, the Higher Power will take away the
members' cravings for alcohol, solve all of their problems,
talk to them and give them more instructions and guidance and power,
and transport the members to a new and wonderful world.
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, pages 75, 42, 84 to 88, and 100,
respectively.)</font>
<p>

<a name="absurd_ideas"> </a>
But wait &#8212; it just gets better and better. Wilson describes how, in Step Eleven,
we learn to let God direct our thinking:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
On awakening, let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead.
We consider our plans for the day.
Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially
asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking
motives.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this
for a while.
What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration becomes a working
part of the mind.
Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact 
with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired 
at all times.
<font color="#9F0000">We might pay for this presumption in all sorts 
of absurd actions and ideas.</font>
Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will,
as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration.
<font color="#9F0000">We come to rely on it.</font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that
we be shown all through the day what our
next step is to be...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
pages 86 to 87.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, if we practice the Twelve Steps enough, we will supposedly end up in a
state of mind where we are in constant <i>conscious contact with
God</i> &#8212; a state where we are
<i><a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">channelling</a></i> God
in a non-stop s&eacute;ance
&#8212; and He is
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">guiding us</a>
and telling us what to do, all day long.
Bill Wilson admits that we may get into trouble by believing all kinds
of absurd ideas, and doing all kinds of crazy things, because we think
that the voice we hear in our head is God telling us to do something,
but, <font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Nevertheless&quot;</i></font>, Bill says,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;We come to rely on it.&quot;</i></font>

<p>
Do you think that sounds like what the psychiatrist was talking
about when he said,
<font color="blue">
&quot;The patient thinks he has a special relationship with a deity&quot;</font>?
<p>
The psychiatrist asks the patient,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Why did you do such a stupid thing?&quot;<br>
</font>

And the patient answers,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God told me to do it. I heard His voice
inside my head, talking to me and telling me to do it.&quot;<br>
</font>

And the psychiatrist just says,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Uh, yeh, right.&quot;
</font>

<p>
And notice also how slickly the rather paranoid Bill Wilson tried,
in advance, to deflect criticism there:
He admitted that some people did absurd things and had absurd ideas
when they thought they were following instructions from God,
but he implied that they were just beginners &#8212;<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious
contact with God&quot;</i>.<br>
</font>

The more experienced people will supposedly get beyond such problems.
So if someone is acting crazy, don't worry about it &#8212; that's just
a beginner, and he will get over it. He will eventually
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#closely_in_touch" target="_blank">learn to hear
<b><i>The Voice Of God</i></b> correctly</a>.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">

Just a little more</a> of William Wilson's special relationship to a deity,
from <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had
restored us to sanity and had enabled us
to live with some peace of mind in a sorely 
troubled world, then such a Higher Power
was worth knowing better, by as
direct contact as possible. The persistent use of
meditation and prayer, we found, did open the channel so
that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river
which led to sure power and safe guidance from God as we
were increasingly better able to understand Him.<br>
<a name="group_power"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question. Looking at those who were
only beginning and still doubting themselves, the rest of us were
able to see the change setting in.
From great numbers of such
experiences, we could predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.<br>

So, practicing these Steps,
Bill Wilson persistently practiced meditation and prayer until he could
<i>&quot;channel&quot;</i> God, and hear the voice of
God in his head, telling him what to do, all day long.

William Wilson claimed that he ended up getting both his marching orders
(&quot;safe guidance&quot;) and his &quot;sure power&quot;
directly from God,
while being increasingly better able to understand God,
and having
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question.</i>&quot;
</font>

<p>
Note the delusional distortions:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;those who were only beginning and still doubting themselves...&quot;</i>
</font>
Actually, the beginners were not doubting themselves as much as they were
doubting the sanity of the A.A. members, especially that Bill W., and
wondering whether those Twelve Steps would really work to make people
quit drinking, and wondering how a &quot;Higher Power&quot; who might
be a bedpan or a doorknob or a Group Of Drunks could really perform miracles, and wondering
whether all of that religious stuff was really necessary for quitting
drinking.

<p>
Admittedly, the newcomers still wondered
if they could really do that program. They were probably still
shaky from detoxing, and they still lacked the
bombastic self-assurance that comes from convincing yourself that you
are actually talking to God and getting <i>&quot;The
Keys to His Kingdom&quot;</i> &#8212; the kind of smug self-confidence that
Mark Twain so accurately described as
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;The calm confidence of a Christian holding four aces&quot;</i></font>.
<p>
The beginners haven't been indoctrinated and &quot;changed&quot;
enough to display that cultish behavior yet, but their major doubts
are still about the crazy behavior of the A.A. members around them,
and the goofy illogical dogma and the funny things they are supposed
to do to stop drinking.

<p>
And about the doubter
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;who still considered his well-loved A.A. group the
higher power...&quot;</i>
</font>
What if the doubter did no such thing?
Bill was making quite a grandiose assumption in stating that the
doubters considered their &quot;well-loved&quot; A.A. group to be their
&quot;Higher Power&quot;, something like their God.
What if they didn't really love Alcoholics Anonymous all that much?<br>
<p>
But no matter. Bill Wilson will fix that problem
by converting them all to his own religious beliefs:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;From great numbers of such experiences, we could predict
that the doubter ... would presently love God and call Him by
name.&quot;</b><br>
</font>
<p>
And A.A. still declares that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">it isn't a religion</a>... Outrageous.


<p>
And this line is rather disturbing:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubting
themselves, the rest of us were able to see the change setting in.&quot;<br>
</font>

Bill says that the beginners will not be able to see the
&quot;change setting in&quot;, but the elders will.
So the newcomers will not be aware of how the indoctrination
and the Twelve-Step program is changing them and affecting
their minds, bringing them to the point where they will be
ready to &quot;love God and call Him by name&quot;, but the
elders will know what is going on.
<p>
That sounds like brainwashing. The least that you can call it
is the underhanded disguised religious conversion of the newcomers
by the old-timers. (Yes, religious conversion done by this
organization that claims that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">it isn't a religion</a> and
it doesn't do religious conversions.)
<p>
<ul>
<li> One of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">Dr. Edgar H. Schein's essential conditions</a>
for a &quot;brainwashing&quot; or thought-control program is:
<font color="blue">
&quot;Keep the person unaware of what is going on and the changes
taking place.&quot;</font><br>
<li> One of Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer's conditions for an effective mind-control program is
<font color="blue">
&quot;Keep them unaware
that there is an agenda to change them, and unaware of how they are
being changed, step by step.&quot;
</font><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(She wrote that phrase,
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">step by step</a>&quot;</i>,
not me, and she wasn't referring to
Alcoholics Anonymous. She was referring to other brainwashing programs.)
</font><br>
<li> Bill Wilson just described how Alcoholics Anonymous is just such
a mind-control program.
</ul>
<p>
And Wilson restated that idea in the &quot;Spiritual Experience&quot;
appendix to the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p> 
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Quite often friends of the newcomer
are aware of the difference long before he is himself.
He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in
his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been
brought about by himself alone. What often takes place in a few
months could seldom have been accomplished by years of
self-discipline.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Appendix II, <i>Spiritual Experience</i>, page 569.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, the brainwashing program does work, and it works without the
beginners knowing what is being done to them.

One example of &quot;<b>Delusional (Paranoid) Disorder, Grandiose
Type</b>&quot;, is a man who
imagines that he is a great mathematician, but whose many pages
of &quot;brilliant equations&quot;
turn out to be nonsensical scrawlings and meaningless gibberish upon close examination.
Bill Wilson's magical, &quot;spiritual,&quot;
12-Step program for recovery from alcoholism is similar gibberish:
just pseudo-science, psycho-babble nonsense and bombastic religiosity
that does not and can not work.
The entire first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i> is just such
delusional ravings, like this description of what supposedly happens
when we confess all of our sins, &quot;defects of character&quot;,
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
and &quot;the exact nature of our wrongs&quot; to another person and God &#8212;

Our fears fall from us.

<i>&quot;We feel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with

</font>

If it were really that easy to get Heaven on Earth,
then everybody would be doing it.
<p>
Mr. Wilson offers us no explanation for how it is that Catholics, who
have been practicing confession of sins for two thousand years, have
never gotten those results from their practice of confession.
And, alas, the Catholics are no more immune to &quot;the drink problem&quot;
than the rest of us. The Catholic Church even has to maintain rehab facilities for fallen
priests who got hooked on drinking too much sacramental wine.

<p>
The only great experience that people really get from Step Five is immense
relief that such an embarrassing painful experience is finally over.
The tension had been building up all through Step Four, as the subject listed every
&quot;sin&quot;, &quot;defect of character&quot;, or &quot;moral shortcoming&quot; ever committed.
Then the subject had to confess it all to a relative stranger who wasn't even
an ordained priest, or sworn to secrecy.
And then, suddenly, it's over. The pressure is off. You can relax now.
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#sudden_release" target="_blank">
Some people misinterpret that sudden release of tension as a &quot;spiritual
experience&quot;</a>.

<p>
<a name="it_disappears">
It would be nice</a> if confession, or God, would make &quot;the drink problem&quot;
<i><b>just disappear</b></i>, but, sadly,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">it doesn't work that way</a>.
But Bill Wilson insisted that it does:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it. &nbsp; ...<br>
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now <b><i>that</i></b> is really a delusional cure for alcoholism.
Miraculously, without any thought or effort on our part,
God just makes the problem disappear. Poof!
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
No effort on our part? Don't we have to do the Twelve Steps?
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Note the implied pay-back: If we do Step Five and confess all of our
sins to God and our sponsor, that will please God so much that He will give us a
miracle in Step Seven in return, and remove our &quot;defects&quot;.)
</font>

<p>
It is extremely childish to imagine that there is a magical
quick fix for alcoholism. It's fun to read the story of Cinderella
and her Fairy Godmother, who waved her magic wand and made
everything suddenly wonderful.
And kids love the Harry Potter books now, too, with their wizardry and magic.
Harry waves his magic wand, and Hermione incants a magic spell, and suddenly
the problem is solved and everything is okay.
<a name="12X12q20"> </a>
But mature adults should be a little more realistic than that,
and should know that there is no easy panacea, no simple 12-Step
magical formula that will just suddenly fix all of their problems.
And to imagine that the fix will happen without any thought or
effort on our part... That's insane. That's Looney Tunes...
<p>
And no, that isn't a typo, and no, I'm not exaggerating. Bill Wilson
repeated that claim in his next book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So in a very complete and literal way, all A.A.'s have &quot;become
entirely ready&quot; to have God remove the mania for alcohol from
their lives. And God has proceeded to do exactly that.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
This does not mean we expect all our character defects to be lifted
out of us as the drive to drink was.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 65.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
(Can you believe that large numbers of drug and alcohol counselors are actually
pushing the A.A. 12-Step program as
a real medical treatment program for drug and alcohol problems?
It would be a hilarious joke if it weren't such a tragedy, with so many
people dying.)

<p>
Bill Wilson wrote and said several times that Doctor Robert Smith, the
co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, was one of those people who
<a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html#cravings" target="_blank">always suffered from
cravings for alcohol</a>.
God never removed the desire for drink from Dr. Bob.
Poor Dr. Bob was &quot;white-knuckling it&quot; every day for the rest of
his life, suffering a lot, and still, Bill Wilson cranked out
this happy fluff about how God just magically makes the drink
problem disappear, without any thought or effort on our part:
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It just comes! That is the miracle of it.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</center>
<p>
Obviously, Bill Wilson was not sharing his experiences with us;
he was writing down his deluded wishful thinking.
(Never mind the question of whether Bill Wilson was
<a href="orange-letters67.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">really sneaking drinks</a> like how
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#smoked_himself2death" target="_blank">he was sneaking cigarettes</a>.)

<p>
Note that if you say that Cinderella's Fairy Godmother is going
to magically solve all of your problems for you, then people
will immediately label you as insane.
But if you say that God is going to do it all for you, then
people will say that you are really religious.
They will give you the benefit of the doubt, and think that
you might not be insane.

<p>
The A.A. true believers also completely miss the point that
there is a major contradiction between having God cure our
alcoholism &#8212; having the drink problem just &quot;miraculously
removed&quot;, and not ever being able to drink again. 
The A.A. doctrine that controlled drinking is impossible for
a former alcoholic &#8212; indeed, that there is no such thing as
a &quot;former alcoholic&quot; &#8212; says that you haven't been
changed.
The slogan is <font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic.&quot;
</font>
And that slogan is certainly true of some people, including me.
We simply cannot drink alcohol any more, not even just one beer,
or we will become re-addicted immediately.
But if God and Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps had really fixed us,
then we should be done with alcoholism, and should be able to
drink in moderation, just like normal people.
The fact that us alcoholics cannot dare to ever drink alcohol
again only proves that God and A.A. have fixed nothing.
<p>
<a name="12X12q21"> </a>
<a name="God_quits"> </a>
Lest there be any doubt about God miraculously fixing us,
William Wilson emphatically said it again in his second book,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of course, the often disputed question of whether God can &#8212; and will,
under certain conditions &#8212; remove defects of character will be answered
with a prompt affirmative by almost any A.A. member.
To him, this proposition will be no theory at all; it will be just
about the largest fact in his life. He will usually offer his proof in a
statement like this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Sure, I was beaten, absolutely licked.
My own willpower just wouldn't work on alcohol. Change of scene, the
best efforts of family, friends, doctors, and clergymen got no place
with my alcoholism.
I simply couldn't stop drinking, and no human being could seem to do the
job for me.
But when I became willing to clean house and then asked a Higher Power, God
as I understood Him, to give me release, my obsession to drink vanished.
It was lifted right out of me...&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 63.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What self-pitying nonsense. He tried to quit drinking a few times, but failed because
when he craved a drink,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html#lizard_list" target="_blank">he rationalized that it was okay to drink</a>.
He told himself that he could have just a few drinks now and then, and keep it down
to a dull roar, and it would be okay.
But he was wrong. He returned to habitual binge drinking.
So then he declared defeat, and declared that it was impossible
for him to quit drinking. What a wimpy loser.
<p>
Notice the really bizarre complaint:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;I simply couldn't stop drinking,
and no human being could seem to do the job for me.&quot;</b><br>
</font>
Bill Wilson didn't seem to understand that when you quit drinking, smoking,
or drugging, you do it yourself.
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>No other human being <i>can</i> do the quitting for you.</b>
</font>
It isn't the job of &quot;family, friends, doctors, and clergymen&quot; to quit
drinking or quit smoking for you.
<p>
<a name="12X12q22"> </a>
It's really ridiculous to think that someone else could do the quitting for you.
It's insane.
But that's what Bill Wilson wanted: <b><i>&quot;an easier, softer way&quot;</i></b>
where <i>Somebody Else</i>, like God, did all of the hard work for him,
where somebody else did the quitting for him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
His lone courage and unaided will cannot do it.
Surely he must now depend upon Somebody or Something else.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 39.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Remember that we deal with alcohol &#8212; cunning, baffling, powerful!
Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all
power &#8212; that One is God. May you find Him now!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
pages 58-59.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And remember the ultimate <i>&quot;easier way&quot;</i> quote from above:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us

Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font> 
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>No thought or effort on our part?</i> It just doesn't get any easier
than that.
<p>
Wanting things easy is just what Bill Wilson accused other people of,
if they didn't want to do his Twelve Steps. The following lines from the
<i>Big Book</i> are read out loud at the start of almost every A.A. meeting:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you have decided you want what we have and are willing to go to
any length to get it &#8212; then you are ready to take certain steps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At some of these we balked. We thought we could find an easier,
softer way. But we could not.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is yet another example of Bill Wilson's habit of psychological
projection &#8212; he accused others of the crimes or sins of which he was
personally guilty. Bill wanted things to be easy, so he accused everyone
else of wanting things to be easy.
<p>

Then, Wilson claimed that God really had &quot;removed the mania for
alcohol from their lives.&quot;
Unfortunately, we end up with the same grim facts as before:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. doesn't
work, and is no more effective than <i>no treatment at all</i></a>.
All of the fair, unbiased, medical testing of A.A. that has
ever been done has shown those same sad results.

<p>
<a name="daily_vision"> </a>
Then, as if to cover for all of the failures, with both new and
old members relapsing and dying drunk, Mr. Wilson declared that God
only fixes us for <i>one single day at a time</i>, and that we have
to please God by doing slave labor for Him every single day,
and then beg God to remove our alcoholism,
<i>every single day</i>, for the rest of our lives.
This directly contradicts what Bill just wrote above, that <b><i>God
fixes us &quot;without any thought or effort on our part&quot;</i></b>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve
contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day
is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our
daily activities.
&quot;How can I best serve Thee &#8212; Thy will (not mine)
be done.&quot; These are thoughts which must go with us constantly.
We can exercise our will power along this line all we wish.
It is the proper use of the will.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
This is some of the most incredible lunacy that any faith-healer
or TV evangelist ever came up with:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;God will fix you, and will magically heal you,
but God's magic wears off after 24 hours, so you will have to beg
God to heal you again and again, day after day,
every single day for the rest of your life.&quot;</i><br>
</font>

That's right down there with garbage like,<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Just put your

And it is strange that Bill Wilson says that we can use our wills
(which we should not have, because we supposedly already gave them
to the care of &quot;God as we understood Him&quot; in Step Three),
to become sycophant slaves.
No other use of our will power is valid, but

Mr. Wilson continued:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<p>
Much has already been said about receiving strength, inspiration,
and direction from Him who has all knowledge and power.
If we have carefully followed directions, we have begun to sense the
flow of His Spirit into us. To some extent we have become God-conscious.
We have begun to develop this vital sixth sense.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
So now we are becoming psychic, &quot;God-conscious&quot;,
and can sense what God's will is with our new &quot;vital sixth sense&quot;.
We will actually be
<a href="orange-heresy.html#channelling" target="_blank"><b><i>channelling</i></b> God</a>,
sort of like a Shirley MacLaine on steroids,
but <i><b>only</b></i>
<i>&quot;if we have carefully followed directions&quot;</i>...
What directions?
Whose directions?
Well, Bill Wilson's directions, of course.
<p>
Note how carefully Mr. Wilson phrased that:
He didn't say,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you have carefully followed <i>MY</i>
directions, you will get to talk to God.&quot;<br>
</font>
No, that would have made Mr. Wilson's grandiose egotism far too obvious,
and would have invited questions like,<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;What makes this guy think <b><i>he</i></b> has all of the answers?
What makes <b><i>him</i></b> so special?&quot;<br>
</font>
So Bill Wilson just said that you must <b>&quot;carefully
follow directions&quot;</b>, which leaves it to your own mind
to fill in the details
like,<br>
&quot;Oh, yeh, <i>THE</i> directions of THE program.&quot;<br>
<a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html#hiding_behind" target="_blank">Wilson really was a
clever propagandist</a>.

Bill Wilson even bragged about his sanity:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoo

We are convinced that a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful
health restorative. We, who have recovered from serious drinking, are miracles
of mental health.<br>

<font face="Times" size="-1">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

This is good, too:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Even so has God restored us all to our right minds.&quot;</b><br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, &quot;We Agnostics&quot;, page 57.)<br>
</font>
<p>
Ordinary nutty people have to rely on their psychiatrist or new
medications
to restore them to sanity, but not William Wilson and his gang.
They all have God Almighty for their shrink.
And the way in which they &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">We Agnostics</a>&quot; &#8212;
were all restored to their 'right minds' was that God made them
believe in God.
<p>
And Alcoholics Anonymous members still say that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">this isn't a religion</a>?


<p>
In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill declared that what is wrong with doubters is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe
that our human intelligence was the last word, the alpha and the
omega, the beginning and end of all. Rather vain of us, wasn't it?<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, <i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i>, page 49.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since Bill <b><i>is</i></b> one of the true believers, he
<b><i>does</i></b>
regard himself as an <i>&quot;intelligent agent, a spearhead of
God's ever advancing Creation&quot;</i> (whatever that is),
and Bill doesn't believe in human intelligence, because
blind faith is much better than human intelligence.<br>
<br>
<font color="blue">
(Is it just me, or are you having trouble figuring out how you
can regard yourself as an intelligent agent for God
who doesn't believe in human intelligence?)
</font>
<p>

It's funny how almost every religious cult that comes along sees itself
as a &quot;movement&quot;, a big wave sweeping the world &#8212;
<i>&quot;spearheads of God's ever advancing Creation&quot;</i>
&#8212; winning the world for
God. What's funny is that God has had tens of thousands of years,
at least, if not billions of years,
to invade and conquer the planet Earth, and He still
hasn't gotten the job done yet...
Bill Wilson makes God into such a total loser
when it comes to imperialism and colonialism. Darth Vader
was <i>much</i> better at it. Heck, bacteria are better at it.
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>(But actually, that's a good thing. If God had really finished the job,
then all of those guys with messianic complexes wouldn't know what
to do with themselves. :-)</i>

</blockquote>

<p>
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bill Wilson insisted that good A.A. members must abandon
human intelligence and reason, and embrace blind faith, this way:
<P>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge
of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome.
We were grateful that Reason had brought
us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and
did not like to lose our support.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, <i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i>, Page 53.</font>
</blockquote>
<P>
That whole paragraph is an incredible piece of propaganda, a
real fairy tale.
It is also obviously as delusional as can be.
The object of the Alcoholics Anonymous program was supposed to
be to quit drinking, remember?
But now Bill Wilson insists that the goal of the A.A. program is to
abandon Reason and embrace blind faith in his teachings,
to reach &quot;the desired shore of faith&quot; in La-La-Land. 
<P>
Mr. Wilson claims that we have walked far over a
<i>&quot;Bridge of Reason&quot;</i> towards a <i>&quot;desired shore
of faith...&quot;</i> What? How do you do that?
What if we have done no such thing, and have no desire to reach
Bill Wilson's <b><i>New Land of Blind Faith</i></b>?

<P>
The flowery images like<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The outlines and the promise of the New Land had
brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
are ridiculous, completely delusional and grandiose.

<P>
But, finally, at the last minute, Reason stops us from wholeheartedly
embracing Bill Wilson's world of grandiose delusions. I should hope
that it does. It shows that the rest of us still have a few functioning
brain cells left, and still have at least some small amount of sanity
and contact with reality remaining.

<P>
Once again, note that Bill Wilson is trying to use reason and logic
to argue that we should abandon reason and logic.
We should consider the words of the American Revolutionary War hero
Ethan Allen, the leader
of the Green Mountain Boys in their capture of Fort Ticonderoga,
who had this to say on the subject:
<P>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those who invalidate reason ought seriously to consider
whether they argue against reason with or without reason; if with reason,
then they establish the principle that they are laboring to dethrone:
but if they argue without reason (which, in order to be consistent with
themselves they must do), they are out of reach of rational conviction,
nor do they deserve a rational argument.

<a name="idolatry"> </a>
Bill Wilson's alleged story of his own religious conversion at the hands of Ebby Thacher
is very revealing, too:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Despite the living example of my friend [a sober Ebby Thacher]
there remained in me the vestiges of my old prejudice. The
word God still aroused a certain antipathy. When the thought was
expressed that there might be a God personal to me this feeling
was intensified. I didn't like the idea. I could go for such conceptions
as Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind or Spirit of Nature but
I resisted the thought of a Czar of the Heavens, however loving
His sway might be. I have since talked with scores of men who felt
the same way.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said,
<i>&quot;Why don't you choose your own conception of God?&quot;</i><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That statement hit me hard. It melted
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#icy_intellectual" target="_blank">the icy intellectual mountain</a>
in whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years.
I stood in the sunlight at last.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>It was only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power
greater than myself. Nothing more was required of me to make my
beginning.</i> I saw that growth could start from that point.
Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what
I saw in my friend. Would I have it? Of course I would!<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus was I convinced that God is concerned with us humans
when we want Him enough. At long last I saw, I felt, I believed.
Scales of pride and prejudice fell from my eyes. A new world
came into view.<br>

<p>
Yes, Bill Wilson was genuinely insane, and he showed us that over and
over again
in the <i>Big Book</i> and his other writings like <i>Twelve Steps and
Twelve Traditions</i>.
Bill even became the leader of <a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">a religious
cult</a>.
He's literally a classic textbook case of
<b>297.10 Delusional (Paranoid) Disorder, Grandiose Type</b>.

<p>
(And it is funny that Bill Wilson couldn't stand the idea of a
<i>&quot;Czar of the Heavens&quot;</i>. I guess Bill was basically
like
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman</a>,
just anti-Russian and
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#praise_Hitler" target="_blank">anti-Communist</a>,
because soon, Bill was really happy with
<a href="orange-rroot870.html#Niebuhr_article" target="_blank">a Nazi God</a>
dictating orders to him.)


<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="Third_Step_Prayer"> </a>
As further evidence of Bill Wilson's insanity, consider this
quote &#8212; &quot;The Third Step Prayer&quot; &#8212; and its absurd stilted style:
<p>
<a name="prayer3">
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We were now at Step Three.</a> Many of us said to our
Maker, <i>as we understood Him</i>: &quot;God, I offer myself to
Thee &#8212; to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt.
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy
will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may
bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love,
and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!&quot; We thought
well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that
we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 63.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson really did think he was writing a new Bible. The
anachronistic &quot;Thou&quot;s, &quot;Thy&quot;s,
and &quot;Thee&quot;s are ridiculous. This book was written in
1938, not the year 938, and Bill wasn't
Amish or Quaker. The infantile masochistic grovelling before an
authoritarian God is just plain sick, and the
escapism is insane: God will take away all of your difficulties,
and solve all of your problems, and
you will be a happy little brown-nosing slave forevermore.
That is <a href="#Narcissistic" target="_blank">infantile narcissism</a>:
You regress to being a helpless baby, and
the Cosmic Big Daddy will take care of you and tell you what to do.

<i>Notice how Bill Wilson even tried to play mind games on God:</i>
Bill cleverly told God that it was to God's advantage to fix up the pitiful
alcoholic who was grovelling before him, because then God would have a
better-looking slave to show off &#8212; a slave whose appearance would impress other
people and make God look like a really grand, benevolent slave-master:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>

and Thy Way of life.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
But the only way that Bill Wilson wanted to 'help' other people was to make
them into just some more grovelling slaves of God.
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>


<p>
<a name="no_ego"> </a>
And Bill really doesn't know what he is talking about when
he begs God to be relieved
from <i>&quot;the bondage of self&quot;</i>. Bill doesn't understand
that you do not loose your ego, your selfhood,
just by wishing that it would go away, or by begging God to make it go
away, or by saying that you are surrendering to God. It isn't that easy.
If it were, everybody would be doing it.

<p>
Remember the old Zen problem: A student who has been working for ten years to free
himself from all desires goes to his Zen master and asks,
<font color="blue">
&quot;But Master, how do I get rid of my last desire,
the desire to be free of all desires?&quot;<br>
</font>
<br>
The old Zen master smiles and answers,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Now you really do have a problem, don't you?&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
Similarly, if the student asks the master,
<font color="blue">
&quot;How do I get released from the ego, and the bondage of self?&quot;<br>
</font>
<br>
The old Zen master will smile and ask,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Little grasshopper, <i>WHO</i> wishes to be
released from 'the bondage of self'?&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
It's like a genuine Chinese finger trap; the harder you try to pull your
fingers out, the more tightly the trap holds them.
The more you try to get rid of your &quot;self&quot;, the more you reassert
your own will and your &quot;self&quot; &#8212; especially your wish to be rid of self.
If such a misguided spiritual student
is not careful, he can end up totally preoccupied with himself &#8212; constantly talking
about &quot;my desires&quot; and &quot;my enlightenment&quot; and &quot;my ego&quot; &#8212; while trying
to get rid of &quot;self&quot;.

<p>
And what does Bill have in mind for himself, once he
has been released from &quot;The Bondage of
Self&quot;? Death? The death of ego?<br>
Bill refused that &#8212; that was exactly the thing that he
fought to avoid at the start of his 'spiritual experience'.
(<a href="#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">See below</a>.)
<p>
But in the Christian mystic, Buddhist, Hindu,
and Sufi religions, release from self
is a kind of voluntary death that ends up making you into
something greater: you voluntarily die and expand into or
dissolve into and merge with the universe, or with God, or both.

<p>
The Sufis say, &quot;Die before you die, and live forever.&quot;
<p>
Make no mistake about it: <b>You die.</b>
<ul>
<li> It's scary as can be &#8212;
you are afraid that you will stop breathing &#8212; you give up and you let go
and you die.<br>
<li> You put all of your big chips on the table &#8212; your life, your mind,
and your soul &#8212; and you roll the dice. You take the big chance, the
ultimate dare. You let go and you die.<br>
<li>
You don't just have an intense sentimental experience like
<a href="orange-not_good.html#choked_up" target="_blank">getting all choked up</a>
while singing &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; in church &#8212; you die.
<li> You don't just sort of die &#8212; you die.
<li> You don't just have a funny experience, or an intense religious
experience &#8212; you die and go to pieces.
</ul>

<p>
But Bill refused that; he wanted to be freed from selfhood, he said, but
<a href="#wanttolive" target="_blank">he didn't want his ego to die</a>. When Bill Wilson
felt ego loss coming on, he fought against it:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;He wanted to live. He would do anything, anything,
to be allowed to go on living.&quot;</i></b>
</font>

<p>
Bill talks the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk.<br>
He can't; he doesn't even know what the words really mean.


<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="arrogant">
Consider Bill's messianic complex.</a> Immediately after he
flipped out and &quot;saw God&quot; while
getting Dr. Silkworth's <a href="#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna</a>
cure, he began collecting
alcoholics, starting home churches,
and trying to convert people to his way of seeing things. The
funny thing is, he does not seem to
have ever considered just handing the other alcoholics over to
Dr. Silkworth so that they could
also get Charles Towns' belladonna cure and see God too. Bill Wilson only
considered converting everybody
to his own viewpoint. When you think about it, that is extremely
arrogant: Don't trust other
people to see things for themselves; they might screw it up; just
get them to see things your way.

<p>
That is more than just arrogant, it is a fair description of megalomania,
or delusions of grandeur.

<p>
In fact, Bill Wilson wrote the Twelve Steps so that members would
<i>exactly</i> follow his prescribed course of action, and do
<i>exactly</i> what he said. He had no intentions of cutting
anyone any slack, or giving them any flexibility in their program
of recovery, or of letting them see anything for themselves.
Bill wanted them to all follow his orders, and do <b>everything</b>
exactly his way.
(Remember the quote above, where Bill Wilson wanted 12 steps so explicit
that there was <a href="#wiggle" target="_blank">&quot;no room for drunks to wiggle out of it.&quot;</a>)
<p>
It was only the stubbornness of the other early A.A. members,
after a long and loud screaming contest, that forced Bill to write
a preface to the Twelve Steps
that said that the Steps are only &quot;suggested as a
course of recovery.&quot;
(See page 59 of the <i>Big Book</i>.)

Bill Wilson wanted the Twelve Steps to be a requirement for membership.
But Bill soon got his revenge: On the very first page of
the next chapter that he wrote, chapter 6, Bill declared
that you were in danger of relapse if you didn't do all of his
Twelve Steps:<br>
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>
&quot;If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.&quot;
</i></b><br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 72, the first page of chapter 6.)</font>
</center>

<p>
<a name="12X12q23"> </a>
And, later, in <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
Mr. Wilson proclaimed that doing his Twelve Steps was really a matter of
life or death, not a choice at all:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested
<font color="#9F0000">[MY required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to <font color="#9F0000">[MY]</font> spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[cult practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is some cute double-talk: follow our &quot;suggestions,&quot; or die.
Why, it's just like <i>&quot;<b>The Godfather</b>&quot;</i> making
you an offer you can't refuse:
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Don Corleone:</b>
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Hey, Paisano, whatsa this I hear? People are tellin' me
that youza not goin' to the meetins no more...
People are sayin' that youza not doin' the Twelve Stepsa no more...
What kinda example youza settin' for our poor little babies?
Youza wouldn't wanna confuza duh newcomers, now would ya'?
I <font color="#9F0000">suggest</font> that youza better get back into
those rooms and start doin' those Twelve Stepsa real hard now, before
something really bad happens to you ass...&quot;</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="ftnt08_ret"> </a>
And note that Bill wrote &quot;our&quot; suggested steps, not
<i>&quot;MY&quot;</i> suggested steps, as if other A.A. members had helped to
create them &#8212;
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">they didn't</a>
&#8212; or as if the A.A. membership was
unanimous in declaring that you had to do Bill's Twelve Steps, or
else. They weren't. Many of &quot;<a href="#org100" target="_blank">The First
100</a>&quot; (who really numbered 40),<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt08">8</a></sup></font>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod" target="_blank">about half of them</a>, in
fact, thought that Bill's Twelve Steps were just a bunch of stupid
bombastic religious fanaticism that would drive away the very
alcoholics whom the program was supposed to help.
They were the members who demanded that the Steps be called
&quot;suggestions&quot;, and not &quot;requirements.&quot;
They said that people should just go straight for total sobriety,
and not waste any time on Bill Wilson's stupid Steps.
<p>
The level of detail in Bill Wilson's Big Lie that is revealed
by that <i>&quot;our&quot;</i> versus <i>&quot;my&quot;</i> word choice,
is quite remarkable: Like a skilled craftsman, Wilson actually carefully
chose every word that he wrote while constructing his Big Lie,
<a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html#hiding_behind" target="_blank">to create just the right
false impression</a>, to slip some carefully-chosen idea into people's
unsuspecting minds...
<p>
And Wilson did that in sentence after sentence, chapter after chapter,
book after book.
That is no small feat. If there is some kind of award, sort of like
the Oscars, for the creation of masterpieces of propaganda, then
Bill Wilson at least deserves a nomination for his books
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.

<p>
And again, Mr. Wilson showed his delusions of grandeur there:
in Bill's demented mind, if you wouldn't do his Twelve Steps,
then you were guilty of, and would
die from, &quot;personal disobedience to spiritual principles.&quot;
Bill implied that only he knew and had written down
<i>The Real Spiritual Rules of God</i>, and that they are embodied
in Bill's Twelve Steps:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;No other church is valid or useful here &#8212; their spiritual principles
are worthless,
and practicing them will not save you from a fate worse than death.
Either follow <i><b>Bill's</b></i> 'suggested' rules to the best of your ability,
or you are disobeying <b><i>The Real Spiritual Principles of God</i></b>,
and you will pay for your stupid disobedience with your life.
You are signing your own death warrant if you don't do what
Bill Wilson says.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="two_stepper"> </a>
Bill Wilson also declared that you won't be able to handle the trials and
tribulations of real life if you don't do his Twelve Steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are sober and happy in our A.A. work. Things go well at home and
office. We naturally congratulate ourselves on what later proves to be a far
too easy and superficial point of view. We temporarily cease to grow
because we feel satisfied that there is no need for all of A.A.'s Twelve
Steps for us. We are doing fine with just a few of them. Maybe we are
doing fine with only two of them, the First Step and that part of the
Twelfth where we &quot;carry the message.&quot; In A.A. slang, that blissful
state is known as &quot;two-stepping.&quot; And it can go on for years.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The best-intentioned of us can fall for the &quot;two-step&quot; illusion.
Sooner or later the pink cloud stage wears off and things go disappointingly
dull. We begin to think that A.A. doesn't pay off after all. We become
puzzled and discouraged.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then perhaps life, as it has a way of doing, suddenly hands us a great big
lump that we can't begin to swallow, let alone digest. We fail to get a
worked-for promotion. We lose that good job. Maybe there are serious
domestic or romantic difficulties, or perhaps that boy we thought God
was looking after becomes a military casualty.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What then? Have we alcoholics in A.A. got, or can we get, the resources to
meet these calamities which come to so many?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; ... &nbsp; &nbsp;
Well, we surely have a chance if we switch from &quot;two-stepping&quot;
to &quot;twelve-stepping,&quot; if we are willing to receive that grace
of God which can sustain and strengthen us in any catastrophe.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Bill says that you can happily, blissfully, two-step for years.
Well then, who needs the Twelve Steps?
They are obviously <i>not</i> needed for quitting drinking,
and staying blissfully quit for many years. Bill Wilson says so.
<p>
Notice how Bill Wilson is again using the preacher's trick of using the
word &quot;we&quot; when he means <b>&quot;you&quot;</b>, the way a
preacher will say
&quot;we are guilty&quot; when he means &quot;YOU are guilty&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
We are sober and happy...<br>
We naturally congratulate ourselves on what later proves to be a far
too easy and superficial point of view.<br>
We temporarily cease to grow because we feel satisfied...
</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="spiritual_growth"> </a>
Notice how Bill Wilson equates the following of his dictates with
&quot;spiritual growth&quot;:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;We temporarily cease to grow because we feel satisfied
that there is no need for all of A.A.'s
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill's]</font>
Twelve Steps for us.&quot;</b><br>
</font>
[That's the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#equality" target="_blank"><i>False Equality</i></a>.]<br>
Bill Wilson actually had the arrogance
to declare that people would not &quot;grow spiritually&quot; unless
they practiced Bill's twelve steps. (And yes, Bill is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hide" target="_blank">hiding behind other people</a>
again, by saying &quot;A.A.'s Twelve Steps&quot; rather than
&quot;<i>my</i> twelve steps&quot;.)
<p>
How did Bill Wilson become such an expert on spiritual matters?
<ul>
<li>
Which <a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">seminary</a> did he graduate from?
<font color="blue">None</font>.
<li> What religion trained him and ordained him as a priest or minister?
<font color="blue">None did</font>.
<li> Who were Bill's gurus?
<font color="blue">Jim Beam and Jack Daniels</font>.
<li> What were Bill's sources of religious knowledge?
<font color="blue">
<ul>
<li> some high school years at The Burr &amp; Burton Seminary,
a private school in Manchester, Vermont
(<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">where he failed to graduate</a>),
<li> followed by many years of cheap whisky and bathtub gin,
<li> then <a href="#belladonna" target="_blank">a drug-induced vision of God</a>,
<li> followed by indoctrination in the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">goofy cult religion</a>
beliefs of some Oxford Group members.
</ul>
</font>
</ul>
And then Wilson declared that people wouldn't grow spiritually unless
they followed his dictates. That's delusions of grandeur.

And Bill warns us that eventually, we won't feel so good:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
Sooner or later the pink cloud stage wears off and things go
disappointingly dull. We begin to think that A.A. doesn't pay off
after all. We become puzzled and discouraged.
</font>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, if any people were ever unhappy, at any time in the next
dozen years, it supposedly proved that they had fallen for the
&quot;two-step illusion.&quot;
People will become &quot;puzzled and discouraged&quot;,
Bill said,
if they don't grovel before their sponsor, confessing all of their sins
and shortcomings, as well as doing all of the other Twelve Steps.
<p>
Do you know what very important thing Bill Wilson totally failed
to mention there?
<p>
<b>Cigarette smoking.</b>
<p>
After the initial rush of health that comes from quitting drinking,
many people
become more aware of the harm that smoking is doing to their bodies.
They start to feel very depressed when they realize that they are still
sick and addicted, and might die from it.
But Bill wouldn't talk about that, because he was a totally addicted
cigarette smoker who never quit.
(Remember, we started this web page with the
&quot;spiritual&quot; story of how Bill or one of his buddies wouldn't quit smoking.)
<a href="#smoked_himself2death" target="_blank">Bill smoked himself to death</a>,
and died of emphysema and pneumonia, while
telling people that smoking was okay.
Bill didn't tell people to quit smoking if they felt depressed and
discouraged, and wanted to feel better. He just told them to practice
the Twelve Steps more. Bill was insane.
<p>

<p>
Continuing with that quote, Bill said that something bad will eventually
happen in your life. I agree.
It's Murphy's Law. Something bad will always happen, eventually, sooner
or later. Bill said that you won't be able to handle it unless you
do Bill's Twelve Steps. I disagree. There is absolutely no evidence that
the Twelve Steps make you better able to handle those nasty blows
and hard knocks that life can deliver, and Bill offered us no evidence
of that, either.
<p>

Then, in another verbal shell game, more slick double-talk, Bill
arbitrarily declared that we <i>surely have a chance</i> if we
switch to doing all twelve of his steps, and if we <i>also</i>
receive the grace of God.
Yes, and I surely have a chance of winning the lottery, if I buy a ticket.
But how much of a chance?
There is not necessarily <i>any</i> connection between doing
Bill's Twelve Steps, and receiving grace from God,
but Bill deceptively linked them together in one sentence, as if he
had a special exclusive wholesale distribution arrangement with God &#8212;
as if God would give you His grace only if you were willing to
do all twelve of Bill Wilson's Steps.
What incredible arrogance.
That's Bill's insane delusions of grandeur, again.
That's <i><font color="blue">&quot;The patient thinks he has a special
relationship with a deity&quot;</font></i>, again.

<p>
And if you read those lines carefully, you will see that Bill was
actually saying that the strength comes from receiving the
grace of God &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;that grace of God which can sustain and
strengthen us in any catastrophe&quot;
</font>
&#8212; <i>not from doing Bill's Twelve Steps</i>, but Bill still wanted
us to do all twelve of his Steps anyway.

<p>
Current sponsors do it Bill's way, which becomes
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="_blank">yet another bait and switch stunt</a>:<br>
First, when you are a newcomer, they will tell you,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>The Twelve Steps are only a suggested program of
recovery. This is just a nice, loose, self-help group.</b>&quot;<br>
</font>
But soon, the story will be,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>You will relapse and die drunk if you don't do all of the
Twelve Steps, and do them correctly. Somebody who won't do the Twelve
Steps is signing his own death warrant. And if you don't die,
you will turn into a <a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunk.</b>&quot;
</font>

<p>
<a name="not_dry"> </a>
Apparently, Doctor Bob also saw people abstain without A.A.'s help
for plenty of years. The <i>Big Book</i> says of one man who didn't join A.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He stayed &quot;dry&quot; for thirteen years! Dr. Bob often
said that it was a record for what he felt was a typical alcoholic.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, Chapter B8, <i>&quot;From Farm to City&quot;</i>,
by Ethel M., page 263.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how the word &quot;dry&quot; is in quotes. This
man who abstained from both alcohol and Alcoholics Anonymous for thirteen years didn't quite
qualify as <i>really dry</i>, in the authoress' opinion.
Apparently, he was only just &quot;sort of dry&quot;,
without doing all of those meetings and those Twelve Steps.
<p>
Actually, this is just some more standard A.A. cult dogma: &quot;You are
not <i><b>&quot;in recovery&quot;</b></i> or <i><b>&quot;sober&quot;</b></i> unless
you are doing A.A. and The Twelve Steps;
you are <i><b>&quot;only abstaining&quot;</b></i> or <i><b>&quot;only dry&quot;</b></i>.
But this cultish true-believer authoress, Ethel M., didn't feel that this thirteen-year
winner even deserved the word &quot;dry&quot;, so she put it in quotes.
<p>
This begs the question: <font color="blue">&quot;If this guy's relapse after
thirteen years of sobriety is used as yet another example to
prove that you can't do it without A.A. and The Twelve Steps,
then why don't all of those A.A. members' relapses after
just a few months or years prove that you can't do it <i>with</i> A.A.?</font>
<p>
According to Bill Wilson, if you are sober for 6 months by doing
the Twelve Steps, then that
proves that the Twelve Steps work. But if you are sober for only 13 years
without A.A. and the Twelve Steps, then that proves that you can't do it
without A.A....
<p>
And this brings up yet another problem with Bill's logic: he constantly
contradicts himself. He will, for instance, sound very humble and
reasonable one minute, and then make arrogant absolute and dictatorial
statements the next. For example:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our book is meant to be suggestive only.
We realize we know only a little.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have no desire to convince anyone that there is only one way
by which faith can be acquired. &nbsp; ...<br>
Those having religious affiliations will find nothing here disturbing
to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over
such matters.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
Chapter 2, <i>There Is A Solution</i>, page 28.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Note that Alcoholics Anonymous is an <i>&quot;acquire faith&quot;</i>
program...)
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

but as far as we are concerned, it has worked with us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 144.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

But then
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_ONLY_way" target="_blank">Bill pulled
a bait-and-switch stunt</a>, and
changed the story to the exact opposite &#8212; He said
that you are signing your own death warrant
if you don't follow his <i>&quot;suggested&quot;</i> Twelve Steps precisely:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#9F0000">[Bill's required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
Or Bill will tell you that God will take away the drink problem
<i>without any thought or effort on your part</i>,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it.
&nbsp; ...<br>
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

And then Bill will tell you that
you must be a slave of God, and do His bidding <i>every day</i>, or else
God won't take away the drink problem, and you will die a horrible
death.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve
contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Just where did that &quot;vision&quot; come from? Prayer, meditation,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna_recipe" target="_blank">belladonna</a>,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#rational_mind" target="_blank">delirium tremens</a>,

&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#no_musts" target="_blank">There are no <i>musts</i>
in Alcoholics Anonymous, just suggestions</a>&quot;?</font>)
<p>

And then, in the next sentence, Bill wrote that the only proper use of
our free will is to choose to become slaves of God:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;How can I best serve Thee &#8212; Thy will (not mine)
be done.&quot; These are thoughts which <font color="#9F0000">must</font> go with us constantly.
We can exercise our will power along this line all we wish.
It is the proper use of the will.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------
<font color="#9F0000">
(And remember that Bill also said that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">you are not
mentally qualified to decide for yourself
what God really wishes you to do</a>. Your sponsor and the other elders will decide that for
you, and tell you what to think and what to do.)
</font>
------------------------------------------------------------------->


<p>
Or Bill will exhort all of the A.A. members to abandon self-seeking,
and work selflessly and without any thought of personal profit,
while <a href="orange-bigbook.html#grabby" target="_blank">he takes all of the money
for himself</a>...

<p>
<a name="ftnt18_ret"> </a>
<a name="Bill_W_Movement"> </a>
And Bill Wilson only faked humility.
While he exhorted everyone else to give
up ego, and to stop being self-seeking, he actually wanted the
Alcoholics Anonymous organization to
have the name &quot;The Bill W.
Movement.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt18">18</a></sup></font>
But the other alcoholics just wouldn't have it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At one point Bill considered &quot;The Bill W. Movement&quot; &#8212; the
ego had not been totally deflated &#8212; but he was quickly talked out of
that.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.</i>, Robert Thomsen, page 285.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The author here, Robert Thomsen, has a way with a phrase
himself. To say that Bill's
ego had not been totally deflated is so cute that it is funny.

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="narcissistic2"> </a>
<p>
Dr. Alexander Lowen wrote <a href="#Lowen" target="_blank">a great book</a> on the
Narcissistic Personality Disorder where he declared that
narcissism is not falling in love with one's self, but rather with a
false image of one's self. That small subtle difference actually makes
a very large difference. In the original Greek mythology, Narcissus died
&#8212; starved to death &#8212; because he was obsessed with his own image and
stared at it endlessly.
But as Narcissus approached death, his real emaciated appearance could not have
been very attractive. He must have actually looked terrible, but Narcissus
just didn't see it.
Narcissus was seeing an illusion, not his true appearance.
<p>
Dr. Lowen advances the idea that narcissism is often caused
by child abuse and prolonged humiliation and pain in childhood. The child
adopts a persona where he feels no pain and is powerful and invulnerable.
The child thinks, <i>&quot;When I grow up, I'll be so powerful and strong that no
one can hurt me or humiliate me ever again.&quot;</i> Then the child, who grows into
adulthood, spends the rest of his life pursuing and defending an illusion.
Narcissists are obsessed with defending and preserving their image &#8212; they can't
stand it if somebody &quot;makes them look bad&quot; &#8212; they can't stand criticism.
They deny their true feelings and put on a mask of unfeeling, because
they imagine that it will keep them from being hurt again.
Likewise, they completely disregard other people's feelings.
They are obsessed with power and control, so that they can
control the world around them and prevent anyone from humiliating
them again.
Narcissists are often extremely seductive and manipulative people, often charismatic
charmers, and occasionally high achievers as well.
They lie habitually, without giving it a second thought.
They fear insanity.
<p>
In other words, Dr. Lowen was describing Bill Wilson, the
abused son of an alcoholic father and a neurotic mother.

Bill's parents obviously really messed up his mind.
Something that the A.A. literature
doesn't like to mention very often is the fact that Bill Wilson was the abused
son of an alcoholic father, and that alcohol destroyed his family when
he was young, which made him an <i>untreated</i> Adult Child Of
an Alcoholic (ACOA).
Bill's father abandoned the family when Bill was still just a boy,
and then Bill felt that his mother Emily had abandoned him too, by
dumping Bill and his sister on her parents and going off to Boston
to study osteopathy. Bill went into a year-long bout of depression.

<p>
<a name="ftnt25_ret"> </a>
Even in childhood, Bill displayed signs of narcissism &#8212; 
he had to be the first and the best at everything &#8212; the president
of his senior class in high school,
the best baseball player and the captain of the baseball team,
and &quot;The Number One Man &#8212; the very first American to ever make a working
boomerang&quot; and the young electronics wiz who allegedly kept
his whole village agog with his amateur radio feats.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
All of those &quot;accomplishments&quot; were meant to compensate for Bill's feelings of
inadequacy and inferiority,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt25">25</a></sup></font>
and whenever Bill couldn't get the best of everything,

(Notice how the narcissistic, insecure Bill Wilson even bragged about
his childhood activities

Bill lived with his grandparents after his parents divorced

Then, of course, Bill later turned into a raging alcoholic, and displayed
all of the signs of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic personality disorder</a> and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">delusions of grandeur</a>.
And then Bill suffered from severe, prolonged, bouts of deep crippling
chronic depression for most of his life. (His last period of depression
lasted for 11 years, from 1944 to 1955.)
It is difficult to say exactly who did what to Bill, but together,
they induced in Bill an insanity from which he never recovered.

Bill Wilson was obviously obsessed with control. He ended up in the awkward situation
of having to share control of Alcoholics Anonymous with a Board of Trustees.
Giving control of A.A. to a Board of Trustees helped Bill's public image and helped
to make him appear to be noble and unselfish and generous &#8212; like he wasn't really trying to
be &quot;the Grand Poohbah of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.
But then the Board of Trustees would not just rubber-stamp Bill's decisions &#8212; they
voted their consciences and did what they believed was best &#8212;
so Bill Wilson ended up fighting with the
Trustees whenever he couldn't have his own way about everything.
<p>
Nan Robertson wrote that Bill Wilson would vacation in Vermont, and then,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Bill returned home from these trips refreshed, ready to do battle again
with the trustees.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Nan Robertson, page 57.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The earliest A.A. members had selected a group of the wisest and most honorable men
that they could find to be the first trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous, and all that Bill Wilson
could do was &quot;battle with them&quot; again and again to get his own way.
<p>
When Bill Wilson discovered that the Board of Trustees would not kowtow to him
and rubber-stamp his dictates, he came up with a new strategy:
replace the non-alcoholic Board members with sycophant A.A. members who
worshipped Bill. Robert Thomsen the A.A. true believer
tried to explain Bill's behavior with this slanted story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He had, however, one pet and perennial concern and that was the ratio of
alcoholic to nonalcoholic members of the board. It was of paramount importance to
him that the majority of trustees, if only a majority of one, be alcoholics.
It became his cause, his own private war, and he was willing to risk anything,
any relationships, to win a battle or even a small skirmish in this war.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He admired the nonalcoholic members. They were some of the finest men in America,
some of his closest friends, and all of them had devoted themselves to AA without stint.
But on this one subject Bill W. was adamant. He was stubborn, bullheaded,
any term they wanted to apply to him &#8212; and indeed through the years they
used far harsher ones (he even applied them to himself) &#8212;
but he could not yield. The thought of nondrunks having a final say in any
decision stuck in his craw; it became his King Charles's head.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the more wounding skirmishes was with Dr. [Leonard] Strong, Dorothy's
husband [Bill's sister's husband, i.e., his brother-in-law].
Leonard had been in on the very inception of AA, one of the foundation's first
board members; before that he had been Bill's doctor, his confidant, the one who
had put him in the hospital, paid the bills and stood by him always.
No man could have done more. But Leonard Strong was a physician, the son of a physician,
and deep in his being was the medical man's belief that in the final analysis
decisions had to be made by detached, uninvolved persons. It was over this
very matter that Leonard felt, in 1954, that he must resign from the board.
Happily, nothing could permanently affect the bond that existed between Bill
and the Strongs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Year after year, the subject of ratios would be brought up. Bill would argue
tenaciously, but each time he'd be voted down. His reactions to these defeats
was often severe &#8212;
<font color="#9F0000">
he couldn't help reading personal rejection into this difference
of opinion &#8212; and he would be thrown into spells of depression</font>
that were difficult for those who knew him best to understand.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Also at these times he began to recognize many symptoms of his old dry benders.<br>

Actually, there is no such thing as a &quot;dry bender&quot;. That was a term
that Bill Wilson liked to use to mask his irrational behavior and screaming temper tantrums and mental illness.
<p>
And again, we see how Bill Wilson was <b>&quot;thrown into spells of depression&quot;</b>
whenever he didn't get his own way.
That is a narcissistic little boy, not a wise man with a cure for addictions.
<a href="#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Like the DSM-IV said</a>,

After the Board of Trustees voted contrary to Bill's wishes another time,
Bill wrote a sarcastic self-pitying letter to the trustees, saying that
he hoped that the trustees would still see fit to
allow him to have an office in the A.A. headquarters.

Bill Wilson wrote that Al-Anon Family Group members spoke at the
Alcoholics Anonymous 20th Anniversary convention,
parroting Bill's teachings like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Family Group speakers asked and answered plenty of questions like these:
&quot;Weren't we just as powerless over alcohol as the alcoholics themselves?
Sure we were.&quot;
&quot;And when we found that out, weren't we often filled with just as much bitterness
and self-pity as the alcoholic ever had been? Yes, that was sometimes a fact.&quot;
&quot;After the first tremendous relief and happiness which resulted when A.A. came
along, hadn't we often slipped back into secret and deep hurt that A.A. had
done the job and we hadn't? For many of us, it was certainly so.&quot;
&quot;Not realizing that alcoholism is an illness, hadn't we taken sides with
the kids against the drinking member? Yes, we had often done that, to their
damage. No wonder then, that when sobriety came, the emotional benders in our
homes often went right on and sometimes got worse.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 33.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The simple answer to all of those questions is, &quot;No.&quot;
<p>
<a name="ftnt19_ret"> </a>
<ul>
<li> We are not powerless over alcohol.
<p><li> Wives of alcoholics are not necessarily filled with self-pity and bitterness.
<p><li> The wives are not
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#old_meetings" target="_blank">jealous of A.A. and God</a>
for healing their husbands.

<p>
<a name="emotional_bender"> </a>
<li> The wives are not responsible for their husbands throwing screaming temper
tantrums &#8212; which Bill Wilson euphemistically called &quot;emotional benders&quot;.
<p>
The reason that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;when sobriety came, the emotional benders in our homes often went
right on and sometimes got worse&quot;</i>
</font>
is because Bill Wilson was mentally ill &#8212; a screaming raving lunatic &#8212;
and quitting drinking alcohol didn't fix that.<br>
<font color="#00009F">
Excessive alcohol consumption was just one of the many ways in which Bill Wilson tried
to cope with his insanity. He also tried cult religion, psychoanalysis,
LSD, chain-smoking cigarettes, obsessive philandering,
occult spiritism and necromancy, and being a cult leader.<br>
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue"><i>
By the way, there is no such thing as an &quot;emotional bender&quot;.
That was just one of Bill Wilson's euphemisms that he used to minimize
and explain away the screaming temper tantrums that he threw to get his
own way.
<p>
Another euphemism that Bill used to explain his behavior was to declare
that he had a &quot;power-driving personality&quot;.
</i></font>
</blockquote>

<p><li> If the wives sided with the kids against a drunk husband, then they
probably had a good reason for doing so, and it probably didn't &quot;damage&quot;
the drunk husbands any.
<font color="blue"><i>(Such self-pitying nonsense; pure narcissism.)</i></font><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Whether the drunk husband had an &quot;illness&quot; was irrelevant &#8212;
What was she supposed to do, side with him and help him beat the children?<br></i>
</font>
</ul>
<p>
The narcissistic Bill Wilson just hated his wife Lois criticizing him
for drinking too much and misbehaving. She angrily called him
&quot;<a href="#drunken_sot" target="_blank">a drunken sot</a>&quot; when he threw a
drunken screaming temper tantrum &#8212; tearing up the house and kicking out
door panels and throwing a sewing machine at
her<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt19">19</a></sup></font> &#8212;
and Bill doesn't seem to have ever forgiven her for it.
<p>
Even twenty years later,
<a href="#jealous" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was still taking angry swipes at Lois</a>,
attacking her, putting her down, criticizing her, getting back at her for it,
 just like how he called Lois
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good" target="_blank">selfish, silly, and dishonest</a>
in the <i>Big Book</i>.
That means that Bill Wilson nursed a bitter self-pitying resentment
against his wife for at least twenty years, while
<a href="#projection" target="_blank">he hypocritically accused <i>all other</i> alcoholics and their
wives</a> of &quot;having resentments&quot;:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

When narcissists are confronted by people who disparage the legitimacy of
their extravagant claims, they tend to react badly. They may plunge into
depression &#8212; or become infuriated. As Gardner explained to the court,
when narcissists are belittled or denigrated &quot;they feel horrible....
They have this sense they're either grandiose, perfect, and beautiful
people, or absolutely worthless. So if you challenge their grandiosity &#8212;
these are the words in the diagnostic manual &#8212; 'They respond with

<blockquote>

Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with Narcissistic Personality
Disorder very sensitive to &quot;injury&quot; from criticism or defeat.
Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt these
individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow and

Such experiences often lead to social withdrawal or an appearance of
humility that may mask and protect the grandiosity.<br>

Thus, shortly after the Wilsons moved into their Bedford Hills home,
they began to hold regular &quot;spook sessions,&quot; complete with
mysterious messages on a Ouija board, and on at least one occasion they held a

him.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt21">21</a></sup></font>

<p>
<a name="auto_writing"> </a>
And
<a href="#Henrietta" target="_blank">Henrietta Seiberling wrote</a> that Bill
Wilson also practiced automatic writing, another favorite trick,
like the Ouija board, of would-be psychics.
What you do is, just relax and let your hand write anything
that comes into your mind. Then you imagine that you are
&quot;channelling&quot; someone else's thoughts &#8212; usually the thoughts
of a dead person, ghost, or spirit.
(Yes, this is the <i>channelling</i> that Shirley MacLaine would
make famous years later.)
Bill imagined that he wrote dictation from a Catholic priest who
had lived in the 1600 period in Barcelona, Spain.
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>
[I can't help but wonder: That priest must have spoken Spanish and
Latin while he was alive. When did he learn English? After he was
dead? Do ghosts do that? Why didn't the ghost of the Priest dictate
his thoughts in Latin, and leave it to Bill to get the messages
translated by one of his Catholic Priest friends like Father Dowling?
<p>
Which brings up a big question for all channellers: Why don't you
get your messages in the foreign languages that the dead people
spoke while they were alive?
Why do you only get messages in the language that you speak, like
English? Why doesn't Cleopatra dictate in ancient Egyptian, and
Joan of Arc in French? Isn't it convenient that the ghosts always
translate for you?<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Actually, Bill then came up with an answer for that one too.
Read on.</font>]
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then, Henrietta wrote, Wilson told Horace Crystal that he was
completing the work that Christ didn't finish, and, according to
Horace, he said he was
<a href="#Henrietta" target="_blank">the reincarnation of Christ</a>...
<p>

<p>
And it just goes on and on.
Shortly after the Wilsons moved into their Bedford Hills
home, they began to hold regular
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">spook sessions</a>&quot;.
Bill Wilson even set aside one downstairs room as the &quot;spook
room&quot; where the s&eacute;ances were held. (It is still there;
you can go visit the house <i>&quot;Stepping Stones&quot;</i> and
see the spook room &#8212; downstairs to the left &#8212; complete with bookshelves full
of occult books.)

An account published in the official A.A. history book,
<i>PASS IT ON</i>,
tells of a pre-breakfast conversation that Bill said he had with
three ghosts
during a visit to Nantucket in 1944,
ghosts whom Bill Wilson said were the spirits of &quot;three
distinct long-dead Nantucket citizens&quot;. (See <i>P.I.O.</i>, page 278.)

<p>
All of this sounds like just another veiled ego game: Bill Wilson
fancied himself an &quot;adept&quot;, a skilled psychic medium,
more spiritual, and more in contact with
the spirit world, than ordinary people, which supposedly raised
Bill above the level of his fellow alcoholics, and made him more
qualified to be their spiritual teacher.

<p>
<center>
<table border="4" bordercolor="blue" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" width="100%">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Actually, that story in <i>PASS IT ON</i> about the ghosts of
Nantucket looks a lot like a faked psychic stunt. The way that
Bill told the story is, his first morning in Nantucket, at the
home of acquaintances, while doing his morning meditation before
breakfast, he
was visited by three ghosts, who told Bill their names, among
other things.
Then, at breakfast, Bill announced to all present that he had had
a psychic experience, and had made contact with the spirits of
some long-dead Nantucket citizens. Bill stressed their names
over and over again, until everyone had the names memorized.
<p>
Then, after breakfast, they all went into town. In 
downtown Nantucket, there is a monument in the center of the town
square. On the base of it, Bill found the name of one of his ghosts &#8212; David Morrow.
Then, they looked into the Maritime Museum, and there, in a large open book
just inside the door, they found the other names that Bill had stressed at
breakfast.
And then, upstairs in the museum, there was a life-size portrait of Admiral Farragut
on the wall,
with a plaque that described the role that the Nantucket sailors played in
the Battle of Mobile Bay, which Bill Wilson said David Morrow had described to
him.
<p>
Bill claimed that that was proof that his contact with the spirits was real:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Therefore, the record shows that I had picked up pretty accurate
descriptions of three quite obscure and long-dead Nantucket citizens,
names no doubt gone from the minds of living people. There isn't even
a remote chance that I had at some earlier time read or heard about all
three of them, <i>ordinary</i> former <i>inhabitants</i> of the island.
Maybe <i>one</i>, but certainly not <i>three</i>.&quot;

(The italicized emphasis is Bill's.)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

What Bill did not tell us in the book <i>PASS IT ON</i> is precisely
when he got to Nantucket. If he arrived in town the previous afternoon (which is likely,
because he was doing <i>pre-breakfast</i> meditation, the first morning that he was
at his friend's house),
then he had plenty of opportunity to stop and look around the downtown
area for a few minutes. Pick a name off of the monument, and then
poke your head inside the Maritime Museum for a few minutes
and get a couple more names and a story
there, and you have all of the &quot;evidence&quot; that you need to
start talking to the old ghosts of Nantucket.
<p>
Isn't it odd how easily
Bill was able to find immediate verification of those supposedly
&quot;obscure&quot; and long-forgotten names with just a short stroll downtown?

<p>
That is actually a very common trick that phony psychics use to fool
audiences. All that is required is that you surreptitiously get some
special information before performing the stunt, information
that would be impossible for you to get during the stunt, so
that the audience will be fooled and amazed.
One phony psychic had assistants who would poke through the trash cans
of intended targets to get personal information about them,
and then those people would be amazed at how, during the
s&eacute;ances, the &quot;psychic&quot; could see so many personal
details of their lives just by &quot;looking into their hearts&quot;.
<p>
The crazy suicidal cult leader Jim Jones did it by having his assistants visit
people's houses the day before they were to be &quot;miraculously healed by
Jim Jones&quot;.  The assistants would describe the interiors of the houses
to Jim Jones, who would then, the next day, during the &quot;healing ceremony&quot;,
theatrically declare to the people,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I've never met you before. I've never been to your house.&quot;</font>
And then Jones would use his &quot;psychic powers&quot; to describe their houses,
which really wowed the audience.

would not be at all impressed with such a simplistic stunt.

<p>
<a name="spook_sessions"> </a>
But all of that dabbling in the occult was not just a joke, or just a
parlor trick to fool and amaze friends. Bill took it seriously, and
claimed that it was proof of the existence of the spirit world and of
spiritual entities like the A.A. &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As early as 1941, Bill and Lois were holding regular Saturday &quot;spook sessions&quot;
at Bedford Hills. One of the downstairs bedrooms was dubbed by them the
&quot;spook room&quot;;
here, they conducted many of their psychic experiments. Of one session with
a ouija board, Bill wrote this description:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The ouija board got moving in earnest. What followed was the fairly usual
experience &#8212; it was a strange m&eacute;lange of Aristotle, St. Francis, diverse
archangels with odd names, deceased friends &#8212; some in purgatory and others doing
nicely, thank you! There were malign and mischievous ones of all descriptions,
telling of vices quite beyond my ken, even as former alcoholics. Then, the seemingly
virtuous entities would elbow them out with messages of comfort, information,
advice &#8212; and sometimes just sheer nonsense.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill would lie on the couch in the living room, semi-withdrawn, but not in a trance,
and &quot;receive&quot; messages, sometimes a word at a time, sometimes a letter at
a time. Anne B., neighbor and &quot;spook&quot; circle regular, would write the
material on a pad. Lois describes one of the more dramatic of these sessions:<br>
<a name="Rockefeller_07"> </a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Bill would lie down on the couch. He would 'get' these things. He kept doing
it every week or so. Each time, certain people would 'come in.' Sometimes, it would
be new ones, and they'd carry on some story. There would be long sentences; word
by word would come through. This time, instead of word by word, it was letter by
letter. Anne put them down letter by letter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I had three years of Latin. I said, 'This looks like Latin to me.' So Bill asked
Dick Richardson [of the Rockefeller Foundation], who was quite a student of Latin.
He asked him what this was. Was this Latin? He said yes. (Bill knew no Latin except
what he got in his law course. He always regretted it.)&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill continues the story:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;[Richardson] was a fine classical scholar. Astonished, he finally looked up
and exclaimed, 'Where on earth did you ever get this?' I demurred, but asked him if
the Latin was readable. 'Yes,' said he. 'It is perfectly good, though difficult.
Looks like the beginning of what was probably intended to be an allegorical account
of the founding of the Christian church in Italy.' I then asked him if he saw
any grammatical errors in the paragraphs. He looked again and reported that the
Latin looked all right to him. Since he was an old friend, I told him the story of
its production, at which he was deeply impressed.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
Obviously, the simplest explanation is that Bill Wilson went to either the public
library in New York City or the library at Columbia University, and found
an ancient manuscript or an old book and memorized a few paragraphs from it, and then
recited them during a s&eacute;ance. He didn't even need to get the Latin
pronunciation correct, because he recited the document letter by letter.

[Powers, co-author of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>]
</font>
and his wife Ginny were regular members
of the &quot;spooking&quot; circle.
This is Tom's story of how he became involved with them:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I was a problem to these people, because I was an atheist, and an atheist is,
by definition, a materialist. I mean, you can't be an atheist unless you're a materialist,
and a materialist is, by definition, someone who does not believe in other worlds.
Now these people, Bill and Dr. Bob, believed vigorously and aggressively.
They were working away at the spiritualism; it was not just a hobby.
And it related to A.A., because the big problem in A.A. is that for a materialist
it's hard to buy the program. I had a hell of a time getting on the program.
Couldn't get it through my head that there was any God, because God was a supernatural
being. And there ain't any supernatural beings, and everybody knows that.
So the thing was not at all divorced from A.A. It was very serious for everybody.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
According to Tom, Bill never did anything that was not in some way connected with
A.A. and with his own spiritual growth. He was, as Tom put it,
very &quot;one-pointed.&quot;<br>

Bill Wilson's long-time secretary Nell Wing told the story this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the early forties, Bill and Lois often held meetings &#8212; or &quot;spook sessions,&quot;
as they termed them &#8212; in a small downstairs bedroom at Stepping Stones.
A.A. friends, a couple of Rockefeller people, and even some Bedford Hills
neighbors frequently participated in these sessions and experienced unusual
phenomena. For example, during one evening sitting, Bill spelled out slowly,
letter by letter, a paragraph or two from a sermon by St. Boniface which was
verified by Rev. Willard Richardson.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of Bill's most convincing experiences took place in 1947 during their
first visit to Nantucket Island. They arrived at night and Bill rose early
the next morning. While sitting alone in his host's kitchen with a cup of
coffee, he had lengthy conversations with three Nantucketers who had lived
more than a hundred years before: a whaler, a sailor who said his name was
David Morrow and that he had been killed serving uner Admiral Farragut at
the Battle of Mobile Bay, and a sea captain named Pettingill. &quot;Just for fun,
I told this story at breakfast,&quot; Bill shared later with a friend, &quot;making
pointed reference to the names.&quot; Their host was skeptical to say the least,
and the matter was dropped.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The next day, Bill, Lois, and their hosts were meeting others for a picnic,
having set a rendezvous at the head of Nantucket's main street.
At that spot was a small monument to Nantucket's fallen in the Civil War,
and at the foot of the monument the names of the dead were chiseled.
One of them was David Morrow. Bill called for his host's attention to it.
The next day, they visited the Nantucket Whaling Museum for the first time.
There, in an open book, were the names of the masters of the old whaling
vessels. One of them was Pettingill. &quot;There isn't even a remote chance that
I had at some time read or heard about all three of these ordinary former
inhabitants of the island,&quot; Bill wrote. &quot;Maybe one but certainly not
three.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>12</sup></font><br>

<font size="-1"><i>Grateful To Have Been There</i>, Nell Wing, pages 60-61.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<li> First off, where did Nell Wing get the idea that Bill Wilson had arrived in
Nantucket at night, and not in the afternoon or evening just before the Maritime
Museum closed? Bill did not write that in his account of the story in
<i>PASS IT ON: The Story of Bill Wilson and How the A.A. Message Reached the
World</i>. Bill did not say when he and Lois arrived in Nantucket.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill must have told Nell Wing that later on, which would have helped to cover up
how he faked the stunt. Notice how both Nell Wing and Bill kept emphasizing
&quot;the first time&quot;, as in &quot;the first time Bill visited
Nantucket&quot;, and &quot;the first time they visited the museum&quot;,
which was obviously supposed to hide how the stunt was done.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides which, Bill's arrival time in downtown Nantucket, and his arrival time
at his friend's house were probably two different times.
Bill could easily have arrived in downtown Nantucket in
the late afternoon, and then spent a while looking around, and then arrived at this
friend's house after the Museum closed...

<p>
<li> Bill didn't tell his breakfast companions about the ghosts as a joke.
That was a deliberately faked psychic stunt.
Bill Wilson always had to be special, ahead of
the other people, the Number One Man, being a gifted psychic, more spiritual than
other people, seeing and hearing ghosts when others could not.

<p>
<li> Notice how Bill arranged the rendezvous with his friends at the monument.
That way, his friends had to see the monument and the names on it.
Then, when they arrived, Bill pointed out the name David Morrow to them.
Bill already knew that the name was there.

<p>
<li> Bill Wilson flat-out lied when he said that there wasn't
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;even a remote chance that I had at some time read or heard about
all three of these ordinary former inhabitants of the island.&quot;</i></font><br>
It is highly likely that he did it the previous afternoon or evening.
<p>
<li> And let us not forget Boniface. Father Ed Dowling and Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Boniface" target="_blank">corresponded about Boniface</a>.
Bill claimed that he was talking to the ghost of a
medieval monk, and Fr. Dowling said that it sounded like it could be
the Apostle of Germany, but that Bill might be messing with spirits that
were deceiving him.
Again, all that Bill
had to do to fake that &quot;psychic experience&quot; was
go to either the New York City Public Library or the Columbia
University library and find a manuscript or old book about
Boniface that contained a few paragraphs of
one of his sermons, hand-copy and memorize the text, and then recite it
during a s&eacute;ance. This story doesn't tell us whether Boniface's sermon was
in Latin or English. Either way, all that Bill had to do was move the pointer of the
Ouija board to the proper letters, one after another.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And how did Rev. Willard Richardson later verify the text as coming from Boniface?
Quite possibly by reading the same old book as Bill Wilson did.<br>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>If it were really the spirit of St. Boniface, why would Boniface waste a precious opportunity
to communicate with humanity by just repeating one of his old sermons that had
already been written down and printed in a book? Why wouldn't Boniface send us a new message,
something that he had learned from five centuries of dwelling in Heaven?&quot;</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ah, but if Boniface did that, then Bill Wilson would have a hard time getting it verified
as coming from Boniface, wouldn't he?
</font>

</ol>

<p>
Do you think Bill Wilson worried about people discovering that he was a fraud?
That would explain a lot of his paranoia and chronic depression.

Bill Wilson was messing around with the occult and
talking to ghosts in s&eacute;ances so much
that other A.A. members were very disturbed by it.
One, Sumner Campbell,
wrote to a man whom they all respected, C. S. Lewis
at Cambridge University in England, describing Bill Wilson's spook sessions and
asking his opinion. Lewis wrote back with total disapproval, saying,
<font color="blue">
&quot;This is necromancy. Have nothing to do with it.&quot;</font>
Bill Wilson ignored the criticism and continued
conducting his s&eacute;ances and communicating with the dead people each evening
anyway.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt27">27</a></sup></font>

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="Henrietta"> </a>
Some other people who knew Bill Wilson while he was alive also
said that Bill was not quite right in the head.
I found a letter from Henrietta Seiberling to Clarence Snyder
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160902122626/http://www.aapubliccontroversy.com/hen/" target="_blank">
on the Internet</a>
<font size="-1">
[<a href="orange-Henrietta_Seiberling.html" target="_blank">Local Copy Here</a>]</font>,
written in 1952,
which is some of the strongest condemnation of Bill Wilson around &#8212;
she said that Bill was deluded and imagined himself all kinds of things.

<p>
To recap a little history, Henrietta Seiberling was the woman who
introduced Bill Wilson to Dr. Robert Smith, and was directly
responsible for starting the whole Alcoholics Anonymous organization.
It was Henrietta who answered the phone on that fateful evening in
Akron, Ohio, in the spring of 1935, when Bill Wilson was at the Mayflower Hotel
and afraid that he would relapse, so he was calling around to find another
alcoholic member of the Oxford Group to talk to.
Bill telephoned Rev. Walter F. Tunks, who was one of the staunchest Oxford Group members
in Arkon, and Tunks referred Bill to another fellow Oxford Grouper who referred Bill
to Henrietta Seiberling and Dr. Robert H. Smith,
two other Oxford Group members. (There was nothing amazing or miraculous how everybody
from Rev. Tunks to Henritta and Dr. Bob were all Oxford Groupers, like some apocryphal
stories say. Rev. Sam Shoemaker &quot;changed&quot; Rev. Tunks into an Oxford Grouper, and
Shoemaker certainly told Bill to call Rev. Tunks while he was in Akron.)
<p>
Henrietta arranged an appointment for Bill to see her friend Dr. Bob the next day
(because Dr. Bob was already passing-out drunk that day).
Then, the next evening, Dr. Bob didn't drink while
talking with Bill. Henrietta was so impressed that she arranged
for Bill to stay in Akron longer and longer, just to help
keep Dr. Bob sober. Bill ended up staying for all of the summer
of 1935, living rent free and happily unemployed, getting free
food and cigarettes and walking-around money from somewhere.
Bill and Bob started their &quot;Alcoholic Squad&quot; of The
Oxford Group during that time, the &quot;anonymous bunch of
alcoholics&quot; that would eventually become Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Henrietta Seiberling really loved Bill Wilson in the summer of 1935,
and considered him a &quot;God-send&quot; for his help in sobering
up Doctor Bob.  So what made her hate him so much later on?
Well, Henrietta says it was Bill Wilson stealing the
money, and trying to steal the book. That is,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">stealing the <i>Big Book</i>
publishing fund</a>, and
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#grabby" target="_blank">the copyright of the
<i>Big Book</i></a>.
Henrietta Seiberling isn't alone in that opinion: Doctor Bob's daughter,
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith" target="_blank">Sue Smith Windows, also says</a>
that Bill Wilson took the money and
set up his own company, outside of the fellowship, and fraudulently
copyrighted the <i>Big Book</i> in his own name, as the sole author,
without the knowledge or permission
of Doctor Bob or any of the other Akron members, and without
the permission of the book's other co-authors.
<p>

This letter was written about 17 years later, in 1952, after Henrietta
had had <b>plenty</b> of time to get to know Bill Wilson better,
and observe him at work.  It was written
to Clarence Snyder, who had founded one of the first Cleveland, Ohio,
groups of A.A., and who was the author of the <i>Big Book</i> chapter,
&quot;<i>The Home Brewmeister</i>&quot;.
This is what Henrietta Seiberling ended up saying about Bill Wilson:<br>

</ul>
<p>
And that comes from an insider, one of the principal people in the
creation of Alcoholics Anonymous... Henrietta said, point blank,
that Bill Wilson was suffering from a delusional disorder,
as well as behaving very badly:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I don't know what is going on in the poor deluded fellow's mind&quot;<br>
</font>

and<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He imagines himself all kinds of things&quot;</font>.<br>

<p>
That also seems to have been the opinion of
her friends <a href="orange-cleve1944.html" target="_blank">Clarence Snyder</a>,
Bill Dotson, and Horace Crystal, all of whom were members of the so-called
&quot;<a href="#org100" target="_blank">First 100</a>&quot;.
<p>
<a name="Luke16"> </a>
Henrietta's references to the sixteenth chapter of Luke point to the
story of a dishonest manager who financially cheated his master. The story
is summed up with the lines:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Whoever is faithful in small matters will be faithful in large ones;
whoever is dishonest in small matters will be dishonest in large ones.
If then, you have not been honest in handling worldly wealth, how
can you be trusted with true wealth? And if you have not been faithful
with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what belongs to you?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No servant can be the slave of two masters; such a slave will hate one
and love the other or will be loyal to one and despise the other.
You cannot serve both God and money.

<p>
The statement above, about Bill Wilson imagining himself to be the
reincarnation of Jesus Christ, is not the only example of such
thinking. In Bill's speech at the memorial service for Dr. Bob,
Bill said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So then Dr. Bob and I talked to the man on the bed, Bill Dotson, who some
of you have heard, A.A. No. 3. Here was another man who said he couldn't
get well, his case was too tough, much tougher than ours, besides he knew
all about religion. Well, here it was, one drunk talking with another,
in fact, two drunks talking to one. The very next day, the man on the bed
got out of his bed, and he picked it up and walked, and he has stayed sober
ever since. A.A. No. 3, the man on the bed.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">&#8212; Bill Wilson,
<a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html#cripple_walks" target="_blank">speaking at the Memorial service</a>
for Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those who are familiar with the Gospels will immediately recognize the story
of Jesus healing the cripple by the pool, John 5:2.
Jesus healed a crippled guy, and he just got up off of the bed
that he had been laying on for years, and picked up his bed, and
walked away. In this alcoholic version of the story,
Bill Wilson cast himself and Dr. Bob in the place of Jesus Christ.
They had become the magic healers who made the sick man get up, and pick up
his bed and walk.
(Actually, that is highly unlikely, because the bed was really a hospital
bed, and such beds are big and heavy, and the nurses don't let
you take them.)
See page 157 of the <i>Big Book</i>, in the chapter
called <i>&quot;A Vision For You&quot;</i>, for the story of
Bill Dotson, &quot;the man on the bed&quot;.
<p>
Note that Bill Wilson did not say that God performed a miracle, and
healed Bill Dotson, or that Jesus healed the guy:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, here it was, one drunk talking with another, in
fact, two drunks talking to one.&quot;<br>
</font>
is the magic that did it. (Notice how Bill Wilson almost forgot to
include Dr. Bob in the credits.)
<p>

But since Dr. Bob was dead when Bill spoke at the memorial service,
that only left Bill Wilson to be the Messiah and continue the
miraculous healings, &quot;one drunk talking with another&quot;,
making the cripples get out of bed and walk...

<a name="belladonna"> </a>
Belladonna is an atropine powder derived from the leaves and
roots of <i>Atropa belladonna</i>, a poisonous Eurasian plant
popularly known as &quot;Deadly Nightshade.&quot; Henbane is a similar
plant in the same family. It yields the
drug hyoscyamus, which sedates the central nervous system.
Another well-known member of the
family is Datura, also known as Jimson Weed, or Loco Weed,
which was popularized by Carlos Casteneda in his book
<i>The Teachings of Don Juan.</i> Datura is likewise a poisonous
hallucinogen.

<p>
All of the plants in the nightshade family get you high the same
way: they are all deadly poisonous, and they poison you so much
that you end up in a state where you have one foot in the grave
and one foot in the land of the living. And you hallucinate your
brains out. Dosage is critical. Overdoses are fatal.

<p>
One friend who did Datura said, &quot;If you
are going to do it, get three of
your biggest, strongest friends to lock you in a closet for the
duration, because you are going to be completely out of your
head, totally disconnected from reality. Whatever you imagine
becomes real. If you think of being in a sailing ship, then
suddenly, you are. You can look out the porthole, and you can
look around and see every piece of wood in the ceiling and
walls all around you. It is all totally real.&quot;

<p>
Fortunately, I passed on that particular one. My friend had diarrhea
for three months after drinking some tea of Datura, and he
got off easy. Other people blew out their livers or kidneys.
The stuff is just unbelievably toxic. Every part of the plant,
including leaves, stems, flowers, seeds, and roots, is poisonous.
Don't mess with it.

&quot;Dr. Silkworth's belladonna cure&quot; was
actually a joint recipe of the entrepreneur Charles Towns (an insurance salesman from Georgia)
and Dr. Alexander Lambert,
all three of whom worked together at Charlie Towns' hospital in New York City.
It was a drug cocktail made up of belladonna, henbane,
zanthoxylum (which eases gastrointestinal discomfort),
barbiturates, megavitamins, morphine, and some other
ingredients.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<u>The Hospital's Founding</u>: With a background in farming, railroading, life
insurance, and the stock market, Charles B. Towns &#8212; according to his own
self-constructed mythology &#8212; became interested in addiction through a mysterious
stranger he met in a bar shortly after he had left Georgia in 1901 to seek his
fortunes in New York City. The unnamed stranger told Towns that he had the
formula for a cure for the drug habits that had been discovered by a country
doctor, and that he and Towns could make a lot of money selling the
cure.<font size="-1"><sup>36</sup></font>
Intrigued with the possibilities, Towns began reading about addiction and
experimenting with the stranger's formula. A racetrack worker whom Towns
persuaded to take the cure &#8212; and who was then held against his will until
the cure was complete &#8212; became Towns' first success.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This serendipitious beginning led in 1901 &#8212; the year of Leslie E. Keeley's death &#8212;
to the opening of the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcoholic Addictions.<br>
<hr>
<font size="-1">
36. It is impossible not to consider that this &quot;country doctor&quot;
was Dr. Leslie Keeley and that the Towns treatment was an adaptation of
the Keeley cure.<br>

So Charles Towns' &quot;belladonna cure&quot; for morphine and opium
addiction &#8212; which he later declared was also good for treating
alcoholism &#8212; was actually just a quack medicine recipe that he got
from a guy in a bar.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At this point, a mysterious man whispered to him, &quot;I have got a cure
for the drug habits, morphine, opium, heroin, codeine, alcohol &#8212; any of 'em.
We can make a lot of money out of it.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>156,p.17</sup></font>
Towns was skeptical and asked his own doctor for advice. His doctor
stated that the &quot;cure&quot; was ridiculous, but this type of challenge
interested Towns and he placed ads seeking &quot;drug fiends&quot;
who wanted to be cured.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Towns found a patient and took the &quot;Whisperer,&quot; the &quot;fiend&quot;
and himself to the old Abingdon Square Hotel, along with three small vials
of medicine. After a few hours of extreme pain, the &quot;fiend&quot;
wanted to leave, but Towns physically restrained him and gave him a strong
sedative. A doctor and stomach pump were sent for, as the patient became
violently ill. After forty-eight hours, the patient was able to leave.
Towns and his accomplice decided the &quot;cure&quot; needed additional
refinement, so Towns began reading all the known literature on drug addiction
and alcoholism. Unable to find any more patients, he kidnapped a racetrack agent
and forced him through the treatment, which was successful.
His reputation soon spread through New York's criminal underworld and
he treated many addicted gangsters. During this time, he eliminated the
distressing features of the original formula.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Towns believed the formula was now ready for more widespread use and he
interested Dr. Alexander Lambert, professor of clinical medicine at
Cornell University Medical College and a visiting physician to Bellevue
Hospital, in his formula. Lambert was one of then-President Theodore Roosevelt's
physicians and he began telling various government officials about
the &quot;Towns Cure.&quot;<br>

When an alcoholic was admitted in the midst of his spree,

the patient to sleep, and the only medication which preceded his

the best results was the following:

one or two drachms of paraldehyde. If these were not effective within

him:

There were a lot of powerful mind-altering drugs in all of that:
belladonna, morphine, chloral hydrate, paraldehyde, hyoscyamine,
strychnine, and apomorphine. Quite a trip.
<p>
And that <i>Hydrargyri chloridi mitis</i>, an ingredient of the &quot;C.C. Pills&quot;,
is a mercury compound like mercuric or mercurous chloride.
It is terribly poisonous and causes violent diarrhea and
vomiting, &quot;in accordance with the old theory that this would purge the
person from whatever ill was [present] at the time...&quot;. (Thanks to
<a href="orange-letters123.html#mercury" target="_blank">Petri</a> for that note.)
<p>
And the strangest drug included there has to be the &quot;Extracti resinae podophylli&quot; in the
&quot;Blue Mass&quot; pills. Podophyllum resin is a powerful tissue killer that is good for
removing venereal warts.
That stuff is so caustic that it will eat a wart right off of your body.
Heaven only knows what it has to do with treating alcoholism.
And I sure wouldn't want to swallow it.

Now I'm not implying that Bill Wilson was a deep throat, but I guess we can safely assume that
his throat and digestive tract were free of venereal warts.

Dr. Lambert gave these instructions for administration of the drug
mixture:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The amount necessary to give is judged by the physiologic
action of the belladonna it contains. When the face
becomes flushed, the throat dry, and the pupils of the
eyes dilated, you must cut down your mixture or cease
giving it altogether, until these symptoms pass.
You must, however, push this mixture until these symptoms
appear, or you will not obtain a clear cut cessation of
the desire for the narcotic.<br>

<p>
Dr. Lambert and Charles Towns were quite aware of the hallucinogenic properties
of belladonna:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Close observation is necessary in treating the alcoholic in regard to
the symptoms of the intoxication of belladonna, as alcoholics are sensitive
to the effects of belladonna delirium. According to Lambert, it is a less
furious and less pugnacious delirium than that for alcohol. The patients are
more persistent and more insistent in their ideas and more incisive in their
speech concerning hallucinations. The hallucinations of alcohol are usually
those of an occupation delirium; those of belladonna are not. The various
hallucinations of alcohol follow each other so quickly that a man is busily
occupied in observing them one after another. The belladonna delirium is apt
to be confined to one or two ideas on which the patient is very insistent.
If these symptoms of belladonna intoxication occur, of course, the specific
must be discontinued; then beginning again with the original smaller
dose.<font size="-1"><sup>(210, pp. 987-988)</sup></font>
Towns believed the attending physician would find it most difficult to
differentiate between alcoholic delirium and belladonna
delirium.<font size="-1"><sup>(208, p. 7)</sup></font><br>

In addition, Dr. Lambert liked to put alcoholics to sleep as soon as they came in.
He usually used chloral hydrate or paraldehyde, but &quot;Lambert also believed
it wise to give most alcoholics 1/60 to 1/30 of a gram of strychnine every four
hours.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt14">14</a></sup></font>

Those who remember the psychedelic sixties will remember that LSD was sometimes
laced with the poison strychnine because it enhanced the colors and the vividness of the
hallucinations.

That's the &quot;alcoholism treatment&quot; that Dr. Silkworth gave to Bill Wilson
at Towns' Hospital &#8212; four times altogether, in a little over a year.

Even before the Ice Age, belladonnas were used world-wide in religious ceremonies.
The drug promoted babbling trances in shamans and other human oracles...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Belladonna had two salient advantages for the cure specialists.
Because it annulled morphine's mental clarity and euphoria by replacing it
with a drowsy, babbling disconnected stupor, it became established in
science as a morphine anti-toxin (artificial Autotoxin), providing a
conceptually elegant framework for ridding the body, once and forever,
of every addiction-promoting substance. And belladonna had the important
advantage of keeping patients comatose: they wouldn't even <i>think</i> of
sneaking out of the ward, being entirely occupied in talking to their ancestors,
and flying through the sky with weird animals.<br>

<a name="spiritualexperience"> </a>
This is Robert Thomsen's description of Bill Wilson's &quot;spiritual
experience&quot; that occurred December 13 or 14, 1934, after two
or three days of detoxing and getting the belladonna cure, and having
Ebby Thacher, Rowland Hazard, Shep Cornell, and other Oxford Groupers
indoctrinating him while he was tripping:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
His fingers relaxed a little on the footboard [of the bed],
his arms slowly reached out and up. &quot;I want,&quot; he
said aloud. &quot;I want...&quot;

<a name="wanttolive"><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ever since infancy</a>, they said, he'd been reaching out
this way, arms up, fingers spread, and as far back as he could
remember he'd been saying just that. But always before it
had been an unfinished sentence. Now it had its ending.
<i>He wanted to live.</i> He would do anything, anything,
to be allowed to go on living.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, God,&quot; he cried, and it was the sound not of a man,
but of a trapped and crippled animal. &quot;If there is a
God, show me. Show me. Give me some sign.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As he formed the words, in that very instant he was
aware first of a light, a great white light that filled the
room, then he suddenly seemed caught up in a kind of joy, an
ecstasy such as he would never find words to describe. It
was as though he were standing high on a mountaintop and a
strong clear wind blew against him, around him, through him
&#8212; but it seemed a wind not of air, but of spirit &#8212; and as
this happened he had the feeling that he was stepping into
another world, a new world of consciousness, and everywhere
now there was a wondrous feeling of Presence which all his
life he had been seeking. Nowhere had he ever felt so
complete, so satisfied, so embraced.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This happened. And it happened as suddenly and as
definitely as one may receive a shock from an electrode, or
feel heat when a hand is placed close to a flame. Then when
it passed, when the light slowly dimmed, and the ecstasy
subsided &#8212; and whether this was a matter of minutes or much
longer he never knew; he was beyond any reckoning of time &#8212;
the sense of Presence was still there about him, within him.

And with it there was still another sense, a sense of rightness.
No matter how wrong things seemed to be, they were as they
were meant to be. There could be no doubt of ultimate order
in the universe, the cosmos was not dead matter, but a part
of the living Presence, just as he was part of it.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now, in place of the light, the exaltation, he was filled
with a peace such as he had never known. He had heard of
men who'd tried to open the universe to themselves; he had
opened himself to the universe. He had heard men say there
was a bit of God in everyone, but this feeling that he was a
part of God, himself a living part of the higher power, was
a new and revolutionary feeling.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">&#8212; Robert Thomsen, <i>Bill W.</i>, 1975, pp. 222-223.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Note the power of suggestion at work. Ebby Thacher had been working on Bill for
weeks, trying to get him to join the Oxford Group. Bill had decided to give Ebby's
&quot;spiritual&quot; treatment program for alcoholism a try,
because he knew that he would die if he kept on drinking.
Just a few days earlier, he had gone to Ebby's
Oxford Group meeting at Rev. Sam Shoemaker's Calvary Mission, and
had &quot;given himself to God&quot; during the service.
Then he went to Charles Towns' hospital to detox and quit drinking. Ebby and other
Oxford Groupers
came and worked on him some more in the hospital, indoctrinating him with
more Oxford Group dogma and jabber about God.
Then, when the hallucinogens hit, Bill saw &quot;God&quot; &#8212; just what he had been
programmed to see.

<p>
(Also see the description of Ebby Thacher playing
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Wilsons_guilt" target="newwin" target="_blank">guilt-tripping
mind games</a> on Bill Wilson to cause him to flip out and have his
&quot;spiritual experience&quot;.)


<p>
<a name="aacoa_experience"> </a>
In the A.A. book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> (1957)
Bill Wilson described his experience this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All at once I found myself crying out, &quot;If there is a God,
let Him show himself! I am ready to do anything, anything!&quot;<br>
<a name="preachers"> </a> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Suddenly the room lit up with a great white light. I was
caught up in an ecstasy which there are no words to describe.
It seemed to me in my mind's eye, that I was on a mountain
and that a wind not of air but of spirit was blowing. And then
it burst upon me that I was a free man. Slowly the ecstasy
subsided. I lay there on the bed, but now for a time I was in
another world, a new world of consciousness... and I thought
to myself, &quot;So this is the God of the preachers!&quot;
A great peace stole over me...<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>
(1957), William G. Wilson, page 63.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the book <i>Bill W.: My First 40 Years</i>, Bill Wilson described
his religious experience this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terrifying darkness had become complete. In agony of spirit,
I again thought of the cancer of alcoholism which had now consumed
me in mind and spirit, and soon the body. But what of the
Great Physician? For a moment, I suppose, the last trace of my
obstinacy was crushed out as the abyss yawned.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I remember saying to myself, &quot;I'll do anything, anything at
all. If there be a Great Physician, I'll call on him.&quot;
Then, with neither faith nor hope I cried out, &quot;If there
be a God, let him show himself.&quot;
The effect was instant, electric. Suddenly my room blazed with
an indescribably white light. I was seized with an ecstasy
beyond description. I have no words for this. Every joy I had
known was pale by comparison. The light, the ecstasy.
I was conscious of nothing else for a time.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then, seen in the mind's eye, there was a mountain. I stood upon
its summit where a great wind blew. A wind, not of air, but of
spirit. In great, clean strength it blew right through me.
Then came the blazing thought, &quot;You are a free man.&quot;
I know not at all how long I remained in this state, but finally
the light and the ecstasy subsided. I again saw the wall of my
room. As I became more quiet a great peace stole over me, and
this was accompanied by a sensation difficult to describe.
I became acutely conscious of a presence which seemed like a
veritable sea of living spirit. I lay on the shores of a new
world. &quot;This,&quot; I thought, &quot;must be the great
reality. The God of the preachers.&quot;<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Savoring my new world, I remained in this state for a long
time. I seemed to be possessed by the absolute, and the
curious conviction deepened that no matter how wrong things
seemed to be, there would be no question of the ultimate
rightness of God's universe. For the first time I felt that
I really belonged. I knew that I was loved and could love
in return. I thanked God who had given me a glimpse of His
absolute Self. Even though a pilgrim upon an uncertain
highway, I need be concerned no more, for I had glimpsed
the great beyond.<br>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Save a brief hour of doubt next to come, these feelings
and convictions, no matter what the vicissitude, have never
deserted me since. For a reason that I cannot begin to comprehend,
this great and sudden gift of grace has always been mine.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.: My First 40 Years</i>, William Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>

Note that Mr. Wilson implied that he had the power to summon up the Spirit of God,
just by demanding that God show himself, just like how socerers or wizards
are supposedly able to summon up demons:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Demon XXX, In the Name of Baelzebub and All Of The Forces Of Darkness, I command you to appear!&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Ordinary sorcerers and wizards have to settle for summoning
up ordinary demons by name, but not Bill Wilson.
Bill Wilson waved his arms in the air and commanded
God Almighty Himself to appear (and Bill didn't even say
&quot;Please&quot;):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<ul>
<li> &quot;If there is a God, show me. Show me. Give me some sign.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;If there is a God, let Him show himself!&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;If there be a God, let him show himself!&quot;<br>
</ul>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
[Whenever I try that trick, it doesn't work for me.

</i></font>

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<p>
Oddly enough, even though Bill Wilson became a fanatic at pushing
his own point of view, he didn't even have a point of view to call
his own after his drug-induced &quot;vision of God&quot;.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The next day, roughly December 14 or 15, 1934, one of his friends
in The Oxford Group, either Ebby Thacher or Rowland Hazard, gave
him William James' book, <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>,
to read while he was in the hospital, and that is where Bill got
the idea of &quot;deflation at depth&quot;, of having life-altering
religious experiences while in great despair, great pain, and utter
hopelessness.
(Although at least one critic has reported that the phrase &quot;deflation at depth&quot;
is not present anywhere in James' book. William James did not say that the
way to induce religious or spiritual experiences was to crush or
&quot;compress&quot; people's egos.
Apparently, Bill Wilson was just seeing what he wished to see.)

<p><li> Then, Rowland
(<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland" target="_blank">allegedly</a>) told Bill
about the famous Swiss
psychiatrist Carl Jung suggesting to him that he substitute religious
mania for alcoholism.

<p><li> And then Ebby converted Bill to
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Buchmanism</a>,
via The Oxford Group Movement.
They indoctrinated Bill with all of the standard beliefs and
tenets of Buchmanism.
</ul>

<p> Bill absorbed all of that, and then set out to convert the world.
In his mind, he was the only one with all of the answers, and he
felt that God had chosen him for that messianic mission. He was
literally out to
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt022" target="_blank">
make converts of the whole world</a>, and he said so.
Bill felt that saving all of the alcoholics was just the first step
in world conquest:<br>

<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
The original version of Step 12 made it clear that <i>everybody</i> was fair game for recruiting
into Bill Wilson's religion:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
12. <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience">Having had a

we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics,
and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
<a name="recruit_family"> </a>
Then Bill Wilson tried to recruit the entire family into his new church:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should
neglect his family. You should continue to be friendly to them.
The family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept
and practice spiritual principles, there is a much better chance
that the head of the family will recover. And even though he continues
to drink, the family will find life more bearable.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 7, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue"></i>
Note that Bill suddenly changed the advertised effect of his &quot;spiritual&quot;
Twelve-Step program from making alcoholics quit drinking to just making
the family's life &quot;more bearable&quot;.
Are the 12 steps really a program for recovery from alcoholic drinking, or are
they actually something else, like the family's religion?
</i></font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</blockquote>

<p>
Yes indeed, <font color="#9F0000"><b>&quot;And besides...&quot;</b></font>
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>And besides, even if the program doesn't work very well for
actually getting alcoholics off of alcohol, it will get a bunch of other people
seeking and doing the Will of God in a Buchmanite cult religion,

</i></font>


<!----------------------------------------------------------
<P>
And Bill's followers have tried hard to make that ambition a reality, cloning the
Twelve-Step program into a couple of hundred other groups that will
supposedly
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">treat almost every condition imaginable</a>,
which makes everyone
in the world a candidate for twelve-step salvation, in one guise or
another, for some disease or other, real or imagined.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The first clone was Al-Anon, for the wives and children of alcoholics.
<LI> And then there was Alateen, just for the teenagers.
<LI> Then there was ACOA, Adult Children of Alcoholics, where you can
confess your miserable choice of parents.
<LI> Then they started 12-Step groups for drug addicts and compulsive gamblers.
<LI> Then it got
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">really ridiculous</a>, with groups
that are downright bizarre, groups to &quot;treat but not cure&quot;
high blood pressure, Hepatitis C, diabetes, chronic illness, compulsive
shopping, over-eating, schizophrenia, and being the partner of a sex addict, all
by doing the Twelve Steps and confessing all of your sins,
defects of character, and moral shortcomings...
</ul>
<P>
You would have to be really crazy to think that doing the Twelve
Steps will cure schizophrenia. But, come to think of it, that's just
how the con works, isn't it?

Baba Ram Dass (the former Professor Richard Alpert of Harvard University)
had this to say to people who have religious or spiritual experiences:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Don't be psychotic: Watch it. Watch it.
<p>
That psychosis business is an interesting business. If
you go through the doorway too fast, and you're not ready
for it, you're bound hand and foot and thrown into outer
darkness.
<p>
You may land anywhere and lots of people end up in
mental hospitals. The reason they do is: They went through
the door with their ego on, and:
<p>
&quot;Wow! I've been invited to the wedding feast.

<p>
&quot;I mean dig me! Sam Jones!

<p>

That only when you have been born again do you enter the
Kingdom of Heaven. So, they've gone in on the first round
and what happens is they go on a huge ego trip, and it's
called the Messianic Complex. It's called Paranoia,
Delusions of Grandeur.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">&#8212; Baba Ram Dass, <i>Be Here Now</i>, 1971, pp. 97-98.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
As you may have guessed from the above quote of Ram Dass, I
am not dismissing Bill
Wilson's spiritual experience as just a drug-induced
hallucination. No way, Jos&eacute;. Being a good
child of The Sixties, I believe that you can get real spiritual
or religious experiences in quite a variety of ways,
including fasting, chanting, meditation, yoga, sitting zazen, or
consuming various herbs, fungi, or
other organic chemicals. And some people even manage to do it
with funny stuff like dancing,
surfing, or making love, or &#8212; extremely dangerous &#8212; delirium
tremens. To me, anything that works is valid.
<p>
Please note that none of those means gives you any
guarantees at all; most of the time, none
of them, including drugs, really works for getting a spiritual
experience. It takes a lot more than
just an exercise or a dose to produce such an experience. The
person's mind set is critically
important, and setting is probably critical too. &quot;Mind
set&quot; may include years of preparation, or
even a lifetime of accumulated karma. (Some people would say
&quot;many lifetimes.&quot;) And then
there just seems to be an element of luck. (Or, if you don't
like the word &quot;luck&quot;, then maybe
cosmic good fortune, or good karma, or grace, or something.)
Anyway, when it happens, it is great.
<p>
It seems obvious to me that Bill Wilson had some kind of an experience.
He was allegedly changed from a drinking-to-die alcoholic to a
life-long teetotaler in just one
evening. That would have been a very strong vision,
if he really stayed sober, and we don't count
the years of taking LSD and other drugs.
<p>
And he was taking a strong enough dose: just delirium
tremens alone can have you hallucinating and tripping
your brains out, and seeing pink elephants and bugs crawling all over you,
and when you add three or four days of consuming
<a href="#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna and henbane</a> on
top of it, you have a dose sufficient to have you hallucinating
elephants of any color or stripe
you wish. The accumulated brain damage from his years of
drinking is also an unknown factor,
and adding the morphine, tranquilizers, barbiturates, strychnine,
megavitamins, and unspecified other
psychoactive drugs just seems like frosting on the cake, and
Heaven only knows what they all did in combination.
I'm certainly not surprised that he was tripping and hallucinating.
<p>
<a name="ftnt06_ret"> </a>
But as Ram Dass has pointed out, there are some inherent dangers in
forcing a visionary experience before its time, like getting cast
into <a href="#outerdark" target="_blank">outer darkness</a>, paranoia, delusions
of grandeur, and a messianic
complex.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font>
He should know.
Lots of people were getting a little funny on LSD back in the
sixties. (Okay, maybe <i><b>a lot</b></i> funny.) So it isn't like
we haven't seen it before. If Bill Wilson had been a young friend
of mine back in the sixties, I probably would have said to him,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Bill, you've gone and gotten all hung up in a crazy messianic
complex. Why don't you take another hit of that Purple Dome, and
this time, come down normal?&quot;
</font>

<p>
I didn't say that it would be good advice, I just said
that that's probably what I would have said.
And Bill Wilson did try LSD back in the
fifties, to see if it was any good for treating alcoholism.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#loved_LSD" target="_blank">Apparently, he liked it.
Actually, he loved it</a>.
He even shared it
with his wife, Lois, and said that she benefited from it.
Then he shared it with his secretary Nell Wing, and his
priest Father Dowling, and his minister Rev. Sam Shoemaker Jr.,
and then with every A.A. member and other alcoholic he could talk into taking it...
That went on for two years. Bill Wilson was doing a Timothy Leary routine before
Timothy Leary.
He only stopped doing it because some of the high-ranking people on the
Alcoholics Anonymous General Service Board started grumbling about Bill creating
yet another scandal by promoting drugs. But that's another story.

<p>
The biggest mistake Bill W. made is precisely what Ram Dass was
talking about: refusing to die, refusing to give up his ego.
&quot;Going in on the first round with your ego on.&quot;
Bill fought to live:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>&quot;He wanted to live.
He would do anything, anything, to be allowed to go on living.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill didn't understand that he was supposed to let go and die.
He fought to hold onto his ego and his life as if it were everything.
As if it were a matter of life and death, which it <i>usually</i> is,
when you start to feel like you are going to die.
That is to be expected. Unfortunately, Bill never had any
kind of spiritual training,
or a teacher to prepare him for a psychedelic experience.
He was born in the wrong decade for such
knowledge to be common, or &quot;in the air.&quot;
His spiritual experience happened in the nineteen-thirties,
and the psychedelic revolution
didn't happen until the nineteen-sixties.
Bill's preparation for his visionary experience was nothing but
years of guzzling cheap rotgut whiskey and bathtub gin.
And that is terrible preparation.
So what happened was pretty inevitable: Bill clung to his ego, and
fought off ego loss, and ended up becoming a bombastic wet-brain,<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>&quot;So this is <i>The God of the Preachers</i>!<br>
And there is Bill Wilson, hanging out with God...<br>
We feel we are walking on the Broad Highway in the sky,
hand-in-hand with the Spirit of the Universe...&quot;</b><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And there goes Bill Wilson, on a life-long ego trip,
with a big fat messianic complex, bound hand and foot, and
<a href="#outerdark" target="_blank">cast into outer darkness</a>...

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

As if things weren't complicated enough already, another
critic pointed out a very funny complication in Bill's story
about his religious experience. Bill claimed that this happened
to him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, God,&quot; he cried, and it was the sound not of a man,
but of a trapped and crippled animal. &quot;If there is a
God, show me. Show me. Give me some sign.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As he formed the words, in that very instant he was aware first
of a light, a great white light that filled the room, then he
suddenly seemed caught up in a kind of joy, an ecstasy such
as he would never find words to describe.
It was as though he were standing high on a mountaintop and a
strong clear wind blew against him, around him, through him
&#8212; but it seemed a wind not of air, but of spirit &#8212; and as
this happened he had the feeling that he was stepping into
another world, a new world of consciousness, and everywhere
now there was a wondrous feeling of Presence which all his
life he had been seeking.<br></font>
<font size="-1">&#8212; Robert Thomsen, <i>Bill W.</i>, 1975, pp. 222-223.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Hartigan2"> </a>
But in the biography of Bill that was written by Lois Wilson's personal
secretary, Francis Hartigan, we learn that Bill's paternal grandfather, who
was also named William Wilson, also had a bad drinking problem.
In desperation, he climbed a mountain one Sunday morning and had a religious experience
of a wind of Spirit blowing through him, and he never drank again:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
William Wilson may have preferred inn keeping to quarrying, but
inn keeping is seldom the right occupation for a hard-drinking man.
His attempts to control his drinking led him to try Temperance
pledges and the services of revival-tent preachers. Then, in a
desperate state one Sunday morning, he climbed to the top of
Mount Aeolus. There, after beseeching God to help him, he saw
a blinding light and felt the wind of the Spirit. It was a conversion
experience that left him feeling so transformed that he practically
ran down the mountain and into town.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he reached the East Dorset Congregation Church, which is across
the street from the Wilson House, the Sunday service was in progress.
Bill's grandfather stormed into the church and demanded that the
minister get down from the pulpit. Then, taking his place, he
proceeded to relate his experience to the shocked congregation.
Wilson's grandfather never drank again. He was to live another
eight years, sober.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.; A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous
Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan, page 11.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

What are the odds that both Bill's grandfather and Bill would
have exactly the same dramatic religious experience,
almost word-for-word identical,
<ul>
<li> both beseeching God for help,
<li> both seeing a blinding White Light,
<li> both feeling that they were on a mountaintop
with a wind of Spirit blowing through them,
<li> and both being so overwhelmed by the experience that they never
drank again?
</ul>
<p>
Or did Bill Wilson just appropriate his grandfather's story to
embellish his own detox experience?
<br>
Did Bill Wilson just exaggerate his drug experience to get more
&quot;spiritual credentials&quot; to be the leader of a cult religion?
<br>
Did Bill's grand vision of God really happen at all?

<p>
We are still left wondering just what this statement in the
Hazelden &quot;autobiography&quot; of Bill Wilson really means:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There will be future historical revelations about Bill's character
and behavior in recovery that will be interpreted, by some,
as direct attacks on the very foundation of AA.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W., My First 40 Years</i>, William G. Wilson,
Hazelden, page 170.</font></blockquote>
<p>
Remember, that &quot;autobiography&quot; was written by Hazelden staff
members, using
<a href="#tape_recordings" target="_blank">a set of autobiographical tape recordings</a>
that Bill Wilson made before
his death. So just what are they hiding in the sealed AAWS archives?
What else is on those tapes?
I am eager to hear those &quot;future historical revelations&quot;.

<b>&quot;Damn Your Old Meetings!&quot;</b><br>
That is the title of chapter 8 of Lois Wilson's book, <i>Lois Remembers</i>.
Lois' book is also pretty pathetic:
it was probably ghost-written for her, somebody else putting words into
her mouth, yet again, because it came out
in 1979, long after Bill's death, when she was also very
old and frail. The <i>Lois Remembers</i> book parrots much of
the standard party line from the <i>Big Book</i>, including the
&quot;jealous of God and A.A.&quot; story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Slowly I recognized that because I had not been able
to &quot;cure&quot; Bill of his alcoholism, I
resented the fact that someone else had done so,
and I was jealous of his newfound friends...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
God, through the Oxford Group, had accomplished in a twinkling
what I had failed to do in seventeen years.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> &#8212; <i>Lois Remembers</i>, page 99.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
All I can say is: What pathetic, brain-damaged tripe. Any normal wife
would be overjoyed to see her husband cured of a deadly disease. But not
in the weird world of A.A. &#8212; not in the delusional mind of Bill Wilson.
There, the wives are all jealous of God and A.A. (and not simply furious
that he insists on going to A.A. meetings all of the time, and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">picking up pretty younger women for affairs</a>,
instead of getting a job).

<a href="#ftnt06_ret">6</a>) <b>Outer Darkness:</b><br>
When I first went back and reread the Baba Ram Dass quote above,
after many years of not having looked at it, I thought
that the phrase <i>&quot;you're bound hand and foot and thrown
into outer darkness&quot;</i> was a little too strong.
<p>
(Even if it is out of the Bible, the Parable of the Wedding Feast,
Matthew 22:1 to 22:14. And while we're at it, the phrase
<i>&quot;only when you have been born again do you enter the Kingdom
of Heaven&quot;</i> is another Biblical quote: John 3:5.)
<p>
<a name="depression"> </a>
Now, I don't think &quot;thrown into outer darkness&quot; is too strong
of a description of Bill's predicament.
Bill Wilson appears to have been trapped in outer
darkness from December 14, 1934, when he had his vision of God,
to the very end of his life. Everything he wrote was insane, and he
grew darker and more depressed, and more depressing to others, as he aged. 
Five years after he wrote the Twelve Steps, he went into a deep clinical
depression that lasted for 11 years.
He was so sick that all he could do was sit in his office and
hold his head in his hands all day long. Lots of days, he just
didn't even bother to get out of bed &#8212; he just laid in bed and
stared at the ceiling all day.
His ravings in his book <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, which
he wrote in the middle of that period of depression,
13 years after the <i>Big Book</i>,
are really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">some dark and hateful stuff.</a>
<p>
Then, Henrietta Seiberling said that Bill Wilson ended up
telling people that he was
<a href="#Henrietta" target="_blank">the reincarnation of Jesus Christ</a>.
<p>

Ken Ragge
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160902122626/http://www.morerevealed.com/" target="_blank">
blames Dr. Silkworth</a> and his experimental treatments
for alcoholism, like &quot;the belladonna treatment&quot;,
for making Bill Wilson's mental condition worse.
Maybe so... That's the mental illness
<a href="#hallucinogen_disorder" target="_blank">292.11 Hallucinogen Delusional
Disorder</a>.
<p>
(Do read Ragge's 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160902122626/http://www.morerevealed.com/" target="_blank">first
chapter</a> of his book <i>More Revealed</i>
that is free on the Internet.
It is very good, simply <i>must</i> reading.)

the changelings, the Founders, addicted their Jem-Hadar warriors
to a drug-like substance called &quot;Ketracel-white,&quot;
which only the Founders could supply,
which made the Jem-Hadar the most loyal slaves in the galaxy.
<p>
Bill Wilson would have us similarly dependent upon A.A. and God for our
sobriety: Either &quot;Work the Steps&quot; and
&quot;Seek and Do the Will of God&quot; every day,
or relapse and die drunk in a gutter.

1. The first &quot;100&quot; is a figment of Bill's imagination.
<p>
2. As is recounted in RHS and elsewhere, in 1938, Bill and Bob counted
noses and found there were 40 who had maintained substantial sobriety.
These were called the &quot;pioneers.&quot; None of them was an
Oxford Group activist, but all of them in the Akron/Cleveland area
were attending the &quot;Oxford Group&quot; meetings at the home of
T. Henry and Clarace Williams. They were also making surrenders at
the hospitals or during meetings. They were attending morning Quiet
Time with Anne Smith at Dr. Bob's home. They were visiting Akron City
Hospital to tell their stories to the newcomers. And they called
themselves (some of them) &quot;the alcoholic squad of the Oxford
Group.&quot; The story was entirely different in New York because
so few had maintained sobriety. Hank P. was the first, and eventually
drank. Fitz M. was the second, was a believer, and stayed sober the
rest of his life. Jim B. stayed drunk for five years until he read
the Bible and never drank again. Others attended Oxford Group meetings
at Calvary House, some of which were led by Sam Shoemaker. Now that
takes care of the &quot;pioneers&quot; who numbered 40.
<p>
3. At the time the writing of the Big Book was authorized by a split vote of
Akronites, there were 40. By the time Bill had completed the Big Book which
was published in the spring of 1939, the number was in the 70's. I have the
figure in one of my books, <i>Turning Point</i>, I believe; but I don't have time
to look it up. Some of the material can be found in my book <i>The Akron
Genesis of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>. By the Spring of 1939, Bill and Lois had
been (to use their words) &quot;kicked out&quot; of the Oxford Group, and 
that was in August of 1937.

There is, of course, much much more. And I hope you have 
covered some of it in my various titles.<br>

This is Bill Wilson's version of the history of Alcoholics Anonymous.

LCCN: 84-072766<br>
Dewey: 362.29/286/O92<br>
This is the official, council-approved version of the history
of Alcoholics Anonymous.  A lot of it is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context" target="_blank">lies and distortions</a>
and re-writing history, and Bill Wilson's
tall tales.
Strangely enough, there is also some very interesting stuff
in here, including chapter 16, which describes Bill's spook sessions
and s&eacute;ances, talking with the spirits of the dead, and communicating
with spirits through spirit rapping and the Ouija board. See pages 275
to 285.

<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i><br>
(written by William G. Wilson and Tom Powers, published as 'anonymous'.)<br>
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. New York, NY, 2000.<br>
ISBN 0-916856-06-2 (smaller hard cover edition, 2000)<br>
ISBN 0-916856-01-1 (larger hard cover edition, 1984)<br>
Dewey: 362.2928 T969 1965<br>
LC: 53-5454<br>
This is one of the most insane and vicious books around.
It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and hate content, is concerned.
It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's
explanation of his Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, but it
is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">something quite
dark and evil</a>, Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for
human nature masquerading as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">all of his own
weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Look at him.
Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>
This whole book is non-stop guilt induction.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
By the way, Bill Wilson said in a letter to Father Edward Dowling, S.J., that
he was getting &quot;good help&quot; in writing this book
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Boniface" target="_blank">from the spirits
&quot;over there&quot; in the spirit world</a> whom he contacted during s&eacute;ances.
Father Dowling answered that he feared that Bill might be messing with evil,
lying, spirits from the dark side. Who knows, maybe he was...

<i>Lois Remembers</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Lois Wilson<br>
Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc., 1991.<br>
ISBN 0-910034-23-0<br>
Lois' book is pretty pathetic:
it was probably ghost-written for her, somebody else putting
words into
her mouth, yet again, because it came out
in 1979, long after Bill's death, when she was also very
old and frail. The <i>Lois Remembers</i> book parrots much of
the standard party line in the <i>Big Book</i>, including the
ridiculous &quot;jealous of God and A.A.&quot; story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Slowly I recognized that because I had not been able
to &quot;cure&quot; Bill of his alcoholism, I
resented the fact that someone else had done so,
and I was jealous of his newfound friends...
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
God, through the Oxford Group, had accomplished in a twinkling
what I had failed to do in seventeen years.<br>

This is an interesting book, even if it is a complete whitewash and gloss-over.
Nell Wing was Bill Wilson's secretary for about 35 years, so it is understandable.
And we can see the obvious fingerprints of the other true believers, helping
Nell to tell the standard stories in exactly the same way as others have,
like Bill's conversations with the ghosts of Nantucket. (Page 56.)<br>

<i>Bill W.</i> Robert Thomsen<br>
Harper &amp; Rowe, New York, 1975.<br>
ISBN 0-06-014267-7<br>
Dewey: 362.29 W112t<br>
This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is very positively
slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author knew Mr. Wilson and worked
beside him for the last 12 years of Mr. Wilson's life, and this book was prepared
from the set of autobiographical tape recordings that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will tell you about some of Bill Wilson's warts,
his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his years-long
&quot;dry drunks&quot;...

Dewey: B W11r 2000<br>
This book was written by another stepper &#8212; the name 'Matthew Raphael' is a pen name &#8212;
and it generally praises Bill Wilson and recites the party line about most things,
but it also contains a bunch of surprises,
like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his and Bob's spook sessions &#8212; talking
to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping,
and channeling, LSD use, and publicity-hound megalomania.

Dewey: B W11h 2000<br>
Francis Hartigan was the secretary of and confidant to Bill Wilson's wife Lois.
This book is pretty much a white-wash and tells the whole story from Bill's point
of view. But it does contain a few surprises, like the chapter &quot;The Other Woman&quot;
which details Bill's love affair with Helen Wynn, and hints at all of his other affairs
where he cheated on Lois, both before and after sobriety, all of his married life.

Dewey: 362.29'18'0973&#8212;dc21 or 362.291809 WHI<br>
This book is a mixed product.
The beginning, the history of early alcoholism treatment is excellent. 
But then the chapters on Alcoholics Anonymous are just reprints of the 
standard A.A. PR handouts. The strongest criticism of A.A. that he can
muster is asking whether it will work as well for women and racial minoritites
as white men, without ever having established that it works on white men.
(That's the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank"><i>Assume The Major Premise</i></a>.)
In fact, he dodges the whole question of the effectiveness of A.A. treatment
by saying that A.A. isn't a treatment program, and A.A. doesn't
keep records (page 176).
Still, this book is required reading for the serious student
of alcoholism and its treatment.<br>

ISBN: 0-9613289-7-5<br>

And yet another great book from the See Sharp Press.
Fox covers:
<ol>
<li> Heavy Drinking: Its Historical Context
<li> Alcoholism: Definitions &amp; Opinions
<li> Polarization: Us vs. Them
<li> The Objective: Personal Autonomy
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Essence &amp; Functions
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Effectiveness
<li> The Forces &amp; Directions of Change
<li> The Independent Self-Help Programs
<li> Rational Recovery Systems Network
<li> Traditional Recovery Management
<li> Nontraditional Recovery Management
<li> Noninstitutional Recovery
<li> ...and more...
</ol>
One of the things I like best is how Fox stresses just
how damaging and dangerous it is for A.A. and N.A. to teach
addicts that they are powerless over alcohol or their addiction, and
have no choice in the matter. That is a ready-made rationalization
for a drunkard to have another drink, and for a doper to shoot up again.
And that is what the steppers do.
Fox also does a good job of criticizing the arrogant
<i>&quot;My way or the highway&quot;</i>
attitude of self-righteous A.A. and N.A. sponsors.

This book tells you how to cope with being married to an obnoxious narcissist.
The one thing I couldn't see was, &quot;Why bother?&quot; Nina Brown makes narcissists
sound so bad that you really don't want to be married to one. But if you are
some kind of long-suffering masochist who really wants to go through it all,
read this book.<br>

tolerate the least little bit of criticism, and who felt entitled to take the

Dewey: 330.973092&#8212;dc20<br>
LCCN: 95-19946<br>
A fascinating book. The author shows how our real rate of economic growth,
after correcting for inflation,
has been depressed and below average since 1973. From 1820 to 1973,
the USA enjoyed an economic growth rate of around 4% per year,
even after averaging in the great depressions, but the author believes that
those heady days are gone forever. The Wild West is gone,
the buffalo are gone, the free land, oil, and trees are gone,
and the possibility of great rapid growth is gone.<br>
