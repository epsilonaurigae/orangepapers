Subject:  	&quot;Don't quit one day at a time; quit forever, all at once.&quot;<br>

<p>
I love this, Orange.

<p>
I know I've written twice in the past day,
but honestly, I'm freaked out by the fact
that I'm being forced to go to A.A.

<p>
The irony is that I was a successful media
professional in Los Angeles who had a 14-year
addiction to methamphetamine. Losing my
fiancee to breast cancer 3 years ago
didn't help. And I proceeded to bottom out.
Thankfully, my parents in FLA offered me
a chance to regroup, which is what I've been
doing. And the moment I stepped on that
plane at LAX and left California just over a year
ago? I have not touched speed. Haven't even
thought about it. 14 years of addiction.  Done.

<p>
Unfortunately, I got a DUI on a rare night out
a few months ago. Now I'm on probation, up to my neck
in fines and penalties, and being forced to
attend A.A. meetings. And I hate to say this,
but none of the people I have met there
seem &quot;successful&quot; outside of them being sober.
You know? Maybe I'm being elitist, I don't know.
They may be inviting, kind, and welcoming,
but no one I wish to emulate outside of their
collective sobriety.

<p>
Anyway, I've been devouring everything on
your site for the past 24 hours and I just
wanted to let you know I appreciate it.

Hi again, Brian,
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties. Unfortunately, there isn't any
really easy way out of getting sentenced to 12-Step meetings. But you can
certainly try to substitute SMART or SOS or Lifering meetings for 12-Step meetings.
You should be able to. Legally, that was established in
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges">many Federal Circuit Courts</a>
because A.A. is a religion (and so is N.A.).
It is unConstitutional to sentence anyone to a religion, so you are entitled
to a secular choice. But of course there are lots of courts that have no
respect for your Constitutional rights.

Subject:  	AA Arcticle<br>

<p>
I have read your acticle &quot;<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="newwin70">Whats not good about AA</a>&quot; and you have done  a
great disservice to any one who reads it.
<p>
I have personally seen the lives it has saved and could pick apart your
ludicrous notions one by one. but I sure it would fall on deaf ears.
I am only sorry that this arcticle has probably coerced numerous people
from finding a program that could change their lives.

<p>
This arcticle has taken &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of the program, taken them out
of context, distorted them and then presented them as if it was
doing some actual service to the reader.--------SHAME ON YOU

<p>
Todd B.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Todd,
<p>
Well, you start off with the standard A.A. attack slogan,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are doing a great disservice to those seeking sobriety.&quot;
</font><br>
I cannot count how many A.A. members have parotted that line.
It's the standard A.A. excuse for why people should not tell the truth
about Alcoholics Anonymous, as if A.A. actually worked to save the
lives of alcoholics, which it doesn't, and as if telling the truth about
A.A. will somehow hurt alcoholics, which it doesn't.
<a href="orange-letters103.html#disservice" target="newwin76">Look here for more
repetitions of that A.A. &quot;disservice&quot; rap</a>.

<p>
And come to think of it, that line
<font color="black">
<i>&quot;You are doing a great disservice to those seeking sobriety&quot;</i></font>
is described in
<a href="orange-not_good.html#item11" target="newwin75">Item 11 on that
<i>&quot;Whats not good about AA?&quot;</i> web page</a>, isn't it?
So I guess I predicted your behavior in advance, didn't I?

<p>
Then you repeat the standard false assumption of success.
<font color="black">&quot;I have personally seen the lives it has saved.&quot;</font>
<br>
No, actually what you should say is,
<font color="black">
&quot;I've seen people quit drinking&quot;</font>.<br>

Yes, so have I. And they did it without
any A.A. or any 12 Steps, or any yammering about &quot;Higher Power&quot; and 
&quot;resentments&quot; and &quot;surrender&quot;.

<p>
There is zero evidence that A.A. actually saves lives or makes alcoholics
quit drinking. Every time A.A. has been tested to see if it really works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin74">it failed the test badly</a>.
And even a leader of A.A., a member of the Board of Trustees of A.A. World Services,
Inc., found that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin73">A.A. made more alcoholics die than get sober</a>.
He found the A.A. death rate to be &quot;appalling&quot;. No way of treating
alcoholism that he studied had a higher death rate.
<p>
The only thing that A.A. is really good at is self-promotion and taking undeserved credit for
other people's hard work to quit drinking and stay sober.

<p>
And no, I don't take things out of context. That's another standard A.A. attack line.
We've been through that before, many times.
<a href="orange-letters93.html#out_of_context" target="newwin72">Look here</a>.
Just quoting things is not taking things out of context.

<p>
Now, while you are talking about shame, the question for you is,
&quot;How can you, in good conscience, continue to promote Alcoholics Anonymous,
and recommend that quackery to sick people?&quot;
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
The linked article is about maintenance drunks among lawyers. In the thread
the topic, as it does, turns to alcohol consumption. Someone asks if they
may be an alcoholic. The AA true believers descend. I, and  others put a few
questions to them, aided immeasurably by your site. The God-boggling begins.
Bill Wilson speaks from the grave. Suddenly words don't mean what we think
they mean and, finally, of course, one of the AA faithful hopes I go out and
have a drink.

<p>
Good times.

<p>
Hi!

<p>
I read through your page which listed the techniques, which I like by
the way. So I thought I give something back.

<p>
Reading it, I discovered an error:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Nazi_either_or" target="newwin88">
This Nazi propaganda poster</a> from World War II used the Either/Or
technique along with a lot of Glittering Generalities. It says:

<p>
In the Red War,<br>
Mother [i.e., Motherhood] or [degenerate] Enjoyment?<br>
People or Machines?<br>
...<br>
Race [Purity] or Mixed children?<br>
----<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think you read &quot;Mutter oder Genuss&quot;<br>
It actually says &quot;Mutter oder Genossin&quot;<br>
-&gt; Genossin is the female form of Genosse which means comrade &#8212; what
the communists used to call each other

<p>
and

<p>
it says<br>
Rasse oder Mischling -&gt; Race or crossbreed

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Aha! Thank you Daniel. Now that makes sense. I was struggling with
&quot;genussen&quot;, thinking that the past tense was genossen, and
trying to understand the logic, wondering,
&quot;What is so terrible about enjoying something? Were they really that
Puritanical and opposed to fun and enjoyment?&quot;
<p>
Now it's clear. I'll fix that.

Subject:  	Hi Orange<br>

<p>
I was just reading your most current letters. My the AA folks do get extra
pissy  with your reasoned and rational point of view now don't they? I
guess their patience, tolerance, kindliness and love is reserved only for
those that agree with them.

<p>
It is quite amazing the sheer venom I see poured out in their  letters. I
guess debunking their entire way of living is  rather scary  for them. They
have lost the ability to judge and reason obviously because you  have done an
absolutely terrific job of referencing your material.

<p>
Keep up the good work Orange... and you know you could retire quite
comfortably if you published your work.... there is a HUGE market out there! Plus
you would throw the whole treatment(AA) industry on its head.

<p>
Renee
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Renee,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.
<p>
Yes, some of those A.A. members do become rather upset when they hear A.A. criticized.
Apparently that A.A. slogan about &quot;Let us love you until you can love yourself&quot; only
applies to alcoholics who don't criticize Alcoholics Anonymous or the 12 Steps,
or tell the truth about Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob.
Oh well.
<p>
It's nothing new. That behavior is as old as cults, which date back at least 2000 or 3000
years... (and probably a lot longer than that). I am reminded of what Marjorie
Harrison wrote about the Oxford Group cult, which was the precursor to Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#no_use" target="newwin22">
Marjorie Harrison described her experiences</a> as a newcomer to the
Oxford Group meetings this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...you are bound to fall under the spell of the most
disarming friendliness that you have ever encountered.

[<i>It's called
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_aggressive_recruiting" target="newwin23">love bombing</a>&quot;.</i>]
</font>
The friendliness continues as long as you are a hearer of the word
as interpreted by people anxious to add your soul's scalp to the
rest of their collection.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They will bear &#8212; for a little time &#8212; with some criticism. But
if you fail to acquiesce in conviction and that fairly quickly,
then you are no longer interesting, and in the end, you find
yourself exhorted from the platform to &quot;pack up your
criticisms with your luggage and GO &#8212; you are of no use.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Saints Run Mad; A Criticism of the &quot;Oxford&quot; Group Movement</i>,

</blockquote>
<p>
Nothing is new under the sun.

<p>
About publication, I thought that I already had published the stuff, on the web.
I think about paper, but it is so dead, and the links don't work, and updates are
impossible.  And it would be a ton of work to reformat everything for paper publication.
I'd have to <i>come out of retirement</i> to do it. &nbsp; :-)

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Hi Agent Orange!

<p>
Thank you for your thoughtful
<a href="orange-letters101.html#Gary_B" target="newwin17">response to my last e-mail</a>.

<p>
Hmmm... I quite liked the term &quot;embroidery&quot; used in one of the citations
that you gave as applied to describe how &quot;shares&quot; become over time.

<p>
I just liked that word (as it was applied in your citation) &#8212; &quot;embroidery&quot;.
I might just borrow that one myself quite soon.

<p>
<a name="naltrexone"> </a>
Anyway, on to my main purpose with this e-mail: what do you know of
Naltrexone treatment for alcohol addiction?  Do you know anybody who takes
this treatment?  Have you formed any sort of opinion at all &#8212; or is the
&quot;jury still out&quot; on the efficacy of this one?

<p>
Sorry to bombard you with this one, Orange.  It's just that I've only heard
about it as a real alternative recently and, since you live in America and I
live here in dear old Blighty (where it's not yet officially approved as
anything but an anti-opiate), I thought you or some of the readers of your
website who have been on it for such use might have an opinion.

<p>
I mean, sure, I've looked it up on Wikipedia (which indicates it does have
some positive results) and clicked on a few links &#8212; which seem to be
blatantly positively-biased anecdotal evidence/advertisements from treatment
centres....... however, I don't have your obvious grasp of statistics......
so what do you make of it all?

<p>
Orange, I'm a little bit concerned that if you publish this e-mail it will
act as invitation for the 12 step Borg to type in a load of rubbish to your
site about how things like actual medicine for alcohol addiction never work
and how it's either &quot;their way or the highway&quot;, blah, blah..... but as a
person who is really, really struggling with my addiction right now, I'm
actually interested in what science has to offer and what anyone out there
who's actually on this stuff has to say about it.

<p>
I mean, I hear good things about Champix which is used for a similar purpose
for Nicotine addiction (which costs far more lives than alcohol)... so I'm
sort of thinking to myself, &quot;Why not investigate Naltrexone&quot;?

<p>
Besides, with money being tight, that sounds much cheaper (and much more
worth a go) than the money I'd need for the radical lobotomy I'd need to
enable me to be convinced enough to go back to the 12 step religious
fascists.

<p>
I mean, seriously, it's like coming out of an extremely abusive, vicious
relationship which was just killing me  &#8212; but where it's been really,
really hard to give up because as some sort of compensation the sex was
absolutely FUCKING ORGASMICALLY MIND-BLOWING (oh yeah, I've enjoyed a hell
of a lot of my drinking &#8212; something which I don't apologise for saying)...
and then, leaving that relationship, trying to then &quot;move back in with my
family&quot; (A.A.)....which is, weeelllll......  in this case like moving in
with &#8212; let's face it &#8212; the frigging Phelps.

<p>
(yep, a bunch of hateful, mentally ill, religious nuts in other words)

<p>
It's just swapping one abusive relationship for another &#8212; except that where
A.A. wants to claim your soul straight away, at least the drink is kind and
patient enough to wait until you're dead.  Is it any wonder most people
prefer drinking themselves to death rather than A.A.'s dubious salvation?

<p>
[Also, for some reason, am I the only one who for some reason gets images of
Bela Lugosi ominously saying &quot;Enter of your own free will&quot; in front of his
castle whenever I hear the beginning of the Big Book yak about &quot;The only
requirement for A.A. membership.....&quot; being read out at the start of a
meeting(???)]

<p>
To get to the point (and I'm sorry that my analogies have been somewhat
laboured):  From my (admittedly) limited reading about Naltrexone what seems
to be quite interesting to me is that the &quot;climax&quot; from drinking (i.e. the
endorphin release) doesn't quite happen anymore.... people instead feel more
of a sense of &#8212; what's the word? -indifference (?) and are more likely to
put the drink down rather than carry on to oblivion....

<p>
As I said before, Orange, I'd love to hear your opinion (or, indeed, anyone
else's opinion on this).

<p>
Thank you for your great website.

<p>
GASH

<p>
P.S. do you still speak to Jay from blamedenial.co.uk at all?  Do you know
if he's doing okay? ...you know, that was quite a bad business with him
having to shut down his website.  What a hell of a shame &#8212; he's a nice lad.
I actually corresponded with him a couple of times.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Gash,
<p>
I must confess that I am far less educated about the various anti-alcoholism
drugs than I should be. I have been pretty much dismissing them as useless,
for the simple reason that, when alcoholics want to drink, they just stop taking
the drugs. I read about how Anabuse didn't really work because,
when the alcoholics wanted to drink alcohol, they
just stopped taking the Anabuse, and waited 2 days for it to clear from their systems,
and then they could drink all that they wanted.
So the Anabuse wasn't even much of an &quot;aid to willpower&quot;.
What was missing was the will to take the Anabuse.

<p>
I may be wrong, but I suspect that the same thing will happen with the other
anti-alcohol-abuse drugs.
<p>
And in the long run, what are the alcoholics supposed to do? Take that drug
for the rest of their lives?
<p>
It is a simplistic truism, but it's still totally true:
<p>
<center><b>
People who want to drink alcohol will drink it.<br>
People who don't want to drink alcohol won't drink it.
</b></center>

<p>
It seems to me that the more successful approach is to work on one's desires,
to reduce the desire to drink &#8212; to essentially straighten out one's own thinking.
<p>
For me, whenever
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin18">that stupid lizard brain</a> starts yammering about
how much fun it would be to just have a few &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It will be okay. We can handle a few after all of these years...
Just one fun party for old times' sake...&quot;</i>,
</font>
another voice screams,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;No! I don't want to ever go back to being that sick again.&quot;</font>
And I remember the bad times.

<p>
And that does it for me. That stops any more thoughts about the fun of drinking and smoking.
No anti-alcohol drugs are required.

<p>
Now I don't want the alcoholics to go through Hell so that they will have a lot
of bad memories to fall back on, but I suspect that most of them will go through
Hell anyway, and will have some bad memories to remember.

<p>
That's where I keep thinking that something like SMART can be a big help, where people
practice realistically looking at the pros and cons of drinking, and look 
at the suffering and the bad times, and don't try to forget it or gloss it over.
When you truthfully, realistically, recognize how much pain and suffering alcohol has
really caused you, that kind of puts the kabosh on the desire to drink more alcohol.

<p>
I haven't been in communication with Jimmy lately. I didn't know that he had shut
down the Blamedenial web site.  But, the last time that I checked,
his videos were still up on YouTube.
I did hear that Jimmy wanted to retire from the scene and go do something else with
his life. I understand that, and even recommend it occasionally. In the end, everybody
should go do something else with their lives.
Real recovery means that you do something besides just spend the rest of your life
in recovery.

<p>
Have a good day.

May 7, 2009, Thursday: Day 7, continued:<br>
<p>
After a while, the family with Carmen came back to the grassy field for more grazing.

The father is standing guard over his brood.<br>
Carmen is the 2nd gosling from the left, the one with the darkest back and that light stripe
across the top of her tail.
<br>
</center>
------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Here, the father is proudly standing guard over his children.
But at another moment, he was very suspicious. He knew that
something was going on.
The father was thinking, &quot;I know that my family is bigger than it
was yesterday.&quot;
<p>
Now Canada Geese cannot actually count their
children &#8212; arithmetic just isn't in their brain power &#8212; but they do have a feel
for &quot;how many&quot; or &quot;how much&quot;.
And the father felt like he had gained a kid or something.
<p>
So the father gave each of the youngsters a hard look and a close examination,
passing his head over each one in turn and giving it a suspicious stare.
Poor little Carmen was cowering and shaking with fear, she was so afraid that he
was going to bite her on the back and drive her out of the family. But he didn't bite her.
He didn't reject Carmen. She passed inspection.
He went on to the next gosling and gave it a hard look, and then the next one...
In the end, he didn't reject any of them. 
He just shook his head and gave up.
<p>
He might have been thinking, &quot;Darn! I'm pretty sure that my family
is bigger than it was yesterday, but I can't figure it out.
These mathematical puzzles are so hard to solve when you can't count or
do arithmetic.&quot;

<p>
I'm sure it helped Carmen that she so closely resembled one of the other kids in
the family. The father could look at Carmen and say, &quot;Yeh, I have a kid who looks
like that.&quot; What didn't occur to his little brain was the idea, &quot;Yeh, but now you
have <i>two</i> kids who look like that.&quot;
That's more of that darned mathematics again.
<p>
There was also another factor working in Carmen's favor: she is probably related
to the other goslings in the family she jumped into. The Waterfront Park flock has
been intermarrying for 20 or 30 years now, so almost everybody is related to everybody else
in some way or other. There is a good chance that Carmen jumped into a bunch of her own cousins
&#8212; I don't know how many times removed, but cousins nevertheless.
So she may well have some family resemblance to the other little goslings.
That helps her to pass for one of the kids too.
<p>
It's interesting to see how geese think, or don't think. The father was simply comparing still
pictures in his mind with what he saw in front of him. He completely overlooked behavior.
He just didn't see it.
Imagine a scene where four little babies are completely nonchalant and unfazed by the father
examining them closely, while another one is shaking in fear and cowering down and trembling
when the father looks at her.
Which one do you think just snuck into the family?
Which one is afraid of being found out?
But the father didn't notice that at all.
He was completely blind to behavior and only looked at appearances.
His brain doesn't have the pre-frontal cortex required to visualize possible behavior. He can't think,
&quot;Now how would I act if I was a little gosling who had just snuck into a family?&quot;
Nope. That just isn't in his brain power.
So he just compared still pictures in his mind with the goslings in front of him, and they
all looked like one of his kids.
So all that he could do was shake his head in frustration, and give it up.

<p>
A while later...
<p>

The geese are drinking from a puddle of rainwater.<br>
The father is drinking with the kids.<br>
When was the last time that your parents said to you, &quot;That's a good kid.
Now go play in the mud puddle...&quot;?
</center>
</font></font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
And this is the big one. This is life or death for a little gosling.
A few hours later, they were back down at the river. Carmen was cold and wet,
and begged the mother to let her get under the mother's wing and get warmed up.
The mother let her in.
The mother didn't reject Carmen; she accepted Carmen as one of her own children.
Actually, the mother didn't even look. She acted like she was just tired. When one
the babies chirped that it wanted to get under her wing and get warm, she just lifted
her wing and let it in without even looking to see who it was.
So Carmen got accepted by the mother.
That's pretty much everything. That's the whole ball game.
Without a mother to keep her warm at night, Carmen couldn't
survive out there &#8212; hypothermia would kill her.
But with a mother letting Carmen under her wing, Carmen could live
outdoors.
<p>
Carmen was the first gosling to feel cold, probably because she had been in
my warm apartment during the cold rain storms of the previous week, while the other
goslings were out in it. So they were more aclimated to the cool weather than
she was. But she had the advantage of being well-fed. She had spent a week stuffing
herself with all of the food that she could possibly eat, and she had a small reserve of fat
to carry her through the transition.
<p>
Carmen then climbed up the side of the mother's body, under her wing, so
that she could sit under Mama's wing with her head poking out, safe and warm in bed
while watching what was going on around her.
Goslings like to do that. (So do ducklings.)

Carmen under her new mother's wing<br>
</center>

<p>
Here, Carmen is determined to stay right where she is, even though the mother has gotten
up on her feet and is walking around. Carmen has been so hungry for a real goose mother's
attentions that she refuses to give it up now. She won't budge.

Carmen is staying under her new mother's wing, even when the mother gets up and

What you can't see in these photos is that I was feeding them some bread that I had.
Now the mother would like some more.
</center>
</font></font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
When I saw this, I figured that the adoption was pretty much a done deal.
And it was.  I couldn't have gotten Carmen back even if I wanted to.
And Carmen didn't want to come back to me.
Carmen liked me and we got along just fine and everything, but she really
wanted a goose mother. She wanted a normal gosling childhood &#8212; the gosling version of a
Dick-and-Jane world &#8212; with a real goose mother and a bunch of gosling
brothers and sisters, and a gander father.
And in the end, that's what she got.
(Even if she had to fib a little to get it.)

Carmen is still staying under her new mother's wing.<br>
</center>
<p>
I followed Carmen around for a few hours more, to make sure that everything was okay,
and it was. She was just another one of the kids in the family by then.
<p>
When it was getting late, and cold and dark, and the geese were still grazing,
there was nothing left to do but let go of her and go home, and believe that everything
would work out for the best.
<p>
And when I got home, I had a massive attack of empty nest syndrome, of course.
So it goes.

From:  	&quot;Dan L.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	thank you so much for exposing AA<br>

<p>
Hi:
I am a second offense drunk driver from Michigan. I suffered emotional abuse
from my guardians my whole life. for 2 brief periods in my adult life I
found myself forced to ask for their help and allow me to live with them. Of
course getting sadistic pleasure from showing me how much they hate me they
allowed it but conditionally. I would often turn to alcohol as an escape
from their abuse and humiliation. Both times I got a drunk driving ticket.
<p>
Michigan has a very regressive law for 2nd offenders and they force you to
prove that you will never drink again if you want a license back. The only
way to prove that is to go to AA.
<p>
I tried for a year going to meetings every
day. at first I thought I had to accept this as my new life. but AA was like
a torture. people who knew nothing about me were constantly giving me
advice. I felt I had no choice but to take it. after a little time I
realized that these people were just like my guardians.
<p>
Now I am not saying
that AA is bad for everyone or that it was not in some ways a good
experience for me. however there is a cult aspect and I have a really
difficult time when I see some people coming in and out of meetings almost
bragging about how outta control they are.
<p>
Overall I think that AA has made
my drinking worse but I have long since stopped going to meetings and I am
doing much better. unfortunately I am finding myself tempted to go back to
aa to try to prove that I am worthy of a license. AA is simply replacing one
obsessive compulsive behavior with another.  AA can be just as addictive as
alcohol and just as damaging to ones life.
<p>
Why then does michigan believe it
is the only way for people that have been pulled over while 'legally drunk'
the ONLY recourse?

<p>
I will be doing more research on your site.

<p>
Thanks,
Dan

Hello Dan,
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. The reason that the State of Michigan thinks
that A.A. is &quot;the only way&quot; or that A.A. has a successful program is probably because
a hidden member of A.A. wrote the rules.  That is usually the case.
Either that, or hidden members of A.A. were &quot;advisors&quot; to the person who wrote the
rules.
<p>
Of course, the assumption that A.A. works is never based on an accurate measurement
of the real A.A. success rate. The valid controlled tests show that A.A. is a total failure that
just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin22">increases the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin23">increases the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>.
The assumption that going to A.A. proves that someone will never drink alcohol again
is absurd and totally disconnected from reality.
<p>
We were just discussing the whole issue of DUI and alternatives to A.A. &quot;treatment&quot;
a few letters ago,
so I'll point you to it <a href="orange-letters116.html#dui_alt" target="newwin24">here</a>, rather
than repeat it all again.
<p>
If you can get no satisfaction from the State, I'd consider going to the ACLU.
The State of Michigan has no right or privilege to mandate a cult religion as the
only &quot;treatment for alcoholism&quot;, or the only way to get your driver's license
back.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
jus bin reading this, quite disturbing, lot of it makes sense but other part say to
me that the writer may hold resentment and may not even be christian or know
anything about addiction due to it not being backed by scripture or any refference
to his own experience gb jxx

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jason,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Well, right at the start, I see that big red-flag word &quot;RESENTMENT&quot;.
The true-believer Steppers are always talking about resentments and
claiming that you cannot have one or else you will get drunk again, or
you will be spiritually defective.  Bill Wilson even wrote:

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about
&quot;justifiable&quot; anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't
we entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly angry with self-righteous
folk? For us in A.A. these are dangerous exceptions.
We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those
better qualified to handle it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, guess what? Bill Wilson was wrong. It is not a &quot;spiritual axiom&quot;
that you are wrong if you &quot;have a resentment&quot;. It isn't even
true at all. That was one of Bill Wilson's crazier declarations.
<p>
By Bill Wilson's brain-damaged logic,
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would
have been wrong to resent the bad treatment of blacks.
And Abraham Lincoln would have been wrong to have resented the treatment of blacks in
slavery.
And the Women's Suffragettes would have been wrong to resent being denied the vote
and other equal civil rights.
And the Allies in World War II would have been wrong to have resented
Hitler's treatment of the Jews in the concentration camps.
The Americans would have also been spiritually wrong to have resented the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor.

<p>
By Bill Wilson's ravings, even Jesus Christ would have been spiritually wrong
for getting angry and whipping the thieving money changers from the Temple,
and for criticizing the Hypocrites and
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, and the
corrupt Temple leaders.

<p>
Bill Wilson's warped theology is most assuredly not Christian or compatible with Christianity.
You should read the file
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.

<p>
<a name="experiences"> </a>
As far as my own experiences go, you are just attempting another
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="newwin12"><i>Ad Hominem</i></a>
attack on a critic.  My personal experiences actually have little or nothing to
do with whether A.A. is a fraud that hurts more alcoholics than it saves.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="newwin09">The facts speak for themselves</a>.
A.A. would still be just as much of a fraud even if I had never been born.

<p>

Subject:  	Tobacco Free!<br>

<p>
Hey Orange:

<p>
I wanted to &quot;share with you&quot; (LOL) that I quit smoking... as of this writing,
it's day 24 of being tobacco free.

<p>
I was reading through your recently posted letters and you described your
use of the patch... whatever works, but what worked for me was cold-turkey.

<p>
I read a book recently that touched on quitting addictions, smoking and
drinking being the outstanding examples.  This was not a book about quitting
addictions specifically, it was about the lies we tell ourselves that hold
us back.

<p>
Anyway, much of it is how we perceive ourselves.  I realized that if I
perceived myself as a smoker that is trying to quit, the cravings would be
unbearable.  However, if I perceived myself as a non-smoker, that no longer
stinks and is working toward getting healthy, well, it's a lot easier!

<p>
I still have cravings, but this technique really helps shut up the ol'
Lizard Brain!

<p>
Makes me wonder why someone that hasn't drank alcohol in 1, 3, 5 or 20 years
would sit in a room and call themselves an alcoholic!  Maybe it's time
to... I don't know... get a life?

<p>
Keep up the good work.

<p>

Hi again, Dennis,
<p>
Congratulations. By now, I guess you have 2 months off of tobacco. Good.
That's big, really big. Your life will improve so much. The quality of life
difference for me is almost unbelievable.

<p>
You make some good points in your letter. Sitting around thinking,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am a cigarette addict who is being deprived of a cigarette&quot;
</font>
is bound to
plant a suggestion in your mind that you should be crawling the walls for a cigarette.
<p>
On the other hand, thinking
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am a non-smoker who is free, and I don't need a cigarette to be happy&quot;
</font>
has the opposite effect.
<p>
Funny how the mind works.
<p>
Stephen Gaskin said that the two most important words in the English language
are &quot;I am.&quot; And he said that you must be very, very careful what you put after those
two words, because you are defining yourself, and making yourself into something.

<p>
And yes, sitting around declaring, &quot;I am an alcoholic&quot; can have some bad effects
on someone's mind after a few years, especially if he isn't very careful about the 
definition of an &quot;alcoholic&quot;. We discussed the various definitions of the word
&quot;alcoholic&quot; before,
<a href="orange-letters90.html#alcoholic_defs" target="newwin07">here</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately, A.A. mixes up the definitions, so when someone says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am an alcoholic,&quot;
</font>
than can mean anything from<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I used to drink too much alcohol many years ago&quot;<br>
</font>
to<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I am an immoral unspiritual criminal who will tell any lie to get another drink.&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
Oh by the way, I've also quit cigarettes cold turkey, many times. I just used the
patch the last time, and it made it a lot easier. I agree, whatever works.

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
Interesting stuff you have there regarding AA. All I can say form my seat is
I have been in the program I guess you could say since 1990. I have had a
relapse after years of not going to any meetings and started going again in
2005. It works for me and I do find spirituality in my life by &quot;practicing
these principles in all my affairs&quot; I most certainly am not perfect and try
and &quot;take one day at a time&quot; but one of things you seem to miss as do
others, is that it is a program that is suggested not mandated.
<p>
The only
reason I go is for me and I enjoy the group and the friends I have made in
the program. I will also grant you that there is not one right way to do
anything. And you bring up one very interesting point which is that people
can stop drinking by themselves If they truly want to Kind of like the
classic &quot;I'll do anything to lose weight except eat less and exercise.&quot; It
all starts with the individual. One can do anything they put their mind too.
All too few people do that. And you are right, successful people do that.
<p>
For those that complain about how some people act. Find a different meeting,
or don't go at all. That is the beauty of it. I enjoy the meetings and my
association with the program. I feel it helps me and I have grown from it.
<p>
Cheers,

<p>
Jules

Hello Jules,
<p>
Congratulations on quitting drinking again. There is, however, no evidence
that you started drinking again because you were not going to A.A. meetings,
or that you quit drinking again becuase you went to some more meetings.
That is just <a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="newwin13">Confusing Correlation and Causation</a>.
The truth is,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">
the vast majority of people who go to A.A. meetings don't quit drinking</a>,
and the vast majority of people who do quit drinking don't go to A.A. meetings.

<p>
The claim that the program is &quot;just suggested, not mandated&quot; is just some
more A.A. double-talk &#8212; just another standard
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="newwin04">bait-and-switch trick</a>.
&quot;The Program&quot; is most assuredly mandated when someone has to get
a &quot;progress&quot; statement signed by a sponsor to please a parole officer or treatment center
&quot;counselor&quot;.
Failure to please a sponsor can have very serious legal repercussions.

<p>
And Bill Wilson repeatedly declared that the 12-Step program was mandated:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested
<font color="#9F0000">[MY required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to <font color="#9F0000">[MY]</font> spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To one who feels he is an
atheist or agnostic such an experience seems impossible, but to
continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an
alcoholic of the hopeless variety. To be doomed to an alcoholic
death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy
alternatives to face.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, page 44.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(That is, of course, the common cult characteristic of
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias">The Cult Implants Phobias</a> &#8212; 
&quot;You will die if you leave our cult.&quot;)
</font>

<p>
The statement on page 59, the second page of chapter 5 of the <i>Big Book</i>,
 that says that the 12-Step program
is &quot;suggested as a program of recovery&quot;
<a href="orange-letters120.html#suggested" target="newwin08">was just a sop</a>
that Bill Wilson threw to
<a href="orange-religious_faith#spiritual_tolerant" target="newwin09">Jim Burwell,
the resident atheist</a>,
who complained that such dogmatic religiousity would drive alcoholics away.
But Bill immediately contradicted that statement in the start of the
next chapter that he wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 72 = the first page of chapter 6.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rest of it, how good the meetings make you feel, is just fluff.
That doesn't compensate for the alcoholics who die because they were given grossly
wrong information about alcoholism and recovery, like that they are powerless over
alcohol.
As a program of recovery from alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction, A.A. has fatal flaws:
<a name="tested"> </a>
<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>A.A. raises the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics.</b><br>
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma tested A.A., and found that it immensely increased
the rate of binge drinking. The A.A. members were doing FIVE TIMES as much
binge drinking as the &quot;unhelped&quot; alcoholics, and NINE TIMES as much bingeing
as another group of alcoholics who got some Rational Emotive Therapy.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin07">Look here</a>.
<p>
<li>
<b>A.A. raises the arrest rate of alcoholics.</b><br>
Dr. Keith Ditman found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness in court-mandated offenders</a>.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin03">Look here</a>.

<p>
<li>
<b>A.A. increases cost of hospitalizing alcoholics.</b><br>
Dr. Dianna C. Walsh found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin01">Look here</a>.

<p>
<li> <b>A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics.</b><br>
Alcoholics Anonymous Trustee Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant tried to prove
that A.A. works, and instead accidentally proved that A.A. kills.
No program for treating alcoholism had a higher death rate than did A.A.-based treatment.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="newwin06">Look here</a>.

<p>
<li>
<b>A.A. is ineffective.</b><br>
In London, Doctors Orford and Edwards found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="newwin02">Look here</a>.

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	How many sentenced to AA<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
Do you have a source for how many people are sentenced to AA each year?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Scott,
<p>
No, that's one number I don't have. The would be good to find.

</font>
<p>
I've discovered a trend that shows AA is shrinking. New membership is down by half.
If you look at the AAGSO worldwide membership estimates, it goes like this:

<p>
2006 estimate (worldwide)<br>
1,867,212 members (increase of 122,048<br>
106,202 AA groups<br>

<p>
2007 estimate (worldwide)<br>
1,989,260 members(increase of 122,000 or 6.5%)<br>
Total Groups: 114,561 (increase of 8359 groups)<br>

<p>
2008 estimate (worldwide)<br>
2044,655 members (increase of 55,395)<br>
113,168 groups (decrease of 1,393 groups)<br>

<p>
and a growth of
about .48 new members per group per year.

<p>
Groups decreasing and new
membership waning by half.

<p>
I read somewhere that it is estimated that 1 million people are sentenced to AA
annually, but the number was not backed up by a source so I will not pass this
information along until I have a credible source. Do you know where to get this
information?

<p>
Thanks!

<p>
Scott

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, just offhand I don't know where we could get that information.
Readers, any ideas?
<p>
I can believe that A.A. attendance is shrinking. Sooner or later, people do wake up
and realize that something is a hoax. You can't fool all of the people all
of the time. Sometimes it takes a long time for people to realize what is going on
and wise up, but eventually we get rid of the quacks and the quackery, and the
phony preachers and fake faith-healers...

<p>
Have a good day.
