Subject:  	AA Nonsense<br>
Date:  	Mon, June 4, 2012 7:55 pm &nbsp; &nbsp; (answered 7 June 2012)<br>

<p>
I have been sober for 14 months (meth). I am living in transitional housing where
is I am required to attend 3 meeting per week. At first I was excited about AA, but
as I saw the whole process and hearing the same thing at every meeting from people
that been there 25 years drives me crazy. The people that run the transitional
house are true AA steppers. They tell me that I am in denial of being a addict and
the only way to stay sober is to work the 12 steps, attend meeting, and fellowship.
I get so annoy with there AA and Big Book talk. What can be a valid response to
them that I will not relaspe, just because I am not excited about NA/AA/CA. They
say I will relapse because I not working the program. I am done with drugs and got
tired of that lifesyle, ready to live life sober without AA. They said AA leads you
to God and must have a connection with God to stay sober. I know Jesus and believe
that he has deliver me from the bondage of addition.
<p>
Thanks for the site I thought
I was wrong for feeling the way I did about AA and the members. There are rarely
any newcomers, just the same people saying the same thing over and over again. I
refuse to think and say I have a disease, sick way of thinking, along with
characters defects for the rest of my life. These people are insane!

Hello Crystal,

Congratulations on your new clean and sober lifestyle. Fourteen months is over the hump.
The worst is over. And thanks for the letter, too.

About your halfway-house lunatics: Everything they told you is wrong. Everything. We can just go

No you aren't. You are seeing the truth. They are in denial. They refuse to see the truth,
they refuse to tell the truth, and the truth
is that they are mindlessly parrotting the lies of an old cult religion.

<p><li>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;They say I will relapse because I not working the program.&quot;
</font><p>
Bullshit. Totally untrue. Just for starters, I have 11 years clean and sober, and have not been to
a 12-Step meeting in over 10 years. I quit going to A.A. and N.A. meetings when I discovered that I could go to SMART
meetings instead, and would not have to listen to the crazy lies of some cult members.
<p>
And it isn't just me:
<ul>
<li> The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health says that 75% of the
successful quitters do it alone.
<li> The Harvard Medical School says that 80% of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year or more do it alone,
on their own. And likewise, most drug addicts quit on their own.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">Look here for the rest of the story</a>.
</ul>

<p>
A.A. and N.A., on the other hand, have at least a 95% failure rate.
Sometimes, it's much worse than that. In some medical tests, A.A. produced a zero-percent improvement along with
an
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increased binge-drinking rate</a>
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">an elevated death rate</a>. (It's all in that file.)
<p>
And
<a href="orange-letters299.html#Ray_S" target="_blank">Narcotics Anonymous also failed similar tests</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;They said AA leads you to God and must have a connection with God to stay sober.&quot;
</font><p>
Baloney. A.A. and N.A. are a grossly-heretical religion, in direct conflict with Christianity in
many ways. Steppism leads to something more like Satan-worship than Christianity.
There is a great deal of similarity between
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">selling your soul to Satan in trade for sobriety</a>,
and surrendering your mind, your will, and your conscience to the A.A. or N.A. &quot;higher power&quot;

new members for the cult.

<p>
I wrote a whole file about that:

</font><p>
Happily, that is one line that I don't have to refute. I believe you. When you are done with it, you
are done with it.
Sooner or later, everybody either gets done with it, or gets dead. I'm glad that you chose life.

<p>
Lastly,
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Thank you for the thoughtout response. It is nice to have intelligent conversation

you'd respond, but I appreciate your time and will add a couple more things. The
applicable snippets of your response (and info from your website) will be in

Hello again, Anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Alas, none of the colors or formatting came through the email, so I'll have to
reformat it and colorize it myself.

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">



 &quot;Right. The first confusion is in just what constitutes
'help' or 'saving'.&quot; True. I suppose that if whatever &quot;helps&quot; an alcoholic stop
drinking, it might just be &quot;saving&quot; his/her life. Although, of course there are a
lot of other factors involved. &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is good at claiming undue
credit.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
 How is Alcoholics Anonymous claiming undue credit? From what I understand
(and correct me if I'm wrong), you've had a hard time tracking down official numbers
from Alcoholics Anonymous. Penn and Teller also ran into the same problem in their
Bullshit episode about A.A. That doesn't seem like claiming credit at all. It would
be great to see official and recent claims Alcoholics Anonymous as an organization
has made. If Penn and Teller couldn't find any official ones, I'd be interested to
see in just what numbers people are using to blame A.A. for taking credit, and where
those numbers are coming from.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">a false dichotomy</a>.
Alcoholics Anonymous is not just a corporation in New York City that issues or fails to issue numbers.

That is the old &quot;Real A.A.&quot; argument. Whenever A.A. members do something
bad, the A.A. proselytizers start complaining and rationalizing that
they aren't &quot;the real A.A.&quot;  &#8212;  the &quot;real A.A.&quot; is something else:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
First, the real A.A. is what Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob created. They are considered
the Saints of A.A., and their teachings are allegedly <i>The Message From God</i>.
A.A. members reverently read <i>As Bill Sees It</i> out loud at meetings.
<p><li>
But then, when you point out
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">what sick insane men Bill Wilson
and Dr. Bob really were</a>,
the A.A. promoters claim that the A.A. program is the 12 Steps and the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out what insane Buchmanite nonsense is in <i>the Book</i>,
and how
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
the 12 Steps are really just the cult practices of Dr. Frank Buchman</a>,
then the &quot;real A.A.&quot; is <i>The Fellowship</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out how many
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">con artists, psychopaths</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">rapists</a>
make up the Fellowship, they claim that the real A.A. is the
corporation whose headquarters is in the Interchurch Center in New York City.

<p><li> Then, when you point out
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">what crimes that corporation has been committing lately</a>,
the A.A. true believers insist that the real A.A. is the teachings of Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob.
</ul>
<p>
Baloney. It's all really A.A.
<p>
Now there are plenty of A.A. members who teach that A.A. is <i>the only way</i>, and you will die unless
you &quot;Work A Strong Program&quot;. Heck,
<a href="orange-letters310.html#Crystal_C" target="_blank">the previous letter that I just got</a> complained about just that.

<p>
And A.A. routinely makes grandiose claims of great success rates in treating alcoholics. Bill Wilson lied in
the <i>Big Book</i>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.
Other thousands came to a few A.A. meetings and at first decided
they didn't want the program. But great numbers of these &#8212; about
two out of three &#8212; began to return as time passed.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


</font>
<p>


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

 &quot;There
are plenty of people who are going to quit drinking, because they have just had
it with being so sick all of the time, and having alcohol mess up their lives.
Those are the cases of normal spontaneous remission.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

 Right, but how many of those
were alcoholics? I think this is where effectiveness of any program starts to blur.
Just because a person is in an A.A. meeting, does not mean they are an alcoholic. I
think that differentiation needs to be made.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">another false dichotomy</a>.
When you don't like the results of the tests, you start quibbling about
whether they were &quot;real alcoholics&quot;. But further down in this letter, you are assuming that they are
&quot;real alcoholics&quot; who are fooling the doctors.
<p>
If somebody is such a bad drinker that he ends up in the hospital for detoxing, then it's a fair bet
that he has a serious drinking problem. Whether he is &quot;a real alcoholic&quot; seems to depend on
hair-splitting definitions.
</font>
<p>


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

 &quot;Whenever one of those
people walks into an A.A. meeting, A.A. is quick to claim that it saved them, or
&quot;helped&quot; them. And A.A. wants to count them as its success rate. But A.A. is not
due the credit for those people, even though they may have attended A.A.
meetings while they quit drinking.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>



 Again, I don't see where A.A. is taking any
credit. I do see them making claims in the Big Book, starting when it was written
back in the late 1930s. I think there are also some numbers in some of the forwards,
but some of those are just membership numbers, and not directly related to how many
it has &quot;saved&quot; or &quot;helped&quot; or whatever.


<p>
<font color="blue">
That is <a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a>.
The <i>Big Book</i> very specifically made grandiose claims of great cure rates, and now you try to
claim that the numbers only apply to &quot;members&quot;? That is not what Bill Wilson wrote.
And that is not what A.A. members claim today.
Bill Wilson even claimed that non-members &quot;began to return&quot;.
</font>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

 &quot;I suppose I should modify that sentence to
read, &quot;A.A. kills one patient for each one that it appears to save. Killing as many
patients as it appears to help means that A.A. does not work.
Look at penicillin, for example. It is deadly poisonous to some patients, and
kills them. But doctors are careful about whom they give penicillin to, and I
think it's fair to say that penicillin saves at least 1000 or 10,000 patients
for every one that it kills. Now that is a medicine that works. Something that
kills as many patients as it appears to help is useless, or even worse than
useless. It's really a very poisonous medicine.
<p>
Now your question about &quot;how could A.A. really kill people?&quot; Simple:

<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Have crazy sponsors who tell the newcomers not to take their
doctor-prescribed medications. The newcomers then die from heart attacks,
strokes, psychotic breaks and suicides, and on and on.

<p><li> Also drive newcomers into bad
depression by the constant harping on lists of
sins and moral shortcomings, and constant confession sessions, which also drives
people to suicide.

<p>
<li>
Then there is the teaching that alcoholics are powerless over alcohol. That leads to
worse
binge drinking, and deaths.

<p>
<li>
Then there is the induced hopelessness, which leads people to believe that
they cannot ever recover. That leads to more suicides and uncontrolled drinking.

<p>
Bill Wilson even taught A.A. recruiters to make people feel hopeless in order
to mess with their minds:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Maybe
you have disturbed him about the question of alcoholism. This is all to the
good. The more hopeless he feels, the better. He will be more likely to follow
your suggestions.

</font>
<font size="-1">

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is vicious.

<p>
<li>
And then there is the general obnoxiousness of Alcoholics Anonymous driving
people away from any kind of treatment or help. Lots of people decide that they
would rather drink themselves to death than turn into an A.A. religious nutcase.&quot;

</ol>

</font>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<p><li>

1.
It specifically says in the Big Book that it is not intended for medical advice. And
those &quot;crazy sponsors&quot; are not supposed to be giving medical advice to newcomers.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231339/http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/f-2_InfoonAA1.pdf" target="_blank">
http://www.aa.org/pdf/products/f-2_InfoonAA1.pdf</a><br>

 You cannot pin those deaths on the
organization when those actions are carried out by certain individuals (the
sponsor). That would be like saying the entire medical profession kills people
because some doctors prescribe mediciation in dangerous and inappropriate ways.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I can pin those deaths on Alcoholics Anonymous. It's all A.A.: the meetings, the untrue dogma
and propaganda, the cult religion, and the bad sponsors who tell people not to take their medications.
It's all &quot;the real A.A.&quot;. Again, you are trying to use false dichotomies,
by splitting A.A. into many pieces, and assigning the blame to only some pieces.


<p>
Furthermore, the whole argument about whether A.A. is a medical authority on alcoholism is a bait-and-switch
trick:<br>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#doctors" target="_blank">First, they will tell you to see a doctor, and say
that &quot;we know only a little&quot;, but then it's &quot;We know more than doctors&quot;,
&quot;We are the experts on addictions&quot;, and &quot;Don't take medications.&quot;</a>

</font>
<p>
<li>
 2.
About newcomers being driven into bad depression, we cannot abandon personal
responsibility, or blame Alcoholics Anonymous because of a blurry correlation. I
would be willing to bet most newcomers could be classified as depressed, whether it
be acute or long lasting. You would need some specific evidence linking newcomers
and A.A. being the cause of it (and even suicide, as you go on to claim). A.A. is
usually voluntary, and in the cases of &quot;mandatory&quot; meetings by the court, there are
MANY meetings out there. You're all for self-empowerment, and not being &quot;powerless&quot;.
If a newcomer is finding him/herself spiraling into a &quot;bad depression&quot; because of
A.A., they need to take some personal responsibility and try different meetings.
<p>

<font color="blue">
The A.A. death rate is not &quot;a blurry correlation&quot;. Again, you are in denial.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.hmtl#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. Vaillant, who went on to become a member of the Board of Trustees of A.A., spend nearly 20 years
treating alcoholics with A.A.</a>, and the results were:

Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
...<br>
Once again, our results were no better than the natural history of the disorder.<br>

</blockquote>

</font>
<p>

Also, I am not sure where the &quot;constant harping on lists of sins and moral
shortcomings&quot; happens. In Step 4, you &quot;Made a searching a fearless moral inventory
of yourself&quot;. Introspection is not a bad thing. Resentment is an awful thing to
carry around for anybody (not just alcoholics). As one person wrote about it in one
of your letters (paraphrasing), &quot;AA bottles up and suppresses anger and resentment&quot;.
To me, getting those down on paper and dealing with them is just the opposite. In
fact, coincidentally, it runs parallel to what many counseling programs suggest you
do. Never in the steps does it say anything about &quot;sins&quot;. The &quot;constant&quot; confession
session only happens in Step 5. It isn't a &quot;constant&quot; thing, unless you count step
10, where you continue to take personal inventory and when you are wrong, promptly
admit it. Introspection (of both good and bad behavior) is not a bad thing.
Admitting you are wrong when you are wrong is not a bad thing. The other list, as
you know, is the list of people one has harmed, becoming willing to make amends to
those people, and then making amends to them. Once again, personal responsibility is
not a bad thing. And driving people to suicide? That is correlation, not causation.
To make the leap from correlation to causation is a fallacy, as you probably know.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh baloney.

<ul>
<p><li>
 In Step One, you admit that you are powerless and cannot manage your life.
<p><li>
In Step Two, you confess that you are insane.
<p><li>
In Step Three, you confess that you cannot run your own life.
<p><li>
In Step Four, you get serious about listing your every moral shortcoming and sin and wrong.
<p><li>
In Step Five, you read the whole list out loud, and confess it all to someone.
<p><li>
In Step Six, you confess that you have &quot;defects of character&quot;.
<p><li>
In Step Seven, you yammer about your &quot;shortcomings&quot;.

<p><li>
In Step Eight, you dwell on everybody whom you ever harmed.
<p><li>
In Step Nine, you go and humbly grovel and apologize for everything.
<p><li>
In Step Ten, you promise to repeat that insane routine for the rest of your life.
</ul>

<p>
That's enough to depress anyone. It even drives some people to suicide, when they are told that they
cannot ever recover and be like normal people.

<p>
The bottom line is that the whole routine has never been shown to benefit anyone. Not spiritually or physically.
It just drives people to drink and death.

<p>
This line is correct, but deceptive:
<font color="black">
Never in the steps does it say anything about &quot;sins&quot;.</font><br>

Right. Bill Wilson saved the word &quot;sin&quot; for his second book, &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;.
Bill didn't want to get in trouble with the Catholic Church, which has a ban on public confessions of
sins, so Bill renamed &quot;sins&quot; to &quot;defects of character&quot;, and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, and &quot;wrongs&quot;.
Bill also renamed confession to &quot;sharing&quot;. And religious became &quot;spiritual&quot;.

But in 12X12, Bill stopped the pretense and yammered about &quot;sins&quot; in page after page.

<p>
<blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now let's ponder the need for a list of the more glaring personality defects
all of us have in varying degrees. To those who have religious training,
such a list would set forth serious violations of moral principles.
Some others will think of this list as defects of character.
Still others will call it an index of maladjustments.
Some will become quite annoyed if there is talk about immorality, let alone sin.
But all who are in the least reasonable will agree upon one point: that there
is plenty wrong with us alcoholics about which plenty will have to be
done if we are to expect sobriety, progress, and any real ability to cope with life.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To avoid falling into confusion over the names these defects should be called,
let's take a universally recognized list of major human failings &#8212; the Seven
Deadly Sins of pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, sloth. &nbsp; ...<br>

<p>
There is much more of Bill Wilson's crazy sermon on sin
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
This quote reveals that Bill Wilson's phrase &quot;character defects&quot; was really just a euphemism
for &quot;sins&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Since most of us are born with an abundance of natural desires,
it isn't strange that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#exceed_intended_purpose" target="_blank">we often let these far exceed</a>
their intended purpose.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times, Times Roman, Roman">
[Whose intended purpose? God's? Mother Nature's? The Force of Evolution's?]<br>
</font>
When they drive us blindly, or we willfully demand that they supply
us with more satisfactions or pleasures than are possible or due us,
that is the point at which we depart from the degree of perfection
that God wishes for us here on earth.<br>
<font color="blue" face="Times, Times Roman, Roman">
[How do we demand that desires supply us with satisfactions?
Desires are urges or wishes to get some satisfaction, not the source of satisfaction.
Hunger, for example, is the desire to get some food. Hunger does not give us any satisfaction,
it gives us a big pain in the belly.<br>
And <i>Just Who</i> is keeping the big account book that determines
how much pleasure is now <i>due us</i>?]<br>
</font>
That is the measure of our character defects, or, if you wish, of our sins.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 65.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So just measure how far away from perfection you are &#8212;
how far away from &quot;the degree of perfection
that God wishes for us here on earth&quot; you are &#8212;
and Bill Wilson says that is how much you sin.<br>
<p>
<p>
If we can control our desires, or let them &quot;exceed their intended purpose&quot;, then we are in
control of our drinking, so Step One is wrong. We are not powerless over alcohol.
<p>
And just what is &quot;God's intended purpose&quot; for our desire to drink alcohol?
<p>
Need I even mention the obvious conflict between the A.A. dogma of a loose,
free-form &quot;any Higher Power of your choosing&quot; (Step 2) and Bill Wilson's
scheming &quot;God&quot; who puts desires into people with the intention of
manipulating people in certain ways?
<p>
And how about the conflict with this statement, earlier in the same book? 
<blockquote>

<p>
First, you don't have to believe anything, and then you have to believe that God gave you desires with
intended purposes. That's another bait-and-switch trick:<br>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">
First, A.A. tells you that &quot;A.A. requires no beliefs,&quot; but then you have
to believe everything they tell you, and have blind faith in the proclamations of Bill Wilson</a>.

<p>
Bill Wilson wrote such insane bullshit, and the addled A.A.s just eat it up as if it's cosmic wisdom.
Oh well, that's just how cults work.

3. &quot;There is experimental
evidence that the A.A. doctrine of powerlessness leads to binge drinking. In a
sophisticated controlled study of A.A.'s effectiveness (Brandsma et. al.),
court-mandated offenders who had been sent to Alcoholics Anonymous for several
months were engaging in FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking as
another group of alcoholics who got no treatment at all, and the A.A. group was
doing NINE TIMES as much binge drinking as another group of
alcoholics who got rational behavior therapy.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
 Court-mandated offenders who had been
sent to Alcoholics Anonymous? As with your penicillin argument, the Steps of
Alcoholics Anonymous are for alcoholics. That means not all binge drinkers are
alcoholics. Not all court-mandated offenders are alcoholics. I have no idea what
effects the practice of the steps of Alcoholics Anonymous has on people that are not
alcoholic. Another issue I have are with the groups themselves. They say that
&quot;court-mandated offenders&quot; were sent to AA, then compare the binge drinking of those
to &quot;..another group of alcoholics&quot;, is confusing. What method did they use to
determine that control group, and the lay-RBT were alcoholics? And was this used on
the ones sent to A.A.? Yet, another problem with the research that I see is how thee
fact that they uses &quot;sessions&quot; and &quot;mean number of days treated&quot; in their numbers to
come to get their end dataset. The method of Alcoholics Anonymous is practicing the
steps of A.A.. It isn't about how many meetings you attend, or do not attend. Simply
attending meetings and not working the steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is NOT
following the program of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are quibbling about who is &quot;a real alcoholic&quot; or &quot;not a real alcoholic&quot;.
That does not change the fact that exposure to A.A. teachings <i>increased binge drinking</i>.
<p>
What, are you trying to claim that only normal people drink more as a result of A.A. teachings,
while &quot;real alcoholics&quot; drink less in A.A.? You've got to be kidding.

<p>
How they determined who went into the control group was RANDOM. They RANDOMLY selected who went into which group.
That is an essential feature of a
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">randomized longitudinal controlled study</a>.
Consequently, all of the members of the groups were equally alcoholics.
<p>
And now you are trying to claim that someone must practice the 12-Step cult religion to be a real member
of A.A. &quot;working the program&quot;.  But that is in direct conflict with the teachings that say that you don't
have to do that. The 12 Steps are supposedly only &quot;suggestions&quot;, remember? (<i>Big Book</i> page 59.)
That switcheroo is just some more bait-and-switch tricks:

<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#your_way" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that you can do it your way.

&quot;There are no <i>'MUSTS'</i> in Alcoholics Anonymous, only

 4. If nothing is done about
hopelessness, I can see that it does, indeed, lead to more suicides and uncontrolled
drinking.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, Bill Wilson's routine sure does not reduce depression or suicides.
</font>
<p>
 If somebody is disturbed by the question of alcoholism, why are they
disturbed? It disturbed me when I faced the possible reality that I may be an
alcoholic. That was a good disturbance. I was seeing my patterns of behavior. I was
seeing the possibilities. I was seeing where drinking was taking me over and over
again, and it disturbed me. As for the hopelessness, an alcoholic has no hope of
recovery if he/she continues to drink. That is a proven medical fact. There is
nothing bad about realizing how hopeless you are if you continue to drink alcohol.
While it may be &quot;vicious&quot;, it is the truth.
<p>
  Also a factor that nobody seems to
consider is the use of other harmful substances (nicotine). I'm sure there are
numbers out there that tell how many people that attend A.A. meetings (alcoholic or
not) smoke, or rationalize other legal (or non-legal) harmful drug use. Not to
mention the overall poor state of health that most alcoholics are in when they first
come into A.A.. I would assume that stuff that actually has been proven to kill
people is actually more likely to contribute or even cause death.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I have certainly considered it.
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">
 I've been harping on the issue of tobacco for the last 11 years</a>,
while A.A. members rationalize that smoking isn't so bad, and &quot;Well, I've got to keep <i>something</i>.&quot;
<p>
Again, you are trying to dodge the point. Dr. Vaillant compared A.A.-treated alcoholics to a population
of untreated alcoholics. Presumably, their other problems, like smoking and malnutrition, were about equal.
And Dr. Vaillant also compared the A.A. treatment results to the results from other treatment programs.
And the results were that A.A. had the highest death rate of any way of treating alcohol abuse and
alcohol addiction, or so-called &quot;alcoholism&quot;. And A.A. didn't improve on the sobriety rate at all.

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 &quot;Excuse me, but
no. The American Psychiatric Association very
deliberately did not &quot;loosely throw around&quot; the term &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
and they refused to even put that word in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders. It isn't in there, not anywhere. I've looked very
carefully, and it is not in there. &quot;

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
 What I meant was that the term &quot;alcoholism&quot; is
thrown around a lot by peope in general, not by the APA. I could have worded that
better. But the reason I brought it up is because alcoholism is defined as:  &quot;a
chronic disorder characterized by dependence on alcohol, repeated excessive use of
alcoholic beverages, the development of withdrawal symptoms on reducing or ceasing
intake, morbidity that may include cirhosis of the liver, and decreased ability to
function socially and vocationally&quot;.  I think the word &quot;chronic&quot; is where the line
is drawn, by definition, to set apart alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, and
alcoholism. Do you see where this might be a problem when, depending on where you
live, a first time DUI offense gets you mandatory AA? If you read that correctly,
you'd see it said &quot;.. AND decreased ...&quot;, which means all of those must be present
(minus cirhosis fo the liver) to define alcoholism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Whoa! You are throwing together <i>&quot;alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, and
alcoholism&quot;</i>, when &quot;alcoholism&quot; is still undefined.
Please define it, before you use it.
<p>
Are you trying to claim that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, only more so?

<p>
The talk about a first-timer DUI offender getting sentenced to A.A. meetings is pretty irrelevant
in a discussion of what constitutes &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
If you think about it, putting a bunch of non-alcoholic people into A.A. meetings should make A.A.
look more successful, because those people will be quickly &quot;cured&quot; of &quot;alcoholism&quot;.

</font>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 &quot;Alcohol Abuse&quot; means &quot;alcohol
abuse&quot;, not &quot;alcoholism&quot;, and &quot;Alcohol
Dependence&quot; means addiction to alcohol, not &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
&quot;Alcoholism&quot; is not a &quot;disease&quot;. Period. It is behavior. Drinking is
behavior. So is eating too much fatty or sugary food and getting fat. So is
smoking cigarettes. So is snorting cocaine. And shooting heroin. And on and on.
Just because someone is engaging in very bad unhealthy behavior does not mean
that he has a disease. (And it also does not mean that he is powerless.)&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
 When that
behavior (regarding alcohol), crosses over that line into a &quot;chronic disorder&quot; (see
definition above), you are an alcoholic, which is defined as a disease using my
definition of a disease that I got out of the dictionary (see previous e-mail). One
of the reasons for a dictionary is to establish a common definition for
communication sake. I'm sorry if you don't like the definition of disease from the
dictionary, but that is a lot more reliable than someone's opinion of what is and is
not a disease.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, stop right there. Using the vague dictionary definition of disease as anything that causes sickness
or discomfort is not applicable as a medical definition of a disease.
Again, by such a loose definition, eating too much ice cream and candy is a &quot;disease&quot;.
But when A.A. declares that &quot;alcoholism is a disease&quot;, they mean a real deadly medical disease,
not a vague discomfort. So the loose vague dictionary definition is not applicable.

</font>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Your very loose first dictionary definition of &quot;disease&quot; is worthless. By
that definition, children eating too much ice cream and candy produces the nasty
&quot;spiritual disease&quot; called &quot;candyism&quot; when they get a belly-ache.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, but it can contribute to type 2 diabetes (a disease), heart disease (yet another disease),<br>
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231339/http://www.fitsugar.com/Eating-Too-Much-Sugar-Leads-Heart-Disease-8190440" target="_blank">http://www.fitsugar.com/Eating-Too-Much-Sugar-Leads-Heart-Disease-8190440</a>)<br>
 and that
is important to note that the specific BEHAVIOR has shown that it CONTRIBUTES to a
disease. Alcohol consumption (drinking) IS a behavior, but that doesn't mean that
when it becomes chronic, it can't contribue to alcholism (a disease). If you have
your own definition of disease and how alcoholism does NOT qualify as a disease, I'm
all for it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are changing the subject. I said that children eating too much ice cream and candy is not the
&quot;spiritual disease&quot; of &quot;candyism&quot;.  That has nothing to do with the fact that if you chronically
consume too much sugar and too many carbohydrates, you will get diabetes. Of course you will. But that does not make
eating ice cream and candy &quot;a disease&quot;.
<p>
Furthermore, your explanation of &quot;alcoholism the disease&quot; is circular:
<ul>
<li> First, the alcoholic supposedly drinks too much alcohol because he has a
&quot;disease&quot; called &quot;alcoholism&quot;, and he is &quot;powerless&quot; over it.
(So it isn't &quot;a moral stigma&quot;.
See
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#symptom" target="_blank">&quot;Mrs.&quot; Marty Mann, the <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, Page 227</a>.)
<li> Then, drinking too much alcohol produces &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
Nonsense. So which came first, the &quot;alcoholism&quot;, or the drinking?
Do people drink alcohol because they have &quot;alcoholism&quot;, or do they have &quot;alcoholism&quot; because
they drink alcohol? It's a real chicken-and-egg problem, isn't it?

</font>

<p>
I really do enjoy learning new things (and it probably is on your
website somewhere). At least one of the studies you cite for the ineffectiveness of
AA refers to alcoholism as a disease. And, to bring it up again, National
Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions conducted by the The
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of
Health proves absolutely nothing about the efficiency of AA regarding alcoholics, as
it specifically states it refers to alcohol dependence, which I think we both seem
to agree is not the same as alcoholism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are quibbling about definitions. What they found is that A.A. is unnecessary, and most people who
suffer from &quot;alcohol dependence&quot; recover on their own without any A.A. &quot;help&quot;.
You are trying to differentiate &quot;alcoholism&quot; from &quot;alcohol dependence&quot;,
and claim that recovering from &quot;alcohol dependency&quot; is not like
recovering from &quot;alcoholism&quot;. But you were just equating them, and explaining &quot;alcoholism&quot; as being
&quot;alcohol dependence and alcohol addiction&quot; just a few paragraphs earlier, in order
to try to shoe-horn your ideas of &quot;the disease of alcoholism&quot; into the DSM-IV.
</font>
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;In addition, if a &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot; cuts down on his drinking and cleans up
his act and appears so sober that he is able to fool the doctors, how bad can
his drinking really be? Isn't it just possible that an &quot;alcoholic&quot; who improves
his lifestyle and his health to the point that he can routinely pass for sober
might really be &quot;recovered&quot;?&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just because a doctor is fooled, doesn't mean
injurious drinking is not still injurious or dangerous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are assuming that the drinking is so bad that it is &quot;injurious&quot;, and yet the doctor is
too blind to see it?
How do you get that? You imagine that somehow the doctor won't notice that somebody is drinking
himself to death? (That sure wasn't my experience with doctors.)
Again, that is the standard A.A. bias against real doctors. (Most quack medicine
rackets hate real doctors.)

I still see nothing other than correlation

website).

<p>

That file contains all of the valid
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>
that I have been able to find in the last 11 years. They test for <i>causation</i>, not correlation.

Not a lot in there I didn't already know about the brain, but it was an interesting

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It was not my
intention to imply you have not &quot;been to hell and back with alcohol&quot;, and I was
definitely not trying to use propaganda or &quot;tricks&quot; to imply you do not know what
you're talking about. As a matter of fact, I never said you &quot;didn't know what you're
talking about because you haven't had the 'special experiences' that [I] have&quot;. If
you were to say that Alcoholics Anonymous did not help me, I WOULD say you do not
know what you are talking about, because you don't know what happened to me or what
helped me (but that is merely just my own personal experience), and that would be
fair of me to say (not propaganda at all). I was running out of time and trying to
end the e-mail, so I'll rephrase it: Alcoholism took me to a pretty dark place. I
believe that the transformation from what I was to what I am now has been a miracle.
In addition, I applaud any alcoholic who has overcome alcoholism (no matter the
method).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay.
</font>
<p>

To sum it up: I see &quot;controlled studies&quot; done that send one group of people
who may not even be alcoholic to A.A. meetings, and another group of people that
might not be alcoholic to a different program (or in some cases, none at all). If
the death rate is higher for A.A. meetings, A.A. is to blame for the death rate
increase. That is correlation, NOT causation, and a logical fallacy.<br>

<br>
Again, the above is just my $0.02.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, if non-alcoholics get sent to A.A. meetings (something that I am very opposed to), it will
make A.A. look better, because
<i>&quot;Look at how quickly A.A. cured them of alcoholism!&quot;</i>.
<p>
The same goes for sending non-alcoholics to &quot;treatment programs&quot;.
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Cora">what Cora Finch wrote</a>
years ago, about the exaggerated &quot;success rates&quot; of treatment centers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It comes down to two things, baseline and outcome. Both can be
defined in a variety of ways, or left undefined.
<p>
The &quot;best&quot; numbers come from studies with the highest baseline. Take
highly-paid professionals who have had a DIU and get a lot of
hangovers. In 1940 they would have been considered ordinary people.
But now we can count them as alcoholics and put them in a diversion
program with the threat of losing their jobs and &#8212;
Wow, what a success rate!
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, those
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>
test for <i>causation</i>, not <i>correlation</i>. The whole point of doing an RLCS is to avoid
the confusion of causation and correlation.
You keep trying to dismiss all valid tests of A.A. as merely showing &quot;correlation&quot;, which is not the case.
<p>
That is like trying to claim that there is merely a &quot;correlation&quot; between taking penicillin and having nasty
streptococcus infections die out.
<i>Not!</i> It isn't just a coincidence or &quot;correlation&quot; when
infections disappear after you take penicillin. There are real cause-and-effect relationships in this world.
And some that have been established are:
<ul>
<li> Penicillin and other antibiotics kill bacteria.
<li> A.A. increases binge drinking, costs of hospitalization, and deaths.
</ul>

Subject: 	Re: Orange Papers as ebook<br>
From: 	&quot;Meatbag&quot;<br>

<p>
Good news is I did figure out the DRM situation. I couldn't crack the
DRM on either OS of my laptop. I had to use my gaming rig, and the tools
worked on that. I suspect the reason it only worked on the desktop is it
had an older version of Adobe Digital Editions on it. DeDRMing some new
books I bought from Amazon, on the other hand, worked just fine on the
Linux side of my laptop (if it works on Linux, I don't care about
Windows). I know exactly where I'm going to be buying my ebooks now. Of
course, no DRM at all would be even better.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Meatbag,
<p>
I agree. No DRM would be much better. One of the big reasons why I refuse to buy an
Apple iPad is because the music must be all locked up in the odd iPad iTunes format.
The heck with that noise. I play MP3s and FLAC files with no locks on them.

<p>
Again, it's the &quot;closed system&quot; philosophy versus the open system. Linux is open, so I run Linux.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Orange,

<p>
Good to see numbers on the site are growing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Jim,
<p>
Yes, it really surprised me how much it is sky-rocketing lately.
At the beginning of last month, I doubted that the web site would get 2 million hits for the month, because
of the usual summer slump.
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/webstats" target="_blank">The count actually went over 2 1/2 million</a>.
If it keeps climbing like that, it will be 3 million hits this month.

</font>
<p>
I am now over 3 years without a meeting and life is just dandy.......even though
their are many frustrations and difficulties currently; life is dandy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Great.
</font>
<p>
Overall, I am now some 9 years sober and can honestly say, that any 'real' or
'sincere' Spiritual growth, did not 'genuinely' start till I pulled away from those
rooms.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Understandable.
</font>
<p>
I did speak with an old AA friend the other day and when after some telephone
knockabout and fun, it was offered to him that I didn't attend meetings any more (
He asked ); the mood quite clearly changed.

<p>
I was offered the following.......&quot;Lots of meetings, lots of chances; few meetings,
few chances; no meetings, no chance!&quot; and this gem &quot;We (note the Royal 'we')
Alcoholics ride a bike uphill and when we stop peddling we slide backwards.&quot;

<p>
It deeply saddened me you know.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>
I would highly recommend a book to you, if I may (providing you haven't read it
already)...... Its called 'AWARENESS' by ANTHONY DE MELLO. What a beautiful book
and what a beautiful man.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'll check it out. No, I haven't read it.
</font>
<p>
Keep up the tremendous work for the sake of sanity and truth!!!!

<p>
And as my old friend Neil Young once snarled with brutal sarcasm &quot;Keep On Rockin'
In The Free World&quot; !!!!!<br>
(Some of the sleeping masses thought this was a pro American
song)........!!!!!!      There is indeed much work to be done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<p>
God bless you,

<p>
Jim.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks, and you have a good day too, Jim.
