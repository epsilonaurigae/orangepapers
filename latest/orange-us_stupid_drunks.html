During the U.S. civil war, when President Lincoln was considering
turning command of all of the Union armies over to General Grant,
one of Lincoln's aids cautioned the President,
&quot;Sir, you should know that Grant is a terrible alcoholic.&quot;
<P>
Lincoln replied, &quot;Oh yeh? Well, find out what kind of whiskey
he drinks, and send a case of it to all of my other generals. Maybe
they'll get off of their asses and do something.&quot;
-->

This is President Abraham Lincoln, speaking to John M. Thayer, a brigadier
from General Ulysses S. Grant's army, about the complaints about General
Grant's drinking:
<p>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Delegation after delegation has called on me with the same request,
'Recall Grant from command,' as the members of the delegations were not willing
that their sons and brothers should be under the control of an intemperate
leader. I could not think of relieving him, and these demands became
very vexatious. I therefore hit upon this plan to stop them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;One day a delegation headed by a distinguished doctor of divinity from New York,
called on me and made the familiar complaint and protest against Grant being retained
in his command. After the clergyman had concluded his remarks, I asked if any others
desired to add anything to what had already been said. They replied that they did not.
Then looking as serious as I could, I said:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;'Doctor, can you tell me where General Grant gets his liquor?'&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;'The doctor seemed quite nonplussed, but replied that he could not. I then said to
him:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;'I am very sorry, for if you could tell me I would direct the Chief Quartermaster
of the army to lay in a large stock of the same kind of liquor, and would also direct
him to furnish a supply to some of my other generals who have never yet won a victory.'&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lincoln handed Thayer a friendly slap on the leg, lay back in his chair, had a laugh,
and resumed:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;What I want and what the people want is Generals who will fight battles and win
victories. Grant has done this and I propose to stand by him. I permitted this incident
to get into print, and I have been troubled no more with delegations protesting against
Grant. Somehow or other I have always felt a leaning toward Grant. Ever since he sent
that message to Buckner, 'No terms but unconditional surrender,' I have felt that he was
a man I could tie to, though I have never seen him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, noted that when overzealous people had accused Grant
of intemperance, Lincoln's reply was, &quot;If I knew what brand of whiskey he drinks
I would send a barrel or so to some other generals.&quot;

Many A.A. members participate in a tacit conspiracy to
stereotype alcoholics. And the
picture they paint of themselves isn't a pretty one.
</font>

<p>
<a name="apocryphal"> </a>
<a name="AA_name"> </a>
In the book <i>Bill W.</i> by Robert Thomsen, the author
tells the story of how the &quot;Big Book&quot; got its name back
in the year 1939:
<p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Akron favored &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous,&quot; New York &quot;The
Way Out.&quot; Another burning issue, another impasse, and one that
was resolved only when Bill sent a wire to Fitz in Maryland asking
him to go to Washington and find out how many &quot;Way Out&quot;s were
registered at the Library of Congress. Fitz's reply informed them
that there were already twelve books entitled &quot;The Way Out&quot; and,
as far as he could discover, no &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot; That did
it. No drunk was going to risk being the thirteenth
anything. The book had its title, the fellowship had a name.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.</i>, Robert Thomsen, pp. 285-6.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The key sentence is
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;No drunk was going to risk being
the thirteenth anything.&quot;</i></font>
All I can
say is:
<font color="blue">
&quot;That's funny. I was an alcoholic for twenty years,
and I never had a problem with being
the sixth, or the twelfth, or the thirteenth anything. And I
can't think of any drinking buddies
who were particularly superstitious about the number 13. So why
are you writing such garbage about us alcoholics?&quot;
</font>

<p>
I'm not singling out that particular book for any special criticism;
that book
is just another pro-A.A. book that follows the standard A.A. party
line about everything. The Big
Book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> is far worse when it comes to
stereotyping alcoholics. And Bill Wilson's second book
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> is even worse than that one.

<p>
The author, Robert Thomsen, could have described the situation something like this:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;Bill Wilson and the other founders of A.A. decided not
to use a name that had already been used, by other people, for
other things, a dozen times over.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</blockquote>

Or he could have written,<br>

<blockquote>
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;The A.A. founders sensibly decided to use an original
name, rather than one that had been already been used so many
times, by so many other people.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Those would have been honest, factual statements.
But Thomsen didn't do that; instead, he slipped a stereotyped slur
against alcoholics into the text:<br>

<blockquote>
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;No drunk was going to risk being the thirteenth anything.
The book had its title, the fellowship had a name.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice how Thomsen implied that those A.A. members were afraid to take a risk,
and implied that they were superstitious, afraid to risk the number 13.
<a name="drunks"> </a>
Notice how Thomsen called those early A.A. members
&quot;drunks,&quot; in spite of the fact that they weren't drunk.
None of those people had any alcohol in their bodies.
They were the successful A.A. members who had been sober for months
or years. A.A. members often call
themselves &quot;drunks&quot; too, even when they aren't drunk.
<p>
Such self-deprecation is supposed to be
part of the &quot;different&quot; A.A. humor, but it's all part of
the tacit wink-and-a-grin conspiracy to
stereotype alcoholics. A.A. members actually gladly and gleefully
participate in stereotyping
themselves, because it makes them feel different from the
&quot;normal people&quot;, and special, and also
part of a group. (It's a propaganda mind game called &quot;creating a
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#granfalloon">granfalloon</a></i>&quot;.)
<p>
Also, promoting the idea that &quot;we are all alike&quot;
allows some people to avoid their own
feelings of inferiority relative to others in the group, and also
allows them to avoid assuming
personal responsibility for their past actions. It allows some
people who have been really vicious
cruel sickos to feel that nobody else is any better than them:
<font color="#5f008f">
<b>&quot;Us stupid drunks, ha ha, we are all alike,
and just look at what alcohol made us do.&quot;</b>
</font>
<p>
It's just like Flip Wilson's character <i>Geraldine</i>, who was always
saying, &quot;It isn't my fault. The Devil made me do it.&quot;<br>
In A.A.,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcohol made me do it. We are all the same because alcohol made us all do bad things.&quot;<br>
</font>
Promoting the disease concept of alcoholism, and
claiming that alcoholics can't control the disease, is just more
of the same talk, just another way to avoid taking personal
responsibility for one's own life.

<p>
Thus, the author, Robert Thomsen, could tell the absurd story that
Alcoholics Anonymous got its name because
<i>&quot;no drunk was going to risk being the thirteenth anything&quot;</i>,
and no A.A. members objected to
such nonsense. They had plenty of opportunities to object: The
author states in the foreword that
he knew and worked beside Bill Wilson for the last twelve years of
Bill's life. (That means that Thomsen was almost certainly an A.A.
member, and even worked at the A.A. national headquarters, alongside
Bill Wilson.)
Many high-ranking A.A.
members, including the A.A. archivist and General Service Board
staff members helped in the
creation of the book. But it seems that none of them objected to
that line about how Alcoholics
Anonymous got its name because of the mental peculiarities or
superstitions of those early
alcoholic members. Of course not, they liked such stereotyping.
Robert Thomsen probably learned it from them.
<p>
That is especially likely in light of the fact that Thomsen's
book was based on a set of autobiographical tape recordings that Bill
Wilson made before his death. (The Hazelden &quot;autobiography&quot;,
<i>&quot;Bill W.:
My First 40 Years&quot;</i>, ostensibly written by Bill Wilson,
but actually ghost-written by Hazelden staff members,
was also based on that same set of tapes.)
So Robert Thomsen got the &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; routine
straight from Bill Wilson.

<center><table width="87%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

It is likely that Bill Wilson's entire story about having to decide between the names
&quot;The Way Out&quot; and &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; is apocryphal, just like
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">so many of Bill's other stories about A.A.
history</a>.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font>

<p>
The simple truth is that the Salvation Army had been using the name
&quot;The Way Out&quot; for their religious cure for alcoholism ever
since 1890, when General William Booth published his book,
<i><b>&quot;In Darkest England and the Way Out&quot;</b></i>.
For Bill Wilson to come along in 1938 and use the same name for his book about 
his &quot;new&quot; religious cure for alcoholism would not have been
very original, to put it mildly.
<p>
And considering how much the Salvation Army works with derelict alcoholics
and street drunks, it is extremely unlikely that all of those original
A.A. members could have been so ignorant of the Salvation Army program
and its terminology.
<p>
Lastly, Clarence Snyder over in Cleveland, Ohio, had already been using the
name &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; for his group of alcoholics for a while. It was
Snyder who created the &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; name for the organization
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Clarence_Snyder" target="_blank">when he and his group of alcoholics
broke away from the Oxford Group cult</a>.
Hence the Ohio alcoholics wanted the book to have the &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; name.
<p>
Bill Wilson was extremely reluctant to give Clarence Snyder the credit
for creating the &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; name (or for anything else),
and you almost never read about that in official A.A. &quot;council-approved&quot;
literature. Here, Robert Thomson repeated Bill Wilson's cover-up. He
wrote only that &quot;Akron favored 'Alcoholics Anonymous'&quot; without mentioning why.

Few indeed are the practicing alcoholics who have any idea how irrational they
are, or seeing their irrationality, can bear to face it.
Some will be willing to term themselves &quot;problem drinkers,&quot;

What nonsense. That was a poor alcoholic talking, not an Enron executive.
And part of his problem was that he was caring for other alcoholics instead
of making money, and he felt that he was under a lot of pressure and stress
because of it, so he thought about taking a drink to relax. Nevertheless,
the author still had to parrot the standard &quot;selfishness&quot; cult dogma (but

Terence Gorski says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In most Twelve Step literature, the addictive self is called the &quot;ego.&quot;
Whenever I hear or read the word <i>ego</i>, I substitute the words
<i>addictive self</i>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The goal of a Fourth Step is to deflate the ego &#8212; or, in other words,
to deflate the addictive self. The addictive self is marked by
grandiosity (addicted people feel that they are more than or better
than everyone else) and self-centeredness (they believe that they
are the center of the universe and there is little room left for
anyone or anything else).<br>
</font>

<p>
That whole statement is ridiculous. Alcoholics and addicts do not get
high because they suffer from delusions of grandeur; they get high because
they feel bad and they want to feel good.
<p>
And Gorski gives us a grossly incorrect

of &quot;ego&quot;.
Nobody else uses that definition.
<p>
<a href="orange-definitions.html#ego2">
A more realistic definition is:</a>
<br>
<i>Your ego is your idea of what you are</i>,<br>

We are told in Al-Anon that there can be no progress without humility.
This idea is confusing to many at first, and it almost always encounters
a stubborn resistance in us. &quot;What!&quot; we say, &quot;am I
supposed to be a submissive slave to my situation and accept
everything that comes, however humiliating?&quot; No. True humility
does not mean a meek surrender to an ugly, destructive way of life.
It means surrender to God's will, which is quite a different thing.
Humility prepares us for the realization of God's will for us;
it shows us the benefits we gain from doing away with self-will.
We finally understand how this self-will has actually contributed to
our distress.<br>

So, you got it right the first time, lady. You are supposed to be

<font size="-1">(<a href="#tsatt">12X12</a>, page 72.)</font>
So all of the innocent-sounding appeals for humility are not
requests for people to avoid egotism; they are really
demands that people to give up &quot;self-will&quot; (taking care of yourself,
making your own decisions,
and running your own life) and &quot;surrender to God's will&quot;

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once upon a time there was an Enormous Thumb belonging to a woman with
an Alcoholic Husband and Three Teenaged Children.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The four of them lived under her thumb, so of course they couldn't
do much growing up. Often their spirits writhed under the weight;
every time they tried to get out from under, they'd do something
wrong and the thumb would clamp down on them again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Father managed by keeping himself flattened out drunk most of the
time; he was so cute about escaping to a bottle that, no matter how
much mama watched, she couldn't catch him at it until he'd drunk
himself into unconsciousness. Everyone thought she was a Very Nice
Lady, and they were sorry she was having such a hard time with
her family.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There was really no reason for her to come to Al-Anon to solve her
problems because she always knew just what to do about everything.
But she did want to make her husband stop drinking, so she thought
she'd try it. She was quite unhappy at first because some of the
members were not inclined to Pull any Punches. She was quite
indignant when they tried to show her what she was doing to her
family, but to everyone's amazement the Thumb began to shrink
and lose weight, and things looked brighter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
More and more she realized what she was doing and, being a
Determined Character, she applied the program every day and
her other problems took care of themselves very nicely.<br>

plenty of stereotypical put-downs of alcoholics too (in addition to Bill Wilson's).
The following confessions make heavy use of the technique of

&quot;I'm saying <i>'I'</i> but I mean <i>'you'</i>, because us stupid
alcoholics are all alike, and you also need to learn what I learned...&quot;

Dr. Sydney Cohen offered Bill several pills, and told Bill to take one.
Bill said, &quot;Don't ever do that to a drunk,&quot; and he took two.
<p>
Don't ever do that to drunk? They can't control themselves with anything?

(I notice that Bill Wilson was actually taking pride in his behavior.
Being extreme was part of Bill's ego. He was actually boasting about how
selfish and self-indulgent and out of control he was. It reminds me of

Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this

The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of
concrete principles
that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out
of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps
which people wiggled out of.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson considered his fellow alcoholics to be such a bunch of
dishonest slippery cheaters that they had to be
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil">locked into an iron-clad contract</a>
from which no escape was possible, or else those
drunken bums would &quot;wiggle out of&quot; the &quot;spiritual&quot;
work. That's a pretty poor opinion of your fellow A.A. members.
How can A.A. be such a wonderful organization if the members are
all so bad?

<a name="lash_of_alcoholism"> </a>
In his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
Wilson even declared that alcoholics are such worthless, immoral louts
that they must be beaten into submission:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Why all this insistence that every A.A. member must hit bottom first?
The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the A.A.
program unless they have hit bottom. For practicing A.A.'s remaining
eleven Steps means the adoption of attitudes and actions that almost
no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking. Who wishes to
be rigorously honest and tolerant?
Who wants to confess his faults to another and make restitution for
harm done? Who cares anything about a Higher Power, let alone
meditation and prayer? Who wants to sacrifice time and energy in
trying to carry A.A.'s message to the next sufferer? No, the average
alcoholic, self-centered in the extreme, doesn't care for this
prospect &#8212; unless he has to do these things in order to stay
alive himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Under the lash of alcoholism, we are driven to A.A., and there
we discover the fatal nature of our situation.
Then, and only then, do we become as open-minded to conviction and
as willing to listen as the dying can be.</font><br>

In 1955, at the A.A. twentieth anniversary convention, Bill Wilson said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little. They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts  &#8212; absolute purity, absolute 
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently 
too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>

So, according to Bill Wilson, you should even feel guilty and
inadequate for not liking authoritarian fascism &#8212; you wish to
<i>&quot;cling to your other defects.&quot;</i><br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Frank Buchman's cult used the very same technique &#8212; that is where
Bill Wilson learned it &#8212; they accused anyone
who dared to criticize Frank Buchman, his teachings, or his pro-Nazi politics,
of being immoral and sinful: guilty of
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot120.html#van_Dusen_Atlantic2">perhaps the
rationalization of some grave hidden weakness or the sin of jealousy or
laziness or cowardice</a>&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...opposition to Moral Re-Armament has special significance.
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#no_criticism">It always comes from the morally defeated</a>&quot;.
</font>
</font>
<p>
And of course Bill Wilson assumed that he was spiritual enough to handle
high-falutin' morality like The Four Absolutes, even if the average A.A. member was
just a stupid loser who didn't want to get too good too soon.

<p><br><center><img src="/web/20160508135300im_/http://orange-papers.org/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<p>
Obviously, William Wilson had nothing but hatred and contempt for
his fellow alcoholics. I know that that directly contradicts the conceit
that Bill spent the second half of his life selflessly helping other
alcoholics and serving their needs like some great self-sacrificing saint.
He didn't; he spent the second half of his life building a cult religion,
making himself the leader, and making other alcoholics his
fawning followers and brown-nosing slaves who supported him in
luxurious comfort for the rest of his life.
Bill Wilson got a free house in the country
(<i>&quot;Stepping Stones&quot;</i>), a free Cadillac car,
and enough money that he never had to work again,
as well as
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">countless mistresses</a>,
while he exhorted all
of the other alcoholics to abandon self-seeking, to quit being so
selfish, and to give up all thought of the profit motive.
Bill Wilson even wanted the national Alcoholics Anonymous headquarters to
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Helen">pay his mistress, Helen Wynn,
for him</a>, but they balked at that one,
and told Bill to pay her himself.
Bill was furious at their effrontery.

<p><br>
The first two standard rules of any cult are:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
1) <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right">The guru is always right</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
2) <a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong">You are always wrong</a>.<br>
<p>
The greater the guru is, the less you are. The guru and his teachings
are above questioning, and you are completely unqualified &#8212;
too stupid, too ignorant, too unspiritual, too sinful, too evil, too new &#8212;
to judge the guru or his teachings. The properly-behaved
followers never question the guru; they accept their subservient role.<br>
<font color="blue">
<b>The guru criticizes the followers, but they never criticize the guru.</b>
</font>

<p>
But the average alcoholic &quot;out on the streets&quot; would
not believe in Bill Wilson's grandiose delusions, or join his
cult religion, or follow his orders, or even agree with him,
so Bill hated them and spoke of them with nothing but sneering
contempt:<br>

<a name="12X12q12"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Let's look first at the
case of the one who says he won't believe &#8212; the belligerent
one. He is in a state of mind which can be described only as
savage.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>

Rather vain of us, wasn't it?<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 49.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Neither was the average alcoholic
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;<b>as open-minded to conviction
and as willing to listen as the dying can be</b>&quot;</i>
</font>
&#8212; that is, eager to masochistically <i><b>Convict</b></i> himself,
to find himself guilty of sins.
This is another one of the peculiarities of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman's sick cult
religion</a> slipping into Alcoholics Anonymous, again &#8212;
<b>Conviction</b>, one of the
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#conviction">Five C's</a>&quot;.

<p>
<a name="12X12q13"> </a>
<blockquote>

<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 24.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Only the truly <b>desperate, dying</b> people could be
made to do what Bill Wilson wanted,
so, according to Bill, those horrible evil alcoholics had to
be beaten with the lash of alcoholism, and forced to do the good
and right thing &#8212; to join A.A., and surrender their minds to the group,
and do Bill's Twelve Steps, and Convict themselves of all kinds of sins...

<p>
I have sat in A.A. meetings, and heard people share the
&quot;wisdom&quot; that all alcoholics have
short fuses, and are quick to anger, and have little ability to
tolerate frustration or pain. I've also
heard that all alcoholics are selfish and care about nothing but
drinking and getting their own creature comforts.
I've also heard that all alcoholics become violent brutes when they
get drunk, and beat up their friends and wives and kids.
But that doesn't match my own experiences at all.
It doesn't match even half of the alcoholics I've known.
It does match a rare few, but only a very rare few.
<p>
But new A.A. members get indoctrinated with such ideas as soon
as they start attending
meetings. You just wanted to quit drinking, and now you are
being told what all of your standard
character defects (sins) are? And if you object, and say that you
aren't like that, your sponsor or
another elder is liable to accuse you of being in denial about your
true nature. Somehow, I don't think
that is helpful. In fact, I believe that it is very harmful to
a lot of people.
<p>

The A.A. coins say,<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;To thine own self be true&quot;</font>,<br>
not<br>
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;Use this coin to buy stereotypes of yourself.&quot;
</font>

<p><br><center><img src="/web/20160508135300im_/http://orange-papers.org/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

It's interesting to note that A.A. isn't alone in this habit of
applying negative stereotypes to alcoholics and drug addicts. Chuck
Dederich, the leader of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="_blank">the drug and alcohol recovery program turned crazy cult called Synanon</a>,
 said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Addicts are emotional children who won't gamble.
Addicts, like children, want a sure thing.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Tunnel Back, Synanon</i>, Lewis Yablonsky,
page 398.</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is obviously false, totally untrue, and complete nonsense.
Addicts take crazy chances, totally insane chances,
and live lives of great uncertainty,
and <i><b>often</b></i> lose their lives on a bad gamble, like,
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;I think I can do this much without overdosing. This isn't too
much, is it?&quot;</i></font> or
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;I think he gave me smack, not cleanser, so I'll shoot it and see.&quot;</i></font>

<p>
Another Synanon member echoed the attack on Synanon members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You lifestylers are so goddamn dumb that you think the
Synanon miracle
has no limitations &#8212; not true! When you are up against nine-fingered
cats like me &#8212; you are dealing with 'damaged goods'.
Can't you get that through your skull? Give a dopefiend an inch
and he'll take your ruler. Bring something broken in two pieces
to one of our Homer Half-Heads and say 'Fix it,' and he'll return
it to you in four pieces, exulting that 'It's fixed!' It may interest
you to know that management has, in fact, decided to eliminate
repair jobs from our service stations. The risk is just too great.
The Peter Principle of our monkies is exceeded when they are asked
to do more than get the gas in the right hole.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Escape From Utopia: My Ten Years in Synanon</i>, William F. Olin,
page 139.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It's interesting to note that those remarks were addressed to the
author, William F. Olin,, a &quot;life-styler&quot; who was a successful architect
outside of Synanon
&#8212; a non-addict who joined Synanon for the Utopian communal lifestyle.
And Synanon also had another member who was a doctor, and
there were many more members with professional skills.
But according to that condescending speaker, all Synanon members were stupid dope
fiends who couldn't be trusted with anything more complex than
pumping gasoline.

<p>
Such denigration of the addict is just another way for the cult or its
leader to control the individual members by making them feel small and
inferior. Calling them &quot;children&quot; enhances the effect of
making the leader more powerful and the followers weaker. In
some cults, like Reverend Jim Jones' People's Temple (the one where
914 people committed suicide for Jones),
the leader was even called &quot;Father,&quot; while he called the
followers &quot;my children.&quot;

<p>
Bill Wilson had the same condescending attitude towards his fellow alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We shall have our childish spats and snits over small questions of money
management and who is going to run our groups for the next six months.
Any bunch of growing children (and that is what we are) would hardly be in
character if they did less.<br>

and<br>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 233.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson used the same wording when he explained how everyone had to be
&quot;controlled by God&quot;, which is
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#God_control">pure Buchmanism</a>.
Wilson denounced taking care of yourself and
being free to live your own life as
&quot;playing God&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
First of all, we had to quit playing God. It didn't work. Next, we
decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our
Director. He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are
His children. &nbsp; ...<br>
... We had a new Employer.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
But being &quot;controlled by God&quot; ended up being
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#check_guidance">controlled by the
A.A. elders</a>&quot; who interpret the neophytes'
<i>&quot;Guidance&quot;</i> for them, and tell
them what God <i>really</i> says.

I strongly suspect that a big part of the reason for this <i>&quot;Us Stupid
Drunks&quot;</i> routine is to break down the ego of the new convert,
to subvert his will to resist.
The newcomer won't <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender
to the cult</a> until he despairs of saving himself.
The newcomer must believe that he is incapable of helping himself,
that he is so flawed and broken and defective that he has to give up
on himself, and believe that something, some Power greater than himself,
like the group or God, will fix him.
Many parts of the program are designed to break down the newcomer's mind,
will, and self-confidence, by inducing guilt and self-doubt,
and this <i>&quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot;</i> conspiracy is one of them.
<p>
Note that there is a strong power game going on in the <i>&quot;Us Stupid
Drunks&quot;</i> conspiracy. At a meeting, the speaker will denigrate
himself, and list all of his terrible character flaws and shortcomings.
He tells the tale of his horrible alcoholic history and all of the
bad things that he did.
He makes himself unassailable by doing that.
You cannot very well then jump on him and accuse him of being a sack
of motherfuckers. He just said that he was. But then a subtle mind
game starts: the speaker implies that you are just as bad.
&quot;Alcoholics are like that,&quot; he says, and everybody around you grins
and nods.
(And they might say that he is being <i>completely honest</i>, and if
you would be <i>completely honest</i> too, then you would admit that you also had
such defects of character and moral shortcomings.)
But then he claims or implies that because he has been
working on the problem for many years, with the help of A.A., he has
made at least some small amount of
progress in overcoming the problem. But you, you immoral newcomer,
you have not. So he is your moral superior, and you should
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender
your will to him</a> and let him be your sponsor and tell you what to
do with your life.<br>
<font color="blue">
(And then there is the threat that if you won't conform and follow the
program, your fate will be <i>&quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot;</i>.)

<a name="darkness"> </a>
<a name="12X12q14"> </a>
The Alcoholics Anonymous literature teaches self-contempt and self-loathing.
One of the saddest examples of this is Bill Wilson's second book, 
<a href="#tsatt"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions.</i></a>
By the time Bill wrote that, in 1952, he was deep into his
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">madness</a>,
in the middle of an eleven-year bout of deep, crippling,
clinical depression, and he just raved hatred of alcoholics
nonstop for 192 pages. He had jewels of self-contempt
and self-loathing like this to offer to newcomers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now let's ponder the need for a list of the more glaring personality defects
all of us have in varying degrees. To those who have religious training,
such a list would set forth serious violations of moral principles.
Some others will think of this list as defects of character.
Still others will call it an index of maladjustments.
Some will become quite annoyed if there is talk about immorality, let alone sin.
But all who are in the least reasonable will agree upon one point: that there
is plenty wrong with us alcoholics about which plenty will have to be
done if we are to expect sobriety, progress, and any real ability to cope with life.<br>
<a name="security_society"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To avoid falling into confusion over the names these defects should be called,
let's take a universally recognized list of major human failings &#8212; the Seven
Deadly Sins of pride, greed, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, sloth. It is not
by accident that pride heads the procession. For pride,
leading to self-justification, and always spurred by conscious or
unconscious fears, is the basic breeder of most human difficulties,
the chief block to true progress. Pride lures us into making demands upon
ourselves or upon others which cannot be met without perverting or misusing
our God-given instincts. When the satisfaction of our instincts
for sex, security, and society becomes the sole object of our lives, then
pride steps in to justify our excesses.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All these failings generate fear, a soul-sickness in its own right.
Then fear, in turn, generates more character defects. Unreasonable
fear that our instincts will not be satisfied drives us to covet the
possessions of others, to lust for sex and power, to become angry when
our instinctive demands are threatened, to be envious when the ambitions
of others seem to be realized which ours are not. We eat, drink, and grab
for more of everything than we need, fearing we shall never have enough.
And with genuine alarm at the prospect of work, we stay lazy. We loaf and
procrastinate, or at least work grudgingly and under half steam. These fears
are the termites that ceaselessly devour the foundations of whatever sort of
life we try to build.<br>

<p>

Whew! Have you ever seen such a twisted and warped view of human life?
Talk about wallowing in self-hatred!
(And that is just a tiny part of that book.
That's just the first piece of junk
that I picked out. The whole rest of the book is like that too.)
It is obvious that Bill is teaching self-contempt,
and working hard to induce
guilt and self-doubt in every reader.
<p>
And he shoves it all at us under the guise of
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;We alcoholics are like this.
There is plenty wrong with us alcoholics.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I have to say, &quot;Speak for yourself, Bill, I'm not like that.
I may not be perfect, but I'm sure not like that.&quot;
<p>
Starting at the top, Bill moronically talked about,
&quot;To those who have religious training, such a list would set forth serious
violations of moral principles.&quot;<br>

<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Gee, duh, God? Duh, I never heard of him.
I never got none of that-there religious training stuff...
Duh...&quot;</i><br>
</font>

But those of us who have heard of God had better start feeling
guilty: we are talking about
some <i>serious</i> violations of moral principles here!

</font></td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
And then, for us dummies without religious training,
Bill said he was going to give us a list of
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;defects of character&quot;</font>, or an
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;index of maladjustments&quot;</font>.
<p>
Then he launched a preemptive attack on those people who might disagree
with him:
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Some will become quite annoyed if there is talk
about immorality, let alone sin.&quot;
</font>
Then he said,
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;But all who are in the least reasonable will agree...&quot;
</font>
If you don't agree with Bill, then you are &quot;unreasonable.&quot;
And I'll bet you are an atheist and really evil, too,
and that's why you object to any talk about
&quot;immorality&quot; and &quot;sin.&quot;
It just seems to be part of Bill's
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">paranoia</a> that
he always has to get that dig
in there, attacking those who will disagree with him, even before anyone has had
a chance to disagree.

<p>
<a name="rings_true"> </a>
Then Bill launched into some heavy self-contempt:
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<b>&quot;there is plenty wrong with us alcoholics...&quot;</b>
</font>
<p>
Now let's not be &quot;unreasonable&quot; here. There may indeed be
some things wrong with recovering alcoholics that need to be fixed &#8212; 
maybe even &quot;plenty of things.&quot;
But watch carefully: there is no fix offered. Not really.
Just a chance to feel guilt and self-contempt.
Just a chance to feel so bad about yourself that you give up, and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender to the cult</a>
in despair, and become converted into a crazy cult member.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>This is just so typical of Bill's insanity:
everything he says almost rings true,
it almost has some truth in it, you can see what he is getting at and
almost agree with it, but there is just something a little bit <i>off</i>
about all of it.</b>
</font>
<p>
Bill will go on and on and on for a whole book,
and tell you that you have to do the Twelve Steps
because we are all so sinful, but
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">he actually has
no fix to offer you</a>.
Claiming that the Twelve Steps will magically fix you is not a fix.
Claiming that God will zap you in Step Seven and take away all of your
defects of character and moral shortcomings is not a fix.
Claiming that you must surrender your will and your life to
God, A.A., and your sponsor because you are so rotten is not a fix.
<p>

Bill just exhorts us to wallow in self-contempt, shame, and guilt,
and make
lists of all of our faults and defects &#8212; this being our Fourth Step
&#8212; without having any real healing or therapy to offer.
Bill claims that God will smile on us if we do the Twelve Steps,
and that we will attain some kind of bliss, Gratitude and Serenity,
and arrive in some kind of Heaven on Earth if
we work the Steps thoroughly enough, but that's it.

Bill wrote in the Big Book
<font size="-1">(page 100)</font>,<br>

<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently
live in a new and wonderful world, no matter what your present
circumstances!&quot;</font>
<p>
That's Bill's plan for you. Obviously, we have a big problem with
recovery if God isn't a dictator... And this is uncomfortably reminiscent
of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler">
Frank Buchman's admiration of Hitler</a>, and desire to see the whole world run
by Christian Fascist dictators who would force Buchmanism on everybody else
in the world.
<p>
But suppose God really is a Fascist Dictator, and we really are supposed
to follow His orders. How do we get those orders? Buchmanism comes to
the rescue again: we receive
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">
Guidance</a>. That means that we sit quietly
and hallucinate that God is talking to us and giving us orders.
In A.A., this is known as Step Eleven:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious
contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of
His will for us and the power to carry that out.&quot;</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

So, we should mistake our own random thoughts and the jabbering of our
subconscious
minds for <i>The Voice Of God</i>, dictating our work orders to us.
Then, after we have
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#receive_guidance">double-checked the
received orders</a> with our sponsor or other group
elders, to make sure that they are good orders, we follow the orders.
We go do whatever the voices in our heads tell us to do.
Gee, and Frank Buchman dreamed that one up
without even any help from psychedelic drugs, which hadn't been
discovered yet. He really was ahead of his time.
<p>
And do you know what else is missing here? Humor. There is no lightness
or humor in any of that. It's all darkness, just Deacon Death droning on
and on about immorality, sin, defects of character, and soul-sickness.
Bill appears to have really had some soul-sickness.

<p>
So Bill now launches into his attack on human character.
He says that he is using a &quot;Universally recognized list of major
human failings &#8212; the Seven Deadly Sins.&quot; Actually, that is not a
universally-recognized list; it is specific to the Medieval
Roman Catholic Church. Members of other churches may object to the assumption.

<p>
And that list of sins is pretty perverted. Note that neither
cruelty nor murder is listed as a deadly sin, but sex, as lust, is.
Thus, a Nazi soldier could torture and murder thousands of Jews
without committing one of the Deadly Sins, as long as he laughed
while he did it, so that he wasn't &quot;Angry&quot;. And a Catholic
priest like Grand Inquisitor Torquemada could torture and execute
tens of thousands of women, girls, and baby girls for being
witches, men for being heretics or wizards, and Jews for being Jews,
without committing one of the Deadly Sins, either.
Convenient.
Personally, I would prefer an official church-approved list of
&quot;deadly sins&quot; that considers cruelty and murder worse than
gleefully making love with a wonderful woman.

<p>
But anyway, Bill says that Pride is the first sin. Pride leading to
self-justification, which, in combination with conscious or unconscious
fears, and making demands upon ourselves,
leads to perverting or misusing our God-given instincts,
which in turn leads to covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth.
Why, it's a regular old domino theory. And the ankle bone's connected
to the leg bone, and the leg bone's connected to the knee bone,
and the knee bone's connected to the thigh bone...
<p>
All of which is completely untrue. Period. That garbage is not true on any level,
not morally, or religiously, or psychologically, or medically, or biologically.
It is meaningless gibberish, just the deluded ranting and raving of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">a mentally ill man</a>.
Pride does not lead to any of what Bill says.
Pride does not lead to self-justification. Doing something wrong,
and then trying to rationalize it, is what leads to self-justification.
Pride does not lead to all of those other &quot;sins&quot;, either.
Bill wrote,
<font color="#5f008f">&quot;Pride lures us into making demands upon ourselves
or upon others which cannot be met without perverting or misusing
our God-given instincts.&quot;</font> That is insane, meaningless nonsense,
just a bunch of words strung together without any real logical or
rational meaning. It <i>sounds</i> like it means something, but if you
look closely, you will find that it is nonsense.

<p>
Note that Bill Wilson <i>did not</i> denounce <i>excessive</i>
pride, or false pride, or arrogant pride, or boastfulness; he just said &quot;pride&quot;.
<p>
In fact, there is nothing wrong with having some pride in yourself.
It is not a sin to pick your face up out of the mud and say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;I'm
good at what I do. I'm nice to other people. I don't have to be a doormat
and feel guilty about everything.&quot;
</font>
Bill thinks that is a big sin,
<font color="#5f008f"><i><b>The Mother Of All Sins</b></i></font>, in fact.
From Bill's point of view,
the real problem with having a little pride, or a little self-respect,
is that
if you still have some pride in your good qualities, then
you won't totally give up on yourself and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">surrender your will, your mind,
and your life to Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
<p>
So Bill wants to crush your pride, just like how he says he wants to
crush &quot;self-seeking&quot; in the Big Book. And just like how he
wants to crush
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#no_self_reliance" target="_blank">self-reliance</a>&quot;
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#dependency" target="_blank">make you dependent
upon Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

That is just Bill's contempt for you,</a> a product of his warped and
delusional mind. Period.
If you believe Bill's garbage, you're gonna get sick.
He will poison your mind with his hatred of humanity.

<p>
Bill Wilson even used the term &quot;warped&quot; to describe himself
and his fellow alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<font face="Times" size="-1">

</blockquote>
<p>

Bill thought that his natural desires had warped him. And
he thought that both his natural desires and instincts were evil things.
I'm telling you, that poor guy was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">quite insane</a>,
and you can't take his sermons seriously.
<p>

<a name="runwild">
Bill also said:</a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics especially should be able to see that instinct run wild
in themselves is the underlying cause of their destructive drinking.<br>

<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

No, I don't see that at all.
Bill is trying to induce contempt for human life by talking about
instincts run wild, and natural desires being bad.
He is trying to bring up images of some vicious savage wild animal,
out of control, snarling,
gnashing teeth, slobber all over the place... Again, all untrue.
<p>
He is also hinting at a
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Gnostic_heresy">Gnostic heresy</a>:
the idea that all goodness is in Heaven,
and everything down here on Earth is evil; all life is evil, and dirty,
and part of Satan's domain. In the Big Book, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Chapter 1, <i>Bill's Story</i>, page 11.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

The funny thing is, after he flipped out on belladonna, and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience">
saw the White Light
and &quot;the God of the preachers&quot;</a>, as he called it,
Bill Wilson just happily declared that everyone should have a spiritual experience.
But he obviously never stopped hating this world, and he never
stopped hating human nature.

<p>
And once again, what happened to the Disease Model of alcoholism? In the beginning,
to get us to join, they said that alcoholism was a progressive, incurable disease.
 They suggested that it was like an allergy, and that perhaps it was also genetic,
inherited from Father.  But then they pulled
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">a quick bait-and-switch stunt
on us, a &quot;medical-to-moral morph&quot;</a>,
and now they are saying that alcoholism is caused by The Seven Deadly Sins, and
natural desires warping us, and instincts running wild. And then
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Bob_selfish">Doctor Bob said</a>
that &quot;selfishness&quot; is the cause of alcoholism.
<p>
Nope, I'm not biting on that hook. This is obviously a big mind game, with you
and me as the intended victims. Bill and gang just want to make us feel guilty
and ashamed of ourselves, so that we will be more willing to
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender our wills and our lives to the cult</a>.

<a name="instincts2">
Freshman Biology</a> teaches us that
<a href="orange-definitions.html#instinct2">
instinctive behavior</a> is that behavior which is
ingrained in a species and cannot be changed. We humans have surprisingly
few instincts: We have the urge to eat food,
the urge to merge with the opposite sex,
the urge to care for our young, the urge to survive, and the urge to
socialize &#8212; to form relationships with a mate and other members of a tribe.
That's about it.
We have lots of tendencies, and lots of desires, but few instincts.
We seem to have largely replaced instincts with brains, and most of
what we do is learned behavior, rather than instinctive.
No way do our instincts &quot;run wild&quot; and cause us
to drink destructively.

Bill is confused about
<a href="orange-definitions.html#instinct2">instincts</a>
and desires. He gets them all mixed up.
He really should have taken at least one course in biology before he
decided to appoint himself the all-knowing, all-wise Guru.
In the long quote
above, he talks about &quot;God-given instincts,&quot;
which makes them sound okay.
But then he says they run wild and make us drink. Not so. Not even
vaguely true.
Instincts do not and cannot &quot;run wild.&quot;
<p>
Also, Bill says that we suffer from
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Unreasonable fear that
our instincts will not be satisfied.&quot;</font>
Wrong again. We satisfy desires, not instincts.
<p>
Likewise, Bill says,
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;When the satisfaction of our instincts for sex, security, and society
becomes the sole object of our lives, then pride steps in to justify
our excesses.&quot;</font>
<p>
Where did that come from? Bill was talking about pride being bad, and
then he suddenly accused us of having no goals in life but sex, security,
and society, and of pursuing those things to excess.
Which, actually, is a very strange, very bizarre, accusation.
Plenty of preachers denounce sex, but I don't
recall any other preachers criticizing people for wanting
<i>security and society</i>. (Isn't the church a society?)
And there is a strong implication there,
that you are evil because you are only seeking satisfaction of your own
desires &#8212; which Bill incorrectly calls <i>instincts</i>
again &#8212; rather than doing &quot;The Will of God&quot; (<i>as defined by
Bill Wilson, of course).</i>
<p>
Ironically, the people who seem to really want
&quot;security and society&quot;
most are the A.A. members. The rules of the A.A. game are, you have to go to
the meetings for the rest of your life, forever, and you can't ever
quit or leave.
That gives the A.A. members the secure feeling that the
meeting will always be there for them, that they can rest secure in
the knowledge that they will always have
that little piece of society, that familiar circle of
friends, forever. Few other &quot;fellowships&quot; or
social clubs say that you have to attend the meetings for the
rest of your life, or else you get a death sentence.
(Other than the Mafia...)

<p><br>
Let's look at an obvious instinct. At a certain time of the
year, a female bird gets an irresistible urge to build a nest.
So she starts grabbing sticks and weaving them into a nest.
That is instinct in action. The male bird decides to help out, and
grabs a stick and shoves it into the nest. The female immediately
jumps on it and says, &quot;No, no, no, that's all wrong.&quot; She rips the
stick out and shoves it back in, her way. She has a very specific
idea of just how that nest is going to be. It has to be <i><b>just so!</b></i>
That's instinct again.
The male watches, crestfallen, and then decides to go get another stick.
He comes back with one, and looks at the nest, and thinks, &quot;There,&quot;
and shoves it in.
The female immediately jumps on it and says, &quot;No, no, no,
that's all wrong,&quot;
and rips it out, and shoves it in her way, again.
<p>
I watched those two repeat that routine until I was laughing.
The poor guy just couldn't do anything right.
<p>
Now that is instinct. They are just doing their thing. No way can
such instinct &quot;run wild.&quot; What's she going to do, go crazy
and build twenty nests? Actually, those birds were already wild, they had
always been wild, and so were their instincts, I guess.
And there is no &quot;unreasonable fear that
their instincts will not be satisfied.&quot; They are just following
their urges to do what they are supposed to do. And the system works.
The nest works, the eggs hatch, the baby birds live, and life goes on.
<p>
<a name="grammar_ret"> </a>
Lest you think that the bird example is too far removed from human
behavior, let me tell you that it isn't. My wife turned into the same kind
of compulsive mother bird when she was pregnant. She was actually waking
up in the middle of the night, saying that she had a dream that the
baby had been born, and we didn't have enough blankets or diapers,
so we had better get more. We had enough, but she was worried anyway.
Then she was worried about us not having enough firewood, and then she
was worried about us not having enough food.
I'm not joking. She was like that. A fussy nest-building mother bird,
worrying that the nest wasn't <a href="#grammar">perfect enough</a>.
That's the instinct to care for the young expressing itself.
Sometimes it seems pretty extreme, but it keeps the babies alive.
In no way is it &quot;instinct run wild.&quot;
<p>
But Bill, alas, doesn't understand that at all. He has this idea
that instincts are horrible things.
<p>
Now her worrying about the welfare of the baby that was soon to be born
almost sounds like what Bill was talking about,
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Unreasonable fear that our instincts will not be satisfied.&quot;
</font>
But it isn't.
Being concerned about the welfare of a baby is definitely not
&quot;unreasonable fear&quot; or
&quot;instinct run wild&quot;.

And it sure isn't the destructive force that Bill described
in the long quote above, where Bill said that such
&quot;unreasonable fear&quot; would lead to
all of the other Deadly Sins, even Sloth, and make us into horrible creatures.
No way.
It's just a fussy mother bird, wanting her nest to be perfect, so that
she can take good care of her babies.
<p>

<!--
(Speaking of which, I can't help but notice that Mrs. Wilson never got
pregnant. I don't have any new facts to offer there; I don't know if she
had a medical condition or something;
I just wonder whether Bill's hatred of &quot;instincts
run wild&quot; had anything to do with Lois never having any babies.
Although, I must add that apparently Bill wasn't totally opposed to
instincts run wild, because he ended up keeping a mistress on the
side, to whom he gave one-tenth of Lois's inheritance. She wasn't
too happy about that. Lois, I mean.)
-->

<p>

And then Bill says,
<font color="#5f008f">
<b>&quot;We want to find exactly how, when, and where,
our natural desires have warped us.&quot;</b>
</font>
Nonsense. We have not been warped by our
natural desires. Period.
<p>
There is simply nothing wrong with our natural desires.
If we didn't eat, we would die. If we didn't have sex and reproduce, we would
become extinct. If we didn't feel rage and anger when threatened,
or when our children are threatened, the saber-toothed
tigers would have eaten us all long ago.
We happily feast like gluttons when food is available
because it's going to be a long, cold, hard winter to endure,
with little or no food available.
Likewise, we have enough <b>selfishness</b> to make us seek
our own survival, and enough <b>selflessness</b> to make us help our
fellow tribe members also survive. We work hard when we need to,
and goof off when it's convenient. We really aren't all that bad.
Nothing in us warrants Bill Wilson's hatred of human nature.
No wonder the poor bastard drank.
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">He was a real sicko.</a>

<p>
<a name="ftnt04_ret"> </a>
Bill's parents obviously really messed up his mind.
Something that the A.A. literature
doesn't like to mention very often is the fact that Bill Wilson was the abused
son of an alcoholic father, and that alcohol destroyed his family when
he was young, which made him an <i>untreated</i> Adult Child Of
an Alcoholic (ACOA).
Bill's father abandoned the family when Bill was still just a boy,
and Bill's mother had serious mental problems of her own &#8212;
she ended up in a mental institution later in life, and she may well have
actually driven Bill's father from the house.
The official A.A. history book <i>PASS IT ON</i> tells us that Bill's mother
was strong-willed and cold &#8212; she &quot;lacked the warmth and understanding
that might have stood her son in good stead at such a difficult time [the divorce].&quot;
that.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>
Bill Wilson said:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;My mother was a disciplinarian, and I can remember the agony of hostility

<a name="ftnt05_ret"> </a>
In addition, Bill lived with his grandparents after his parents divorced
in 1906, and his mother moved to Boston to continue her studies in osteopathy.

Obviously, Bill's parents and grandparents shamed him and berated him
for his natural desires, and taught him a Puritan contempt for nature
and for life.
In 1909, Bill was sent to The
Burr &amp; Burton Seminary, a private school in Manchester, Vermont.
Then Bill's teenage girlfriend at Burr &amp; Burton,
with whom he was very much in love,
died suddenly from complications following an
operation for a brain tumor,
and it affected Bill deeply &#8212; he went into a three-year-long depression,
and failed to even graduate from high
school.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt05">5</a></sup></font>
Then, of course, Bill later turned into a raging alcoholic, and displayed
all of the symptoms of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic">narcissistic personality disorder</a> and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">delusions of grandeur</a>.
And then Bill suffered from severe, prolonged, bouts of deep crippling
chronic depression for most of his life. (His last period of depression
lasted for 11 years, from 1944 to 1955.)
It is difficult to say exactly who did what to Bill, but together,
they induced in Bill an insanity from which he never recovered.
And now he wants to do the same thing to us. No thanks.

<p>
Well, to finish on a positive note, we aren't that sick, and we don't have to
follow in Bill Wilson's footsteps.
We can do much better things, more fun and enjoyable things, with our lives.
<p>
Don't buy the stereotypes. Don't buy into the game when someone starts talking
about &quot;us stupid drunks, we are all like this or all like that.&quot;
Wake up and smell the coffee, and realize that they are trying to pull
a fast one on you, and confuse you about who you really are.
They are trying to kill off what little self-confidence or self-respect
you might have left. Don't let them do it to you.

In the back of my mind, I'm hearing someone ask, &quot;Well, if it wasn't
our desires warping us, why did we drink destructively? Isn't it
insanity to drink until you are so sick that you are dying?&quot;
And, obviously, the same goes for taking drugs until you die,
or smoking cigarettes until you can't breathe.
<p>
Fair question.

Some of Bill Wilson's apocryphal stories about A.A. are:
<ul>
<li> The story of chosing good over evil in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel in Akron, Ohio,
in the spring of 1935, is
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Mayflower">a fabrication that is physically impossible</a>.
Bill told a story about being torn between going into the bar at one end of the hall, or
telephoning a church from the pay phone at the other end of the hall, but the bar and
the public telephone were actually on different floors of the hotel.
<li> Likewise, Bill's story about telephoning Rev. Tunks from the Mayflower Hotel just by chance,
and luckily finding a fellow member of the Oxford Group religion was
another deception. That event was not a miracle or divine providence, or even
a coincidence.
Rev. Tunks was the most hard-core Oxford Group cult member in Akron,
and New York Oxford Group members almost certainly told Bill to call Rev. Tunks while he
was in Akron.
 Bill Wilson's mentor in New York City, Rev. Samuel Shoemaker, was the man
who &quot;changed&quot; Rev. Tunks into an Oxford Group member, so Shoemaker knew all
about Rev. Tunks. It is highly likely the Shoemaker told Bill Wilson to call Rev. Tunks
and to attend Oxford Group meetings while he was in Akron.

<li> The financing and writing of the <i>Big Book</i> was not
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">as Bill described</a> it in
his book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age&quot;.
<li> Bill Wilson grandly boasted about
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100">the First One Hundred</a>&quot;
when there were only 40 A.A. members.
<li> Likewise, Bill wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that
<a href="orange-letters14.html#original_success">A.A. had saved &quot;hundreds&quot;</a>
when there were actually only between 40 and 70 A.A. members in the whole world,
and they didn't stay sober.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses" target="_blank">Fully half of the orginal authors of the <i>Big Book</i> relapsed
and returned to drinking</a>.

<li> Bill Wilson wrote in the Big Book that he was a faithful husband to his wife when he was really
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">a shameless philanderer</a> who used A.A. meetings as meat markets.
<li> Bill described
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#bet_your_ass">the tyrannical child-abusing Dr. Robert Smith</a>
as a kindly old soul, which he wasn't.
<li> Bill described his wife Lois as
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Lois_rem">a happy housewife, content to
work in a department store and support him</a>
while he goofed off and went to A.A. meetings, when in truth she was
bitterly unhappy, screaming,
&quot;<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#old_meetings">Damn your old meetings!</a>&quot;
<li> Bill Wilson lied about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">the early A.A. success rate</a>.
Bill also lied when he claimed that his new cult was much better at treating alcoholics than
were all of the doctors, ministers, priests, and psychiatrists who tried to help alcoholics.
<li>
Bill Wilson lied when he declared that
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#woman_stay">Marty Mann was the first woman A.A. member</a>.
No, she wasn't, Marty Mann was at least the third woman, or later.
The first woman to become sober in A.A. was
Jane Sturdevant. The second woman in A.A. was Florence Rankin, who wrote the story
<b><i>&quot;A Feminine Victory&quot;</i></b>,
which appeared in the first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>.
Unfortunately, the Twelve Steps didn't really work for her, either,
for very long. She relapsed, and disappeared. (She is said to have
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#Florence_Rankin_suicide">committed suicide</a>
in Washington, D.C.) So Bill changed the story and started bragging
about Marty Mann being the first woman member of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<li> Bill Wilson claimed to be a stock broker when he was merely a Wall Street hustler
who touted stocks to speculators. Likewise, Bill's boosters brag that Bill invented the
art of stock market analysis in the 1920s, as if Charles Dow didn't create
the Dow-Jones Industrial Average and start publishing it in the Wall Street Journal
around the turn of the century.

This is one of the most insane and vicious books around.
It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and 
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book">hate content</a>, is concerned.
It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's
explanation of his Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, but it
is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness">something quite
dark and evil</a>, Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for
human nature masquerading as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book">all of his own
weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,
<font color="#5f008f">&quot;Look at him.
Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>
This whole book is non-stop guilt induction.

This is the official, council-approved version of the history
of A.A.. Strangely enough, there is some very interesting stuff
in here, including chapter 16, which describes
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">Bill's spook sessions
and s&eacute;ances</a>, talking with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Nantucket">the spirits
of the dead</a>, and communicating
with spirits through spirit rapping and the Ouija board. See pages 275

This is just the usual 12-Step dogma, cut and pasted by a paper shredder.
&#8212; By that I mean, there is not a single new, different, creative, or
original thought in the whole book; it's just
<a href="#Gorski1">the same old stuff</a>, slightly rearranged.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What is curious is the fact that three years after he published
this book, Terence Gorski
quite perceptively denounced the entire Adult Children of Alcoholics
and co-dependency 12-Step movement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In 1992, Terence Gorski, a prominent spokesperson within the field of addictions, addressing a conference of the
National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, stated: 
<blockquote>
If I were hired by the enemies of the chemical dependency field ... I couldn't give them a better strategy [to destroy
the field] than the adult children of alcoholics movement and the codependency movement. When we as a field
expanded addictions to include all compulsive disorders we destroyed our constituency base ... destroyed our
funding base ... destroyed our economic stability.<br>

<i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alexander Lowen, M.D.<br>
Macmillan Publishing Comany, New York, 1983, and<br>
Collier Macmillan Publishers, London, 1983.<br>
ISBN: 0-02-575890-X<br>
LC: RC553.N36L38 1983<br>
LCCN: 83-18794<br>
This is a great book, a real classic. Dr. Lowen advances the idea that
narcissism is not falling in love with one's self, but rather with a
false image of one's self. That small subtle difference actually makes
a very large difference. In the original Greek mythology, Narcissus died
&#8212; starved to death &#8212; because he was obsessed with his own image and
stared at it endlessly.
But as Narcissus approached death, his real emaciated appearance could not have
been very attractive. Narcissus was seeing an illusion, not his true
appearance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Lowen advances the idea that narcissism is often caused
by child abuse and prolonged humiliation and pain in childhood. The child
adopts a persona where he feels no pain and is powerful and invulnerable.
The child thinks, <i>&quot;When I grow up, I'll be so powerful and strong that no
one can hurt me or humiliate me ever again.&quot;</i> Then the child, who grows into
adulthood, spends the rest of his life pursuing and defending an illusion.
Narcissists are obsessed with defending and preserving their image &#8212; they can't
stand it if somebody &quot;makes them look bad&quot; &#8212; they can't stand criticism.
They deny their true feelings and put on a mask of unfeeling, because
they imagine that it will keep them from being hurt again.
Likewise, they completely disregard other people's feelings.
They are obsessed with power and control, so that they can
control the world around them and prevent anyone from humiliating
them again.
Narcissists are often extremely seductive and manipulative people, often charismatic
charmers, and occasionally high achievers as well.
They lie habitually, without giving it a second thought.
They fear insanity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, Dr. Lowen was describing
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic">Bill Wilson</a>, the
abused son of an alcoholic father and a neurotic mother.

<i>Loving the Self-Absorbed: How to Create a More Satisfying Relationship with a
Narcissistic Partner</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Nina W. Brown, Ed.D., LPC, NCC<br>
New Harbinger Publications, Inc., Oakland, CA, 2003.<br>
ISBN: 1-57224-354-6<br>
Dewey: 158.2 B879L<br>
This book tells you how to cope with being married to an obnoxious narcissist.
The one thing I couldn't see was, &quot;Why bother?&quot; Nina Brown makes narcissists
sound so bad that you really don't want to be married to one. But if you are
some kind of long-suffering masochist who really wants to go through it all,
read this book.<br>
