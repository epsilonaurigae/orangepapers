Hi

<p>
I intend to agree with what you have to say, i have been in the fellowship for a
long time now and it seems to be getting worse instead of better. If i had of known
what i was coming into i would have walked straight back out again.
<p>
At the start i so much wanted to stop drinking and i thank god i dont have that
desire anymore, but what pisses me off is the so-called spiritual aa know-alls that
know f--- all that judge, they ask how many meetings do you do a week, i can
sponsor you. &quot;I never asked for one &#8212; piss off&quot;,,,,, and they
say that is just your
ego, or your alcoholisim, blah blah blah, everything is analysed.....

<p>
I'm sick and tired of it all, so i am deciding to move away from it all, i trust and
believe in myself, i dont need these sick b--------- around me anymore, they say
they are your friend but the minute you choose to go another path they don't want to
know you, they call that spirituality, i call it control and they are all control
freaks...
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michele,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer it; I'm way behind on
answering email. I hope that by now you are free and feeling better.
<p>
Yes, it is incredible what gets passed off as spirituality, isn't it?
And it isn't just A.A.; the same bad behavior goes on in a zillion cult religions &#8212; 
like the Moonies, and Scientology, and the Hari Krishnas, and the FLDS, and
on and on...

Hi Doug,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
The .ORG suffix was easy &#8212; just ask for it.
There are no longer any hard rules where you have to be a registered non-profit
to get a .ORG suffix.
<p>
I chose .ORG because .COM wasn't appropriate &#8212; I'm not running a commercial
enterprise. And I'm not a university, so .EDU is out. And I'm not the government,
so .GOV is out. So .ORG was pretty much the default.

HH His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso The Dalai Lama would surely be compassionate towards
you despite your efforts at charactor assassination. I , sober these 27 years
because of the imposters who started AA wish I could feel the same compassion but I
am not so highly evolved

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't engage in &quot;character assassination&quot;. I just tell the truth, including the
truth about some nasty reprobates who started cults.
<p>
Your belief that you are sober because of A.A. is not evidence that A.A. actually
works, or that you are sober because of A.A.
The reality is that A.A. does not work, and the people who quit drinking
in A.A. are just the ones who were going to quit anyway.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Every time A.A. has been put to the test,
it failed</a>. When a Trustee of A.A. tried to prove that A.A. works,
he accidentally proved that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. has the highest death rate</a>
of any way of treating alcoholism that he studied.
<p>
Since you have been around A.A. for 27 years, you are a good one to ask:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?

Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year

How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>

That's good. So do you practice that wisdom by unfailingly telling the truth about
Alcoholics Anonymous to the newcomers? Do you speak up and tell the truth
at the start of each meeting when confused people start to read the

60 of the <i>Big Book</i>.)

Subject:  	No AA thailand<br>

<p>
I love your site, even though I still go to AA.
I guess I'm an AA insider rebel, and I say whatever to whoever,  whenever,
but I have friends there also.

<p>
Anyway, I moved to Thailand, and found plenty of English speaking and other
foreign speaking
AA meetings.  When I asked about Thai AA, they had one meeting in the
country for 60 million people.
Hmmm. my little town there of about 5,000 expats had 23 meetings a  week.

<p>
So of course we got to work printing AA thai literature and bringing it to
hospitals, etc.
Bottom line they wanted the BB reprinted because they don't do God,   They do
Sacred Being.
Now there's problem with world service [AAWS], because they may not allow that
printing.

<p>
Also the fact is  they have about a 30 to 50% recovery rate without  AA.  A
lot of these people live
in very rural villages and no transportation.. They go to the local temple
or get help from friends.
They really do NOT like AA, and have never embraced it, and the only reason
Thai AA meetings
even exist now, is because some of the foreign AAs pay to get them to the
meetings, and help set
up the meetings, and they are NOT self supporting, and eventually it will
die on the vine.

<p>
<a name="laugh"> </a>
AA is so worldwide, it may not die out, because as you said the social
value,
but I sure would like some way of getting more people to see about Bill  W.
When i tell people in
meetings that Bill Wilson died of nicotine addiction which does not sound
too spiritual  (most are shocked)
and the womanizing thing, they just laugh about it.   Ok....  enough.

<p>
peace and Love,<br>
Eddie
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Eddie,
<p>
Thanks for an intriguing letter.
They get a 30 to 50% recovery rate without A.A.?
Maybe all of us alcoholics should convert to Buddhism... :-)
<p>
So the A.A. supporters have to pay to
promote A.A. in Thailand? That doesn't surprise me.
The sort of conflicts with
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11">the A.A. &quot;tradition&quot;</a>
about
&quot;a program of attraction, not promotion&quot;, doesn't it?

And it directly contradicts Bill's bragging about the universality of
his &quot;spiritual principles&quot;:
<p>
In his official history of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill claimed that he
received this letter from a Presbyterian minister who was doing missionary work
in the Far East:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We took A.A.'s Twelve Steps over to the largest Buddhist monastery
in this province. We showed them to the priest at the head of it.
After he had finished looking over the Twelve Steps, the monk said,
&quot;Why, these are fine! Since we as Buddhists don't understand
God just as you do, it might be slightly more acceptable if you
inserted the word 'good' in your Steps instead of 'God.' Nevertheless,
you say in these Steps that it is God <i>as you understand Him</i>.
That clears up the point for us. Yes, A.A.'s Twelve Steps will
certainly be accepted by the Buddhists around here.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson,
page 81.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I have to laugh.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
By the way, if you print your own translation of an out-of-copyright earlier
edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, the A.A.W.S. headquarters cannot forbid that.
They may grumble, and even fraudulently sue and commit perjury, like
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">they did in Germany</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#AAWS_perjury">Mexico</a>, 
but legally they have no say in the matter. Out-of-copyright
documents are in the public domain. That's why those of us who are in the USA
can download old copies of the <i>Big Book</i> over the Internet for free.
The A.A. headquarters does not dare to sue over that, because if they do, it will
result in the <i>Big Book</i> being legally declared out of copyright,
which then blows away all of the foreign copyrights that depend on the
USA copyright.
<p>
Have another good day.

Subject: <a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a> by A. Orange<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange
<p>
I scanned through your writing on Alcoholics Anonymous and have mixed
opinions.<br>
Yes we all have opinions and it is not up to me to &quot;judge &quot; yours.
Although I am wondering what alternative you would have for a suffering
alcoholic .<br>
In the past 45 years I have crossed paths with 1000's of recovered
alcoholics who's
lives and families have been restored as well as some that have not been
restored.<br>
I can say the same about those families I meet who attend a church of their
choice (doctrine).

<p>
I noticed you seemed , for what ever reason , missed out on A.A. purpose....
we do not wish to engage in any controversy neither do we endorse or oppose
any causes. The primary purpose is to stay sober and help other recover.
It's about saving skins . Yes a personal experience with Yeshua is exactly
that .... a personal experience . I have crossed paths with many in A.A.
over the decades who have had this experience as well as some don't have
that experience . I have observed this also in churches.
I am sorry that you seem to need to be critical of a group of people that
have been given a second chance at life cuz most of them would be dead if
they didn't get turned around.
<p>
Myself , in 1963 , a back slidden christian voiced the words in
desparation ..... God if their is a God , your will be done in my life. Yes
He is &quot;faithful and just to forgive all those that repent&quot; ( turn around ) .
Patti and I are retired and having our 47 wedding aniversary in a few months
. Our 2 childern are now adults. We have grand children &amp; great grand
children .... all are healthy and blessed. It all started when believers
prayed through for me when I was not into seeing any truths. Seems  when God
puts it on one heart  to pray , something is born .... most things are
wrought by prayer, wouldnt you say .  A week after I hollered  help seems
God saw fit to introduce me to a bunch of sober drunks that were capable of
loving me enough until I could start loving myself. I discovered He  meets
me on my own turf ..... didn't Paul use it .... when they were weak He was
weak. I'm not sure your kind understands the language from the heart.
At that time I began to find out some truths that started setting me free. I
am being blessed daily with the opportunity to be a friend of some that are
having a little more trouble then the rest of us.....and I don't need to
force-feed them . Some of them are looking much healthier then they once did
and yes there is resoration in their lives.
<p>
Like I said when I started this note .... I can't see where you are
helping any one by the tone of your writings. My prayers are that God will
humble you cuz in a different light I can see where a person of your calibre
has much to offer.

<p>
My personal opinion and experience with A.A. for the part 45 years can be
expressed in one Greek word ..... koinania . First century Christianity had
it. I found koinania to be almost absent in most churches although I do find
it's present in a few assembly of believers.

Hello Jack,
<p>
First off, you assume that A.A. actually works and makes alcoholics quit drinking and
stay quit. There is no evidence &#8212; zero evidence &#8212; that A.A. really does that.
You talk about having seen thousands of people who once drank too much alcohol
and now don't. That's good. That is evidence that some people finally get their
act together and quit self-destructive behavior.
But that isn't evidence that A.A. actually did anything for them.
<p>
Every time A.A. has been tested to see if it works or does anything good,
A.A. failed. Failed badly. Like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">increased the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">increased the death rate in alcoholics</a>.

<p>
To claim that A.A. is too spiritual to engage in controversy is a cop-out.
A really big cop-out. You have groups like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the Midtown Group raping young girls</a>
and you are too &quot;spiritual&quot; to do anything about it, or put a stop to it.
That is not spirituality. That is moral cowardice.
<p>
If you were really spiritual, you would act like Jesus Christ when he picked up a whip
and drove the thieving money-changers from the temple.
It's time for you A.A. true believers to clean house. But you aren't going
to do it, are you? You will sit on your duffs until the name of A.A. is
so totally besmirched that nobody dares to go there any more.
<p>
Oh well, maybe that is really for the best. Maybe you are doing the
world a favor by letting the rapists and criminals destroy A.A.
It's time for A.A. to die, and something better to replace it.

<p>
Dear Sir,

<p>
I have just stumbled upon your pages with some interest. I am just coming up
to one year of sobriety, using AA, and using it, I feel, in a thinking,
non-slavish fashion, free of any of the fetishistic qualities that one
encounters. I simply find contact with other people in recovery to be
cheering and helpful.

<p>
I will try to read your material further, but have stumbled at the start. At
the foot of your introduction you write: &quot;So let's really, honestly,
investigate Alcoholics Anonymous, without rejecting criticism of A.A. before
investigation of all of the facts... &quot;

<p>
So...I move to the next section, The 12 Biggest Secrets of AA, to find the
statement:

<p>
&quot;Twelve Steps do 
not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.&quot;<br>
&lt;http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html&gt;
<p>
Surely, by using this statement as your opening salvo, you have done exactly
what you vowed not to do in your introduction &#8212; you have rejected and
criticized AA prior to investigation. The statement that Twelve Steps do no
work would surely have been written in conclusion had you adhered to your
own statement of intent. Instead the statement appears prior to any
investigative, supportive, or explanatory material. I do not contest that
such material may appear further down the page &#8212; my point, I repeat, is that
your damning verdict precedes it.

<p>
A brief glance also reveals your reference to 'mandatory' AA and NA
meetings. There are no such things. It may well be that your attendance was
deemed mandatory by an outside organisation rather than AA itself; that is
an entirely different thing! To my knowledge no actual meetings themselves
could not be described as mandatory.

<p>
Yours sincerely,

<p>

Hello Charlie,
<p>
I wrote this line:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
&quot;Twelve Steps do 
not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.&quot;</a><br>
<b><i>after</i></b> I had spent a couple of years investigating A.A.,
and collecting all of the valid controlled studies of A.A. treatment of alcoholism
that were ever done, and writing the
file on <i>The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</i> that the statement linked
to.
It most assuredly was not &quot;contempt prior to investigation&quot;.
It was <i>contempt after thorough investigation</i>.
And the contempt is well-deserved. It is a really low, despicable crime to
foist quack medicine on sick people, and lie to them about how well it works, or
doesn't work.
<p>
To argue that it is &quot;contempt prior to investigation&quot; because of
the positioning of some items on the page is absurd. That's really desperately
reaching for something to complain about.

<p>
You think there is no such thing as mandatory A.A. meetings?
You are just engaging in word games.
Go to any drug court or traffic court and
<a href="orange-sentenced">watch the judge sentencing people to A.A. meetings</a>.
(Or sentencing people to &quot;treatment programs&quot;, which
include a whole lot of mandatory A.A. meetings.)
<p>
And please don't tell me that A.A. doesn't encourage it.

Subject:  	recovery exit strategy<br>

<p>
Dear mr. Orange:

<p>
I drank heavily after my father and my first wife died.   After a year, I quit.
Then, I went AA for a while.   And, to SMART online &#8212; no face to face meetings

<p>
AA left me cold; basically turned me off. It had nothing to do with what I did or
did not do.  It meant nothing to me.  After reading about it, I know why.

<p>
SMART was useful; the tools were good; the message board and chat room were good.
For a while.   I guess that it was time to leave.

<p>
I think that there is a time to leave. I worked through my grief; sorted out my
priorities; did what I needed to do &#8212; get married again, move 1300 miles.
I was not an &quot;alcoholic&quot;.  I did not actually have that serious a drinking problem.

<p>
There seems to be a doctrine of: you can't do it on your own.   And, abstain is the
only way.
That does seem an undercurrent in the recovery game.

<p>
Well, I did it on my own; I do not abstain.   I am living a normal life.

<p>
I bet that many people pay a visit to the recovery world &#8212; aa or some other place
 &#8212; and say, NO &#8212; and do it on their own.

<p>
I think that there is something off kilter.

<p>
It took me a long time to find you on the web.  I am dealing with a young
client who I believe has been traumatized by residential 12-step treatment.
I've been fascinated and amazed by your material, and am sharing some with
him &#8212; especially the jokes &#8212;  in the hope that he will get some solace from
it.  I've had warm-fuzzy feelings about AA for 30 years, but no longer.  I
fell for a lot of this stuff myself when I was younger (it seems smart
people can make themselves very stupid), and I can easily see how seriously
damaging it can be to others (especially in a coercive setting like
residential youth facilities).  Thank you for doing what you do.  If you
have any suggestions for helping a young person get through a rough period
(still getting into some trouble, threatened with more 12-step &quot;treatment,&quot;
etc.) I'd be grateful.

Hello Lesley,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I'm sorry to take
so long to answer it; I'm way behind in answering email.
<p>
I hope your young client is doing well. You make me wish I were a psychologist or
a therapist, which I'm not.
<p>
Something that I do feel qualified to talk about is anger, because I still have
problems with it. I'm 62 years old and I still have anger issues over childhood
abuse.  So I suspect that I can feel a little of what your client feels.
<p>
I still have to work on letting go of anger. I know that keeping it does me
no good; it just gets me all uptight and wastes my energy.
I ran across a relevant quote recently:
<p>
<blockquote>
Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the
 intent of throwing it at someone else;
  you are the one who gets burned.<br>
  == Buddha
</blockquote>
<p>
It's easy to feel entitled to be angry, and he is entitled to be angry, but
it does no good, and isn't worth the bother.

<p>
Perhaps some
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709035638/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>
training might help. They teach techniques for
recognizing irrational thoughts and assumptions, and dealing with them.
SMART is good for learning how to stop driving yourself crazy.
<p>
Have a good day.

do you have against the AA program?
<p>
Personally, I am in the midst of quitting alcohol, and AA is the thing that's
getting me through the day. Maybe just because it didn't work for you or you think
it's a weird &quot;cult&quot;, doesn't mean it's a hoax. It really works for other people, me
included. So please stop thinking of yourself as an educator or have some higher
knowledge. You don't obviously.

Hello Carol,
<p>
What do I have against A.A.? Well, how about the fact that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">it doesn't work</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">they lie about that fact</a>
at the start of every meeting.
And then they harm a lot of people with misinformation about alcoholism
and recovery, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raise the death rate

<p>
It's sad that you cannot come up with a better attack than the usual
often-parrotted A.A. claim that &quot;Maybe just because it didn't work for you...&quot;

As I have often said, &quot;I never did the 12 Steps, I never had a sponsor, and I

Hi Mr. Orange,

<p>
Thank you for your work. I am currently going to AA to pacify my estranged
wife and gain the right to see my little girl again. The wife has a
restraining order against me, is a compulsive liar, and is a prescription
amphetamine addict (adderall for ADD). She is a long way away from
admitting that she has a problem, because her shrink/society/family tell
her that she is defective and needs adderall to get to the level of
others. She is really just spoiled (filthy rich family), weak willed, and
lazy. Long story.

<p>
Anyway, I quickly took issue with &quot;step 1&quot;, as I feel I am not powerless,
but powerfull, and responsible for and capable of changing my behavior. At
the end of AA meetings, someone signs my paper saying I was there, and
that's that. I started reading some Tom Wolfe over the weekend (a lot of
stuff attacking genetic pre-disposition), and I was reminded that I am
responsible for my actions, I can change, and I have no excuse. Lincoln
said something like &quot;Mans purpose is to improve himself&quot;, or something
like that. Much of you data about &quot;spontaneous remission&quot; really made me
feel empowered.
<p>
Thanks again,

Yes, you've got it. That A.A. &quot;powerless&quot; doctine

messed up by that abdication of personal responsibility, and that

over alcohol tend to fail when they try to quit drinking. It's a self-fulfilling
prophesy.

Sometimes they do, like

</font>
<p>
Now on to another subject. I have noticed a trend in the last few years among some
of the AAers that I work with. They are a lot more secretitve about where the
meetings are and they tend to hide the fact that they are in AA. These are people
that used to wear the latest conference t-shirts, had the coffee cups with the
triangle logo, and the bumper stickers (which they have taken off their cars). What
happened, is that some of the mandatory treatment centers and/or alcohol/drug
counseling that is mandated by court are not requiring AA attendance. There are a
few alternative programs that have been offered in the last few years. Evidently
some big disagreement happened between AA/NA and treatment centers arose in the SW
Missouri and NW Arkansas areas and some people involved in the treatment industry
really got pissed. What I have pieced together was that some of the groups were
trying to say that if someone was on Rx drugs and/or went to therapy or
counseling, that they were not working the program or that they were not clean and
sober. Those old timers need to read their own book instead of quoting it!

<p>
There was some things that I did agree with in the book, like not evading your
creditors and seeking outside help for the mental and emotional problems that come
up after quiting drugs and alcohol.

<p>
Any way, thanks for keeping this site going.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the thanks.  Now that story is interesting. I'd definitely like to
hear the gory details of an internal dispute in the treatment industry.
And it's way past time for the treatment industry to notice that A.A. is really
hurting a lot of people by telling them not to take their medications.
Even causing deaths.
<p>
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
The A.A. web site actually acknowledges that
A.A. members have pushed newcomers into suicide by telling them not to take
their medications.
Their conference-approved pamphlet, &quot;The AA Member &#8212; Medications &amp; Other
Drugs&quot;, on page 13 states
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Because of the difficulties that many alcoholics
have with drugs, some members have taken the
position that no one in A.A. should take any medication.
While this position has undoubtedly prevented
relapses for some, it has meant disaster for others.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
AA members and many of their physicians have described
situations in which depressed patients have been told by AAs to throw away the
pills, only to have the depression return with all of its difficulties, sometimes
resulting in suicide.

We have heard, too, from schizophrenics, manic
depressives, epileptics, and others requiring
medication that well-meaning A.A. friends often
discourage them from taking prescribed medication.
Unfortunately, by following a layman's
advice, the sufferers find that their conditions
can return with all their previous intensity. On
top of that, they feel guilty because they are
convinced that &quot;A.A. is against pills.&quot;

</blockquote>


<p>
So I wonder what was going on in Missouri and Arkansas.
<p>
I'd also like to see the A.A. headquarters be a little more specific about how
many deaths &quot;sometimes&quot; means when they say,
&quot;sometimes resulting in suicide.&quot;
<p>
And of course the above wishy-washing back-and-forth apologetic quote begs the question,
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So which A.A. members, old-timers, or sponsors are entitled to decide whether
<ol>
<li> the newcomer <i>should not</i> take medications,
in order to &quot;undoubtedly prevent relapse&quot;, or
<li> the newcomer <i>should</i> take medications, in order to prevent death?
</ol>

So who decides? Who has the knowledge and the power?

Subject: <a href="orange-aalies.html">Your 12 &quot;Lies&quot; of AA</a><br>

<p>
Sir:
<p>
I do not wish to get into a debate, however, you are mistaken in thinking
that the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are about quitting drinking.  They
are about learning to live life.  Myself as a recovered alcoholic quit
drinking the day I came into AA and said I need help.  Alcoholics Anonymous
also is not a religious program.  It is spiritual.  And please read this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS is a fellowship of men and women who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their
common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only
requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues
or fees for A.A. Membership; we are self-supporting through our own
contributions. A.A. Is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics,
organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy;
neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay
sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are not a sect, or a weird religion, or even a cult as you have said.  We
are a fellowship.  And I know this much from personal experience:  &quot;It works
&quot;
<p>
Each member is allowed to develop their own concept of God or a Higher Power
If it were a religious program, it would have faltered and failed very
early in its birth.  It is my personal opinion that your paper on Alcoholics
Anonymous is very one-sided, and is filled with pre-conceived and completely
inaccurate notions.  Some of your &quot;facts&quot; as alluded to in your paper are,
in my opinion, completely false.  You seem to want to bend the facts to meet
your distorted views.  Other statements made by you are simply a result of
ignorance.  Ignorance is not bad, however.  One can always be educated on
the proper facts.  Alcoholics Anonymous has saved many people that modern
medicine has labeled hopeless and without recourse.  I know this for I am
one of those people and I have been witness with my own eyes to the recovery
of countless others.
<a name="disservice3"> </a>
  Your ill-thought words have the potential to be very
damaging.  NOT to the program of Alcoholics Anonymous, but to an individual
who may be searching for the solution to his or her problems.
<p>
If you have gathered your &quot;facts&quot; from other web sites and people who are at
odds with Alcoholics Anonymous, I invite you to attend any open AA meeting
near your home so that you may learn more about our fellowship.  There are
many people in AA who are very informed on the workings and history of AA.
You may find that AA is nothing like how you described it in your paper.
<p>
<a name="Joe_Charlie"> </a>
I also urge you to download and just listen to any Joe and Charlie sessions on
the AA program.  They are free at www.silkworth.net.  We invite any and all
who may be seeking help or are merely curious.  If, on the other hand, you
have had intimate contact with the program of AA recently or previously in
your life, and you are still unable to grasp the spiritual concept as
outlined in the Big Book of AA and the 12 Steps, I invite you back into the
Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous with open arms.  We will be here when you
are ready.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Brian D. H.

<font color="blue">

Hello Brian,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
When you declare,
<font color="black">
&quot;...you are mistaken in thinking
that the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are about quitting drinking&quot;</font>,
you are supporting what I have been saying all along &#8212; that
the A.A. 12-Step program is not
a quit-drinking program &#8212; it is cult religion.
<p>
The 12 Steps don't even say that you should quit drinking.
They are all about you being insane and sinful and needing to surrender to
some &quot;Higher Power as you understand Him&quot;.
The 12 Steps are nothing more than
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Bill Wilson's repackaging of Dr. Frank
Buchman's cult religion recruiting and indoctrination practices</a>.
So yes, the 12 Steps are not about quitting drinking. They have nothing whatsoever
to do with sobriety or quitting drinking.
But they have everything to do with cult religion.

<p>
Then the rest of your letter makes a good case for A.A. being a cult religion.
Even your declarations that A.A. is not a cult religion are good evidence of that.

<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
And then of course you just had to insert the standard A.A. cult attack on critics:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Your ill-thought words have the potential to be very damaging.&quot;</font>
<p>
I can't count how many times I've heard the A.A. true believers parrot that accusation,
as if telling the truth about alcoholism and Alcoholics Anonymous
would really keep alcoholics from quitting drinking.
But look here for some more xerox copies of that attack:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters73.html#disservice">&quot;You have done a great disservice in putting this vile stuff up on the net.&quot;</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters74.html#disservice"> &quot;Telling addicts that simply their own will power will conquer their addiction does them a great disservice.&quot;</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters54.html#disservice">&quot;I feel you are doing AA a dis-service for those who CHOOSE to try it&quot;</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice">
&quot;My dog demonstrates more care and responsibility than you do. Do you think
you are doing mankind a favor by publishing this propaganda garbage? Hardly.&quot;</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters6.html#dangerous">&quot;I think your message is dangerous, both to yourself and to others.&quot;</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters98.html#disservice">
&quot;...you must feel really proud knowing you may have gotten in the way of someone
seeking help...&quot;</a>

</ol>
There isn't much original thinking in that, is there?

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: 2014.07.18: There is now a whole file of such accusations:<br>
<a href="orange-disservice.html" target="_blank">Accusations that telling the truth about A.A. is killing alcoholics</a>.
</font>
<p>
And then you imply that I know nothing about Alcoholics Anonymous.
That's another standard A.A. attack. Ignore the facts and what the guy
actually says, and just claim
that the speaker doesn't know what he is talking about.
<p>
Wrong. Try reading
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction to the web site</a>, just for starters.

<p>
Then you spout the usual unsupported and unverified grandiose claims of success:
<font color="black">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has saved many people that modern
medicine has labeled hopeless and without recourse.&quot;
</font>
<p>
So where are the official doctors' reports of this wonderful healing that is better than
&quot;modern medicine&quot;?
Please be specific. I'll go to the local medical university library and look them up.

<p>
Speaking of which, while you are bragging about A.A.,
what is the actual Alcoholics Anonymous success rate?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#8f0000">
If we send 1000 randomly-selected alcoholics to A.A., how many
of them will get a year of sobriety? How many of those 1-year medallions
will you need to keep on hand to give out a year later?<br>
And how many of those alcoholics will go on to get 2-year, and 5-year,
and 10-year coins?
<p>
(Hint: See the answers <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.)
<p>
And how does that success rate compare to the success rate that comes from
sending 1000 alcoholics to the
local Tiddly-Winks Society, or the Ladies' Home Garden Club, or the
Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlor?<br>
(Hint: the success rate there will be
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">about 50 per thousand</a>.)
<p>
Please answer those questions. They are very important questions, and reveal the
whole truth about &quot;Twelve-Step Recovery&quot;.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Oh, by the way, the fact that you quit drinking the day that you walked into
A.A. is proof that you didn't need either A.A. or the 12-Step program to quit
drinking.
You had not done the program, you had not worked the Steps, you had not gone
to a lot of meetings. You had not done anything but decide to quit drinking
 &#8212; which you then promptly did, way before &quot;working a strong program&quot;.
So A.A. deserves none of the credit for you quitting drinking
hours before you walked into your first A.A. meeting.
You decided to quit killing yourself with alcohol, so you did.
Congratulations on your sobriety.

<p>
It's funny that you criticize my choice of references and citations, and then you 
recommend Joe and Charlie to me.  Joe and Charlie are not
council-approved literature either.
They are just some guys who made up their own dogmatic interpretation
of the 12-Step program and Buchmanite theology.
They don't speak for A.A., do they? Are they official A.A. spokesmen?
More official than Hazelden or Al-Anon?

<p>
And then, lastly, you generously invite me back to the cult:
<font color="black">
&quot;...I invite you back into the
Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous with open arms.&quot;
</font>

<p>
No thanks. That is just such a standard ploy. Again, I can't count how many
times the A.A. true believers have invited me back, and told me that they are
saving a seat for me (for when I relapse)...
<p>
It seems to really bother some of them that I have
8 years of sobriety now, without any Alcoholics Anonymous, or any 12 Steps,
or any sponsor, or any cult religion, or any going to meetings...

<p>
Oh well, have a good day. Now I'm going to go meet with the geese and the sunshine
down at the river, because it's a beautiful day, and too nice to stay inside
in front of a computer.

Hi Ray,
<p>
Ah, good, thanks for the links. More grist for the mill.
And that lets me cross-check some things.

<p>
Somebody wrote to me and complained that the copies of
Form 990 for A.A. (the &quot;GSO&quot;)
that were on the Internet have gotten buried or erased, so
I dug through my computer and finally found the copies that I had saved.
