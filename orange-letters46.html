From:  	&quot;Frank S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Your AA Critique<br>

<p>

I am a member of AA and I feel that I have an open mind, so I am not
offended with your essay, but I do have to question what your motive is.
Why would you try to take away a persons belief if it is not harming
anyone?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Frank,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
First off, where do you get
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;if it is not harming anyone&quot;</font>?
That is the whole problem with Alcoholics Anonymous: it does harm people, a lot of people.
One member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous (World) Services, Inc.,
is Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant. He spent about 20 years shoving A.A. on alcoholics,
trying in vain to prove that A.A. works. In the end he had to conclude that A.A. was
completely ineffective, no help at all, and that its biggest effect was to raise the
death rate of alcoholics. Vaillant called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">Look here</a>.
<p>
In addition, other doctors found that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">A.A. raised the rate of binge drinking</a>,
rather than lowering it, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">A.A. also increased the rate of re-arrests for public
drunkenness</a>.
And another doctor found that A.A. made a lot of alcoholics sicker so that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">they required more expensive hospitalization later</a>.
</font>
<p>

I did not read your entire article but I did read many of the chapters.
I feel the book (and the 12 steps) are not about &quot;not drinking&quot; it is
about getting &quot;out of your self-centeredness&quot;
these are just tools and if you practice them to the best of your
abilities then life seems to go pretty well.
Sure I could get these same principles in many different forms i.e.
Budda, Christ, Native American traditions, they all have the same
concept.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is simply untrue. What the <i>Big Book</i> is about is how you must
join Alcoholics Anonymous and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">convert to Bill Wilson's religion</a>.
<p>
And who says that &quot;self-centeredness&quot; is bad?<br>
That is just another standard rap of cults that want you to surrender yourself to the cult.
Demands that you obliterate &quot;self&quot; is
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_obliterate_self">a standard cult characteristic</a>,
one designed to elicit obedience and compliance in the followers.
</font>
<p>

That you are not in control, so relax and enjoy the ride.
What is wrong with that?
<p>
<font color="blue">
What nonsense. Not being in control, just relaxing and enjoying the ride, is how
we drank too much for too long. What keeps me sober is staying in control of myself
by not taking any drugs or intoxicants.
</font>
<p>
As for the big book, it is a jumping off point for many people that
probably would not have gotten sober.
<p>
<font color="blue">
There is no evidence to support that statement. A.A. has a failure rate, not a
success rate.
</font>
<p>

I know that I would not have listened to a priest or someone else
telling me I could just quit. I know that I did quit on my own but it
was the belief that I could that I did not posses.
<p>
<font color="blue">
But Bill Wilson says that you CANNOT &quot;just quit&quot;. He wrote that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#blank_spot">
your intelligence
and will power are useless</a>, and only surrender to &quot;Higher Power&quot; will save you.
(<i>Big Book</i>, pages 41-42.)
<p>
And Bill said that you have to do his 12-Step cult practices, or else:
<font color="black">
&quot;If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking&quot;</font>
(<i>Big Book</i>, page 72.)
</font>
<p>

I know that I don't have to go to meetings and study the big book to
stay sober, but I probably would be a miserable fuck and not very fun
to be around because I would always be feeling sorry for my self or
pissed off at you. The steps remind me that their are alternate ways
to live, sure I may be able to find other groups or books that can
get me to the same place, but I feel this is working pretty good for
right now. (sober 14 yrs).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but the Steps are just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Frank Buchman's cult practices</a>, dressed up in a poorer
man's shabbier suit of clothes.
They have no beneficial effects, and in fact seem to
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">raise the suicide rate of alcoholics</a>.

From:  	&quot;PIERRE P.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Gambler Anonymous<br>

<p>

I love reading your stuff. Thank you.

<p>

I have been compulsively doing GA meeting during the last 5 years. (At
least 1200 meetings ).
I just cannot stop gambling. I did stop for a year and a half, but just went
nuts with my sexuality during that time instead of gambling.

<p>

After initially going 90 days without gambling, I was told by a member that
I could not be the secretary of a meeting, because I am an atheist!  I felt
like I was an outcast, that I really disturbed many people... in fact I am
sure most members wanted me to slip to prove that I could not succeed.

<p>

The trustee of our region intervened and told me that the member who told me
I could not be a secretary was wrong, I could.  BUT, I could not be be in
charge of the money collected!!!  I guess being a atheist made me immoral
and I would surely leave with the money from the group.

<p>

I slipped after that. I was able to stop gambling for 18 months, then slipped
again. I felt bad and guilty and sub-par to other members. I slowly began to
hear people judging me, telling me I had to get God in my life.

<p>

What really hurts me in GA is the way successful members are just not the
type of people I would want to be. No empathy, no compassion to real
suffering caused by childhood traumatic experiences. Most people that slip
were victimized as children, be it sexual abuse, physical abuse and so on.
They learned to be ashame of themselves as children, and continue to do so
as adults.

<p>

I still want to stop gambling, but I cannot do it with GA. I will have to
find another way.

<p>

Thank you

<p>

Peter

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. It says a lot. And thanks for the thanks.

<p>
I am no expert on recovery from gambling, so all that I can do is offer my uninformed
opinion: The impression I get is that you long for the rush of gambling,
you have a built-in craving for the rush,
and sooner or
later the little addiction monster will be whispering in your ear
that just one gamble, just a little
fun, will be okay now.
(<font color="#4f007f">&quot;We have it under control. It's been so long, we have a handle on it now.
One night of fun will be okay.&quot;</font>)

<p>
That's what I have going on with alcohol and tobacco. I wrote a web page about that
&quot;addiction monster&quot;,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">here</a>. Understanding that seductive voice and his
mind games has been a life-saver to me for avoiding relapses.

<p>
Now I would suggest that there is some underlying reason why you crave the rush, and don't
usually feel quite as good as you would like. Perhaps
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis">
child abuse damaged your <i>cerebellar vermis</i></a>,
or you inherited
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">a genetic defect that crippled your dopamine receptors</a>
and kept you from being able to feel really fully satisfied.
(Do you feel like you are never as fully alive as when you are &quot;in the action&quot;?)
<p>
I would consult with a doctor who really knows about such things, and see if
there are any medications or treatments that can work on those things. &#8212; That's just
a suggestion, not a diagnosis.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

<p>

Who are you to criticize AA?? God's grace has been shed for people in
recovery. You sound like a Pharisee of old who offers only condemnation
and no other workable solution. AA has helped more people than your
diatribes ever will.

<p>

<font color="blue">
Who am I to criticize A.A.? Well, I am a person who has enough remaining brain cells
to see that A.A. is massively dishonest and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">lies about its success rate</a>, and just foists
<a href="orange-rroot060.html">an old cult religion</a>
on sick people.
<p>
A.A. has not helped large numbers of people. That is the A.A.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie"><i>Big Lie</i></a>.
A.A. just steals the credit for people who were going to quit drinking anyway,
claiming that it somehow &quot;made them quit&quot;, or
&quot;helped them to quit&quot;, which is not true at all.
<p>
And then A.A. makes a lot of other alcoholics worse: they

From:  	&quot;carol d.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Thank you!<br>

<p>

My story is probably as funny as anyone else's and I plan to share the
details soon but now I am curious about seriously stopping the lunacy.
I found your site while trying to get info on AA and sponsors and such
since as a condition of my release from a work mandated rehab program
(yes, this idiot got caught drunk at work!) I had to prove I had
faithfully attended meetings (4 per week was recommended) had found a
sponsor AND (this was the kicker) had developed a meaningful
relationship with her.
<p>
Anyway, not sure I'd be able to B.S. my way out
of that without some details, I was searching the web and found your
site!! YIPPEE!! I am not crazy after all! And as my rehab counselor
correctly pointed out (meant as an insult) I _am_ too smart for the
program!
<p>
But since my insurance company paid thousands of dollars for
weeks of 'therapy', I was wondering if they would have an interest in
investigating these 'rehab' centers. Since I was discouraged from going
to my gym (interfered with going to meetings) and encouraged to smoke
('after all, you need something!' &#8212; and that's a direct counselor quote) I
was thinking AETNA might frown on such advice.
<p>
Like so many of your
writers, I found that excessive drinking was doing me no good
and readily gave it up on my own but had to complete rehab to return to
work. I am happily alcohol and AA free now and ready to challenge the
myths that abound surrounding 'treatment'.  I can't think of any way to
curtail AAers damage but since $$ talks, perhaps health insurance is a place
to start. Any suggestions or is this a lost cause? Thanks for any advice
and keep up the good work.

<p>

Finally Free in CT

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Carol,
<p>
Yes, persuing the health insurance angle is a very promising approach.
Personally, I find it amazing that the insurance companies are being so stupid
as to pay billions of dollars for completely ineffective quack medicine.
What's wrong with them? I mean, they were quick to start finding technicalities
to not pay for the damage caused in New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina, and yet they pay
through the nose for 12-Step quack &quot;treatment&quot; of alcoholics and drug addicts?
Go figure.
<p>
At the same time, the insurance companies are at least somewhat resisting paying
for drug and alcohol treatment. It used to be that health insurance would readily
pay for a 28-day residential program. Not any more. Now they only want to pay for
outpatient treatment.
<p>
Still, I keep asking why they don't demand proof that the treatment is effective, and
actually works.
There is no sense in continuing to pay for treatment that doesn't work.
That is one of the big points in
<a href="orange-action.html">my letter to politicians, here</a>.
(Oh, and please do send some emails like that to your
Congressperson and Senators, too. I think that will help.)
I want to harp on the point that if the politicians keep writing blank checks to the treatment
centers, they will just continue to get failure disguised as success.
<p>
Those 12-Step-based treatment programs have never been shown to work. Never.
What few statistics there are that seem to show that treatment works are the results
of fraud and deception and numbers games.
Definitely check out
<a href="orange-letters26.html#treatment_success">this letter to a guy who works
at a treatment center</a> who was complaining about just such things.
<p>
And I wouldn't hesitate to write to insurance companies, and complain, and tell
them clearly that 12-Step treatment is a fraud.
The so-called &quot;recovery industry&quot; has a lot of rich, high-priced lobbyists bribing
Senators and Congressmen to keep the flow of money going to the treatment centers
(they call it giving &quot;fair treatment&quot; to the alcoholics and addicts),
but the insurance companies have big rich lobbyists too. Getting the insurance companies
in our corner is a very promising approach, maybe the most promising one of all.
We are not rich and powerful; they are.
We can't afford to give large &quot;campaign contributions&quot; to politicians; they can and do.
And we have a common interest in not seeing
the &quot;alcoholism treatment&quot; hoax continue.

<p>
<a name="spill_off"> </a>
Oh, by the way &#8212; That bad advice about smoking that you got from your &quot;counselor&quot;
was just like mine. I quit smoking 3 weeks after I quit drinking, because I was really
sick and wanted to truly recover. I had bronchitis so bad that I couldn't both breathe
and smoke, so I didn't really have a lot of choice in the matter, anyway.
(And then that deteriorated into pneumonia.) So what did my
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">coke-snorting, child-molesting counselor</a> say
about me quitting smoking?
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't put too much on your plate or something will spill off.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Fortunately, I ignored his &quot;counseling&quot; and stayed off of
tobacco, as well as everything else.
It's 5 years now, and I still haven't smoked another cigarette. Thank God for small
favors. Free at last. Thank God Almight, I'm free at last. I sure am glad I kept my own counsel.

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Eric&quot;

<p>
First off, let me commend your efforts on your papers.  I am not sure
who you are, what your background/education is, but you are obviously
intelligent, well organized, and present your views thoroughly.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Eric,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
</font>
<p>

I have been in AA for 13 years, and have maintained sobriety for that
period of time.  I am not sure I believe in the God-part of the program
anymore, but I do know that I haven't had a drink in a long time, and my
life is unbelievable better than it was 13 years ago.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your 13 years of sobriety. That gives you the credentials
to speak for Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

Unlike your general view of AA members, I find I do not fit into your
mold.   (or at least what I think your mold is)  I have a few questions
and comments for you.   If you have time to respond, I'd appreciate it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I try to not stereotype A.A. members. I have repeatedly said that they
vary widely. They cover the entire range from really nice people who want
to quit drinking to ego-maniacs and sexual predators and dangerous psychotics.
</font>
<p>

In your introduction, you talk about an AA counselor, whom you later
report was in fact a coke sniffing child molester.  I don't dispute
this, and if it is exactly as you described, hope he never sees the
light of day.  But, in 13 years involvement, I have /never/ been to an
AA group therapy session, nor have I met an AA counselor.  It has been
my experience in meetings that I meet other people who are trying to
improve their lives.  Some are out and out nut cases, some are probably
a little healthier than I am.  But no counselors or group therapy
sessions ever.  Are you describing AA or are you describing some
treatment facility which is not part of AA?
<p>
<font color="blue">
I am describing both. The friendly little neighborhood meeting is like the
smiley-face mask that hides the evil empire.
The 12-Step treatment industry is most assuredly a part of the 12-Step empire.
The treatment centers are staffed by A.A. true believers who spend their days
doing 12th-Step work and recruiting for Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#TC_study">
The only &quot;treatment&quot; for alcoholism
that 93% of the treatment centers in this country offer is the 12-Step voodoo medicine</a>.
Alcoholics Anonymous has made that so.
<p>
In addition, you might want to look at the relationship between corporations like
Hazelden and Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc..
<a href="orange-letters22.html#Hazelden">Hazelden is the biggest and
richest front group for Alcoholics Anonymous</a>,
and the biggest A.A. promoter, and
the biggest publisher of pro-A.A. titles, and the biggest redistributor
of A.A.W.S. publications. Legally, they are separate entities, but they are
very much in bed together.
They both exist to promote the 12-Step religion.
</font>
<p>

Pardon me if I missed the explanation.  To my knowledge,  AA is made up
of people who are trying to solve their drink problems.  Every single
treatment facility, group therapy, psychologist, counseling center, etc,
etc, etc, may use some of the AA ideas, but are in fact separate from AA
itself.  Please correct me if I am misinformed.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, legally they are separate entities. But that is about the only way
in which they are separate and independent.
</font>
<p>

From my perspective, most of the people I know in AA couldn't care less
if you find another way to stay sober, work the program half-assed,
believe or don't believe in a higher power, nor do they &quot;actively
recruit&quot; newcomers into the 'cult'.  (other than to say &quot;if you want
help, we'd love to be able to help you&quot;) I fail to see the motivation
behind recruitment.  I know I will not benefit financially for inviting
a new member.  Yeah, they might throw a buck into the basket, so there
is a potential financial incentive, but who cares?  I don't see the
money, there is no pyramid scheme, and frankly a buck once a week ain't
going to add up to much.  There are some days I'd prefer the folks who
aren't really interested in sobriety to not come to meetings.  I'd like
to be there to offer help and encouragement, as someone was there to do
the same for me 13 years ago, but beyond that I have absolutely no
interest in increasing our membership, recruiting another newcomer, or
increasing our coffers.  What do you see as the motivation behind this
cultist mentality?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Not all cults are about making money. Some are, some aren't. A.A. is one that isn't.
It's about getting more members, and getting more people to do the 12 Steps,
and getting people to &quot;come to believe&quot;.
</font>
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I came to the conclusion that Alcoholics Anonymous is really just a
cult religion...&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

No problem with your belief here, just isn't my belief or experience.
If in fact religion is defined as the state of relating to or
manifesting faithful devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality or
deity, (according the Webster's) then since the higher power discussed
in AA is one of our own understanding, then it cannot be considered an
acknowledged deity, and therefore not a religion.  Yes, maybe simple
semantics, but I consider myself a member of AA, yet at this point in my
life am also a contented agnostic.  I know of others in aa who share
this view.  Does that mean I don't belong?  Does it mean I am not a real
card-carrying member of AA?  Am I an aberration? What it means to me is
that this isn't a religion.

Based on this definition, I could say AA is indeed a cult, as is
Christianity, Judaism, Catholicism, etc.  The term cult has a negative
connotation.  When I consider cults, the Moonies, Hare Krishna's, Jim
Jones, Waco, etc are what readily come to mind.  I may be wrong here,
but aren't most of these systems for the benefit of a single leader or
group of leaders?  I find no one in AA, especially our leadership (if it
even exists) benefit from increased membership.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I find that description of a cult too simplistic and limited.
(See
<a href="orange-cult.html">the Cult Test</a> for a better description.)
<p>
Oh, and there is a huge difference between the established mainstream religions
and cults. Claiming that all religions are cults is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everything_cult">one of the standard
Alcoholics Anonymous dodges</a>
when someone accuses it of being a cult.

<p>
Many of the most popular and
powerful cults, like Scientology, the Peoples' Temple,
and ISKCON (the Hari Krishnas), have dead leaders,
so the cult does not continue for the benefit of those leaders. And the new leaders
are shallow wimps compared to the founders, so the continuation of the cult isn't
for their benefit.
<p>
No, what keeps the cults going is the desires of the members to continue the con game.
The members want to continue to believe all of the things that they were fooled into
believing in the beginning. They have a vested interest in believing that they didn't
waste a lot of time and energy in a cult.

<p>

But, what do you do until the better solution is found?  I know I tried
all sorts of ways to quit drinking, even toyed with RR which was coming
of age back then, and none of those ideas worked for me.  AA did.  I
don't mean to profess there is no better way, just that if there is, I
haven't found it.  And in fact, haven't heard of one either.  As science
and medicine progresses, I do believe there will be a permanent cure for
alcoholism, but until then what else is there?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is the logical fallacy of
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, if we can't get something good,
then you should be willing to settle for something bad.&quot;
</font>

<p>
A.A. does not work. Every single time it has been tested,
it has been found to be a failure. A.A. even does great harm to some alcoholics.
It even kills them. Alcoholics Anonymous
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">increases the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">increases the rate of
rearrests for public drunkenness</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">makes alcoholics sicker and makes their
hospitalization more expensive</a>,
and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">even raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
<li> and there is also a lot of evidence that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">A.A. raises the suicide rate of alcoholics</a>.

</ol>
<p>

You have 13 years of experience in watching A.A. fail to sober up thousands
of people.
You know that the A.A. clubhouse has a revolving door on the front of it.
The newcomers come, the newcomers go. The percentage of people who actually get sobered up
in A.A. is pathetically small.
The fact that you quit drinking and you like the A.A. meetings does not
make A.A. a good thing for other people.
<p>
The whole idea of &quot;a cure for alcoholism&quot; is fallacious.
Alcoholism isn't a disease, it is behavior. It is often compulsive behavior,
but it is still behavior.
Now we might get fixes or cures or treatments
for <a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis">damage to the <i>cerebellar vermis</i></a>,
or inherited
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">genetic defects that cripple people's dopamine receptors</a>,
or mental illnesses like bipolar disorder which is a common cause of alcohol overconsumption.
But that is a cure for an illness that causes people to drink too much, not a
&quot;cure for alcoholism&quot;.

<p>
As far as a better way goes, there are many. Any kind of therapy or treatment

that slightly over 50% of all alcoholics eventually
quit drinking, and 80% of the successful quitters did it alone, on their own.
That makes sense, because really, nobody but you will hold your hand every night

From:  	&quot;Toni B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	We have a cult problem ourselves<br>

<p>

We need help and advice on breaking up part of our family that has a
cult mentality. I myself had constant exorcisms with them among other
things, and we believed that we were above normal rules
and followings that belong to anyone else. We are planning on doing some
sort of intervention very soon with the law backing us up, and would
love some input if you could. My step brother is a retired police
officer, and wants to use the law to force counseling, but I was hoping
that we could try an intervention type thing first, mabey bring someone
in who they will listen to. Please help.
<p>
Thank You-<br>
Toni B.


<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Toni,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer. I didn't realize that this letter was
more important than usual.
<p>
My initial reaction about a forced intervention is DON'T. The reasons are many:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Who could you use as an interventionist or &quot;exit counselor&quot;?
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Ted_Patrick">Ted Patrick</a>
(who liked to call himself &quot;Black Lightning&quot;)
was sent to prison for kidnapping, false imprisonment and cruelty.
There are few or no competent, honest, exit counselors who will participate
in a forced intervention.

<p>
<li> What gives you the right to force your religious beliefs on your other family
members?<br>
Now I'm sure that you think that question unfair, because your nutty true-believer relatives
are trying their best to shove their beliefs on other people, right?
But it cuts both ways.
<p>
<li> And you say that your goal is to &quot;break up part of your family&quot;.
What does that mean, really?

<p>
<li> You say that you will have the law backing you up. 
That is vague. Ordinarily, the courts do not get involved in religious disputes
and force one family member's beliefs on another.
The courts don't want to touch that. We theoretically at least have freedom of
religion in this country.
Even Tom Cruise is allowed to walk
the streets and praise Scientology and rave about bad psychiatrists and tell
mentally-ill people not to take their medications.
<p>
If it's a matter of child abuse, then it is a given that the child should
be removed from the bad environment and custody given to someone better.
But that is not an &quot;intervention&quot; &#8212; that's just rescuing a child.
And that will be legally done by child welfare, with the help of police, not
by some relatives and an ex-cop.

<p>
<li>
Another reason for not doing an intervention is because they often fail, and even do
lots of damage.
(After abusive deprogramming, one girl just sat in her bedroom and stared out of the window
for a year.)
How do you plan to break the will of your family member and change his or her
mind? What methods of torture will be used?
<p>
Do you really imagine that just having some &quot;counselor&quot; talk
to your relatives for a day or two will make them suddenly convert to
your religious beliefs and quit being so crazy?
<p>
And that's what we are really talking about here. You consider the beliefs of
your other
family members to be crazy and unrealistic. They probably are.
(People who do exorcisms are a pretty nutty, whacked-out, scary bunch.)
Still, it really is
a matter of somebody deciding that &quot;My beliefs are better and saner than his beliefs, so he
should change his mind and start to think my way.&quot;
The laws of the U.S.A. say that you can't do that by force.
We have freedom of religion even for the crazy religions.

<p>
<li>
Lastly, what we learned from our collective experience with the cults
of the sixties and seventies is that most of
the cult members eventually &quot;come out of it&quot; and quit the cult all on their own.
The few who don't quit will probably be lifers that you won't be able to save or convert anyway.
</ol>
<p>
Now is there anything that can be done?
I hope so. But it's tough. Crazy true believers in a cult religion really like their
crazy beliefs. They have an intense desire to continue to believe for a variety
of reasons.

You should check out Steven Hassan's book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB"><i>Releasing the Bonds:

which gives a lot of advice about how to get loved ones out of a cult.
<p>
Here are some places in previous letters where we discussed Hassan's ideas for
how to get people out of cults:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan1">Don't give up</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan2">Use indirect criticism of the cult</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters24.html#Hassan3">Phobia induction</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor">Trying to get a young man to leave the cult</a>
</ul>

<p>
Again, if you are seeing a situation where children or any other minors are being
abused or mistreated by a cult religion, then you have every right and even the duty
to do something and rescue that child. Contact the local Child Welfare Agency or Human
Services Department or whatever it is called in your state.
<p>
But if it's just some family members who are crazy as a loon and going off the deep
end with a cult religion, well, legally, they have that right.
You can try to talk sense to them, but you don't have the right to make them change
religions.

<p>

Oh well, have a good day anyway, and good luck.

[2nd letter from Toni:]
<p>



Date:  	Fri, May 19, 2006 12:10<br>
From:  	&quot;Toni B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: We have a cult problem ourselves<br>

<p>

Thank you so much for responding. I wanted to clarify a few things
though. We weren't going to kidnap anyone, of course. We found out that
I can still press charges of my own child abuse that happened to me. The
exorcisms would go for days sometimes, until I admitted I had demons and
asked God to forgive. I know it's hard to believe this is abuse, but it
went on for about 2 years.
<p>
After me came so many others, and it still
goes on. You have no idea how much mental damage it causes. They take
every thing you do and make it evil, quoting even from the Bible. We
were going to use the law in that they have a choice: counseling or
jail.
<p>
Please tell me with this updated version of a intervention some
advice. I was thinking along the lines of meeting with lawyers and the
preacher of the real church we used to go to as a family, and all of us
kids. It just hurts watching them and worrying about who they hurt next.
<p>
They have another child living with them now, and as usual they train
a lot of kids with their horse ranch. Some of the kids in the past
actually formed a support group online for a while. They don't seem to
know they are hurting others and themselves, that they're predators not
preachers.
<p>
I just want to help them somehow. It's hard to walk away,
like with any family member who's messed up. Please write back and tell
me your honest opinion, I hope it's more clear what I'm trying to do.
<p>
Toni

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Toni,
<p>
Ah, okay. In this letter, things are sounding a lot better. I'm really glad that you weren't
thinking of a forceful &quot;intervention&quot;. That's what Steppers do occasionally,
and I'm against it.
And it is of course what the anti-cult people used to do &#8212; kidnapping and deprogramming &#8212;
and I think they did more harm than good.
<p>
As far as pursuing the child abuse charges, that sounds like a very good approach.
Really, it's the only thing that you have.
<p>
And I do believe you. In my years of studying cults for this web site, I've
read some pretty awful stuff,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#JeanneMills">even worse stuff</a>.
It boggles the mind, the depths to which some people can sink.
<p>
Perhaps you have read the
<a href="orange-gulags.html">Children's Gulags</a>
web page. It also describes some abusive camps where children supposedly go sailing
and horse-back riding.

<p>
You say, &quot;it still goes on.&quot;<br>
That alone is enough for me. If they are still doing that to other children now, then
throw their asses in jail.
<p>
I don't have any faith in &quot;counseling&quot;. All too often,
it's just talk, and nothing changes.<br>
(Now in all fairness to counselors, I think they can help borderline
or moderately normal people who just have some simpler problems that they need
to work through, but
counselors aren't going to change vicious psychotics with just some pleasant chats.
It's just like how repeat sexual predators are not reformed by &quot;treatment&quot;.)

<p>
In general, I feel very pessimistic about your chances for any kind of
an amicable settlement.
Those nutcases believe that what they are doing is right, and almost nothing will
change that.
<p>
What you are actually trying to do is undermine their entire world-view,
their idea of reality.
They actually think that they live in a grim fairy-tale world of
demons and devils, and they see themselves as knights in shining armor,
fighting for God and Truth.
They imagine that their lives are grand epic moral melodramas, where they are heroes
bravely battling against the Dark Forces.<br>
(And I imagine that they suppress any recognition of the sadistic side of their actions.
They probably won't even honestly admit to themselves that they enjoy beating and tormenting
devils out of children.)

<p>
They will not give up that heroic image of themselves and accept the
image of &quot;child abuser&quot;.
They will probably insist that they are right until the day that they die.
<p>
The only thing you can do now is stop them from hurting any more children.
<p>
Do it. Do it by any means that you have at your disposal.
Shut them down. Put an end to it.
And filing charges for child abuse is the sharpest sword in your armory.
<p>
It's a shame that your online support group went offline.
But there are others. Some of the non-religious children's boot camps were
just as bad, and there are groups for them.
<p>
You might want to check these out, and see if you find some kindred spirits there:

Subject:  	maybe you had a bad experience<br>

<p>

I am not an AA member, but I have seen AA work for many people to stay
sober.  AA as a whole does not claim to be the sole recovery for
alcoholics; the fact is they say right in the big book few have failed
who thoroughly follow our path.   I think you might be confused with the
actions of certain AA groups vs. AA as a whole.  People who are sick in
the mind (Alcoholism is a disease that affects the brain) are never
going to act 100% well.   The symptoms of alcoholism manifests itself
through behavior sick behavior.  So some groups out there are very sick
and I know for a fact run in a cult like way and certainly people should
steer clear of those groups, but AA as an organization does not endorse
or recommend such behavior.   It is in the traditions of AA that each
group is autonomous.  Meaning a group can declare themselves as AA
provided that they offer the AA program to members but beyond that they
may conduct themselves in anyway they please.   This means that groups
can limit membership according to their own guidelines and maintain
their own criteria for joining and some might demand money, threaten
people, or try to get people to detach from their families.   That
doesn't mean that is AA.  That is certain groups distorting the purpose
and principles for their own personal agendas.   Telling people it is
all a cult is a lie, because not every group would endorse such
behavior.  It is a spiritual program and every AA group I have seen in
practice would never claim to be the only way or the only solution or
they will kill you etc as you claim.   People come and go as they please
of their own free will.  I have seen people get clean and sober using
other treatment programs and religion as well and AA would recommend
this to anyone who couldn't find the help they need within AA and in
fact does in AA literature.   If you had done your research a lot better
you would know that, but you didn't.  You don't know how the world wide
organization runs vs. how groups run.   Putting that out there like you
know for a fact is false and can keep people who need real help from
finding it if they can within AA.  I have seen AA say that it is not for
everyone, but few who diligently follow that path fail to stay sober.
As staying sober is the only way to arrest alcoholism it isn't a cure,
there is no known cure in fact.

Subject:  	cults aa<br>

<p>

Perhaps you or someone you know had a bad experience with a group, it
doesn't mean that the organiztion of Alcoholics Anonymous is a cult.
Cults break people down, leave them feeling worthless without the cult,
take people's money, isolate them from their families and friends, give
the promise of something in return for all their monetary wealth etc.
Cults want something from members in return for their so called promises
that is the bottom line for a cult.  They want something in return for
what they give, in every cult I have heard of it has been all the worldy
possessions of the person that joins or as much as they can get from
them.  Correct?  AA does not do this.  They are self supporting
declining outside contributions, but I bet a real cult would take money
from anyone...  People are not encouraged to give large sums of money
and no property.  There is a reason, because at a certain point it
becomes all ego or pride that drives that sort of giving.  AA doesn't
need that.  If AA were a cult all members would believe the same thing,
that isn't true for AA.  All groups would follow the exact same
guidelines and principles and run each group the same; that truly isn't
done.  Every group is autonomous even if they claim they are an AA group
the groups can call themselves an AA group provided that they offer the
AA program, but no one has to follow it and can in fact impose their own
rules etc.  So while some groups might be threatening and some might try
to control members which is unhealthy, not all do that.  As a whole AA
doesn't claim to have all the answers.  It is right in the big book of
AA.  It encourages members to seek help elsewhere if needed and no one
has to sever ties with family or friends, but if they choose to that is
most likely because that might be a trigger for them to drink.  AA is
simply designed to help people get sober, there is no hidden agenda and
nothing AA can gain.  There are no leaders either.  You can't have a
cult without a leader that benefits.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Heather,
<p>
Thanks for the letters.
<p>
I hardly know where to start, so I guess I'll just start at the top.
<p>
You say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I have seen AA work for many people to stay sober.&quot;</font>
<p>
Actually, you have seen no such thing. What you have seen is some people
quitting drinking. You don't know why they quit. Even if you asked them,
and they said that A.A. did it, that does not mean that A.A. did it; it just
means that they think that A.A. did it. Quack doctors and fake healers routinely
take advantage of such confusion to sell every kind of bad medicine and
fraudulent treatment imaginable.
<p>
I addressed the whole problem of gullible people getting fooled and
giving testimonials for quack cures,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#quack_testimonials">here</a>.

<p>
In addition, you are ignoring the fact that lots of alcoholics
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">spontaneously quit drinking</a>
because they just get tired of the pain and suffering &#8212; they
get sick and tired of being sick and tired, so they just quit. And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">the Harvard Medical School says</a>
that 80% of the successful quitters do it alone, on their own,
without any &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.

<p>
Worst yet, you have also seen <i>a great number</i> of other people who did not
quit drinking, and you are ignoring them, and not counting them as A.A. failures.
That's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational">cherry-picking</a>.
You count the sober people as A.A. successes, but don't count the
drunk people as A.A. failures.
The least you can say about that method of counting is that it is
inaccurate. Disingenuous too, I think.
That is Enron-style accounting.
<p>


So the few people whom you have seen quit drinking do not in any way
prove or even suggest that they quit drinking because of Alcoholics Anonymous.


<p>
To assume that people got sober because of A.A., just because they were
occasionally around A.A., is like this goofy logic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>
<ul>
<li>
A bunch of people went to a Baptist church for years.<br>
<li>
During those years, many of the women got pregnant and had babies.<br>
<li>
That proves it:
Going to Baptist churches causes women to get pregnant and have babies.
</ul>
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b><i>Not!</i></b>
<p>


<p>
How can I be so sure that A.A. does not work to make people get sober?
Simple: Every time A.A. has been tested in a good valid unbiased test, it
completely failed. It even caused the alcoholics to drink and die in
greater numbers. Look
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">here</a>, just for
starters.  Then you could read all of the rest of that file, too.

RE:

What does that mean? Please define &quot;spiritual&quot;.
How does this &quot;spirituality&quot; differ from &quot;superstition&quot;?<br>
Is it a spiritual program if someone prays to Santa Claus?
How about a doorknob or a bedpan?<br>

RE:

<p>

Uh, no. People are sentenced to A.A. every day.
Nearly two-thirds of the A.A. membership got there by being shoved into it
by the legal or health-care systems. The November 2002 issue of the <i>AA Grapevine</i>,
pages 32 and 33, summarized the results of the latest General Service Office
membership survey, and it reported that
61% of the current members were pushed or coerced into A.A. by the courts,
criminal justice system, health care systems, employee diversion programs,
co-workers, or families.
So &quot;coerced&quot; or &quot;forced against their will&quot;
describes a lot of what the real A.A. really is...
<p>
RE:

<p>
Oh yeh? Please show me one official council-approved A.A. publication that
recommended that sick alcoholics go somewhere other than Alcoholics Anonymous
to get sober. I keep hearing that A.A. is the only way.
<p>
Now I know that Bill Wilson yammered a few lines like, &quot;See a doctor&quot;, and
&quot;We know only a little&quot; and &quot;A.A. isn't the only way...&quot; but that was just
a bait and switch trick to sound moderate while recruiting.

<p>
And by the way, you began your letter by saying that
you were not a member of A.A., and yet you keep claiming to have much more
expertise about Alcoholics
Anonymous than I do. Where did you get all of your &quot;knowledge&quot; about A.A.?
<p>
I know that you are a member of A.A., or a member of another 12-Step cult like
Narcotics Anonymous or Al-Anon. You just parrot A.A. dogma and misinformation
and propaganda tricks constantly.

<p>

&quot;Putting that out there like you

<p>
RE:

As staying sober is the only way to arrest alcoholism it isn't a cure,

</font>

<p>
We already covered the
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A.A. isn't <i>the only way</i>&quot;</font>
bait and switch trick.
<p>
Then you parrot the standard misinformation about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;alcoholism can't be cured; you
have to stay 'in recovery' (in A.A.) for the rest of your life.&quot;</font>
<p>
Well alcoholism is behavior, not a disease, so of course there is no cure
for a non-existent disease.

<p>
And now you are using Bill Wilson's trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers">lying with qualifiers</a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...few who diligently follow that path fail to stay sober.&quot;

As in,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path...&quot;
</font>
<p>
If they don't quit drinking, it is all their own fault because they didn't
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;diligently follow that path&quot;
</font>
and they didn't
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;thoroughly follow our path.&quot;
...
&quot;The program is perfect, it's just the people who are imperfect.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Yeh, right. <i>The Program</i> is as infallible as the Pope. It's only the humans
who are imperfect.<br>
(But then why does <i>The Program</i> have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">a 95% dropout</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">failure rate</a>?)

<p>
On to your second letter. You declare,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Perhaps you or someone you know had a bad experience with a group, it
doesn't mean that the organiztion of Alcoholics Anonymous is a cult.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is another standard A.A. line, just another routine
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a> propaganda trick.
<p>
Why can't you imagine that someone could
feel like telling the truth about a fraud that is hurting people, no matter
whether he had a &quot;bad experience&quot;?
Are you incapable of understanding any other motive?

<p>
That is a fair description of Alcoholics Anonymous.
The only part that does not fit is that A.A. does not take people's money &#8212; directly.
They let the 12-Step-based &quot;treatment centers&quot; do it for them.
<p>
But since you claim to know something about cults, you should know that lots of
cults do not take all of the members' money. They just want people's lives, minds,
hearts, and souls.

<p>
About false promises, haven't you ever read Bill Wilson's &quot;Promises&quot;?
Check out this cult test item:
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_promises">79. Promised Powers or Knowledge</a>

<p>
Then you continued with more of the same:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They are self supporting

from anyone...  People are not encouraged to give large sums of money

<p>
Are you really totally ignorant of the fact that the leadership of Alcoholics Anonymous
is so evil, dishonest, corrupt, and greedy that they are even committing perjury
and getting A.A. members sentenced to prison to get more money?

That isn't true either. The city and state councils will de-list any group
that they don't like. Your group had better toe the line, or else.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous was not &quot;designed&quot; as any such thing. Alcoholics
Anonymous is simply
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">a renamed branch of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group
cult religion</a>.
Frank designed his cult to support him in comfort for the rest of his life.
Which it did. A.A. did the same for Bill Wilson.
<p>
And there most assuredly are leaders. Haven't you ever heard of the Alcoholics
Anonymous national headquarters in New York?
They have a Board of Trustees who make over $70,000 per year, and a President who
makes over $125,000.
They have two corporations: Alcoholics Anonymous [World] Services, Inc., and the
General Services Organization.
There is also a national council, state councils, and local councils
and committees.
There is even a committee that reads books and decides whether they parrot
the official dogma enough to be labeled &quot;Council Approved&quot;.
A.A. is loaded with leaders.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<p>
And then on the very local level, the leaders of each group are the old-timers, the ones
who can brag about their zillions of years....
<p>
And obviously, A.A. is totally organized, in spite of Tradition 9 which says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A.A., as such, ought never be organized...&quot;
</font>

<p>
And lastly, you declared,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You can't have a cult without a leader that benefits.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Wrong, totally wrong.
Cults usually start around a charismatic leader, but not always.
As it is,
A.A. started with Bill Wilson and (somewhat) Dr. Robert Smith.
Bill Wilson was the rich, lazy, lying, thieving, philandering
cult leader who never worked a straight job again.

<p>
There are lots of cults that don't have rich pompous leaders any more.
The leaders have died.
Check out Scientology, the Hari Krishnas, and the People's Temple, just
for starters.
And Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob died too, so now A.A. is just another cult
that worships dead founders.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
And please, why don't you practice a little of that A.A. &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;
(<i>Big Book</i>, page 58), and admit that you are a member of Alcoholics Anonymous,
or at least a true-believer Stepper, and have been for a long time?

There aren't any alternative recovery groups in the UK. What can be
done about this?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jill,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That's a tough one. In the long run, I'd recommend that
you start a local group, perhaps either SMART or WFS (Women For Sobriety).
That isn't easy, but might be worth it.

<p>
The easiest quick solution to the problem is to use the Internet
and join on-line chat groups. That isn't ideal, and isn't the same as
neighborhood face-to-face groups, but it's better than nothing.

I've found ur site very informative and well researched. I'm currently in a
facility teaching the recovery dynamics treatment program which is just an
intense AA twelve step program. I'm trying to identify the good parts of
this program so that I can leave and start a support program that doesn't
have all the baggage of AA. Keep up the good work

Hi Dwayne,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and the compliments.
<p>
I have thought a lot about the goods and bads of A.A., and tried to figure out
what could be salvaged from A.A. to make a better program or group or something
that would help alcoholics and drug addicts.
<p>
In particular, I've wondered if a &quot;good cult&quot; could help.
Could we take the clubby atmosphere and the group feeling (and group-think)
and the common idea that we all need to quit drinking,
and make a beneficial organization or therapy?
<p>
That's what Professor Vaillant says A.A. is &#8212; a good cult that does more good
than harm. I see it the other way &#8212; much more harm than good.
<p>
Also see the file,
&quot;<a href="orange-whats_good.html">What's Good About A.A.</a>&quot;
for a longer list of (maybe) good points.

<p>
Have a good day.

Orange-

<p>

I have spent the last two days reading your website,&amp;
am enjoying it immensely. I was active in aa for four years &#8212; from '81' to
'85' &#8212; leaving in '85' because I thought 'aa was getting too weird for me'.
Little did I know! They were weird from the get-go.
<p>

Actually, I quit over
those damn 12 steps &#8212; I couldn't stomach them &amp; my sponser kept nagging me
about going to 'step meetings' &#8212; so finally I fired her &amp; aa.
You are doing an excellent &amp; much-needed job.

<p>

Dear A,

<p>

I recently came across your site, and have enjoyed reading the articles,
and I can't say that I disagree with anything I've read so far.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I've been sober for 26 years, and I did get my start in AA, which I
still attend at times. I prefer going to my SOS meetings, but we have
only four regular members, so now and then, perhaps to entertain
myself &#8212; I'm not even sure why &#8212; I will go to an AA meeting.

<p>

When I go to AA, sometimes I will tell the group that I stay sober
without working the steps, and that a &quot;higher power&quot; has nothing to do
with my recovery.  Some of the group members, for some strange reason,
don't take kindly to my contributions to the discussions, and have
reacted with comments like:  &quot;God placed you in this meeting to teach me
patience and tolerance,&quot; or &quot;I'd take you outside and beat you up if you
weren't so old.&quot;

<p>

Some people get overly emotional when someone offers an alternative
opinion on how best to get sober, and it's interesting to note that
nobody gets bent out of shape when discussing how to quit smoking.  This
difference is likely due to the cultish atmosphere in AA.  And, if
reliance on God really works to end the problem of alcoholic drinking,
then why don't these AA true believers rely on this all-powerful being
to enable them to quit smoking too?  Surely this god isn't a one-trick
pony good for relieving only one kind of addiction.

<p>

That's all for now.

<p>

From:  	&quot;Karen H.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	mystery solved<br>

<p>

Dear Sir

<p>

Been reading your stuff and found it most interesting. I was a member of AA
for about 3 years per enforcement.  To start with I had to go to a clinic
which did not offer any other option but to go to 3 meetings per week.
After I left the clinic I carried on with meetings faithfully as I honestly
believed I would die from alcoholism if I did not.  Throughout my time in AA
I felt very uncomfortable and continuously relapsed.  The more I relapsed
the more they made me feel like I was a nobody.

<p>

I left AA for good and now have nearly 1 year sober.  Throughout this time I
was worried that perhaps I should go back to AA, as I was almost brainwashed
into believing, that perhaps I am just a dry drunk, waiting to relapse.  I
also started looking at alternatives and found your Orange papers site,
suggested to me by a SMART member.  Ah well, hopefully I do not ever have to
go back to AA!

<p>

Best Regards

<br>

Karen

<p>

Hi Karen,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and the story. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
And I also hope you don't have to ever go back to A.A., either.
(Heck, go to SMART or something if you want a meeting. :-)
<p>
With a year of sobriety now, you are over the hump. It isn't like you are
crawling the walls for a drink every night now. Not any more.

<p>
If you want my two cents worth, I'd suggest the web page on
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;,
just as a sort of maintenance lesson.
I don't get cravings much any more, and when I do, they only last a few seconds, so
they aren't a problem. But old lizard brain still yammers now and then about how
we have it under control now, so just one drink would be okay now...
And wouldn't it be fun to get really smashed tonight, just for one night?

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.
