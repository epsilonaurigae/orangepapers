Hello Dr. Koutsenok,

<p>
I would be interested in finding out what your
disagreement is
with
the &quot;point 2&quot; in my memo urging the Veto of AB 239. I think the fact
that a person that considers themself as &quot;in recovery&quot; (and therefore
not DONE with an addiction!), reflects a poor professional standard
to endorse state licensure with. Reviewing the number of AOD
Licensure Revocations from the state of AZ is a good example of this
(people who relapse, and have their licenses revoked as a result!).
People who do not consider themselves to be DONE with their addictive
substances have no business being licensed for a profession, anymore
then a &quot;doctor&quot; would, if that &quot;doctor&quot; was not done with medical
school, or an &quot;attorney&quot; would that is not done with law school. I
think the AOD treatment field deserves a higher standard then that.

<p>
Feel free to e-mail whatever response you think would
make the
argument against the bill stronger though.

<p>
How can a condition be &quot;chronically relapsing&quot; if a person can STOP
doing the substance (thus ENDING the &quot;relapse&quot;? This is a complete
contradiction. It's like saying a person is somehow &quot;powerless to
stop&quot; (as the 12-Step groups think exists) and then STOPS! It makes
no sense. Comparing addiction to hypertension or diabetes is an
incorrect analogy because the person with the condition ALWAYS HAS
IT, regardless of the level of the blood sugar or blood pressure.
On the other hand a person CANNOT be addicted to a substance that
one is NO LONGER USING (it's like saying a smoker who has quit
smoking is still a smoker?). The ridiculousness of addiction as a
&quot;disease&quot; and &quot;not being able to stop&quot; is what forces (like CAADAC)
in the addiction treatment industry want to insure is THE line of
thought in order to insure they will always have a line of work (in
spite of the COMPLETE LACK of medical science that backs up ANY
&quot;addiction&quot; as a &quot;disease&quot;.

<p>
By the way, as an MD, you should be able to answer this
question (that I have always wanted to ask an MD): What exactly is
the medical definition (that would be taught in a medical school)
of a &quot;disease&quot;? Given that &quot;disease&quot; is a medically-bsed word, with
medical criteria being needed to fulfill its definition, you can
see how perverted 12-Step groups have defined &quot;disease&quot; to promote
their own interests and agenda.

Well, John, it would be very difficult for me to answer your

literally thousands of research findings from the last decade or so

disorders. Particularly the ones that came from MRI and fMRI
research.  I can only tell you one thing, and that is that your

science of substance use disorders.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, John,
<p>
I notice that the good professor seems to be changing the definition of
the word &quot;addicted&quot;.  He is using a meaning where if someone's
brain is changed, then they are &quot;addicted&quot;. I totally disagree,
and think that the general medical community will also disagree.
<p>
In the past, I was addicted to alcohol and tobacco for many years, like
20 for alcohol, and 30 for tobacco.  As a result, my brain is permanently
changed and I am hypersensitive to those two substances. If I consume
even a little bit of them, I will soon become readdicted to them.
<p>
But right there, the last sentence reveals that I am not NOW addicted.
(How could I get readdicted if I am still addicted now?)  In fact, I
have not had a dose of either of those drugs in 8 1/2 years, so I am
certainly not currently addicted to those drugs.
I don't crawl the walls for another dose of those drugs; I don't crave
them; in fact, I don't even think about them much, except for when I'm
answering letters here.

<p>
Nevertheless, I am sure that an MRI or CAT scan would show some funny
effects on my brain from those 20 or 30 years of alcohol and tobacco.
I know that I am still slowly recovering my memory &#8212; especially
the short-term memory. It's pretty good now, but there is still room
for improvement.

<p>
I wonder who keeps on rewriting the definitions.  That just confuses the issue.

<p>
I also find this statement to be very strange, and flawed logic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Substance use disorders in general, and the dependence particularly are
chronic relapsing conditions.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Just because some guys can't &#8212; or more accurately, don't want to
&#8212; resist the temptation to return to getting high and partying some more does not
mean that alcohol abuse is a &quot;disease&quot; that is a
&quot;chronic relapsing condition&quot;.
There are certain kinds of incurable terminal constantly-recurring cancers
that could be accurately labeled
a &quot;chronic relapsing condition&quot;, but I don't think that
having fun partying until you get sick matches that description
 &#8212; especially not when there are people like me who just quit drinking, smoking,
and drugging, and don't relapse.
So obviously, the kind of &quot;alcoholism&quot; that I
&quot;got infected with&quot; or &quot;inherited&quot; &#8212; or whatever happened &#8212; 
is not a &quot;chronic relapsing condition&quot;.
So I wonder what the professor would call my kind of chronically non-relapsing alcoholism
(and nicotinism).
<p>
Oh, and above, the professor was saying that people who haven't taken
their drug of choice for years are still &quot;addicted&quot; to it.
But how can people be &quot;constantly relapsing&quot; if they are still
addicted all along?
<p>
The goofy terminology and odd definitions need to be cleaned up, so that we can
have sane and logical discussions, and not be talking at cross purposes.

<p>
Thanks for the letters, and have a good day.
Oh, by the way, I also got around to answering another of your letters, about
genetics. It follows.

Hi Orange,

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Looks like I finally found something on your site I am not in
agreement with. You mentioned that your father was an alcoholic, and
his mother before him. As the &quot;by-product&quot; of TWO alcoholics (one of
whom drank herself TO DEATH-my biological mother), I am
wondering. . . . where the hell is MINE??? I have had my &quot;fair share&quot;
of encounters with alcohol (college drinking), and am NOT an
&quot;alcoholic&quot;. To the best of my knowledge, this &quot;condition&quot; called
&quot;alcoholism&quot; just isn't &quot;passed on genetically&quot; like hair color, eye
color, size of feet, shape of ears, or even TASTE PREFERANCES! I
don't doubt that alcohol (and all other drugs!) affect different
people in different manners (tolerance, and being under the influence-
wise!), but to say that one is an alcoholic because one's parents/
grandparents, and other multiple family members were/are, feeds into
AA's whole BS of &quot;being powerless&quot; over an inanimate drug that one
CHOOSES TO USE! (James Frey nails this in his book, &quot;A Million Little
Pieces&quot;-pp. 191-92). If someone ever &quot;proves&quot; the &quot;genetic
connection&quot; that &quot;causes addiction&quot; to whatever substance (liquid,
solid, or gas), I am sure they will win the Nobel Prize in Medicine!
Until that time, I think it's just a bunch of &quot;apologists&quot; looking
for the &quot;excuse&quot; to justify their own debacuherous conduct. After
all, if you no longer use a substance, how can you be &quot;addicted&quot; to
what you NO LONGER USE, or even be able to quit doing it?

Hi John,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way backlogged
on email.
<p>
The genetic factor is a curious one. First off, because it is genetic, it
is hit-or-miss. You can have both an alcoholic mother and father, and not get
the gene, by inheriting the non-alcoholic recessive genes of your parents.
The gene (or rather, one of them) is reputedly dominant, which means
that the non-alcoholic gene is masked.
<p>
You and I agree that the genetics of alcoholism are not like eye color
or hair color.  Eye color
is totally genetically determined. It doesn't matter whether your parents
drink or pray or dance the polka: if you inherit a gene for blue eyes from
each parent, you are going to have blue eyes. And if either parent gives you a
gene for brown eyes, you will have brown eyes.

<p>
Alcoholism isn't so simple.  Not by a long shot.
I think we agree that there is no gene that <i>makes</i> someone an alcoholic,
with no choice in the matter.
There seem to be at least two genes, perhaps several, that influence how people
feel, and how they react to intoxication.

<p>
And then there are the people who just refuse to drink alcohol. Often, children
of alcoholics refuse to drink and die the way that a parent did.
Again, there is no gene that takes away their choice in the matter.
That creates the appearance that &quot;alcoholism can skip a generation&quot;.
<p>
What makes me strongly believe that there is a genetic component to &quot;alcoholism&quot;
or &quot;alcohol abuse&quot; or &quot;alcohol addiction&quot; is
seeing what happened in me. I am a text-book case of what I have heard described
as &quot;Type A&quot; alcoholism &#8212; the late-starting middle-aged drinker,
as was my father, and his mother before him.
(Type B is the early-starting teenage alcoholic.)
When I was a teenager, I didn't even like alcohol. I never drank it, unless the
whole gang was going out and drinking. And I was living in Germany at the time,
where the legal drinking age is 16, so we could all go downtown and drink beer or
wine all we wanted. Well, I just didn't want it. Sometimes I'd have one glass of
wine just to be drinking with everyone else. No more than that, ever.
I didn't want it until I turned
29, and then something changed, and for the first time in my life, I suddenly liked
coming home from work and having a beer. For the first time in my life, I would
actually go and buy alcohol because I wanted to drink it. And mind you, those were
some of the happiest days in my life. I had a happy family, a beautiful wife and a
delightful son less than one year old, and a good job as a TV repairman, so there
was no big tragedy in my life that was driving me to drink. Just the opposite.
(Oh, and I wasn't smoking tobacco then either, or smoking pot, or taking anything.)
<p>
Some biological clock ticked over, and I suddenly
liked beer and I liked the alcohol buzz, which I had always disliked before.
<p>
The rest is history. One beer after work turned into two, three, four, and kept
going up, year after year, until it was killing me.
<p>
<br>
Here's the medical evidence that I know about:
<p>

In the book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS">
<i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-Step Programs</i></a>
by James Christopher</b>, 
check out the interview with Kenneth Blum, titled
&quot;The Fickle Gene&quot;. Blum discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcoholism, and perhaps also a
tendency towards drug addiction.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Alcoholism and some other addictions and compulsions have in
common the inability to achieve satisfaction from limited
quantities of a pleasure stimulus. This inability, &quot;reward
deficiency syndrome,&quot; is hard-wired into the brain and appears to
be linked to a genetic variation in the D2 receptor of chromosome 11.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">See

<i>Reward Deficiency Syndrome</i>, Kenneth Blum and others,
<b>The American Scientist</b>, March-April

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And recently, an article stated that there is evidence that
&quot;A Functional Neuropeptide Y Leu7Pro Polymorphism [is] Associated
With Alcohol Dependence in a Large Population Sample From the United
States&quot;. They say,
<font color="blue">
&quot;This is only the second specific
genetic mechanism ever identified that modulates risk for alcohol
dependence.&quot;</font>
(See: <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>. 2002;59:825-831;<br>

http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html</a>)<br>

<p>
I like that careful terminology:
<i>Modulates the risk for</i>, not <i>causes</i>, alcohol dependence.

<p>
I hope this sort of explains something.

Have a good day.

<font color="blue">
May 6, 2009, Wednesday: Day 6:<br>
The weather was good in the afternoon, just for a change, so we went to
Waterfront Park. Carmen flipped when she saw families of geese with goslings.
She wanted to join one of those families so badly.
She was repeatedly rejected.
<p>
Carmen liked me just fine, and we got along great, and she came back to me when
she was rejected by the other geese, but she really wanted a goose mother and a bunch
of little gosling brothers and sisters. She just wanted to be a goose and have a normal
gosling childhood.
<p>
When Carmen saw this family with five goslings, she ran off
to join them. Here, she has just done an end run around the father, who saw her coming,
and put his head down and gave her a glare and pointed his beak at her.
The father is behind the mother, and has his head down. He gave Carmen a hard
disapproving stare when he saw her coming, but he didn't bite her. Carmen
ignored him and just ran around him
and planted herself in the middle of the brood of goslings.

Carmen running to join a family of goslings
</center>
<p>
This family was surprisingly tolerant, and allowed Carmen to join in and play and eat with
their children. Usually, broods don't mix, and the parents bite other parents' goslings
and drive them away. But Carmen spent hours with this family, and for a while it was
looking like they might adopt her. This family has 5 goslings that are noticeably
older and larger than Carmen.

The mother goose is saying something to the goslings. Carmen is the small one in the middle.
</center>
<p>
The expressions on the faces of the goslings are priceless. This warrants some magnification:

Carmen is the small gosling by the mother's head.
Here, Carmen is trying to get into the mother's good graces.
Carmen was constantly sidling up to the mother and trying to get the mother's approval and acceptance.

An obnoxious kid mouths off. Carmen is the small one on the right who is getting yelled at.
</center>
<p>
I can't be sure, but I suspect that what that little guy was saying is, &quot;Hey! You can't
have any of this bagel. You aren't our sister!&quot;
<br>
The eye on the ground is a gosling that has put its head to the ground and then turned
its head sideways so that it can peck on the bagel from the side. You can do that if you
have a long neck as flexible as a goose's neck.

It is amazing that you would take so much of your time and effort to disprove
a method that has worked for so many.  For you to even begin to see this
organization as a cult is totally ludicrous.  Truly, you don't know of many cults
where you may come and go as you please.  The 12 steps are suggestions.  You
talk about the horror stories of the program and the manipulations that Bill
Wilson uses to lure people into a cultish program.  What is the payoff?  No one
really gains anything except for a new way of living.  Surely the Catholic
church has something more going on for you to dip your mind into.

<p>
Does the program work.  Yes, the program works to help people not only
achieve a alcohol free life, but mainly it helps people to achieve a new way of life
based on spiritual principles.  Now whats so wrong with that.  No one is
putting down those who can quit without the program.  Its great that people can do
that.  Perhaps this program is for people who found that they can't quit
without a program.

<p>
One thing for sure, it works.  And let me leave you with this.  The 12 steps
are guides to a new way of life.  Much like the guidance that you get by going
to church.  It only mentions alcohol once.  The true change is within the

Hello, Jaciti,
<p>
Well, you have a bunch of the standard A.A. lies and propaganda lines
and slogans in that letter. Unfortunately, none of them is true.
<p>
<ol>
<a name="helped_millions"> </a>
<li>
<font color="black">
&quot;A.A. has worked for so many.&quot;<br>
</font>
and
<font color="black">
&quot;One thing for sure, it works.&quot;<br>
</font>
and
<font color="black">
&quot;...a program that works...&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
That is not true at all. A.A. has a failure rate that approaches 100%. The only people
who get sober and recover in A.A. are the ones who were going to recover anyway, without
A.A. &quot;help&quot;. They quit drinking by using their own will power and
intelligence and common sense, and then A.A. takes the credit for their hard work.
But A.A. never takes the blame for the millions who don't quit drinking.
<p>
We have been over this so many times that I will refer you to some places where
we discussed it before.

</ul>
<p>
Now I offer you the chance to tell us what the actual A.A. success rate really is.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
<p>
<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;...to see this organization as a cult is totally ludicrous.&quot;<br>
</font>
and<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Truly, you don't know of many cults where you may come and go as you please.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
Of course A.A. is a cult.  It passes
<a href="orange-cult.html">the cult test</a> with flying colors.

<p>
And I know of lots of cults where people
are physically free to come and go. Shall we start with Scientology and the Moonies?
How about the Hari Krishnas and Soka Gakkai?
In fact, <i>most</i> cults &#8212; the vast majority of cults &#8212; allow
people to physically come and go as they please.
Very, very few cults are like Jim Jones' People's Temple was, keeping them in
armed compounds, shooting those who
tried to leave. People were even allowed to leave David Koresh's Branch Davidian
compound at Waco, Texas,
while it was under seige, and those people were the last to get out alive.
Nobody shot them in the back as they were walking out and leaving David Koresh behind.
<p>
Now we have been talking about being <i>physically</i> free to leave. Mental freedom
is another thing. Cults routinely use
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias"><i>Phobia Induction</i></a>
to make people afraid to leave. If you leave Scientology,
you supposedly won't get the promised clarity and mental powers, and your huge investment
will be lost. If you leave the Moonies, the Devil will get you.
And if you leave Alcoholics Anonymous, you will supposedly relapse and die drunk in a gutter.
Not true.

<p>
<a name="suggested"> </a>
<li>
<font color="black">
&quot;The 12 steps are suggestions.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is another standard propaganda line. When he was writing the opening chapters
of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson wanted the Steps to be program requirements.
But the less dogmatic and fanatical A.A. members objected that such a hard-core
religious attitude would drive away many of the alcoholics whom the new A.A.
organization was supposed to help.
<a href="orange-religious_faith#spiritual_tolerant">Jim Burwell, the resident atheist</a>,
took the credit
for getting that &quot;suggested as a program&quot; line into the <i>Big Book</i>
at the start of Chapter 5.
<p>
But Bill Wilson got his revenge soon. Very soon, like on the first page of the next
chapter that he wrote, Chapter 6:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, page 72.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then Bill Wilson really cranked up the pressure in his second book. There he said
that you will die unless you &quot;follow the suggested Steps&quot; right:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant.
His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So that is quite some &quot;suggestion&quot;.
<font color="black">
<i>&quot;You will die unless you follow my suggestion.&quot;</i>
</font>
That isn't a suggestion &#8212; that's blackmail.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;What is the payoff?&quot;
</font>

<p>
A big fat ego trip for Bill Wilson &#8212; years of self-aggrandizement and
pretending that he was working for God,
and a lifetime of free money so that Bill Wilson never had to work a straight
job again, and a free house
in the country (&quot;Stepping Stones&quot;), and a free Cadillac car to drive,
and a stable of mistresses
for Bill Wilson, supported by make-work jobs in the A.A. headquarters.
<p>
That was then, this is now:
<ul>

<p><li> Again, <i>ego trips</i>. The old-timers like to tell themselves
that they have devoted their lives to helping others, not that they were fools to
destroy their lives with alcohol and then go join a brain-damaged cult.

<p><li> <i>Desire to believe</i>.<br>
Who wants to admit that he doesn't really have a ticket to Heaven?<br>
Who wants to admit that he doesn't really have a hotline to God?<br>
Who wants to admit that he has wasted years on a cult?<br>
Who wants to admit that A.A. doesn't work at all, and just wastes people's time,
and even hurts them by teaching them grossly wrong things about alcoholism and recovery?<br>
Who wants to admit that A.A. kills more alcoholics than it saves?

<p><li>
<i>Alleviation of fear</i>. Again, the cult induces phobias &#8212;
&quot;You will die drunk in
a gutter!&quot; &#8212; and then A.A. pretends to offer salvation.
&quot;The A.A. program will save you.&quot;

<p><li>
<i>Money</i>. The A.A. leaders in the Interchurch Building in New York City
are pulling down anything from $70,000 to $125,000 per year.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<p><li>
<i>Money, Sex, and Power</i>. Sub-cult leaders and their lieutenants get
a free ride financially, and a young girl in every bed. Mike Q. of the
&quot;<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">Midtown Group</a>&quot;
is the poster child for that. I hear that Clancy and his
&quot;Pacific Group&quot; are the same.

<p><li>
<i>Religion</i>. A.A. members still like to tell themselves that they are working
for God, doing God's will, and selflessly helping others (by recruiting them into
the religion).

<p><li>
<i>Denial</i>. A.A. members refuse to even hear about the true history of A.A., or the
sky-high failure rate, or the harm done to alcoholics. They just go into denial
and proclaim that everything is wonderful.
<p><li>
<i>A social club</i>.
A.A. functions as a social club, and for some A.A. members, it is their only social
circle.


</ul>


<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;...it helps people to achieve a new way of life
based on spiritual principles&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step12">There are no &quot;spiritual principles&quot;</a>
in the cult practices of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group, which
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Bill Wilson stole and made into Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;No one is putting down those who can quit without the program.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Baloney. Bill Wilson sneered at such people and called them  
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#two_stepper">two-steppers</a>&quot;</i>
&#8212; people who only wanted to quit drinking, and didn't want to do
all of his Twelve Steps or practice his cult religion.
<p>
Oh, and then A.A. members routinely declare that people who quit drinking without
doing the 12 Steps are &quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunks</a>&quot;.
So much for &quot;not putting them down&quot;.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;Perhaps this program is for people who found that they can't quit
without a program.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Perhaps that program isn't for people who want to get healthy.<br>
Perhaps that program isn't for people who want to quit drinking.<br>
Perhaps that program isn't for people who &quot;can't quit without a program.&quot;<br>
<p>
That is the propaganda trick called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions">Sly Suggestions</a>
You offer no facts to support the assumption that A.A. works. You only offer a sly
suggestion that maybe it might &quot;be for them&quot;.

From:  	&quot;Mike P.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Buchman/Himmler correspondance<br>

<p>
Hi Agent Orange,

<p>
Glad to see you are back online and answering emails.  I really have gotten a lot
from your writings.  Next week I will have 18 years sober. I have pretty much weaned
myself off of AA over the past few months and haven't died yet (although I plan to
do so sometime in the future).

<p>
After reading your essay regarding the links between Fascism and the Oxford Group, I
became interested in obtaining some actual correspondence between Frank Buchman and
Heinrich Himmler.  I thought I had found something promising when I picked up a used
copy of a book called Reichsf&uuml;hrer: <i>Briefe an und von Himmler</i>
 (Letters to and from
Himmler).  I found that the letters therein mainly have to do with Himmler's duties
as SS leader.   A lot of the correspondence has to do with mundane administrative
matters, various decrees and directives, and other issues, not to mention all the
planning involved in the wholesale annihilation of Jews, homosexuals, Communists,
and sundry dissidents.

<p>
I did find a few interesting letters in which Himmler had alcoholic SS members
arrested, stripped of position, and forced into detox cures.  In one instance he
ordered an underling to stay sober until the end of 1944 (the letter was written in
May of that year). The most interesting letter I found concerns the imprisonment of
an alcoholic Nazi in the Dachau concentration camp on grounds of &quot;conduct unbecoming
of a Nazi&quot; (those are my words, based on the translation of the German letter I
did):

<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

May 18th, 1937
To: Anton Lehner, Dachau Concentration Camp.

<p>
My dear Lehner Toni!

<p>
Of course you will be let go.  For the time being I need to withhold the release
date. Upon your release, I will also provide you a position.  I'll have you released
when I have become convinced that you have completely sworn off alcohol, which
throughout the years has held sway over you to the detriment of both yourself and
your family, thereby causing you, a long time Nazi, in many instances to set an
unworthy example. The punishment did not come from the F&uuml;hrer in order to harm you,
rather to take you from a path that has led both you and your family into the abyss.

<p>

Anyway, good to see that forced attendance in &quot;rehabs&quot; is not a thoroughly American
phenomenon.

<p>
Kind regards,

<p>
Mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. First off, let me congratulate you on your 18 years of
health and sanity.
<p>
And then thanks for the history. Not entirely coincidentally, I was watching a video
that I downloaded from the Internet a while ago (whose name I can't remember at the
moment), that was about the infighting
at the highest levels of the Nazi Party. Heinrich Himmler was vicious as
he clawed his way to the top. In the beginning, before Himmler became the Police
Chief of all of Germany, and head of the S.S., Himmler's main
rival was the Chief of Police of Prussia. Remember that Himmler was the Chief of
Police of Bavaria at that early time.
Neither was inherently the Chief of the civilian police of the entire country,
but Himmler wanted to be that Chief. When one of the proteg&eacute;s of a rival
drank too much, Himmler exploited that weakness to discredit the fellow
and ruin his career. And yes, he sent those unfortunate fellows to Dachau.
<p>
It really is downright bizarre, how such men could demand &quot;high moral standards&quot;
and sobriety from others as they shoved millions of Jews, Priests, ministers,
political dissidents, gypsies and gays into the concentration camps and gas chambers.
But, like Paul Diener remarked, Naziism was another
&quot;spiritual health and purity movement&quot;.  Look

Hello Christopher,
<p>
We were just talking about Passages of Malibu a little while ago.
It's the luxurious, super-expensive rehab resort where all of the movie stars go.
Their real success rate seems to be no higher than any other treatment or rehab
center.
<p>
Watch out for the wording and terminology: Rehab centers almost invariably brag about
what percentage of their <b><i>graduates</i></b> are sober for maybe one month
following graduation.  They don't tell you what percentage of the incoming
patients actually last until graduation. The habitual relapsers don't &quot;graduate&quot;.
And the rehab/treatment centers never do long-term follow-ups,
to see how many of their graduates are still clean and sober a year or more after treatment.
So it's all just a fake-out numbers game where they are decieving you with
half-truths and weasel words.
<p>

Check out this link,

Get a clue. The real deal is that no one cares about Bill Wilson's

He was a player in a bigger plan.

Well, hello &quot;black bear hollow&quot;,

That is a demonstration of several of the standard cult attack and debating

which isn't true at all. Alcoholics Anonymous merely appears to work okay if
the alcoholics will kindly quit drinking by using their own will power, and then

<p>
Thank you for the article. I had resolved my drinking habits 28 years ago.
Now I am a person displaying &quot;Dry Drunk&quot; behavior according to a divorcing
wife in her appeals to her friends for speaking my mind on matters
concerning spousal issues with our 17 yr old son. I began to feel as though
she may be right.  As an agnostic, I had problems with AA some thirty years
ago and was considered &quot;Not willing to change&quot;. Your article has helped me
put this accusation into perspective.

<p>
Hello A,

<p>
I would be interested to know your interpretation of &quot;Thirteenth
Stepping&quot;. When asked why he doesn't seek a sober girlfriend, my &quot;true
believer&quot; friend &quot;admits&quot; that he cannot date &quot;one of those girls&quot; in
AA. He says it is because they may relapse and he does not want to
handle that (there's a guy who is practicing the 12th, huh?). I think it
is because of the 13th. And curiously, why is the 13th not listed?? Hmm.

<p>
To me, that just does not make any sense. If you claim to live a sober
lifestyle than why not seek other sober people to have relationships
with. Especially intimate ones. After all a true believer claims no one
understands him but his AA family or another drunk.

<p>
Being an ex Moonie, I do understand, even though he claims I do not. I
just don't agree. Now I am &quot;one of those people&quot;.

<p>
:o)

<p>
Thank you.

<font color="blue">
Hello Jonna,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. The only interpretation of 13th-Stepping that I have is that
I thought it really referred to an old-timer taking advantage of newcomers,
like an older male sponsor teaching the 12 Steps to a young woman newcomer,
and then he takes her into the bedroom and teaches her the 13th Step.
I never considered an honest love affair between equals to be &quot;13-Stepping&quot;.
<p>
Indeed, if &quot;The Program&quot; really works, then what better spouse to choose than
another sober person from A.A.?
<p>
Ah, but the program doesn't really work, and your friend knows it (even if he denies
that fact out loud),
so your friend was wise and perceptive to refuse
to choose a partner from within Alcoholics Anonymous.
I would also be very reluctant to choose a mate from the ranks of A.A.,
for much the same reasons.
I have enough problems already.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I have read your article and I am curious if<br>
1. You are an alcoholic,<br>
2. Have a personal faith in God.<br>

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I was an alcoholic, but it is debateable whether I am one now.
It depends on your definition of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
We have discussed this before, several times,
so I won't repeat it yet again. I'll just refer you to the various definitions
of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;,
<a href="orange-letters86.html#definitions">here</a>
<p>
I recognize the phrase &quot;a personal faith in God&quot; as code words that are used
by some sects to mean that you have bought into a standard package of beliefs and
superstitions.
<p>
The answer to that is, &quot;No, I haven't drank the koolaid, and I haven't bought into
any standard package.&quot;
<p>
Now I have a lot of faith in God. I can see that God is working very hard to keep
the Law of Gravity working right. And He has the electromagnetic forces tuned nicely
too, thank you. And the strong and weak nuclear forces are doing well.
All kinds of things are working properly due to His engineering.
<p>
But if you were to ask me whether God really cares if the Pharoah enslaves the
Israelites, or whether Joe Blow is screwing his secretary, my answer is, &quot;I don't think
so. God seems to be very busy on higher planes.&quot;
<p>
Likewise, I don't expect God to give special favors to members of Christian churches
while rejecting Buddhists, Moslems, Hindus, Jews, and Native Americans.
<p>
And I <i>really</i> don't expect God to give any special favors to members of
Alcoholics Anonymous because those people drank too much alcohol and then
started practicing <a href="orange-rroot060.html">Buchmanism</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange,

Thank you for your website and all of the hard research you've done on AA and it's

I've been in AA for 3 years and I am delighted that what I saw in AA wasn't all just

<p>
That must have took a lot of time and effort on your part. Thank you for
that.

<p>
I went to AA about 6 years ago, followed these &quot;contradictions&quot; Bill Wilson
conjured up and havent had a drink since.. My life has become increasingly
better, each year it seems to get better. I have reformed relationships with
friends and familly. It has trully changed my life for the better.

<p>
This is the same for millions more around the world.

<p>
I understand you are just trying to inform people of your belief and point
of view on this, but I must ask why?

<p>
Why is it that a fellowship such as alcoholics anonymous that helps so many
ppl rebuild their lifes for better upsets you so much.

<p>
And While Im still in the middle of your write up, Im curious as to your
suggestion to me, or someone like me to stop drinking? This must be for
free, as I can go to AA for free..

<p>
I am a convicted felon, I have been arrested as a result of alcohol and
drugs over 20 times, I have had 2 DUI's and alcohol related car crashes.
Would you prefer I didn't go to AA and remained driving around on the same
streets as your familly?

<p>
Thanks for your inpupt.

Hello Brain,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I am glad to hear that you are doing well.
Congratulations on your sobriety. Congratulations for saving your own life.
Nobody else did it for you.
<p>
You are mistaken on the arithmetic though, when you say that A.A. has
helped or saved &quot;millions more around the world.&quot;
That number is off by a few million. The claim that A.A. has saved
the lives of millions of alcoholics is the standard
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">Big Lie</a>&quot; of Alcoholics
Anonymous. It is the biggest lie that they tell.
The real number that A.A. has saved is approximately zero.
I was just answering the same statement a few letters ago, so I'll refer
you to that discussion,
<a href="orange-letters120.html#helped_millions">here</a>
<p>
And we were talking at length about what works, and what really helps alcoholics,
just a little while ago, so I'll refer you to that discussion,
<a href="orange-letters103.html#what_works">here</a>.
<p>
As far as your attempt at debating by asking if I would
<font color="black"><i>
&quot;prefer [you] didn't go to AA and remained driving around on the same
streets as your familly&quot;</i></font>,
that is bad logic.
I would prefer that you do something that actually works, and actually helps
alcoholics to get a grip and live a healthier lifestyle, and don't drive
drunk any more. A.A. does not do that.
A.A. kills more alcoholics than it saves, and A.A. does not work to sober up the alcoholics.
And that is why I criticize it.

<p>
Have a good day.
