Subject:  	Re: The Twelve Steps, Interpreted<br>

<p>
Well the numbers are interesting. I can't even say I think they are
wrong. There are many problems with using this as a metric for the
success of AA (as Im sure you know !)..

<p>
How many newcomers are there ordered by law, to get court cards
signed ? Go to any meeting and watch about a quarter of the people in
the room are getting a court slips signed after the meeting. While
they may take chips while attending, clearly, the majority are not
there to get sober and stay sober, they have to be accounted for don't
you agree ?

<p>
Now, how many of the people in the rooms of AA decide the either don't
want to do the work or don't stay around long enough to begin the work
etc..thus &quot;dropping out&quot;..?

<p>
A true measure of the success of the program is not in coin sales,
that's ridiculous. It's in the number of people who actually work
through ALL TWELVE STEPS.. Those are the people that are working the
program as designed and the only true measure of if the PROGRAM is
successful. You wouldn't determine a low success rate of medical
school based on how many kids wanted to be doctors when they grow up
but in turn decided to do something else would you ?

<p>
Maybe next time take a poll of all the AA people you can find who have
completed the 12 Steps, then ask how many have relapsed and how long
they have had continuous sobriety.

<p>
Like I said before, irresponsible.. This website takes the info that
helps prove your point and uses that but fails to use any data that is
relevant.  Why do you even insist on disproving AA ?

Hello again, Greg,
<p>
You are quibbling and using qualifiers. Whether A.A. helps or hurts people does not
depend on whether people did all Twelve Steps to your satisfaction.
You are simply trying to disavow all bad results by claiming that most people didn't work the
Steps the way that you wish they did.
<p>
There is much more to A.A. than just doing the 12 Steps, like going to meetings and getting told
that you are powerless over alcohol, and cannot save your own life through self-reliance and
will power. And that your thinking is defective and you cannot trust your own mind, so you 
should turn control of your life over to
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the sexual predator next to you</a>
who will be your sponsor and tell you what to do.
<p>
Then there is the indoctrination in grossly unrealistic medieval dogma, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#anti_intellectual" target="_blank">the anti-intellectual
attitude of A.A.</a>, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the constant put-downs</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-letters127.html#no_meds" target="_blank">telling sick people not to take their medications</a>
Then there are all of the things listed in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>.
There is a lot to A.A., and most of it is bad.

<p>
I have a lot more evidence of the A.A. dropout rate and failure rate than just the numbers of coins
given away.
For a spreadsheet that was prepared by the Foxhall A.A. Group in Omaha Nebraska that purported to
show that A.A. was a great success,
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="newwin82">look here</a>.
They tried to make A.A. look successful, but their own numbers showed that A.A. is a failure.
Each year they take in 400 or 420 newcomers, and only keep 10 of them.
That has been happening for many years.
And the last full year for which they gave numbers, 2007, they also lost 14 oldtimers, for a net loss of
four members. Four hundred and twenty-one newcomers in, and four fewer members at the end of the year.
So much for keeping them in, and keeping them sober.
<p>
See the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>
for much more evidence of the A.A. failure rate. It even contains
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">statements from Bill Wilson and
his secretary Nell Wing</a>
about the A.A. failure rate. And Lois Wilson's secretary, too.

By the way, Dr. Vaillant is a true believer in Alcoholics Anonymous,
just in love with the cult religion. He is even on the Board of Trustees of A.A., and he is one of the
biggest promoters of A.A. on the planet. He was trying to prove that A.A. works when he accidentally
proved that A.A. kills. 
Eight years of testing A.A. on alcoholics produced a zero-percent improvement in the sobriety of
the alcoholics, along with the highest death rate of any method of treating alcohol abuse that
he studied. Undisturbed by the facts, Vaillant still insists that all alcoholics should
get shoved into A.A. anyway, so that they can confess their sins to a sponsor, even if it kills them.

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Actually you hit it on the nail on your first answer. My addiction to
alcohol was 'mild' if there is such a thing
in the opinions of unfortunately too many people until my flare up in
October of 2009. What has ostrasized me and what influenced me to start
drinking to get drunk was actually bitterness about my smoking. When no
coffee shops were available to do my work ... I started actually studying
and writing in bars of all things about 12 years ago When after working
long hours and feeling lonely I visited friends they would nag about my
smoking to a degree that I just started withdrawing and enjoying my boozing
in bars instead ... cringe ... at the memory of it. Everytime I got
insulted by strangers about my smoking ... again a wonderful excuse to
drink. In fact when the bars stopped allowing cigarettes this is when I
started drinking alone at home...

<p>
For about 12 years every time I have tried to quit smoking and failed I
drank over it more heavily. And in 2010 when I commited to quit drinking
lapses folowed my attempts to quit the cigs. My last attempt to quit was in
July of 2010. This time with Chantix and I wound up in the worst horrific
depression of my life. The good thing though is that while I discontinued
both the medication and my attempt to quit cigarettes I learned and stuck
to priority 1 which was and will remain no matter what never to drink again.

<p>
Popular mainstream US culture might try to make me feel like a menace to
society when I smoke outdoors twenty feet away from people but I DO KNOW
better. Being a high functioning, bi-monthly drink till I drop just for a
night closet lush made me a real menace.

<p>
Why I want to do this: To live freely and not be ruled anymore by any
injested substance ever again.

<p>
Knowing that I had disarmed the booze beast permanently even through a
major depression actually has given me a deep strong desire to cherish and
care for the remaining years I have on this planet so ... I want to do this
again and do it right for good WITH NO MORE DRAMA thank you. And I live in
a place I will not be made to feel I am garbage for smoking ... yet ... But
this does not matter to me anymore.

<p>
Thanks Again Orange

<p>
PS
I will be using RR for this but I would very much like your comments on how
you found quitting cigarettes similar and different from your quitting
drinking.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Pura Vida,
<p>
What was just the same between quitting drinking and quitting smoking was having the
little lizard brain yammering his lines about &quot;just one will be okay&quot;, &quot;we have it under
control now, we can do just one.&quot;
It was the same voice, and the same bad logic, and the same desire to consume
something to feel better.<br>

<p>
By the way, there is a great deal of similarity between what Rational Recovery is teaching,
and what is in the web page on
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
When I was reading
<a href="orange-top10.html#Trimpey2" target="_blank"><i>Rational Recovery</i></a>,
I noticed that what Jack Trimpey calls &quot;The Beast&quot; was
the same thing as what I had been calling &quot;The Addiction Monster&quot;, just some stupid
voice that will lie to you and tempt you to drink or smoke.
<p>
I strongly recommend that you learn about that stuff. It is a real life-saver.
Where I always got into trouble was with the mind games. There are two parts to quitting smoking, or
drinking.
First, you go through the physical withdrawal, and then, when it should get easier, it doesn't.
The mind games start, and little old Lizard Brain starts yammering about how it's really
time to just have one now. And he's got a zillion excuses for why it's okay.

<p>
What was different between quitting drinking and quitting smoking
was that quitting smoking was actually harder. Nicotine is a very strange
drug and it really wraps its tentacles around the channels in your brain.
I craved tobacco a lot more than alcohol. Because I quit both alcohol and tobacco at the same
time, I experienced cravings for both, but I'd crave tobacco like 55 minutes out of the hour,
and only crave a beer for like 5 minutes, and then it was back to another 55 minutes of
wanting a cigarette. (Oh, by the way, primitive old Lizard Brain is so stupid that he cannot
crave two things at once. It was always one or the other, but never both at the same time.
It's like somebody who is too stupid to both chew bubble gum and walk at the same time.)

<p>
I didn't take or use anything to quit alcohol, but I used nicotine patches to get off of cigarettes.
I recommend that people give them a try. They really made it easier for me.
Usually, I'd be flipping out when I quit smoking. The insanity was what got to me.
I'd end up having a cigarette just to keep from flipping out. But I didn't
have that problem when I used the patches.
<p>
Now I have heard complaints that the patches didn't
&quot;make&quot; people quit smoking. That is an unfair criticism &#8212; that isn't what the patches do.
You still have to be 100% convinced and determined to quit cigarettes.
The patches just split the withdrawal into two phases, which makes the withdrawal much more
manageable, because you can handle the withdrawal a half at a time.
<p>
During the first phase, you detox from all of the other poisonous,
addictive things in cigarette smoke, and there are literally
hundreds of them, while continuing to get a dose of nicotine.
Then during the second phase, you cut down on the dose of nicotine, by
using progressively weaker patches, until you aren't using them at all.
<p>
I was practically tripping for the first few days on the patches,
as I detoxed from the poisons of cigarettes. I sat and stared at a brick wall, and marveled at
how vivid the color of the old bricks was, and how the brick wall was just vibrating
with &quot;brickness&quot;. Unfortunately, such fun stuff doesn't last very long.
<p>
Then I started to feel like I was overdosing on nicotine. I was getting an unpleasant metallic
bitter taste in my mouth, so I switched to weaker patches. I only used them for about two weeks
altogether. The doctors had expected me to be on them for about two months, but I wanted to
get done with it as soon as possible. And it was possible in two weeks.
<p>
But the patches really helped when they helped. I remember one morning when I started going into
weird head trips and off on angry, frustrated mental tangents, and then I just happened to notice
the clock on the wall, and see what time it was. Then I suddenly remembered that I was
overdue to change the patch and put a fresh one on. I was going into nicotine withdrawal
because the patch was exhausted. The new patch fixed things, and I calmed down.
<p>
Still, I was only on the patches for about two weeks. I quickly switched down
to weaker and weaker patches. And then one morning I wondered what would
happen if I just didn't put another patch on. I could always put another
patch on if things got bad, but I wanted to see where things were at now.
It was okay. I didn't flip out. I still got cravings occasionally, but
they were manageable. That's all I ever asked for &#8212; manageable.
And that was that. And I haven't had a patch or a cigarette since, and
that was 10 years ago.

<p>
Good luck on your quitting. It really is worth it. It's like a whole new life.
You are so much healthier, and you can smell and taste things. And you smell better to other
people too. And you don't have chronic headaches.
And you don't have to spend money on cigarettes. And you don't have to be constantly getting
another smoke break. (Oh, and for more incentives, you could read my web page on
<a href="orange-tobacco.html" target="_blank">Tobacco</a>.)

<p>
I found that after I quit, I just could not sit around and do nothing physically any more. I just had to
get out and about. So I went for long walks up and down the river, and that's when I discovered the
Canada Geese and fell in love with them. So I ended up sitting down at the river and watching the
geese, and working on my suntan, and drinking ginger ale, and playing the guitar.
The geese are tone-deaf and don't care about music at all, but they love bread.
And their children really flip over sweet sticky cinnamon rolls.
If bread is mana from Heaven, sweet sticky cinnamon rolls are the food of the Gods.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

Hello again Orange,

Since I last emailed you I found a link to a group which Tom Powers and his
son may have had a part in founding, namely All Addicts
Anonymous
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160617200826/http://www.alladdictsanonymous.org/" target="_blank">

<p>
Take it for what it is worth, but it gives a little more info on what
happened to Powers after the split with Wilson.    I would like to know a
little more about its early days, so I'll keep digging.

<p>
They say chasing the Deity can drive one to insanity and  apart from the
apocryphal demise of Mr. Powers senior, I find his &quot;First Questions...&quot; book
to be quite well  written and his instructions on how to get started in the
spiritual life relevant to my own situation.  By the way I misinformed you
of his second book.  I think it was called &quot;Invitation to a Great
Experiment&quot;.

<p>
And a job well done on preventing Agent Orange from being disposed of in the
USA.  Who would have known?   Symptoms of poisoning took about 30+ years to
show up in my case and the VA hospitals seem to be doing the right thing.

It takes ten seconds and costs $10 &#8212; A lot cheaper than a doctor.&quot;

<p>
So, Bob deposits a urine sample in a small jar and takes it to Wal-Mart.

<p>
He deposits $10, and the computer lights up and asks for the urine sample.
He pours the sample into the slot and waits.
10 seconds later, the computer ejects a printout:

<p>
<blockquote>
You have tennis elbow.<br>
Soak your arm in warm water and Epsom salts<br>
found on aisle2,<br>
Avoid heavy activity.<br>
It will improve in 2 weeks.<br>
Thank you for shopping @ Wal-Mart.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
That evening, while thinking how amazing this new technology was, Bob began
wondering if the computer could be fooled.

<p>
He mixed some tap water,
a stool sample from his dog,
urine samples from his wife and daughter,
and a sp*rm sample for good measure.

<p>
Bob hurries back to Wal-Mart, eager to check the results.
He deposits $10, pours in his concoction,
and awaits the results.

<p>
The computer prints the following:

<p>
<blockquote>
1. Your tap water is too hard.<br>
Get a water softener. (Aisle 9)<br>

<p>
2. Your dog has ringworm.<br>
Bathe him with anti-fungal shampoo.<br>
(Aisle 7)<br>

<p>
3. Your daughter has a cocaine habit.<br>
Get her into rehab.<br>

<p>
4. Your wife is pregnant.<br>
Twins. They aren't yours.<br>
Get a lawyer.<br>

<p>
5. If you don't stop playing with yourself,<br>
your elbow will never get better!<br>
Thank you for shopping @ Wal-Mart<br>

&quot;Hi orange hope you are well. I had a random thought:
the 12 steppers love to parrot on
about how addiction is a brain based disease. If that were the case and we did have a

and have scans to determine this?? Just a thought would love your feedback on
this.

I once said to somebody who believes the disease nonsense that &quot;would you feel

Hi again Jamie,
<p>
Thanks for the note, and the thought. And that brings up a similar question:
&quot;Why isn't there a medical test for alcoholism?&quot;
<p>
I mean a real test, where they analyze your blood or your urine or your genes, and determine
whether you are &quot;a real alcoholic&quot;. Why not? They can test for just about every disease and
genetic abnormality imagineable now, but no test for alcoholism other than stupid questionaires that ask
if you drink too much alcohol?
<p>
One hundred thousand U.S. citizens die from alcohol consumption every year,
and another 10,000 or 13,000 die from fatal automobile accidents involving alcohol.
That makes &quot;alcoholism&quot; one of the deadlier &quot;diseases&quot;
in America, and yet, there is no actual medical test to determine if somebody has the &quot;disease&quot;?
<p>
Of course the truth is that there is no medical test for
&quot;alcoholism&quot; because there is no such &quot;disease&quot;
as &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Orange.

<p>
This is funny and typical. So my girl friend's daughter I wrote you about
who needed to go outside of Toronto to get rehab because she said she
couldn't do it here. The guy who runs the joint took her in and said, &quot;she
pulled at his heart strings.&quot; Then my girlfriend had to call him and tell
him she would be a little late in sending him the first $3000.00. The guy
freaked and said, &quot;What do you mean, this is a good damn business not a
charity case. I'll be sending her home on a plane tonight. I wouldn't even
do this for my own kids.&quot;
<p>
So my girlfriend called him back and said, &quot;If you
kick her out I will have the T.V. stations on your facility, the ombudsman
etc.&quot;
<p>
He backed down and didn't make the daughter leave. But now the daughter is
saying &quot;I don't think I am ready to leave, I'm scared&quot; So her boyfriend is
trying to get a $10,000.00 loan to keep her in there longer. Now this place
has a sauna, spa, 52 inch T.Vs in every room. Who would want to come home
and face responsibility? Plus she is saying this is my recovery and all the
A.A. jargon. You gotta love it, if it wasn't so sad and such a scam.

Hi I sent you another email about the continuing story of the rehab below.
My friend said her daughter would think she was too high class to go to A.A.
so I mentioned smart recovery, and suggestions from your website but she
said she didn't know what I was talking about and it was her daughter's own
journey to take from this point on. Good idea if only her mom would stick to

Wow. That's really a &quot;spiritual&quot; cure for a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;, isn't it?

They may well have put so much garbage in her head that she is genuinely afraid of what
will happen when she is out of the facility and on her own.
Convincing people that they can't make it on their own also convinces people that they got

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
Some additional sources that I hope you will find useful.  I found the
Dawson study particularly interesting.  It asserts that there is a stable
natural remission rate of approximately 20% of people who are diagnosed with
alcohol dependence. That is aproximately 20% of all people who decide I don't
want to drink out of control any more. About 2 out of 10 of them will
successfully do it for at least 5 years.  This rate is broken up into two types
of recovery Abstinate Recovery and Non-Abstinate Recovery.  The stable natural
Abstinate recovery rate is about 8% (Table 2 stable recovery rate * (1-%
treated)), while the treated recovery rate is about 6% (Table 2 stable recovery
rate * % treated).  If this information is helpful please include the references
to your studies in the effectiveness of AA section of your website.  If not than
don't.

P.S.  Though I love your work in about AA/NA, but I cannot help but notice you
have a free tibet logo on your website.  It's kind of a minor thing, but as it
turns out the Dali Lama is not the holier than though soothsayer he would have
you to believe.  Like many false gurus (i.e. Bill W), the Dali Lama demands and
aura of self sacrifise and dedication from his followers that he does not follow
himself.  Until the Chinese invaded Tibet, the Dali Lama and the Lama ruling
class goverened Tibet with and iron fist.  The Lamas lived in palatial mansions
while the peasants lived in squalor and were torture was common.  I'm not saying
Communist China is a walk in the park, but at least they introduced secular
education and some basic social reforms, which is more than the Dali Lama can
say.  Ultimately the Dali Lama just wants his slaves back.  Again I realize this
is a minor issue in comparison to the rest of your website.  Any way I
included a link to a Penn and Teller Bullshit Episode that sums it up quite
nicely.  It's a 3 part episode, containing information on Mother Teresa, Ghandi,
and the Dali Lama.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have to answer this without having seen the video, because ever since I upgraded Firefox,
videos won't play. I think it's a plugin problem. And I'm running Linux, which is the last
system that they ever fix their stuff for. Now Linux is just fine, and the creators and
maintainers of Linux are very quick about fixing bugs. But the people who supply things like
Flash or web browsers fix their stuff for Windows first, and the Mac next, and Linux last.
So I still can't see any videos.

<p>
In general, I am suspicious of negative publicity about the Dalai Lama, because most of it actually
comes from agents for the Chinese Communist leadership in Peking (Beijing?). They are constantly
slandering him.
They are really embarrassed by all of the negative publicity, and wish that the Lamas would all
just disappear.
<p>
I really like Penn and Teller, and they are often spot on. But they can be mistaken. And there is
plenty of misinformation and slander and libel about the Dalai Lama for them to find.
<p>
First off, the Dalai Lama never ruled Tibet with an iron fist. In fact, he
never ruled Tibet at all, not for one single day. He was only a boy, and a regent
ruled in his place. Then, before the Dalai Lama reached the age of majority, the
Chinese Army invaded, and from that day on, the Chinese Generals ruled Tibet with an
iron fist. The Tibetan society may well have had its faults, and poverty, but that
was not the fault of a boy who controlled nothing.

<p>
If the Dalai Lama was keeping all of his followers in slavery, why do they want him to come back?
The Dalai Lama is so popular in Tibet that the Chinese have outlawed even wearing a T-shirt
with the face of the Dalai Lama on it.

<p>
I judge the Dalai Lama mostly from his books that I have read. I don't see a tyrant there; rather,
a gentle soul. Personally, I wonder how he can handle the situation without hating the Chinese.
I would, if I were in his shoes.  He must have the patience of a saint.
<p>
What I do know is that the Chinese army has killed about a million Tibetans and destroyed
six thousand temples. And then they put a nuclear waste dump in Tibet.
What the Chinese are doing to Tibet is cultural genocide.
<p>
Speaking of which, that is why the Chinese have opened &quot;secular education&quot;. That is part of the
process of destroying the Tibetan culture. We all know what Communist &quot;education&quot; is like:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The nasty former rulers kept all of the poor people in slavery until the wonderful Communist
People's Liberation Army came and liberated them, and now everybody will live happily ever after.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Then the Chinese have kidnapped large numbers of Tibetan children and taken them to China,
where they are being taught how to be Chinese. That is exactly the same process as what was
done to Indian children here in the USA in the late eighteen-hundreds and early nineteen-hundreds.
Indian children were taken away from their parents and sent to &quot;Indian Schools&quot; where they were
taught to be little White Men, and they were beaten if they spoke their native language, and their
hair was cut and they were dressed as little white men, and taught how to be &quot;Christians&quot;...
The Chinese are doing the same things to the Tibetans, to get rid of the Tibetan culture.
Except that Chinese Communist education is viciously atheistic, so no Buddhism or Christianity
or any other religion is allowed there.


<p>
Have you read or seen &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;? That was written
by a German mountain climber, Heinrich Harrer, who got captured by the
British in India during World War II, and escaped from the prisoner-of-war
camp, and fled to Tibet, where he ended up being a close friend of the
Dalai Lama, who was at that time just a boy. In fact, Harrer had a big
part in educating the young Dalai Lama about the outside world, and
science, and all things Western. He portrays the Chinese invasion as a
disaster, not a liberation. &quot;Liberation&quot; is the word that the
Communists use.
<p>
Back in New Mexico, some friends of friends were followers of the Dalai Lama.
When the Dalai Lama visited them there about 20 years ago (before he became popular),
he refused to even take their cash donation (that they had worked so hard to scrounge up),
telling them to keep it and use it locally.
The Dalai Lama could see that they were not rich &#8212; they were actually living in poverty, by
the usual American standards &#8212; so he wouldn't take their money.
That just does not come across as being a greedy tyrant who lives in luxury at the expense of others.
</font>
<p>
Additionally I have included the link to the Penn and Teller Bullshit episode
about alcoholics anonymous.  It's mostly a repeat of the information you already
have, but I thought you might find it interesting.<br>

<h2>THE BUSINESS OF ADDICTION</h2>
 by joey spencer
</center>

<p>
The practice of addiction treatment facilities in the Watertown New York
area, of &quot;cutting short&quot; the treatment of addicts, at precisely the same
time as their insurance runs out, is reprehensible and detrimental to the
well being of the patient. In Watertown, there is a pervasive practice of
manipulating addicts while they are most vulnerable. There is the common
instances of coercing those with manageable addiction issues, into entering
unnecessarily into in-patient treatment facilities. Then there is the &quot;get
even&quot; attitudes of some addiction professionals. For instance, if the person
seeking treatment should have the audacity to retain independent thought,
and wish to take part in structuring his or her own treatment; they are
treated as though they are incapable of co-managing their own care. While
being presented with an attitude that is both callus and arrogant. According
to OASAS, NIDA, and the International Center for Advancement in Addiction
Treatment, (all of which are the foremost authorities on Addiction) The
single most decisive factor in creating a comprehensive recovery program
that is successful and permanent, is essentially empowering the patients in
their own healing process. However, it seems that in our region, some
ad-diction professionals are more concerned with being right, not having
their authority challenged, and filling the beds of in-patient treatment
facilities. They have struck up a symbiotic relationship with these
facilities,
with the goal of &quot;hording&quot; patients and their Medicaid insurance payments.
Instead of treating the patient with dignity and respect, they are treated
as a means of cash flow. Regardless of the well being of the patient, they
are coerced into treatment solely for the collection of Medicaid funds. This
practice ignores the welfare of the patient and focuses only on the
extrication of dollar amounts from the Medicaid program. This is happening
everyday at the Samaritan Behavioral Health out-patient care facility on
outer Washington street in Watertown. There is a sense of indifference
toward the concerns and input from patients. There is an attitude of
superiority, where every addict is looked at as unintelligent yet
manipulative. There is also the intolerance of independent thought. If a
patient has his or her own beliefs concerning spirituality, the disease
model of addiction, or the manner in which he or she would like to address
their issues. They are treated with distain not only by staff but by other
patients at the goading of staff. I have personally been told by staff, &quot;if
you do not find god then you will never stay clean.&quot; This of course is the
opinion of a single staff member and not the entire program. However, this
demonstrates the lack of respect for independent beliefs, and the audacity
of staff. This is a problem that needs the attention of someone who can
enforce state policy. And see through the staging of administration.

Every word of this is absolutely true for the services here in Watertown,

Hi again, Joey,
<p>
Thanks for the input.
<p>
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">The so-called &quot;treatment program&quot;
that I went through</a>
did the same thing &#8212; they kept me in an outpatient treatment program,
getting lectures from a cocaine-snorting pedophile, until the charges
had eaten up all of the money that the Oregon Health Plan would pay,
and then they &quot;graduated&quot; me. That is just standard operating
procedure.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	RE &#8212; One More Thing...From Jeffrey H.<br>

<p>
Hi Orange
<p>
Thank you so much for
<a href="orange-letters217.html#Jeffrey_H" target="_blank">setting Jeffrey H. straight</a>
about Christians and AA. There is
no way someone who has read the Bible and actually believes what it says could
continue to attend AA. The points you made are correct. It is false prophets, false
gods, and false religion. Also part of it (the twelve steps) were founded on a
sesssion with a Ouija board and a dead monk. That is witch craft at the very least.
Witch craft and sorcerers are spoken of in the Bible as well.

<p>
As far as I am concerned the Christains in AA are spinning Christianity in to what
they want to believe it is. Not for what the Bible says it is.

<p>
Now I've noticed Jesus Christ twelve step programs coming out the woodwork.
Celebrate Recovery comes to mind. I emailed them to ask them how they could adopt
something that came from a bella donna hullucination and a ouija board. No response
yet. Celebrate Recovery is just as bad, if not worse, as AA. It is AA masquerading
as Jesus Christ.

<p>
Keep on preaching the truth!

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Lisa

Hello again, Lisa,
<p>
Thank you for the good wishes. The most disturbing part of the situation that you described is
the &quot;no response&quot;. Jeffrey refused to read my answer too. I get the distinct feeling that
they don't really want to know the truth, and they don't want to talk about the truth.
They just want to hear their favorite superstitions repeated.
<p>
One of my favorite lines from Jesus is, &quot;Learn the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&quot;
I am a little bit amazed and appalled at how some people can rave about how they love Jesus,
and they are real Christians,
and then they stubbornly refuse to even go near looking at the truth.
<p>
Like
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#disconnect" target="_blank">Lafayette Ronald Hubbard taught his Scientologists</a>,

&quot;If criticism cannot be silenced, the Scientologist should should
cease all communication with the critic, and 'disconnect'.&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject: 	Me again<br>

<p>
Hi again Orange!

<p>
I was going through some letters to you yesterday, when I happened upon
<a href="orange-letters216.html#Sarah" target="_blank">Sarah's recent letter</a>
to you.... her statement...

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
My sponsor found out I was on medication and told me to stop taking it...
she then in an open meeting addressed me being on medication and the
meeting proceeded to be a SHIT ON SARAH FEST for being stupid to allow myself to
be medicated!!!!<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
disturbed me greatly. I am going to make an assumption here that poor
Sarah fell victim to the &quot;cult within a cult&quot; movement started by Clancy
Imislund from the Pacific Group... This (movement) group has tendrils all over
the U.S., from the Foxhall groups in Minnesota, Nebraska and Wisconsin... to the
D.C. group headed up by the now deceased Mike Q. (a Clancy
protege... sponsee).... and finally to the groups I got myself mixed up in out here in
Chicago.... One of them was the rigid and ridiculous &quot;Lemont Oaks&quot; group, along
with &quot;Oak Lawn Big Book&quot; (women were not allowed to wear pants to meetings,
men had to wear ties).... and last but not least the &quot;Between the Covers&quot;
and &quot;It's in the Book&quot; groups.... ALL of these meetings/groups got started
by men and women who were connected to that dirty rotten bastard Clancy
Imislund through sponsorship..... There is no one that this man will not
sponsor..... He breaks the rules and sponsors women.... Montana Carleen is one of
the women he has sponsored and SHE is responsible for the spread of this
nighmarish behavior of teaching her sponsees to play doctor out here in the
Midwest ...... Foxhall is FULL of Carleen/Clancy sponsees, along with the
other groups I previously mentioned....

<p>
We literally paid homage to this weirdo Carleen once a year. All of her
little sheep traveled to Montana to hear her speak. IT WAS MANDATORY..... WE
HAD TO GO!! ... If we wanted to stay in this elite line of
sponsorship.... Sound culty enough for you?? You want to hear something really
really sick??
<p>
I went to this Montana &quot;gathering&quot; the weekend my husband and I were moving
to a new house. Yep, I was more afraid of disobeying orders from on high
than I was of leaving my husband and kids to move everything out all on
their own! I still can't believe I did that!

<p>
The crap these people taught about medication was reprehensible. I stopped
taking medication after MY sponsor called me out on my Prozac.... I was
shamed into stopping it. I was informed by her, and several other pseudo-aa
doctors, that I would never get the &quot;message&quot; if my mind was clouded with
anti-depressants. Fortunately I had not been on it for too long.... so I really
did not have any serious problems..... oh yeah... I forgot.... I drank
about a week after I stopped the meds. Of course I was told that the relapse
was ALL MY fault because I wasn't working the &quot;program&quot;. It had NOTHING to do
with the cessation of my DOCTOR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION.

<p>
This all happened to me back in the mid nineties.... I know this is when
the infestation of Clancy clones began its spread across the country. I am
very disturbed to see it is still going strong. I left AA completely about
four years ago, but unfortunately had to endure many years of bullshit and
suffering before I escaped.

<p>
Believe it or not... even though I had left the cult I could not shake the
feeling that maybe, just maybe they were right about all of this stuff.
Maybe I had failed to work the program.... Then, when  I was recently
diagnosed with Adult ADD, my life-long struggles with LIFE made more sense!!...

<p>
Now it makes complete sense that the Prozac had been helping me......

<p>
Today I have to take ADD meds and anti-depressants.... Had I stayed in AA
I never would have discovered this. Looks like Clancy is still out there
shouting from the rooftops to all of his little clones that medication is
wrong.... bad bad bad..... I watched people die because of the anti-med
propaganda being thrown at people like Sarah and myself.

<p>
This evil web of Clancy clones is very very dangerous. I am happy to see
that Sarah got out..... Still, the most disturbing thing for me is
this...... Our Government.... the courts.... the media.... ordinary people, really
believe this shit works..... The whole world has been hoodwinked by the AA
machine.

<p>
Clancy I. is crazy.... crazy like a fox. He has built a huge network of AA
Nazis... and no one questions him or these groups and the damage they have
done over the years. The courts still keep ordering folks into
treatment..... and the sad thing is once they are branded with the scarlet &quot;A&quot;.... it
is
very difficult to get any doctor or psychiatrist to take someone who has
been branded an alcoholic seriously..... We are always under scrutiny, and are
most often accused of being in &quot;denial&quot;..... SO many Doctors
believe... &quot;Oh, you are just another lying sack of shit alcoholic out here drug
seeking&quot;.... Those in the medical establishment have been brainwashed and corrupted
by the AA logic... Many won't look any further than the initial alcoholism
diagnosis..... They don't seem to find it necessary to screen for an
underlying condition that might be causing someone to abuse alcohol.

<p>
Fortunately, I found a physician who believed in me.... but I know there
are millions out there just like me, who are being herded into the rooms by
doctors who have been corrupted by the AA/ Treatment Center mantra .... AA
IS the only way .... Yep that good old &quot;spirituality&quot; will cure EVERYTHING!!!

<p>
Oh well.... keep up the good work.... and Sarah.... good luck!

Hello again, Renee,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
That story is appalling, and yet, I'm sure that it's true. I've been hearing a lot about
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy's cult</a> over the years.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are free and feeling better now. Congratulations on your escape
from the looney bin.

<p>
Coincidentally, I got a spreadsheet from the Foxhall Group in Omaha, Nebraska,
 that purported to show that it
was a great success, sobering up hundreds and keeping them sober for years. But what the
numbers really showed was that the Foxhall Group was a total failure with nearly a 100%
dropout rate. You can see it

<p>
Have a good day now.
