I have but 1 question? How did you come up with
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="newwin84">the 31 questions to test
for a cult</a>?

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hi Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the question.
<p>
I'm not sure which way you mean that &#8212; why 31, or why those particular
questions?
<p>
(Note that, in the year since you wrote that question, the 31 questions
have become 100.)
<p>
Well, first off, 31 was just how many items I had when I started writing that
cult test.
<p>
Why those particular questions? Well, it started with an article that
I read about 20 years ago, I think in <i>The Utne Reader</i>, or
maybe <i>Mother Jones</i>.
Whatever magazine it was,
they had an issue that was devoted to cults and failed gurus and disillusioned
followers. They had a cult test that consisted of just 10 questions.
I could only remember the first five:

<ol>
<li> The guru is always right.
<li> You are always wrong.
<li> No exit.
<li> No graduates.
<li> Cult-speak.
</ol>
<p>
Then I just took it from there. I read
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cults" target="newwin85">a lot of books about cults</a>,
and collected items, and expanded the list.
I also drew upon my own memories of involvement with cults in the
nineteen-sixties and -seventies. So the list was 31 items the first
time I published it.
<p>
But then more things kept showing up and
occurring to me, so eventually, I bit the bullet and rewrote the list
and expanded it to 100 questions. Even that number is arbitrary. I still have
a few more good items that would expand it to 105 or so,
but right now, I'm content with a nice round number like 100.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	RE: AA<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I accidentally came across some of your writings by way of Google. I am so very glad
that I did. I am very new to AA (57 days) and have found one source of
disappointment after another.

<p>
So many broken men and women who tell me things that just are not any of their
business and so many examples of characters who try telling me what it is that I am
thinking and feeling that I hardly find a meeting wherein I don't bridle against
people who seem to not know how to think for themselves.

<p>
I guess it is the brain washing that I find offensive. I have a very short history
of moderate drinking that I caught very early on as becoming problem drinking. I
have been told that my brain is pickled and that I can't think for myself. The truth
is, I am struggling due to major depression. There are so very few people in AA who
seem to understand that one can be seriously ill, emotionally and need a great deal
of help without the dogma of AA.

<p>
What I need to do is separate the aspects of AA that I can use from the junk that I
just don't need. I am very glad that I came across your writings in that I have
found a voice that seems to be in touch with the reality that I have always known
prior to entering into AA. For that I thank you.

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
After 32 years in AA &#8212; I got so much pleasure from your analyses,lambasting one
man's stats. &#8212; and the coming forth with an academic torrent of your own &#8212; a real
laugh.
<p>
I am extremely happy to be one of the small percentage you mention &#8212; and have been
able to help others &#8212; oh, and as for the numbskull Bush in his &quot;protected
environment&quot; &#8212; who cares? Only in America as they say!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello  Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. It is good that you are sober and healthy, and
it would be nice to believe that you are helping others. But if
by &quot;helping&quot;, you mean that you are introducing alcoholics
to the 12-Step program, then that is a problem.
<a name="tests"> </a>
 There
is zero evidence that the A.A. program helps alcoholics.
Rather, the evidence is that the A.A. program does serious harm to
alcoholics. Involvement in A.A. has been shown to:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin21">raise the rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin22">raise the rate of rearrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin23">increase the costs of hospitalization later</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin24">raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<li> And although this has not been formally tested and measured,
the evidence is growing that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">A.A. also raises
the suicide rate in alcoholics</a>.
</ol>
<p>
So if we are really going to help alcoholics, we have to come up with
something better than A.A.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;David P.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	What is Your Point about Bill W<br>

<p>
I hated the thought of AA when I went into the program and wanted no
part of this &quot;cult&quot;  Much of that bias against the &quot;cult&quot; was based on
your writings that I assiduously reviewed in my state of denial.
<p>
Finally, having failed at Moderation Management and &quot;my&quot; program, I
tucked my tail between my legs and joined the cult.  My life has changed
and every day is better.
<p>
For your information, it is well known in the program that Bill W was a
sex addict, the subject of another fellowship (slaa).  The bottom line
is that as unwieldy as 12 step is, it is the best and only thing going
that helps drunks live sober.  Sure, it is a primitive set of morals but
what difference does it make that the founder was a brutish, sexist
hypocrite.  The end justifies the means.  You sound like an atheist
drunk with a bad case of sour grapes.  I used to be just like that.
<p>
Thanks God I know go to meetings every day, pray,. have a sponsor, have
a higher power (that I call HP, having no clue what or who &quot;god is&quot;) a
therapist, and psychiatric medication.  I was so postiive that I was not
an alcy that I started neurofeedback to &quot;cure&quot; it.  I had an EEG done
and sure enough, my addicted brain showed up in black and white.
<a name="hope_u_find"> </a>
Thank God for Bill W, warts and all.  I hope you find your own serenity some day.

<font color="blue">
Hello David,
<p>
Thank you for a suspicious piece of propaganda.
<p>
There is no EEG test that shows &quot;the addicted brain&quot; in black and white.
Do you even know what an EEG is?
<p>
Hint: What an EEG produces is a bunch
of squiggly lines that look like oscilloscope traces.
An EEG (Electro-Encephalograph) is a graph of the instantaneous
voltages at various points on the scalp, which shows the firing of bunches
of neurons in the underlying parts of the brain.
There is no picture of &quot;the addicted brain&quot;. Just squiggly lines.
There is no squiggly line that says, &quot;This guy has an addicted brain,
and he needs to be a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;
The only thing that an EEG could possibly show is, if you are going into convulsions
from Delerium Tremens and acute alcohol withdrawal, the EEG will show that.


<p>
Is the rest of your letter equally untrue or inaccurate?

<p>
You say that you pray to a &quot;Higher Power&quot; that you don't call &quot;god&quot;
(lower-case 'g'), because
you don't know what It is? Then how do you know that your
made-up &quot;Higher Power&quot; can really
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="newwin85">do miracles
and save you</a>?
How do you know that It will even bother to
answer your prayers, whatever It is? Why should It?
Do you pay &quot;Higher Power&quot; to work for you?
(And what do you pay It with? Silver? Gold? First-born sons? Your soul?)
<p>
You say that you don't know what &quot;Higher Power&quot; is,
and yet you presume to know how to manipulate &quot;Higher Power&quot;
and get It to do what you want, like keep you sober, and
restore you to sanity, and take care of 
your will and your life for you, and remove your moral shortcomings and
defects of character, etc.
Where did you get the magical knowledge of how to get unknown &quot;Higher Powers&quot;
to do all of that stuff for you?
<p>
I mean, you were made a born alcoholic, weren't you? And wasn't that
the Will Of Higher Power?
And Higher Power let you drink for years and years, didn't It?
That was the wish of Higher Power too, wasn't it? It must have been,
because you supposedly had no choice in the matter.
H.P. made you powerless over
alcohol, didn't It, so that was Its Plan, not yours, wasn't it?
But the minute you walked into an A.A. meeting, you suddenly got the 
magical ability to incant certain words 
(<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Dear Higher Power, Please gimme, gimme, 
gimme... Gimme sobriety, gimme power...&quot;</i></font>)
and suddenly Higher Power has to do what you wish, and change 
Its Divine Plan to agree with yours.
How does that differ from demonology, summoning up spirits and getting 
them to do your bidding?

<p>
Speaking of demons, how do you know that you aren't praying to one?
You said that you don't call your &quot;Higher Power&quot; &quot;god&quot; because you don't know
what it is. So it could be anything, like a lying little monster who tells you 
that bad moral standards are really okay. You can't protest that your &quot;Higher Power&quot;
is a good being, because you just said that you don't even know what it is.
(And remember that Bill Wilson bragged that
<a href="orange-heresy.html#evil_spirits" target="newwin90">he made contact
with all kinds of evil spirits during his s&eacute;ances</a>.)
 
<p>
Such attitudes are way beyond dubious theology. It sounds like you are wallowing
in self-indulgent superstition.  Good luck.
<p>

Speaking of theology, I'm not an atheist either. That is such a standard
Stepper cheap shot &#8212; accusing critics of being atheists. Can't you do
better than that?

<p>
Lastly, you actually rationalize questionable moral standards?
What kind of spirituality is that?<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;The end justifies the means.&quot;</font>
(That is a standard cult characteristic.
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_end_justifies" target="newwin56">
Look here</a>.)<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Sure, it is a primitive set of morals but
what difference does it make that the founder was a brutish, sexist
hypocrite.&quot;<br>
</font>
Well, it makes a big difference.  Especially when you discover that
&quot;The Founder&quot; was lying, and that his program is just
some old cult religion trash that he copied from another fake holy man
and sold to the suckers so that he never had to work a straight job
again.

<p>
Oh, and A.A. is not
<a href="orange-letters87.html#Miller" target="newwin57">the only thing that works</a>.
In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin88">it doesn't work
at all</a>.
The fact that you enjoy participating in a cult religion
does not necessarily make it a good sobriety program.

<p>
Have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Taking them On<br>

<p>
Orange,
Thanks to you &amp; your website I am &quot;taking on&quot; the local recovery industry army in my
bucolic county of Hunterdon, NJ. Here's a letter to the editor to a local paper. I
stole some stuff from you, but I know you won't mind and it's all for the greater
good. Now, if we could get more people to write letters to the editors, and to their
congress-people, etc....



<p>

<table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Letter to the Editor:

<p>
I'm responding to a letter about Heath Ledger by Koren Rife, who wrote on behalf of
the &quot;dedicated experts&quot; at Seabrook House. Mr. Rife worries
[that] those [people] whose family
members are suffering from substance abuse &quot;won't know where to get help&quot; for their
loved ones because the truth of Ledger's life will have been glossed over. He warns
us that the most important thing to remember about Heath Ledger is that he abused
drugs. This is so typical of the recovery industry's contempt for the very people
they purport to want to help.

<p>
People know where to get help. Unfortunately, 93% of the time the help they will get
will be a 12-step oriented program like the one offered at Seabrook House and at
local halfway houses near you. Programs like AA foisted on vulnerable patients by
the courts, employers, and ignorant counselors are useless, ineffective, and in fact
contraindicative. I speak from personal knowledge on both sides of this issue.

<p>
Until a family member gets shoved into one, most people have no idea of what their
loved one is getting into. The 12-step program claims the person abusing the
substance has a &quot;spiritual&quot; disease and therefore must seek a &quot;spiritual solution.&quot;
Each step is supposed to help one attain the required spiritual awakening.

<p>
Except that the 12-step program is more like a religious cult than a spiritual
awakening. Oh, members crow about it being &quot;spiritual&#8212;not religious,&quot; but in fact
the following courts have ruled that Alcoholics Anonymous is a religious
organization: the Federal 7th Circuit Court in Wisconsin, 1984; the Federal District
Court for Southern New York, 1994; the New York Court of Appeals, 1996; the New York
State Supreme Court, 1996; the Tennessee State Supreme Court; the Federal 2nd
Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, 1996; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit; the U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh District, 1996; the Federal
Appeals Court in
Chicago, 1996; and even the U.S. Supreme Court, 1997.

<p>
The reason the courts reached this decision is because a) people were complaining
about having their religious rights violated by being shoved into a religious
organization like AA as a condition of probation or sentencing, and b) they didn't
want to have to attend a program that was not only ineffective but actually
dangerous.

<p>
Hopefully more courts will agree with the above and maybe this tragic practice will
be stopped. If AA didn't have the courts as recruiters, the program would have very
very few believers still in it. So much for a &quot;program of attraction,&quot; as they like
to boast.

<p>
Multiple studies have shown AA's ineffectiveness:

<p>
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma (Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior, Medical College
of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia) found going to AA caused five times much binge
drinking as those not attending AA;

<p>
Dr. Keith Ditman, MD found in &quot;A Controlled Experiment on the Use of Court Probation
for Drunk Arrests&quot;, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry that AA
attendees were rearrested for drunkenness nearly twice as often as those had had not
attended AA, or who had not attended ANY treatment;

<p>
AA's own triennial studies conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:
81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days, 90% are gone in 3 months, and 95% are
gone after one year. That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%.
But AA does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before
quitting &#8212; they don't qualify as members. This is called &quot;cherry-picking.&quot; If those
were included however, then the numbers would be much worse, believe it or not.

<p>
The most damning evidence came from a current leader of Alcoholics Anonymous, Prof.
George Vaillant, who is a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
[World] Services, Inc. He found that AA was completely ineffective for getting
alcoholics to quit drinking, and the biggest effect of A.A. was to raise the death
rate in alcoholics. No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death
rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous. He called AA's death rate &quot;appalling.&quot;

<p>
Every year The Hunterdon County United Way donates money to a couple of local
halfway houses. This year it will be $24,000 to one and about $32,000 to the other.
Is this the best thing to do with the money given the studies listed above? By
giving to these AA recovery centers are we really doing right by the folks who need
help? Are we setting them up for bigger, more tragic failures down the road?  What
about the many local churches who think they are doing God's work by allowing AA
meetings to be held in their basements? I wonder if the local clergy realizes the
12-step program is heretical and actually anti-Christian.

<p>
The good news is most people quit their addictions on their own. It's called
&quot;spontaneous remission.&quot; Of course, the halfway houses/treatment centers will never
tell you that, as it is in their interest to keep the donations and grants flowing
in. They will tell you are completely powerless over your drinking or drugging.
Being surrounded by a group of people who keep telling you that you are powerless
over alcohol, and that your will power is useless, is not getting &quot;support&quot;. It is
getting sabotaged. There are other recovery options around like Women For Sobriety,
Rational Recovery, and SMART Recovery. And don't forget recovery groups around
called &quot;your family,&quot; and &quot;your friends.&quot;

<p>
Good luck to all of you who are trying to stop or at least slow down. You can do it.

Dear agent orange:

<p>
As a sober member of AA for 32 years, I have read some of your rants with
curiosity &#8212; not about your strange conclusions about the fellowship &#8212; but
about your own obvious pathology.  It is not what you say so much as it is  the
furious, almost hysterical tone.  Some of your criticisms of  AA, while
terribly exaggerated, distorted and twisted, have some basis in  fact.  There are
peculiarities about AA that I myself find troublesome and  even harmful.  But you
are simply throwing a tantrum about AA, and one  wonders why.

<p>
Let me just say this:  I had a lot of trouble getting sober.  I  was an
agnostic, and in many fundamental ways I still am.  I came into AA  in 1976 because
I simply didn't know where else to turn.  I fancied myself  to be an
intellectual because of my unusually high IQ.  I did a lot of  sneering. I thought AA
was &quot;quaint.&quot;  I scoffed at a lot of what I  heard in those early days.  And
yet, here I am, having recently celebrated  my 32nd AA anniversary.  I am
married to an alcoholic who has but ten days  less sobriety than I.  I have a host
of friends in the fellowship.  I  have helped found five different AA groups
and seen all of them grow and  flourish. I attend meetings regularly of a group
for AAs who have 30 years  or more in the program, and it is attended by as
many as 40 men and women, many  of whom I have known since I first came into AA.

<p>
I have heard, and still hear, things in AA that I disagree with  profoundly.
There are many &quot;holes&quot; in the literature regarding the origin  of the
illness, and many inconsistencies in Bill Wilson's ramblings about  recovery,
particularly in the book 12 Steps and 12 Traditions.  But there  is also an enormous
amount of wisdom and common sense there too.  And the  steps themselves are as
simple and direct as a set of instructions for building  a Leggo tractor.
There is nothing sinister or even mysterious about  them. And in spite of your
insistence (and reliance on a series of flawed  studies) that &quot;AA doesn't
work,&quot; I have spent my entire 32 years in AA in one  city, where I have attended at
least 35 or 40 different groups, and I  have seen it work, first-hand.  And
as a board member of our local  council on alcohol and drug abuse, I have heard
the testimony of doctor after  doctor, therapist after therapist, who praise
AA for its high success rate and  who have witnessed none of the baleful
results you claim occur.

<p>
I have attended literally thousands of AA meetings, and have spoken in AA
hundreds of times.  I have spent thousands of hours talking to fellow AAs  and
listening to them talk. There are oddballs in AA, showoffs, grandstanders,  con
artists, sexual predators.  There are also doctors, lawyers, judges,
accountants, school teachers, corporate CEOs, atheist college professors,  ministers
and the occasional priest, social workers, nurses, members of the  military,
PhD psychologists, computer software designers, used car salesmen,
ex-convicts, massage therapists, ad men and women, radio and television  performers
and
executives.  I have found no one in AA whom I  believed to be deluded or
captive of some sinister cult.  The most normal  people, the kindest people, the
most generous people, the funniest people, and  the brightest, most imaginative
people I have ever known I have met in AA.   And they are also the people in my
life that I love the most, and who love me  too.  Oh, yes, and they are the
happiest people I have ever known.

<p>
And then, I run across you and your weird web site and your  raging hatred of
AA and I wonder where this boiling resentment came  from.  And I compare you
with those hundreds and thousands of AAs I have  met and loved over all these
years, who went on those 12 step calls and came to  the meetings and helped
others in ways far beyond sobriety, and the contrast is  so stark and vivid as
to be the difference between Dante's inferno and a  walk in the park on a day
in spring.  You are obviously living in some sort  of hell of your own making,
and for that I am sorry for you.  I don't  really think you do AA any harm,
although that is clearly your  intent.  But I do hope you find peace somehow,
and escape from this  obsession that seems to torture you and consume you.

Hello CW,
<p>
Okay, I let you go on and on and deliver your speech.
<p>
There is not a single number there, in all of your rap,
nor any actual evidence that A.A. works to make alcoholics quit drinking.
It's all Frank Buchman's
favorite trick of vague,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#undisprovable" target="newwin91">Undisprovable Statements</a>, like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Senior military men in America have realized the necessity...&quot;</font>, and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;An American General told Frank Buchman two years ago...&quot;</font>
<p>
It's all fluff without any actual facts that can be verified.

<p>
Do you have any hard evidence, rather than hear-say?
<p>
Oh, and of course you are using a couple more of the standard Steppers' debating
techniques, like
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="newwin91">
<i>ad hominem</i></a>, and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="newwin91">I'm listing my shortcomings, but I'm really talking about you</a>.&quot;</font>
But that kind of just comes with the territory, doesn't it?

<p>
Dear agent orange:

<p>
I didn't address the foolishness of the recovery rate mythology, but will  go
into detail later.  Most of the studies you cite have long been  dismissed as
deeply flawed, including the Vaillant study that you rave about so  often.  A
recent 27 page research paper of AA recovery rates shows that the  old
numbers &#8212; 50% and 25% &#8212; still are valid today by any reasonable  measure.

<p>
Meanwhile, these macro numbers are at least entertaining.  It is  estimated
that there are 17,500,000 alcoholics in the United States (out of 45  million
&quot;problem&quot; drinkers).  It is estimated that only 15% of the  alcoholics will
seek treatment, or 2,625,000.  AA has 1,200,000 members in  the U.S., about 46%
of the total who seek treatment.  And you say &quot;AA  doesn't work?&quot;  What have
you been smoking?

<p>
More later.

<p>
CW

<p>
<font color="blue">
A &quot;recent research paper&quot;? You mean a piece of propaganda that is designed to
fool the unwary?

<p>
The only thing that produces valid results is properly-conducted
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>.
That is, real controlled tests.
<p>
&quot;Papers&quot; that try to contrive an
A.A. success rate of 25% or 50% are frauds, and nothing more.

<p>
By the way, what is the name of this &quot;recent research paper&quot;, and who wrote it,
and where was it published?  Leaving out that information is a glaring omission.
<p>
The rest of your argument is just the usual minimization and denial tap-dance &#8212;
<font color="black">&quot;the A.A. recovery rate mythology&quot;</font>.
It isn't mythology, it's the facts.
The mythology is the often-incanted lie about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;</font>, and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...50% got sober at once, and remained
that way; 25% sobered up after some relapses&quot;
</font>
(<i>Big Book</i>, page XX of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions)

<p>
You have not produced any actual facts to
support your belief that A.A. works to make alcoholics quit drinking.
Casually mentioning, without naming, some
paper that allegedly says something, is not even hear-say evidence.

<p>
I can't let this line go without comment:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Oh really? <font color="black">&quot;...have long been dismissed...&quot;</font>
That is the propaganda trick of
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#passive_voice" target="newwin25">Use of the Passive Voice</a></i>,
where all kinds of things allegedly get done by invisible, unnamed people.

<p><li> So precisely <i>who</i> &quot;dismissed&quot; those studies, besides some angry Steppers who
don't like the results of the tests, and wish that those inconvenient truths
would just go away?
Who says that those studies are &quot;deeply flawed&quot;, and what do they know?
Flawed how? Please provide some citations or references to something valid and authoritative.

<p><li> Your claim that <i>most of</i> the valid clinical tests of A.A.'s effectiveness
are &quot;dismissed as deeply flawed&quot; is the propaganda trick of
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#spurious_deligit target=" newwin35">Spurious Deligitimization of Evidence</a></i>. You have provided no evidence that any of those tests or
studies is flawed.

<p><li> And you said, &quot;most of&quot;. So which tests are still considered valid?
You didn't say. You imply that the tests that you don't like are the 
&quot;dismissed&quot; ones, but you didn't really say which tests 
you consider flawed, and which are okay, did you?

<p><li> And what new, superior, better-done tests &#8212;
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a> &#8212;
gave better results from A.A. treatment? And what doctors did those tests?
Please be very specific. I want names, dates, publications, and page numbers.
I showed you mine, now show me yours.
</ol>


<p>
This paragraph
is particularly interesting because it demonstrates your lack of working logic:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
	It is  estimated
that there are 17,500,000 alcoholics in the United States (out of 45  million

seek treatment, or 2,625,000.  AA has 1,200,000 members in  the U.S., about 46%
of the total who seek treatment.  And you say &quot;AA  doesn't work?&quot;  What have
you been smoking?
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
You have presented zero evidence that any A.A. members are sober, or that A.A. works. 
<ul>
<li> You threw out a few numbers: the number of estimated alcoholics
in the USA, and how of them many seek treatment, apparently ever seek treatment
at any time in their lives.
<li> Then you gave an unverified A.A. membership count. There is
no official membership list, and they cannot eliminate duplicates.
They can't even tell who is just visiting, or who dropped out after three or four meetings.
<li> Then you claimed that the A.A. membership was roughly equal to half of the
number of alcoholics who seek treatment sometime in their lives.
So what?
<li> Then you merely <i>assumed</i> that some or all of those A.A. members 
were sober, and claimed that A.A. works.
There is no actual evidence of any sobriety there. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zippo.<br>
You just assumed the very thing that you were trying to prove &#8212; that A.A. works
to sober up alcoholics. That's the propaganda trick of
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="newwin27"><i>Petitio Principii</i>, Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a></i>.
<li> Nor did you provide anything like a
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin08"><i>sobriety rate</i></a>
&#8212; like
what percentage of the newcomers get 5 or 10 or 20 years of sobriety
&#8212; that would reveal how well the A.A. program really works.
<li> And you think that is an argument that proves that A.A. works?
What have <i>you</i> been smoking?
</ul>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hey Orange.

<p>
My name is Gerard, I'm 28, started AA at about... 22 and broke free maybe a year
ago, and I would like to say that I enjoy alot of what you post; you seem kinda bent
on what... I don't exactly know what your &quot;primary purpose&quot; would be? But I hope you
don't feel angry at them, or, any other thing on your psyche; I know that I did for
too long, then, studied the teachings of emptiness in madhyamika school of Buddhism,
and saw how things operate in reality, so, not to much to do with AA as its own
singular cause; you attended for some time, I attended for some time, we both were
there, so, we both are why things are the way they are to some extent! care to
differ?

<p>
So, you may say thats not enough? Maybe? So then look to particle physics and see
that everything is one substance, and absolutely nothing done was done by a do-er!

<p>
If you understand what I am saying here then you could see that as fast as you want
to waste time with how you view AA, or, all your views on how things are happening
according to you is as fast as I could deconstruct your entire website with less
than a thought (but who is thinking anyway, yes?)

<p>
You could run even deeper if you wanted?? Anyways? ... I heard of documentation of
proof that the authors of the BB had relapsed after writing it somewhere down the
road, if you have that could you let me know?

<p>
Thanks,

Hello Gerard,
<p>
While this may all just be a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago
(Grateful Dead song there), the suffering of our fellow humans (and other sentient beings)
is real. So, after we get out of our own kharmic predicaments,
we are stuck with the job of reducing their suffering.
One way to do that is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of this
planet &#8212; that is, the truth to noise ratio.
<p>
Telling the truth about alcoholism, addiction, and recovery, and how
well various things work to help people to get free and sober, is a
small part of the job.  It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.
<p>
I have no documentary evidence that either Bill Wilson or Dr. Bob relapsed
after writing the <i>Big Book</i>, just
<a href="orange-letters67.html#Wilson_drunk" target="newwin93">unconfirmed reports from
various people</a> that Bill Wilson relapsed all of the time.

<p>
Have a good day.
<p>
== Orange
<p>
P.S.: I see that I forgot to answer your question about <i>Big Book</i>
authors relapsing. Yes, that is documented. Bill Wilson's wife, Lois
Wilson, had a personal secretary named Francis Hartigan. He wrote a
biography of Bill Wilson named
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hartigan" target="newwin99"><i>Bill W.
A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i></a>.

Hartigan wrote that Bill Wilson kept the first copy of the
<i>Big Book</i> that came off of the presses, and in that book, Bill
ticked off the names of the authors of the autobiographical stories
who relapsed. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We have to wonder why both the Wilsons and the Smiths did not simply give up.
Today the nation's best alcoholism treatment centers report success rates
ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent. During Bill's stay in Akron,
he and Bob calculated their success rate to be about 5 percent, and among
the few who seemed to catch on, not all of them were able to maintain
consistent sobriety. The first edition of AA's <i>Big Book</i>, published
in 1939, contains the personal recovery stories of many of AA's earliest
members. Some years later, Bill made notations in the first copy of the
book to come off the press, indicating which individuals portrayed therein
had stayed sober. A good 50 percent of them had not.<br>

<p>
Hi i'm an AA member in the UK and i agree about the dropout rate. From my experience
a lot of people come to meetings once or twice and thats it. But those who stay or
swallow there pride and return straight after a slip generally do quite well. I find
it works for those who are serious about quitting. I have also known people who quit
through willpower alone but they had to take anti craving drugs and seemed to have a
much tougher time for the first year with the support of AA.  I would say if anyone
is serious about quitting, go to AA and if you cannot take on board the steps just
do step one, and make use of the support.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Adrian,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I also find that &quot;those who are serious about quitting&quot; tend to do well.
Motivation and will power are very important for success in quitting bad habits.
That
has nothing to do with A.A., of course; A.A. just steals the credit when
one of those sincere, determined, motivated, people does quit drinking.
<p>
I don't know what people you are talking about who do worse without A.A. and
have to take &quot;anti-craving drugs&quot;. 
Do you have a citation, or any official report of that?
When was it ever established that A.A. is a substitute for &quot;anti-craving drugs&quot;?
<p>
I don't take any such &quot;anti-craving drugs&quot;, and never did &#8212; other
than the fact that I used nicotine patches for two weeks to quit smoking, at the same
time as I quit drinking.

Step One is not &quot;support&quot;, it is sabotage.

Hello Fury,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer. Sometimes the email really piles up and gets backlogged,
and this was one of those times. I'm just going back through old email, trying to
get caught up, and found this.
<p>
Obviously, the situation must have ended, one way or another, by now.
<p>
In general, getting a loved one out of a cult can be extremely difficult, if he or she
has really gone off the deep end, which it sounds like your wife did.
She's over 21 years of age, and free to do what she wishes, so legally, there is
not much that you can do.
<p>
A good source of advice for getting someone out of a cult is
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan"><i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i> by Steven Hassan</a>.
<p>
But still, there is no guaranteed cure or sure answer. Often, you have little choice
but to let them do what they think they have to do, and hope that they will
come to their senses and recover eventually.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I have studied your work for about 1-year now. I have relapsed many times. As of now
I'm sober 6-months. About 2-months ago I had one bottle of beer along with my wife
(she has no problem).
<p>
No monsters come after me, no string of events happened, etc... I just wanted to see
if Ol' Bill was right about one drink. I can safely say, in my case, he is wrong.
However, I do not think it a good idea to drink regularly, just a personal choice.

<p>
I cleared my head. Much of this was helped by your work. I want to take the time to
thank you from the bottom of my heart. I never write letters like this, but I feel
you deserve it. Please keep up your hard work. You are objective, non-partial, and
just. I have never caught you making not even one unfounded slander. I have read
most of your work.

<p>
My life is mine again to do As I choose.

<p>
 
Thanks for your papers,

<p>

Hi Marty,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments, and I'm glad to hear that you
have broken free and are doing well. It sounds like you have things figured out
very well indeed &#8212; one drink won't kill you, but you are better off if you don't.

<p>
So have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:<br>

<p>
Are you somebody who tried to get sober and couldn't?  What do you do for a
living?  You spend some much time in something that will really have very
little impact on society as a whole if any.  There are much more scandalous
things in this world than alcoholics anonymous.  Yet, you spend all your
time on this?  There must be something I'm missing.  There has to be a
reason why you devote so much to it.  Maybe a family member tried to get
sober and couldn't?  I have no idea.  If you could please respond I would be
very interested to know.
<p>
And yes.  I am someone who spent a lot of time in
and out of institutions.  I went to my first one when I was 12 for
depression.  Then later on I started going for drugs and alcohol abuse.
However I am now 14 months sober and life is good.  I have started to
rebuild relationships with my family.  I am self-supporting and happy.  And
this is as a result of alcoholics anonymous and a God of MY understanding.
Not yours or anyone else's in or out of AA.  So I don't want to hear about
how AA doesn't work or it's a cult or anything else negative you want to
say.  I am just curious as to why you spend so much time on the subject.
What happened?

Hello Justin,
<p>
I am not somebody who couldn't get sober. I am just seven weeks short of 9 years
sober now.  I tell the truth about alcoholism and recovery because somebody has
to do it.
<p>
The fact that you enjoy A.A. meetings does not make it a good or effective
method for helping alcoholics. And yes, there are bigger causes of death
than alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, but not many.
And quack cures &#8212; &quot;scandalous things&quot; &#8212;don't help anybody.

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
Dear orange:

<p>
Your site is excellent.  It is well written.  You deal very well with the AA zealots.
Some thoughts of mine:   AA is a placebo, when it &quot;works&quot;.   It may come to the same
thing, but involvment in AA may be a replacement habit.

<p>
I suspect that the hard core member ship is really low.  Just enough to keep it
going.  AA does need coercion to get attendees.  Most of those do attend are NOT
alcoholics &#8212; even as defined by AA.  Very few people with a drinking problem
fulfill the definition of alcoholic &#8212; as defined by AA.

<p>
People who stay in AA are there because they derive benefit from it.  For many, it
is their only real social outlet.  It gives them a sense of belonging and easy
answers.  Some stay from fear.
<p>
There is a lunatic fringe in AA:  program zealots; those with untreated
personality disorders.  It is they who send you the poison pen letters.

Hi anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the compliments.
<p>
About the size of the core group: I was kind of thinking the same thing.
The dropout rate is so high that the long-term core group cannot be very big.
Just today I was thinking about the big conventions where they get 5,000
or 10,000 people together and do a &quot;count-down of years&quot;, as
they call it, which is a routine where they recognize how much sober time
the old-timers have, and cheer for them.
<p>
Well, another letter that I
was answering today claimed that there were 1,200,000 A.A. members in the U.S.A.
(which I think is a little high, maybe way too high,
but we'll let that one slide for the moment).
Well, 10,000 is only 1/120th of 1,200,000.  So, at some gigantic convention where
they are celebrating the sobriety time of 10,000 old-timers,
they are actually cheering and bragging about
how much sober time 0.8% of their membership has.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
