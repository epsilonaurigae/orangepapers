Dear Mr. Orange,
<p>
You say that you have about 30 million hits per year on your site.  Cool.  Why do
you only get about $150-$200 dollars a year sent to you ?
<p>
Are your readers cheapskates or what ?  Heck, they have to have enough money to be

Hello again, Tom,
<p>
Well, I would guess that they have their own problems to deal with, like paying the rent
and taking care of the kids, and things like that. And donations are increasing. We may hit $300 or $400
this year. Which is good, because I have to get a better (more expensive) host than Hostmonster.com, which
has turned out to be a nightmare. (They are an overseller who promises everything to get you to sign up,
and then takes it all back in the fine print in the user agreement, and rules imposed later. Then they
overload each server with so many users that it slows to a crawl. Then their incompetent technicians
break things. Yes, I have to find a new host.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	RE: AA<br>

<p>
I would like to thank you for taking the time for helping to expose AA for
what it really is, a cult.  I am sure you probably receive a great deal of
mail, so I have been debating sending a lengthy detail of my terrible
experience with this group.

<p>
I agree that this group is a very dangerous and is responsible for many
deaths.   There is simply no substitute for proper medical treatment for
those suffering from mental illness.  When I was approached regarding the
various inventories, I immediately thought of the auditing process that
scientology employs.

<p>
It is unfortunate that this group has not been exposed on a larger scale.
It would be nice to expose this group to the mass media.  I am not certain
as to how this could be accomplished.  I am hopeful that you continue in
your efforts to expose this evil group, as it has devastated the lives of
so many.

<p>
If you are interested, I will send you a detailed account of my personal
experience.

<p>
Thank you,

Hello R.,
<p>
Thanks for the offer. Yes, I would very much like to get your story. I am collecting
A.A. Horror Stories so that other people will get some understanding of what might happen
to them in Alcoholics Anonymous. There is a list of previous stories here:
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">A.A. Horror Stories</a>.
<p>
So yes, I'd be happy to add your story to the list. And length is no problem. One of the
nice things about the World Wide Web is that we don't have to pay for blank paper.
<p>
Oh, and yes, there is a great deal of similarity between Scientology &quot;auditing&quot; and the A.A.
fourth and fifth Steps.  Both make the victim obsess with the past and fixate on what he
did wrong years ago, and constantly harp on what's wrong with him, which really messes with peoples' minds
after a while.  And that is also one of the standard cult characteristics:<br>

Subject:  	College student finishing up school<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I'm a college student at a large university on the east coast. I am 22
years old and I have suffered from anxiety/depression issues since the age
of 14/15. I started to realize I drank to deal with these emotions I was
feeling and I was no longer drinking to meet people or have fun. So, I
decided to join AA a little under two months ago.

<p>
Let me tell you that this has been one of the worst experiences of my life.
I actually just called my sponsor last night to tell her I was calling it
quits. Ever since I joined the program, my problems got worst, I fell
behind on my school work (I have a 3.5 at a well respected university), I
had a poor attitude at work, I began to have severe migraines, and I
suffered serious depression than I ever have before in my life.

<p>
I have been going to job interviews and I traveled this past weekend to go
to an interview and my sponsor just didn't get that I couldn't attend
meetings, work on my readings, work on the 4th step while I was gone. I was
there TO GET A JOB... that was my priority, not AA. It's like they expect
you to drop everything (which I sort of have) and hand your life over to
this program... and then they have all these answers as to why you're
feeling so miserable because of it. It's a scam and I am relieved that I
got out before it really ruined my last 5 weeks of a school that I have
loved dearly.

<p>
Thank you for making this website. It reinforced everything I was already
feeling about the program before. I am usually one to question everything
and wondered why I hadn't researched the AA program before entering the
room. But, when you're vulnerable/broken/depressed/etc. people (such as
myself) will listen to anything anyone tells them. I am glad I got out of
it sooner rather than later, completely brainwashed.

<p>
Have a great week, Orange!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Alix,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you have escaped from the madhouse.
<p>
Don't feel bad about not carefully researching A.A. before going there. Neither did I. All that I had
ever heard was that it was a wonderful self-help organization that helped people to get sober and stay
sober. Little did I know what the truth was. But I found out. And so did you.
<p>
So have a good day now, and a good life.

<p>
Agent Orange,

<p>
Thank you for your service, exposing the &quot;cult of  A.A.&quot; As defined and
expressed by NPR's Paul Harvey, one of the  most brilliant minds in
broadcasting history.

<p>
My questions: Why hasn't there been a class action law  suit of those
adversely affected by A.A. attendance? And, why hasn't there  been an
investigation into the prospects of RICO Act violations  predicated on alleged fraud
of
treatment, amateurish, at that,  constantly perpetrated across state lines
under the  guise of a Twelve Step Program of recovery?  A.A,  doesn't
maintain statistics of recidivism, because that would further  expose their
current and ongoing ineptitude.  &quot;Principles before  personalities&quot; as far as
their &quot;servants&quot; are concerned is a  ruse.

<p>
I was in the program, that began 42 years ago. And, at  that time, you
would not believe with whom I attended my first A.A.  Meeting. In retrospect, I
can't believe it.

<p>
So, if you'd be so kind, please let me know if you know of any  class
action law suits pending or ongoing.  Thank you.

Hello Billy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question. I don't know of any such lawsuits in progress now.
I am also mystified about why more people are not suing. I know that part of the reason is that
most down-and-out alcoholics cannot afford to pay a lawyer. Also, A.A. has cleverly structured its
organization in a pyramid of irresponsibility. They will always argue that it was your despicable
sponsor who did the bad things, not the A.A. corporation in New York City. They will argue that 
every group is independent, and the headquarters doesn't control the groups way down the pyramid.
<p>
Now that isn't entirely true, but it makes for a good legal argument in court.
<p>
And then the treatment centers avoid lawsuits by writing contracts that new patients must sign that
basically promise nothing except that the patient must pay in full, even if he quits the program after
one day.

<p>
But I sure would like to see the A.A. leaders held accountable for their actions.

<p>
See below.  As the result of a single blood test for alcohol (phosphatidylethanol) ,
this physician was asked to be evaluated at one of three 12-step oriented rehab
facilities (Talbott, Marworth, Hazelden).  He requested an independent facility but
the board of medicine denied it. He was evaluated at Hazelden in September 2011 and
they found no evidence of alcohol abuse but, because of the positive test results
that prompted the evaluation, they could not &quot;rule it out&quot; and recommended going to
AA.

<p>
Based on these recommendations the medical board mandated three 12-step meetings per
week and that he obtain a sponsor and meet with him weekly.  Once he found the
sponsor he was to provide a telephone number to them so they could call and make
sure he was working the program.  They also mandated that he obtain names and  phone
numbers from other attendees at AA and provide them to the regulatory agency so they
could call them to verify attendance.

<p>
The positive test that started the process was changed from &quot;positive&quot; to &quot;invalid&quot;
by the lab in October 2012.  The board did not consider that relevant when they
suspended him 2 months later for &quot;noncompliance.&quot;

Hello WM,
<p>
Thanks for the story. That is appalling. I did not know that the Talbott-Marsh Center was even still in
business. I thought that they got sued out of existence for false diagnosis and false imprisonment
of a doctor. And they have a terrible track record for driving doctors and nurses (their patients) to
suicide.

<p>
The Hazelden Center is of course grand central station for the 12-Step cult religion. Having them pass judgement
on anyone is like sending mental patients to Scientology for evalutation.

<p>
I wonder how many members of that Massachusetts board are actually hidden Steppers.
Can we get the names of the board members and investigate them?

Hello again, WM,
<p>
Thank you for the information. Now we have some investigating to do. What's the story with those board members?
Are they secret Steppers, trying to force people to join their religion?  Isn't it a violation of several
laws to use an official position to coerce membership in someone's chosen religion? Besides the obvious
and glaring Constitutional violation.
<p>
What I see is:

<p>
Readers can help by sleuthing and investigating. People who live in those towns in Massachusetts can especially
help by seeing who goes to A.A. meetings. And checking to see if any of those board members ever got a DWI
and were themselves sentenced to A.A. meetings.

My friend, I have said some really negative things about the 12 Steps.  I'm not
active in any recovery program right now, but if, for some reason that I cannot
imagine now but could possibly come to happen, I had to attend a 12-step meeting, I
would go in shoving you in ahead of me.  That's the only way I could avoid one
massive mugging.  You rock!

Dear Orange,

<p>
Thanks

<p>
Thank you Orange
for a very thorough and well thought out site that backs up its information
with facts.

<p>
I have found
it informative and helpful on many levels.

<p>
My personal
experience with the program was very positive in the first five years as I fell
in with a solid group of guys who were gainfully employed and led balanced
lives.  During this time, I was involved
and participated at every level, being careful to limit my exposure to the
insane business meetings and intergroup.
<p>
After that first five years it was time to move on, but I was unaware of that
or perhaps I was too afraid to move on after hearing over and over that I would
relapse if I stopped going to meetings.
<p>
Therefore, I stayed in the rooms and even connected with the program
when I moved overseas for work when my career advanced.  What I encountered in the
following years was
downright scary.  The end result was that
the negative experiences helped me to successfully extricate myself from the
rooms and a harmful, false belief system.

<p>
Being around
people who are not drinking or using was good for me in early sobriety but hurtful
in the long run.  Perhaps this type of
group is helpful in early recovery (although I don't know of any data
that actually would support this claim) but repetitive exposure to a community of
people who are self obsessed, constantly discussing problems and what they don't
want to do (drink/use) is
detrimental to healthy living and personal growth.

<p>
<h2>Stories</h2>

<p>
My negative
experiences in the program could easily fill a novel, but to keep it brief I
will mention those that were instrumental in helping me make the final decision
to leave.   Sadly, these events are just the tip of the
iceberg.  Here are just some of the experiences
during my last year in the program:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. A member
attempted to sabotage my career out of jealousy.  This actually happened more than
once if we
include lack of respect regarding anonymity.  On the last occasion it was a factor
in me
having to leave my job.  At the time it
was very difficult to find another one as I work overseas in international
finance and the global financial crisis was upon us.

<p>
<li>
2. A member
showed up at my apartment uninvited and butted into a family disagreement that
was going on at the time of his arrival.
I had to ask him to leave my home as his behavior was
inappropriate.  He then proceeded to share
all the events of that night with all the program people he knew.  Naturally, this
was done from his point of
view as a &quot;victim.&quot;   He complained that he &quot;Just wanted to come
over and talk program.&quot; The community is very small in some overseas locations
and is dominated by cliques.  Any
negative rumor can see you promptly ostracized.  As I was new to this posting, I
didn't have a
leg to stand on.  I was not welcome at
the meeting after the meeting from that day forward.

<p>
<li>
3. A sponsor
with 32 years of &quot;sobriety&quot; was stalking an ex-girlfriend of mine who was not in
the program.  He was unaware that she and
I had ended on good terms and were still friends.  She called me in a panic and
showed me his
emails to her about me which stated that I was not a good person.  She and I
considered getting the police
involved.  Without getting into details
of how I resolved the matter, I was able to make him back off and never contact
her again.

<p>
<li>
4. Numerous
breaches of confidentiality:  The big one
was when an ex-sponsor shared a personal matter that I had trusted him with in
a meeting, in front of me, while I was sitting there with my new sponsor.  I believe
he did this out of anger and
jealousy.  The behavior was so unhealthy.
At the time I was shocked that someone
with this much time would act out in such a way.  Although in hindsight, I should
not have been
surprised.  Old-timers are among the
sickest in the rooms.  Time is not a
measure of mental health or sobriety.
<p>
After this I started taking a hard look at old-timers and the rooms as a
whole.  After all, I was over 10 years
clean and sober. Was this to be my future?  When I looked at the old-timers I would ask
myself, &quot;Do I want what these people have?
Do I want to be like these old-timers who seem so disgruntled and
unhealthy?&quot;  The answer was a definite
&quot;NO!&quot;

<p>
<li>
5. Shortly thereafter,
I was back in the States visiting my mother.
I borrowed her car to go to a meeting.
There were about 100 people there.
When the meeting started, a guy shared that he hit someone's parked car with his
motorcycle on the way in to the
parking lot.  But.... He felt very good
about himself for admitting it in front of 100 people during his share and not
doing a hit and run.  And he added, if
the person with license plate XXX could see him after the meeting all would be
OK.  Never mind that it was not necessary
to ruin the meeting for the other person whose car was hit. The guy could have
simply waited until the meeting was over and exchanged details.  No, it was more
important to confess and feel
good about himself.  Yes, that was my
mom's car and the guy who hit it was quite pleased with himself after the
meeting.  I really had to hold back from
laying into him verbally.  At this point
I knew it was useless as he would simply reply with some lame slogan.  Come to find
out this character was in
Florida perpetrating the sale of reverse mortgages on the elderly.  It is a scheme
to defraud them of their homes
with the promise of a never ending annuity that terminates at their death.  These
schemes are filled with hidden fees and can
leave the elderly with a pitiful monthly allowance while taking their
homes.  Nice.
</ul>

<p>
The events
all occurred within a short period of a year.
The last incident was symbolic for what the program had become for
me.  It was a car wreck and the next time
I may not be so lucky.  The program, the
behavior it encourages and the miscreants it attracts had infiltrated my
personal and professional life in the most negative of ways.  I had to leave if I
wanted to engage in a
healthy, well-rounded life.  So that's
what I did!

<p>
<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>
Since
leaving the program, my life has improved tenfold.  I am not naive and am fully
aware that there
are undesirable people in all walks of life.
Having lived in several countries and achieved moderate success in the
world of international finance, I am mindful of their existence.   However,
nowhere and I mean nowhere, have I seen them more prevalent than the
program.

<p>
I decided on
a plan to improve my life and I followed it to the letter.  I set out to expand my
world with healthy
activities and healthy people.  It was
incredibly rewarding and turned out to be the best decision of my life.  I joined a
meditation center, took an art
class, joined a &quot;meet up&quot; group for hiking, went on the Hoffman Process retreat,
participated in personal growth seminars, read some excellent spiritual books,
etc.  I exercised consistently and stayed
socially active.  During this period I
also revisited my GP, saw a counselor for about 6 months and reconnected with a
psychiatrist to address nagging depression.
These medical professionals were extremely helpful.

<p>
It took some time but I managed to assemble a
solid group of friends who were loving and kind.  Along the way I met some other
ex-alcoholics
and addicts who got clean and sober without the program.  These people were good fun
and non-threatening.  But mostly, my friends today consist of
people who live healthy and balanced lives with no program affiliation.  They have
purpose as do I and most of them complement
my life rather than cause disruption.  Life
is good.  I love myself and I love my friends!

<p>
<h2>Where do they all go?</h2>

<p>
Most people
drop out of the program.  But the secret
that people don't talk about is that while members disappear after years, most
are not cowering in a corner going through DTs wishing they could come back to
the rooms.   I have stayed in touch with those whom I first
got sober 17 years ago.  Among my three
closest friends, none of them go to meetings and none of them are drinking or
using.  We all stopped attending at
different times in our lives, but today none of us would claim to be a member.  One
became a family man with a solid job and
is very involved in his community.
Another moved to France where he is an avid cyclist with four children
and lovely wife.  The last guy, and
perhaps the most wild to this day, became a minister.   Again, none of us go to
meetings.  None of us drink or use.  All of us have healthy, productive
lives.

<p>
<h2>Move on</h2>

<p>
Leaving the
program is liberating and people can do it and stay sober.  I hope that some of this
is useful to those
who are considering moving on with life and pursuing personal growth.  Stay busy,
embrace life and enjoy every
moment.

<p>
Love and
light to everyone,

<p>

I'm sure you'll have a field day with it. I'm personally more willing to trust your
opinions on such matters than some random infographic. Incidentally, if you're not
familiar with Tumblr, think of it as Portlandia the website.

<p>
Also, I hope you're in good health. I'm kind of worried, since you haven't updated
the letters in a few weeks.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Meatbag,
<p>
Thanks for the picture, and the concern. Not to worry. I'm just fine. I've just been busy with several
other things, including computer disk problems and getting the tablet working. And then Hostmonster.com &#8212;
the company that hosts my web site &#8212; screwed
up their email system, again, for the dozenth time, and for a week, I couldn't get into the email.
Hostmonster is terrible and getting worse.

<p>
What is even more maddening is that they feign innocence and pretend that there is no problem. &quot;Can you
describe the problem in detail? Things look fine here.&quot; I learned from another web site that the
people working the so-called &quot;help line&quot; are required to read scripts. They just give the standard
response, giving me the run-around, always asking for more details, and more description of the
problem, and insisting that there is no problem.
Yes, I need a new hosting service.
<p>
About that image: That is a good example of several logical fallacies and propaganda tricks.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
About the botulism: That is grossly unrealistic. The idea that bread will sink to the bottom and rot and
grow botulin bacteria is just untrue. Whenever somebody throws bread on the water, there is a free-for-all
dash for it. The carp attack from below, while the sea gulls, ducks and geese scramble to get it on the
surface. Bread does not last 30 seconds. No way does it sink to the bottom and stay there long enough to
rot.
<p>
The carp are actually so aggressive in going after bread that they will even
climb up on the shore to get bread. No joke. 
The first time that I saw it, I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing.
A carp crawled up onto the shore and grabbed
a piece of bread, and then turned around and crawled back into the water.
I felt like I was watching Darwin's evolution in action. &quot;Here they come, up out of the water.&quot;
<p>
<center>
<img src="http://orange-papers.info/P20111015_159095-Carp-800.png" border="0" width="800" height="600" alt="Carp feeding"><br>
This guy really wants that pastry. He just has to get around that rock that is between
him and the pastry.<br>
(He did.)
</center>
<p>
It sounds to me like what the author of that poster is describing is a dead pond &#8212; a stagnant body of water
where the muck on the bottom is anerobic, and there are no fish, so if a piece of bread sinks to the bottom,
it just sits there uneaten, and rots.  That is not a natural situation. Who killed the pond?
<p>
<li>
That leads to the next question: Why aren't the ducks getting sickened and killed by anything that they eat from the
bottom of such a dead pond?
Botulin bacteria are anerobic bacteria (meaning: can't stand oxygen) that also require an alkaline environment.
You can get botulism from a can of string beans that has gotten punctured, but never from a can of tomato sauce.
Tomatoes are far too acidic for botulism.
<p>
Well, ducks just love to dabble in the mud and dig around for worms or algae or whatever. They do it all
day long, just for entertainment. If there are botulin bacteria
growing in the bottom of the pond, it seems like the ducks would be constantly getting poisoned by whatever they
find down there. But they aren't.

<p>
<li>
About the &quot;Angel Wing&quot;: The author did not give any relevant facts, like what were the ducklings fed,
and were they kept in a cage where they couldn't get any greens?  At both downtown Portland and the Fernhill
Wetlands, the ducklings and goslings are constantly munching algae and weeds and tender greens of all kinds. And also
insects and worms and whatever they can get.
Any bread that they get is just a treat, a supplement to their regular diet. 

<p><li>
Besides, who said that the ducklings only get white bread? That is a glaring
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank">false assumption</a>.
What that poster should have been titled is, &quot;Don't feed the ducklings white bread.&quot;

<p>
I mostly feed the geese and ducks rolled oats. Then they get whole wheat bread or 14-grain bread as a treat.
A couple of loaves of bread divided between 40 or 50 ducks and geese means that nobody is getting a lot of it,
just a slice or two each.
A usual feeding for them is 10 or 15 pounds of oats and 2 loaves of bread.  No way are they living on bread.

<p>
<li> RE: &quot;Lack of nutrients impairs their immune system.&quot; Again, who says that they lack nutrients?
The author is again
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">falsely assuming</a>
that the ducklings are eating <b><i>only</i></b> white bread. That sure isn't what is
happening here. Are the sick ducklings being kept in a cage or pen which has been stripped of all vegetation?
What is keeping the ducklings from getting some greens?

<p>
If the author is trying to imply that the ducklings and goslings will not bother to eat greens if somebody
gives them white bread, well that doesn't jive with reality. Again, the goslings are very insistent about
getting their greens. They eat greens first, and then they might take some whole wheat bread or rice or
oatmeal to top things off.  When I was raising the family of five little ones, they stopped taking anything
like that from me after a couple of weeks. When their mouths got strong enough to shear off the grass,
they lived solely on grass. I took them to the park first thing in the morning for breakfast, and we
often spent all day there.  They just ate grass, morning, noon and night.  They didn't want anything else.
Ask a goose, and they will tell you, &quot;Grass. It's what's for dinner.&quot;
<p>
Here is a picture that I just posted earlier today, that shows their environment:
<p>

A Family with 4 children, coming to me to get some munchies
</center>
<p>
As you can see, there is greenery all over the place. They munch grass and other greens all day long.
Then they come to me to get some staples to supplement their diet.
What they are getting from me is essentially just grass seed. Oats, wheat, any grain, it's just big fat
grass seeds. They love grass seeds because the seeds are much more nourishing than just blades of grass.

<p>
<li>
This sentence features really twisted logic and inaccurate facts and crazy conclusions.  It's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#non_sequitur" target="_blank"> <i>non-sequitur</i></a> city:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h2>Attracts Predators and Domestic Ducks</h2>
Domestic Ducks are attracted to feeding lakes or ponds and then breed with our native ducks
which contributes to overpopulation and therefore less wild food is available.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Huh? The author was raving about the evils of white bread, and then suddenly he is saying that &quot;something&quot;
&#8212; like feeding the ducklings &#8212; attracts predators and domestic ducks.
<p>
Attracts domestic ducks?  
As if domestic ducks are just wandering around out there in the wilderness, looking for a loaf of bread?
That is so unrealistic that it is nuts. The only way that domestic ducks show up in the wilderness is if
a human dumps them out there.


<p>
<li>
And what attracts the predators, like the weasel or ermine at the Fernhill Wetlands, is tasty eggs,
ducklings and goslings. Or even an adult duck or goose, if it can get one. No way does a loaf of bread
make a weasel appear.

<p>
<li>
Then the author says that this will lead to overpopulation. Oh really? As if wild ducks don't have sex and
make babies? Only domestic ducks eating white bread have sex? Crazy. Illogical. Disconnected from reality.
<p>
And predators reduce the population. They do not cause overpopulation. And the ermine (or whatever he is)
is gradually eliminating the domestic ducks at the Fernhill Wetlands. Last year there were a dozen, and now
they are down to four, all males.
<p>
<li>
Lastly, the author claims that the offspring of the domestic ducks will eat up all of the food supply of
the wild ducks. Again, that is grossly unrealistic. The wild ducks are much better at scrounging food than are the
domestic ducks. It's the domestic ducks who run to me for some bread whenever they see me because they
are really hungry.

I won't argue with feeding ducks some nice treats like lettuce, carrots, tomato, or watermelon.
But I don't see why it has to be in the water. Now it really will sink and ferment, unless the carp eat it.
I would put it on the land.

<p>
The proof of all of that is the fact that I've been feeding the geese and ducks for 12 years now, and they
haven't gotten sick from it yet. Quite the opposite, they thrive. And when the ducklings and goslings grow up, they
bring their own babies to me to get fed.
<p>
I've had mother geese bring their babies to me the first day that they are out of the eggshell.
The mothers actually bring me their unbearably cute little fluff-balls to get fed. The mothers
trust me because I was feeding them when they were young. And their mothers in turn brought them to me because
they knew me from years of feeding. A generation of geese is three years. So I've fed the great-grandparents,
and then the grandparents, and then the parents, and then the babies. Four generations. And I've never seen
a gosling or duckling get deformed by what they got to eat.

<p>
Now if the author of that sign wants to change it to read, &quot;Please don't feed the ducklings white bread&quot;, then
we can have some agreement. Any of these things are better for them: whole wheat bread, oatmeal,
brown rice (preferably cooked, so that it is soft for the babies' mouths), any whole grain other than rye.
(The only problem with rye is that it can grow ergot fungus, which makes it &quot;black smutty rye&quot;.
Well, ergot is poisonous to geese. Most rye does not have any ergot fungus on it, and it's perfectly okay
for ducks and geese, but it's better to avoid rye on the offhand chance that a little smutty rye may have gotten
mixed into the batch.)

<p>
Thanks again for the image. There is just so much misinformation out there. It's unreal.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:<br>

<p>
I just finished reading a segment of
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test Questions 21-30</a>.
I'm convinced that a cousin's 22 year old daughter has gotten herself mixed up
in a cult. For the last almost-month she has ended a 3 year relationship
with someone we believe she still loves deeply, she has distanced herself
from her family by moving in with two woman one of which was her recruiter
into this cult, she cut her hair similar to the recruiter and she began
dressing like and imitating her. After three weeks of this behaviour, she
went to the town where the head &quot;church&quot; is located and was re&quot;saved&quot; and
baptised. The day after she came home she walked away from her job which
one month earlier she told me she loved and wanted to make her permanent
career and she also walked away from her educational endeavor. She was 3
weeks from graduation with her bachelors degree with honors on the dean's
list.  Also that day she decided to permanently move to the location of the
head &quot;church&quot; with her new &quot;family&quot; and live with them.  When they told her
that was not a good idea at this time, she went off the deep end and was
picked up by the police walking door to door in the middle of the night
claiming to be the woman who recruited her and said she was leaving for a
mission trip to Africa and wanted to give the person answering the door
something &#8212; usually an article of dirty clothing that she had packed in the
suitcase she was toting with her. The police took her to a mental facility.
That was very late Monday, April 1st early Tuesday morning. Since that time
she has had a handful of psychotic breaks that the medical staff call
highly religious is nature. The psychiatrist believes she was given a
synthetic drug of some sort and was put in a trance-like and something was
done to her. We need help. Can you please recommend where we can go for
help and tell us if you have ever heard of David Viljoen (the &quot;apostle&quot; of
this group), AWC International, and/or IAMS?

<p>
Please advise,<br>

Hello Holly,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer. I've been investigating and searching,
to see what I could find about David Viljoen and his AWC International organization. I had never heard of
him before.
Unfortunately, I don't see anything other than the usual publicity fluff web pages that say that it's a good
group. But I am very suspicious of them:

<font color="black">&quot;AWC is the ministry led by Apostle David and Prophet Deborah Viljoen.&quot;</font><br>
<b><i>Apostle and Prophet</i></b>?  Nothing like delusions of grandeur, and self-appointed messiahs.<br>
And isn't it neat how David's wife gets to be a prophet? Just like in the Moonies.

<p>
It sounds like your niece (is the daughter of a cousin a niece?) is in the right place, in the hands of doctors.
She obviously needs medical treatment, and she is getting it. I don't know what drug they might have
given her. I thought I knew all about drugs, because I used to live on a hippie commune and have taken
everything under the sun for years. (And I do mean <i>everything</i>.)
But I don't know what designer drug a brainwasher would give someone
to convert them to belief in a cult religion. That's a new one.
<p>
Her story just reeks of &quot;cult&quot;. Abandoning her college degree and career
and moving in with the church are a couple of classic signs of cult assimilation.
And so is cutting herself off from her family and severing her relationship with
her significant other.
So is &quot;cloning&quot; &#8212; cutting her hair and making herself look just like the recruiter.

<p>
First off, I would leave her in the hands of the doctors. They sound like they know what they are
doing and have a good take on the situation.
<p>
After that, you can prepare yourself to help her by
learning how to deal with a cult member in ways that actually work, rather than widen the rift between you.
 A book by Steve Hassan comes to mind: 
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank"><i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>.
That is the kind of book you want to have if you discover that
a friend or relative has gotten sucked into a cult, and you want to know how
to get them back out alive. It is described in the bibliography, which has some links to quotes.
So click on the name of the book and go there.

<p>
You can also check out Hassan's other book:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="_blank"><i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i></a>.

<p>
Here are some links to letters where we discussed the anti-cult techniques in Hassan's books.
Many of these letters talk about getting someone out of A.A., but the process is the same for any cult.
The similarity between cults is large. They all use the same mind-bending techniques, and the same
logical fallacies, and recruit the same way, and become brainwashed true believers the same way.
I have read about cults that existed hundreds of years ago,
and they sound just like the ones that plague us today.

<ol>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Don't give up</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan2" target="_blank">Use indirect criticism of the cult</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters20.html#Drew" target="_blank">
&quot;I made the mistake of being critical 
and ever since she rarely talks to me about the group and if the subject 
comes up she gets really weird...&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters24.html#Hassan3" target="_blank">
...phobia indoctrination that Steve
Hassan mentions in his book &quot;Releasing the Bonds.&quot; Do
you think this technique can really cause phobia/panic
attacks?</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters69.html#Abdul" target="_blank">
My main concern is my girlfriend of two years who waxing
and wanning out of the cult (she is addicted to the cult).</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters99.html#Steve" target="_blank">
Is there any hope of her waking up and realizing that AA has &quot;gone too
far&quot; in controlling her thinking and life?</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters144.html#Hassan" target="_blank">
why is it that although different in points of view, every cult has the same agenda
and the same M.O.?</a>.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters157.html#get_out" target="_blank">
do you have any advice for someone who desires
to protect their loved ones from the influence/adverse effects of AA?</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters234.html#JW" target="_blank">
I saw a freeminds video on the Watchtower &amp;
mind control. I am leaving the JW and wanted to know where I could find
literature on this subject?

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters345.html#Julia" target="_blank">
I have no idea on how to approach her, I tried to talk about this a few
times, the conversations did not go well. She's like a different person and
I want her back.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters46.html#Toni" target="_blank">
We need help and advice on breaking up part of our family that has a
cult mentality.</a>

Good luck, and have a good day now. And please don't hesitate to write back if you have more questions.
