<h2>MALE LOGIC</h2>

<p>
Woman: Do you drink beer?
<p>
Man: Yes

<p>
Woman: How many beers a day?
<p>
Man: Usually about 3.

<p>
Woman: How much do you pay per beer?
<p>
Man: $5.00 which includes a tip. (This is where it gets scary !)

<p>
Woman: And how long have you been drinking?
<p>
Man: About 20 years, I suppose.

<p>
Woman: So a beer costs $5 and you have 3 beers a day which puts your spending each
month at $450. In one year, it would be approximately $5400 ...correct?
<p>
Man: Correct.

<p>
Woman: If in 1 year you spend $5400, not accounting for inflation, the past 20 years
puts your spending at $108,000, correct?
<p>
Man: Correct.

<p>
Woman: Do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer, that money could have been
put in a step-up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest
for the past 20 years, you could have now bought a Ferrari?

<p>
Man: Do you drink beer?

<p>
Woman: No.

<p>
Man: Where's your Ferrari?

From:  	&quot;J.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Recovery without steps<br>

<p>
Greetings Agent Orange,

<p>
I have been growing increasingly frustrated with AA (my group of choice)
and what I have found out for myself there. I've been looking online for a
different take on the recovery process and came across your site. Excellent
work and an amazing amount of good solid information here. Well done!

<p>
I am 40 years old and 16 months sober. I went to my first and only rehab in
February of last year and got out from under a nasty addiction to
prescription meds &#8212; benzos and opiates.

<p>
I admit that I am someone with an addictive personality. I drank and smoked
pot regularly and occasionally used other substances for years. I managed
to do well in many aspects of my life but eventually my tendencies toward
excess (coupled with very liberal and generous doctors and friends) got the
best of me and in the end I became quite a mess.

<p>
However, it was the actual treatment that came closer to killing me than
the substance abuse. I was there under medically supervised detox for three
days. On the fourth day the dispensary mixed up my meds and I had a seizure
and collapsed. I was rushed to a hospital and admitted to the ICU as a
stroke patient because I had lost my ability to speak and most of my fine
motor control.

<p>
So there I sat, hooked up to IVs and tubes. I suffered multiple seizures
and the full unmedicated effects of withdrawal for three days. It was the
kindness and attention of a 70 year old neurologist who actually bothered
to request my chart from the rehab (they didn't send it voluntarily) and
ordered me a dose of Ativan and Steriods. I came out of my debilitated
state almost immediately and stabilized. So I was discharged... you guessed
it... right back to the rehab I arrived from.

<p>
When I got back, they considered me to be done detox and immediately began
the intensive rehab portion. It was probably pretty standard rehab stuff
for 12 to 14 hours a day &#8212; group therapy, cafeteria food, 12 step oriented
&quot;classes&quot;, daily AA and NA meetings, limited visits and outdoor time &#8212; and
I was willing to endure it because I really wanted to get better. I was in
very poor physical condition but I pushed through it and became stronger
mentally and physically. I have absolutely no regrets as to the space I got
to begin recovery and the pace I was expected to run at. The food wasn't
all that bad either.

<p>
After five weeks I completed the program, but the further along I went I
had an increasingly hard time with even the most basic aspects of &quot;the
program&quot;. I was shocked that questions about it were rebuked with phrases
like &quot;take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth&quot; or &quot;keep
it simple stupid&quot; or &quot;it was your best thinking that got you here.&quot; In
rehab, one particularly nasty councilor even pointed me out publicly as
someone who &quot;was just along for the ride and not giving myself to the
program.&quot; I would hardly say I was not giving myself to the program after
being willing to go back for treatment after their little medication
mistake.

<p>
So I concluded at the end of my stay that rehabs are a business. They are a
very large and profitable business. I did find examples of people there who
are genuinely caring and whose hearts and minds are in the right place but
they are the exception and not the rule.

<p>
Mostly everything &quot;educational&quot; is provided directly by 12 step programs
and Hazelden. Why? Because it's popularly accepted and it's FREE.

<p>
It's an example of our broken and ineffective education system twisted to
suit people with serious addiction problems. Additionally, the basis of all
of the teaching materials is 70+ years old and never adapted or grew with
our increased understanding of our minds and methods of helping people. In
fact, after reading much of the hard research and statistical data on your
site, I'm afraid that it is evident the materials have not been adjusted
even in light of their of their own mistakes and abysmal failures.

<p>
But why would they change? Working on improving their materials requires a
lot of time and money and would cut deep into the profitability of the
whole system I am sure. Since there is no real oversight or regulation or
required evaluation of the actual content provided to people in rehabs,
finding a reason to do this is eclipsed by the all mighty dollar.

<p>
Speaking of bad materials, my problem begins right with step 1 &#8212; 
powerlessness. I am not powerless. I have been known to make bad decisions
with what and how much I put in my body. I want to learn to make better
decisions and cope better overall with the ups and down of life and not
turn to substances. That's why I was there &#8212; not to surrender control of my
God given free will.

<p>
Ironically, I did find spirituality through this process. However, it has
very little to do with my attendance to a 12 step program or my adherence
to it's principals. At one point it was actually suggested I use a doorknob
as my higher power. Ridiculous!

<p>
So why, you may ask, am I writing you all of this while I'm still in the
program? I have a &quot;home group&quot; and I show up to make coffee every week. I
setup the tables and chairs. I buy supplies. I hand out anniversary coins.
I participate in events. I've read the Big Book several times. I have a
sponsor but we really dont' talk much. I will gladly go out of my way to
talk to another person in recovery if they need an ear to bend.

<p>
I do it because I want to be a friendly face, a compassionate listener and
a voice of reason. I want to show people that you can be sober and not
necessarily march to the extremist beat of the AA drummer. I do it because
the entire convoluted system is geared to send people just like me right
into these groups without a concern for what really happens there and a
complete lack of any real oversight. Sure, there are alternatives, but they
are few and far between.

<p>
However, it is hard. I hear the same stuff repeated meeting after meeting
ad nauseam. I hear smart and capable people chanting about how &quot;happy,
joyous and free&quot; they are and constantly reliving their painful past in a
ritualized and very public self-inflicted emotional flogging. They
mindlessly repeat mantras and cliche as an answer to everything. They face
the challenges of life by &quot;giving it up to God&quot; and writing off the hard
work that would beget them a more favorable outcome. I dont' care who or
what you &quot;give it up&quot; to, but giving up is giving up no matter what &quot;it&quot;
is.

<p>
It's also become a point to repeatedly &quot;suggest&quot; I make more meetings and
work a &quot;better program&quot;. The fact that I do what I do for my group seems to
never be enough. I suspect it won't ever be enough &#8212; that is, until I drink
the kool-aid. And when I voice my concerns, I'm told I'm just getting a
resentment.

<p>
Well, guess what? I resent that.

<p>
Until I can find a better way to do my part to help people going through
what I did, I will continue to go. In the meantime, I hope you'll publish
my letter as a testimony to your visitors that it is possible to take the
good, leave the bad and progress into a better way of life by coloring
outside of the traditional lines of 12 step groups. It is possible. I live
it every day.

<p>
Many people in AA would call this heresy, and I would be quick to remind
them that the truth is always heresy to the closed minded. Likewise, pride
always comes before the fall.

<p>
Your work in this regard is amazing and inspiring to me. Keep it up.

<p>
Regards,

<p>
J

Hello J,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It says so much. You are obviously a member in good standing of
<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">the Newcomers Rescue League</a>.
Congratulations, and thanks for caring about the vulnerable newcomers.

<p>
You might also enjoy some SMART meetings, or SOS, where you can get some sane company and
advice and ideas. I'm not saying that you should quit A.A.  &#8212;  I think you probably really
are helping newcomers there  &#8212;  but it might be nice to occasionally talk to sane people
who won't tell you to &quot;Take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth.&quot;

<p>
Personally, I see AA and most other religions as a vile cancer to be eradicated from
the planet, simply one of a host of inherent evils our species must overcome.

<p>
AA is a twist on traditional religion, but it is still religion. Nonetheless, don't
offhandedly dismiss their philosophy, rhetoric and dogma no matter how absurd and
illogical it may seem now that you've made it though to the other side. Know your
enemy. So long as you realize that the underpinnings of any religion are founded in
a conman's definition of the word &quot;faith,&quot; you'll see right through their house of
cards. Follow the money and the power structure, and you'll win their shell game
every time.

<p>
The basis of control in any cult lies in suspension of critical thought. (ie. &quot;Your
best thinking got you here.&quot;) The next time you &quot;argue&quot; with an AA, realize that
you're dealing with a weakened mind. They put down the vodka, then drank the kool-aid
willingly, and adored it. They came back for seconds. They liked it so much that
they can't understand why everyone doesn't else doesn't like it. &quot;There are such
unfortunates.&quot;

<p>
One of my favorite activities is planting seeds of doubt in the minds of lower level
AA minions (you know, the &quot;baldies&quot; who shave their heads like Hare Krishnas, do
manual labor for the elders and perform crowd control in the meeting halls), who may
or may not still be on a &quot;pink cloud.&quot; Nothing brings me ecstatic glee so much as
attending a meeting and, after letting a journeyman chair talk himself up with the
usual bullshit,  then asking them &#8212; rhetorically, of course &#8212; an obvious question
that later they have to consult their sponsor about.

<p>
Here's one of my favorites. They'll wax on about picking up chips for X amount of
days, months and years, then you ask them (with a sincere and perplexed look on your
face) why it is we get chips.

<p>
Then explain it something like this: My neighbor across the street, he gets up every
morning at 5AM and he goes to work where he does his 8 to 10 hours then comes home
and cuts his grass, eats his supper, plays with his kid, fucks his wife, goes to
sleep, then wakes up the next morning and does it all over again. He does this five
or six days a week, and on weekends he watches a ball game or does chores around the
house. After several years of this he manages to save up enough money for a boat or
something, and he's content  with what he has. He pays his mortage, pay his taxes
and produces something every day of his life, he doesn't break the law and generally
treats others like he'd want to be treated.

<p>
Where is his chip? Don't you think he deserves one? Don't you think he has moments
of doubt in his life and endures the same ups and downs and tragedies as we all do?
He doesn't stay drunk all the time, probably because he's got other shit he'd rather
do. He makes a conscious decision to live his life, sometimes on his own terms,
sometimes on somebody else's. Yet we all applaud for someone picking up a chip like
we would a five year-old who manages to shit in a designated container and somewhat
wipe his own ass. Why do we expect to be congratulated and applauded for doing what
you're SUPPOSED to be doing anyway?

<p>
Most times I've used some variation of that argument in a meeting it has resulted in
a chain reaction of crosstalk and hostility, sometimes even a heavy hand clapped on
my shoulder urging me to shut my mouth or leave. But the seed has been planted, and
the organism reacts, and just like any cancer cell it will defend itself against a
foreign object, or a like how a cockroach will instinctively scurry away from the
light.

<p>
Their eyes bore into me and their hatred is palpable. &quot;How dare you, you
motherfucker.&quot; It has a ripple effect, as the elders clamor to regain control.
They'll talk about that shit for the next week, and bring their arguments back to
the meeting hall, none of which ever seem to make any real sense.

<p>
And then, I move on to the next target. We all recover in different ways, and it is
a selfish program.

<p>

<p>
Have you experienced drug/alcohol addiction?  Your writing style reminds me
of that portion of English class; &quot;Ok boys and girls, we are now going to
learn about persuasion and argumenative writing.&quot;  Don't you see that it is
problematic to take such a complex issue and act like you have all of the
answers?  You failed to present any of the positive outcomes.  You are so
one sided and black and white that it's difficult to respect your opinion.
The people who failed, succeeded, or remained unaffected by the program
each have a different life story.  They are complex humans, not a case
number or statistic.  Therefore you should not be so quick to judge.  What
is your motive here?  Your coldness makes me cringe.  Even aa people
question what we are doing in the program, but we are honded with our aa
people who are now friends and neighbors.  Please, if you care about
helping addicts, and contributing to society, then use your writing gifts
to educate; not simply delight your ego in a one sided rage.

<p>
Emily, you also failed to provide any of the &quot;positive outcomes&quot;. You also failed to
say how many there are. And you failed to compare the number of A.A. success stories to
the number of A.A. failures.

<p>
Now I did, and so did Dr. George E. Vaillant, who went on to become the most famous contemporary
A.A. Trustee.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant tracked his first 100 A.A.-treated patients for 8 years</a>,
and the score was: 5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.

<p>
So there are your &quot;positive outcomes&quot;. Five sober people out of a hundred.  But A.A. cannot even
take the credit for them, and Dr. Vaillant said so. Why? Because that is the normal rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholics. An untreated group of alcoholics  &#8212;  that is, people who
got no &quot;help&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;support group&quot; recovered at the same rate,
so the number of recoveries that could be attributed to the A.A. program was zero.
The people who quit drinking were the people who were going to quit anyway, no matter where they were.
A.A. did not improve on the situation at all.
Even worse, the A.A.-treated patients had the highest death rate of any mode of treatment that
Dr. Vaillant studied.
And that came from a doctor who just loves A.A., and who went on to become a devoted Trustee of A.A.
and its biggest booster.
(Dr. Vaillant is just in love with the A.A. religion, and he doesn't seem to care that it kills alcoholics.)


<p>
Now, would you like to discuss the A.A. success rate, or failure rate?

<p>
Alright,  I have been reading more and have found a healthy respect for
your work.  I appreciate all of the responses you give to people in the
letters portion of your blog, especially the links to other authors, sites,
and resources.  I think I got mad because the truths in your message are
frightening.  I want the mtgs to work for me.  With truth, even
disappointing truths, comes a more balanced point of view.  I am lucky that
the women of aa I have befriended are level headed, well intended people.
I will be looking out for the red flags of the program, thank you.
<p>
Luckily, my powerlessness was mainly with dumb old mary-jane.  I got sober
from pot in 2006 but relapsed in 2012, a year ago. The relapse was only a
week, but it made me absolutely nutty, then dangerously depressed,
suicidal.  I went to the program 1 year ago to learn to forgive myself bc i
was so upset that i broke my 5.5 years sobriety. A year later, with that 1
mtg a week, I am sober and alcohol free, which is a bonus. I have a
personal concept of spirituality. I have all of these tools I was missing
out on before. I will keep with it, but in a more careful way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Emily,
<p>
Thank you for the response. I'm glad to hear that you are getting a grip and living
your life the way that you really want to.
<p>
I can understand how having your beliefs shattered could anger and frighten you. It feels like
somebody is pulling the rug out from under you, and threatening you.
  I am reminded of a semi-obscene remark from
Oscar Wilde: &quot;My dear, you have just learned something, although, right now, it feels like 
you just lost something.&quot;

<p>
I doubt that the 12-Step group is really giving you the tools that you need
to stay clean and sober. Confessing all of your sins and declaring that you are powerless
is not something that will help you.
The 12-Step program is brainwashing, not therapy, you know. (Look at
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Jay Lifton's description of Chinese Communist brainwashing</a>,
and notice how similar it is to the 12 Steps.)

<p>
And you are not powerless. You only slipped for a week, and then you got a grip and decided that
you did not wish to go down that road any more, so you quit smoking pot, again.
That is not powerlessness. That is strength and control and power. Congratulations.
<p>
By the way, that was a &quot;slip&quot;, not a relapse.  A relapse is where you really loose it and go all of
the way back down, like smoking and drinking for another year, or several years. Just backsliding for
a week and then getting it back together is merely a slip. And that's another sign that you were
never powerless.
<p>
You said that you were frightened because you wanted the meetings to work.
May I suggest some other meetings that might work better?

I was doing medical research and stumbled on your site.  I had to laugh
when I saw Clancy I.'s name pop up.  From the moment  I first met him I
knew he was a humbug and a fake.  You should advise people in AA that
they should never get a sponsor with more than 3 or four sponsees.
Beyond that it's an entourage and not a recovery tool.  When I first met
him Clancy had over 150 sponsees and was bragging about it.  I am 27
years sober and have always gone to Atheist and Agnostic AA meetings in
San Francisco.  We are radical enough here to get away with it.  I think
you would enjoy them.  Have a glad day.  Please do not use my name if
you publish this email.  My handle is The Wanderer (from the I Ching

Hello Wanderer,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the note about Clancy. And I'm glad to hear
that you are doing well. And congratulations for taking care of your health for 27 years.

<p>
Actually, I question whether sponsors do any good for the sponsees, even if they only
divide their time between three or four sponsees. The one and only
valid controlled test of sponsors that I know of found that the sponsors did nothing for the sponsees.

BLOG NOTE:  06/05/2013

<p>
Recently, a thought occurred to me that has been staring me in the face for 
years: It is entirely possible that the Chinese Communists learned 
brainwashing from Dr. Frank Buchman and his wierd cult religion.<br></p>
<p> We have occasionally looked at Dr. Robert J. Lifton's <i>Eight Conditions for Thought Reform</i>,
 i.e. &quot;brainwashing&quot;, summarized here, and remarked that the 12 Steps 
are very similar to the techniques of Chinese Communist brainwashing:<br>
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8</a><br></p>
<p>We
 all know that Bill Wilson copied all of the material for the 12 Steps 
from Dr. Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot; cult religion.  Bill Wilson even
 said so:<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<table width="75%" border="5" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="40" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Early
 AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgement of character 
defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight 
from the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their former 
leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;</font><br>
== William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.<br>

<p>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining ten Steps? Where 
did we learn about moral inventory, amends for harm done, turning our 
wills and lives over to God? Where did we learn about meditation and 
prayer and all the rest of it? The spiritual substance of our remaining 
ten Steps came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier association 
with the Oxford Groups, as they were then led in America by that 
Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.</font><br>
== William G. Wilson, <i>The Language of the Heart</i>, page 298, published posthumously in 1988.<br></p>

<p>(Bill
 Wilson was of course being deceptive there. Bill listed Rev. Sam 
Shoemaker as the leader of the Oxford Groups. Actually, Sam Shoemaker 
was the number two man. Frank Buchman was the leader, and he is the man 
who created and promoted all of that perverted religious dogma. But 
Frank Buchman had a terrible reputation for his praise of Adolf Hitler 
and Heinrich Himmler and the Nazis, so Bill thought it best to avoid 
mentioning the Buchman name.)

<a name="conviction" id="conviction"> </a>
<a name="five_C" id="five_C"> </a>
<b>&quot;The Five C's&quot;</b>
were a core part of Buchmanism: These steps were the procedure for 
recruiting more members. The most important duty of members was to  &quot;win
more souls&quot; for the Group. The five C's were:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Confession</li>
<li>Conviction</li>
<li>Conversion</li>
<li>Conservation</li>
</ol>
<p>
What they meant was:
<p>
<ol><li> First, the recruiter got the prospect's Confidence and trust by utilizing
whatever mind games were required. <font color="#9F0000"> &nbsp; (Yes, it's a &quot;con&quot;  &#8212;  a <i>confidence</i> game.)</font>
<p><li>
Then, the recruiter Confessed something to the prospect in order to get
his trust, and encouraged him to Confess something about himself in 
return. Gradually, the recruiter pressured the prospect to Confess all 
of his innermost dirty little secrets. The Oxford Group manual called
&quot;<a href="soulsurgery.pdf">Soul Surgery</a>&quot;
tells us that recruiters must be &quot;lovingly relentless&quot; in
insisting that a confession be made.<p>
</p></li><li>
Then came Conviction &#8212; the recruiter betrayed the prospect's trust, and
turned his confession around and used it against him, amplifying and 
exaggerating it, in order to make the prospect feel as guilty as 
possible. The recruiter got the prospect to 'Convict' himself of sins &#8212; 
that is, to find himself guilty of having committed many sins and to 
confess that he was a worthless sinner who had been defeated by sin.<br><p></p></li><li>
Then, the recruiter held out religious Conversion as the only way to 
escape from the feelings of guilt. The prospect was told that he must 
&quot;surrender himself to God&quot; (really, surrender to the Oxford Group 
recruiters).<p></p></li>
<li> And the last 'C' was &quot;Conservation&quot;, which 
was somehow redefined to mean that the new convert had to go out and 
recruit more new cult members, using the same Five C's as were just used
on him, doing unto others what had just been done unto him. </li></ol>

<p> Note the similarity between Buchman's routine for conversion of prospects, and the
 <a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds" target="_blank">Red Chinese brainwashing</a>
that was inflicted on the American, British, and other United Nations soldiers in
North Korea during the Korean War:</p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Reds had found that the easiest way to subdue any group of people was 
to give its members a guilt complex and then to lead them on from 
self-denunciation to  self-betrayal. All that was required to put this 
across was a sufficiently heartless exploitation of the essential 
goodness in people, so that they would seek self-sacrifice to compensate
 for their feelings of guilt. The self-sacrifice obviously made 
available to them in this inside-out environment is some form of 
treason.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Brainwashing, From Pavlov to Powers</i>, Edward Hunter, page 169.</font>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p> In Buchman's cult, the self-sacrifice that was made available
to the guilt-ridden new convert was the chance to surrender to the 
cult, and become a slave of the cult, and spend the rest of his life <i>&quot;Under God-Control&quot;</i>,
&quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot; (as Buchman and his lieutenants 
defined it), and, of course, recruiting more members for the cult. </p><p>Another
vital ingredient for a good brainwashing program is a method for 
inducing a sense of helplessness or powerlessness in the victims. Prof. 
Margaret Thaler Singer listed that as one of her
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">five  essential conditions</a> for an effective mind-control program &#8212; <font color="#cf0000">
<i>&quot;Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.&quot;</i></font></p><p>
The Red Chinese guards could easily induce such feelings of 
helplessness and fear &#8212; their victims were already prisoners of war, and
the guards could randomly, arbitrarily, punish or kill whomever they 
chose, and they did. Buchman induced a sense of helplessness and fear by
declaring that everyone was defeated by sin and incapable of running 
his or her own life (and presumably doomed to Hell unless saved by 
Buchman), because even their thinking was corrupted by sin &#8212; <font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Oh Lord, manage me, for I cannot manage myself.&quot;</i></font>
</p>

<p>
(And Alcoholics Anonymous induces feelings of fear, helplessness, guilt, and dependency
by telling newcomers that they will die of alcoholism unless they stay in A.A. for life and
&quot;work a strong program&quot;, and &quot;surrender&quot;.)

<p>
That similarity may not be coincidental at all. Dr. Frank 
Buchman went to China as a Lutheran missionary in 1915, 1916, and 1918, 
and taught the Chinese his strange guilt-inducing methods of religious 
conversion. Is it just a big coincidence that 30 years later, the 
Chinese Communists had coercive conversion techniques that are almost 
identical to Frank Buchman's techniques?</p>

<p>I also notice how 
conversion is conversion the world over. That is, it doesn't seem to 
matter whether the goal is to aggressively convert someone to belief in a
cult religion, allegedly worshipping a God, or Communism, worshipping 
dialectical materialism and &quot;the force of history&quot;. The mechanics of the
conversion process are the same. </p>

Chinese Communist brainwashing routines. He marvelled that the brainwashing sessions
were just like Moral Re-Armament meetings.

Subject:  	AA Lies<br>

<p>
Hi:
<p>
I've been a heavy drinker for 25+ yrs, gotten 3 DUI's, and lost everything including
my career in Supply Chain (I have a master's degree, but have been unemployed for
quite some time now).  I've read through your post
&quot;<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About AA?</a>&quot;
and started reading through
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>&quot;.
I've been judicially forced to
attend AA and 12-Step programs several times in the past, but I could never truly
grasp the 'programs' and always had lingering doubts about the dogmas, but could
never articulate the specifics.
<p>
I couldn't help but notice all of the time, effort, and most importantly research,
that you've put into your posts!!  Very commendable, to say the least.  Furthermore,
I wholeheartedly agree with you.
<p>
Who are you exactly, and how can I help?  I am interested in working with the
courts/jails in sharing a recovery program that I personally have found effective
recently.  It's very in-depth, scientific, practical, and not based on religion
whatsoever.  Perhaps my past issues in &quot;getting with the program&quot; have failed
dismally time and time again simply because I couldn't relate and/or connect with
the &quot;information&quot; being conveyed or insidious &quot;tactics&quot; being used.  However, I was
very receptive to this program for some reason, although it is time consuming and
requires effort.  However, it seems to be quite effective.

Hello Danyl,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well now, and have found something that works for you.
And thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
Now you have me curious. You didn't say what new recovery program you are using now. I am always interested
in hearing about any new method of recovery that is &quot;very in-depth, scientific,
practical, and not based on religion whatsoever.&quot;

<p>
How can you help? The first thing that comes to mind is publicity and politics.
That is, we need more publicity and broadcasting of the truth to counter the river of lies and
misinformation that comes out of the A.A. propaganda machine.
<p>
And we need to inform our politicians  &#8212;  all of them  &#8212;  about the truth about A.A., and how sending
people to treatment programs that are based on the 12 Steps is a waste of money.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters96.html#Wellstone" target="_blank">The Paul Wellstone Act for
&quot;Equal Treatment&quot; of Mental Illness</a>
authorized payment of treatment centers
for treating &quot;alcoholism&quot;. In other words, health insurance had to pay for treatment
of drug and alcohol problems, as well as paying for treatment of mental illness.
 However, there was a clause in there that
said that the treatment programs that get money must be proven to actually work.
<p>
A.A. and the 12-Step routine will never pass that test. Unfortunately, I don't
think that requirement is being enforced. We should make sure that it is enforced.
Tell your politicians that no HMO or health insurance company should have to pay
for any quack treatment that is based on the 12-Step religion.
And the treatment programs based on the 12 Steps or A.A. or N.A. just don't work.
<p>
And nobody should ever be sentenced to A.A. meetings. That is unConstitutional, coerced religion.
(Heretical cult religion at that.)

<p>
And we must keep on telling our politicians that; 
all of our politicians, at all levels, from the President down to your local state representatives and
the city council. The local representatives have a lot of control over funding for things like
drug and alcohol programs. Often, the city and state fund the local detox center.
<p> 
Happily, here in Oregon, the state's Oregon Health Plan no longer pays for drug and alcohol treatment, 
all of which was based on A.A. and N.A. and the 12 Steps. Even worse,
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Harry_K" target="_blank">my so-called &quot;counselor&quot;
was a cocaine-snorting Internet child pornographer and child rapist</a>, but he isn't getting
paid to counsel any more.
<p>
Unfortunately, the state health plan did not defund that fraud
before the quacks drained most of the funds out of the health plan, which is now almost defunct,
and really sick people cannot get their medications.
But I keep on telling that story, in hopes that our politicians will not get fooled by the Stepper
propaganda and start funding that quackery again.

<p>
I enjoyed the read; however, I am unclear on how the group uses funds of any of your
mentioned resources, insurance companies, etc., for their own purpose. How does that
work?
<p>
Thanks.

Hello Marsha,
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous has a very unusual structure, different from
any other cult. Most members of A.A. get their funding through
&quot;other channels&quot;, like the health insurance companies.  Most of the so-called &quot;counselors&quot;
who work at detox centers and treatment centers are actually A.A. and N.A. members, who teach
their cult religion to the sick patients, and constantly tell the patients that they
must go to A.A. or N.A. for the rest of their lives or they will die.
Thus the health insurance companies are actually paying
the A.A. and N.A. recruiters, so the headquarters in New York doesn't have to.
Similarly, most A.A. promoters and propagandists work for the 12-Step rehab racket.

<p>
Thus, strangely enough, A.A. actually has a paid staff that is much, much larger than the crew on their actual
payroll. Isn't that a cute arrangement?
<p>
Just recently, we were discussing in the forum 
 how a conspiracy of failed doctors  &#8212;  doctors who lost their own
licenses to practice medicine because of drug or alcohol abuse  &#8212; is working  under the
auspices of ASAM  &#8212;  the &quot;American Society of Addiction Medicine&quot;, which is an A.A. front group
 &#8212; and they have managed to weasel themselves
into positions of power in most states of the USA,
 where they can pass judgement on all other doctors and nurses and dentists and
verterinarians and other medical practitioners, and decide whether they are guilty of drug abuse or
alcohol abuse  &#8212;  without any real evidence. Hearsay, slander, rumor, and inuendo are enough.
Then the conspirators send their victims to a chosen 12-Step facility like Hazelden for &quot;evaluation&quot;,
where they are invariably found to need 12-Step treatment.
Then the conspirators can sentence their victim to &quot;treatment&quot; in a 12-Step facility, at the
victim's expense, of course, or else the victim looses his or her license to practice medicine.
And thus the Evil Empire makes even more money.<br>

Subject:  	About the NAADAC<br>

<p>
I was looking for some information, and noticed that you list the
Association for Addiction Professionals, along with a few other great sites
on: 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222237/http://www.green-papers.org/rebuttal.htm" target="_blank">
http://www.green-papers.org/rebuttal.htm</a>

<p>
Honestly, thank you for mentioning them. I really can't say enough positive
things about the NAADAC.

<p>
It may be worthwhile to mention 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222237/http://www.withdrawal.org/" target="_blank">http://www.withdrawal.org</a> 
either above or below them. The signs and symptoms of withdrawal are very serious.
Unfortunately, the community does not discuss these dangers often enough,
and most webpages offering information are commercial with an interest in
client acquisition.

<p>
Withdrawal.org is part of the USA Addiction Treatment Partnership, a
Florida registered non-profit. This way you can point visitors somewhere
without having to trust a commercial site.

<p>
Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you again, and keep up the
great work.

<p>
Take care.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Mari H.<br>
Outreach Director<br>

Hello Mari,
<p>
Thanks for the note. But honestly, I don't understand how you can simultaneously praise my work
and praise NAADAC.  We are diametrically opposed in our approach to treating addictions.
I consider NAADAC to be an evil organization.

<p>
The vast majority of so-called &quot;addiction professionals&quot; and &quot;drug
and alcohol counselors&quot; in the USA are selling an old cult religion from the
nineteen-thirties as a quack cure for substance abuse problems.
<p>
They are generally corrupt, too.  They know how phony their act is.
They know that it doesn't work. But it's a paying job, and what other job can a burned out old addict get?
<p>
My own &quot;counselor&quot; at the &quot;treatment center&quot; was a cocaine-snorting
Internet child pornographer and child raper. And the police arrested him for it and he was convicted and
sent to prison for it. You can read the whole story 
<a href="orange-letters298.html#Harry_K" target="_blank">here</a>.
That's really some counselor, isn't it? Just the guy to be giving you life advice.
<p>
Yes, withdrawal symptoms can be very bad. I know. I went into DT's one time when I quit drinking.
You can read that story here:

**     Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision
**     to step out in front of a moving car. You would call that not a
**     disease but an error in judgment. When a bunch of people begin to
**     do it, it is a social error, a life-style. In this particular
**     life-style the motto is &quot;Be happy now because tomorrow you are
**     dying,&quot; but the dying begins almost at once, and the happiness is
**     a memory. It is, then, only a speeding up, an intensifying, of the
**     ordinary human existence. It is not different from your life-style,
**     it is only faster. It all takes place in days or weeks or months
**     instead of years. &quot;Take the cash and let the credit go,&quot; as Villon
**     said in 1460. But that is a mistake if the cash is a penny and the
**     credit a whole lifetime.
