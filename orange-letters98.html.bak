Subject:  	The Dangerous Cult of A.A.<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
My mind is swimming with thoughts, so please bear with me!!! First let me
tell you that I think your website is fantastic! I actually found it by googling
&quot;A.A. cult&quot;, listed along with some other less in depth references. The amount of
strange behavior I have witnessed over the last two years surrounding A.A. would
take a while for me to fully detail, but please allow me to relate one story in
particular, just in case it will help someone else realize the contradictions and
absurdities of this &quot;religion&quot;.
<p>
If a &quot;newcomer&quot; is reading this and has been feeling that A.A. is not for
them... go with your gut instinct and politely sever all ties to anyone or anything
(chips,lit.) related to Alcoholics Anonymous... because I wish I had done that in
the beginning.
<p>
The biggest mistake I made, second only to actually joining this cult, was to obtain
a job working for an established member that I could only describe as a
&quot;Lieutenant Guru&quot; (just not quite an old timer, yet). IF YOU ARE A NEWCOMER &#8212; 
NEVER, EVER, EVER DO THIS!!! I not only allowed my personal life to be controlled, but
also my financial one as well. In a previous letter the writer described being
punished and rewarded, well &#8212; imagine what happens when it comes down to your
participation in the cult and your paycheck!!! To make matters worse, it took me
quite some time (due to the cult-brainwashing-self-questioning-psycho-analysis) to
realize what a manipulating and controlling egomaniac of a fraud he ACTUALLY was
(as were 99% of the established members I came in contact with). So I bit my tongue
for a year and a half with this guy, because I was in an unfamiliar and uncertain
job market, and bore first-hand witness to his EXTREMELY disturbing behavior. I
never sponsored anyone during my tenure mostly due to the way he spoke so openly
about his sponsees' personal matters and how condescending he was to them and
 &#8212; behind their backs &#8212; in regards to them (another trait shared by the previously
mentioned 99%)... I never wanted to be like that, and never will be, thank goodness!
<p>
<a name="bad_sponsor"> </a>
I'll be honest Orange, one of my favorite things on your site is to read what I
refer to as &quot;anti-share&quot; letters from former A.A. cult members describing
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">their horror stories</a>.
It truly makes me feel more at ease knowing that I'm not
alone. Here's my personal favorite:

<p>
 &#8212; My former boss (of whom I previously spoke), a sponsor with numerous sponsees, was
caught cheating on his longtime girlfriend with her twenty-something sponsee. HIS
EXPLANATION &#8212; &quot;God probably wanted me to do this so I wouldn't drink.&quot; and &quot;I
didn't do a thorough enough 4th Step last time.&quot;

<p>
...YOU MEAN IT WASN'T THE FACT THAT YOU COULDN'T KEEP YOUR PANTS ZIPPED UP?!!!... Oh
yeah, I forgot &#8212; it's all God's fault in A.A., you don't have to take responsibility
for your actions whatsoever!!!

<p>
So, he went absolutely nuts, leaving me alone on the job with his clients so he
could go blubbering around town like a fool, making amends for stealing a
screwdriver here and a dustpan there five freakin' years ago. His reasoning was
that he knew that
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises">the promises</a>
came true once before and they would again if he
humbled himself before his god and made amends (admitted his sins) again. Even the
Big Book says that's not the point of making an amends! But you know what?... SHE
TOOK HIM BACK!!! After he acted like a total jackass and nearly starved himself to
death by not eating for a week, she fell for his manipulating guilt trip (I'm sure
the Cult-Think had her believing it was somehow partially her fault). I still
can't believe it, months later.

<p>
He was sponsoring new guys during this episode and continues to, he never lost one
or let one go the whole time... another golden cult member untouchable by the
morals of man or God. The thing that really burned me is that he gave me unwanted
advice for months and months in regards to how to treat a woman properly (as
though I had no clue) while this was going on! He also admitted to me after he got
caught that this girl wasn't the only one he'd slept with in the rooms! I guess he
really was &quot;Practicing those principles in all his AFFAIRS&quot;!!!

<p>
I quit working for him and severed my ties to A.A. completely after that
incident (I was pretty well on my way out by then anyways).
That takes the cake as far as wacky A.A. stuff (and trust me, I saw A LOT of
wackiness around A.A.)

<p>
Thanks for letting me vent and thanks for all your hard work, Orange!

<p>
(please keep me completely anonymous, no name or address... not like what A.A. calls
it, I really mean anonymous!)

<p>
PEACE  &#8212;  &quot;anonymous&quot;

<font color="blue">
Hello, anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thank you for sharing (or &quot;anti-sharing&quot;,
as you call it &#8212; cute phrase).
It's good for other people to hear about the goings-on in there.
<p>
You know, it just occurred to me that the people who really have
&quot;spiritual recoveries&quot; or &quot;spiritual awakenings&quot; are the
people who refuse to go along with the immoral and unspiritual behavior.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
Yeah, you know, now that I have read almost the  entirety of your web
site (except for all the letters), I regret having sent you  that previous
email &#8212; your research into the foundations of the Oxford Group and  its later
incarnations and offshoots is impressively thorough, and your position  is very
well-articulated and rational (albeit biased against cults).  With  a sample size
of one (myself), I cannot address the issue of confusing causation  with
correlation &#8212; no one person could, although that 5% recovery rate is,  as you state,
pretty damning circumstantial evidence against causation.   Certainly, I never
had the subjective impression that AA was keeping a lot of  people sober over
the long haul, judging from the paucity of people with lengthy  continuous
abstinence at AA meetings.  At any rate, I hope you will accept  my apologies
for the rather premature nature of my previous post.  Story of  my life &#8212; running
full speed ahead, sword out, whilst tripping over false  premises.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, David,
<br>
Hey, no problem.
</font>
<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
I do quibble, though, with your take on
a moral inventory</a> &#8212; to start from
a position of asking what you've done &quot;wrong&quot; begs the question of whose
morality you violated. Going at it exactly like
<a href="orange-letters84.html#4th_step" target="newwin99">the Big Book outlined (listing
fears, sex problems, and resentments)</a>, combined with introspection, I was
able to very clearly see that I had been carrying guilt for violating other
people's moral systems which, on further analysis, I decided that I did not
really want to do, anymore. Once I realized that many of the things that used to
make me feel ashamed of myself were really just conditioned by my cultural
and family background, but had little to do with my worth, I was able to branch
out, try new things, and build a moral system of my own, rather than adopt
somebody else's. But, it has to be emphasized, I was a desperately unhappy
person, at that time in my life, and also very young, so maybe the exercise is
only beneficial for basket cases, like I was at that time. (I have read the
12 &amp; 12 &#8212; I dismissed it, for the most part, simply because it was not really
consistent with the Big Book; I imagine that from your perspective, that's
like eschewing incest in favour of cannibalism).

<p>
Again, keep up the good work.  Thank you for  taking the time to respond
to my previous, somewhat impetuous post.  I  continue to believe that even
corrupt people can communicate wise things; to  argue otherwise, is to argue <i>ad
hominem</i>, is it not?

<p>
Peace,<br>
Dave

<font color="blue">
Hi again, Dave,
<p>
If you were able to unburden yourself of some unwarranted guilt by using self-examination and
introspection, then good. I'm really glad to hear that you were able to get rid of some
irrational feelings of guilt. (Really, no sarcasm.)
It is especially good that you built your own moral system, rather than buying a canned package
from some con artists.

<p>
But that isn't what Bill Wilson's &quot;moral inventory&quot; rap was about.

<a href="orange-letters84.html#4th_step" target="newwin99">The example on page 65 of the <i>Big Book</i></a>
is just the tip of the iceberg as far as guilt induction is concerned.
Bill Wilson really went off the deep end on guilt induction and denunciation of alcoholics in
his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
There, he ranted and raved about how bad us alcoholics are, and how
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="newwin992">we are
all guilty of the <i>Seven Deadly Sins</i></a>.
And pride &#8212; like thinking you don't need A.A. &#8212; was the
worst sin of all, Bill said, and leads to all of the other deadly sins.
<p>
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> is basically a non-stop guilt-induction diatribe.
See the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="newwin993">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i> Conspiracy</a>&quot;.

<p>
Oh yes, and Bill used the word &quot;sin&quot; a lot in 12X12.
He dropped the &quot;moral shortcoming&quot; and &quot;defect of character&quot;
euphemisms that he used in the first book, the <i>Big Book</i>,
and just used the word &quot;sin&quot;, finally saying what he really meant all along.
<p>
When Bill Wilson wrote the <i>Big Book</i>, he was
trying to hide the connections and similarities to the Oxford Group, which was a very unpopular
cult due to Frank Buchman's repeated praise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis,
as well as
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="newwin97">its goofy heretical theology</a>, its
habitual gross dishonesty, its
condescending attitude towards non-members (like calling them &quot;pagans&quot;),
and its habit of back-stabbing other churches.
But in 12X12, which was written thirteen years later, after most people forgot about the Oxford Group,
Bill really took the gloves off and rolled up his shirt sleeves
and gave us 192 pages of hard-core cult religion.
<p>
You are right that 12X12 and the <i>Big Book</i> are not the same.
The reason is that Bill Wilson was trying to tone down the religious
content in the <i>Big Book</i>, for publicity purposes.
Bill didn't want to scare away the newcomers and prospective recruits.
Bill Wilson explained that the religious content must be revealed to
the newcomers only very slowly.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or
atheist, make it emphatic that <i>he does not have to agree with
your conception of God</i>.<br>
&nbsp; ... <br>
There is no use arousing any prejudice he may have against certain
theological terms and conceptions about which he may
already be confused.
Don't raise such issues, no matter what your own convictions are.<br>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Notice how Bill Wilson declared that people who disagreed with
Bill Wilson's religion were &quot;prejudiced&quot; and
&quot;confused about theological terms and concepts&quot;.)
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
And again,
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little. They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts &#8212; absolute purity, absolute
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently
too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, pages 74-75.<br>
and<br>
<i>Not-God</i>, Ernest Kurtz, page 46,<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, in the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson actually played down the fanatical
 religiosity of the Oxford Group (which the new A.A. still had), and he
 changed the terminology to hide things.
But Bill Wilson still intended to shove the Oxford Group religion on the alcoholics.

<p>
It is 12X12 where Bill Wilson didn't hold back. There, he and co-author
 Tom Powers gave us the real inside story &#8212; the real A.A. theology
 that they got from the Oxford Group.

<p>
And what the real A.A. theology says is that you are a disgusting sinner, and you should be
ashamed of yourself and confess everything, and wallow in guilt.
(Oh, and then make a surrender and let the group do your thinking for you.)

<p>
Oh, and, about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...even corrupt people can communicate wise things; to  argue
 otherwise, is to argue <i>ad hominem</i>, is it not?&quot;
</font>

<p>
Well, sure, sometimes a &quot;corrupt&quot; person may 
tell the truth or impart wise information, but I wouldn't
bet my life on it.
If somebody usually transmits misinformation, then
I wouldn't be very willing to trust what he says to me.<br>
Consider the source.<br>
Ask about ulterior motives.<br>
Ask, &quot;Who profits?&quot;<br>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Shell shocked<br>

<p>
(Please do not print my email address)

<p>
This April, I will have been sober for 20 years. I am one of those 1 in a 1000 that
you talk about, I guess. From my personal experience, I can say that the statistics
you quote seem pretty dead on. I have watched thousands of people come and go. Most
just do not stay sober, and I agree with the sentiments I have read here: AA does
not work.

<p>
AA is a close-minded organization full of contradictions and religious nonsense. The
sign on the wall says &quot;Think. Think. Think.&quot; but no one really does as far as I can
tell. I have listened to people spout the exact same B.S. in meetings for years,
literally. There is no exploration into anything outside of &quot;AA approved
literature&quot;. Meetings are mundane and repetitive. I cannot remember the last time I
was in one that had any substance. Most are of the variety that I call the &quot;AA
infomercial&quot;. It goes something like this: &quot;When I got to AA...(ramble on about how
lame they were before they got to AA).....now everything is awesome!!!!&quot; I almost
expect fucking Billy Mays to jump out into the room yelling about how I can buy a
Big Book for $9.99.

<p>
For an organization that maintains that spiritual growth is required for sobriety,
they sure do like to recycle the same old stale shit over and over again. Most, if
not all, of my real growth as a person did not really happen in AA at all. I made a
few close friends there and we did real work on our issues...outside of the
program. After all, if you shared anything of any real substance in a meeting, it
would be all over the gossip channel within a few hours.

<p>
The way I stayed sober is almost the exact opposite of the 12 Steps, but of course I
would never say this in a meeting. If you don't tow the party line, you are laughed
at or ostracized. Even though I have almost 20 years, people would surely say &quot;He's
going to be drinking soon.&quot; The fact is, I do have power over alcohol. I believe
that I can change myself for the better. I have the awesome ability (just like
everyone else on the planet) to reinvent myself into whatever I want. I steer my own
ship, not some divine entity. I can listen to myself &lt;gasp!&gt;. I do believe it is
important for me to examine my behavior and grow as a person. The thing is, AA is
not the right vehicle for that. In many ways, it is too superficial to accomplish
much. Don't you find it funny that AA does not follow it's own advice? How many
times have you heard in a meeting, &quot;Doing the same things over and over again and
expecting different results is the definition of insanity&quot;?

<p>
Today, I made the decision that I was never going back to AA again. I had a &quot;moment
of clarity&quot; last night, and saw that I could not ignore the truth any longer. I
threw my Big Book, 12x12, and some other garbage in the trash this morning. Then, I
googled &quot;ex-AA members who are still sober&quot; and found your site. I have been reading
for several hours now. I cannot express how I feel &#8212; sad (that I did not make the
decision to leave sooner), free, but hopeful. I am looking forward to taking a new
direction in my life.

Alas, that is the single toughest reference to find. I've been looking for it for years.
To the best of my recollection now, it was said in a program about drug and alcohol treatment

I think it was on the radio.)

if I drink 5 drinks a week, it's a big drinking week for me &#8212; but I
do have loved ones who are alcoholics, and I used to work in a 12
step-based treatment center, where I took clients to innumerable AA/
NA meetings. At one time, before I knew much about AA or had attended
any meetings, I bought into the argument that AA was &quot;the only thing
that works&quot; and thought of AA as a good program. I went to my first
AA meeting eager to discover how wonderful this program was. Boy, was
I ever disappointed when they couldn't answer the most basic
questions or substantiate any of their claims which were patently
false on their face.

<p>
I am an atheist. My then-boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend but still
friend) had to go to AA meetings (court-ordered), so I took him and
attended many with him. I asked what atheists are to do, as 7 of the
12 steps refer to a Higher Power (god). I was told to read Chapter 3,
which boils down to 3 words: get a god. No, I'm not going to. Why
should I pray to something that doesn't exist and in which I have
absolutely no belief? I've thought through these things through time
and time again. I was raised as a Christian and even went to a church
school for 7 years, taking religion classes and attending chapel
every day. (It was a combination of world history and religion
classes that cemented my atheism.)

<p>
Then I was told I could make anything, even my dog, my higher power.
Okay, I'm going to turn my life and my will over to MY DOG. Yeah,
that makes perfect sense.  I might lead us into homelessness because
I spent all my time playing with my dog and taking her for rides, but
my dog would get steaks every night, per her will. How that was going
to keep me sober, or help me deal with my alcoholic boyfriend, was
not apparent to me, unless I couldn't afford to buy booze because all
my money had to go to buying Lola steaks.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that's funny.
</font>
<p>
When I interviewed at the treatment program, I was dismayed how
little these LCDCs (licensed chemical dependency counselors) knew
about anything other than AA. They knew that AA alternatives existed,
but didn't know anything about them other than to assert, &quot;Oh, none
of those work.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alas, that is the tragedy of the &quot;treatment industry&quot;.
There are so many &quot;training programs&quot;
and &quot;associates' degrees&quot;
that teach conselors little more than how to recruit new members
for Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>
I looked into Al-Anon. But since the first 3 statements (steps) were
totally false when applied to me (I was NOT powerless over alcohol,
my life was NOT unmanageable, I did NOT believe that a power greater
than myself was the only way to give me sanity, and I was NOT going
to turn my life and my will over to my dog, Zeus, Hera, Buddha,
Orion, Dionysus, or that 30,000 year old dude that Scientologists
believe in &#8212; Xenu?), I realized that Al-Anon really didn't have
anything to offer me other than stuff that I totally disagreed with.
As for the 12 steps, and the insistence that alcoholism/addiction was
a &quot;physical disease to which the answer was spiritual treatment&quot;,
they fell completely flat in the &quot;does this sound true?&quot; test. It
didn't pass even the first, most rudimentary bullshit test. If I
didn't buy the package of goods Christianity and Islam want to foist
upon me, why should I buy the patently false package of goods that AA
wanted me to swallow?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, nasty old Scientology evil Galactic Overlord Xenu
would have to be at least 60 million years old, because
Xenu supposedly dumped those frozen aliens into the volcano
on Earth 60 million years ago &#8212; which stuck us with millions of
unhappy ghosts who cause us no end of problems.

<p>
Yes, Al-Anon is even crazier than A.A. in some ways. You don't even have to
be an addict, or have a physical problem in order to need the cult.
You have a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;
because you care about somebody who has a drug or alcohol problem, so you must
confess all of your sins and surrender to God...
Nuts.

</font>
<p>
In one sense, I did pay attention to one platitude that's often
bandied about at Al-Anon meetings, and maybe AA meetings as well,
whenever objections are raised to the indoctrination: &quot;Take what
works and leave the rest&quot;. I took what I believe works &#8212; a support
group of people who are facing the same kind of problems (whether
they be problems with addiction or problems coping with addicted
people &#8212; and left the rest: everything else, the whole program.
Having said that, I still say that if someone's facing the choice
between warming a seat in a bar, and warming a seat in an AA meeting,
the AA meeting is the better choice, just as long as they don't buy
into the B.S. and just take the comraderie of other people saying
some version of &quot;hang in there, bro&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
True. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to go to A.A. meetings for
years and not absorb the dogma.
</font>
<p>
I started a SMART Recovery meeting in San Antonio, Texas, but I
couldn't get many people to attend, and I didn't really have time to
devote to it.  However, I've got half a mind to write to local
judges, telling them that AA really doesn't work and forced AA
attendance is a direct violation of the principle of separation of
church and state, and telling them about SMART and offering to mentor
people in the SMART program (even though I haven't worked it myself,
and don't know near as much as I should about it, but I figure what I
do know, plus my experience working in addiction treatment, has got
to be better than what's in store at the average AA/NA meeting). I do
think that many judges are very frustrated, as they agree that
filling our prisons with people whose problem is addiction is not the
right answer, but the only answer those judges know about is 12 step
based programs. In thinking about what I would say (as I think I need
to be short and sweet in saying, &quot;I want to offer an alternative to
12 step meetings for alcoholics/addicts in the court system&quot; but at
the same time, I need to offer a plethora of footnotes when I say
that &quot;AA doesn't work&quot;), I thought about mentioning that AA is no
more effective than weekly pattycake meetings, but I think I'd need a
source to back up that claim.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Starting a SMART meeting sounds like a good thing.  I would post some
questions on their forum and see what people can suggest in the way of help.<br>

Subject:  	Re: Religious Roots<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
AA has helped an incredibly lot of people &#8212; saved their lives in fact, and
re-built them back onto a good way, reconnected to their spirutuality, to
themselves and to others. To liken AA to some sort of religious cult is
denograting a very valuable service, which, if a new person just considering
AA reads, may turn them off significantly. That's what sickened me. That
someone speeling off their intellectual opinions might actually cause
significant harm to someone else who reads it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Sundance,
<p>
Alas, those numbers about the millions of people whom A.A. has helped are
bogus, faked, and phony as a 3-dollar bill.
A.A. has a success rate that is much closer to zero.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success">
Only about five percent of the alcoholics who come to A.A. stay around for one year</a>, and the other 95% leave.
And not all of those 5% who keep coming back actually get and stay sober. And then the attrition
continues. Barely one in a thousand makes it for 20 years.
<p>
But A.A. cannot even claim those five percent, because five percent per year is the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg">normal rate at which
alcoholics quit drinking on their own</a>.  You will get the same low success rate from any other
treatment method, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">from no help and no treatment at all</a>.
Send them to the Baskin Robbins Ice Cream parlor, or the local Tiddly-Winks Society, and you will get
the same success rate.

<p>
Worst of all,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
A.A. actually raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
raises the rate of binge drinking</a>.
<p>
Another letter that just came in is
<a href="orange-letters98.html#20year">
from a 20-year A.A. oldtimer</a>, and he also says that A.A. does not work.

<p>
The rest of your rap about spirituality is irrelevant. There is nothing spiritual about lying to sick
people about what might heal them, and that is what Bill Wilson did in the <i>Big Book</i>,
and that's what A.A. still does at the start of every meeting:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail....&quot;
</font>

<p>
And then, telling alcoholics the truth won't &quot;cause significant harm&quot; to them.
(That's
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_no_truth">
the standard cult characteristic of &quot;You can't tell the truth.&quot;</a>)
The crazy religious dogma of A.A., like telling alcoholics that they are powerless over alcohol,
is what really causes a lot of deaths.
And then telling the sick people not to take their doctor-prescribed medications really puts the
frosting on the cake.

<p>
Lastly, I do not express &quot;intellectual opinions&quot;. I collect and report facts.
There is a difference.
</font>
<p>
<a name="any_god"> </a>
ALL religions have certain elements as contained in AA &#8212; the faith and
surrender to the guidance of a &quot;higher power&quot; WHATEVER YOU CONSIDER IT TO
BE. Cults are very prescriptive, and call the higher power something
partiucular, have specific beliefs, rituals etc. AA is very open, and
embraces all beliefs, even agnostics &#8212; who take the &quot;higher power&quot; to mean
the fellowship. They totally abstain from materialism, only taking small
(gold coin) contributions to pay for minimal expenses, and use humble
community halls etc.

<p>
<font color="blue">
This is all actually pretty standard cult fare.
<ul>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender">The idea that you must
&quot;surrender to God&quot; is pure Buchmanism</a>,
and serves only to make you a passive, obedient and unthinking member of a religious cult.

<p><li> The idea that you can surrender to <i>any</i> &quot;Higher Power&quot;
and it will be wonderful spirituality is nonsense. What if someone believes
that Satan is the Master of This World, and that evil rules this world?
How will surrendering to Satan and Evil work out?
<p>
Or, what if someone believes that Reverend Sun Myung Moon really is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ?
Or Bagwan Shree Rajneesh is God. Or Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada?
Or Lafayette Ronald Hubbard is the Savior of Mankind?
<p>
Are you going to then instruct such a believer in
&quot;the correct beliefs&quot;, and &quot;the correct faith&quot;, or will you
say that their &quot;Higher Power&quot; is okay?
<p>
So, will Satan or Moon or Rajneesh or Prabhupada or Hubbard <i>really</i>
get people sober and deliver miracles
and guide people in Step Eleven?
<p>
Oh, and remember that A.A. claims that any Higher Power is okay, as long as it makes sense to the newcomer.<br>
But what if the newcomer is insane? Lots of them are, you know.  The A.A. Step Two even says:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>[We] Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b>&quot;
</font><br>
So what &quot;Higher Power&quot; is restoring that insane person to sanity?<br>
And how could an insane person chose the correct Higher Power to restore him to sanity before he gets sane?

<p>
And then there is the problem that the Twelve Steps declare that your Higher Power will deliver
miracles on demand, like restoring people to sanity, and removing all of their defects of character
and moral shortcomings, and talking to them in s&eacute;ances and giving them power.
Oh, and of course, managing their unmanageable lives and making them quit drinking alcohol,
and taking care of their wills and their lives for them.

<p>
So what if someone believes in a version of God Who does not deliver
miracles on demand &#8212; which is true of most
branches of Christianity, Buddhism, Vedantic religions, Islam, Judaism, and everything else...?
Very few religions are childish enough, and superstitious enough, to believe that they can get
miracles on demand just by praying or begging for them.
Few mature religions believe in Santa Claus spirituality.
<p>
So how are the 12 Steps supposed to work if God won't work the Steps the way that Frank Buchman and
Bill Wilson declared that God works?
You see, A.A. actually requires a very specific kind of God, even while declaring that you can have
any god you want.

<p><li>
Furthermore, A.A. is most assuredly not &quot;very open, and embraces all beliefs, even agnostics...&quot;
Obviously, you don't remember
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">the &quot;We Agnostics&quot; chapter of the <i>Big Book</i></a>
very well.
There, Bill Wilson declared that you must stop being an agnostic and start believing his way, or else.
Try reading Chapter Four again.
<p>
The whole &quot;any Higher Power&quot; rap is just another
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod">A.A. bait-and-switch trick</a>.

<p><li>
Oh, and
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_hypocrisy">it is standard cult behavior</a>
to insist that &quot;We aren't a cult; just those other people are.&quot;
Every cult I've ever visited said the same thing.

<p><li>
The fact that many local groups are impoverished doesn't change the fact that
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">the A.A. headquarters commits felony perjury</a>
to steal more millions of dollars and to put in prison A.A. members who are giving away
A.A. literature for free or selling it extremely inexpensively.
Apparently, the A.A. headquarters will do anything to protect its profits.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters65.html#AA_financials">The leaders of A.A. in the New York headquarters</a>
(in The Interchurch Center)
get anything from $70,000 to $125,000 or more per year. They aren't impoverished.
The poor little local group that meets in the church basement is merely the smiley-face front for a rich,
powerful organization that commits crimes to get more money.
<p>
And that doesn't even consider the great number of treatment centers that act as A.A. recruiting agencies
for only $1500 to $40,000 per &quot;12-Step treatment&quot;.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

</ul>
</font>
<p>
Anyway, I'm not interested in debating your views, just wanted to give you
some feedback that I don't think its what you're doing is good.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It isn't a matter of &quot;my views&quot;, it's a matter of FACTS, like the fact that A.A. does not
work to sober up alcoholics, and A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics.

<p>

<p> Frame 1- Since AA's earliest days, it has experienced high drop-out rates.
&quot;At first, nearly every alcoholic we approached began to slip, if indeed
he sobered up at all.&quot; William G. Wilson, 1957

<p> Frame 2- &quot;You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to take the
bait.&quot; William G, Wilson, 1952

<p> Frame 3- &quot;The summer I worked in Akron with Doc Smith, we tore about
frantically, and only bagged two who made the grade.&quot; William G. Wilson,
Pass It On, page 225

<p> Frame 4- AA triennial surveys compiled between 1977 and 1989 revealed
that AA experienced horrendous drop-out rates. For every hundred who
attended one AA meeting, about 40 didn't return.

<p> Frame 5- At one month, fully 81% of the original 100 were no longer
attending. At 3 months, attrition had increased to 90%. At 6 months, 93%
had left.

<p> Frame 6- At one year, 95% of all who had attended at least one AA meeting
had quit attending. A 1994 study by AA Australia found the exact same
number.

<p> Frame 7- AA proponants try to mask this incredibly poor retention rate by
eliminating those who don't stay for at least 3 months, the point at which
the most dramatic decline in attendance has already occurred.

<p> Frame 8- They cite a 56% one-year retention rate for those who continue AA
for at least 3 months. While this may be accurate, it is based on a mere
10% of the entire pool of initial AA attendees.

<p> Frame 9- This is the statistical equivalent of  doing a one-year cancer
treatment survival survey of one hundred people, while eliminating the 90
who died within the first 3 months of the treatment, and then proclaiming
that the treatment had a 50% one-year survival rate.

<p> Frame 10- Notice that the triennial surveys draw no conclusions about how
many people stay sober in AA, or out of AA, or in spite of AA. This video
does not attempt to equate retention with success or failure.

<p> Frame 11- AA's current membership claims, average years sober for the
membership, numbers of years sober for each catagory, and numbers of
people at each month and year of sobriety all indicate that same 5% annual
retention rate. The numbers all work.

<p> Frame 12- For every one hundred new or returning people who came to AA
today and picked up a 24-hour chip, only five of them will still be
attending one year from today. That was true in 1935, and it is still true
today.

<p> Frame 13- Deny it, justify it, cherry-pick it, explain it away, or just
plain ignore it, the 5% one-year retention rate for AA has always been a
reality.

Hello again, Mike,

<p>
Yes, I saw it. Neat. Good stuff.
I finally got my Windoze machine fixed, so
I can again see things like flash videos.

<p>
The weather here is bearable, just bearable.  Very rainy now,
which is keeping me indoors and actually causing me to get some
more email answered.

<p>
The heavy snows of Christmas are gone. The geese are really happy
about that. They couldn't get anything to eat when everything
was buried under snow. They were starving for more than a week,
so I went and fed them oatmeal and rice.
Most of the time, I was the only one crazy enough to go out in
the snow and feed them, so they got to waiting for me.

<p>
It's an experience to see a hundred geese, ducks, and sea gulls
all lined up and waiting for you and
staring at you expectantly, hoping for you
to come and give them something to eat.
It's enough to make you glad you came.

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Roger H.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	You write a lot about which you do not know!<br>

<p>
Your opinions of Alcoholics Anonymous are based on zero experience of
Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Roger,
<p>
Apparently you have not even read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction to the web site</a>.
There, I explain that I've been to a lot of A.A. and N.A. meetings.

</font>
<p>
Your translation of what you think is occuring, try going to a meeting,
several different meetings?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Been there, done that.
</font>
<p>
It's easy to pick on an outfit that will not defend itself.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You and many other A.A. members seem to be doing an okay job of defending A.A.

</font>
<p>
<a name="AA_works_1"> </a>
AA has helped millions, there is no leader and no rules, gee you seemed to
have left that out.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, A.A. has not &quot;helped millions&quot;.
That's just another untrue cult slogan, totally untrue. I just answered the same statement
in a letter from another A.A. member,
<a href="orange-letters98.html#Sundance2">here</a>.

<p>
No rules? Nonsense. Start with &quot;Don't drink alcohol.&quot;<br>
Then there is &quot;Get a sponsor, read the <i>Big Book</i>, and go to meetings.&quot;
<br>
And then there is, &quot;Don't criticize the Program.&quot;
<br>
And &quot;Don't tell the truth about the history of Alcoholics Anonymous or Bill Wilson...&quot;
<br>
That's just for starters. There are lots of rules.

<p>
And A.A. has leaders.
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#Trustees">The leaders of A.A.</a>
sit in the Interchurch Center in New York City and
<a href="orange-letters65.html#AA_financials">receive anything from $70,000 to $125,000 per year</a>.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>
<p>
AA clearly states they do not have a monopoly on recovery, a member is also
encouraged to get a god of their own understanding, any kind of god they
wish.  ANYKIND.  Also AA does not recruit members, DO YOU UNDERSTAND, AA
DOES NOT SEEK OUT MEMBERS, they are there for those who want help, PERIOD.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Bill Wilson wrote that A.A. does not have a monopoly, but he also wrote that A.A. is the only
way and you are
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_warrant">signing your own death warrant</a>
if you don't <i>Work The Steps</i> right.
It's just another A.A. bait-and-switch trick.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">Look here</a>.
<p>
Again, I just answered the same A.A. slogan about &quot;any god of your understanding&quot;
in the previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters98.html#any_god">here</a>

<p>
And not seeking out members? You've got to be kidding. Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
People are sentenced and coerced and pushed into A.A. by everything from criminal courts to 12-Step-based
treatment programs, and A.A. encourages such coercion.
See this:
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">Aggressive Recruiting</a>.

</font>
<p>
Recovery begins for each person when they admit they have a problem, you
must feel really proud knowing you may have gotten in the way of someone
seeking help with your critisism of an outfit that will not defend itself.

<p>
<font color="blue">

You are defending A.A., and praising A.A. as well,
so please don't give me that ridiculous slogan about how A.A. cannot defend itself.
<p>
The real facts show that A.A. is what gets in the way of people recovering.
When A.A. was put to the test, it was worse than useless.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
A.A. raised the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">
A.A. raised the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
A.A. raised the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
<a name="disservice_list"> </a>
By the way, you are now claiming that someone criticizing A.A. or telling the truth about the bad
parts of A.A. is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;getting in the way of someone seeking help&quot;</font>.
But that directly contradicts your earlier claim that A.A. does not have a monopoly on recovery.
Recommending more sensible and sane and effective
recovery methods cannot possibly be &quot;getting in the way of recovery&quot;
unless A.A. is the only way to recover, and steering people away from A.A. will prevent them
from getting sober.
<p>
But that's what true-believer A.A. members routinely claim:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters73.html#disservice">&quot;You have done a great disservice in putting this vile stuff up on the net.&quot;</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters74.html#disservice"> &quot;Telling addicts that simply their own will power will conquer their addiction does them a great disservice.&quot;</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters54.html#disservice">&quot;I feel you are doing AA a dis-service for those who CHOOSE to try it&quot;</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice">
&quot;My dog demonstrates more care and responsibility than you do. Do you think
you are doing mankind a favor by publishing this propaganda garbage? Hardly.&quot;</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters6.html#dangerous">&quot;I think your message is dangerous, both to yourself and to others.&quot;</a>
<li> There are many more such claims of &quot;disservice to alcoholics&quot;
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin776">here</a>.
</ul>
<p>
It's just a standard bait-and-switch trick: Start the letter by claiming &quot;we have no monopoly&quot;, and end with
declaring that criticizing A.A. hurts those who are seeking sobriety.

</font>
<p>
A way of living better than the path you are on is a path you could clearly
use.

<p>
<font color="blue">

And you have a good day, too.

From:  	&quot;jaune s.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	why<br>

<p>
What i want to know is, what happened, that was so bad that it made you want to
spend all of this time researching and  finding faults and something wrong with A.A.
Did you walk in the rooms with a certain expectation? If you see this as a problem,
can you offer a solution? After all, if A.A. is such a problem, can you tell others
what is your solution to the problem of alcoholism? Can you help me and other
A.A'ers to understand why you feel this badly about it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jaune,
<p>
What happened? Well, I discovered that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">
A.A. doesn't actually work to make alcoholics quit drinking</a>,
nor does Narcotics Anonymous work to get addicts off of drugs. It's a hoax.
<p>
You want experiences? Okay, here are some experiences:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">Intro to A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">Bait-and-switch treatment</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">Friends driven away from
help by the 12-step nonsense</a>
</ol>
<p>
We have often talked about what works better than A.A. and the 12-Step routine.
Here is a list of such discussions:

<p>
I myself have been sober for 10 years with AA/N/A. Sobriety is an
attitude rather then quantity of time. Seven years are something to be
applauded in any state, with or without AA/ NA. But sobriety is not
only a state of being but also a state of mind. It is the way we
interact with ourselves and others. Anyone can remain clean but the
question is, can they do it with serenity, well being, and happiness.
Sobriety more than anything is an attitude. An attitude that allows
other concepts and ideas, no matter how much we understand, dont
understand them, want or dont want them to be.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your 10 years of sobriety.
<p>
Sorry, but I'm not buying the jargon. Sobriety is a state of mind that is
caused by the lack of alcohol or drugs in your body, period.
The rest of your rap is an attempt to sell the A.A. religion's definition of a
&quot;serene&quot; and &quot;spiritual&quot; state of mind as sobriety. 
They are not equal or equivalent at all. That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#equality">False Equality</a>
<p>
Furthermore, the A.A. program does not create any such happy serene state of mind. Check out the
letter from a 20-year A.A. old timer who just commented on that,
<a href="orange-letters98.html#20year">here</a>.

<p>
And I am reminded of what a 24-year old-timer wrote some years ago:
<a href="orange-letters.html#angry">
&quot;I have also noted how angry so many of the 'old timers' are.&quot;</a>
You should read his letter, too.

</font>
<p>
Recovery is an
experience and attitude. Yes there are people in Self Help Groups that
are conceded, pathological liars, rude , abrupt , and self centered.
But then again, that is also a description of an addict. The old saying
is &quot; You can take the boy out of the country, but you cannot take the
country out of the boy. It is saying that just because someone is not
using/drinking doesnt mean that they are not acting like it. It is the
people in AA who are geniune, cognizant of their deficts, and aware of
and are activiely changing their maladaptive behaviors that keep this
program going, and are the members to befriend, I have met many people
in AA over the past 10 and almost 11 years that have jilted me and
taken me for granted, but then again, i have met alot of people in and
beyond my sobriety and addiction, who are not members of AA that have
treated me the same way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You recognize that many of the A.A. members are less than angelic and less
than spiritual teachers, and some are even downright sociopathic, but there is no
system or set of rules for preventing those people from becoming sponsors
and teachers, and telling the newcomers how to live and how to get sober, and
not to take their medications.
And there is nothing to stop those newly-minted sponsors from abusing
their sponsees.
That is one of the big reasons why A.A. does not actually work to help
alcoholics get sober.

</font>
<p>
But my will not only to stay sober,
but to be happy while doing it is stronger than anything and anyone
with the exception of God ( my belief). Meaning i dont allow the
negative people in AA to overshadow the Positive people in AA.  When
going to AA or NA, it is kind of like looking at Art or a Painting, the
picture of what is lye's in the eye of the beholder, if the beholder
has a negative attitude, the painting will be ugly and disproportiante,
if the beholder has a positive attitude the painting will be beautiful.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I agree that it is your will to stay sober that keeps you sober. &quot;The Program&quot; is irrelevant, and even
harmful.

<p>
The rest of that rap, about how A.A. looks good or bad depending on your mental attitude,
is just an attempt to use the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a>,
as in,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just your opinion versus my opinion. It's just one viewpoint versus another viewpoint.&quot;
</font>
<p>
A.A. has some very specific bad side effects that have nothing to do with your attitude while looking
at A.A., like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
raising the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">
raising the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
raising the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
And then you might want to look at the thirteenth-stepping of young girls,
and exploitation of newcomers,
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">here</a>.
That is unfortunately also a part of &quot;The Real A.A.&quot;, and &quot;The Real N.A.&quot; too.
And it doesn't change, or go away, depending on how you look at it.
</font>
<p>
It seems that a cynical attitude would allow
people to see that painting or bigger picture as negative therefore
probably many other things in their life seem negative, I cant demean them for that
because there was a time, even in sobriety, that my attitude
towards life was the same, but AA changed that.
<p>
AA is not for
everyone, just like everyone does not like country music, but that does
not give them the right to belittle anothers way of life. It just means
we are different. I beg of those who have had negative experiences in
AA to try and go back with a better, and maybe different attittude and
then judge for themselves.  Do not take anyone persons advice, get
different opinions, and form your own, but no matter what it is, if AA
is not for you or if it seems like it is not for you, dont close your
mind to anything, it is our closed minds and narrow views that allowed
us to remain intoxicated.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are trying an <a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a>.
You might as well be saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Cyanide Koolaid isn't for everyone. Some like it better than others.
Don't close your mind to anything.
Don't let one negative experience deter you.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
