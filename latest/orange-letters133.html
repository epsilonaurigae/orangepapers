So many people have different opinions about the subject or addiction, but it seems
to me that change is in the air?! That many people are demanding something better
than AA. When the truth starts to become: people w/out treatment do better (I
believe it) because between the times I would binge &amp; the times I wanted to be sober
(I was better w/out AA) doing it alone. I believe one reason I got so sick at AA is
because it took me so far down the wrong path in relationship to (my truth &amp; the
truth) &amp; left me lost on the trail.
After the love-bombing (one-two years) AA did
turn abusive on me &amp; abandon me (during the last year).

<p>
I have found my way back to
the path of reality.
I don't worship either of you like people do AA, but I know
both of you saved my life from AA. All the things AA was saying &amp; doing to me
(verbal crazy making like Patrica Evans talks about) and then denying doing  were
items that both of you have exposed the truth to the light. The truth is where
sanity lives.

<p>
PS: I do not know if I sent this to Mike? but this is what a Dr. put my sister on
after she finally quit her psych meds (I have nothing against meds if they work &amp;
they are the right ones, but I do have something against meds if they are screwing a
person up worse!) My sister has been on them a month &amp; she notices a huge
improvement. I have been trying them for a week &amp; feel better. You don't take them
forever maybe 3-6 months. Just wanted to share.

Hi Anne,
<p>
It's good to hear from you. Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.
I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better. It brightens
up the morning cup of coffee to hear that I was able to help in some small way.
<p>
I totally agree about the meds &#8212; if they are helping the patient, then that is good.
If they are hurting the patient, then discontinue the medications and find something
better. And that is just what competent doctors do.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

Hi Orange,

<p>
I've been trawling through your site again with the intention of doing some
amateur proof-reading.

<p>
Here's a couple of typos/spelling mistakes I have noticed.

<p>
In your essay 'Heresy of the 12 Steps', you have Bangladesh spelt
Bengladesh, likewise Chechniya should be spelt Chechnya.

<p>
In 'The Bait and Switch Con Game', in your description of Bait and Switch
no. 32, you have a  quote from 'Pass it on'. 'Pysical' should be spelt
'physical'.

<p>
I hope all is well.

Subject:  	Hello and Thanks<br>
Sender:  	Simon<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I've been reading your excellent work for a few weeks. In truth, I was
first here about 18 months ago. At that time I was fully embroilled in
AA, racking up a few months sober, getting drunk again, in and out of
treatment, hating 12-step meetings but dragging myself along 2 or 3 times
a week. I was desperate to stay sober and, though I just couldn't see
how the 12-steps had anything to do with staying sober, I believed what
I was being told by health professionals, counsellors, family, friends
and of course other steppers; that AA was the only way and that it would
work if I worked it, and that if I didn't work it I would die. I sat in
endless meetings staring at those faded 12 step scrolls desperately
trying to understand what the steps had to do with staying sober. I
think also that I wanted to find somewhere where I &quot;belonged&quot;. I'd never
really felt that I belonged anywhere before. When I found I didn't
belong in the rooms either I became seriously depressed.

<p>
When I first visited your site back then I still believed that AA had to
be right and that I was the problem (after all that's what I was being
told by &quot;professionals&quot;), I admit I was angry with you. I wanted your
research to be flawed (of course it's not), or I wanted to conclude that
you were nasty, mad, resentful, not really an addict/alcoholic, dry
drunk, etc. etc. After all you are regularly accused of all these things
by 12-steppers, many of whom seem not to have given your site more than
a cursory glance (not even your autobiographical notes). I see now of
course that you're a decent, intelligent, compassionate guy (and an
animal lover too) who dares to tell the truth about the 12 step cartel
which is failing addicts and society so shamefully (shamelessly?).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Simon,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>
I went to my last AA meeting about 9 months ago. I never really decided
to stop going. I just found myself doing some other good stuff in my
life which was clearly going to help me stay sober and couldn't find the
time for tedious, depressing meetings. In fact until a few weeks ago I
still found myself thinking, with some guilt &quot;Perhaps I should get to a
meeting sometime.&quot; Now I know I will never go to a meeting again. In
fact to do so would undoubtedly jeopardise my sobriety. Coming to your
site has helped me reach that decision, so thanks for that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are welcome. Personally, I think that going to another meeting
would be just an unnecessary pain.  I have a hard time silently sitting
through all of the opening lies, like &quot;RARELY have we seen
a person fail....&quot;

</font>
<p>
One experience you related did particularly strike a chord, so I thought
I'd mention it. I can't find the comment in your letters section now,
but you'll be able to date it because you wrote it on your 5th sober
anniversary. You were wondering whether to go to your first NA meeting
in ages to collect a 5 year chip (did you go?). You just couldn't bear
the thought of people taking the credit, on behalf of NA, for your clean
time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I never went and got that coin or keytag. Or any others, ever again.
I finally managed to let go of my attachment to drunk junk.
Then, at the 7-year point, a friend who is an ex-member sent me his 7-year coin, just for
the hell of it. I suppose that might be the last one, ever.

</font>
<p>
Now I sat in meetings for more years than I care to remember, looking
miserable, bored and anxious (because that's how meetings made me feel).
Then, as I mentioned, I found other things in life that lifted my
negativity and helped me to stay sober. In one of the last meetings I
attended some guy noticed my happier disposition and commented on it.
&quot;You look happier these days.&quot; I said &quot;Yes, I am, thanks.&quot; You can guess
his response. &quot;You see. This program works.&quot; I was angry at the time.
Not any more, It helped me realise just how totally irrelevant the
program is to my sobriety.

<p>
Incidentally, I don't think chips, coins, keyrings are handed out so
much here in the UK. One has to go to certain specific meetings to
collect them. The only one I have is a Cocaine Anonymous newcomer's
keyring. Now I've put a whole lot of nasty chemicals into my body over
the years but amazingly have never taken cocaine, despite its apparent
ubiquity here in London (detectable in the river Thames). I was in a
treatment centre and attendance at all 12 step meetings was mandatory.
Even people there for eating disorders, traumatic disorders or just
depression were pretty much forced to attend. So I was pushed up at the
end of the meeting to collect my keyring and a round of applause. How
crazy. In the view of the 12 step evangelists in the treatment industry
there is no problem that cannot be solved by the program. That's very
sinister, not to mention the vast amounts of money, both public and
private being poured into ineffective recovery programs. Still, better
for me not to get on to the subject of the treatment industry scandal.
I'll be here typing all day. Another time maybe.

Snake oil would supposedly cure anything.
Of course, it was highly questionable just how many snakes were actually in that
&quot;snake oil&quot;...)

Hi

<p>
I just read this excerpt of your  writing on amazon:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005043/http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/R1BOV3EQEHHA3B" target="newwin31">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/R1BOV3EQEHHA3B</a><br>
and
I must say it expressed exactly what I felt 8 years ago at an AA meeting
and yesterday at an SLAA (sex and love addicts).  The room was full of
women who, in my opinion, are in desperate need of thorough
psychological or psychiatric help, myself included.  And all they did
was &quot;share&quot; for five minutes, repeat the indoctrination steps, and give
up to a higher power.
<p>
First I thought it was only sad, but today I
think it's actually dangerous. I wrote an e-mail to the chairwoman but
she probably will not understand what my objections were.
<p>
Anyway, I
enrolled in a program of a scientifically based psychological institute,
which helped me cure my OCD. No groups, no higher power, just working
hard at leaving destructive patterns.

<p>
I am gonna read your website to avoid making the mistake going to AA,
NA, SLAA or whatever anymore. I am glad both at AA and SLAA one meeting
was enough for me to see what they are all about.  I am 8 years clean
and sober now, with the help of plain old cognitive therapy.

Keep up the good work.

Just stumbled upon your site looking to prove to a friend that
Bill Wilson wrote most of the Big Book, not the so called 100 drunks.
I'm talking about the first 150 pages. I think you proved me correct.

</font>
<p>
Holy crap! What a web book. I'm sober 20 years and credit the fact that
I made friends that don't drink to long term sobriety. It's too bad there
is so much BS along the way in AA. I have not gone to many meetings in
the last 15 years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, friends who don't drink are a big help. First off, you don't have to explain
to them why you aren't drinking. They already know. Then they don't expect you
to drink, and they don't think you are strange if you don't drink with them.
It just makes things a lot easier.

I recently started going to OA meetings because my eating is messed up.
(Sugar was my first addiction, if that's possible.) OA is even more
messed up because most of the people are FAT. I never saw a drunk at an
AA meeting, but lots of fatties at OA. I think I can lose weight out of
spite by going to those meetings, and I might just make some formerly
fat friends. Unfortunately very few thin OA's don't believe that they
got thin by putting down the fork. They are more into the cult than AA's.

Hi Terrance,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Alan,
</font>
<p>
Speaking out about the insanity that is 12 step ideology masquerading as
treatment continues to not win me any friends in the 'treatment'
community. At this point, I'd say it's hurt my career more than helped
it. Steppers really do not like their snake oil criticized especially
when it's lining their pockets.

<p>
One of the places I work receives a lot of referrals from a local
outpatient clinic that's heavy, heavy into AA ideology. There have been
a few times, when patients from this clinic speak in such self-defeating
AA-speak and/or falsehoods that I find myself challenging their
disempowering belief system and presenting a few facts. I have never
told a patient not attend AA or to leave the treatment center. I have
never uttered a single negative statement about the treatment facility
in question. And bear in mind, this clinic is so steeped in AA they
still use parts of the Big Book in their curriculum! How far gone do you
have to be as a supposed professional to read from that book ALOUD and
then REPRINT it for handouts?!? It's like 1982 over there. Haha. Most of
the counselors sound more like glorified sponsors than clinicians and
spend more time talking about themselves than the people they're
supposedly treating.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, and the &quot;treatment program&quot; that I went to featured a &quot;First Step&quot; that was
just a xeroxed section of the Narcotics Anonymous training manual.
The funny thing is, it looked a lot more like the Fourth Step, because the clients
were supposed to list in detail everything that was wrong with them.
There were lot of forms and lists to be filled out with your various faults
and shortcomings and crimes. Then
you were supposed to read it all aloud to the rest of the group. (And that's a non-confidential
Fifth Step.)
<p>
Fortunately, my &quot;counselor&quot; got sick, and was replaced by a substitute counselor
who did things differently, and I never did that part of the &quot;program&quot;.
Maybe that helped me to succeed.  There was less damage to the ego to repair.
<p>
By the way, the &quot;counselor&quot; who pushed that confession program on his
clients is the one who
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="newwin34">went to prison for raping children</a>.

</font>
<p>
Apparently, my views got back to the owner of the agency who
subsequently called the owner of the group I practice with and stated
that if he didn't put a muzzle on me all referrals would cease and
desist. I was mildly reprimanded and encouraged to be &quot;more middle of
the road.&quot; I didn't bother answering the charges as my employer was
probably more concerned with his own bottom line than any
ethical/clinical issue.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wouldn't &quot;middle of the road&quot; be dividing the clients' time
between A.A. and Scientology training?
</font>
<p>
Of course, the glaring issue (at least to me) is that it is perfectly
A-OKAY for their 'clinicians' to present AA and only AA as a means to
'recovery' at the expense of anything else. It is of no consequence that
they are AA members. No conflict of interest there, apparently. Strange
times, that I am the one out of line. My experience has been that this
sort of practice is the norm in 12 step facilities. There is virtually
no room for any other school of thought that conflicts with steppism.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it seems to be the norm.
Paul Roman and Terry Blum at the
Institute for Behavioral Research, Athens, Georgia,
did the <i>National Treatment Center Study Report</i> in 1997,
and they found that 93.1% of all treatment centers in the U.S.A. used
the 12-Step approach to treating alcoholism and drug addictions.

</font>
<p>
I find myself biting my tongue more and more, just in order to stay
employed. The brainwashing shell-game that is the 12 step industry is
such that the outspoken critic, in this case me, is viewed as the
extremist. I wonder what kind of reaction the first guy to speak out
against segregation got.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, probably about the same.

Interesting personal note: just got in touch with my birth father's
family (I was adopted.) His sister tells me that he has cardiomyopathy
and is basically drinking himself to death. Can't get a transplant
because he won't quit drinking. He monkeys around with his coumadin in
order to drink more. His father was also heavy/problem drinker. So
that's at least three generations of alcohol dependence. The third being
me. Also interesting that my adoptive parents, who have raised me since
birth and were/are great parents, were never anything more than light
social drinkers. Evidence of the genetic link? Looks that way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it looks that way to me too. I'm third-generation too.
</font>
<p>
Also interesting is that there are SIX generations of doctors in the
family history and several generations of musicians. I'm certainly not a
doctor but as a licensed clinician I count myself as a member of the
helping profession/health care world and prior to my clinical work I was
a performing musician in NYC, a singer-songwriter. Pretty wild.

more importantly, got married for the first time a couple months ago!

I'm doing fine. I have a nice suntan, and have been feeding a bunch of goslings

Most of the goslings have grown to nearly adult size now, and have gone upriver,

Subject:  	Staying off alcohol<br>
Sender:  	Lynn C.<br>

<p>
Hi Orange, Thank you so much for your papers.  I have attended AA off
and on now for almost 36 years and have remained on and off alcohol for
36 years.  Yes, I guess you will agree with me that AA DOES NOT WORK.  I
too questioned all their psychobabble and pseudo crap for years &#8212; in my
mind of course because if one dares to speak aloud you will be shunned &#8212; 
and told you are &quot;in denial&quot; whatever that sack load of shit is supposed
to mean.
<p>
No, I am not a bad person, I do not need to confess all my
sins, certainly no more than the next person, I do not have a higher
power (even if it is a No.9 bus????!!!!!!!!!!) yes I have actually been
told to believe that.  I do not need religion, I do not need to hear any
more of their stories, interesting they may be at first but its like
seeing a film or reading a book twenty times, one gets BORED.  I do not
need to attend any more dreadful meetings that tell me &quot;keep coming
back&quot;.  I am a perfectly rounded human being, I am a totally fabulous
person that likes socialising with friends, family and workmates.  I
love parties, I love going out for meals, I have brought up a beautiful
daughter who is a credit to me.  I work, I have a stimulating and
wonderful hobby, I have loads of wonderful friends, I have a supportive
family who love me.  I am popular and a happy, healthy person who loves
life.

<p>
BUT................. I have found that alcohol for me is a problem, when I drink it
I find I cannot stop at a reasonable level but have to go on and on,
like you said until I make myself very ill, or even die, although
hopefully not yet.  I have tried many times to give up alcohol myself
and have succeeded for weeks and even months.  The longest I lasted was
5 years.  I just wonder if you have any magic ingredient in developing a
mind-set to get off the stuff completely.  I just feel I am missing out
when I abstain completely, yes I know its all an illusion and that the
bad times are not worth the good.  I know loads of people who have given
up totally on their on accord and live very happy, healthy lives thank
you very much.  I just think perhaps I even need hypnosis, this is the
only path I haven't tried.

<p>
Got any hints and tips.

<p>
Thanks<br>
Lily

<p>
PS I gave up smoking in 2006 so I'm not that weak!!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Lily,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I hope you are well.
<p>
Yes, I have some hints and techniques.
<p>
<ol>
<li> My favorite technique is being aware of what the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin32">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>
is doing.
Quitting is one thing; staying quit is something very different. And I found that it was almost
invariably the stupid Lizard Brain Addiction Monster that got me into trouble when I was tempted to have
a cigarette or a drink after I had quit. He would whisper things like,
<ul>
<li>
&quot;We've got it under control now. It's been so long since we've had one, with no
cheating whatsoever, so we've got it under control now.&quot;
<li>
&quot;We deserve to relax and have just one now. It will be okay.&quot;
<li>
&quot;Just one won't hurt.&quot;
<li>
&quot;I'm so stressed out right now, I just need a little hit of something
to get things on an even keel.&quot;
<li>
&quot;We are missing out on the good times when we completely abstain.&quot;
<li>
&quot;We are missing out on all of the good stuff in life, so let's join these other people and
have a good time.&quot;
<li>
&quot;Heck, you only live once, so let's live it with all of the gusto that we can.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
Then he will use brain-damaged logic like,
<ul>
<li> &quot;Look at all of those people drinking in moderation.  So we can do it too.&quot;
<li> &quot;Cigarettes aren't hurting those people. They are in perfect health.&quot;
<li> &quot;Time to return to normalcy and be like everybody else.&quot;
<li> &quot;Time to come home to the good times.&quot;
<li> &quot;Why say why?&quot;
<li> &quot;There's nothing wrong with a vacation once in a while.&quot;
<li> and on, and on...
</ul>

<p>
Above all, remember that the Lizard Brain's thoughts are not your thoughts.
He will try to fool you into believing that his thoughts are your thoughts, but they are not.
He is just a thirsty little toad who will do or say anything to get you to do what he wants.
But he is not you.  
<p>
For me, understanding that the little voice in my head that demands
a drink or a smoke IS NOT ME helps a lot. I can see that the
Addiction Monster has his own agenda, and he will do anything
and everything
he can to get me to smoke and drink, but he is not really me, and
his thoughts are not my thoughts.
<p>
That's really important:
<font color="#BF0000">
<b>His thoughts are not my thoughts.</b><br></font>
<p>
Also,
<font color="#BF0000">
His wishes are not necessarily my wishes.
</font>

<p>
So read that page on the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin32">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
 I find being aware of what is happening there to be a life-saver.

<p>
<li>
Then another thing that really helps is remembering the pain and the damage that was caused
by alcohol and tobacco.
I have a very basic gut-level revulsion to alcohol now, because parts of my body remember how
sick alcohol made me, and how much it messed me up. When I am tempted to drink,
remembering the pain and the damage quickly kills any desire to drink.

<p>
<li>
Then there is that great slogan,<br>
<center>
<h2>&quot;Just don't take that first drink, not ever, no matter what.&quot;</h2>
</center>
I live by that one. It's totally true that if you don't take the first drink, then you can't
drink too much, and you can't get into trouble with alcohol, and you can't get readdicted.

<p>
<li>
And then there is thinking about the future: Thinking about all of the negative and painful
things that would happen if I went back to drinking. That's good for quickly killing the desire
to drink, too. At a SMART meeting, a fellow named Kevin said that his favorite slogan was,<br>
<center>
<h2>&quot;Play the tape to the end.&quot;</h2>
</center>
That is, consider the whole thing like a movie on videotape.
It starts with the joy of drinking and partying, and ends with sickness,
misery, shame, poverty, and death.
Seeing the end that alcohol leads to also quickly kills the pleasant siren song of drink.
<p>
And, as we were just saying
<a href="orange-letters132.html#spite" target="newwin35">in a previous letter</a>,
we can even use negative emotions to our advantage, like spite and
resentment, as in,
<font color="green">
&quot;I can't possibly relapse now and give my back-biting
critics the satisfaction. No way will I let that happen.&quot;
</font>
That is also playing the tape to the end.

<p>
<a name="Cost_Benefit"> </a>
<li>  And then there is SMART. SMART helps with both the second and the fourth items.
SMART teaches a &quot;Risk/Reward Analysis&quot;, which is just a fancy way of saying that you
can examine any imagined course of action and
compare the benefits with the costs, and see which is greater. (Personally, I'm in the
habit of calling it a Cost/Benefit Analysis, which is the name that accountants use.)

I gave a few examples of such analyses in earlier letters,
<a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit" target="newwin36">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters15.html#cost_benefit2" target="newwin36">here</a> and

Sender:  	Craig J.<br>

<p>
Your website is intriguing, and you have put a lot of work into it.  You
obviously have much knowledge of many of the actual facts that most AA's
don't know (and that many of them don't want to know).

<p>
I could swear I once read something written by Bill Wilson, in which he
acknowledged that he was so depressed &#8212; for years after his last drink
 &#8212; that he had strongly contemplated suicide.  Are you familiar with
this writing?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Craig,
<p>
Thanks for an intriguing question. And I don't know the answer to it.
I know that for a long time, A.A. didn't even want to talk about Bill's
problem with depression.
It took A.A.W.S. more than 30 years to finally print a book that
admitted that Bill suffered from depression &#8212; <i>PASS IT ON</i>, 1984.
<p>
There is more about Bill's problem with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#depressive_disorder">deep clinical depression here</a>,
but I don't know of any tapes or books where he talked about it himself
or admitted that he was contemplating suicide. (He may well have, but I just don't know
where.)
<p>
In fact, when Bill Wilson and
Tom Powers co-wrote <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, around 1952, right in the middle
of Bill's 11-year-long depression, he wrote that the book 12X12 was a manual for how to live happy.
After 18 years of practicing Buchmanism, and &quot;working the Steps&quot;, Bill even declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But dependence upon an A.A. group or Higher Power hasn't produced
any baleful results.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 38.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Can you say, &quot;Denial isn't just a river in Egypt&quot;?
<p>
This is a good question for the A.A. historical trivia experts.

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange
<p>
In your opinion what is the best way to get sober. I agree with sick and
tired of being sick and tired.
<p>
But it is the mental aspect that very important. Is there any Buddhist ideas. If so
could you please send me the information. I have not drank 4 nearly 10 years.

<p>
Rodney Y.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rodney,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Those are two of the kind of questions that are at once one of the best that
I've ever received, and also the most difficult to answer.
<p>
First off, you are absolutely right that the mental aspect is very important.
It's extremely important. It's pretty much the whole ball game.
<p>
About quitting drinking, how to quit drinking, or rather, what techniques I find to
be helpful, I just answered the same question in a previous letter,
a few hours ago,
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin37">
here</a>, so I'll point you to that, because I already put my answers in there.

<p>
Now, about Buddhism:
<p>
Let me put in a disclaimer here and say straight out front that I am not qualified to teach
Buddhism. Oh, I've been reading about it and studying it, and trying a few practices for
more than 40 years, but I'm still not really qualified to teach it. But I do know a few
things, and I'll try to pass those jewels on.
<p>

For me, Buddhism is not a religion that you believe in &#8212; it's a sophisticated system of
psychology that you use and practice and live.
I don't &quot;believe in&quot; Buddha, <i>per se</i>. Oh, I believe that somebody by that name lived
around 600 BC, and that he taught a bunch of good things, and his followers made a religion out of it.
What matters is just the validity of the teachings, and whether they can help you,
and whether you actually practice and live the stuff.
<p>
The most important core thing to most of the Eastern religions' teachings is maintaining
awareness. Staying here and now. Staying awake in the here and now. That's what it's all about.
It is so simple, and yet so hard to do. Just stay awake. Just pay attention.
Just stay here and now.
<p>
The exercises, like meditation, are just practices
that help you to calm down and build up your ability to stay here and now.
The end goal is to develop continuous unbroken consciousness.

<p>
All of the other things, like the moral teachings like don't steal, don't rape, don't kill,
is actually part of the techniques to reduce your paranoia so that you can stay here and now.
When someone commits sins or crimes, it makes him fearful and paranoid, and that fear
drives his mind to want to run away and hide. It's almost impossible for a paranoid person
to stay centered in the here and now. The paranoia makes him put up mental barriers between
himself and other people, and he can't just be here with other people.
<p>
So much of what Buddha taught about the &quot;Eight-Fold Path&quot; and
&quot;right living&quot; was just a simple set of formulas for how to
arrange your life to have minimal paranoia and maximal tranquility and
peace of mind, so that you can stay aware and stay in the here and now.

<p>
I don't actually know of a good basic text for Buddhism &#8212; not one single book.
I've just been reading this and that and the other thing for so many years...
It sort of all adds up after a while.
<p>
What comes to mind is not actually labeled &quot;Buddhism&quot; <i>per se</i>
&#8212; it's sort of generic.
I'd recommend &quot;Be Here Now&quot; by Baba Ram Dass for starters, as a good general introduction.
It covers a lot of the same stuff. The basic truths are very universal.
<p>
Ram Dass himself explained that in his early training, back in the nineteen-sixties when he
first went to India,
he couldn't figure out what religion he was supposed to be while he wandered around India
with a tall blond ex-surfer kid from California who had become his teacher.
When they were in a Buddhist temple, it seemed
that they were Buddhists. Then, when they were in a Hindu temple, it seemed that they were
Hindus, and so on.
They seemed to be everything, because no matter where they went, the blond kid was recognized
at the temple and welcomed, and it turned out that he was one of them, too, and he had the
right little tillich or mark on his face for that group, and the other people had the attitude
of, &quot;Well this kid is so high and spiritual, of course he's one of us.&quot;
Eventually, Ram Dass learned that
they weren't very worried about which religion was which, and lots of people from various
religions hung out together and shared teachings.

<p>
I like that approach. It isn't the labels that are important, or membership in a certain church;
it's the teachings and the learning and the self-development.
<p>
As I look around, I see that I also have, laying around here, works in progress:
<ul>
<li> &quot;Miracle of Love; Stories about Neem Karoli Baba&quot;, also by Ram Dass
<li> &quot;Ethics for the New Millenium&quot;, by His Holiness the Dalai Lama

<li> &quot;How Can I Help; Stories and Reflections on Service&quot;, by Ram Dass and Paul Gorman

<li> &quot;Journey of Awakening; A Meditator's Guidebook&quot;, by Ram Dass

<li> &quot;The Art of Happiness; A Handbook for Living&quot;, by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler, M.D.
<li> &quot;An Open Heart; Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life&quot;, by The Dalai Lama

<li> &quot;Teachings of Zen&quot;, Translated by Thomas Cleary

<li> &quot;The Tibetan Book Of Living and Dying&quot;, by Sogyal Rinpoche

<li> &quot;Sayings of the Buddha; Reflections for Every Day&quot;, by William Wray

</ul>

<p>
Now that's just what I've got laying around here now, that I'm working on.
That choice was determined by what I found at used book stores
and Goodwill, not by any deliberate plan.
(So maybe it's my karma or something... :-)
But anyway, they seem like fine books, and they are giving me something to absorb.

<p>
And another great book that comes to mind, and one that I really recommend,
but may be very hard to find: It's the Sufi
equivalent of &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. And I can't even remember the name of it right now.
The author is probably Pir Villayat Khan. It also came out 30 or more years ago,
so you might stumble across a copy in a used book store.
For that book, the American Sufis
copied the same format as &quot;Be Here Now&quot;: it is a big square book printed on
recycled brown grocery bag paper just like &quot;Be Here Now&quot;,
and it is a lot like &quot;Be Here Now&quot; in content and approach, too, but it contains
a different selection of jewels, and says a bunch of good things. I like the Sufis, too.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

Orange &#8212;  Thanks for posting your reply to my note of July 7th, 2009.

<p>
I was struck by your sentence:
<p>
<center>
<font color="blue">
&quot;We have great inner resources that we
can draw upon to do great things, although we seldom do.&quot;.
</font>
</center>
<p>
I think this is really the heart of the matter.  Words and ideas have
meaning but oftentimes language can be a barrier to understanding.  I
would agree that a great inner resource exists and that this is what
solved my problem.  For me, I couldn't find it until I followed the
steps &#8212; then, there it was!
Your story and mine are remarkably similar in many ways.  It seems your
moment of defeat came with those doctor's words.  For me it came one
night on a bar stool sometime in June 1995 (I couldn't tell you the day)
when I too realized to the core of my being that I was going to die
drunk.   It was after this experience of defeat that the 12 steps made
sense to me and became rather straight-forward.  Unfortunately, it seems
that many alcoholics die of drinking before they reach that experience
of defeat.

<p>
I too am looking
<font color="blue"><b>&quot;to learn more about how to use those inner resources
and powers that we all have.&quot;.</b></font>

<p>
There surely are some amazing books on this topic!  I am running out of
bookshelf space!

<p>
Cordial regards,<br>

Hi Eric,
<p>
It's wonderful that you are working on self-development. I wish you good fortune.
<p>
The only problem I have there is with the assumption that the 12 Steps
somehow released your inner potential, and freed you from obsession,
and made you get sober, and even more. Even somehow connected you up
with God.
The big problem there is that when people believe that the 12 Steps have
done great things for them, they will then tell lots of other people to
do the 12 Steps, so that they too can get wonderful results.
And that wastes a lot of peoples' time and distracts them from doing something
else that actually helps.

<p>
Just very recently, after your letter, I received
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin39">a letter from a woman</a>
who has been in and out
of A.A. for 36 years now. And she says that A.A. does not work at all.
Can you imagine how many people have told her in those 36 years to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Work the Steps, Get a Sponsor, and Go to Meetings&quot;</font>,
convinced that they were handing out good advice?
<p>
You say that you became powerful and able to conquer your obsession with
alcohol by doing the 12 Steps.  And now you are working on developing
your inner resources.  The problem with that is that Step One teaches
that you are powerless over your problem, and can't help yourself:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.&quot;</i></b><br>
</font>
Step One is the extreme opposite of developing your inner powers.
I wrote a whole file on the problem of A.A. teaching &quot;powerlessness&quot;.
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="newwin41">Check it out here</a>.
<p>
Then Step Two declares that you are insane, and Step Three teaches that
you have to get Somebody Else to take care of you  &#8212; and worse,
<i>take care of your WILL for you</i>. And then Steps Four through Seven
teach that you are defective and full of moral shortcomings &#8212; so defective
that only God can fix you.
That is counter-productive. In fact, some people find that routine to be so
guilt-inducing and depressing that they commit suicide.


<p>
Bill Wilson was quite emphatic when he lectured that alcoholics were powerless over alcohol,
and alcohol &quot;had us licked&quot;.  Now, if you are reinterpreting Step One to mean
that you are powerful and in control of the situation, then the 12 Steps don't actually
mean anything.
That is, if you can arbitrarily completely reverse the meaning of any Step at will, and 
make it mean whatever you prefer it to mean, then the 12 Steps don't really
mean anything at all, and there is no Program.  There is just you believing whatever you wish
to believe.
<p>
(If it were really possible to just make up Steps at will, and make them mean
whatever you wish them to mean, and for them
to still have magical powers, then there wouldn't be any problem with alcoholism.
The alcoholics could just declare:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Step One: I admit that alcohol can't hurt me at all,
no matter how much of it I drink, and I have it under my complete control.&quot;
</font>
End of program.)
<p>
If you think that the Steps are empowering, why not reinterpret the Steps like this?
<ol>
<li> I admit that I am powerful over alcohol and can manage my life.
<li> I have come to believe that I am sane and don't need any Higher Power
to restore me to sanity.
<li> I decided to take care of myself and keep my will.
<li> My moral inventory tells me that I'm smart enough, and I'm good enough, and
darn it &#8212; people like me.
<li> And I said that to my sponsor.
<li> I'm always ready to get better.
<li> I fixed myself while Higher Power sat on his duff and watched...
<li> ... and so on...
</ol>

<p>
By the way, when the doctor told me, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
that was not a &quot;moment of defeat&quot;, as you called it.  You are trying to squeeze
other peoples' experiences into the Procrustean Bed of the 12 Steps.
I would call it a moment of clarity, and a moment
of realization, even a moment of acceptance of the facts, but certainly
not a moment of defeat. I wasn't defeated &#8212; in fact, I was so
empowered that I chose to quit drinking and live,
and I had the power to do it, and I did it, and I'm still doing it 8 years later.  
My experience is the exact opposite of Step One &#8212; I am not powerless over alcohol,
and I am not defeated by it. I won.
<p>
And I'm not insane, and I don't have any &quot;Higher Power&quot; taking
care of my will for me...

<p>
To assume that the 12 Steps made you suddenly powerful, and free of your obsession,
and able to conquer your drinking problem is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="newwin38">Confusion of Correlation
and Causation</a>
&#8212; assuming a cause-and-effect connection where there isn't any.
<p>
It's the same problem as this: Imagine that there was some guy named
&quot;Joe&quot;. Well Joe had cancer and his doctor told him that he
would die soon. Joe left the doctor's office pretty upset. But then a
friend talked about the wonderful curative powers of snake oil. Joe got
a bunch of Dr. Bummer's Magic Snake Oil Elixir, and drank a lot of it,
and rubbed it all over his body. And Joe's cancer went into remission,
and he recovered, and Joe is sure that the snake oil is what did it,
so now he tells every cancer patient around to avoid the stupid doctors,
and just use Dr. Bummer's Magic Snake Oil Elixir to treat their cancer.

<p>
Now Joe is totally convinced that the snake oil really worked, and really healed him.
And we will probably have no success in convincing Joe otherwise.
But how can we determine if snake oil really cures cancer?

<p>
Simple. We do some tests. We could call them &quot;scientific&quot;
tests, but let's not, because so many people are confused about what
the word &quot;science&quot; actually means. Let's just say that
we are going to do some simple, down-to-earth, common-sense tests.
<p>
<ol>
<li> First off, let's see if snake oil is poisonous. We give a bunch of
it to some rats and mice to drink, and also rub it on them.  Fortunately
for them, it isn't poisonous. None of them got sick and died. So far so good.
<p>
<li> Then we get a bunch of people who have cancer. We randomly pick names
out of a hat, and give half of the patients the snake oil.  We give no
snake oil to the other half. Then we see what happens.
<p>
<li> Well, you and I both know what happened, because that test was done
long ago: The people who got the snake oil didn't fare any better than
the other &quot;untreated&quot; patients.  That experiment was done back
in the eighteen-hundreds, and the cancer patients all died.  The snake
oil didn't heal them. No improvement at all. Zilch. Zip. Nada.
<p>
<li> Conclusion: Snake oil doesn't really cure cancer.
</ol>
<p>
So why did Joe recover from cancer? Who knows? There were a lot of other things going on
in Joe's life at the same time. Maybe he quit smoking and drinking and changed his diet,
and that improved his health enough for his immune system to be able to defeat the cancer.
Maybe he stopped being a couch potato who lived on beer and chips and pretzels, and
went outside and got some sunshine and exercise, having decided to live to the fullest
in the little time he had left.
Maybe he was just lucky, and the cancer went into spontaneous remission for reasons still unknown.
With single anecdotal cases like that, it's very hard to say what happened.

<p>
Now what about testing A.A. the same way? Well, that test has been done too,
several times, and the alcoholics getting A.A. didn't fare any better than the cancer
patients getting snake oil.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin42">Dr. Brandsma found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin43">Dr. Ditman found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin44">Dr. Walsh found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive</a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="newwin45">Doctors Orford and Edwards found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour</a> was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.

<p>
<li> And the most damning evidence of all came from 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="newwin46">Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who is Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, and
who for many years was a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous [World]
Services, Inc., as well as being an enthusiastic promoter of A.A.-based treatment.
He found that Alcoholics Anonymous was completely ineffective for getting alcoholics
to quit drinking, and the biggest effect of A.A. was to raise the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ol>

<p>
So the results are in: The Twelve Steps do not cure or improve alcoholism.
<p>
(Oh, actually, it seems like nobody did the very first test before the others:
Nobody tested Alcoholics Anonymous to see if it was poisonous, before
&quot;the A.A. Pioneers&quot; foisted it
on millions of sick people. That is downright inconsiderate, to put it mildly.)

<p>
So was it just a coincidence that you quit drinking while doing the
Twelve Steps?  Of course not. You were actively working on quitting
drinking, and solving your problem, and you finally succeeded.
The fact that you were also wasting your time on some old cult religion
practices that some misinformed people told you to do just showed that
you were willing to try almost anything in order to solve your problem.

<p>
Keep up the work on the self-improvement. Just don't believe it when they tell you that you
are powerless and <i>in denial</i>, and need to confess everything in a <i>Fifth Step</i>...
<p>
And have a good day.
