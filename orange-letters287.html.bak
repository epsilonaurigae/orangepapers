Subject:  	Leave My Sponsee Alone<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
I want you to leave my sponsee alone and stop talking to him on your abomination of
a website. I read his emails he sent to you and what you sent back and also what you
said to someone else about him. Did you know he has a serious spiritual disorder and
also one inside his head? He doesn't know any better than to write a fool like you.
He's just a retard kid who is still very childish. He even thought I wouldn't know
he wrote you if he used a fake name but I saw write through it. I read your letters
all the time to warn people about how you will lead them into sin and back to the
bottle. That kid is so lucky we got him in AA. His dad gave him a bottle of liquor
and he brought it to school, or else he never would have got here. You can't lead
him away from what is good for him. I also think it's depictable that you made fun
of the creation museum where I took him. That kid needs a good guidance and God is
the only way to go. You need to do all your steps
before you tell people such horrible things and get my sponsee not to talk to me.
Good thing it's easy to convince him to talk to me again after some convincing. You
are exploiting a poor retard and sick in the head kid. You should be ashamed of
yourself. Start doing all the steps, especially 4, 5, 9, and 10. AA is the only
thing that's going to bring this world back to Jesus, and that's the truth. I hope
you get saved and get back in AA.

Hello Mrs. Phyllis F.,
<p>
You did not bother to say who your sponsee is. I see that your letter came from the email address
of someone who calls himself &quot;Hagar the Horrible&quot;. I can only assume that you must have hijacked
his computer and used his computer and email address to send your letter. 
<p>
You really have contempt for your sponsee, don't you? You say that your unfortunate sponsee is
retarded and
suffering from &quot;a serious spiritual disorder and also one inside his head&quot;?
And how did you determine that? Are you a doctor? 
Are you a psychiatrist? Are you a priest?
What qualifies you to treat &quot;spiritual diseases&quot;?
<p>
You say that the young fellow was given a bottle of alcohol by his father. That does not make
him an alcoholic. What is he doing in A.A.?
<p>
Obviously, it is you who is &quot;exploiting a poor retard and sick in the head kid.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day.

Yeah, no kidding. My netbook was actually still in warranty when it
died, but Asus claimed that smoking and melting its own charger was,
somehow, not covered under their warranty. I'm pretty sure said netbook
died of the same thing that caused AM problems: a short in the power
supply. And I never did anything particularly unusual with any of my
systems, unless installing Linux counts as unusual. Which it definitely
isn't, especially for the netbook. (Windows 7 Starter is easily one of

Windows 7 Home Premium.)

Indeed. I hope against all hope that I never, ever end up with a
&quot;therapist&quot; like that. Hopefully, there's not a &quot;Psychotic Depression
Anonymous&quot;, but there probably is. Any good Stepper would find a way to
blame it all on alcohol regardless, I suppose, despite the fact I've
never had more than a few sips of booze in my entire life. And it would
not be wise for me to start now, since I doubt alcohol would play nicely
with my meds.

About the sex thing: I was just repeating the lecture that I got from
my biology professor: &quot;Possession of the XX or XY chromosome pair is
the primary sexual characteristic. All of the other things that guys
admire, like breasts, are just secondary sexual characteristics.&quot;
<p>
Of course there are some individuals with XXY chromosomes and other
odd combinations, but they are very very rare. I remember the case of
one XXY who made it into the Olympics, as a woman, and they had a big
debate about whether she was a man or a woman. I seem to recall that
they disqualified her because possession of the Y chromosome gave her
manly musculature, and they considered that an unfair advantage in
competing against other women.
<p>
I don't think that was the case with the girl who when autopsied by an
incompetent coroner, was found to have a normal penis and testes. I
think that the explanation was that the coroner either mixed up his
papers, or examined the wrong cadaver, or didn't even actually examine
any body, and just made up the whole thing.

<br>
</font>

<p>
Yeah, that is an accurate description of sex, but there's a lot of
things that determine gender. There's evidence that transgendered
individuals have the brain structure of the gender they identify as:<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222156/http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/sex/TRANSGENDER.pdf" target="_blank">
http://faculty.bennington.edu/~sherman/sex/TRANSGENDER.pdf</a>



<p>

And while the unusual combinations are rare, there's enough people in
the world that &quot;very rare&quot; still means thousands of people. I remember
that Castor Semenya mess. I would argue it's more unusual for her to be
athletic enough to qualify for the World Championships than it is for
her to be XXY. There really needs to be a Trans- or Inter- Olympics.

<p>
No disagreement about the incompetent coroner, though. It's a wonder he
graduated high school, since basic anatomy does get taught in middle
school where I live.

<p>
As for the mudblup thing, all I managed to find was the reference to
Teddy Ruxpin, so thanks for that explanation. They sound vaguely
zombie-like.

<p>
Anyhow, I'm off to not attending a creation museum and trying to enjoy
life as a temporary college drop-out. (I had to be put on additional
meds, due to the &quot;psychotic&quot; aspect of my depression showing its ugly
mug. That, and the &quot;depression&quot; part, too. Those textbooks were
certainly an even bigger waste of money than usual.) Hopefully, I can at
least get an entry-level job. If not, escapism time until Fall 2012.

Hello again, Danteris,
<p>
It isn't a matter of &quot;just somebody's opinion&quot;. Careful medical tests have shown that A.A.
is a failure, and any of the alternative ways of treating alcohol abuse
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">produce a lower death rate</a>.
<p>
If you want something that is really just somebody's opinion, try
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's crazy opinion
that Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion would cure alcoholism</a>. Now that is sheer insanity.
There is a very good reason why Bill Wilson was under the care of two psychiatrists  &#8212;  Dr. Harry Tiebout
and Dr. Francis Weeks.

<p>
By the way, the claim that it's all &quot;just somebody's opinion&quot; is the propaganda trick
called &quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a>&quot;.
It's a lame attempt to dismiss information that you don't like by claiming that it's all just a matter of
opinion, one opinion versus another opinion, and nothing is certain...  Yes, some things are certain,
like that A.A. is ineffective and just raises the death rate in alcoholics.

<p>
As a matter of fact, I receive a Veteran's Administration disability pension. Can you explain to me
what that has to do with Alcoholics Anonymous or drug and alcohol rehabilitation?
Does being a disabled veteran make someone less qualified to criticize A.A., or talk about recovery?

<p>
That is an example of the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>Ad Hominem</i>, Launch Personal Attacks On Opponents</a>&quot;
&#8212;  don't talk about the issues, or debate the facts, just attack the speaker.

You have a good day too.

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
Thanks for your reply. It at least shows me you are passionate. I find that
comforting. I thank you for the essays. I really didn't understand what AA was
about, but thanks to you and your experiences I think I do. This leads me to the
crux of my initial contact. What does work for the apparently out of control
drinker? I had a good friend die,  another one is on the way, and I'm deeply
concerned. AA is  a very institutionalized organization now and is shoved down
people's throats as you noted. I just thought that attitude was formed by those not
wanting to try AA or resisting treatment altogether.  Now I can see where they are
coming from. What has been and is a successful road to recommend? I don't want to
lose another friend to drugs and alcohol. I know the outcome of his life is his
doing, but I'd sure hate to offer advice that may be harmful.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Mark

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the comments.

<p>
Yes, the accusation that &quot;you just don't want to get sober, and that's why you criticize A.A.&quot;
is a common one. When I talk about the
A.A. failure rate, they respond by claiming that &quot;You just couldn't get sober in A.A.&quot;, or &quot;You just
don't want to get honest and work the Steps&quot;.
Even when I had 10 years clean and sober, they were still saying the same things, like here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters255.html#James_O" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters255.html#James_O</a>

<p>
By the way, I have 11 years clean and sober now,
and I actually quit drinking two weeks before I was sent to A.A. by a so-called &quot;treatment program&quot;.
That is where I was shocked to learn that cult religion is the standard American treatment for
drug and alcohol problems.
And that's when I began collecting evidence against such insane treatment, and writing and speaking out.

<p>
About your friends &#8212; I'm sorry to hear about the death of a friend. I've lost many, too, especially
since I began associating with what they euphemistically call &quot;the recovery community&quot;.

<p>
Statistically, it's a coin toss whether somebody will quit his bad habits and recover, or never quit.
Approximately 50% of all alcoholics eventually quit drinking, and the other half don't.
And the situation with drug addicts is about the same.
Many of the non-quitters die premature deaths from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.
<p>
On the bright side, most of the 50% who do quit do it alone, without any &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;program&quot;.
They just get sick and tired of being so sick and tired (like I did), and just quit.

<p>
Now the good news: Yes, there are several good things that can help. I wrote it all down before, so
I'll point you to the lists of letters and discussions and pages:<br>
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

Have a good day now, and good luck with your friends.

Hello again, Jordan,
<p>
Yes, I have several items of information about Wilson's LSD use.
<p>
But note that Bill Wilson did not quit A.A. to take LSD. He took the LSD while he was still in A.A., and
that became a problem for the trustees, because Bill Wilson was using his office
at the A.A. headquarters and official
A.A. stationery to promote LSD use, so they asked him to knock it off. It was years later when
Bill Wilson resigned from A.A.

LCCN: 84-072766<br>

'PASS IT ON' contains a whole chapter describing Bill Wilson's use of LSD.
Bill Wilson's first trip was August 29, 1956, in Los Angeles. See <i>PASS IT ON</i>, pages 368 to 377.

Susan Cheever, who was allowed to read the secret locked and sealed A.A. historical archives, talked about

Aldous Huxley talked about Bill Wilson experimenting with exotic drugs
in &quot;Letters of Aldous Huxley&quot;  edited by Grover Smith  &#8212;  adrenochrome at that time.
Adrenochrome is an epinephrine derivative with hallucinogenic properties.
This paragraph is in a letter that Huxley wrote to
Dr. Humphry Osmond.  Osmond, you will recall, was the researcher who
supplied Wilson with LSD.  The date was September 16, 1960.

<p>
<blockquote>

&quot;Yesterday I lunched with Bill Wilson who spoke enthusiastically of his

<p>
And there are more. At other times, it was the Irish, or the Polish, or the Catholics, or the Arabs, or...

Subject:  	Acceptance was the answer.<br>

<p>
Hi

<p>
Thanks for the time and effort you put into the papers. I have read you for a few
years and am amazed by the amount of research you have carried out.
<p>
I am in my 18th year of sobriety (no alcohol) and 8th year cigarette free. In my
first 12 years of sobriety I must have attended about 3 thousand meetings, in the
next 4 years some few dozen meetings and about 6 in the last two years. I am not
planning to go to a meeting today.

<p>
If your ONLY complaint against A.A. was that a message is given to some members by
some other members not to take medication prescribed by qualified medical personal
(tradition 10 &#8212; long form), that should surely be enough  for the relevant
authorities to investigate when the inevitable deaths occur. If this was the only
matter that you concerned yourself with it would be enough for you to be commended
by any right thinking person.

<p>
What are your views on members being led to believe that they are victims and
powerless at every turn. At many meetings the constant whine of &quot; I am powerless
over people places and things &quot; is ever present and repeated and repeated and
repeated......

<p>
The reading or saying that was guaranteed to irritate me the most is from one of the
stories at the back of the Bigbook. 3rd edition &#8212; &quot;Doctor Addict Alcoholic&quot;. Renamed as
&quot;Acceptance Was The Answer&quot; in the 4th edition. Apparantly every person, place, thing or
situation is exactly as it is meant to be as nothing, absolutely nothing happens in
God's world by mistake. If I cannot accept  that
war, violence, rape, racism, antisemintism, religious hatred, bankers greed, etc. etc. is
part of some master plan, I am told that it is my fault. (And I may drink)

<p>
For many years I gave A.A. the credit for sobering me up when in effect I was 2
months sober before I attended A.A.
<p>
Obviously I went to so many meetings for so long because I was getting something out
of it. I believe the most important thing I received was the one thing I always
insisted was not that important  &#8212;  the fellowship of other people.

<p>
Thanks again<br>
Hugh

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Hugh,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments, and I have to agree on all of your points.
And congratulations for being alcohol- and tobacco-free for so many years. It really feels good
to be healthy, doesn't it?

<p>
That crazy dogma about helplessness and powerlessness is really harmful, isn't it?
If I really believed that I was powerless over alcohol, how could I have ever quit drinking and stayed sober?
<p>
Unfortunately, some confused people really buy into those teachings that they are powerless,
and come to believe that they are powerless, and then they end up powerless. Funny how that works.

<p>
And yes, I was also two weeks sober before I went to A.A.
Quitting was a bitch because it took me a long time to build up the drive and the determination to
quit and stay quit, but I wasn't powerless.

<p>
I agree that having a sober social circle can be a big help. That's one of the reasons that I am
happy to see more and more of the other sobriety meetings getting established  &#8212;  like SMART, SOS, Lifering,
WFS, and HAMS. (The whole list is
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)
Having a group of people who are very understanding and supportive, and who won't teach a bunch
of insane misinformation about alcohol and addiction, can be a real help to newly-sober people.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Thanks for the comment. And I have to agree. That letter just 
displays so many characteristics of the worst of sponsorship relationships:

<p>
<ol>
<li> The sponsor is a know-it-all and the sponsee is allegedly a &quot;retard&quot;.
<li> The newcomer supposedly has a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
<li> The sponsor claims to be qualified to diagnose and treat &quot;spiritual diseases&quot; and also other mental disorders.
<li> She imagines that A.A. has all of the answers and nobody else knows anything.
<li> She claims that only A.A. is entitled to speak to the sponsee, and the sponsee cannot talk to outsiders.
<li> The &quot;spiritual, not-religious&quot; A.A. program is supposedly going to lead the
kid back to Jesus, which is &quot;the only way&quot;.
<li> She claims that only wonderful A.A. will lead the people back to God and Jesus.
<li> She says that someone who disagrees with A.A. is a sinner who is trying to lead others to sin.
<li> A kid who got caught drinking alcohol once is supposedly an alcoholic who has to spend the rest of his life in A.A.
<li> She says that the kid was lucky to get shanghaied into A.A.
<li> The sponsor obviously &quot;has a resentment&quot;.
<li> The sponsor is a domineering bully.

Subject:  	Re: Holy Motherfucking Shit<br>

<p>
Even if Hagar actually is a &quot;retard&quot; (which I doubt), I've met people
with developmental disabilities before. I shared a special education
program in high school with people with developmental disabilities
(before then, I attended a richer school district which separated their
special ed program by disability type). They were pretty much normal
teenagers in many ways. They certainly had their own opinions. They
possessed basic reasoning abilities. Nobody needed to think for them.
They needed support, not some domineering sponsor who denies them the
slightest bit of privacy or any form of contact in the outside world.
(In fact, those kids often did volunteering stuff and held jobs with the
aid of the special ed teachers.)

<p>
Yeah, bringing booze to school is pretty much more &quot;normal teenager did
something dumb&quot; than &quot;alcoholic&quot;. There's no shortage of well-adjusted
kids at my high school who got either kicked out or booted to the
alternative school program for bringing drugs. At one point, the
alternative school program was full, and I bet the majority of attendees
fell in that category. Zero tolerance is fun. Incidentally, said high
school is in the middle of the Bible Belt.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Meatbag,
<p>
Yes, the whole situation is way overblown and wrong. Apparently, the kid got sentenced to A.A. meetings
by the judge for bringing alcohol to school, and then this crazy manipulative woman decided that she was going
to collect him as her slave and remake him in her image.
And I notice that the judge is responsible for handing a defenseless kid to a fundamentalist cult religion
for indoctrination and conversion, which is blatantly illegal and unConstitutional.

Hi,

<p>
I love your site. Thanks for all your hard work and dedication. I'll be
reading it for some time to come. It should certainly help me keep an upbeat
attitude as I persevere in my court ordered AA/NA meetings. It's been a long
time since I've been to one. I didn't like them then, and I don't like them
now. I've been to one AA and one NA in the last week. AA has not changed one
bit. NA has seemed to change just a little and given a choice I would do NA
over AA. Maybe it's their more rebellious nature that I prefer. As for the
12 steps &#8212; Fuck the 12 steps. The only point to AA I can even imagine is,
initial crisis and subsequent reality check. Once you've got your bearings
and orientation, get the hell out as fast as you can before you're
assimilated and lose your sanity.

Hello Terry,

Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
Did you know that it is now illegal to force people into A.A. or N.A.? They have to give you other choices,
like SMART, or you can sue them.
Yes, you can actually sue a judge or parole officer or probation officer for not giving you a choice.
They cannot legally force a cult religion routine on you.
Look here:
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#Inouye" target="_blank">the Inouye v. Kemna case</a>.

Now I know that law gets broken every day. Plenty of law enforcement people
ignore the law and do whatever they wish to do.
And you can sue them for it later.

Hi Orange,

<p>
Thanks, I know about the cases and all. For now, I don't have the energy to
make a Federal Case out of it, nor do I want to attract attention to myself
in my small city (I got my DUI out of state and would have to sue my local
treatment counselor as well as the judge). I suggested SMART to my lawyer,
but he said, no way would any judge go for online meetings as they could be
faked. Yea whatever, how naive. Don't they realize the paper signed at a
meeting is easier to fake than an electronic document? Well, I could fake an
electronic document, but it's more of a hassle.

<p>
The 12 steps are a complete waste of time. I've quit a number of things at
various junctures in my life, tobacco, demerol/morphine, meth... You know
what? I did it myself, no steps, no treatment. Just the realization that I
can do this! There is no higher power other than to just do it!

Hello again, Captain Britain,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you and
<a href="orange-letters168.html#NRL" target="newwin939">the NRL</a> are doing well.
<p>
England would be fun. I've only been in England one time in my life, in 1962,
for only two hours, and I wasn't allowed out of Heathrow Airport. 
We were just transferring from one airplane to another.
My big experience of England was hearing a woman with a beautiful English accent
making announcements on the public address speakers.
<p>
We were traveling to Germany, where we would spend the next three years (which I loved).
My father was in the Air Force, and I was a teenager at the time,
and we were transferred to Germany.
<p>
 Unfortunately, they
insist that the travel be so efficient. I mean, there we were, in England, and could not
even dawdle and goof around and see the place for a week before getting on another airplane
and continuing on to Germany. Just two lousy hours in the airport.
What a waste of travel money. I mean, if you are going to pay for an airplane ticket to go someplace on
the other side of the world, at least see the place.
Geez.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Just making sure you had this particular tidbit. I read this last year, but don't
think I did more than mention it at ST. You know more about Aspen Education than I
do, I'm sure. Its parent company is owned by Bain Capital, founded in 1997 when Mitt
was still at the helm. I can't find on Wikipedia where I originally saw it, but it's
there. Also here:

Just something I figured I would mention, not that that will derail Romney any worse
than his claims of being an unemployed guy who isn't concerned about the poor, but
it's still there.

Hello Lex,
<p>
Thanks for the input. I knew about some of that stuff, like
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Straight" target="_blank">the history of Straight</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Sembler2" target="_blank">political connections</a>
between funding of the teen abuse industry and some Republican donors,
but this is even more detailed.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi

What is your background if you don't mind... it does not require a discourse... just one
sentence or too. I will say more

Hello Stephen,
<p>
Thanks for the comments and the question. I can easily give you a lot more than one sentence,
because I've been asked that question many times before, and already wrote down all of the answers.

Subject:  	AA staff compensation<br>

<p>
Greetings  &#8212; 

<p>
I was doing some research on trying to find out the compensation of
staff at AA GSO in New York, and ran across your email address.  Sounds
like you're a good watchdog on this matter.

<p>
In any event, I have emailed an inquiry to the main AA office but don't
expect an answer anytime soon, if at all.  Is it possible for you to
provide me with how much the &quot;Very Rev.&quot; Ward Ewing makes?  as well as
other top staff?

<p>
Thank you.

Hello Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question. It will be interesting to see what kind of a response
you get to your question. Please let me know if you get anything.
<p>
I don't think I have any current information on
the new leader of A.A., Rev. Ward Ewing, but I know about the previous leader,
Greg Muth.
He was getting a total of $250,000 per year. He was getting $125,000 per year for being the General
Manager of AAWS and also $125,000 for being the leader of the GSO. Not a bad job, $125,000 per year for
working four hours a day (twice).
And his lawyer friend Thomas Jasper got $469,850 for a going-away present (which
some observers complain has never been adequately explained).
<p>
This link will lead you to a whole bunch of information on A.A. finances, including
copies of their Form 990 filings with the IRS. Those documents require them to list the salaries of the
leaders.

<p>
You have reminded me that it is time to go looking for Form 990s for 2009 and 2010, so I shall go looking.
There are a couple of good places to find them, including Guidestar, which is a rating service for non-profits
and charities.

<p>
Have a good day now.
