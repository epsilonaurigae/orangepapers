Hey, just in case you need more evidence to back up how AA is ineffective (which is
beginning to seem to me to be a lot like creationism versus evolution), the Cochrane
Collaboration published a study this year showing that, yes, it is indeed
ineffective. link:

The judges would not have to sentence anyone to AA if the rocket scientist

Well, Psychodr, your &quot;no-brainer&quot; is completely missing the point.
 Judges are empowered to sentence drunk drivers
to all kinds of punishments that range from drivers' education classes to
 counseling sessions to years in prison.
But judges do not have the legal power to sentence anybody to the meetings of a cult religion, or
any other kind of religion, either.
<p>
That is illegal, unConstitutional, and immoral.
<p>
And that is what is wrong with sentencing drunk drivers to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

Subject:  	Re: The Orange papers<br>

<p>

Greetings and thanks for the response.  I expect that you keep yourself
pretty busy so with this and other ventures so I don't begrudge you
taking a little while to respond.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Ted,
<p>
Well, it took a while, but here we are.
</font>
<p>

A personal point of privilege concerning
<a href="orange-letters75.html#TedK2f">my comment about Orange and AA finances</a>.
OK, you caught me.  I made a snappy reaction and it was out
of place.  email is an imperfect mode of communication as are all
others.  Given the chance to get to know you a little better before I
sent it I hope I would have reacted more gently.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay.
</font>
<p>

On to the issue of AA suing people in Germany and Central or South
America over distribution or ownership rights.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

OK, fine.  I have read most of what is on your pages about these issues
and I have some  comments:  First, I am bothered by these reports as I
have heard similar from other sources.  I believe it was reported on
your site (or a similar one...it has been quite a while since I read the
story.) that many board members and people in positions of authority (I
don't like that too much either.) quit voluntarily over this (and I
don't hear any credit given for doing so), and perhaps, according to the
laws applying, some people belong in prison.  But where did these
actions come from?  I believe it is not from the program but from those
involved.  Who first reported this?  Wasn't it other members of AA?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I learned about it from
<a href="orange-not_good.html#MitchellK_list">Mitchell K.</a>, who reported it on About.Com, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">Anthony of the U.K.</a>
<p>
You do realize, of course, that you are using
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">Minimalization and Denial</a> there?
As if the crimes of the A.A. leadership are less serious because some of the
membership objected to them?
<p>
The membership sure should have objected, considering that the crimes
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. leaders and staff were being committed against
the A.A. membership. And note that none of the leaders got fired for it. The A.A.W.S.
leadership is totally out of control. They are accountable to no one.
And that's another big problem with Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Bill Wilson was an idiot when it came to designing organizations.
<br>
So-called &quot;Tradition Nine&quot;:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but
we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to
those they serve.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Yeh, right.
</font>
<p>

Second, there never has been an organization, since the beginning of man
as we know it, that has not been associated at one time or another with
trouble-makers or generally bad people who just don't see the point
behind it all.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And I do realize that is more <a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">Minimalization and Denial</a>.
</font>
<p>

If you have made changes in your personality that are necessary to
control any undesirable habit, no matter what it is, you will find
yourself in the presence of people that have not &quot;grown&quot; in the way you
might have.  While in a perfect world the best thing might be to simply
share your wisdom with them and be happy that they grow along with you.
In the world we live in it is rarely the case of that being either the
best thing for you (I'm sure you've caught on that I am using the word
generically.) or them.  Often I have found that the best way is NOT to
cast your pearls before swine, so to speak.  We almost never learn from
the experience of others.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sadly, that is often true.
</font>
<p>

Unfortunately two of the most common characteristics of leaders are
ambition and charisma.  IMO, Jesus, Gandhi, Mother Theresa, whose
opinions we argue over after years, decades and millennia, didn't spend
a lot of time seeking those things, yet most of our leaders have and do.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Also true. Although, these days, I would even question the use of the word &quot;leaders&quot;.
George W. Bush and the other politicians are not leading us anywhere.
There is no leadership.
</font>
<p>

That said, and even keeping in mind the fact that one of the &quot;founders&quot;
of AA wanted to &quot;sell&quot; the program at one time, I would find it amazing
if the history of AA had less blemishes than it does.  (Judas Iscariot
was a big time dude in the ministry.  He even controlled the money!)  To
me the difference is when bad things are done &quot;are those things part of
the nature of the organization&quot; or &quot;are they exceptions?&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is more <a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">Minimalization and Denial</a>.
The evidence is accumulating that the problems with A.A. are inherently the nature of the organization:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors">The 13th-Stepping</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group">the rapes of under-age girls</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor">the people yanked away from their families</a>,
<li>
the people who become obsessed with Alcoholics Anonymous,
<li>
the people who become mindless slogan slingers and dogma parrots,
<li>
the people who become angry warriors for the cult,
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#milk_whiskey">the immense amount of
misinformation about alcoholism and recovery</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-heresy.html">the crazy theology</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_dishonesty">the deceit and dishonesty and falsification of history</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">
the insanity of the Founder Bill Wilson and his <i>Big Book</i></a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-letters81.html#JustMe">the harm done to a lot of people</a>...
</ul>
&#8212; it seems like a poor cure for alcoholism.
<p>
And remember that Alcoholics Anonymous has no system for supervising sponsors and firing bad ones.
There is no accountability.
The sexual predators and the self-appointed cult leaders can do whatever they wish, indefinitely.
<p>
And Bill Wilson's lies in the sacred &quot;first 164 pages&quot; of the <i>Big Book</i> will never be
corrected, either.

</font>
<p>

We can make up our own minds.

<p>
<font color="blue">
We had better.
</font>
<p>

Let me describe my thoughts on it this way, I am a Republican, but in no
way approve of everything that happens in the party nor every party
plank.  I think an honest Democrat would say the same about their party.

<p>
<font color="blue">
True.
</font>
<p>

With that in mind, I remain an honest member of AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay.
</font>
<p>

Now, concerning cults.  Since you have chosen your definition of cults
and ignored mine I feel no reason to investigate yours.  I'm talking to
you, not these guys.  Who are they?  What impact do they have on your
beliefs concerning cults?  What implications do you see from your
resultant characterizations of groups as cults?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Definition of cult? Excuse me, but you did not provide any definition of &quot;cult&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters75.html#TedK2c">You merely remarked</a>
that you had read some &quot;religious apologetics&quot;,
and then you listed only one single characteristic of a cult:
<font color="#4f007f">
'The singular characteristic of a cult is that the follower &quot;must&quot; be
removed from their family.'
</font>

<p>
That is not a definition of a cult, nor is it a description of the most important characteristic
of a cult.
<p>
If a cult is just something that removes someone from their family, then the U.S. Army, a Christian
seminary, a child welfare foster home, and a residential college all qualify as cults.
There is a lot more to a cult than that.
<p>
Well I have done a lot of reading too. A LOT of reading. Look at
<a href="orange-bibliography.html">the bibliography</a>.
And it was from reading all of those books about cults, as well as personal experiences
with cults in the 'sixties and 'seventies that I assembled
<a href="orange-cult.html">the Cult Test</a>,
a list of 100 common cult characteristics.
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_total_immersion">Social isolation and total immersion in the cult</a>
is just one of the hundred.

<p>
Now if you want to try providing an actual definition of a cult, then we can discuss your definition.
You could start with the dictionary definition of a cult, you know.
<a href="orange-definitions.html#cult">Look here</a>.

<p>
I don't know what &quot;these guys&quot; you are referring to when you say,
&quot;I'm talking to you, not these guys.&quot;
</font>
<p>

What I have found in my studies (over perhaps 20 years) is that folks
who exhibit a generally anti- or at least a complainatory view of
Christianity or quasi-Christian groups select those definitions and
definers that they agree with.  Fair enough, I may do the same.  One
difference is the answer to this question: &quot;Does the definition of
`cult' that you chose to use leave any room for any evangelical
religious group to be excluded?&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

(Feel free to ask my why I asked the question in that manner if you like.)

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

If not, then your definition leaves me thirsty.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Huh? You aren't making much sense there. There is room for evangelical religious groups to not be
cults, if they don't insist that the leader is always right, and the followers always wrong,
and redefine the language, and practice guilt induction, and promote irrational dogma, etc.
Just go down the list of 100 cult characteristics. You <i>did actually read</i>
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html">the list that you are rejecting</a>,
didn't you? Or did you?
</font>
<p>

Now finally, concerning groups that require followers to leave family
and friends.  I'm not sure if you mean this in general or specific with
regard to alcohol, so I'll try to address both.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Groups such as the Bhagwani's, saffron-robe wearers or kool-aid drinkers
demand that you basically sever all ties with your past life.  This is
not, AFAIK, a requirement of AA nor do I support it.  If some groups do
it then they made the crap up and all it does is give us a bad name and
screw up a bunch of people's lives.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, but it still happens. And the damage is still done.
</font>
<p>

If, on the other hand, you are referring to suggestions that someone
with an alcohol problem might want to choose new friends that don't
spend all their time partying, well I think that is up to each
individual and their program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But when someone becomes obsessed with A.A. and only associates with other A.A. members,
then that creates a problem.

</font>
<p>

It's my program dammit (I would say to them), and if it works for me
don't give me a hard time about it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>Now we come to the truth.</b><br>
Everything before that sentence was just an apology for your position.
You like A.A., period, facts be damned.

</font>
<p>



Some people find that they cannot
go to a bar, grocery or convenience store that they used to buy from
without being tempted.  I personally do not have that problem.  If I had
a sponsor or a group that told me how to deal with these situations in a
way that does not follow my plan then guess what?  I'm looking for a new
sponsor or group.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Follow what plan?
</font>
<p>

There are always going to be weak people that are taken advantage of by
the strong.  I could make a pretty fair argument that your group is
doing that.
<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;My group&quot;? There is no &quot;my group&quot;.
</font>
<p>


I can see that someone who might be weak in some way or
another might read some of your web pages and not have the fortitude to
actually make a value judgment about what you say before quitting AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh geez Louise. Get real. Talk about
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial">a reversal of reality</a>.
You have people being sentenced
to A.A. meetings every day, and you are worried about some &quot;weak&quot; person being lured away
from Alcoholics Anonymous? What about the weak people who get sucked into A.A. from having
been forced to go to A.A. meetings?
</font>
<p>

A possible danger I see in your group, and you probably do not intend
for it to be used in this way, but there are non-alcoholic spouses who
divorce and take information very similar to what is presented in your
pages to manipulate decisions of the courts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, I don't have a group. I am the sole author of one set of web pages.
<p>
If spouses use some accurate and true information to make arguments in courts, then good.
What's wrong with that?
</font>
<p>

Here is my problem.  On the one hand I've got you: some anonymous guy on
the web were anyone can make any claim they want and find evidence that
life is really just as depicted in the Matrix movies, and then I have a
person that I might know, sitting in a meeting with me crying because
her husband found a judge that is willing to restrict unsupervised
visitation based on this stuff you post.  (This really happens!)

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

My choices are two.  I can tell that poor woman, that I have known to be
a recovering alcoholic doing the best she can like the rest of us, that
she is going to have to accept seeing her kids for one week a year
during the holiday of his chosing...or I can try to figure out what you
are about and share what useful information I can.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are attempting a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote">Proof by Anecdote</a>.
You haven't told us anything like the truth of the matter.
You are trying to just give us a sob story.
You haven't listed the facts of the case, or explained why the judge decided that an
alcoholic woman was an unfit mother (although I can guess).
<p>
So what's the real truth there?<br>
What kind of a horror story are you glossing over?<br>
And what did the husband get from my web site to tell the judge?<br>
And how did that influence the judge's decision?<br>

<p>
And again, you are trying to reduce the situation to just a pair of poor choices, using
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">the <i>Either/Or</i> Technique</a>.
You failed to mention the third choice: getting the mother into better shape
so that she might actually be a better mother, and warrant having her children more.

</font>
<p>

You could be a person who falls anywhere along the spectrum.  You could
be someone who got pissed at AA because they made you feel like you
should be responsible to a God that you don't want to be judged by.  You
could be a vindictive person just looking for your own niche on this
thing called the internet in order to stab weak-minded people with
emotional daggers.  I know that there are people of both persuasions out
there.  I expect you are at neither end, but I won't know if I don't try
to find out.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are not giving any facts. You are just fishing for an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>Ad Hominem</i></a> attack, and using
the <a href="orange-propaganda.html#Hobsons_choice">&quot;Hobson's Choice&quot; or Alternative Advance</a>
propaganda technique &#8212; only offering two bad choices: I might be either
&quot;pissed&quot; or &quot;vindictive&quot;.
Those things are not opposite ends of a range or &quot;spectrum&quot;, either.

<p>
By your
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions">suggestive illogic</a>, you could also say,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Or you could be a selfless saint who is just
trying to save the world...&quot;</font>

<p>
(Now I'm not saying that I am such a saint, but it makes as much sense as your suggested attacks.)

</font>
<p>

We are dealing with people with warm bodies and real feelings out here.
If given the choice between somebody on the web who is trying
desperately to convince others that they are right in order to justify
their failures or some asinine AA member who tells a sponsee that they
cannot attend their grandmother's funeral, then I say a pox on you all
and I'll just try to provide the most gentle, productive counseling that
I can.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is just so much rationalization and minimization and denial.
You are just using the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#straw_man">Straw Man tactic</a>, setting up and then
 attacking extreme cases, and
also using the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">The <i>Either/Or</i> Technique</a>, again.

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The problematic people are either fools trying to justify their failures

</font>
<p>

You should read the letters I get from suffering people who have been hurt by Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
OK,

<p>
I just sent you a response without checking out what you think about
cults and started feeling guilty.

<p>

Where did you get what you know about AA?  You must've been a member of
a really crazy group.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Ted,
<p>
Read the introduction, and other pages:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction, my introduction to A.A.</a>, and also
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">the &quot;treatment&quot;
bait-and-switch trick</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">another friend goes missing</a>.
</ul>

</font>
<p>

I've heard stories like some of the one's you mention and my response
is, &quot;Those people are out of their minds.&quot;  If I was in a group like
that I'd leave.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, and I left too, but those groups still exist, and get new victims every day.
The courts even sentence people to go to A.A. meetings, without bothering to warn the
people about which groups are bad.
And treatment centers, like mine, just push the 12-Step nonsense in spite of the failure rate.

</font>
<p>

You should get out some more and find out what mainstream AA groups are
like.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I know what they are like. There are some nice mellow people in some groups. But they still start
every meeting by reading Bill Wilson's lies from pages 58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>,
and then they reverently recite more stuff from books like <i>As Bill Sees It</i>...
All of A.A. is contaminated with Bill Wilson's cult religion and misinformation.
</font>
<p>

You're working one of the logical fallacies to its maximum.  You seem to
find every undesirable thing anyone ever reported it and characterize AA
like that.  In the words of Foghorn Leghorn, &quot;It just ain't so son.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, actually, it is like that.
</font>
<p>

My responses to some of your answers.

<p>
<a name="no_Bill"> </a>
#1.  You are wrong.  Bill is a man.  I trust him as much or as little as
I do others.  As I choose.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You may not worship Bill Wilson, but far too many A.A. members do. They won't even correct any of
his mistakes or lies in the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
Some A.A. members even claim that Bill Wilson was divinely inspired when he wrote the <i>Big Book</i>.
</font>
<p>

#2.  I am not always wrong.  Hell, I even knew some of Bill's stuff
before he said it.  My &quot;real&quot; Big Book is what he said he wanted his to
be.  (The Bible.  That's the real secret.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
You may use the Bible as your Big Book, but Bill Wilson merely gave lip service to the Bible.
<p>
And I have never, not once ever, seen somebody bring a Bible into an A.A. meeting and read aloud from it.
The readings in A.A. meetings are <i>ALWAYS</i> the words of Bill Wilson, or other &quot;council-approved&quot;
literature. The Bible is not council-approved literature.

</font>
<p>

#3.  Wrong again.  Even the Big Book says that some people can get sober
on their own.  Didn't you ever hear &quot;This is how we did it&quot;?  It's right
there in the front of the book!

<p>
<font color="blue">
That rap is just one of Bill Wilson's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">bait-and-switch tricks</a>.
Wilson talked out of both sides of his mouth.
<p>
That's just a recruiting tool, sounding so mellow and easy-going to newcomers and potential recruits.
Later, the story changes to:

#4.  You must be thinking binary.  Everything is either 10 or nothing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Are you talking about the cult test? A.A. scores a 10 on a lot of items because they do that stuff.
</font>
<p>

Look.  Let's just save both of us a lot of time and dump this conversation.

<p>

You obviously have never been to a meeting at any place that I have, and
while there are people who act in some of the ways you describe some of
the time, so the hell what?  You're a lonely man if you refuse to go to
clubs with imperfect people as members.

Scientology, The People's Temple, and Alcoholics Anonymous.

Let me leave you with one piece of advice.

<p>

I'm a computer engineer and I've had a couple of bosses that have taught
me something.  &quot;If everything has the highest priority then nothing has
a priority.&quot;

<p>

If you have a scale of one to ten and everything is ten, your scale is
meaningless.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I guess you must be referring to
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html">the Cult Test</a>.
<p>
Those are scores, not priorities.
If A.A. rates a score of 10 out of 10 on an item, I score it at a 10.
<p>
I'm also a computer programmer, and I have thought of writing a cgi-bin program where each question
is weighted for importance. Some questions are more important than others, and would get
greater weight in the final score.
But I don't know if it's really worth the bother to be that extreme.

<p>
Have a good day.

Date:  	Fri, April 27, 2007 2:23 am<br>
From:  	&quot;Andy M. of the U.K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA creed of powerlessness<br>

<p>

Dear Orange

<p>

I just wanted to express a few thoughts on what I have come to think of as the AA
creed of powerlessness, which owes its origin to the weird ideas of Frank
Buchman's Oxford Group, and is advocated by steppers and official AA 'literature'
as a way of dealing with all of life's problem's, not just that of addiction to
alcohol.

<p>

This strange creed of powerlessness which AA members are encouraged to subscribe
to has always struck me as expressing a very skewed and flawed way of looking at
the world.  If individuals really believed that they were powerless to have any
influence for good or ill over people, events and circumstances in their lives,
they would then, in effect, be mere automata, acting out a script of learnt
powerlessness.

<p>

A philosophy (if it can even be dignified with such a name) which teaches that
people are powerless over the circumstances of their lives is, by definition, a
philosophy of fatalistic defeatism.  Incidentally, 'self-help' is the most
inaccurate description of such a philosophy imaginable.

<p>

If people had, historically, followed this crazy, disempowering and defeatist
philosophy en masse, the human race would never have progressed beyond the
barbarities of human sacrifice and cannibalism, slavery would never have been
outlawed, children would still be sent to work down our coalmines and women would
never have gained the vote. No scientific, medical or cultural progress would ever
have occurred.

<p>

It is very worrying that so many people, some occupying positions of power and
influence in the medical establishment and elsewhere, are prepared to abandon
rational thought and take such ideas seriously. My own position is to treat this
AA philosophy of powerlessness with the contempt it deserves subsequent to
investigation. I do not think there are many acts more unhelpful than to offer
desperate and vulnerable people a counsel of despair.

<p>

I have first-hand experience of the Job's comforters who are the 'oldtimers' of AA
inflicting their unsolicited and unwelcome counsel of despair on me when I spoke
in meetings about having to cope with the following issues in sobriety:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
The pain and grief I felt seeing my mother die after two weeks in a coma, with
unresolved questions left concerning possible medical negligence
<li> The shock of the news of the sudden death of my father eight weeks later
<li> Hearing the news of my only brother's death from cirrhosis of the liver two
years after that.
</ul>

<p>

When I spoke about these events in the rooms, I was 11 to 13 years sober, but was
treated with a total lack of respect  because I refused to pretend to believe in
the AA program. I did not, at that time, vociferously object to the program. I
just made it clear that I didn't follow the 'suggestions' and didn't think I owed
my sobriety to AA.

<p>

On the occasions when I spoke about these things, at no time did I ask for any
advice from any other members at the meeting, yet they broke the AA code of not
'cross-sharing' by passing public comment on what I said and pushing unwanted
program-laden advice at me, much of it inevitably based on this poisonous creed of
powerlessness.  This was done in the guise of offering support, but any kind of
recognisable human empathy or compassion were conspicuous by their absence.  The
only thing these people seemed interested in was using somebody else's grief as a
pretext for promoting the creed of powerlessness.

<p>

The responses I got when I expressed my feelings about these tragic events finally
convinced me that I did not want the morbid and unhealthy influence of these AA
people in my life any more.

<p>

I have not looked back. Over two years after my brother's death I have not drunk,
and I have not had a mental breakdown, despite being diagnosed as bipolar. I have
moved forward in my life in many areas, and I have found The Orange Papers to be a
very useful and encouraging resource to help me take full responsibility for my
own recovery and work towards putting my negative experiences in AA behind me.

<p>

By the way, I did everything within my power to resolve the issues surrounding my
mother's last illness and death, with partial success. Whilst I was a long way
from getting an admission of medical negligence from the hospital authorities, I
did get an admission from them that I had not been given the full and true facts
about her medical treatment up to her death and an apology for being unhelpful and
disrespectful towards me during the complaints procedure. I did at least have an
opportunity, at an officially convened meeting, to publicly tell those responsible
for my mother's treatment that I remained unconvinced by their changing accounts
of what occurred, and was considering legal action.

<p>

I had tenaciously contested their differing versions of events for almost a year
to get to this point. I decided not to take the issue further, for fear of
bankrupting myself with legal fees and undermining my health with the stress of a
lengthy court case. However, I still felt much better than I would have done if I
had simply aquiesced in my supposed 'powerlessness over people, places and things'
and done nothing.

<p>

The whole issue was connected with MRSA infection, which was then virtually
unheard of by the British public, but has now long been a huge political and
medical scandal in this country because of poor hygeine standards in National
Health Service hospitals and the preventable deaths of elderly patients.

<p>

With regard to my brother's alcoholism and death from liver failure, I have learnt
many painful lessons from these things. The lessons learned from experience are
sometimes painful and bitter, but the AA creed of powerlessness is downright
poisonous.

<p>

I hope you don't mind my going on so long on this occasion,  but I just felt very
abused and insulted by the behaviour of these steppers, and I wanted to get it off
my chest. I'm sure innumerable other people have had similar experiences. What a
relief it is not to be around those creeps any more!

<p>

Best wishes and keep up the good work

<p>

Andy M

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Andy,
<p>
Thanks for the story. I couldn't agree more. I especially liked your point about &quot;a group that promotes
a philosophy of powerlessness cannot be a 'self-help group'.&quot;
<p>
And this line is good too:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" font="Courier, Hevetica, Sanserif">
&quot;My own position is to treat this AA philosophy of powerlessness
 with the contempt it deserves subsequent to investigation.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, I caught that little twist on &quot;contempt prior to investigation.&quot;
That's good. And that's my attitude too.

<p>
And it's both sad and revealing how quickly the <i>&quot;no cross-talk&quot;</i> and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous does not demand that you believe anything&quot;</i></a>
rules disappear when you challenge their beliefs.

<p>
Oh and congratulations on your continuing sobriety.
<p>
And have a good life.

Hey Orange,

<p>
Hope all is still well!  See that you seem to be getting round to answering
some of your mail!  Good luck with that.  You must be well and truly back
logged!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steven,
<p>
Yes, all is well. And I'm returning to the salt mines for a little while, and trying to get
caught up on the backlogged email.
</font>
<p>

I have two questions.  Firstly, I was thinking of doing a wikipedia article
on the  &quot;the anti AA movement&quot;.  The AA wikipedia article (especially the
&quot;criticism&quot; section) has been sanitised to the point of no return.  Perhaps
some of the criticisms of AA could be documented more effectively away from
the main article?  Anyway, if I do do this, some pointers on where to begin
research (especially around the history) would be useful.

<p>

Also, think it may be an idea to do an article about this website (and a
section on you...) fpr wiki. Would you have any objections to this?

<p>

Lastly, what do you look like?  I always imagine you to have the appearance
of a big, bearded, gentle and cuddlely uncle.  Please tell me this is
true!!!

<p>

Hope to hear from you soon,<br>
Stephen

Hello Stephen,
<p>
<i>The history of opposition to Alcoholics Anonymous</i>:
What an interesting concept. I like that. Well, just off of the top of my head, here's 
what I can think of:

<p>
<ol>

<li>
The earliest public criticism of Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous that I know of is
the popular newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler
writing in 1947 that the A.A. founder was &quot;wet-brained&quot;, and his followers
&quot;effectively deluded&quot;.
I found that in the book
<i>The Soul of Sponsorship: The Friendship of Fr. Ed Dowling, S.J.
and Bill Wilson in Letters</i>, edited by Robert Fitzgerald, S.J.,
page 45.
<p>
I have not been able to find the original newspaper column, and would love to. It wasn't printed in
the New York Times &#8212; they didn't carry his column. But I hear that hundreds of other newspapers did.
(There were a lot more newspapers in those days.) Perhaps it was printed in something like the
New York <i>Herald-Tribune</i>, which is unfortunately now defunct, so we can't search its archives online.

<p>
If any readers ever stumble across that column,
I would love to get a xerox or computer scan of the original
column.
<p>
Or if somebody even just finds the names of some newspapers that
carried Westbrook Pegler's column, that would help in the search.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: 2009.11.28: Found it. Thank you readers, for the references.
</font>

<p>
<li>
In the nineteen-sixties, Dr. Arthur H. Cain wrote two famous magazine
articles that denounced Alcoholics Anonymous.
I have the text of both of those articles here:

<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-ahcain.html">Dr. Arthur H. Cain: First <i>Harper's</i> and <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> articles critical of A.A.</a>
</ul>

<p>

<li>
Then in the 'eighties and 'nineties, Jack Trimpey, Ken Ragge, Stanton Peele, and Charles Bufe
published works that criticized Alcoholics Anonymous. I am not quite sure what the timeline with all
of them was. I suppose you could email them and ask them for the specific details.

<p>
<ul>

<li>
<i>The Small Book</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Jack Trimpey<br>
Dell Publishing, 1992<br>
ISBN: 0-440-50725-1<br>
Dewey: 362.2918 T831s<br>
This was one of the original calls to war against the Evil Empire
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Note that Jack Trimpey has declared this book obsolete, and says
that you should just read the next one, &quot;Rational Recovery.&quot;
The funny thing is, I don't find it to be obsolete.
Trimpey borrowed some techniques from Doctors Maultsby and
Ellis like the ABCs of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and
did a good job of explaining them.
Trimpey did a good job of collecting a variety of
tools for quitting drinking and staying quit and working
them together into a fair toolkit.
This book does what A.A. only claims to do &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#tools">give you
the tools you will need to maintain sobriety</a>".

<p>
<i>Rational Recovery</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Jack Trimpey<br>
Pocket Books, 1996<br>
ISBN: 0-671-52858-0<br>
Dewey: 362.2918 T831r<br>
This is Trimpey's second book about quitting drinking
using rational techniques. He changed his mind about a
lot of things and decided that you only need one technique
to defeat cravings &#8212; the ability to recognize and dispute
the Addictive Voice as it cajoles, wheedles, and seduces
you into having &quot;just one&quot;.
This book is worth reading just for the chapter in the back
that describes a counselling session where Trimpey exposes
&quot;the Beast&quot;,
the addiction monster that tries to con us into drinking or
using again (really, the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">base brain</a>).

Very good. Puts forward the idea that addiction is not a disease, and neither are many
of the other things that are being called mental illnesses these days. The &quot;treatment

And then a woman who used the pseudonym &quot;Apple&quot; published a web site called

This book will curl your hair. One fair-minded 12-Stepper suggested that
every new A.A. member should be issued copies of both the <i>Big Book</i> and this
book when he or she walks in the door, to tell the newcomers about both
the good and the bad things that could happen to them in &quot;the rooms.&quot;
One of the most disturbing repeated themes is women who were the victims
of rape or thirteenth-stepping being told to just shut up and find their
part in it and go make some coffee, and to not harbor any resentments
against their attackers.

<p>
<li>
And then in 2001, I started criticizing A.A. with some essays and papers that got posted to
Apple's <i>A.A. Deprogramming</i> web site.<br>
(Oh, and I adopted the pen name &quot;Orange&quot; so we could joke about mixing apples and oranges...)

<p>
Later, those papers evolved into my own web site.
<p>
I'm really a &quot;Johnny-come-lately&quot; in the game.

<p>

Oh, and then we shouldn't overlook the people who set up alternative recovery groups:
Rational Recovery, Women For Sobriety, S.O.S. (Secular Organizations for Sobriety, or Save Our Selves),
Lifering, SMART...
Again, I'm not sure about the exact time-line on those things. I believe that W.F.S. was the first,
and then R.R., and then SOS, and that Lifering was an offshoot of S.O.S.
(I think.)

WFS is the oldest &#8212; founded in 1975 &#8212; of the modern (non-12-Step) programs,

dedicated to helping women overcome alcoholism and other addictions.
WFS accepts the disease model and is an abstinence program. The &quot;New

SOS is an alternative recovery method for those alcoholics or drug
addicts who are uncomfortable with the spiritual or superstitious
content of widely available 12-Step programs.
SOS takes a reasonable, secular approach
to recovery and maintains that sobriety is a separate issue from
religion or spirituality. SOS credits the individual for achieving and
maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any &quot;Higher
Power.&quot; SOS respects recovery in any form regardless of the path by
which it is achieved. It is not opposed to or in competition with any
other recovery programs.<br>

Rational, sane, common-sense recovery techniques.
Based on Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, the brainchild
of Dr. Albert Ellis.

This is a lot of good sensible advice. Dr. Ellis is the creator of
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), which is the foundation of SMART
(Self Management and Recovery Training).  &#8212; And he's also the founder
of SMART. If you are looking for some realistic, rational, non-superstitious,
common-sense, help in quitting drinking, definitely read this book.
It includes chapters on:
<ul>
<li> &quot;But therapy doesn't work!&quot;
<li> Denial.
<li> How to stop self-defeating BS (stinking thinking).
<li> How to change your stinking thinking.
<li> Integrating rational ideas into your self-help work.
<li> Other cognitive or thinking techniques of RET.
<li> How to get in touch with your feelings.
<li> Relapse prevention.

This book is excellent. It definitely ends up in the Top 10 List of books
that you must read if you are thinking about quitting (or perhaps if
a loved one is trying to quit, or needs to quit).<br>
She covers addiction and alcoholism from a lot of different viewpoints,
including the need for improved nutrition and getting off of other
addictions like nicotine, caffeine, or TV.<br>
She is about the only one who addresses the issue of the narcissism
inherent in A.A., which it got from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic">
the champion narcissist, Bill Wilson</a>.
(Pages 153-154.) She is also the only one to talk about <i>Candida
Albicans</i>, a potentially-devastating yeast infection, in connection
with alcoholism. Something that A.A. all too often fails to consider
is that people kill their pain with alcohol because they are sick and
in pain, not because they are sinful.
Ms. Kasl has the brains to realize this.
<br>
She also covers recovery from the woman's viewpoint better than
anybody else I've seen. This book is simply <i>Must</i> reading for
women alcoholics and addicts.<br>
She also has a good take on the inherently-patriarchal attitudes of
A.A., and the fallacies of codependency.

In spite of its negative title, this is actually a very positive book.
This is one of the best-looking 'alternatives to
A.A.' kind of books that I've seen (from my biased viewpoint, of course).
It definitely contains a very strong
flavor of spirituality, but without the cult religion aspect.
This is a good 'something' for those who try to take the middle road,
for those who try to be spiritual but sensible,
for those who want something other than either atheism or blind
faith in cult religion.

</ol>
One of the things I like best is how Fox stresses just
how damaging and dangerous it is for A.A. and N.A. to teach
addicts that they are powerless over alcohol or their addiction, and
have no choice in the matter. That is a ready-made rationalization
for a drunkard to have another drink, and for a doper to shoot up again.
And that is what the steppers do.
Fox also does a good job of criticizing the arrogant
<i>&quot;My way or the highway&quot;</i>
attitude of self-righteous A.A. and N.A. sponsors.

Quite good. This book makes a good case for the standard ideas

This book is a blockbuster. It is must reading for anyone in the
alcoholism or addictions treatment or rehabilitation field.
It details a lot of the selling of the standard recovery myths,
like selling the idea of codependency and turning its treatment
into an industry, and &quot;recovering&quot; false memories,
and &quot;reparenting&quot;, and more.<br>
And one chapter title is priceless: <i>The Metastasizing of Metaphor</i>.

From:  	Rusty<br>
Subject:  	AA TRUTH FROM A RECOVERED ALCOHOLIC<br>

<p>

Hey Orange I still enjoy reading the letters but that being said I need to
tell you that the FIRST STEP says We WERE powerless. Not we ARE. The first
paragraph of Chapter 2 There is a Solution it says &quot;Nearly all have RECOVERED.
They have SOLVED the drink problem." This before any mention of STEPS. On page 55
it tells us where we find this HIGHER POWER, the great reality is DEEP INSIDE
EACH AND EVERYONE of us. Not a door knob or a totem pole or a palm tree, it
puts  the ball in the alcoholic's court. Then on page 142  TO THE EMPLOYERS
the end of the first paragraph it says SOBER FOREVER  &#8212;  no mention of ONE DAY AT A
TIME. My friend Leo came up to me on my 4th day of SOBRIETY and looked at me
and  said &quot;You are done aren't you" and I said "yes it is OVER." Leo was dead at
38 but  he was a drug addict and they are different. They share their joints,
their  drugs, their needles; ALCOHOLICS do not SHARE, if you don't have yours
you are  not getting any of mine. See AA works 100% as does Betty Ford CEnter
if you are  DONE. AA was not started to get you DONE. I love going to meetings
to say things  that make the new guy THINK FOR HIMSELF not AA GROUP THINK. I
love to harpoon  the old timers that are so in love with BILL and BOB. I do not
get resentments.  It is more fun GIVING them. You seem to be slow in
responding to your mail, don't you know Alcoholics want it RIGHT NOW.  Keep stirring
the pot and I look  forward to your book.
<p>

RUSTY, Albuquerque NM

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rusty,
<p>
Well, starting at the top:
<ol>
<li>
Your interpretation of A.A. teachings about powerlessness is non-standard, to say the least.
Most of the other A.A. apologists tell me that they are only powerless over alcohol after they
have taken the first drink. But that is not what Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>,
and that is not the standard A.A. dogma.
Bill said that alcoholics were powerless over alcohol <b><i>before the first drink</i></b>,
and that there was nothing an alcoholic could do of his own power to prevent relapses:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went carefully over that
evening in Washington.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
I now remembered what my alcoholic friends had told me,
how they had prophesied that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time
and place would come &#8212; I would drink again. They had said that though
I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before some trivial reason
for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and more, for what I had
learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I knew from that moment
that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will power and self-knowledge
would not help in those strange mental blank spots. I had never been
able to understand people who said that a problem had them hopelessly
defeated. I knew then. It was a crushing blow.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 41-42.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<li>
I know that Bill Wilson wrote in the beginning of the <i>Big Book</i>
that &quot;more than 100 men&quot;, or &quot;thousands of men&quot;
<b>&quot;have recovered&quot;</b>, past tense.
Wilson came to regret his words when so many of the &quot;pioneers&quot; relapsed and returned to a life of
drinking,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses">including half of the
first-edition <i>Big Book</i> authors</a>.
So Wilson changed his story to:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily
reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.
Every day is a day when we
<font color="#9F0000">must</font>

<p>
<li> So it's also
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#a_cure">a bait-and-switch trick</a>:
First, you can be cured, alcoholics do recover, and then you don't get cured:
you have to stay in A.A. forever, or else.<br>
<p>
And you stay powerless forever. A popular A.A. slogan declares:<br>
<font color="#8f00bf" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">&quot;I pray to God every day that I never get the idea that I can run my own life.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Really now, when was the last time you saw an Alcoholics Anonymous graduation ceremony where
someone was declared recovered and powerful over alcohol now?

<p>
<li> Because Bill Wilson wrote all of the Steps in the past tense, as
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Here are the steps we took...&quot;</font>,
you cannot infer present or past tense of powerlessness from the statement,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol...&quot;<br>
</font>
In the present tense, it could be either<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I admit that I am powerless over alcohol.&quot;<br>
</font>
or<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I admit that I was powerless over alcohol.&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
<li> Oh, and if you read Henry Parkhurst's words carefully, you will find that
the phrase &quot;sober forever&quot;
does not appear on page 142 of the <i>Big Book</i>. And there sure isn't any such promise there.
Rather, there is this question:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...does he want to get well? You ask, because many alcoholics, being warped and drugged,
do not want to quit. But does he? Will he take every necessary step, submit to anything
to get well, to stop drinking forever?<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, Henry Parkhurst,
Chapter 10, <i>To Employers</i>, page 142.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Henry Parkhurst did not say that the fellow in question would stay sober forever. He asked whether
the guy would submit to anything and do anything &#8212; in other words, sign a blank check to Alcoholics
Anonymous.

<p>
<li> It really is a shame that your friend 
Leo did not benefit from parrotting the A.A. philosophy.
Why did A.A. fail to save his life?
To argue that &quot;drug addicts are different&quot; does not explain the failure of the A.A. program
to help Leo.

<p>
<li>
Alcoholics share. Ever heard of drinking buddies?
I cannot begin to count how many pitchers and six-packs and bottles I
have shared with friends, and they with me.
Just look under the bridge to find the winos passing a jug around.<br>
(Well, not in Albuquerque. I can't think of a single good drinking bridge in Albuquerque.
But you don't need a bridge to stay out of the rain.)


<p>
<li>
A.A. does not work, and neither does the Betty Ford Clinic that sells the 12-Step cult practices.
If you think that A.A. works, why don't you tell us what the actual A.A. success rate is?
(And it sure isn't 100%.)
<p>
<center>
<font color="#9F0000">
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many of them eventually pick up a one-year coin for sobriety?<br>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many of them eventually pick up a five-year coin for sobriety?<br>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many of them eventually pick up a ten-year coin for sobriety?<br>
How about the 11-year coin? What percentage of the newcomers go on to get an 11-year coin?<br>
How many success stories are there really, out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A.?
<p>
How well does Alcoholics Anonymous <i>really</i> work?
</font>

<p>
Hint: the answers are
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
</center>

<p>
<li>
The statement that you have to be &quot;DONE&quot; for A.A. to work means that A.A. does not work.
Only if people are ready, eager, and willing to quit drinking and stay quit will they
successfully quit. That has nothing to do with Alcoholics Anonymous. As you say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;AA was not started to get you DONE.&quot;
</font>
And A.A. cannot and will not make alcoholics &quot;DONE&quot;, and A.A. cannot
make them quit drinking, not any more than A.A. saved the life of Leo.

<p>
<li>
Congratulations on challenging the standard A.A. dogma in meetings.<br>
Now why don't you challenge it a little more, in your own mind, and realize that it is contradictory
and wrong?

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;A. K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Therapists<br>

<p>

Hey AO,

<p>

Once again, you've been a major help in getting me off the stepper and what I like
about you is that you're cheaper than a therapist! but none-the-less.... occasionally
some one-on-one processing from time to time might be helpful with a counselor and I
was wondering if you had a list of therapists that are an alternative to AA pushers?

<p>

Thanks, AK<br>
PS &#8212; Love the photo &#8212; you look younger than your years! ;-)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi A.K.,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. That brightens my day.
<p>
I don't have any list of therapists, but I know where to start looking. There is a good percentage
of qualified counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists among the people who act as facilitators
of SMART meetings.
As you can guess, they are not in any way AA pushers &#8212; they teach Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy
(RBT).
<p>
Technically, SMART meetings are conducted by lay people, non-professionals, but not all of them
are non-professional. Just up the street from me is a building where a Psychiatric Services
branch office of a university conducts SMART meetings, and all of the
meetings are facilitated by the students, or their teachers, or both.

<p>
I would go to the SMART web site, and start making connections:
<p>
<blockquote>
SMART</a>: <i>Self Management And Recovery Training</i>.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221634/http://www.smartrecovery.org/">
http://www.smartrecovery.org/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>

The web site will tell you about local meetings, and you can also log into an online meeting and
start asking around.
<p>
Now you don't have to get a counselor who is a teacher or proponent of SMART,
but I know that somebody there will know somebody
who is into more sane methods than Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
And for that matter, you could also check out WFS, SOS, and LifeRing, and ask there:
