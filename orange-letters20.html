opposition to AA.  I share it on another level.  As a

Jesus' works and wonder about the wine at the banquet,
his first act and the eucharistic host, his last act. 
And of course the war on drugs being religious

Hi Andrew,

Thanks for the letter. &quot;mnia&quot; sure sounds like a typo. What file is
it in? I can't find it with egrep.

You will probably love the file on

Dear Orange,
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     So I register this website drydrunks.com last year so that I can 
promote some things I have been working on. I haven't got around to building 
the site yet. Last week I do a search on google for &quot;Dry Drunks&quot; and your 
site came up.  I was amazed and excited about your work.  A little about me 
...
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My family moved to San Diego from Ireland in 1988.  I was 14.  My 
father was in the bar biz which gave my alcoholism a running start.  I was a 
seasoned drinker at 12.  So at about 21 I realize something isn't right and 
decide to get sober.  You can imagine the reaction from my family and the 
regulars when they heard I was going to AA meetings.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     A recovering Catholic (all boys Christain Brother's school in Dublin) I 
had a problem with AA from the get go.  The &quot;Our Father&quot; prayer had me just 
a little worried.  But because it was the only racket in town I stuck 
around.  No 90 meetings in 90 days ... more like 9 meetings in a year.  I 
read the Big Book, once.  I was annoyed by the right wingers who told me I 
would relapse if I didn't do it their way.  Most of those guys have gone out 
long ago.  I'm in my 7th year of straight sobriety and six years smoke free 
and I did it because I could see the writing on the wall (a bar full of 
miserable SOB's who made my dad rich with their hard earned money) and made 
a decision not to drink anymore.  I stayed sober through years of bartending 
not because of AA, because of me.  Thankfully my family is out of that 
business now.
<p>
<a name="Survivor"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     I almost choked when I read
<a href="orange-jokes.html#Survivor" target="_blank">your joke about a reality show where a 
bunch of drunks are on an island</a>.  It so happens that last year I registered 
a reality show concept where 10 drunks are put in a house and after a week 
of boozing are offered prize money to get sober.  The bar stays fully 
stocked in the living room, and every week they must host a party for all 
their old drinking buddies.  As they relapse they get booted off the show 
(we give them vouchers for treatment before they go).  This week my agent 
has an appointment to pitch the show to the heavy hitters in the industry.  
As you may have guessed I called it Dry Drunks.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     I am also halfway through a book about the misconceptions of 
alcoholism.  I don't directly attack AA (yet) but I do offer another view 
point.  I am very impressed by your work.  When I discuss this issue (my 
friends are sick of hearing about it) I usually have strong disagreement 
with what people say, because most of them are grossly mis-informed.  While 
reading your essays I have not come across one claim or fact that I disagree 
with, and that is unusual.  You really know your stuff and have an excellent 
writing voice.  Have you considered publishing a book?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     The thesis of my book is that alcoholics are not fundamentally flawed 
... just born into a flawed environment.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     It may seem ironic that I come from a lineage of bar owners in Ireland 
and have now diverted my efforts to educating people about alcoholism.  I am 
passionate about the subject and will sooner or later make a living from it.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
     I would like to learn more about you and see if you'd be interested in 
some form of colloboration down the road.  Let me know what you think.
<p>
Sincerely,

Hi Jonathan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Interesting, very interesting. I can see how
working in a bar could turn you off to drinking. I often find that when I go
to concerts where a lot of people are drunk, that rather than being tempted
to join them, I find myself thankful that I am not a slobbering drunk
today.
<p>
Congratulations on so many years off of both alcohol and tobacco.
It's nice to be alive and unhooked, isn't it?

The reality show joke struck me as pretty inevitable for recovering
alcoholics to think of &#8212; it's the ultimate survivor game, one that we
play for real with our own lives.
I live in &quot;the recovery community&quot; of a major city,
and we lose a lot of people. Even my so-called
&quot;<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">treatment program</a>&quot; was
like a game of survivor. Only a tiny part of the starters actually
graduated. Every week the class shrank. It felt a little weird towards the
end, how few of us were left.
That's when I started joking about it being a game of Survivor.
It felt like we were tapering down to the grand final&eacute; when there would
only be one.

<font color="#9F0000">
[UPDATE: 15 JULY 2005:<br>
I just ran into my old floor manager from 4 years ago, the woman who ran
the section of the building I was housed in during &quot;treatment&quot;. She told me that
I was the only one left out of all of the people in &quot;the program&quot; at that time
who still had not relapsed. That surprised me and saddened me. There were some
people there whom I really liked, and had great hopes for, and was sure that they
were going to make it too. I mean, I knew about the deaths from drug overdoses, and
the chronic relapsers who got kicked out of the program, and even those who just
slipped up once or twice, but I felt pretty sure
that some of those people had a handle on it and were going to make it.
It really is like a game of Survivor, and it seems that I'm the last one left
on the island. The million-dollar prize that I win is my life.

About the environmental cause of alcoholism &#8212; I have been collecting my
own list of causes, and it seems to be a lot of things, and just what it
is is different for different people. On my list are:
<ol>
<li> bad environment (both in the social sense, and in the toxic waste dump sense)
<li> genetics
<li> child abuse and poor upbringings, often due to an alcoholic (or drug addict) parent
<li> sexual abuse and rape
<li> poverty and unemployment
<li> hopelessness, bleak outlook on life (often caused by poverty, war,
unemployment, poor educational system, racism, child abuse, and/or mental problems,
particularly depression)
<li> mental illness or emotional disturbances, especially including organic disorders
involving the
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">dopamine</a>,
<a href="orange-Vaillant02.html#beta_endorphins" target="_blank">beta endorphin</a>, or
<a href="orange-letters15.html#serotonin" target="_blank">neurotransmitter</a> systems.
Also chronic depression.
<li> physical illnesses, and using alcohol to kill the pain.
<li> malnutrition (Adelle Davis once said that she thought that kids were
using drugs because they felt bad from the terrible junk-food diets that they were eating.)
<li> a warped philosophy of life which may be due to mental illness
(bipolar disorder comes to mind)
or
being a child of an alcoholic:
<font color="#5f008f">
&quot;You only go around once, so let's live it with all of the gusto we can.
The normal, proper, staid life is hopelessly boring &#8212; what a waste of a life.
Every day is a holiday. Life's a non-stop party.&quot;
</font>
One of the autobiographical stories in the <i>Big Book</i> called alcoholism
&quot;the hilarious life&quot;.

And I suspect that there are a few more that I haven't thought of yet.
<p>
About your remark that,
<font color="black">
&quot;It may seem ironic that I come from a lineage of bar owners in Ireland 
and have now diverted my efforts to educating people about alcoholism.&quot;<br>
</font>
Actually, that doesn't strike me as ironic at all. It seems almost inevitable.
Who but the children of alcoholics, or the children of bar owners,
really knows how bad drinking can get? Who gets a better view?
Who would more want the nightmare to end?

Subject: Afraid to think.
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Agent, I was reading about AA making people afraid to think. When my 
mom was in a 12 step group called Save she loved to quote John Bradshaw 
saying &quot;Your brain is a pig!&quot; It fit in perfectly with the idea that a 
persons thought and intellect shouldn't be trusted.  She's terrified to 
even talk to me about Save anymore. I made the mistake of being critical 
and ever since she rarely talks to me about the group and if the subject 
comes up she gets really weird, and starts pointing at me and telling me 
that I can't eat too fast in this tone of voice that's really kinda 
weird and creepy.
<p>
Sincerely, Drew.

<p><font color="blue">
Hi Drew,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. What you are describing is, unfortunately, just
classic. That is exactly what cults do to people.
That is one of the reasons why I really dislike cults.
<p>
They use the technique called
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">Phobia Induction</a>
to make people afraid to leave the cult, and even afraid to think critical
thoughts about the cult. They of course also teach people
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">Don't Trust Your Own Mind</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">Don't Feel Your Feelings</a>.
Put together, they are really effective for keeping people in the cult
and keeping them from questioning things.
<p>
Your mother is sincerely afraid to let even one critical thought
about the 12-Step program into her head. She fears that if she does,
she will inevitably relapse and die drunk in a gutter. That's what they
keep telling her:

<font color="#5f008f"><i>
&quot;Your best thinking got you here.&quot;</i>
</font>
&#8212;
<font color="#5f008f"><i>
&quot;Utilize, Don't Analyze.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>

<i>&quot;Don't criticize the program&quot;</i> is one of the unwritten
commandments of A.A..

<p>
So she thinks she is fighting for her life by refusing to listen to you.
She believes that you are just misguided and ignorant, and would stupidly
harm her, or even kill her, with your &quot;nonsense&quot;.
She is convinced that the 12-Step program is the only thing that can save
her life.
And of course she
cannot possibly seriously consider what you are saying,
because she thinks that would be her undoing.
<p>
So, in some kind of terrible irony, her thinking really is screwed up because
she believes that she cannot trust her own mind.

<p>
How sad.
<p>
<a name="Hassan1"> </a>
Is there any way to help her? I think so, but it is difficult.
I like Steve Hassan's book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank">
<i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>,
where he tells about the technique of criticizing some other cult.
Cult members are quick to agree that some other group is a cult,
brainwashing people, inducing phobias, and such. (That is
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_hypocrisy" target="_blank">standard cultish hypocrisy</a>.)

So Hassan suggests that rather than criticizing the cult that someone is in,
criticize a similar cult for its many faults and mistreatment of its members.
Talk about the mind control techniques that the other cult uses,
and how terrible it is that they do such things to people.
Scientology and the Moonies are great examples of controlling cults.
Then maybe, eventually, the light will come on as similarities begin
to occur to her.
But you have to take it very slow and easy. As you have already seen, she
will spook and run at the slightest hint of criticism of the 12-Step
program.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Whoever writes this seems to miss the point that anybody who understands AA knows
that it's program is not about quitting drinking but about living a life with a
central philosophy. Many people quit drinking on their own but are miserable about
it and act out their petulance and childishness. It is always said that if the
program were about quitting drinking, there would be no need for the program because
any one can do that. Giving up drinking creates a large displacement and AA meetings
help fill that void by teaching a philosophy.

<p><font color="blue">
Hello, M.E.,
<p>
I very much understand that for some true believer A.A. old-timers, A.A. is a
central philosophy and a completely defined &quot;way of life&quot; with
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater" target="_blank">a well-defined God</a>.
But that is a problem, not an answer. That unquestionably makes Alcoholics
Anonymous a religion, and a dishonest and deceptive religion at that.
When the A.A. headquarters runs those recruiting commercials on late-night
television, they do not tell people that A.A. is a &quot;central philosophy&quot;
or a religion.
They present A.A. as simply a helpful neighborhood get-together of people
whose goal is to quit drinking and help each other to stay sober.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
[And when a judge
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">sentences people to A.A. meetings</a>, it is because he was told
that A.A. is some kind of a quit-drinking program, not a religion.]
</font>
<p>
It's a bait-and-switch trick:
First A.A. is purported to be a helpful quit-drinking program, and then
it's a religion with a central philosophy of Buchmanism,
which Bill Wilson derived from
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman's 
fascistic Oxford Groups cult religion</a>.
<p>
See the file on
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">The Bait-And-Switch Con Game</a> for
more on the bait-and-switch games.
See the file on
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">The Religious Roots of the Twelve Steps</a>
for more on the religious history of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Alas, the A.A. headquarters is simply following Bill Wilson's original strategy
for
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the
spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them.
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font>
is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, pages 76-77.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

But they don't talk about
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>the real purpose</i></font> of A.A. in those TV commercials, do they?
<p>
The A.A. history book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, by Bill Wilson,
described the debate surrounding
the creation of the <i>Big Book</i>, <i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>,
where the early A.A.
members debated about how much truth to tell to the public:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Fitz wanted a powerfully religious document; Henry and Jimmy would have none of it.
They wanted a psychological book which would lure the reader in; when
he finally arrived among us, there would then be enough time to tip him
off about the spiritual character of our society. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; As umpire of these
disputes, I was obliged to go pretty much down the middle, writing in
spiritual rather than religious or entirely psychological terms.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>
(1957), William G. Wilson, page 17.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, Bill says, he compromised and downplayed the
religious nature of the organization, and only told part of the truth, in
order to &quot;lure the reader in&quot;.
That is deceptive recruiting. And A.A. is still doing that today.
<p>
Ask yourself, what kind of a religion deceives prospective recruits
about its true nature? What kind of a philosophy is that?

<p>
Your second sentence perpetuates
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong" target="_blank">the standard cultish put-down of
alcoholics</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Many people quit drinking on their own but are miserable about
it and act out their petulance and childishness.
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>
That is just the standard A.A. stereotype of &quot;the alcoholic&quot; and it is not
a valid generalization at all. Read the file
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i>
Conspiracy</a>&quot; for more on that.
Notice how your put-down of all alcoholics in general is simply a lame
attempt to rationalize shoving a cult religion on strangers.
<p>
I strongly disagree with that stereotype of &quot;alcoholics&quot;.
It isn't true at all. Alcoholics are all different, and the majority do
not suffer from the personality defects that you describe. And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">they do just fine without
Alcoholics Anonymous</a> or its &quot;philosophy&quot;.

<p>
By the way, where did you get your information?
What study, poll, survey, or psychological profiles established that
those who quit drinking &quot;are miserable about it&quot; and &quot;act out their
petulance and childishness&quot;?
Who says that they all have petulance and childishness? (Besides the
standard A.A. propaganda...)
<p>
Besides which, why don't you speak for yourself?
Are you personally so miserable and petulant and childish, or is it just everybody else?

<p>
Your third and fourth sentences again simply attempt to justify shoving
a deceptive religion on the newcomers:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
It is always said that if the
program were about quitting drinking, there would be no need for the program because
any one can do that. Giving up drinking creates a large displacement and AA meetings
help fill that void by teaching a philosophy.
</blockquote>
</font>

<p>
Curiously, you say that &quot;anybody can quit drinking&quot;.
But other A.A. true believers tell me again and again that alcoholics are
<i>powerless over alcohol</i> and that they simply cannot quit drinking on their own,
and that only through A.A. can they quit drinking and save their own lives...
So which is it?
Easy to quit, or impossible to quit?
<p>
To claim that A.A. meetings &quot;fill that void by teaching a
philosophy&quot; is another grandiose generalization.
What philosophy?
<ul>
<li> Deceptive recruiting?
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_end_justifies" target="_blank">The end justifies the means</a>?
<li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">Thirteenth-stepping</a>

<li>

</ul>
<p>
Oh, by the way, notice the arrogant presumption that alcoholics do not already
have a religion or a philosophy of their own (or that
<a href="orange-recruit.html#believer" target="_blank">their own beliefs aren't good enough</a>).
That arrogance also came from Bill Wilson, who constantly declared or
implied that everybody

[Thu, July 22, 2004, 2nd letter from M.E.:]
<p>

Thank you for writing back... 
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Perhaps your experience with A.A. is different than mine and perhaps we're
talking about different things.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That's the propaganda and debating technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank"><i>Escape via Relativism</i></a>.
It isn't a matter of your experiences versus my experiences.
I am not just talking about my experiences in some A.A. meetings.
In fact, my personal experiences are almost irrelevant. I am talking
about the immense failure rate of A.A. treatment of alcoholism,
and
the deceptive recruiting practices that include the A.A. headquarters
running those commercials on late night TV, and many more things like that.
Those things will remain the same no matter whether we go to pleasant
or unpleasant A.A. meetings.
<p>
In addition, both you and I have gone to meetings that post the same
12 Steps and 12 Traditions on the wall, and then they start the
meetings by reading the same dogma
and untrue statements from pages 58 and 59 of the same <i>Big Book</i>,
and then they push the same theology (or &quot;philosophy&quot;, as you called it)...

</font>
<p>
I do not deny that there is more than one road
to &quot;sobriety&quot; and I agree that many people quit on their own.
I always wish
people well when they say that AA is not for them. AA is not the comprehensive
solution but it is a solution and that is all that it claims to be.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but that is again an attempt at <i>Escape via Relativism</i>.
It isn't a matter of &quot;your path to sobriety&quot; versus mine.
A.A. is not a path to sobriety.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#five_unrelapsed" target="_blank">
The &quot;spiritual&quot; A.A. treatment of alcoholism does not work</a>,
and A.A. routinely lies to hide that fact. A.A. is merely
a cult religion that pretends to be a cure for alcoholism
(or not even a cure, but just a perpetual &quot;treatment&quot;
for alcoholism that you can't ever quit because it never finishes the job
of actually fixing you).
</font>
<p>


I don't
know if  you are related to Jack Trimpey but I know that there is a similar
tone about your feelings.
<p>
I hope this finds you well.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I am not related to Jack Trimpey. I have never met him or had any
correspondence with him. But I am coming to understand why he feels the
way that he does.

I am well, and I hope you are well too. Have a good day.

<p><font color="blue">
Hello nymensch,
<p>
No, I am not &quot;RR&quot;. R.R. does not exist any more, and I was never a member of R.R..
I notice that you have not challenged the accuracy any of what I have written.
You seem to be conceding that my facts are correct, and you just complain
about my tone of voice as I tell the truth.
<p>
Do you find it unreasonable to sharply object to friends being harmed, or even
killed, by quack medicine?
Do you just smile and twiddle your thumbs while someone harms one of your
friends? (Perhaps because
Bill Wilson wrote that
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#disturbed" target="_blank">you are
&quot;axiomatically spiritually at fault&quot; if you get disturbed</a>...)
<p>
Remember that AA-Trustee Doctor George E. Vaillant (also Professor of Psychology
at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
his A.A.-based treatment program had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
In addition,
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for public drunkenness
in a group of street drunks.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a>
that A.A. just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
make them need more expensive hospitalization later.
<li>
And I have seen with my own eyes
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">the immense dropout rates of A.A. and N.A.</a>,
and how the 12-Step dance doesn't actually work.
</ul>
<p>
So I have good reason to be angry at the fools who stubbornly ignore,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">minimize and deny</a> all facts
about the down side of A.A.,
and refuse to hear the truth, and
just insist on shoving A.A. on more victims anyway (because they like A.A.,
facts be damned).
<p>
Also notice how you try to dismiss indisputable facts as &quot;AA bashing&quot;.
That's the standard propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#name_calling" target="_blank">name-calling</a>, or
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i></a>.
Just declare that the critic is an &quot;AA-basher&quot;, and then ignore everything
that he says.
<p>

Lastly, you said that you couldn't find what I recommend to quit.
I have said it over and over again. The first thing that works is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">spontaneous remission</a>.
People just quit drinking. They get sick and tired
of being sick and tired, and they finally just quit killing themselves.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Medical School
reported</a> that slightly over 50% of all alcoholics
eventually quit drinking and save their own lives, and 80% of those winners do it
alone, without any treatment or &quot;support group&quot;.
<p>
You ask how I recommend that people quit drinking?<br>
It is very simple: Just quit putting ethyl alcohol into your mouth and swallowing
it.<br>
Do the one-step program: Just quit drinking.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Just don't take that first drink, no matter what.</i></font>

<p>
If you simply <i>must</i> have a program with steps, I made up
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#four_step" target="_blank">a simple four-step program</a>:

<p>
<font size="+1">
<ul>
<li> 1. I admit that drinking and smoking has gotten to be a
real drag, and I am suffering so much that it isn't any fun any more.
<p>
<li> 2. I quit, and I'm staying quit forever.
<p>
<li> 3. Some of my friends may help me occasionally, but I'm mainly
going to count on myself.
<p>
<li> 4. Whenever I am tempted to relapse, I will think
about step one again, and remember
why I quit in the first place. I will also remember what
happened the last time I relapsed.
</ul>
</font>
<p>
It works for me.

<p>
And then I have written about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">the Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
Understanding that has been a big help to me for avoiding relapses.
For me, quitting is hard, but staying quit is even harder, because of that
little voice that routinely whispers that it will be okay to just have one...
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;We've got it under control now, we could have one fun evening and it will be
okay...&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>

And if people feel like having some company and moral support, they can go
to a meeting &#8212; SMART, WFS, SOS, whatever. Heck, they can even go to A.A. meetings,
as long as they know what the truth is,
and are not bothered by knowing that every meeting is opened by reading a list
of lies:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<i>&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...<br>
...they seem to have been born that way.<br>
...if you are willing to go to any length...<br>
...the result was nil until we let go absolutely.<br>
...alcohol &#8212; cunning, baffling, powerful!<br>
Here are the steps we took, which are suggested...&quot;<br>

Subject: Great thread!

<p>
Man, what a great thread.

<p>
I quit drinking. And then I started going to meetings because I was
serious about stopping and wanted the support.

<p>
But I was raised in a Christian Fundamentalist home, and developed a
healthy sensitivity toward cultish behavior early in life. So I was
unsurprised by the &quot;sponsor-recruiters&quot; that initially approached me. I
was also able to reject the mindset of &quot;do exactly as we say or you'll
relapse.&quot; And the &quot;Big Book&quot; and it's infallibility presumption to me is
just laughable.

<p>
I continue to go to meetings, however, because there is a sense of
honesty, camaraderie and mutual support there that it is difficult if
not impossible to find in our modern society.  I accept the AA bullshit.
It's just AA BS. I feel sad for people, though, who have no defenses
against it.

<p>
Early on, I noted that the introductory readings at the beginning of
each days meeting specifically states that &quot;the only requirement for
membership is the desire to stop drinking.&quot;

<p>
That's reason enough for me to attend AA Meetings for now. I made my
mind very clear on this point early on, too, to the other members. Some
members are suspicious of me, some don't care one way or the other, and
some I think are curious. Of course, everyone is waiting for me to
crash, but the risk of relapse exists for anyone who chooses to stop
drinking.

<p>
I don't intend to &quot;buy the farm&quot; in AA. But in lieu of other
alternatives, I'll take it.

<p>
Again, great thread.

Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for a flattering letter.
And thanks for your viewpoint.
And what's funny is how many people have
told me that
<a href="orange-letters13.html#co_dependent" target="_blank">they don't really believe in the A.A. theology or philosophy</a>,
or even that the 12 Steps work,
and they just go to meetings for the companionship and moral support while quitting.
Apparently, the true believers don't have quite as much company as they
like to claim... :-)

Subject: Just a little note

<p>
I've been clean from alcohol for about 14 months. I stopped simply
because I was bored with it and it simply wasn't worth the effort when
considering the consequences.

<p>
I tried AA a few weeks after I stopped on the assumption that I wasn't
suffering from any physical or mental urges but wanted to see if they
had any experiences with the long term urges. Of course I'd heard about
people quitting and &quot;relapsing&quot; and figured they might have a few good
ideas on the topic. It's also relatively cheap and I figured a few hours
spent there wouldn't hurt.

<p>
The first group I tried were a cliquish group of Jesus freaks who
figured that some newbie would be aware of their rules. They apparently
had rules against asking questions about the steps in meetings. So they
gave me a list of people to call after the meeting and it turns out that
the folks on the list weren't interested or had just started themselves.
Why they put their numbers on the list escaped me but I went a few more
times.

<p>
I was asked more than once where I lived and couldn't work out why.
Eventually I got the &quot;hint&quot; that they wanted me not to attend their
meetings. I suppose asking questions during &quot;sharing&quot; was a black mark
on their record. I could never, and still can't, accept the idea that I
was powerless and needed a &quot;god of my choosing&quot; to take credit for
anything positive I did and blame myself for any faults.

<p>
So I tried another group. Some &quot;old timer&quot; asked me if I was willing to
do *anything* and that just freaked me out. I still hadn't figured out
what I did that was so bad or thoughtless other than going to that crew
that would make me want to be so desperate to promise I would do anything.

<p>
They really didn't like the idea I would go to bars, keep booze in my
home or [not] give up any of my friends that drank. I hung around there for a
few months and decided to check out a different one.

<p>
The third group seemed a little more flexible so I began speaking my
mind. I was told that I didn't belong there in front of the whole group
of 30 or so persons after I said over a period of 2 months that:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
a: when I first attended AA I didn't understand 99% of what they were
saying.

<p>
<li>
b: after 3 months it got better, I didn't understand 95%.

<p>
<li>
c: I thought the chapter on &quot;atheists&quot; was a load of crap.

<p>
<li>
d: a lot of the &quot;war stories&quot; were dicksize wars and I got tired of
hearing the same shit over and over. Not to mention the slogans. It's
repetitive and not conductive to any kind of spiritual development but
more akin to brainwashing.

<p>
<li>
e: a lot of the material was completely devoid in logic and the
arguments were full of holes,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#straw_man" target="_blank">strawmen</a>
and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">ad hominems</a>.

<p>
<li>
f: faith in someone who would foist a piece of tripe like the BB isn't a
very compelling argument.  The one excuse I was given for the BB is that
it was done by a committee. Let's just say I think the committee had
very little power other than getting some of the really blatant nonsense
out and fixing the grammar or they were at least as batshit as Bill.
</ul>

<p>
I stuck around for another month or so but it seemed that the only
people who would call on me to share were people that were either just
going around the room or people who weren't familiar with my views. Of
course the times I was called upon to share otherwise dwindled drastically.

<p>
I eventually looked around and found some other alternatives that would
actually welcome honest questions and serious discussion. I couldn't
believe that none of the crew at any of the AA groups ever mentioned
those. That remains my main *personal* beef against AA. I'm not pissed
they tried to sell me on something that's flawed, I'm pissed that they
insulted my intelligence.

<p><font color="blue">
Hi Kevin,
<p>
Indeed. That is also one of the things that really irritates me, too.
There is a clique of professional A.A. propagandists who continue to crank out the
most moronic, deceptive articles that promote A.A. with grossly false misinformation
and bad logic, and I find it insulting that they think that I am stupid
enough to be fooled by them.
Look <a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">here</a>
for some of that stuff.
(Although I have to stop and remember that maybe it is somebody else who
is the target of that stupid propaganda...)
</font><p>

After a while I found this and other sites that are anti-AA. While I
don't agree with 100% of the stuff here, I feel that it questions a lot
of the base assumptions of the 12 step cult and does it correctly.

<p>
I'm not sure about some of the things here as I'm always wary of things
being taken out of context but it has encouraged me to at least take the
time to research your material and come up with my own opinions. Some of
the biggest obstacles are in getting pro-AA materials in the libraries,
I certainly wouldn't respect myself for subsidizing their continued
existence by paying for their materials.

<p><font color="blue">
About taking things out of context &#8212; I am very careful not to do that.
A pro-A.A. critic accused me of that earlier, and my answer to her is
<a href="orange-letters12.html#context" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
About the pro-A.A. materials, I know how you feel. I have never bought an A.A. book new,
but I did get a couple of them cheap from used book stores. I have been lucky and got
a lot more as give-aways, mostly from people who were quitting the
12-Step dance.
<p>
Oh, and you can now download the entire A.A. <i>Big Book</i> for free
over the Internet, without giving the A.A. headquarters a single penny.
The first two editions are not under copyright &#8212;
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#copyright_invalid2" target="_blank">the copyrights are invalid</a>.<br>

http://www.recovery.org/aa/download/BB-plus.html</a><br>
and grab some <i>Big Book</i> study materials for free.
</font><p>

<p>
Hell, I really don't expect you to be able to answer all possible
arguments and nit-picking, you simply could never find the time.

<p>
Your site and the others I've found have convinced me it's not me that's
insane, it really is them.
<p><font color="blue">
Correct. It isn't you who is insane; it's them. Heck, I even ended up
diagnosing Bill Wilson as a textbook nutcase of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Narcissistic Personality
Disorder</a>
with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">Delusions of Grandeur</a>.
His ravings in the <i>Big Book</i> leave little doubt that the poor fellow was
insane.

<p>
In addition, Michael Lemansky found a study where psychologists
found that the majority of A.A. members were mentally disturbed.
When you walk into an A.A. meeting room, most of the people who try to
tell you how to live are not qualified to teach you anything about it.
Look
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Lemanski" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font><p>

<a name="Scientology_rejects"> </a>
I consider myself lucky. I know people who have to deal with cults, I'm
agnostic and I'm skeptical. One of my friends gets to work with families
who are thrown out by the Church of $cientology after their life savings
are drained and all possible money from loans are wrung out of them.
<p><font color="blue">
Yes, the Church of Scientology is a real monster, isn't it?
I use them for some good examples of cult behavior in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>.
</font><p>

<p>
I'm not saying that I consider AA as bad as the Co$, (I don't have any
experience with the &quot;institutional AA&quot;), but they sure have the same
base - thought control.
<p><font color="blue">
I agree. A.A. is not quite as bad as Scientology.

And yes, institutional A.A. is worse than the open A.A. meetings.
The 'friendly' little neighborhood meeting is just the tip of the iceberg
of the &quot;Evil Empire&quot;.
The local meetings are just the smiley-face front of the organization.
Money-grubbing institutional A.A. is
where I got my cocaine-snorting, whiskey-guzzling, child-molesting
12-Step &quot;<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">counselor</a>&quot;
who insisted that Rational Recovery was no good because
we should have a &quot;Higher Power&quot; in our recovery programs.
</font><p>

There are a few good lessons I learned from them, but they could have
been learned in less than an hour.

<p><font color="blue">
Indeed. I still think that the single best thing I ever got from A.A. is simply<br>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Just don't take that first drink, no matter what.&quot;</font><br>
That is such a simple program &#8212; no Steps, no sponsor, no goofy theology, no
slogans, no crazy book. Just one rule.
</font><p>

Most of those were things I had to
relearn in a different setting but still it could have be done in the
time that one meeting would take. It's too bad that unlearning
everything they tell you takes a lot longer. I feel that's the legacy
that they'll leave behind.

<p><font color="blue">
Yeh, really. And some doctors have complained that A.A. has essentially
&quot;poisoned the well&quot; with its immense amounts of misinformation about
alcoholism and recovery. Many of the A.A. slogans like &quot;Nobody can do it alone&quot;,
&quot;Powerless over alcohol&quot;,
&quot;You must hit bottom&quot;,
and &quot;You must have a support group&quot;
have permeated society to the point that they have been accepted as true
information, which they are not.
It will take a long time to clear the air.
Heck, the cult isn't dead yet. They are still actively proselytizing and
promoting the dogma.
</font><p>


There's a real resistance to change that is obvious, it seems they're
20-50 years behind the knowledge of a subject they claim to know. I look
forward to seeing this dinosaur hitting the tar pits. The sooner, the
better.

<p>
I hope I haven't bored the hell out of you and that someone might learn
something from my experiences.

<p>
Dubious? As opposed to whose &quot;unquestionably true&quot; political bias?
<p>
I find that I am unable to keep politics out of my discussion of recovery methods
because the recovery
industry is highly political. The War On Drugs is political. Having Medicare
or state funds finance treatment centers that foist the 12-Step treatment
on people is political.
White House financed &quot;faith-based&quot; social programs are political.
Having courts, prisons, and parole systems push
people into 12-Step meetings is highly political, and well as a violation of
the Constitutional separation of Church and State.
<p>
And then there is the mind-set tie-in.
The same intellectual dishonesty that allows
some cult members to foist quack medicine on sick people for 60 years
while claiming that it is for their own good also
allows
some other people to foist a war for oil on the American people, while passing
it off as a war on terrorism and rationalizing that it is for the good of
America.
Cult members are not just dishonest with others, they even lie to themselves.
<p>
A very relevant book on that subject is
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Deikman" target="_blank"><i>The Wrong Way Home, Uncovering the Patterns of
Cult Behavior in American Society</i></a>, by
Arthur J. Deikman, M.D., which does a beautiful job of showing how
patterns of cultish behavior permeate a lot of our institutions,
including our churches, corporations, and government.
<p>
You can start off talking about Alcoholics Anonymous, which leads you to
discussions of cult behavior and cult psychology, which leads into politics.
It's all an interconnected matrix.

Bill Wilson's religious pomposity.
And I find that I sometimes use

but I try to keep that to a minimum.

<p>
I can't seem to open the page that you sent. Sorry.
Please try again as I am interested.

<p>
By the way, I have found your work to be more than interesting, it
was eye opening.
I have a scientific and skeptical background and of course I found AA to be
a type of evangelical Christian
faith healing that I never actually believed, but thought was at most
benign.

<p>
Twenty five years around the program has convinced me otherwise. The
profound idea that is implanted by AA
of &quot;progression&quot; and worse and worse bottoms seems to have made many people
who have &quot;slipped&quot; go to
extreme depths because of that intrinsic belief. Ideas are powerfull things,
small wonder the death rate of relapsers
in AA is higher than in the untreated sample.

<p>
One saying in AA is that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing
over and over and expecting different results.
Yet I have seen so many that keep failing and coming back in depression and
shame, over and over again. Yet they expect
different results &quot;this time&quot; from AA. They blame themselves. (i.e) They
&quot;took their will back from God&quot; or did not do step four well enough, or they
reduced the number of meetings attended from five per week to two, or they
did not call thier sponsor every day. It never occurs to them that the
program itself has failed them because AA is founded on both junk science
and a simplistic junk concept of religion. If someone can tell me what a
&quot;spiritual disease&quot; is, I will look at my calendar and assume I am back in
the 13th century.

<p>
After twenty five years around the program I can count on my hands the
number of people who are still around.(Out of  thousands and thousands that
I have seen attend meetings.) Most are not dead either, or in jails or
hospitals.  Perhaps some  &quot;recovered&quot;, perhaps some have occasional drinking
episodes that they manage without undue disaster, perhaps some were never
alcoholics at all. The rooms &quot;change&quot; faster than people &quot;change&quot;.
The five per cent per year solution seems to be about right.

<p>
Your work has crystallized that which I was almost afraid to express. Your
research as been a great asset for me in this.
However, I still find your political bias to be a distraction from your work
and should be cleaned up.
<p>
Vote for George Bush for President.

<p>
Kind Regards

<p>
Thad.

Hi Thad,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments.

<p>
The &quot;political bias&quot;, as you call it, is an inseparable part of my
world view. The same desire for the truth that prompts me to investigate
alcoholism cures or treatments, Alcoholics Anonymous, and other cults, also
prompts me to look for the truth in political matters. It's all a part
of our survival. What good will it do us to recover from alcohol and
tobacco only to be killed by pollution done by Bush's campaign contributors?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I guess you really have not learned your own lessons about fallacy.
Is the argument the truth or not?
Or, I suppose you want people to believe that it is not because of a
spelling error.
Yeah, that's the ticket, a misprint makes it false.

Hi Jerry,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I needed some excitement today.
<p>
First off, the propaganda trick that you are trying to pull is called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#nitpick" target="_blank">Nit-Picking</a>&quot;.

That is the technique where you try to find just one tiny little error in something, like
perhaps an erroneous page number on a quote, or a misspelling,
and then you declare that the whole thing
is invalid and untrue. That is false logic. The last nit-picker tried to claim
that the whole web site was invalid because I had misspelled the name
&quot;Henrietta Seiberling&quot;.
<p>
But I am not wrong. You'd better look again.
I am holding in my lap two copies of
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> as I type this, one hard-cover and one
paperback, and both books say this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our

disobedience to spiritual principles.<br>
</font>
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 174.
</blockquote>
<p>
...which really means:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

</blockquote>
<p>
The hardcover book is copyright 1952, 1953, first printing April 1953,
27th printing November 1984, ISBN 0-916856-01-1.
(So that's what I have, the 27th printing.)
<p>
The paperback book is copyright 1952, 1953, 1981, 29th printing, 1998,
ISBN 0-916856-29-1.
(So I have the 29th printing of the paperback.)

See the 5th and 6th sentences in the second paragraph of page 174.
Just in case you have an odd copy with different page numbering,

<a name="convention"> </a>
As for the success rate of AA &#8212; Have you been to an
international convention and seen the countdown of years of sobriety in a stadium
environment??? I think not.

<p><font color="blue">
Again, that is false logic. You are assuming a cause-and-effect
relationship where none exists. Just because someone gathers a bunch of
sober people in a room does not prove that the meeting made them get sober.
<p>
Neither does it prove that their sobriety was caused by the room, the hard
seats, the organization, the cult religion, the bad coffee, or anything else.
You do not really know <i>what</i> made them get sober.
You are just getting swept up in the emotional hoopla at big parties and
making groundless assumptions.
(It isn't <i>all</i> your fault &#8212; those ceremonies are cleverly designed
to fool you and make you believe what they are selling.)

<p>
The Moonies and the Scientologists also have big conventions every so often, where
they claim that their big crowd proves that their crazy beliefs are all
unquestionably true. Are they?
<a href="orange-Moonies000213.jpg" target="_blank">Look at this</a>:

</center>

Do you think that they don't find their conventions &quot;inspiring&quot;?

<p>
The real reason why people quit drinking is because they get sick and tired
of being sick and tired, and decide to quit drinking and save their own lives.
Others decide that alcohol is wrecking their lives and costing them too much,
so they quit drinking.
Then Alcoholics Anonymous manages to fool a few of them into believing
that A.A. somehow <b><i>caused</i></b> them to quit drinking (in spite of the fact
that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Robertson_already_quit" target="_blank">many of them
actually quit drinking before they came to A.A.</a>).

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Plus, you are pointedly ignoring the many millions of other people who
came to A.A. seeking help but who did not get sober in the A.A. program.
You are only looking at the successes, and ignoring the many more failures
who don't go to the conventions.
That is the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank"><i>Observational Selection</i></a>
&#8212; i.e., &quot;cherry picking&quot;.<br>
(And then you probably dismiss the failures with an argument like Bill Wilson's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank"><i>Lying with Qualifiers</i></a> &#8212;
they don't count because
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="_blank">they didn't
really try</a>&quot; or 
&quot;they didn't work a strong program&quot;
or &quot;they didn't keep coming back&quot;.)

<p><li>
And you really are not looking at the people who have been harmed or killed
by A.A. misinformation and misbehavior, like the
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications" target="_blank">no medications</a>&quot;
nonsense, the
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank">powerless over
alcohol</a>&quot; doctrine, and the
<a href="orange-cult_a5.html#sexual_exploitation" target="_blank">sexual exploitation of newcomers</a>.

<p><li>
You are also ignoring
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">lots of other evidence</a>, even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">the research done by one of your own leaders</a>,
Professor George E. Vaillant, who is a member of the
Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.. He tried
for eight years to make A.A. show good results in a test, but finally,
in the end, he had to report
that A.A. had totally failed to help the alcoholics, and that the A.A.
program had an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate. Check it out.
</ul>

<p>
So they are using at least four propaganda techniques on you at
those conventions when they do the &quot;countdown of years of sobriety&quot;:

<p>
Jerry 

<p>
<font color="blue">
Your statement that alcoholism is a disease and
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;cunning, baffeling [<i>sic., sp.</i>] and powerful&quot;</i></font>
is just parroting Bill Wilson's ridiculous nonsense in the <i>Big Book</i>.
See pages 219, 227, and 58-59 of the third edition, and
pages 205 and 58-59 of the fourth edition, for the disease theory and Bill's
declaration that alcohol was &quot;cunning, baffling, and powerful&quot;.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Alcohol is not cunning. It has no brain at all.
Ethyl alcohol is a flammable hydrocarbon solvent that is similar to gasoline.
It does not cleverly scheme to get you. It does not think at all.
<li>
Alcohol is not baffling. We understand it pretty well.
The formula is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH.
It's just an ethane molecule with an oxygen atom added.
One of the easiest ways to get ethanol is to let yeast consume sugar, 
which produces ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide.
<li>
Now alcohol might be powerful, if you are drinking high-proof whiskey or everclear.
</ul>
<p>
Likewise, &quot;alcoholism&quot; doesn't have a brain either, so it is not cunning and
baffling either. And to call it &quot;powerful&quot; is a senseless misuse of language.

<p>
The error that Bill Wilson made there is called &quot;anthropomorphization&quot;
&#8212; making an inanimate object into a person.
Bill liked to portray alcohol as a bogeyman who was
stalking you in the dark, always scheming to get you,
<i>&quot;cunning, baffling, powerful!&quot;</i>
(So <a href="orange-recruit.html#spiritual_conquer" target="_blank">you needed his &quot;Higher Power&quot;</a>
to save you from the monster.)
That is completely untrue nonsense, just a grim fairy tale for scaring the children.
That's also standard cult behavior. See Cult Test item 34:
<i><a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">The Cult Implants Phobias</a></i>.
<p>
Likewise, alcohol over-indulgence is habitual behavior, not a &quot;disease&quot;.
People can certainly make themselves sick, very sick, even dead,
from drinking too much
alcohol, but that does not make alcoholism a disease like cancer or tuberculosis.
Alcoholism is no more a disease than &quot;candyism&quot; is a disease.
&quot;<a href="orange-jokes.html#candyism" target="_blank">Candyism</a>&quot;
is the &quot;spiritual disease&quot;
that children get from eating too much ice cream and candy.
<p>
Bill Wilson and A.A. tell us that alcoholism is a progressive disease
that is
<a href="orange-aalies.html#causes" target="_blank">caused by spiritual wrongs,
defects of character, moral shortcomings, and The Seven Deadly Sins</a>.
If alcoholism is really caused by immorality,
then it isn't a disease at all. It's a behavior problem.
<p>
Then you say,
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;...and you sir are a sad example of its prowess.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
That is just an unsupported slur,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">character assassination</a>
at its best.
I suppose you think that I am sick because I criticize
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">the falsehoods</a>
that are promulgated by your favorite cult.
You probably imagine that I am a
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html" target="_blank">dry drunk</a>&quot; because I
believe in telling the truth rather than yammering your favorite fables of choice,
right?<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(But what does it say about your mind and your honesty that you insist on repeating
A.A.'s lies, distortions, and falsehoods for years and years,
and foisting a
completely ineffective quack medicine treatment on sick people who come
to A.A. seeking help to survive alcoholism?
Why do you stubbornly refuse to see the obvious truth about A.A.'s failure rate when
the evidence is right in front of your eyes?
<i>Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.</i>)
</font>

<p>
Then you switch modes and piously say that you will pray for me &#8212;
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;I will pray for you as I would any
other sick and suffering alcoholic and wish you only the best.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
No thanks. Please don't bother. Go pray for yourself.
I prefer honest hostility to sanctimonious prayers.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

No, my disagreement is with a cult that is very much alive and still hurting people

You are
coorect &#8212; there is nothing cunning about Alcohol &#8212; or baffeling and on the power
scale it is really hardly a substitue for many other flamables &#8212; But the DISEASE sir
&#8212; is all of that &#8212; the AMerican Medical Association says so and the ICD Code for it
is adequate for most insurance prividers and health care providers.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, alcohol is a very good fuel substitute. Ever heard of gasohol?
<p>
The A.M.A. statement that alcoholism is a disease was a political decision
in response to loud complaints from people like you.
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">It was not based on medical studies</a>.
<p>
I go with the decision of the American Psychiatric Association, which says
that there is no such disease. They recognize &quot;Alcohol Abuse&quot; and &quot;Alcohol
Dependency&quot; as mental disorders, but not &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
They wisely decided not to touch the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;, because it was too ill-defined.

<p>
Speaking of ill-defined, the condition that the A.M.A. recognized, and the &quot;spiritual
disease&quot; that Bill Wilson wrote about in the <i>Big Book</i>,
are not the same thing at all.
The A.M.A. did not recognize or agree with Bill Wilson's deluded ideas of
&quot;alcoholism&quot;.
The A.M.A. considers
alcoholism to be the chronic over-consumption of alcohol. Hence &quot;alcoholism&quot; is caused
by drinking too much alcohol. But that isn't what Bill Wilson wrote. He said that
alcohol consumption was just a &quot;symptom&quot; of an underlying sinful condition:
<p>
<a name="alcoholism_causes"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="#5f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

</ul>

<p>
That is not what the American Medical Association was talking about when they
called habitual alcohol over-consumption a disease.
So in that case, you and A.A. are using the propaganda trick called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#loaded" target="_blank"><i>Redefining Terms</i></a>.
You say that the A.M.A. has called &quot;alcoholism&quot; a 
disease, and then you quickly substitute an entirely different definition
of the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;, and try to imply that the A.M.A. agrees
with you, which it does not.

<p>
Furthermore, when the <i>Big Book</i> was first published, what the
good doctors at the A.M.A.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#AMA_review" target="_blank">actually said about it</a> was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The book under review is a curious combination of organizing propaganda and religious exhortation. It is in no sense a scientific
book, although it is introduced by a letter from a physician who claims to know some of the anonymous contributors who have
been &quot;cured&quot; of addiction to alcohol and have joined together in an organization which would save other addicts by a kind of
religious conversion.
<p>
The book contains instructions as to how to intrigue the alcoholic addict into the acceptance of divine guidance in place of
alcohol in terms strongly reminiscent of Dale Carnegie and the adherents of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">the Buchman (&quot;Oxford&quot;) movement</a>.
The one valid
thing in the book is the recognition of the seriousness of addiction to
alcohol. Other than this, the book has no scientific merit or interest.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The Journal of the American Medical Association, October 14, 1939.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So yes, I agree with those doctors, too.
<p>
And if you really want to know what the doctors say about alcoholism and A.A.,
then you should read the work of the doctors who actually put A.A. to the test, and
found it be be a complete failure as a way of treating alcoholism:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for public drunkenness
in a group of street drunks.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh</a>
found that A.A. just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
made them require more expensive hospitalization later.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a>
conducted the biggest and most expensive British test of Alcoholics Anonymous,
and found that having a doctor talk to alcoholics for just one hour,
telling them to quit drinking, was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A. meetings and a full-blown &quot;treatment program&quot;.
<li>
AA-Trustee Doctor George E. Vaillant (also Professor of Psychology
at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based
treatment program had the highest death rate</a>
of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Vaillant also admitted that his A.A.-based treatment program had a zero-percent success
rate, above normal spontaneous remission.
</ul>
<p>
So yes, by all means, let's listen to what the doctors say.
</font>
<p>

&quot;candyitest&quot;
though responsible for a tooth cavity here and there or maybe even a tummy ache,
surely has yet to kill anyone AS THIS DISEASE does on a minute by minute basis
eveywhere in the world, so because it is a disease &#8212; Persons who are degreed in
medicine say it is a disease and I have it &#8212; you sir are hardly qulaified to tell me
what it does to me symptomatically or  how I react to its various manifistations.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alcohol is much more poisonous than sugar, and kills far more people,
but that does not change the facts of the matter.
You are pointedly ignoring the simple fact that you cannot stop having a
real disease like cancer or tuberculosis just by abstaining from eating or
drinking
something, but you can most assuredly stop suffering from &quot;alcoholism&quot;
just by abstaining from drinking ethyl alcohol.
<p>
Getting sick from drinking too much alcohol really is a lot like getting
a belly-ache from eating too much ice cream and candy
(the dreaded &quot;spiritual disease of candyism&quot;).
There isn't really any such &quot;spiritual disease&quot; as candyism,
and there isn't really any such
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">spiritual disease</a>&quot;
as alcoholism.
In fact, there isn't any such thing as a
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">spiritual disease</a>&quot;
at all. The &quot;spiritual disease&quot; rap was just Bill Wilson's
insanity speaking again.

<p>
Drinking too much alcohol will make you sick, and then kill you.<br>
Stop drinking so much of it, and you will be a lot healthier.<br>
That just isn't a disease.
<p>
Drinking too much of Rev. Jim Jones' cyanide kool-aid will make you sick
and then kill you, too.<br>
Don't drink it and you will be a lot healthier.<br>
That doesn't mean that there is a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; called
&quot;cyanidism&quot;.
</font>
<p>

The disease is CUNNING &#8212; it is surley baffeling (look what it has done to you) and
Powerful ????

<p>
<font color="blue">
Diseases cannot be cunning. They do not have brains or minds.
You are drifting off into the world of fairy
tales and evil spirits and cunning devils again.
</font>

<p>
My god man &#8212; it costs this country MIllions &#8212; if not Billions, every single year.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alcohol and drug over-consumption and misuse costs this country a fortune, yes,
but that does not mean that alcohol over-consumption is a &quot;disease&quot; that
is &quot;cunning, baffling, and powerful.&quot;
That is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#non_sequitur" target="_blank"><i>non-sequitur</i></a> &#8212; broken logic.
</font>
<p>

As for your will power &#8212; Next time you get the flu &quot;will it away&quot;
&#8212; Hell &#8212; next time a woman shitcans your worthless ass &#8212; will her back &#8212; LOL

<p>
<font color="blue">
What is that strange remark supposed to mean? Having the flu and
drinking alcohol are not the same thing at all.<br>
Your attempt at an argument is downright illogical.
What brain-damaged sponsor taught you to say that one?<br>
Getting sick with the flu is not a voluntary act, but lifting a glass
of alcohol to your mouth and drinking it most assuredly is.
You cannot choose whether to get the flu, but you can choose whether to drink alcohol.<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Are you trying to claim that
we should not have or use will power to overcome addictions?
<p>
<li> Are you trying to claim that will power is useless in fighting against
addictions like alcohol dependency?
<p>
<li> Are you trying to claim that we are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;?
(That is Step One, of course.)
</ul>
<p>
If so, then that is a prime example of how Alcoholics Anonymous hurts
people by spreading crazy misinformation about recovery from addictions.
<p>
Will power is most assuredly a good thing &#8212; one of the most valuable assets
you can have while you are battling addictions &#8212; and smart recovery counselors
will do everything they can to increase their clients' will power.

<p>
And what is your solution to the problem? To not have any will power?
To declare that you are
&quot;powerless&quot; over your problems</a>,
and just beg &quot;Higher Power&quot; to solve all of your problems for you?
<p>
That doesn't work, you know.
That is just
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#narcissistic3" target="_blank">a foolish descent into
infantile narcissism</a>,
where people regress to acting like helpless babies and expect Big Mommy
or Big Daddy (&quot;Higher Power&quot;)
to take care of them and grant their wishes because they cry.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Step 1: We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.<br>
Step 3: Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.
</font>

<p>
Telling people not to rely on their will power, to declare themselves powerless over
alcohol and just give up and surrender
to some &quot;Higher Power&quot; (who might be &quot;God&quot; or might
be something else)
guarantees lots of relapses and failures.
Bill Wilson's program for sobriety is a crazy failure. Of course &#8212;
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was insane</a>,
and his &quot;spiritual cure for alcoholism&quot; was the
ravings of a lunatic.
</font>
<p>

&#8212; Good luck to you and
please by all means continue your attack on the most successful and beneficial
thing that has ever happened for addicted people since the start of time. Who knows
, you could even find your 15 minutes in here someday &#8212; LOL &#8212;

<p>
Good Day, Jerry

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>The most successful and beneficial thing that has ever happened since
the start of time?</i><br>
Now that's a really outrageous claim. Again, show me the evidence.
<p>
A.A. is great at making grandiose, exaggerated
claims of success, but those claims do not hold up when examined carefully.
Bill Wilson started the practice of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">exaggerating and
lying about the A.A. success rate</a>
way back in 1939, and A.A. is still doing it today.
But A.A. is still just a cult religion, not a cure for alcohol dependency,
and A.A. does not have any great success rate.

<p><br>
By the way, you have been noticeably silent about the
quote from Bill Wilson that you couldn't find:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font size="4" color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
I just checked the 1st, 2nd, 21st and 34th printings of the AA 12&amp;12 in
hardback, softback and gift editions and I can not find your referance to
Page 174...
Therefore I believe all of your statements to be inaccurate and false and all of
your &quot;research&quot; to be tainted.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Did you finally find the quote?<br>
So my research isn't so tainted after all, is it?

<p><br>
And what about
<a href="orange-Moonies000213.jpg" target="_blank">those big Moonies' conventions</a>?<br>
Do they prove that Reverend Moon is the messiah with all of the right
answers to everything? Do you imagine that they have fun with a
&quot;Count-Down to Heaven&quot; or whatever it is that
they do at their parties? Does all of that emotional hoopla prove that they are right
and have a guaranteed ticket to Heaven?
<p>
If not, then how does the emotional &quot;Countdown of Years of Sobriety&quot;
at A.A. conventions prove that the A.A. program works?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

[Tue, August 3, 2004, Jon P. wrote:]<br>
Subject: Thank you for the Orange Papers

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I have been reading your orange papers. My mother is an alcoholic who has
been sober (in the A.A. sense of the word) for 14 years. I sent her a link
to your page to which she responded, &quot;Thanks for thinking of me, and for
passing along the interesting reading.
It's always informative to get others' perspectives on things. There were
things in there that I believe are misrepresentations, and others that rang
true....&quot;. She sent this the DAY after she recived the link, so there is no
way she could possibly have read even just the hundreds of pages that I have
(and I am still not even halfway through it...).

<p>
My mother is a very intelligent woman, and I believe that her sobriety is
largely due to her mental strength, and not to her AA indoctrination. She
obviously feels differently, but how can you blame her? The cult worked for
her. She doesn't drink anymore, and 7 years after she stopped drinking, she
stopped smoking, too (which I had been nagging her to do since I was old
enough to talk; she didn't have a cult religion to help her stop that
though, so I guess that made it take a little longer...) She is, perhaps,
not as much of a critical thinker, or quite as skeptical as you or I, and
her success has made it easy for her to overlook any inconsistencies, lies,
or harmful effects of AA.

<p>
In reading one paragraph you wrote in the section on
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#example_vital" target="_blank">Propaganda and Debating techniques</a>,
it occurred to me that AA can very much be described like a virus.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Swiss,Sanserif,Courier">
&quot;The recruiter's convictions 'seem to have worked so well'? That may
well be a slick deception. The recruiter could be doing the 'Fake It Until
You Make It' routine. He may well relapse and die drunk after doing a bunch
of enthusiastic recruiting, just like Jackie did in the Big Book, and just
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Paddy" target="_blank">like Paddy did</a>,
and just like Bill Wilson's own recruiter, Ebby Thacher,
did.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It would seem that the &quot;Fake it 'til you make it&quot; part certainly
masks, for many people, their hopeless condition. The recruiter gets the &quot;AA
bug&quot; and begins to pass it along to all who will listen (and some who won't,
at first anyway), and it continues to spread, virally. This is one area
which my mother differed from your 'average' AA member. She had a sponsor,
and sponsored one or two people, but by and large she managed to stay the
hell away from forcing it on everyone she could lay her hands on.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jon,
<p>
Thanks for an interesting letter. I really agree about that &quot;virus&quot;
word. In fact, over on another web page,
the one on <a href="orange-religious_faith.html#werewolf" target="_blank" target="_blank">Religious Faith</a>,
I asked,
&quot;It's kind of like a virus, isn't it?
Or like getting bitten by a vampire or a werewolf...&quot;
</font>

<p>
Then again, she never ended up in a &quot;rehab&quot; situation, and really never was
one to drink to excess. I feel that she is not one of those people who would
&quot;drink themselves to death&quot;. She is more like how you describe yourself
&#8212; she
drank a lot, but not to the point of poisoning herself or making life
impossible, but she was out of control of her need for the alcohol.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I did get to the stage of poisoning myself and making life impossible.
My doctor said,
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
&quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;</i></font>
&#8212;And he wasn't joking.
<p>
Still, I know what you mean. Why do some people seem to keep it under control,
at least to some extent, and just snap out of it when
the doctor tells them something like that, and quit drinking and save
their own lives, while other people just stay in denial and insist that
they don't have a problem and they don't need to quit drinking, and go
on to kill themselves?

(And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the Harvard Medical School reports</a>
that the ratio of survivors to losers is about 50/50...)
<p>
I feel like I could save a few lives if I really knew what the big
underlying difference between those two groups is.
On page 58 of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson just called the losers people
who were
<i>&quot;constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves...
they seem to have been born that way&quot;</i>,
but I find that answer to be overly simplistic and inaccurate
&#8212; just an attempt to explain away the A.A. failures. Still, I'm at a loss to
explain the critical difference between the survivors and the losers.
I know some of it &#8212;
<ul>
<li> Some people are in a lot of pain, and are killing their
pain.
<li>
Some are mentally ill and are trying to self-medicate.
<li>
Some people can't feel right, so they are trying to feel better...
<li>
Some have mental or emotional problems and don't seem to be entirely in tune
with this reality.
<li>
Some seem to be so freaked out that they just can't face reality.
</ul>
But why does one person eventually just snap and get straight, while another
goes on to commit slow suicide?
</font>

<p>
One annoying thing that came of my mother's alcoholism has been its effect
on me. Luckily I don't have to remember being beaten by my drunken mother,
or having to pick her up from the drunk tank or anything quite so dramatic.
Unfortunately, her membership in AA did give ME a rather negative view of
alcohol IN GENERAL. She told me from a very young age that I was probably
genetically predisposed towards addiction and alcoholism. Hearing that over
and over again, and seeing how incapable she was of quitting drinking or
smoking, it obviously had a very strong effect on me. I was all but
straight-edge right up until I was already of legal drinking age. I was
afraid to even try a drink, for fear that I would end up an alcoholic (&quot;one
drink, one drunk&quot;). Then, once I did somehow manage to try it, I realized
that I am not, in fact, an alcoholic. I drink sometimes, and we have a
rather well-stocked bar in my apartment. I never find myself drinking to
excess (except that once or twice at a party, But that is far more the
exception than the rule). I drink socially, and hell, I sometimes even have
a drink when I am ALONE. But I am by no means out of control of it. I drink
if I want to drink, and if I don't, I don't. My mom's warnings were more
crippling than the results of me drinking: the reality of my being able to
handle drinking responsibly.

<p>
I've challenged my mom to explain to me both what she feels were
misrepresentations, and also what she thought was true in what little of
your writing that she did read. If she comes up with anything of interest,
I'll let you know. ;)

<p>
Thank you for all of the hard work you've put into these papers. It is
well-appreciated.

<table border="4" width="99%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Why did I quit drinking when I did? It finally came down to the simple fact that I
stopped being able to believe that alcohol was making me feel good. It had been a
firm belief. Even now I can hear the tsk'ing of those who KNEW that it didn't make
me feel better, it was a trick. I didn't care what they knew. I KNEW that it did. It
worked when nothing else in my experiences could.

<p>
I had finally drank enough that my body and mind couldn't get that good feeling from
it anymore. My belief had been strong that it was the magic for feeling good. And I
tried many times to make it continue to work. My belief was forced to change.
Nothing else, I still wanted that &quot;feel good&quot; magic. I didn't know if it was
possible to get it any other way. I never had any illusion that I was drinking to
solve my problems. I drank to get away and not become overwhelmed with them. And
that is real about alcohol, it can and will do this. Definitely not a good way but
it did work and it was an easy immediate solution. And that is why I drank. Because
it worked. For many years alcohol would allow me to feel I was invincible.

<p>
I can understand easily why I &quot;did the same thing over and over expecting different
results&quot; There was a time when I got different results. And I got those different
results for a very long time and developed the belief that this was how it worked.
&quot;It works if you work it&quot;. How true. It was work drinking alcoholically. And I was
willing to do all this work because it worked. When the results actually changed, my
belief came into jeopardy. The need to feel good was still there but I found myself
without the magic. It doesn't surprise me at all that I tried and tried to recapture
it.

<p>
I was completely devastated to find that alcohol wouldn't work. In shock. I had
nowhere to turn. Feeling good was essential. I could either continue drinking, not
even trying to feel good anymore or die. The only two solutions I felt or knew and
not even really two separate solutions because I knew that the drinking would kill
me, just take longer. This was my &quot;rock bottom&quot;. I was questioning my own will to
live if it had to be without alcohol. No, I hadn't just lost everything on the
outside like is supposed to happen. But I lost everything on the inside. Not because
I didn't think I could quit. But if I quit I would never feel good again, so what
was the point? Not feeling good sober or not feeling good drunk was the question.
And I didn't like either of those options.

<p>
I had never drank to kill myself. I had drank to feel better. I didn't hate myself.
Wanting to make myself feel better drinking was actually trying to care for my
well-being ironically. It was the only way I knew, the first way I found and since
it had seemed to work for such a long time I never had bothered to look for another
way. Redefine the problem. Not - I am an alcoholic. I am a person who doesn't know
how to make myself feel better without alcohol. The fact that this was one of my
basic needs proving that I liked myself. I had always believed that I deserved to
feel better. That is why the excuses and rationalizations were so easy to make
drinking. It made me feel better and I deserved that. But this relationship with
alcohol had changed. It is inevitable that if you put poison in your body long
enough, your body will be unable to deal with it anymore. Systems give up.

<p>
I had already decided that the answer was drinking death or suicide death. But, all
problems have more than one solution, more than one way of finding an answer. The
other answer was to live. Live without my &quot;feel good&quot; but live nonetheless. I
realized that my feel good was a &quot;happy&quot;. But not feeling good was not necessarily a
&quot;sad&quot;. It could be just an &quot;ok&quot;. So, since not drinking was not a &quot;sad&quot; I chose to
live.

<p>
My thoughts raced when I first quit (as they always did, but now they screamed and
demanded attention) - I WANT to be drunk. I WANT to feel good. I WANT and I WANT
NOW! Going to get drunk, only way. Silence. Rage. Getting drunk doesn't WORK
anymore! I STILL WANT. Something, anything. WANT, WANT, WANT. Repeating over and
over. Frustrating, enraging me because now I didn't know any other way to get that
feel good, to meet these demands.

<p>
But I wouldn't drink again. It simply could not/would not fill that WANT anymore. It
was that plain and simple. I didn't quit because I hated it or myself, because my
family hated it or me. I quit because I am selfish and alcohol couldn't give me what
I wanted anymore. My relationship with drinking had always been a give and take. I
would accept the bad as long as the good was there. The bad alone was just not an
option. I could feel &quot;ok&quot; without it and so that is what I did.

<p>
I felt ok. No, I didn't &quot;get it&quot; or have a revelation. I didn't find religion or
anything else to fill that want. I didn't &quot;have what they had&quot; or some mystical
peace and serenity. But I was ok. Not bad, not good, but ok.

<p>
The overwhelming first emotion for me to deal with was absolute and complete rage. I
had found a solution to make me feel better and it was gone now. I wanted to be able
to convince myself that I could still find it drinking. And I tried. I tried VERY
hard. I really didn't care if I was an alcoholic or not, I just wanted to make
myself believe that it would work again. But, I had already changed that belief from
experience and it wouldn't come back. And I hated everything. The world was mean to
me for taking this away and so I would be mean right back. I was no different from a
child throwing a temper tantrum.

<p>
Anger turned to frustration. I couldn't even be &quot;ok&quot; this angry. So what do I do
now? I didn't even care about feel good anymore. I was just working on &quot;ok&quot; again.
And frustration coupled with grief. I mourned. I cried. I missed my magic &quot;feel
good&quot;. It was gone forever. And I couldn't convince myself otherwise. So I finally
BELIEVED. And it was over. I couldn't remember ever missing anything so much in my
life.

<p>
I felt sorry for myself. Ok was the best I would ever have now. And I always had to
listen to all these thoughts that never stopped in my head. But I was ok again and
the thoughts were ok too. I started becoming used to the constant drone in my head.
And everything was ok.

<p>
I accepted that this was life now. So be it. I could live this way. I didn't need
that fairy tale happiness. I just WAS. Things that had been important to me before
became unimportant. I didn't care, everything was ok. I was going to accept.

<p>
I became ambivalent. I believed that it didn't matter what I did because feel good
was gone and unattainable now. I decided that people who didn't drink had just never
discovered feel good. That is why they couldn't understand it. They had never felt
it. We all just had to learn to live &quot;ok&quot;. This was perfectly acceptable to some it
seemed. They didn't care Why or How. They just were.

<p>
I tried to find things to occupy a mind that wouldn't shut up. I took care of my
family and house without thought. It filled time. It didn't take nearly as much time
as I had thought before. Going &quot;out&quot; was not an option. I didn't care about all
those other people. I knew that they were just going about life making it &quot;ok&quot; too.
They couldn't fill my want. They were trying to fill their own, if they even thought
about &quot;ok&quot; at all.  I felt alone and disconnected.

<p>
My mind was hungry. It wanted. And so I would have to come out of my apathy long
enough to feed it and get it to quiet down again. The internet became a way to fill
that need for new. I looked up anything and everything about alcohol. Someone else
may have learned something. I studied alcoholism and as many views on it as I could
find. I researched. I wanted to understand. I read even the views considered
outrageous. I wanted to find as much information as I could and I bombarded myself
with it. I wanted an answer.

<p>
<a name="solution11"> </a>
I found WFS. I read posts. I read their program. I analyzed feelings shared. I tried
to see what if anything I could believe. I did this for several days without wanting
to become a part of it. Just the word &quot;program&quot; left a bad taste in my mouth. The
statements scared me. I didn't want to brainwash myself or have someone else make my
decisions about me. I had always laughed about our self-help culture these days.
Everyone trying to get better than that &quot;ok&quot;. How could someone else tell me what
was going to work for me? Why would I listen? I never listened to anyone without
questioning and comparing to what I already believed. This is the part of my story
where I am supposed to &quot;see the light&quot;. But I didn't. I was supposed to know that
these women had a secret answer and if I wanted it I would have to listen.

<p>
But WFS didn't try to tell me the &quot;answer&quot;. It told me that I had to find it. And
that it was all about me and what I knew and chose. And that one way was not the
only way. Thinking was good and necessary. You didn't have to go mindlessly with the
flock to not drink. YOU knew yourself and what you needed to do. It was a program to
learn how to recognize this and use it. I was surprised at the insight and
intelligence that these women had. They didn't try to tell me that I would get &quot;it&quot;
and that I would become like &quot;them&quot;. They told me that I would learn what I needed
to and I would become me, I would grow. I felt a connection. I believed this. I
submerged myself in this comfort and safety of women. The whole world was NOT what I
had thought and different than me. There was honest compassion. There was
acceptance, not about working a program, but about staying sober and being strong
enough to do whatever you had to do to maintain it. Accepting these women was easy.
We had all been
there. Different stories, different reasons, different outcomes maybe but we had
all felt this intensity. We had all been through some raging internal debate. I
started feeling better than ok. I could help and be helped.

<p>
And my feel good? WFS makes me feel good because it feeds my mind with positives,
with mostly things that I already know and just bury under too many negatives. And
it makes me feel good knowing that something I may say could help someone else. Not
because their mind is the same as mine, but sharing experiences can lead to valuable
insight. None of us really knows the be all, end all answers. Because there isn't
just one, but we can certainly help others to find out what they believe will work
for them. And amazingly enough, sometimes some of us find it. And that is more than
&quot;ok&quot;. That is really &quot;feel good&quot;.

<p>
Hi there--

<p>
I'm a long-time member of AA, and also a fairly voracious reader.  I just finished
reading
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Cheever" target="_blank">Cheever's book</a>,
and my impression of it was that she did gloss over most of
the stuff that would be fairly embarassing to Bill.  Surfing arund the web, I found
the orange papers and have enjoyed browsing through them.  I can imagine that most
AA people might be upset by what you say, but I happen to think that the sooner we
get down to basics, the better, and that includes letting go of the idea that the
co-founders were great spititual authorities.

<p>
A question:  you quote Carolyn See, who says that her mother, &quot;Wynn C. [Corum]&quot; was
one of Bill's mistresses.  Is the &quot;Wynn&quot; just coincidental between Helen Wynn and
Wynn C.? Or were they related somehow?

<p>
Thanks for what you're doing &#8212; if AA survives the truth it'll be better
for it.  If not, then we'll be better without AA.

Best,<br>

The naming of

They were definitely very different women. Carolyn See printed a photograph

Subject A.A.

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
A couple of months ago I was gifted a book titled &quot;You are being lied to.&quot; One of
the articles was on A.A. Full of indignation I went on a web search to confirm or
refute the accusations and I came across your site. I read the lot last week and I
am still reeling from the shock (and euphoria) of the revelations. Talk about a
spiritual experience! It was a repeat of the intense relief induced by &quot;you are no
longer alone&quot; which I last experienced joining A.A. in 1979.

<p>
I was a 99% brainwashed member of this cult and have even made the &quot;pilgrimage&quot; to
Akron, Ohio and more or less accepted the Deification of Bill W. and Dr. Bob! Oh
boy, I can now see how religions started up in the distant past.

<p>
When I joined A.A. here in Glasgow, Scotland, it had its own local brand of format
and recovery program. (Same today at &quot;ordinary&quot; meetings &#8212; more later.) Meetings were
held between 8pm and 10 pm: There was no paraphernalia on the &quot;top table&quot; or on the
walls: monetary contributions were frowned on, the group members would pay the rent
and supply refreshments: the Preamble was read out and a guest &quot;speaker&quot; (anyone
with 90+ days sobriety) had 1 hour to share his/her &quot;experience, strength and hope&quot;:
then 1 hour of &quot;round the room&quot; comments: talk of God was almost taboo, probably as
a result of the festering Catholic/Protestant divide in the City: outside of
meetings, 'phone calls and home visits were frequent and supportive.
After I was a few weeks in A.A., a member sitting next to me gave me a smile and a
wink and slipped me a crumpled, poorly photocopied piece of paper. I haven't
actually looked at it for 25 years but I still have it in my A.A. archive and here
it is. (Words in capitals are original and were very much the slogans of the day.)

<p>
<center>
<table width="94%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" border="4">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

HOW IT WORKS

<p>
Recognise that it is the FIRST DRINK which does the damage. The FIRST DRINK you take
sets up a powerful physical craving which leads to the second, the third and so on
until you are drunk. Avoidance of the FIRST DRINK means that you cannot get drunk.

<p>
The following steps are suggested as a programme of recovery:-

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. Stay away from the FIRST DRINK for ONE DAY AT A TIME. If a day is too long then
break it down to half a day or even an hour if necessary. If the compulsion to drink
is overwhelming, contact an A.A. member. Remember, LIFT THE PHONE BEFORE YOU LIFT
THE DRINK.
<li>
2.  At first, attend as many A.A. meetings as is practically possible. DO NOT JUDGE
A.A. ON THE BASIS OF A FEW MEETINGS.
<li>
3.  Whilst at a meeting, try hard to look for the SIMILARITIES between the speaker's
experiences and your own. Try to keep an open mind and put aside any differences
between the speaker's experiences and your own.
<li>
4.  As a result of these similarities, make up your own mind whether or not your
life is unmanageable through drinking and whether or not you are an alcoholic. If
the answer is yes, ADMIT AND ACCEPT THAT YOU ARE AN ALCOHOLIC. Remember, BE HONEST
WITH YOUR DRINKING.
<li>
5.  Build your sobriety on the solid foundation of this ADMISSION and ACCEPTANCE and
remind yourself on a daily basis.
<li>
6.  Join an A.A. Group of your liking and GET INVOLVED in Group activities. As time
goes by you may go to fewer meetings or stop going to meetings altogether but
remember, IF EVERYBODY STOPPED GOING TO MEETINGS, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A FIRST
MEETING.
<li>
7.  If possible, avoid having alcohol in your home, stay out of pubs and clubs, and
STAY IN SOBER COMPANY.
<li>
8.  If anything in A.A. confuses you, for example talk of a higher power, PUT IT
ASIDE FOR THE MEANTIME. Take only from A.A. what you need today, recovery is
progressive. Remember, ALWAYS PLAY FOR TIME.
<li>
9.  No matter how bad your thoughts, feelings or circumstances get in your sobriety,
remember, A DRINK WILL ALWAYS MAKE IT WORSE.
<li>
10.  Practise living your life in the present. Utilise the lessons of the past and
make plans for the future but do not live in the past or the future, remember, LIVE
IN THE NOW.
<li>
11.  Try not to keep a problem to yourself. Try to confide and share your problem
with another A.A. member but be very careful who you choose, preferably someone of
your own gender and background. Remember, A PROBLEM SHARED IS A PROBLEM HALVED.
<li>
12.  Take your newfound sobriety and contentment into your home. Your first priority
is to make amends to those nearest and dearest. Remember, true recovery is best
recognised in the home.
</ul>

<p>
Finally, A.A. also stands for ALTERED ATTITUDES. You may find that some of your
attitudes and behaviour will have to change if you are to stay sober. Listen
carefully for similarities in the speaker's story and take advice from his/her
attitude changes in recovery.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Not toooo bad, Eh? I have no idea as to the origin of this document but reading it
again, it certainly encapsulates the A.A. philosophy in Glasgow at the time. In
addition there were frequent verbal warnings, not stated publicly, but whispered
privately, &quot;don't read the Big Book &#8212; it'll screw up your head&quot;, and the more
forceful, &quot;don't read the Big Book &#8212; it'll get you drunk.&quot;
Well, well, well, a week ago I would have utterly condemned this as
heretical...... not now!
<p>
Being an avid reader, I did read the Big Book (and every other A.A. and Hazledean
publication) and they had no particular influence, a bit yank, but at the time just
jolly good reads and forgotten.
<p>
I then had a 10 year &quot;pink cloud&quot; in which I attended about 1 meeting a week,
regularly doing &quot;12th step&quot;, ansaphone and public information stints. I made good
&quot;friends&quot; in A.A., it was my social circle. I worked no recovery program as such,
the desire to drink had been completely removed.
<p>
Then in 1990 I picked up a drink from a passing waiter at a social function and &#8212;
cut a long story short &#8212; the results were dire, unbelievably dire. I got back to
A.A. later that year and met an old pal I hadn't seen for years because he was going
to the new-fangled &quot;step&quot; meetings. I had known that these were springing up in the
1980's but never paid much attention. He told me that, unless I went to &quot;step&quot;
meetings and did the twelve steps, I had no hope and would die of drink: stopping
going to meetings would result in the same fate. I was truly desperate and if he had
asked me to believe that the moon was made of green cheese I would have given it my
best shot.

<p>
(At this point can I say that presently there is a virtual schism in Scottish A.A.
The original meetings are contemptuously known as &quot;bread and butter&quot; or
&quot;drinkalogue&quot; meetings and the burgeoning &quot;step&quot;, &quot;12 by 12&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, &quot;audio tape&quot;,
&quot;big book&quot;, &quot;discussion&quot; meetings are known as &quot;holy roller&quot; or &quot;airy fairy&quot;
meetings.
<p>
Kinder descriptions are &quot;third tradition&quot; meetings and &quot;recovery&quot; meetings but the
point is that the militant adherents of one condemn and don't attend the other &#8212; so
much for A.A. unity! Also the &quot;Cult&quot; is taking over from the &quot;Fellowship&quot; as
old-timers die out.)

<p>
I plunged into the twelve steps, got a sponsor (whom I now know to be a dangerous
freak) and, being an agnostic got a higher power (the Masonic G.A.O.T.U. or good old
mother nature). However, the bullshit bells really jangling but after a couple of
years of desperate perseverance they reduced to an occasional tinkle and &#8212; cut
another long story short &#8212; I turned into the typical Guru so well described in your
essays! I am now squirming in my chair when I think of the utter drivel I have
preached to unfortunate newcomers and fragile sponsees in the last 10 years.
(However, none are dead, 3 are back on the bottle, 8 are still sober of whom 5 don't
attend meetings.)

<p>
Some of the things I should have noted but through naivety and brainwashing &#8212; didn't
(until now)

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. Recidivism rates were and are pretty bad: I was, however, firmly convinced that
A.A. was a 100% cure.
<li>
2. The distorted logic that claims all sober members are due to A.A. but those who
drank again, it was their own fault.
<li>
3.  There are virtually no professional people in A.A. although I have seen dozens
attend a few meetings, never to be seen again.
<li>
4.  The awe and status awarded solely for length of continuous sobriety, even though
the holder is a warped, twisted old fart. (I suffered years of angst over my &quot;slip&quot;,
I too could have been an elder statesman!!)
<li>
5.  When I hit the bottle again, none of my &quot;close-knit, real, real friends&quot; wanted
anything to do with me. (Well, one did briefly.) Up to then, for years the doorbell
and the 'phone had never stopped. I remember when I wasn't too drunk, pleading with
them to come round for a chat but the stock reply was, &quot;there is nothing I can do
for you until you stop drinking&quot;. Bastards. (Subsequently I have done the same
thing. Bastard.)
<li>
6.  After my bender, my many years of previous sobriety (hailed at &quot;birthdays&quot; as a
wonderful achievement) counted for naff all. I was back in A.A. about 10 weeks and
asked to do a &quot;top table&quot;. The person who asked me was reprimanded because I hadn't
done my 90 days!
<li>
7.  I often met or heard of people who had not attended meetings for years and were
still sober, but I was convinced that stopping meetings was fatal.
<li>
8. Typical &quot;recovery&quot; meeting &#8212; a description. I am really squirming in my chair
again. The &quot;top table&quot; (altar?) is draped in a velvet embroidered tapestry with the
circle/triangle icon, the group name and some slogans or a prayer.

The table top has
the Big Book and the 12 by 12 book upright, framed serenity prayer, framed portraits

praying hands, framed 3rd step prayer, framed prayer of St Francis of Assisi, and
the painting of Bill and Bob sitting with No. 3 in Hospital.

Behind the table are
hung two huge wall charts with the steps and the traditions. (traditions are
curiously seldom discussed). The walls are festooned with prayers, poems, apocryphal
texts and loads of slogans. The guest speaker is from an approved elite (I am one)
and a few other Gurus dominate the discussion proceedings. (I cringe... These guys I
hung out with and really admired... well-meaning buffoons like me.... I was proud to
be part of the &quot;heavy squad&quot;.) The pseudo-religious yukspeak, the half-baked
theories, the mundane confessions, the blatant hypocrisy, the feigned sincerity... I
see it all now. Also the vast majority of the members at these meetings (often all
except me) are Roman Catholic, (The local population is 20% R.C.), I have no idea
why. And until last week I never saw A.A. as a religious cult! How the hell was all
this introduced into Scotland in the 1980's? We now have one of these 12 step
clinics in southern Scotland staffed by A.A. members and taking &quot;clients&quot; at $3000 a
week from Britain, Holland and Germany. They are bussed to A.A. meetings in the
locality and this is causing a lot of controversy.
</ul>

<p>
However, the 1% of my brain not washed exploded as I read your pages and I am elated
&#8212; &quot;The truth shall set you free&quot; &#8212; Bloody right!

<p>
You have done a good job debunking A.A. and this brings me to my final thought &#8212;
Nihilism. It makes me very uncomfortable to have nothing to believe in. Good factual
researchers like you have thoroughly debunked many people, organisations,
institutions and theories. In the last 15 years or so I have read many such examples
and here is my list.<br>
The British Monarchy<br>
The Scottish National party<br>
The New Labour party<br>
The Conservative party<br>
The British National party<br>
The Republican party<br>
The Democrat party<br>
Tony Blair<br>
Winston Churchill<br>
Harold Wilson<br>
William Gladstone<br>
Margaret Thatcher<br>
Abraham Lincoln<br>
George W. Bush<br>
Albert Einstein<br>
Isaac Newton<br>
Bill Wilson (A.A.)<br>
Doctor Spock<br>
Freemasonry<br>
Christianity<br>
Islam<br>
The Roman Empire<br>
The British Empire<br>
Western Civilisation<br>
Capitalism<br>
Socialism<br>
Republicanism<br>
The Highland clearances<br>
The European Union<br>
The invasion of Iraq<br>
Creation<br>
Evolution<br>
The big bang theory<br>
Nature/Nurture (The blank slate)<br>
Alcoholics Anonymous<br>
And many more I can't remember and scores more I haven't read.<br>
In addition, hidden camera documentaries have recently exposed racism, bribery and
corruption in our police, prison service, army, probation service, multinational
companies, hospital administration, social services and stock exchange.

<p>
You get my drift? Nothing left to believe in. However it is possible to vote for the
best of a bad lot although my allegiances are wearing a bit thin! So I will continue
to attend &quot;bread and butter&quot; meetings in the spirit of the unofficial 6th step.

Hi Gordon,
<p>
Wow. Thanks for a great letter. It's fascinating to hear from the other
side of the ocean, to hear what is going on over there. And thanks for all
of the compliments.
<p>
<a name="hummingbird"> </a>
About the nihilism thing, and nothing to believe in, I have some thoughts
on that:

<p>
Just by coincidence, this last week has been emotional and dramatic
for me. Last Sunday evening, a week ago, I was going for a walk downtown with
a friend, just because it was a beautiful warm dry evening after a blazing
hot summer day. We saw a dead bird on the sidewalk, a brilliantly colored
little thing. My friend looked at it and sadly said, &quot;Awww...&quot;
<p>
It was a hummingbird, a shiny irridescent metallic green little hummingbird.
At first, I thought it was
dead. It was just laying there on the ground on its back, with its feet up
in the air, in the classic death pose. But then I noticed that its little feet were
twitching, and it was clawing at the air. I picked it up and looked at it.
Its right eye was caked open and it looked very dehydrated and exhausted,
but it was alive, and sort of looking out of its other eye.
I carried it to the nearest water fountain and stuck its
tiny beak into the water stream and it immediately started drinking, its
little white tongue darting in and out rapidly.
<p>
My guess is that it got lost downtown on a very hot summer day, and couldn't
find flowers or water, so it collapsed from dehydration, hunger, and heat
exhaustion.
<p>
We were on our way to a supermarket, so I took it with me, and stopped at
every water fountain along the way and gave it another drink.
Inside the supermarket there was a
Starbucks coffee stand. I asked the guy there for a little sugar-water
solution for the thing, and he mixed up a tiny cup for the bird, free.
<p>
I carried it home.  All of that time, it didn't do anything. It was so sick
and out of it that it couldn't even lift its head or roll over or get up on
its feet. I just put the tip of its beak into the cup of sugar-water every
so often so it could drink.
But just as I entered my place, it jumped out of my hand and flew
about 6 or 8 feet before it crashed. It was starting to recover, but didn't
have much strength.
<p>
I put it into a plastic tub with a thin towel over the top to keep it in
(the only cage I had handy), and
fed it a bunch of honey-water solution with a &quot;baby's eyedropper&quot;. (Really,
it wasn't an eye-dropper; more like a feeding tool for putting a
tablespoon of medicine or something into a baby's mouth. It worked great
as a hummingbird feeder.)
<p>

With each passing hour it woke up a little more
and got itself more together, although it was still a mess and very weak.
<p>
The next morning, it escaped while I was feeding it, and it flew around the room
for 15 or 20 seconds before it ran out of energy and crashed.
It was getting better, but still had a long way to go.
<p>
My friend talked me into taking it to the Audubon Society,
but we couldn't actually get to them and they don't pick up, so they
just gave us instructions over the telephone on how to care for it,
and also gave us the name
of a local veterinarian who worked with them. We took it there.
<p>
That vet was great and gave me lots of helpful advice. She said that it
was an immature female &quot;Anna's Hummingbird&quot;, and recovering nicely.
But nobody else had
the time or inclination to hand-care for it 'round the clock, so I ended
up taking it back home and caring for it myself, per their instructions.
I took a cardboard box and stood it on end and covered the front with
a thin net garment that a girl loaned me. It made a passable cage, and gave
the bird room to fly around in, although it was still so goofy in the head
that it was bouncing off of the walls. I continued hand-feeding it because it
was too out of it to feed itself.
<p>
Well, it got better. With each passing hour it grew stronger and more coordinated.
In the evening, its head suddenly cleared a lot, and it stopped bouncing off of the
walls and acting goofy.
It started flying precisely and making crisp, controlled maneuvers,
and was able to hover and feed itself out of my home-made hummingbird feeder.
And it fed like every five minutes. The appetite on those things is unreal.
And then it spent all of its spare time trying to escape from the cage.
<p>
The next morning it was even better, so I decided to follow the veterinarian's
instructions and release it. She said that hummingbirds do not survive at all
well in captivity, and that the longer one is kept in captivity, the more
likely it is to die, so the best thing to do is restore them to health quickly
and then release them. I took it up into the hills where there
is a giant rose garden and let it go. It seemed to be just fine as it buzzed around
and then disappeared into the distance.
<p>
I immediately missed it. It was a real kick having such a beautiful little
thing around; it was a real kick bringing it back to life;
and it left a void when it was gone. I was surprised at how much I could care
about a little bird that I only had for about 40 hours total.
Those things are magical.
<p>
Okay, so what does any of that have to do with anything?

<p>
I had some very funny thoughts during that experience. It occurred to me
that I was, to that little bird, perhaps a &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
to borrow an obvious phrase from A.A..
I was a giant being who just appeared out of nowhere
and saved it when it was dying.  I had the power to keep it
from dying, but I was not omnipotent or all-powerful, and what I could do for it was
actually very limited, but it was enough.
I could give it a few days of help while it recovered, but beyond that
I couldn't guarantee that it will live for years or live happily ever after.
<p>
I don't know what the bird thinks of me, if it even thinks of me at all.
Does it think of me as a benevolent being who helped it,
or the monster who kept it locked up in a little cage for two days?
Who knows...
<p>
<a name="starfish"> </a>
The real underlying question is &quot;Why? Why bother helping the hummingbird?
Why should I care?&quot;
<p>
I am reminded of a story that I think was written by a biologist named
Loren Eisley. He described how a big storm over the ocean had caused
a storm surge that washed a lot of starfish up onto the beach, out of the
water. Those starfish were in big trouble. Starfish crawl around on little
tube feet which work by the starfish pumping water through them.
In the air, a starfish is helpless and can't move its feet at all (no water
to pump), and it can't crawl back into the water.
Those starfish on the beach were doomed.
<p>
But along came a man who was whiling away his time by
walking down the beach, picking up the starfish
and throwing them like Frisbees back out into the ocean, where they would live.
Mile after mile of beach, the guy just picked up the starfish and threw them
back into the ocean.
<p>
Eisley asked himself why the guy was doing that. From the viewpoint of a
biologist, such behavior would seem pointless. It didn't get the guy any more
food, or money, or sex, or anything. He did not get a single material benefit
from tossing the helpless starfish back into the ocean.
<p>
No, his motivation had to come from a higher dimension than just material
survival. Perhaps he did it because he loved life,
or he loved the ocean, or he loved beautiful
creatures. Perhaps he did it because he felt compassion, and he felt
something for the doomed little creatures. Whatever it was that moved him,
it reveals that there is something more to this universe than just
the low, crude hard job of animal survival. Living beings are capable of
caring for something more than just themselves or their own kind.
There are such things as
love and joy and compassion in this world, and although they seem to be in
very short supply, they are
hardwired into the very fabric of this universe, and are just part of it.
<p>
So something to believe in? Yes, I have something. I believe that this is
essentially a good universe, with some higher qualities,
even if it often seems pretty grim.
There really is something that we might call spirituality, although it
is subtle and often hard to see. (Well of course. That's why they call
it &quot;spirit&quot;.)
<p>
It's easy to see how you could become disillusioned with the entities on
your list of organizations that have disappointed you. I don't believe in
them either. They aren't holy or perfect or even necessarily good or wise.
They are just organizations made by men, and they are often corrupt.
Or they are men who are far less than perfect, and often corrupt.
<p>
But there is still goodness and love in this universe.
<p>
It seems to me that one of the biggest challenges in this life is to
keep the love and joy alive, even in the face of quite justifiable
cynicism and bitterness.
And the challenge is to stay good even when all of those around you don't
seem to think it worth the bother. And for us Americans, the challenge is
to remain good and pursue the highest ideals even while we have a pretender
to the throne, George W. Bush, who seems to be the very embodiment of evil.
I care for sick hummingbirds while he drops bombs on children and blows their
brains out.
It's an interesting life.
<p>
Maybe we should believe in ourselves rather than in those institutions
that have disappointed us. And then we should work on ourselves to make ourselves
into something that is worth believing in...
<p>

Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject re: your site

<p>
Hello Agent Orange.

<p>
i like your website/book.  i am a graduate of over 16 rehabs at only 19 years old
(total 2 years of in-time).  ex-heroin and crack addict and what-have-you.  anyway,
while at rehab i was forced to go to twelve step meetings and found they were only
effective if you wanted to meet fucked up chicks.  anyway i found the meetings
excruciating.. all of these self-fulfilling, embarassingly opaque bromides spouted
like gospel at frequent intervals..  i just couldnt let myself go to the point where
i could allow that kind of bullshit to make sense to me and i cringed when i thought
of the type of idiotically duped personality who would feel enlightened or connected
when hearing such drivel.  so i havent been to any meetings in two years.. and havent
relapsed since i stopped going (i would relapse frequently when attending).. i now
have a good job, whereas i used to live under a bridge by a canal.

<p>
my suggestion for you is that you should condense the most
important/poignant/shocking elements of your book and convert them into easily
digestible bites conforming to user-friendly document shaping guidlines (i.e.
diamond shaped text blocks, paragraph breaks between unrelated sections) and display
links to them prominently at the top of your webpage.  even though the content is
scintillating it is off-putting to be presented with so much information and links
on one page.  then separately allow people to download the text of the entire book
or browse it online, as i dont think the internet is a good medium over which to
read things in book format.  and if the user, unfamiliar with the layout of the
books and unable to glean enough information from the text of a link about the
information it points to, the content of the site will be spread too thinly and
important information will be overlooked by the majority of people who are browsing.

<p>
thanks,<br>

Hi Moe,
<p>
Congratulations on your successes, and thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
As far as condensed statements go, three pages come to mind.
Check these out:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-secrets.html">The Twelve Biggest Secrets of A.A.</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-aalies.html">The Twelve Biggest Lies of A.A.</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-not_good.html">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>
</ol>
Perhaps you will find something there that suits your purposes.
I'll have to think about doing some more that are even more condensed.
<p>
Oh, and I do recommend that people download the entire web site in
archive file format
(<a href="index.html#archives" target="_blank">ZIP or .tar.gz</a>), so that they can read it offline
at their leisure. They can even burn it into home-made CDs.
I like staying with the HTML format because of all of the hyper-text
links from one thing to another, so they still need a computer, but they
can read the thing with a notebook computer while laying under a tree.
<p>
Enjoy, and have a good day.
