Subject: Quick Question<br>

<p>
At first, I respected A.A. But now, after I have seen the evidence, I agree
it is most definitely a cult.

<p>
Where should people go for alcoholic recovery?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Duncan,
<p>
Thanks for the question. And the first answer is another question:
<p>
Who says that you have to go anywhere?
<p>
Bill Wilson and A.A. have been repeating these myths for 70 years now:
<ul>
<p><li> Nobody can do it alone 
<p><li> You need a support group.
<p><li> If you don't go to a lot of meetings, then you are isolating.
</ul>

<p>
There is no truth to any of that.  The benefits of going to meetings are minimal, if
not non-existent.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#NIAAA_NES" target="_blank">The NIAAA reported</a>
that 75% of the people who successfully quit self-destructive
drinking did it alone, without any treatment or group.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Medical School</a>
reported 80%.

<p>
Nevertheless, if you wish to go to meetings and get some emotional support from others,
or learn something from others, you have plenty of choices like SMART, SOS,
or Lifering. (Admittedly, going to those meetings is far more likely to benefit
you than going to 12-Step meetings.) The whole list is here:

Subject: RE: Reply from Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Thanks Orange.
<p>
So we agree that the actual revenue to AA HQ is small potatoes of around
$10M/year
<p>
I guess I am surprised to hear that the Recovery Industry is $20B/year!
<p>
And even more surprised to hear that 75% of those purveyors are selling
AA/God based 12-step (I assumed that they had 'step' programs that were not
God, plus self/ego-decimation, plus lifelong-dependence-on-program). I would
imagine that is because AA is a lowest common denominator approach, free,
and readily available to piggy-back ontop of.
<p>
My own observation is that AA can be dangerous to newcomers who are victims
of abuse and fell into addiction as a maladaptive way to deal with stress or
insecurity. I see it as dangerous for those types of folks (as opposed to
ego maniacs like Bill Wilson) because those folks need support of the self
rather than destruction&amp;rebirth of the self. However, I do see people who
are a combination of addict-types (e.g. you can start off as an abuse-victim
and become an ego maniac).
<p>
I do know one old-timer who insists on outside help for newcomers she meets
who fall into the category of previous-victim &#8212; it is quite good/responsible
that she does this &#8212; too bad so few other old-timers do this.
<p>
And I also know some old timers who are a bit more broad-minded, smart,
deep, esoteric, etc. Too few, but at least some.
<p>
I do think the program is better than nothing for allot of folks &#8212; the
simpler the person, the better. Basically, those who have their first
experiences of deep self-awareness as a result of AA are the ones who get
the most out of it, and it can be net-good if the person is not a prior
victim of trauma.
<p>
Many of the smarter folks I meet are A-types who are driven by insecurities.
Some are slaves to their insecurities, some know they run on such thoughts
and harness them, but like a wild horse, they can be a great mount but they
can get out of the barn every once in a while too.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, JJB,
<p>
Thanks for the reply.
<p>
And yes, the numbers of dollars wasted on &quot;recovery&quot; and quack &quot;treatment&quot; are collosal.
By the way, that number comes from the 
Institute for Behavioral Research, Athens, Georgia, which is connected to the University
of Georgia.  Paul Roman and Terry Blum
did the <i>National Treatment Center Study Report</i> in 1996,
and they found that 93.1% of all treatment centers in the U.S.A. used
the 12-Step approach to treating alcoholism and drug addictions.
But when they repeated the survey in 2005, they found that only 75% of the treatment
centers used the 12-Step method.
(<a href="orange-letters217.html#NTCS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
That is a large change.
A lot of treatment centers have abandoned the 12-Step approach because it doesn't work.
People are waking up.
But the progress is coming with glacial slowness. Seventy-five percent of all
drug-and-alcohol treatment being quackery is a national disgrace.
<p>
I totally agree that lots of people do not need the &quot;destruction&amp;rebirth
of the self&quot; routine of A.A. for their recovery. In fact, that can be very
harmful. It can even drive sensitive people like Robin Williams to suicide.

<p>
<a name="Lowen"> </a>
By the way, this line:
<font color="black">&quot;start off as an abuse-victim and become an ego maniac&quot;</font>
is a textbook description of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
(And that is what Bill Wilson suffered from.) This book described it well:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alexander Lowen, M.D.<br>
Macmillan Publishing Comany, New York, 1983, and<br>
Collier Macmillan Publishers, London, 1983.<br>
ISBN: 0-02-575890-X<br>
LC: RC553.N36L38 1983<br>
LCCN: 83-18794<br>
<p>
This is a great book, a real classic. Dr. Lowen advances the idea that
narcissism is not falling in love with one's self, but rather with a
false image of one's self. That small subtle difference actually makes
a very large difference. In the original Greek mythology, Narcissus died
&#8212; starved to death &#8212; because he was obsessed with his own image and
stared at it endlessly.
But as Narcissus approached death, his real emaciated appearance could not have
been very attractive. Narcissus was seeing an illusion, not his true
appearance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Lowen advances the idea that narcissism is often caused
by child abuse and prolonged humiliation and pain in childhood. The child
adopts a persona where he feels no pain and is powerful and invulnerable.
The child thinks, <i>&quot;When I grow up, I'll be so powerful and strong that no
one can hurt me or humiliate me ever again.&quot;</i> Then the child, who grows into
adulthood, spends the rest of his life pursuing and defending an illusion.
Narcissists are obsessed with defending and preserving their image &#8212; they can't
stand it if somebody &quot;makes them look bad&quot; &#8212; they can't stand criticism.
They deny their true feelings and put on a mask of unfeeling, because
they imagine that it will keep them from being hurt again.
Likewise, they completely disregard other people's feelings.
They are obsessed with power and control, so that they can
control the world around them and prevent anyone from humiliating
them again.
Narcissists are often extremely seductive and manipulative people, often charismatic
charmers, and occasionally high achievers as well.
They lie habitually, without giving it a second thought.
They fear insanity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, Dr. Lowen was describing
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Bill Wilson</a>, the
abused son of an alcoholic father and a neurotic mother.<br>
</font>

This is great:

</font>

<p>
Alas, it's so unusual that this is the first time that I've ever heard of a Stepper sponsor
doing it.  But yes, it's the right thing to do.

<p>
About this:
<p>

</font>

<p>
Yes. I have <a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">the Newcomers Rescue League</a>,
which is an honorary organization of sane, wise, good-hearted people who attend A.A.
meetings to save the newcomers from bad sponsors.  But there are not nearly enough members
to save all of the newcomers.

<p>
I really wonder about this: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I do think the program is better than nothing for allot of folks
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
When Dr. George E. Vaillant, who just loved A.A. and went on to become a member of the
Board of Trustees of A.A. World Services, Inc., tried to prove that A.A. works, he
accidentally proved that A.A. kills.  He spent 8 years tracking his first 100 A.A.-treated
patients. At the end of 8 years, the score was 5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66
still drinking.  But A.A. couldn't even take the credit for those 5 sober people because
5% per year is the normal spontaneous recovery rate of untreated alcoholics.
Dr. Vaillant wrote: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After initial discharge, only five
patients in the [A.A.] Clinic sample <i>never</i> relapsed to alcoholic drinking,
and there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease.<br>
...<br>
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
...<br>
Once again, our results were no better than the natural history of the disorder.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i>, George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1983, pages 283-286.<br>

The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;The natural history of the disorder&quot; means &quot;what happens to
untreated alcoholics.&quot; So A.A. scored no better than &quot;no treatment&quot;.
But A.A. had the highest death rate of any way of treating alcohol abuse that  Dr. Vaillant
studied.


<p>
So there is no reason to believe that &quot;some people&quot; are helped by A.A.
The results of careful controlled studies say otherwise.
<p>
And when you think about it, it makes sense. Teaching people that they are powerless
over alcohol is a self-fulfilling prediction that doesn't end well.
Making people wallow in guilt for years depresses them, and make them relapse or
commit suicide, or both.
It sure would be nice if A.A. worked and helped some people, but the success rate just
isn't there.
<p>
Have a good day now.

To: &lt;info...&gt;<br>

<p>
Hi

<p>
I am an abbid reader of history.<br>
Here is a timeline on the connection between Ford and Hitler.

<p>
Nov 28th 1918- only 17 days after wars end the communists pounce in Berlin,
like dogs, using the instability the war has caused. Rosa Luxemburg the
leader of the &quot;spartacus league&quot; storms Berlin in an armed take over. In a
coordinated strike Kurt Eisner leads a mob and they take over Munich.

<p>
The German people are panic stricken fearful another soviet state will be
set up in Germany.

<p>
Feb 6th 1919- World war 1 vets form the freikorps and march into Berlin,
after fierce street to street fighting Luxemburg is finally rooted out,
shot, then thrown in the river, to the rejoicing of the people of Berlin.

<p>
2nd April 1919- Kurt Eisner is rooted out of Munich and shot, to the
rejoicing of the people of Munich.

<p>
1920- the German people hear Ford has just written a book on Jewish
communism, and as Kurt and Rosa were both Jewish, and as most of the
&quot;spartacus league&quot; were Jewish, millions of Germans buy Fords book.

<p>
Late 1920- no one is more surprised then Ford when his publisher says your
book is a best seller in Germany, they are holding you up as a
anti-communist demi god.
Ford was chuffed.

<p>
Ford was no Nazi, the Nazi was a Fordite, it is the chicken and the egg.

Hello Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That's an interesting timeline. Alas, it doesn't in any way
show that Henry Ford was not a Nazi sympathizer.
What that timeline leaves out is things like
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Ford_Intl_Jew" target="_blank">Henry Ford sending Hitler
50,000 Deutsche Marks each year on Hitler's birthday</a>.
And the timeline doesn't mention the mutual admiration society that Ford and Hitler had
going with each other. And you are totally ignoring Ford's famous diatribes and rants
against Jews in his <i>Dearborn Independent</i>.

<p>
Yes, the turmoil in Weimar Germany, with the leftists and the Fascists fighting in
the streets, is well-known history. But the radical leftists and Communists do not
excuse the radical right from responsibility for what they did, like mass murder
and genocide and racism and ethnic cleansing and waging war on innocent nations, and
starting World War Two and getting about 50 million people killed.
Now I know that the Communists were not any better.
They have a long list of crimes too, with millions more dead.  
Both extremes were wrong.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Avo,

This is stage 2 of the Big Book.

To see the first phase of financing and writing the Big Book, you have to look the records of the &quot;100 Men Corporation.&quot;  That was the name that the publishing company originally had.

Lip Balm Anonymous! At first glance I thought it was a joke, but the more I poked
around the sight, the more I became convinced these people are completely sincere
(and mentally challenged).  They maintain their &quot;sobriety&quot; from lip balm

the message to other lip balm addicts. Wow.

X-Mailer: iPad Mail (12B440)<br>

<p>
Holy Cow---

<p>
This article reminds me of the person who says &quot;my mind is made up, so don't confuse me with the facts&quot;

<p>
I gleaned the following from this article:

<p>
1.  It is HIGHLY unlikely that you have ever personally suffered from Alcoholism,
although I suppose, it's possible.
<p>
2.  If a person has had successful past experiences driving Ford's, they are highly likely to stick with a Ford when it's time to purchase another car.
<p>
3.  You have WAY too much free time on your hands, but, we live in a GREAT country and I respect the fact that you can spend your time any way you choose.

<p>
If an Alcoholic experiences a &quot; * spontaneous remission&quot;, where do they go to and why would it benefit them to fill out these &quot;surveys&quot; and participate in these &quot;studies&quot;?

<p>
* Is it like this?:  &quot;I've been suffering from Alcoholism for years.  It's ruined my marriage, I've lost jobs, my health is terrible, and I just can't stop drinking no matter how hard I've tried.  Then, one Tuesday morning, out of the blue, I thought, spontaneously, that I'll never drink again&quot; &#8212; that was 24 years ago and I attribute my sobriety to &quot;Spontaneous Remission&quot;

<p>
Try this idea out while discussing Alcoholism with any MD/Phd who specializes in Chemical Addictions.  That should make for a very interesting discussion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Dave,
<p>
Thanks for the opinion. Actually, if that Ph.D. knows his stuff, he will be the first
to admit that spontaneous remission is the biggest healer of alcoholics and drug addicts.

<p>

<center><table width="88%" border="3" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
The
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health,
performed the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions. For it, they interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol
dependence found in the DSM-IV, they found:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do
so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab)
programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever
receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
It's both amazing and appalling how A.A. members get so angry when you talk about 
spontaneous remission. Why is it that they just cannot stand the idea that people
stop drinking and drugging and heal themselves when the pain gets to be too much
and the fun too little?
<p>
Does it destroy their whole reality to hear that the slogan &quot;Nobody can do it alone&quot;
is so wrong?
<p>
By the way, yes, I was a hard-core alcoholic, dying from it.

<p>
I don't think &quot;they killed Robin Williams. I think he killed himself for a number of reasons.  First, he was ill.  Robin Williams and Michael J. Fox were both AAs and both with Parkinsons.  Robin chose not to live with whereas Michael Fox was only 30 when diagnosed and couldn't do anything BUT live with it.  They had a different level of acceptance.    Robin was also taken numerous pharms whose side effects included increased potential for suicide.  While I didn't live with him, he was adored by his children and got on well with his ex-wives.  I am not sure what guilt or shame you could assign to him.

<p>
I knew Audrey through an email correspondence.  She seemed upbeat and expansive.   Nice woman that I would have liked to have known personally.  She told me once that there were people who would judge her solely on one horrific incident.  It was as if everything that came afterward didn't matter or count.   While that is true, I doubt people in AA would have believed that, especially those of us with a history of drunk driving and being in blackouts.

Hope you've been well.

Hello Susan,
<p>
Thanks for the opinion, but that is just a language dodge.
<p>
Here in Portland Oregon we have
<a href="orange-letters265.html#Followers" target="_blank">a church that has fanatical members</a>
who kill their
children by refusing to get them proper medical care. They will not take their kids
to a doctor, no matter how sick the children are. They insist on only faith healing
and prayer. And down the road another church,
<a href="orange-letters419.html#Followers" target="_blank">in Albany, Oregon, the &quot;Church of the First-Born&quot;</a>,
does the same thing.
<p>
Two sets of those parents were just convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to prison
for killing their children. The Albany couple got 10 years in prison.
<p>
Now nobody accused those parents of picking up a knife or a gun and killing their children,
but the parents killed their children just the same.
The parents killed the children by foisting quackery on them. And that is how Hazelden
killed Robin Williams, too.
Instead of giving their severely-depressed patient good medical care, they gave him
guilt-inducing superstition and cult religion, and pushed him right over the edge into
suicide. That is manslaughter. That is killing somebody.

<p>
And yes, we can establish how Robin Williams felt guilty:
<p>
Shaming and guilt induction are a big part of the 12-Step program. And they can
produce very bad results. They can drive depressed people to suicide. I blame
the Hazelden routine of repeatedly making Robin Williams do Steps 4 and 5 for
his death. Steps 4 and 5, I'm sure you know, are where the &quot;client&quot; lists and
confesses all of his sins, moral shortcomings, wrongs, and defects of character.
After 28 days of that routine in a previous stay in Hazelden, Robin Williams
confessed to Guardian newspaper reporters that it was so hard to live down all
of the things that he had done, &quot;You know, I was shameful, and you do stuff that
causes disgust, and that's hard to recover from. You can say, 'I forgive you'
and all that stuff, but it's not the same as recovering from it. It's not coming
back.&quot; See:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005626/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/20/robin-williams-worlds-greatest-dad-alcohol-drugs" target="_blank">
http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/20/robin-williams-worlds-greatest-dad-alcohol-drugs</a>
<p>
One more trip through Hazelden, and one more repetition of Steps 4 and 5,
and he committed suicide.
When he went into Hazelden, Robin Williams was talking about &quot;fine-tuning&quot; his sobriety.
But when they were done with him, he didn't last a month.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello again, Keith,

Nothing like starting off with

You began your previous letter by declaring,

Apparently you aren't feeling so religious today, are you?

<p>
Yes, you are misinformed. You think that Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion actually
works as treatment for the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;. That is grossly misinformed.
And, in your previous letter,
you declared that A.A. is a big success because it &quot;brings joy to people&quot;.
That is also grossly misinformed. A.A. is supposed to save the lives of alcoholics,
but it doesn't do that, so jabbering about the &quot;joy&quot; that some members get is
merely a distraction.

<p>
And I have received numerous letters from  people who said
that learning the truth from my web site did help them, so yes, the web site

This premise is false:

Nobody has tried everything else. Nobody.
I also sent you a chart of more than 40 different treatment programs where Professors Miller and Hester
rated them for effectiveness. Brief Intervention was number one and A.A. and 12-Step Facilitation were
numbers 37 and 38, so far down the list that you have to look for them:

== The same statistics in a different format
</ul>
<p>

I have never met anyone who tried the previous 36 methods before going to an A.A.
meeting and declaring that he tried everything before A.A. and nothing worked.
It's a common slogan in A.A. meetings, &quot;I tried everything else, and nothing
worked before A.A.&quot;, but it's untrue.
Usually, people try one or two or maybe three other things and then declare that
they tried everything.  That is just the standard cult characteristics of
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea" target="_blank">We have the panacea</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_denigrate_others" target="_blank">Denigration of
competing organizations or groups</a>.

<p>
Now then, back to your question: If someone had tried to quit drinking several times, and failed,
I would first send him to a psychiatrist to see what shape his brain and mind are in.
Mental illness is one of the commonest causes of alcohol abuse.
Excessive drinking is merely a &quot;symptom&quot; or sign of the underlying disorder.
Obviously, quit-drinking programs do not cure mental illness.

<p>
Mentally-ill people often get into trouble with drugs and alcohol as they try to
fix themselves with self-medication.  A friend just showed me a BBC &#8212;
Stephen Fry TV program about Bipolar Disorder, which Fry suffers from.  Fry
interviewed many people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder, and every single one
of them had gotten into trouble with drugs and alcohol.  It was like a standard
characteristic of the disease.

<p> 
Obviously, those people would not be helped by a guilt-inducing 12-Step cult religion.

<p>
So first, let's check out the &quot;alcoholics&quot; and see what their real problem is.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
If they are not mentally ill, then they should be able to get a grip and stop their irrational compulsive
behavior. They should benefit from something like SMART or SOS or WFS or Lifering.
<li>
But if they are suffering from mental illness, then fix that first. Often, the &quot;alcoholism&quot;
and &quot;drug-seeking behavior&quot; disappear when the underlying illness is successfully treated.
</ul>

<p>
About your complaint about an attachment, I always answer letters with attached web pages
because I answer all letters in HTML format so that the same answer can go on the
web site and also get emailed to the correspondent.  Also, links don't work if the
answer isn't in web page format.
If you refuse to read an attached web page, then I can't help you with that.
And my answers are not &quot;scripted&quot;.
I'm actually wasting my time writing an original answer to your letter
(which you may refuse to read).

Have a good day now.

Subject: Thanks for the reply<br>

<p>
Thank you for the reply.

<p>
It is not possible for me to answer your question about success rate.  You make some very valid points.  I am not sure if we can agree on a definition of success.

<p>
I would estimate a very small success rate if you count everyone that has ever attended an AA meeting.  I would estimate a very high success rate for those that have completed the first eight steps and continue with making amends, personal inventory, prayer, mediation and working with others.

<p>
You might feel these things as unnecessary or fake.  I am not real sure what you believe.  I believe that a spiritual awaking can change a person. I also believe that there are other ways for people to change.  I also believe that there are other ways for people to stop drinking.  AA and the 12 steps are not the only way.

<p>
For me, AA has worked.  Maybe something else might have worked, but up to that point in my life, nothing else had worked.

<p>
You have much more information and knowledge about AA and I think that is awesome.

<p>
I can see how a person would feel that AA hurts more than it helps.  Since there is no real leadership, groups and members can spread teachings that are not in alignment with basic AA principles.  No member of AA should ever suggest someone stop taking medication.  Heck, members of AA need to not give medical, financial or martial advice.  But they do.

<p>
So what do you think the success rate is?  What methods do you think are successful?

<p>
Thanks again for your well thought out response.

Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the reply. And it seems to be well thought out too.
<p>
Well, starting at the top,
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;It is not possible for me to answer your question about success rate.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Other people have managed to answer that question  &#8212;
 credible people, like doctors  &#8212; 
and they have found that A.A. has a zero percent success rate, above
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">normal spontaneous remission</a>.
That includes
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.</a>

<p>
Bill Wilson's statement on page 58 of the Big Book, which is read out loud at the
start of every A.A. meeting, is a lie, pure and simple:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our
path. Those who do not recover are those who cannot or will not give
themselves completely to this simple program, usually men and women
who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.
There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have
been born that way.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Wilson was of course <a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers">Lying With Qualifiers</a>.
He only wanted to count those who &quot;thoroughly followed our path&quot;.
But the first requirement for &quot;thoroughly following our path&quot;
is to quit drinking. So it's like a circular definition: 
Only count those people who quit drinking, and darned if you don't have a 100% success rate.

<p><li>
Then you continued with,
<font color="black">
 You make some very valid points.
</font>
<p>
Thanks. I try hard to have information that is accurate and truthful and complete.
People's lives are on the line.

<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
I sure hope that we can agree on a definition of success. The idea was to save the
lives of the alcoholics. Obviously, if they die from alcohol, then the program is not
a success. If they don't stop self-destructive drinking, then the program failed.

<p>
I don't care whether people totally abstain from drinking or
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="_blank">simply cut down
to moderate, controlled drinking</a>, 
just as long as they stop self-destuctive
levels of drinking. If they were dying from alcohol, and now they are no longer
dying, and their health is good now, then I would call that a success.
<p>
Now personally, I find that even small amounts of alcohol are damaging.
But other people seem to feel that a little drinking doesn't harm them.
So be it.

<p>
I agree that the overall success rate of A.A.
is very, very low  &#8212;  so low that it is no more
than the success rate that untreated alcoholics get
by quitting on their own.

<p>
Your last sentence is again using qualifiers to limit those people who get counted.
And they have to be devoted cult members who faithfully practice Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion, praying and meditating and confessing and apologizing
 and all of that.  But only a convinced
true believer will do that. So what you are really saying is that if some people
will devote their lives to a cult religion, then they won't drink alcohol.
But even that cure only works on a very few people  &#8212;  only those people who
find cult religion an acceptable way of life.

<p>
Yes, I feel that Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion is a fake. It is fraud and heretical
pseudo-spirituality.
See <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a> for
more about that.

<p>
I am not knocking all spirituality or spiritual awakenings.  Alas, there are lots of fakes
around.  I am a child of the 'sixties, and I saw a wave of aroused interest in spirituality
among the young generation of the 'sixties, quickly followed by a wave of fake gurus
who sprang up to steal their money, their hearts and minds, and their souls.
Dr. Frank Buchman and his bastard child called Alcoholics Anonymous is just more of the same
fraud.
Cult religion is a very old game.

<p><li>
Now here is one of the key points, and one of the biggest problems that I have with
the whole A.A. rap:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For me, AA has worked.  Maybe something else might have worked, but up to that point in my life, nothing else had worked.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What worked?  What the heck is the real A.A. program?
<p> 
<ul>
<p><li>
It can't be <i>Working The Steps</i>, because Bill Wilson wrote on page 59 that
the Steps are only &quot;suggested as a program of recovery&quot;.  So you can
still be a good A.A. member without <i>Working The Steps</i>.
<p><li>
It can't be going to meetings. Bill bragged about the early &quot;lone wolf&quot;
A.A. members who lived way out in the country where there were no meetings,
and who just bought the book and got sober alone.
<p><li>
But it also can't be reading the book. When I criticize the insane things
that the <i>Big Book</i> says, some A.A. true believers invariably write
to me to brag that they have years of sobriety and have never read The Book.
<p><li>
And it can't be getting a sponsor. When I criticize
abuses of the sponsorship system,
someone declares that he never had a sponsor, and sponsorship isn't even
mentioned in the <i>Big Book</i>. (It is heavily recommended in Bill's second book,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.)

<p><li>
It can't be praying and meditating.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">Bill Wilson declared that you don't have to believe anything.</a>
<p>
So since I don't believe in Doorknob Almighty, I don't have to pray to Him.
And I don't have to meditate in Step 11 and hear Him talking to me and telling me what to do,
and giving me the power to carry out His orders.

<p><li>
So what is The Path that A.A. members are supposed to thoroughly follow?
What &quot;WORKS&quot; for you? What is the real essential heart of the Program?

</ul>

<p>
And when you say that nothing else worked, what are you talking about?
How many other methods did you really try?
A.A. members routinely repeat that slogan about, &quot;I tried everything, and nothing
worked before A.A.&quot;
<p>
But that isn't true. They didn't try everything. Often, they didn't try more than two
or three things before declaring that &quot;nothing else worked&quot;.
There are more than 40 treatment modalities to try.

<p>
We were just talking about that in a previous letter, so I won't repeat it all again.<br>
Look here:
<a href="orange-letters423.html#Miller" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters423.html#Miller</a>
<p>
And then of course there is the problem that people stop looking for an answer after
they quit drinking.
They just assume that the last thing that they tried is what worked, rather than that
quitting and not restarting is a learning experience.

<p>
Heck, by that logic I can declare that living in a homeless men's shelter and eating pizza
is what worked for me.  Nothing else worked before that, but the pizza worked. I haven't
had a drink since, and it's been 14 years now. So that pizza is unbelievably powerful
medicine.
See the story here:
<a href="orange-letters26.html#what_works" target="_blank">The magic moment of quitting</a>.

<p>
Even a previous Trustee of A.A. wrote about that problem with the logic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Another root of Professional-AA strains consists of the very human
tendency to be loyal to the therapy which has been successful in one's own case &#8212;
and rather uncritically to adopt the ideological framework within which the help
has come. We see this phenomenon in other areas. For example, the benefits of
religious faith and personal integration can come through many different theological
frames of reference &#8212; Roman Catholic, Pentacostal, Christian Science, Theosophy,
Zen Buddhism, you name it. And, so often, the help found is taken as absolute
proof of the truth of the accompanying theological framework. Or, witness what
happens when a patient has shopped around from doctor to doctor, and finally finds one
that helps: he becomes very loyal to the successful therapist &#8212; and to the successful
therapeutic program. Why should the behavior of alcoholics be so different? I've
been in alcoholism clinic and hospital settings where I've heard: &quot;I tried the
'cure' over there. I tried AA. None of it worked. But this place has got the
answers.&quot;
<font color="#9F0000">
And I've heard alcoholics talk who had boxed the professional compass
and finally made it in AA. In either case, the reason for the success of the
particular treatment may have been due more to the patient's by-now greater pain and
desperation than to the nature of the treatment or the context of beliefs.
But few
patients can see this at the time and they become loyal to the &quot;successful therapy&quot; &#8212;
and, unfortunately, sometimes antagonistic or unfavorable in their attitude toward
other therapeutic programs.
</font>
Now, I submit that this is quite standard human behavior.
But it is one of the roots of misunderstanding, distrust, and strain in AA-professional
relations.<br>

<p>
It isn't a matter of the leadership. (Which is bad, but that isn't the most important thing.)
 It's a matter of killing people with quackery and cult religion.
That is the primary cause of A.A. deaths.  Telling people that they are powerless over
alcohol produces disastrously bad results.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Remember that Dr. Vaillant discovered</a>, after 8 years of testing A.A.
on alcoholics, that the
biggest effect that A.A. had on alcoholics was raising the death rate in his patients.
<p>
Likewise, telling people that they drink alcohol because they have moral shortcomings
and defective characters is very harmful and produces more bad results.
A.A. is just the opposite of good psychotherapy.

<p>
Your second sentence, about groups spreading teachings that are not
&quot;aligned&quot; with &quot;basic AA principles&quot;, is so true. Look at
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">
Clancy's Clones</a>
and
<a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html" target="_blank">Mike Quinones' &quot;Midtown Group&quot;</a>,
both of which are sexual exploitation societies,
in addition to being basically fascist organizations where one dictator rules the roost.
So, since A.A. has no control over A.A. groups, and it cannot be reformed and fixed,
the best thing to do is shut it down and replace it with better organizations that
won't elevate the death rate in alcoholics.

<p> 
We agree about how A.A. sponsors should not be playing doctor and telling people not to
take their medications. But they do.
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank"> It is rampant in A.A.</a>,
those nutty sponsors really believe in faith healing, and again, since all
A.A. groups are beyond control, there is no way to stop it.
Again, shut down A.A. before it kills more sick people.

<p>
<li>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So what do you think the success rate is?  What methods do you think are successful?
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Which success rate?
<p>
The success rate of Alcoholics Anonymous is the same as the normal rate of spontaneous
remission in alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
In other words, the success rate that is caused by A.A. practices is zero.
A.A. is merely stealing the credit from a few people who were going to
quit drinking anyway.
<p>
By the way, the normal rate of spontaneous
remission in alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction is about 5% per year.
Each year, about one out of 20 of the drinking alcoholics decide that they
are sick and tired of being sick and tired, and don't want to die that way.
They quit because the pain has gotten to be too much, or to save their marriages
and careers, or for their health, or because of legal difficulties, or for
a variety of other similar reasons.

<p>
If you mean the success rate of other organizations or methods, that is an open question.
We don't have nearly enough good, valid, controlled studies of all of the different
treatment modalities.
A.A. promoters have obstructed and sabotaged such studies and tests for years,
like how
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH" target="_blank">they sabotaged Project MATCH</a>,
complaining that giving &quot;no treatment&quot; to
alcoholics was unethical. (But giving them an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the
nineteen-thirties is &quot;ethical&quot;.)

<p>
The one thing that we do know about those other treatment methods and modalities is
that none of them yields as high a death rate as Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
While Dr. George E. Vaillant was testing A.A. on his alcoholic patients</a>, he also
studied other treatment methods, and found that A.A. had the highest death rate
of any treatment program that he studied.

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
The one test that I know of, Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma's test,
where A.A. was directly compared to another treatment program</a>  &#8212; 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  &#8212;  produced dramatic results.  After several months of
treatment, the A.A. group was doing five times as much binge drinking as the control
group which got no treatment at all, and the A.A. group was doing nine times as
much binge drinking as the CBT group.
The moral of the story is, teaching people that they are powerless over alcohol is
a self-fulfilling prediction.
When they come to believe it, they will act like it.
<p>
Obviously, CBT got a higher success rate, but I'm not sure how much higher.
I need to get that book back and study it again.
(See:
<i>Outpatient Treatment of Alcoholism</i>, by
Jeffrey Brandsma, Maxie Maultsby, and Richard J. Welsh. University
Park Press, Baltimore, MD., page 105.)
