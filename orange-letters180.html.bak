Subject:<br>

<p>
Hello &#8212; 

<p>
I appreciate that this won't be the most disturbing story you have read but I'd like
to write out my recent experiences in NA.

<p>
9 months ago at the age of 36 I realized my drinking had got way out of hand. I'd
used drugs for years and stopped, but just switched to alcohol, which was making me
feel worse than drugs ever did. I had been drinking every day for about 3 years and
couldnt go much more than a few days sober when I tried to stop.

<p>
I had met somebody in a fellowship a few years ago who had recommended 12 steps to
me and one night decided to go to an NA meeting &#8212; I had abused both alcohol and
drugs, but mainly drugs so I chose NA.

<p>
Without doubt going to meetings helped me enormously. After work all day and
travelling to a meeting at night I was too tired to think about going to the pub by
the time I got home.

<p>
I really enjoyed being around clean and sober people after many years of boring pub
life. The god stuff/contradictory terminology alarmed me slightly but I was so
desperate to stop drinking and make some new friends I didn't analyse it too much.

<p>
I was told to get a sponsor and after 2 weeks I asked somebody who chaired my &quot;home&quot;
group, lived nearby, and grew up close to me. I thought we would have a lot in
common. He had been through a 12 step treatment centre and seemed to know everything
there was to know about NA. He told me to do 90 days clean so the fog could
clear, before step work, which seemed a reasonable demand.

<p>
I got through my 90 days and went to a couple of conventions and Unity days which I
enjoyed very much. At the point I had no complaints and went to 4 or 5 meets a week.
I was starting to adjust to straight life after about 20 years of drink and drugs
and it was great to share it with other &quot;clean&quot; people.

<p>
My sponsor asked me to write my life story, which I did in 15 pages. It was very
hard to do and it did bring up a lot of things I haven't thought about in many years.
We set a date for me to read it out to him. It was 2pm on a Saturday. I was working
in a job with long hours at the time and my Saturdays were quite special to me, plus
this was the 1st time I had ever trusted anyone with something like my life story
and was quite nervous about it. My sponsor knew all this.

<p>
2pm came and went. At 4.10pm I got a text &#8212; not a phone call but a text &#8212; saying he
was ill and couldn't make it. I was shocked by this, and really hurt by the lack of
consideration. My sponsor &#8212; like almost everyone in my home group, didn't work and
lived off benefits. I started to realize that times and dates didn't really matter to
him as he didn't have the bother of work getting in the way &#8212; one day was as good as
the next, and it didn't matter if you were late. I tried to forgive and understand
this behaviour and eventually we did make a date to read out my life story.

<p>
I didn't really know what it was I supposed to do next. At this point I trusted my
sponsor and saw him as somebody who was going to guide me on some sort of spiritual
path.

<p>
I noticed that he literally never called me, and often didn't respond to texts or
calls. I knew he didn't have much money so I set him up with an internet based text
service so he could communicate with me. I think he used it once.

<p>
After meets we would go out for a meal sometimes &#8212; but nobody ever had any money and
I often paid for peoples food as I worked. I did this willingly but noticed that
lack of any kind of appreciation. Out of about ten regular attendees I got to know
only one worked, and the others did not work and also had no intention of working.
This grated me a bit as I worked very hard and the idea of years on the dole which
most people had wasn't something I could understand.

<p>
As nobody ever had any money the groups I attended never really did anything
together. I thought that there might have been a social aspect to NA and that we
would be getting together to share the joys of recovery. I noticed that much like
active drug users there was lots of talk about doing this or that, but it never
actually happened. I noticed that when it was somebodys clean time birthday nobody
got it together to buy a card. Nobody really did much of anything except
occasionally go to meetings.

<p>
When people did manage to go for a bite to eat after the meetings, I noticed people
pretty much just talked about themselves and their chaotic lives. I started to think
that if after years clean and doing all these steps people still seem as stuck in
the rounds of divorce, out of control children, affairs, lack of cash, unhappiness,
relapses etc I wonder what good NA is doing for them exactly? I thought I would be
meeting stable and consistent people who had defeated their worst behaviours.

<p>
Some people did stay clean but the large majority of people I met either stopped
coming, stopped responding to phone calls, or relapsed. After about 4 months I
started to get a bit bored of hearing literally the same story every week from the
same people. Nobody I knew seemed to be making any progress in their lives, but I
felt awful for being so judgemental. I went to various other meetings near to where I
lived and found pretty much the same story at every one &#8212; unemployed people saying
the same things every week. I started to notice people who ONLY went to NA meetings
in their lives.

<p>
One guy in particular was at almost every one I went to round the city where I live
and a lot of his shares were about his problems and resentments within NA! I started
to notice various people like this. I wondered what the point of 3 meetings a day
was for these people if they didn't particularly enjoy most of the ones they went to.
I met people who worked in treatment centres doing 12 step work all day and then
went to meetings in the evening which struck me as a bit obsessive. I'd say some the
strangest and most unhinged people I have met in NA work in treatment centres.

<p>
I started to struggle sharing as I had told all my war stories and didn't really have
anything else to say as I didn't believe in god, I hadn't experienced any miracles, I
had my urges to use under control, and had no plans or desires to use again. My life
wasn't the constant struggle that most NA members seemed to experience.

<p>
My sponsor didn't have any plan for me at all it turned out. He didn't have any plan
for himself either. He collected his benefits and played a lot of computer games and
smoked a lot of cigarettes. He said the stress of work would send him back to drugs
so it was best to stay unemployed. He has 4 children by 3 mothers. He occasionally
sees one of them and makes no effort to provide in any way for them financially. He
didn't do any meditation or written step work or do anything around NA that I could
see, aside from go to the closest meeting to where he lives that he can walk to.

<p>
I started to have doubts about all the god stuff and started to see major
differences between the way people talked in meetings and the way they lived their
lives. People who spouted texts and emails about the ecstasy of god-given recovery
and the joys of living day by day in a new light of golden love in the fellowship
etc etc.... when I actually talked to them after the meeting they seemed just as
miserable/totally self-obsessed/uninterested as everyone else does.

<p>
Eventually my sponsor's sponsor noticed that nothing was happening with any progress
re:step work and took me on, and my first sponsor has completely avoided talking to
me about it ever since. I think my 1st sponsor just liked the idea of saying he had
a sponsee and was flattered that I asked him, but never had clue as to what to do
with me in any practical sense.

<p>
My next sponsor was another let down. He has 3 children and 2 jobs and a demanding
wife, and whenever we made an arrangement to meet it got cancelled, or he would just
forget. I can't say how many times he would say he was going to phone me and then
didn't. To this day he has never been round to my place and we live about 3 miles
away from each other. I gave up after a couple of months and asked somebody else.
They said yes, and after 5 days called me back to say they had changed their mind. I
asked a few other people and they all said no for various reasons.

<p>
I have the keys to a local church meeting as nobody else was willing to commit to
turn up. Last week I got there and nobody turned up. I was sat there on my own for a
few minutes feeling pretty wiped out. I called and texted people and nobody got back
to me. That was 4 days ago and Ive not heard from anybody out of about 10 regulars.
Whilst I was sat there alone I realized a few stark truths.

<p>
I realized that after 9 months of constantly going to NA meetings I wouldn't say I
have met anybody that I can rely on. On the days when I am struggling I just tend to
get on with it as best I can because I know that if I call somebody its probably
they won't answer the phone or be in the middle of some drama of their own. I
realized that there was nobody who gave me any answers to my questions about being
an atheist and I was behaving like a fake by reading out all the cards with all the
god stuff when I didn't understand it or believe it myself. I hadn't received or heard
any practical advice or instruction on any of the words that constantly get read out
 &#8212; prayer, god , meditation, disease, spirituality, etc. I realized I was going to
meetings for something to do and because I was avoiding all my ex-drinking buddies.
A couple of meetings I go to are in small towns and really struggle for people to
attend and I felt guilty if I didn't go.

<p>
I don't belive in god, so I can't believe in prayer to that god, I don't believe in
miracles, I don't believe in the disease idea, I don't believe that people who do the
12 steps are any better or worse off than people who stop on willpower.  I realized
if all that is true then why on earth am I going to NA meetings.

<p>
I realized that the large majority of people who had done the 12 steps and were
supposedly living spriritual lives still smoked like chimneys, often didn't work,
often didn't turn up for meets when they said they would,  and didn't seem very happy
about anything. I must have given my telephone number to old timers a hundred times
over, but nobody ever called me to see how I was doing or come round. When I tried
to think about &quot;sticking with the winners&quot; I didn't really know who the winners were
anymore. I thought &#8212; if I can do 9 months without god and without any steps or
sponsorship &#8212; why not not just carry on as I am? what is it NA is doing for me
exactly?

<p>
Lastly &#8212; 

<p>
A few months ago there was a committee formed to organise a convention in our area.
The mimimum clean time required was 2 years, and obviously some experience in
service. So I went along to it expecting to meet the creme-de-la-creme of the local
NA populace. Its been chaotic to say the least. In the first meeting there was an
all-out fist fight. Since then almost everyone that made a 1 year commitment has
dropped out, and we have never had a meeting yet where all the committee members
actually turn up at the same time. I've been in a room with supposedly the most
committed and longest clean people in my area and frankly it's so unstable I dread
going.

<p>
It did me some good and I don't hate it &#8212; but NA is just too much for to swallow. Too
much of it doesnt make any sense. Your website helped re-adjust my brain.

<p>

Hello &#8212; 

<p>
Also you may be interested to know since i stopped going to meetings I havent had
any contact with anyone I met over the last 8 months. I got a postcard from one guy
but thats it. I've bumped in to a couple of people by chance, but nobody has called
to see where I am or if I am OK. NA has been such a let down.

<p>
I really wish that it was like its described in the literature and that people
behaved as suggested in all the cards and books. If it was like that, then I would
be much more interested in sticking around.

<p>
Cheers, sc

Hi again, SC,
<p>
You know, I've heard that so many times. If you dare to leave A.A. or N.A.,
then all of your &quot;friends&quot; who give you all of that &quot;unconditional love&quot;
will dump you and ostracize you. Loneliness can be a big problem for people
who quit any cult. (The only exception to that
pattern seems to be the stalkers, who just won't stop trying to get a
&quot;straying&quot; member back.)
<p>
On the bright side, now you can get some real friends.
<p>
So have a good life.

Subject:  	is this programing? please help<br>

<p>
or should i be expecting the truth from the programers?

<p>
love of truth played an important roll on the page before the tobacco programing page.

<p>
Im only guessing that you are also programed to feel good about pot smokers lives
purposly ruined by imprisonment, even knowing they will be raped and tortured for
daring to have a mind any more free than yourself. Im not programing you as i
believe it to be evil. and teaching is not programing. Im simply saying read your
own pages, and learn from your own words you ignorant repeater of government
propaganda. fyi the lung deaths are comming from your car thats why people dont lock
themselves in their car with a carton to kill themselves, cause if it wont turn the
roadside snow black as coal or be effective to cause immediate harm to you. anyone
whos ever tried a cigarette knows they are bad for you and not a wise habbit to
aquire. an even worse habbit is letting your thoughts and beliefs come from any
source than your own educated mind. you do hate pot smokers dont you?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kryssi,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, but please, hold on right there.
<p>
I don't know what you are reading, but you have it totally backwards. I'm an old hippie
who lived on a commune up in the mountains of northern New Mexico,
and I smoked pot more times than I can count, or even estimate.
<p>
 There was one guy on our
commune who had done three years in San Quentin prison for possession of three joints
(marijuana cigarettes). He was totally freaked, and never recovered from the experience.
He spent the rest of his life on that commune, hiding from the outside world.
He just died recently at the age of 70. May he rest in peace.
<p>
What was done to him is simply totally unjustifiable.
<p>
No, I do not approve of the marijuana prohibition at all. In fact, I'd rather see my children
smoking pot than drinking alcohol. Pot kills far fewer people. Like alcohol kills 100,000
U.S. citizens per year, while pot kills maybe 1 or 2 or maybe none.
<p>
Still, I think that smoking nothing is better for you. It is better to be clear-headed.
And its better for your lungs to keep them smoke-free. But if the
kids have to get high on something, then pot is one of the least harmful choices.

</font>
<p>
 do you realize
that that the cia lists it as an herb that supresses succeptability to propaganda
such as the tobacco page on your site. A lot of people are just learning of mind
control and the cia use of it to program the whole country and the world little at a
time. with the amount of decent info here, people tend to read on until they see
some crap like you describe on previous pages, come to being on the next page. What
the fuck does your tobacco page have to do with mind control anyway. investigate pot
from non biased sources, then smoke a joint, which will cure your asthma!, and then
seek help with your own programing, this may help you stop being an ignorant
propagandist. tobacco was the 3rd page i read here, but even with some good info and
original info, im looking for NO more mis-info. that concludes this nasty-gram, good
luck with that freedom of thought thing, and bless you for any truth pass along. cia
monarch mind control  mk-ultra programing,

<p>
know this 9/11 was a nationwide program thats why it remained on live tv. these are
true mind control and purely evil. google it. always up for intelligent debate, not
politics.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, I don't know what you are reading.
<a href="orange-tobacco.html" target="newwin7893">My web page on tobacco</a>
does not even mention pot or marijuana.
Neither does my web page on
<a href="orange-deprogram.html" target="newwin7892">How To Deprogram Your Own Mind</a>.

<p>
And I'm not biased against marijuana, and I have smoked it. And unlike Bill Clinton,
I inhaled. A lot. And I had a good time, too.
<p>
But that was then, and this is now. And now I haven't smoked pot in 9 1/2 years, and I'm
enjoying life without it.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	hostage taking?<br>

<p>
Dear Friend,

<p>
This is one recovery concept you seem to have missed discussing. It is
possibly dealt with inherently in discussions of &quot;co-dependency&quot; and
&quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; (as one tool for impressing conformity, etc.) I have
often heard &quot;Oh, well, we often take hostages in our first year of
recovery.&quot; etc. It is one of those things that, if not totally meaningless,
I have no clear idea of what is meant. For instance I have heard &quot;doing a
geographical&quot; defined as making an ill-conceived attempt to consciously and
&quot;soberly&quot; escape problems by picking up and  moving some distance, or else
getting totally bombed and waking up several states away from where you
started. At least, in that case, I can cherry pick either meaning to embrace
or discard. For me, it seems preferable to have a clearer idea of what I do
or do not believe in.

<p>
Just curious if the hostage thing has ever blipped your radar.

<p>
Thanks for the inspiration and good work,

<p>
Fred

<p>
PS  Is &quot;hostage taking&quot; sometimes a euphemism for &quot;13th stepping?&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Fred,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the question. That's a new one to me. I had not heard that
slogan before. My first impression is that they are again accusing alcoholics of
being manipulative,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I will relapse and return to drinking if you don't do what I want.&quot;<br>
&quot;I will drink again if you displease me.&quot;<br>
</font>
But that is just a guess.

<p>
And who was notorious for doing that?
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="newwin99">Bill Wilson</a>.
<p>
Maybe the readers have some ideas of what is meant by &quot;taking hostages&quot;.
<p>
And I totally agree about how things would be better if they would clearly define their terms.
(But if they did that, it would be too obvious that it's a bunch of illogical bull.)
<p>
Have a good day now.

<h3>AA and NA people</h3>

<p>
Date: 2010-06-30,  8:26AM

<p>
I have dated a woman in AA, one in NA, and almost dated another in AA.  This is my
experience with it.

<p>
The first woman in AA &#8212; what a mess!  She had been sober for a very long time, good
for her.  But she was so screwed up.  She had a friend, Rich, who was a complete ass
to waitresses (and people in general) and his rudeness never bothered her, she
actually claimed she admired him for being &quot;honest&quot; with people.  What the hell?  A
waitress walked up to our table to take our order and before she could finish
talking he's criticizing her for her expression and how she asked for our order.  I
was embarrassed, I actually apologized to her and said he &quot;just got out and hasn't
learned how to deal with society yet&quot;.  She smiled, my date got mad at me for that,
and I was on Rich's shit list for that.  What a jerk.  She never wanted to date him,
but you could tell he wanted her.  She went to meetings a couple times a week and
was convinced that she couldn't function on her own without having a sponsor at her
beck and call.  She was cute, but had the personality of a potato.

<p>
The woman in NA &#8212; she thought AA was a joke.  Ironic, isn't it?  She had been clean
for over a dozen years, alcohol and drugs.  She would go to these meetings and tell
a complete stranger (read that: drug addict) all about her personal life, but would
never tell me a single thing about her former drug use &#8212; telling me that it was not
my business.  And she was like Rainman, I swear.  If she washed her car, she had to
wash her truck.  Couldn't just wash one without doing the other.  Bath towels had to
be a certain size or she wouldn't use them.  When she wanted to wash her face, it
had to be a white, square wash cloth.  Colors were not to be used, and forget about
using a kitchen towel, even though it was made of the same terry cloth!  Oh, and
don't ever mispronounce anything, that made her feel  &quot;stupid&quot;.  Yeah, she actually
said that to me.  Of course, Wopner is on at 4:30.  Yeah, she's an excellent
driver.

<p>
The woman I almost dated in AA &#8212; what a freak show!  Our first conversation involved
her telling me about the drama between some guy from her meeting and what he said to
some girl who was friends with some other girl who liked...ah, who the hell cares???
That one phone call was enough for me.  I hadn't even gone out with her yet, and
already she's dragging me into this conspiracy conversation trying to get me to
dislike some guy I never met for doing something I never saw to someone else I
didn't know.

<p>
As for AA/NA &#8212; I'm glad that people who *believe* they have a problem are correcting
it, but I have yet to meet anyone in either group who wasn't a taco short of a
combination platter.  If I meet a woman who doesn't drink, I need to find out why
before I date her.  If she even says &quot;AA&quot; or &quot;alcoholic&quot; to me, I'm not interested.
I'm sure they aren't all like that, but the few people I have known, and the couple
women I've dated, who were involved in AA or NA were very strange.

Hi again, Istj,
<p>
Thanks for the posting. What that tells me is that assuming that a group of ex-addicts
have the answers to life, the universe, and everything, just might be a huge mistake.

<p>
Does hanging out with a group of people who declare that they have a disease that cannot
ever be cured make you healthy?
<p>
And above all, should you get one of those people as your sponsor, and have them instructing
you, telling you how to live?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange,

<p>
For the most part, I consider your coverage on how AA goes way over their bounds to
be very revealing.  This includes such matters as some members apparently giving out
medical and legal advice.   I am glad I no longer attend those meetings and I am
still completely alcohol-free.

<p>
Here is one thing that disturbs me, however:  On answering
<a href="orange-letters178.html#vitamins" target="newwin1771">one of your letters (answered on July 9, 2010)</a>,
you wrote the following:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

...  &quot; I recommend a couple of things:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
  B Vitamins. Actually, all vitamins. That is, get a good high-potency
one-a-day &quot;everything&quot; vitamin pill, and also a good high-potency B-complex with C
pill. Personally, I take Centrum Silver, B-Complex, more C, Calcium, and aspirin,
twice a day. The B vitamins help the brain to heal sooner &#8212; they really help a lot.
The calcium is for osteoporosis, which alcohol can cause, too. The aspirin is for
blood thinning, and the pain of arthritis, and to prevent headaches. After living on
a liquid diet for many years, my body can easily feel dehydrated when I'm not
constantly guzzling something wet, so thinning the blood is a good thing.

<p>
<li> [snip]
</ol>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Particularly, I am the most concerned with recommendation # 1 .  With all kidding
aside, even though these are &quot;over-the-counter&quot; medications, couldn't  that  in some
ways be considered giving out medical advice?

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Neal

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh come on now, Neal,
<p>
That is really extreme. Vitamins are food, not
&quot;over-the-counter medications&quot;. Complaining about vitamins sounds like the Steppers
who complain that people who take medications don't have &quot;perfect sobriety&quot;.
<p>
Vitamins are good food and they help you to heal.
<p>
Now if you really want to stretch the point, advising people to take vitamins could be
construed as &quot;giving medical advice&quot;, just like advising people to eat good food and
to eat a balanced diet is also &quot;giving medical advice&quot;.
So is telling people to get some exercise and quit being a couch potato.
But that is just too extreme.
<p>
What most people mean when they talk about A.A. sponsors giving medical advice is
things like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't take your doctor-prescribed medications. Just trust God and the Twelve Steps
to heal you.&quot;
</font>

<p>
And also,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Doctors and psychiatrists don't know anything about addictions. Don't waste
your time going to them. Just listen to your sponsor.&quot;

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Attached is a piece of unofficial AA propaganda.
[<a href="Unnamed_AA2_Group_File-Midwest_pre_2005.pdf">Unnamed_AA2_Group_File-Midwest_pre_2005.pdf</a>]
I found it in the files of
an AA group in the MidWest that I attended for a while. I don't think that
it was generated by our group &#8212; nobody in the group even knew that it
existed. This is the factually false, medically and psychologically
dangerous, cultish, psychobabble, pseudoscience garbage that pervades AA.
This is the stuff that G.S.O. says they are &quot;not responsible for&quot; since each
group or area is autonomous. And although that seems like a nice out, AA and
GSO are ultimately responsible for this garbage existing in and around AA
meetings and rehabs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, &quot;iamnotastatistic&quot;,
<p>
Thank you for this document. It is really something else. And you are quite right
about how they evade responsibility for their own propaganda. In the same vein,
I just got a book from Goodwill, <i>Getting Started in AA</i>, by Hamilton B.,
published by Hazelden. It is totally A.A. propaganda, of course, a bunch of bull,
but when I criticize the contents of books like that, some Stepper invariably
objects and says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are criticizing us for literature that is not official A.A.
literature, not published by A.A. and is not Council-approved.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Ah yes, the joys of having front groups.
<p>
And yes, that document strikes me as
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;How to use a bunch of slides to sell cult religion and quack medicine.&quot;
</font>

</font>
<p>
Rather than go through this utter nonsense in detail I think that it's
enough to look at the decision tree on page 4......<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

There appear to be only two choices for the alcoholic:<br>
1. Believe and Accept Spiritual Help on the way to Sanity And Sobriety OR<br>
2. Disbelieve and Continue Drinking on the way to Insanity Or Death
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Weird, that doesn't sound like the nice soft voice of AA in the early pages
of the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> where in all their humility they suggest
that theirs is just one approach. If it were then there would be a third
option and a fourth and a fifth and however many other options those helpful
people in AA can offer to the alcoholic in their quest for abstinence <i>even
if that option is abstinence by a path other than AA</i>! That option doesn't
exist inside AA. What does that tell anyone about AA and its members?

<p>
Keep up the good work!<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that is one of the standard A.A. bait-and-switch tricks, or several:
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="newwin7351">First, Bill Wilson declared that Alcoholics
Anonymous was only one of many ways to achieve sobriety, then he declared
that it was <i>The Only Way</i>.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#doctors" target="newwin7352">First, they will tell you to see a doctor, and say
that &quot;we know only a little&quot;, but then it's &quot;We know
more than doctors&quot;,
&quot;We are the experts on addictions&quot;,
and &quot;Don't take medications.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="newwin7353">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>
</ul>
<p>
What I found most outrageous was the &quot;Inventory, Step 4&quot;.
They say,
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;OBJECT: DISCLOSE DAMAGED OR UNSALEABLE GOODS&quot;.
</font>

They completely distorted
the meaning of the word &quot;inventory&quot;.  When a business does an inventory, it does not look
for the damaged, broken goods &#8212; they look for all of the good stuff, and count
it, to see how much saleable merchandise they have in the warehouse. They note in passing
the broken and damaged stuff, and write it off and send it to Goodwill for a tax
deduction. Then they count tools and equipment, and buildings and land and vehicles,
and everything of value. The only way that they can come up with
&quot;an accurate self-assessment&quot;
is by counting everything, both assets and liabilities.
But the A.A. inventory just dwells on the negatives:
bad ego, bad sex, bad instincts, bad fears, bad resentments. Nowhere do they count the assets, or
even allow the newcomer to realize that he has assets and good characteristics and
strong points.
That will mess with your mind and instill a bad inferiority complex.

<p>
I found this one interesting too:

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
SEX INSTINCT &#8212; HIDDEN &#8212; Our sex lives that are contrary to either Society,
God's principles, or our own principles.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I thought they said that A.A. is not a religion. So where, exactly, are &quot;God's principles&quot;
about sex written down in the official A.A. literature?
Not written there? Well then, how does A.A. know what God's principles about sex really are?
<p>
They can't be Bill Wilson's principles, because Bill Wilson had no principles about sex &#8212;
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="newwin7722">he was an outrageous
philanderer and sexual predator</a> who used the A.A. office to employ his string of mistresses.

<p>
Oh well, enough of that. Have a good day, and thanks again for the garbage.

Good day Terry...
<p>
Hey, I have a suggestion for an improvement to your site which
might cut down on having to continuosly repeat yourself to so many of the steppers.
As much as I love your site, it would be awesome to see the Herbert Spencer
misquote/introduction replaced, or at least include the question that no steppers
are willing to answer:
<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?

Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year sobriety
medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the steppers would actually read your
site before asking the same boring questions, but I seriously doubt that is ever
going to happen.   It's not like you haven't given it your all and they still don't
get it.

From:  	No_Name<br>
Subject:  	Thanks for educational site<br>

<p>
Especially I would like to thanks you for pointing out the heresies of
AA-cult from christian point of view. I have been in AA for some time and
somehow managed to believe it has something in common with christianity and
results were disasterous. Now I'm still struggling with these issues, I
don't anymore go to AA meetings. I talked with my confessor about AA, and he
was quite sceptical about that. He didn't deny me to go AA meetings, but
told me that I should be very cautious about that group. He also told me
that I need much willpower to overcome urge to drink. Now I really don't
think that I am sick &#8212; have disease called alcoholism. I have quitted
drinking and I used to drink too much &#8212; that doesn't make me alcoholic for
the rest of my life. If I'd have committed murder, that won't imply that I
have disease called murderomania or if I'd have committet adultery that
doesn't make me adulteromaniac, nor committing homosexual act won't make me
homosexual, nor does stealing make me cleptomaniac etc. I have sinned.

<p>
Now, should I confess my sins to Christ with my confessor or bunch of people
who have acquired false identity as alcoholics and use it as an excuse for
not having to repent? Part of the priest prayer in sacrament of
confession/repentance say that &quot;...therefore, without worrying about the
sins confessed, go in peace&quot;. That is quite contrary distorted thinking of
AA. Some people in AA say that &quot;By the grace of God, I have been released
from my urge to drink&quot;. Then they still go to AA meeting weekly and tell
stories of their past drinking behavior. Maybe that is the very reason for
people in AA relapsing more than those who quit without AA. It is better to
avoid cues for drinking (AA-meetings &amp; bars etc).

<p>
And on higher power: &quot;God as we understood him&quot;. When it comes to Bill W's
higher power, it really made me scary. According to fathers of the Church,
satan can mask himself even as a angel of light and has deceived many, even
people who have reached high level how humility and holiness, let alone
self-centered drunk in withdrawal? So, patristic teaching gives sober advice
not to trust in any visions or whatever uncommon experiences and always
discuss them with ones spiritual father. Exactly opposite what Bill W did.
He just trusted the vision he saw and started a new religion.

<p>
In AA people are told that they could pick higher power way they want, even
hold the group as their higher power. Just imagine people praying:
Group of Alcoholics, grant me the serenityTo accept the things I cannot
change;Courage to change the things I can;And wisdom to know the difference.
or

<p>
Lord, group of drunks, have mercy on me, a sinner

<p>
I have been in many many AA meetings and never heard word Jesus in these
groups. Bill W writes that Jesus was a great moral teacher, but obviously
didn't believe he was Son of God. Someone claiming that Jesus was a great
moral teacher, must be completely deluded. To quote C.S Lewis:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that
people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral
teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we
must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus
said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic &#8212; on
the level with the man who says he is a poached egg &#8212; or else he would be
the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is,
the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for
a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His
feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing
nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to
us. He did not intend to.&quot;<br>

Hello No_Name,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. You made a bunch of good points. There is no need for me to repeat them again.
<p>
Something you said that rang a bell, that I did not mention, was the idea of letting go
of the wrong after confession. &quot;Go thy way and sin no more, and don't think about it
any more either.&quot; &#8212;
<font color="black">
&quot;...therefore, without worrying about the sins confessed, go in peace&quot;. 
</font>
<p>
I was reminded of a recent letter where a woman said that people in A.A. meetings
told the same drunkalogues over and over, so many times, year after year,
that she could recite their stories as if they were her own.
Obviously, that isn't letting go of the past and getting on with your life.
That isn't recovery. And yes, it probably does contribute to the relapse rate.
If you never believe that you have changed for the better and are a different
person now, have you really changed for the better?

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. Yes, I very much want to know it. That is sad, isn't it?
<p>
TO ALL:
<p>
The author declares: &quot;Kill Them, but Don't Gas Them&quot;.
<p>
I also notice that the title, &quot;Should Canada Geese Be Gassed&quot;

&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="newwin717">Assume The Major Premise</a>&quot;.
As in,
&quot;Should they be killed by Nazi methods, or should they be killed by Christian methods?&quot;
The idea that they should be killed is assumed.

<p>
Needless to say, I'm not in sympathy with that author.
I find it sad and disgusting that some people think it is okay to kill anything that
bothers them.

I really don't understand that part of the hairless monkey species that wants
to kill everything that inconveniences it. Those hairless monkeys seem
to be both insane and very dangerous. Maybe their numbers should be culled

reservations.<br>
<br>
Now the white men want to kill the geese who get in the way of white men's
taking and using of the land and skies. And they talk about moving the
geese onto reservations.<br>
<br>
Four hundred years and nobody has learned a darned thing. They don't
even practice the Christianity that they proudly profess.<br>
<br>
Look at what they want to kill:<br>

Subject:  	The Effectiveness of The Twelve Steps<br>

<p>
I was just trying to print this very analytical and helpful article, but
the number of pages is very large.  I am referring to the one I found on
google, which is on the website,

<p>
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="newwin917">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental</a>

<p>
Is there another way to get this article?  Is it in the  bookstores?  When
was it written and who wrote it?

<p>
Thanks so much.  I am a mother whose daughter (21 Years old), insists  AA
is not for her and I was researching other programs, such as The Saint Judes
program, when I came across this article.

<p>
If I have to, I will print it from my computer, but I'd like to get it in a
more efficient way.

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Ellen K.

Hello Ellen,
<p>
That article is
<i>Treatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction</i>, published in
<i>The Harvard Mental Health Letter</i>, which is a small monthly newsletter
that is published by the Harvard Medical School.
Many libraries archive it. My local library only keeps the most recent year
of periodicals on the shelves.
They microfilm and then discard the previous years. Fortunately, I xeroxed
part 3 of that article before it went.
I also have electronic copies (web pages) of the whole article.
The whole article was published in
three pieces, in Aug. (Part I), Sept. (Part II), and Oct. 1995 (Part III).

<p>
Most of my files are still in a storage locker, but when I 
finish getting moved in to my new home, I'll find it and send you a copy,
if you haven't already gotten it.
That article sounds like one that I should put online. You are the second person
who asked for a copy. I'll have to see if I can get permission from Harvard.

<p>
Have a good day now.

P.S.: I found it. Here is a zip file that contains all three parts:
<a href="HMHL_addictions.zip">HMHL_addictions.zip</a><br>
Be sure to unzip it with subdirectories (folders) recreated, because the pages are structured with
the pieces (graphics, style sheets) placed in appropriate subdirectories.
