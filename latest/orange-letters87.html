Orange,

<p>
Thanks for the recent email; much appreciated. Things are indeed changing...

<p>
On the above link you will see a video I have made regarding the
similarities between AA and pyramid schemes, or multilevel marketing. The
comparison seems more wanted that one might assume.

<p>
I would be interested in hearing from the visitors of your website who have
been involved in both AA and pyramid schemes.

<p>
Many thanks.

<p>
Rick,

<p>
I saw you on the BBC Panorama program aired recently in the UK. I know we
have not always seen eye to eye in terms of the AA debate, but I wanted to
say that I was horrified to hear about the PDF file that Scientology had
produced on you. It also led me to conclude that much of what has been
written about you on the Wikipedia entry for your name stems from that file.
(A file that I would encourage Orange to scrutinise and remove from his
links page if he can establish any unfair bias.)

<p>
Although I believe AA can harm people and despite the fact you disagree with
me on that point, I certainly do not advocate the kind of tactics that have
been used to belittle your word, and your knowledge, on the subject of
cults. I prefer to hear the points people have to make and judge those
points on there merit, and not on whatever mistakes the person may or may
not have made. For what it is worth I think you came across very well in the
program, and I think you have a tremendous amount of courage for tackling
all the organisations that you do.

<p>
I would also like to add that I am saddened that you believe many of the
people who side with the anti AA fanatics have flamed your board, and used
tactics that you would normally associate with the cults that you
investigate. I have for a long time been calling for a proper, decent and
civilised debate on the merits of AA's efficacy. It is not an easy task to
achieve when you have such a polarisation of views, and I have witnessed
first hand how easily the debate descends into a war that employs the use of
ad hominems.

<p>
In all honesty, and despite my attempts to mask my motives, I am writing
this email with the hopes of achieving an aim; I would request your
participation in a debate with Agent Orange on the question of whether AA is
a cult or not, that I would host on my site. Although that notion might not
appear appealing to you in the first instance, I must point out that the
only motivation for my participation in this debate has been with the hope
of learning, not proving. There is a fine line, and indeed a subtle
difference, between those two objectives. I do not hide the fact that I
believe AA can cause more problems than it solves for many people, but one
question I have always reserved judgment on is the one of whether AA is a
cult or not.  If the aim is to learn, then it is hard to make such claims
that AA is a cult without hearing the points offered from both sides of the
debate, and perhaps more importantly in this scenario, from learned,
researched and well intentioned persons.  I think both Agent Orange and
yourself fit the aforementioned criteria.

<p>
I know that you have answered this point within your forums, but what this
opportunity might afford is a chance for viewers to have the questions posed
and thus answered in one sphere without having to trudge your forum.

<p>
Finally, I humbly request that you make an effort to separate those that
serve an appetite to prove, and instead make your expertise in this field
useful to the people that are driven by something far more productive, and
that is a of course a desire to learn. At the risk of sounding holier than
thou, I might assume it was this very drive in you that resulted in the
establishment of the Rick Ross Institute.  The question is often more
revealing than the answer; is it not?

<p>
It would be a lazy mind that reached the conclusion I have never challenged
Orange; indeed I have; I am not here to make friends, I am here to alleviate
any ignorance that might allow me to achieve easy conclusions ? and to echo
the above, my hunger to learn. If you are in any doubt about those
sentiments a quick online search will reveal how many supporters I have lost
because I refuse to promote a cause without thorough investigation.

<p>
Whether you choose to engage in this debate or not, I applaud your efforts.
What intrigues me about you is the fact that so many of the visitors to my
site support your efforts despite how much you appear to disagree with our
views on AA. I don't regard that as a threat; but as an opportunity.

<p>
In keeping with my desire to keep this debate open I have sent this email to
Agent Orange.

<p>
I look forward to your response.

<p>
Kind regards,

<p>
J a m e s  G

<p>
PS And just as I have stated Agent Orange might be wrong to rely on the
Wikipedia entry about you, I would also state that awarding him a flame
medal might also be an error.

         The Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction
 Equity Act (H.R. 1424)
 is the most important addiction-related legislation
 that Congress has considered in over a decade.
<p>
 We must act now!
<p>
 Ensuring that all Americans have fair access to
 addiction treatment
 is top legislative priority. The Paul Wellstone
 parity bill is a
 crucial step towards this goal. The bill says the
 following:
<p>
 An insurance plan must provide the same benefits
 (co-pays,
 co-insurance, deductibles, etc.) to patients seeking
 mental health or
 addiction treatment that it provides for
 medical/surgical treatment.
 Insurance plans may not impose different treatment
 limitations (number
 of visits, frequency of visits, etc.) on mental
 health or addiction
 coverage than the limitations for medical/surgical
 treatment. If an
 insurance plan provides out-of-network coverage for
 medical/surgical
 care, it must provide the same level of
 out-of-network coverage for
 mental health and addiction treatment. The bill does
 not preempt state
 laws that guarantee stronger parity protection.Over
 250 Members of
 Congress have co-sponsored the parity bill so far.
 Please send your
 Representative an e-mail now to either thank them
 for their support or
 urge them to co-sponsor the bill. When you enter

Hi John,
<p>
I'm going to have to put together another web page for people to use to email their Senators
and Congresspersons about this. Right now, I ask people to call or write their representatives
and object to this legislation on the basis that it merely rewards and promotes quackery.
<p>
Something that I have been stressing and requesting is TESTING of drug and alcoholism treatment
programs. There is no reason that the government or health insurance companies should have
to pay for ineffective quackery. The FDA should be testing treatments the same way as
they test drugs &#8212; with
<a href="orange-letters26.html#Randomized_Longitudinal">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>.
(I understand that the FDA does not currently test medical treatments. They should.)

<p>
I am all for
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160701051256/http://www.behaviortherapy.com/ResearchDiv/whatworks.aspx" target="newwin99">drug and alcohol
rehab treatment that actually works</a>,
but the 12-Step treatment does not work
at all, and never has. Alcoholics Anonymous has
failed every valid medical test of its effectiveness.
And yet, 12-Step nonsense is the treatment program in 93% of the treatment centers in the USA.
<p>
This fact should be stressed to the Senators and Congresspersons.
<p>
I would recommend to the Senators and Congresspersons that no one should have to pay for treatment
which has not been proven to be effective. Neither we the taxpayers, nor we the patients,
nor we the health insurance buyers, should have to pay for fraud and quackery.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

HI Orange,
<p>
Midtown AA is not that unusual. I have left AA and now follow
my own inner guidance. I was very active for many years and found lots of
cultish behavior and control.
<p>
There is a group in Los Angeles that is very
Cult-like. The group is called the Pacific Group. The leader Clancy is
getting older now I don't know if he is still @ it, but for years the
women complained about his sexual misconduct and financial
exploitation. He controlled members in all areas of their lives. He had
people show up on Sat.  and pick up trash in his yard. It was his way or
no way.
<p>
Because I know how vicious some AA members can be, please do not
give my name on your site. I am many years sober and intend to stay that
way. The pacific group used to say you had to stay in their group to stay
sober. Lots of very sick dogma.

Hi Anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, I've been hearing things about the Pacific Group too, and I'd
like to learn more.
<p>
What is unusual about the Midtown Group is that they have managed to get into so much
trouble that they have made the big time, and are being reported on in Newsweek magazine and
on NBC4 TV. I hope that we see more of this new openness and accuracy in reporting.

You know bro. I'm glad I'm not in your head...Thats why I stay in the rooms &#8212; so I

heart is all I can ask for. If you want to do something positive it usually doesnt
start with a negative. Yeah I know simple simple &#8212; but hell, you are putting a lot of
effort into something that isn't even that important...it's totally bizarre and

lot like I did when I stopped going to meeting for a couple of years. Life still
happens no matter what. People go out and it hurts. My friends might not be alive if
they weren't back in the rooms. For now that is. I won't even try to compete with
you intellectually. It's a spiritual program, right? I don't see anything about

<p>
So &quot;the rooms&quot; teach you to be open-minded, and honestly consider what the critics of 
Alcoholics Anonymous are saying? I don't think so.
<p>
You are going to &quot;stay in the rooms&quot;? What a tragic waste of time. Why don't you get out and live?

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;If you want to do something positive it usually doesnt start with a negative.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Oh really? Let's see...
<ul>
<li> Martin Luther nailing his complaints on the church door...<br>
<li> Jesus Christ whipping the money-changers from the temple...<br>
<li> Abraham Lincoln waging war against the South, and freeing the slaves....<br>
<li> The founding fathers of the U.S.A. rebelling and fighting against British tyranny...<br>
</ul>
<p>
Would we have been better off if those people weren't so &quot;negative&quot; and hadn't begun
their work by being negative?


<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;but hell, you are putting a lot of effort into something that isn't even that important...&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
What? Telling the truth about addictions, alcoholism and recovery isn't important?
By your own logic then, A.A., A.A. meetings, and the <i>Big Book</i>
aren't very important either, are they?
You imagine that they tell the truth about alcoholism, but that isn't &quot;important&quot;...

<p>
What you are illustrating now is the propaganda and debating technique called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">Minimization and Denial</a>&quot;.
A.A. members often claim that alcoholics are very good at using that technique, usually
to claim that they don't really need to quit drinking or quit smoking.
But they also use it to minimize the bad parts of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Life still happens no matter what.&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Well yeh, but that's just another slogan. What does that have to do with the benefits to
be gained from joining a dishonest cult religion that claims to cure or treat things that it
doesn't?

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;People go out and it hurts.&quot;

<p>
Prove it. Show me any valid study that shows that participation in A.A. is better than
quitting on your own, alone, or by going to another program,
or another group like SMART or SOS or WFS. &#8212;That means a real valid fair test, a

<i>Brief Interventions</i>, and it got a positive score of 390. A.A. got a negative score,
MINUS 82, way below zero.

You don't really know what alternate realities could have occurred in other time-lines.

<p>
Wrong. There is nothing spiritual about lying to sick people about how well a suggested
course of treatment really works. And yet you begin every A.A. meeting by incanting the
lies of Bill Wilson:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
And the 12 Steps are not spiritual, they are superstitious practices that Bill Wilson copied from
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult</a>.
Frank Buchman created those practices for recruiting and indoctrinating cult members.

<p>
That's the normal order for geese: The father leads, the goslings follow, and then the mother
brings up the rear, urging the stragglers along.

The gosling front and center is the oldest,

He is already getting his adult feathers, and his neck is turning black and his cheeks are
turning white. And the testosterone is taking affect. He shows all of the signs of growing
into a big alpha male. Already, he just has to push forwards, and take the lead, even from his
own father.

From:  	&quot;brent p.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	your opinions on Tiebout &amp; AA<br>

<p>

I suspect this is pointless but, what the heck. What is your problem dude?
AA is not a cult. Neither is it a religion by any definition I know of.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Brent,
<p>
Yes, A.A. is a cult. That is a FACT, not an OPINION.
The evidence is overwhelming. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>.
<p>
And A.A. is a religion, too.
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges">
Several United States District Court judges have ruled on that</a>, and they all agreed that
Alcoholics Anonymous engages in religious activities, and that A.A. meetings are religious
services.
<p>
A religion does not stop being a religion just because somebody incants,
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html">It's Spiritual, Not Religious</a>&quot;.

</font>
<p>

Brainwashing? Hardly, although many in AA would readily admit to needing at
least a good brain dusting &#8212; a clearing out of the cobwebs if you like.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again,
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">check the facts</a>.
A.A. meets all of the criteria for a good brainwashing program.
A.A. fits the descriptions of brainwashing programs that were written by
Dr. Robert J. Lifton, Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer, and Dr. Edgar H. Schein.

</font>
<p>

Angry, anti-AA people like you astonish me. Show me the harm AA has done.
The real harm. The shattered lives it has produced. The homeless it has
created. The disenfranchised. Show me how AA lures unsuspecting winos into
its fold then turns them into glassy eyed sycophantic adherents.

I've been a member for twenty five years and can say with complete and utter
candor that I never did anything in AA that I didn't want to do. In fact I
am continually reminded that how I practise (or don't) the steps in my life
is entirely up to me. I continue to be impressed by the real democracy of
the organization (and I use the word organization loosely). I think the
thing that pisses people like you off is the simple fact that AA really does
nothing much of anything except hold meetings for people who have discovered
that, when facing a problem like alcoholism, there is strength in numbers.
No big whup. No conspiracy. No brainwashing. No secret plot to poison the
well water. Relax pal. Have a drink.

Cheers, Brent P.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thank you for the recommendation that I have a drink. You just proved that Alcoholics Anonymous is
a cult that is more concerned with its own appearance than with the welfare of alcoholics.
<p>
Have a good day anyway. And don't take a drink, no matter what.
<p>
Oh, and guess what important fact is missing from your praise of Alcoholics Anonymous?<br>
What elephant in the living room are you blissfully ignoring?<br>
<p>
You didn't talk about how well Alcoholics Anonymous really works to make alcoholics stop drinking.

<p>

No matter how you cut it AA does work. And well. There were tons of
inconsistencies in the life of Bill W.       Contradictions in the program its
self. Nonetheless I have 5 examples of AAs effectiveness for everyone of your
muddled assertions.<br>
Truely you are uneducated in this.<br>
Lighten up<br>
Gary N<br>

Hello Gary,
<p>
Well, let's see your facts. You claim that A.A. works, and well. So show me the evidence.

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">What is the real A.A. success rate</a>?<br>

<p>
Not very many, right?<br>
</font>
</center>
<p>
<a href="orange-letters88.html#success_rate">The answers are here</a>.
<p>
You claim to have 5 success stories? (per assertion...)<br>
Is that all? And how many dozens or hundreds of
A.A. failures were there at the same time?<br>
Giving one number without the other, the count of A.A. successes without the count of failures, is meaningless.

<p>
And then you do a little
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>
tap-dance about Bill Wilson.
Bill's life wasn't inconsistent. He was very consistently a criminal, a fraud, a con artist,
a cult leader,
a sexual predator, and a compulsive liar. He founded a cult and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">made a bunch of money off of it</a>.
And he used A.A. meetings as
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">
meat markets for his next sexual conquest</a>.
There was nothing inconsistent about Bill Wilson's behavior.

<p>
Have a good day.

I've been sober for 5 years now but I found myself placing distance with
other's and the entire AA sect about 3 years ago. I felt it was very cultish
and I was sick of guru's with more time speaking as if they were sitting
high atop the clouds. Your papers captures what I've seen and know to be
true, very good work.

<p>

Thanks

PS. I feel better since stepping into the world and away from the dogma.
