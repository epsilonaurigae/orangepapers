Subject:  	...another letter<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I just happened upon your site while researching AA links.

<p>
I've only been attending AA for a couple of months now (am certainly no expert) &#8212;  but
I thought I'd write to say that many of the &quot;cons&quot; I read at orange-papers are off
the mark from what I've experienced.

<p>
The group of folks I attend with don't do anything other than to tell their tales
and to offer support through their own experiences. There's no pressure to buy
anything at all &#8212;  some literature is for sale but it's just placed out for those who
wish to own it. All donations are voluntary &#8212;  sometimes I have a couple of bucks on
me, sometimes not. I like to at least help to defray the costs of drinks/snacks that
are brought in for all to share.

<p>
There's never a feeling that if you fail (drink again) you ought not return &#8212;  quite
the contrary. It's human nature to get into any bad habit and it isn't going to go
away instantly. But, eventually, a decision has to be made whether the continued
drinking and it's dire consequences are more attractive than to simply give up
alcohol entirely. No other person is going to decide that for you.

<p>
As for the &quot;indoctrination&quot; aspect &#8212;  well, I've not seen that either. God is not
thrust down anyone's throat &#8212;  reference to a &quot;higher power, as I understand it&quot; can
mean reaching out to other AA'ers when you're feeling down and wanting to reach for
a drink. I've never been lead to believe that I &quot;must&quot; come back, for all of
eternity, to meetings. It's an offer of support if you need it, anytime, no
questions asked.

<p>
With regards to honesty &#8212;  what I get from what I've heard so far is that as long as
your brain sits in an alcohol stew, you're pretty much dead in the water. If AA can
get you off of drinking, even for a short time, you at least have a much better shot
at evaluating your options then. With the alcohol gone from the picture, you lose
the excuses that your problems all come from the drinking. Obviously, they don't
(which is why they say &quot;abstaining is not going to solve all of the other issues in
your life&quot;)  &#8212; but the drinker is now, and perhaps for the first time in a while,
forced to examine and to address their life from a sober standpoint. No running
away/numbing with drink &#8212;  but a sober and honest assessment of how things have become
and taking personal responsibility to get things straightened out. It's a scary
proposition when you've been self-medicating for so long.

<p>
My group has never insisted AA was the answer &#8212; only that it's something to try, and
if it's not for you, then it's not for you. The point of sharing stories (bad and
good) is to show that you're not alone, that alcohol is destructive for some people,
and then that there are success stories. Will some of the long-term abstainers
someday drink again? Maybe...but that's part of being human. The few I've seen at
meetings (after a relapse) were treated with compassion and kindness and welcomed
back.

<p>
As with all things, you get from it what you wish to. Every program (including
religions) have very few &quot;to the letter&quot; believers/practitioners. They find their
own personal truths by reading between the lines. I'm not counting on AA to save my
life &#8212;  I'm seeking an answer to a problem, and I welcome the support as I do so. For
me, it's been helpful.

<p>
Regards,

<p>
Tracy
<p>
PS &#8212;  there's a lot of bitterness in this world towards a &quot;divine creator&quot; or God &#8212;  and
why so much suffering should be allowed. My take is that we're not puppets on a
string &#8212;  but help is there for the asking, if you wish to consider the possibility
that we're pretty simple-minded beings and we don't &quot;know-it-all&quot;. Off of
alcohol/since AA, I'm now much more aware and forgiving of my imperfections and I've
learned to cut myself a lot of slack. I'll never be perfect, but I'll keep looking
to improve...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tracy,
<p>
It is good (and lucky) that you found a group that you like, rather than one that
exploited and abused you (like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the Midtown Group</a>,
or
<a href="orange-letters87.html#Pacific" target="_blank">the Pacific Group</a>).
<p>
But I do not at all agree with your attitude that we are all just simple-minded
beings who need a boss to supervise us and tell us how to live.

<p>
This is just a repetition of the standard A.A. stereotype of
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the disgusting alcoholic</a>&quot;:
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;...but the drinker is now, and perhaps for the first time in a while,
forced to examine and to address their life from a sober standpoint.
No running away/numbing with drink &#8212; but a sober and honest
assessment of how things have become and taking personal responsibility
to get things straightened out.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
A.A. claims that it wants to reduce the stigma and shame of alcoholism, but
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">they actually work
to increase the shame and stigma</a> by constantly describing alcoholics
like that.
<p>
And the fact remains that the 12-Step practices are actually very
psychologically harmful and depressing and even drive people to suicide.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Hello,

<p>
I was looking thru your wish list and I think I may have found something
to help.

<p>
You asked for..

<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Somebody did a study that found that they could pay alcoholics not to
drink. They also found that they could pay alcoholics in programs with
tokens that would buy a drink. The alcoholics were allowed to cash in
their chips and drink any evening that they chose. Some of the
alcoholics chose to save up their tokens so that they could really party
hearty on Saturday night.<br>
If alcoholics were really powerless over alcohol, then that should not
have happened. The alcoholics showed a lot of control over their
drinking habits.<br>
So the question is, what was that study? When, where, who?&quot;

<p>
I found this...

<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

The idea of a single disease obscures the scientific consensus that no
single cause has ever been established, nor has any biological causal
factor ever been shown to be decisive. Heavy drinking has many causes
which vary from drinker to drinker, from one drinking pattern to
another. Character, motivation, family environment, personal history,
ethnic and cultural values, marital, occupational, and educational
status all play a role. As these change, so do patterns of drinking,
heavy drinking, and &quot;alcoholism&quot; (Fingarette, 1989). For example,
alcohol is used in many so-called &quot;primitive&quot; societies, but their
drinking patterns are not ours, and what we can alcoholism seems to be
absent prior to contact with Europeans (Heath, 1989). That would not be
true if alcoholism was a disease caused by chemical and neurological
effects of drinking in conjunction with individual genetic
vulnerability. The crucial role of psychology in alcoholics' drinking is
demonstrated by experiments in which they are deceived about whether the
beverage they are drinking contains alcohol. Their drinking patterns
then reflect their beliefs; the actual presence or absence of alcohol is
irrelevant (Marlatt et al., 1973).

Alcoholics do not &quot;lack control&quot; in the ordinary sense of those words.
Studies show that they can limit their drinking in response to appeals
and arguments or rules and regulations. In experiments they will reduce
or eliminate drinking in return for money, social privileges, or
exemption from boring tasks (Fingarette, 1989).

Fingarette's book should have a source for this statement about the
control of drinking given rewards...

Hello Sandy,

Actually, I'm pretty satisfied with life. I might be a little more satisfied
if I were to win the lottery or attain instant Zen,
but until then, yes, you can help. You can join the struggle against evil

Nope, not an atheist. I just don't believe in Santa Claus.
<p>

One of the big problems that I have with Alcoholics Anonymous philosophy is
that it teaches Santa Claus spirituality &#8212; Santa Claus or &quot;Higher Power&quot; will
come and give you a bunch of stuff, but only if you are good.
<p>
I think the Jews in Auschwitz and the children in Bangladesh finally answered that
question for once and for all &#8212; praying to get the goodies is foolish
and doesn't work.
<p>
But
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Santa_Claus" target="_blank">
the whole 12-Step program depends on &quot;Higher Power&quot; constantly doing
things for people</a>
&#8212; things that they are supposedly powerless to accomplish
themselves, like make them quit drinking, and restore them to sanity, and remove
their defects and give them power.  And that's why the 12-Step program does not work.
<p>
There is also the theological problem of God's Divine Plan. If people can get
God to change His mind and do something different just because people beg Him
in prayer, then there is no Divine Plan and God doesn't know what He is going
to do next.
<p>
So does God have any Divine Plan? If so, then what are some A.A. members doing
bothering God to change the Plan to please them?

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
I don't know your name, but I feel like I know you.  The work you have
put toward exposing AA for what it is is worth a Pulitzer Prize.  I am
a well-educated 43 year old professional.  I was diagnosed as an
alcoholic at age 14.  My life has been riddled with attempts to
&quot;recover&quot;.  I won't go in to all of the gory details about my path to
writing this email, but I just finished reading Emmet Fox's &quot;Sermon on
the Mount&quot;.  I believe if Emmet were alive today and knew AA was
crediting him for his contribution to the now known program of
Alcoholics Anonymous, he would have a few things to say about the
error of the 12 steps and the central theme of powerlessness. I was
given the book by a member of AA &#8212; it is clear he never read it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tim,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
About Emmet Fox &#8212; one of the oddest things about A.A. is how they get away
with claiming to be Christian, or &quot;compatible with Christianity&quot;,
or &quot;based on Christianity&quot;,
while teaching a philosophy that has nothing to do with Christianity, and
<a href="orange-heresy.html">is often very much the opposite of Christian
philosophy</a>.  Apparently, all that anyone has to do to pass for Christian
is just yammer the words Jesus, Christ, and Christian a few times.
<p>
But that is actually an old con:
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#1CCF" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman used the same trick</a>
with
his cult religion. He originally named it &quot;First Century Christian Fellowship&quot;,
but calling it Christian was just window dressing. There was nothing Christian about his
strange occult religion for the rich that was effusive in praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
Still, Buchman insisted that his philosophy was compatible with all Christian
churches.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous, the child of Buchman's groups,
is just continuing the same beliefs and practices.
</font>
<p>
I just wanted to say thank you for what you are doing.  I feel a sense
of freedom and power beyond description.  I must also admit I am still
fighting off the 30 years of AA programming.  I have an idea and I was
hoping for some guidance and support.  As you often state, little of
what you provide in your writing is &quot;new&quot;, I am considering borrowing
on a recent concept.  I'd like to start a blog covering a year of my
life without AA in a similar fashion to Julie and Julia &#8212; the recent
movie about Julia Child.  I would also like to stay in touch with you
through the process, but I am sure you are just overwhelmed with
attempts like mine to communicate.  Anyway, I will keep you posted on
my progress.  I would also, like your permission to borrow some of the
content of your site as I deal publicly with central themes of AA like
Powerlessness, the &quot;Disease Concept&quot;, The real Bill Wilson, etc..
Would this be OK?  Do I need to get your approval each time or can I
just credit you as required?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sure, have fun. Just go for it. The truth is, most of my material comes from
other sources anyway.

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Again I want to encourage you to continue to offer another
perspective on the 12 programs. I found so many in AA lacking
integrity. One thing that might have contributed was the practice of
calling out &quot;but are you sober&quot;? after someone has shared some
horrendous act they  had  participated in recently. The self obsession of
continued talking about oneself cannot be good for character building.
<p>
Sherwoode

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sherwood,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yeh, I agree.
<p>
I am reminded of something that I heard at an N.A. meeting.
A young woman told the story of being in a restaurant, and another woman at
a nearby booth went to the bathroom and left her purse on the seat, so this
woman grabbed it and made a run for it, and got out of there and
took the purse to the apartment of some junkie friends. The junkies
went through the purse, inventorying everything. They figured that they
could use the credit cards in scams, and the I.D. was useful too. And they
were debating whether to go back to the restaurant, or to the victim's house,
and steal her car, since they had her address and the car keys.
<p>
Then the woman who told this story was saying, &quot;But I didn't use.&quot; She was
talking about how hard it was to abstain from using drugs, since she could have
gotten some right then and there. But she was happy that she did not accept any
drugs through the whole thing.
<p>
I was a bit surprised and appalled at the brain-damaged logic and lack of
ethics. If she had just not stolen the woman's purse in the first place, then she
wouldn't have had any reason to go to the home of her junkie friends, so
she wouldn't have had any difficulty abstaining from drugs.
<p>
Of course, nobody said a word of criticism. That is &quot;cross-talk&quot;, and that
is forbidden. It's also &quot;taking someone else's inventory&quot;, which is also
forbidden.

<p>
Yeh, well I &quot;took her inventory&quot; and decided right then and there that I didn't
want to have anything to do with her or her junkie friends.
<p>
So how is that a &quot;spiritual&quot; program? How is it that so many crimes,
ranging from purse-snatching to statutory rape and sexual abuse, are okay, as
long as you don't drink or dope while you do it?
<p>
Sometimes it appears that sobriety is a virtue for people who have no others.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the link. That web page is really something else. Talk about somebody being in denial.
About all that I can say is, after she gets done with all of her word games,
and playing with the definitions of &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;religious&quot;, she completely
ignores the negative aspects of cults. She actually declares that cults
are okay because they are just religious groups?
<font color="#4f007f">
&#8212; &quot;a cult is a system of belief in, and reverence for, a deity; where customary or regular procedures are practiced.&quot;
</font>
<p>
By her logic, the
religious groups established by Jim Jones, David Koresh, Luc Jouret,
Shoko Asahara, and Marshall Herff Applewhite are really okay, and they
never harmed anybody. The dictionary says so.

<p>
Then the rationalization that alcoholics and drug users are
already engaging in rituals with rules,
so the rituals and rules of A.A. are okay,
is some really brain-damaged logic. But that is actually very similar to
Bill Wilson's crazy argument that we should have faith in his
religion because we had already believed in the
&quot;higher powers&quot; of logic, Reason (with a capitol 'R'),
and human intelligence:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge
of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason
had brought us so far.  But somehow we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and
did not like to lose our support.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That was natural, but let us think a little more closely.
Without knowing it, had we not been brought to where we stood
by a certain kind of faith? For did we not believe in our own
reasoning? Did we not have confidence in our ability to think?
What was that but a sort of faith? Yes, we had been faithful,
abjectly faithful to the God of Reason. So, in one way or another,
we discovered that faith had been involved all the time!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We found, too, that we had been worshippers.
... Had we not variously worshipped people, sentiment, things,
money, and ourselves? ... In one form or
another we had been living by faith and little else.<br>

<p>
So, Bill Wilson concluded, it was okay for the non-believers to join his religion
and have faith in and worship his &quot;Higher Power&quot;.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	coerced by courts<br>

<p>
Hi orange, i just finished reading &quot;<a name="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">spiritual not religious</a>&quot;. I have an
observation, as i am newly free of AA and been thru the whole treatment trip.
The many courts and the highest court in the country have found it to be
unconstitutional to make AA/NA a condition of parole..... but oh boy is no one
following that law. It is against the Constitution BUT addicts and alcoholics in this
State (Hawai`i) are regularly and routinely sent to 12-step rehabs and &quot;sober&quot;
houses to keep their children or avoid jail, and to keep from being thrown out on
the street. The people who claim that addiction is a chronic, progressive disease are
punishing the victims (or patients) for their relapses. Could it be that they know it
is not really a disease? I think so.
<p>
Over half the people 'in the rooms' today are only there to get
their court papers signed and/or papers signed for verification for their 'clean and
sober house'. When the only alternative to AA is jail or homelessness, well, you
know. And most of these people go to AA instead of NA because it's easier to find a
meeting, even though their problem is ice, not alcohol, which is perfectly fine
since it is the same 12 steps that solve everyone's problems.
<p>
Anyway, have a good day.  
<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello Ted,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. My observations agree with yours. I was shoved into meetings
by a so-called
&quot;<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">treatment program</a>&quot;,
as a condition of getting housing so that I would not be homeless.
I remember one meeting where every single person in the room, except for the group
secretary, had a piece of paper to get signed.  That is one heck of a program
of &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot;.

<p>
The issue of punishing people who relapse is an important point. If
alcoholism and addiction are really diseases, then the authorities have no
business punishing people for relapses. It's just as unfair as punishing somebody
whose cancer comes back.  But the &quot;program managers&quot; do punish the relapsers,
saying something like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He chose to use. He chose to indulge. Now he has to suffer the consequences.&quot;
</font>
What they are
revealing is that they don't believe in the disease theory at all.
By their actions, they are clearly declaring that addiction is a choice, not a disease.

<p>
But, in their usual dishonesty, the treatment centers still yammer,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's a terrible disease. Give us
more money to treat this awful disease that afflicts so many.&quot;

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear Terrance,
<p>
    I was recently referred to you by Dennis M.  I, like Dennis M.,
was raised up in a 12-step home and then put into rehabs and 12-step
programs at a young age.  My story is very similar to Dennis' story, in
fact.  My family is still very 'hooked' on the 12-steps and the influence
it has had on my parents, brothers, and self is astounding.
<p>
    I am in the process of writing a couple of books on the phenomena of
growing up in the 12-steps, both as a member and as a child of parents in
12-steps.  One of my books is going to be a collection of stories from
others who have gone through similar experiences.  While I have found a
few
contributors already, I would like several more.  I know you are very
tapped
into an online network of current and ex-12-step members.  Would you mind
if
I use you and/or your website as a way to help get more stories?  These
do
not need to be beautifully written stories, the raw information is
enough.
Some will be given their own chapters and others will be used to
influence
my summaries and writings.
<p>
     I would be happy to provide more information and discuss this
further
if you are interested.
<p>

Subject:  	Day 7 smoke-free<br>

<p>
AO &#8212; Good news to report.  I've been &quot;smo-ber&quot; for seven days.  I'm
using nicotine patches, which have taken a huge edge off of the
withdrawl, but I still get the cold sweats and 15 minute intervals of
&quot;obsession to smoke&quot;.  I've made some big changes &#8212; This is what I was
like

<p>
here's what I look and feel like now.

<p>
All kidding aside, I appreciate your encouragement.  I'll tell you, it
REALLY helps to get support, true empathy, and encouragement from people
(such as yourself and other friends) who have gone through the same
Hell.  I'm well into week 2 now.

<p>
I'll be passing through Central Oregon to Tri-Cities on Thursday &#8212; I'll
wave toward your way when I'm there.

Hi again, Eric,
<p>
Congratulations!
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and breaking free.
You are through the physical withdrawal, and now the mind games begin.
I recommend reading the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>
again (and again), especially that list of things that old lizard brain
will say to try to get you to smoke a cigarette.

<p>
Old lizard brain's yammering and jabbering about the joys of smoking
was really intense for the first few months, and then slowly faded out, but I still got
occasional thoughts about grabbing a cigarette even years later.
Fortunately, such thoughts are easy to over-ride, because they are just thoughts,
after all, and it only takes about five seconds of clear thinking to remember
what a pain smoking really was &#8212; not fun at all.
<p>
Again, this slogan comes in handy: &quot;Play the tape to the end.&quot;
Thinking about smoking one cigarette leads very quickly to pictures of
coughing and being sick and in pain, and hooked again.
No fun. I think I'll do something else.

<p>
So have a good life.

Hi Orange, I hope I find you well.

<p>
I applaud your dedication in exposing the cult of A.A for what it is, and
have found that your experiences (and those of your many email
contributors), exactly match those of my own. I do sometimes question why
you seem to hammer home the same points over and over again, but then I
realise that that's exactly what the &quot;steppers&quot; do with their endless
slogans and their insane, twisted logic. Perhaps yours is the only way to
get the truth out, so keep up the good work. If you stop just one person from
falling prey to these nut cases, then you have justified your time on this
earth.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Andy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Another reason for the repetition is because the proponents of Steppism just don't
get it. They keep asking the same questions over and over, and ignoring the answers,
and making the same untrue statements over and over. Just a few letters back
it was,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Why knock something which has helped so many?&quot;
</font>
I can't count how many times
another Stepper has said essentially the same thing.
Apparently, they just think in slogans.

</font>
<p>
Your motivation to fight as hard as you do seems &#8212; at least in part &#8212; to be
due to the fact that in your country, many people are forced to go to A.A.
You seem (rightly) to be angry that this quackery is paid for with public
money. This isn't quite the case in the UK, so perhaps this is why I haven't
got as angry as you, but since we often follow US culture here in Britain,
perhaps it's only a matter of time before it also happens here. Many
messed-up people who end up in front of our justice system do pledge to
attend A.A. and can often avoid jail by volunteering to do so. To my
knowledge this cannot (yet) be ordered by a court in the UK, but perhaps
that is how it started in the US.???

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. Watch out for the slogan, &quot;Treatment works!&quot;  The next thing you know,
the courts are sentencing people to &quot;treatment&quot; (for their own good,
of course). Then &quot;treatment&quot; is defined
as going to 3 A.A. meetings per week, or even one every day.
</font>
<p>
With regards to meetings, I have personally witnessed many of the things you
and others speak of during my visits to A.A., and have seen many examples of
everything from dangerous amateur psychology, control-freak sponsors,
bullying and of course &quot;thirteenth stepping&quot; &#8212; which I assure you that men
can be the victims of too.

<p>
In my case, this manifested itself in suggestions of intimacy from a woman
who seemed genuine when she first befriended me. She was older than me, had
been sober for a year or so, and was a very attractive lady.

<p>
I found out just in time that her overtures toward me were simply because
she needed money to prevent her mortgage company taking possession of her
house. In my vulnerable state I had not suspected her real agenda, but
thankfully I confided in my father and he saw through her very quickly. His
advice on how she answered certain questions that he prompted me to ask her
was the only thing that saved me from losing some serious money. I wised-up
fairly quickly after that.

<p>
At the about the same time, I was heavily pressured to find myself a
sponsor. Being desperate to beat the demon drink (and erroneously viewing my
new &quot;friends&quot; as experts) I complied, and approached a man who was
recommended to me by many in the group (including the lady I mentioned
previously) to become my sponsor. The alarm bells started ringing soon after
he agreed to be my sponsor. His acceptance of the role depended on me
agreeing to do EXACTLY as he said. This included me agreeing that I was not
to form a romantic relationship with a member of the opposite sex until I
had been sober for a period of two years.

<p>
Now I may have been a piss-head, but I was still a red-blooded bloke, so I
naturally objected to this. I asked him to show me exactly where this
requirement of celibacy was referred to in the 12 steps, or indeed anywhere
in the &quot;Big Book&quot; &#8212; which of course he couldn't, because it wasn't.

<p>
After considering his kind offer, I told him to piss off!!!

<p>
A few days later I was invited via telephone to the house of the lady I
mentioned earlier for a &quot;cup of tea and a chat.&quot;

<p>
Following the cup of tea, there was a knock at the door and my prospective
sponsor and a few of his cronies were the persons doing the knocking. The
lady of the house invited them in, and they spent the next few hours trying
every trick in the book to get me to bend to their will. Thankfully, at
around 2am, I stood up, told them all (in very unambiguous terms) what I
thought of them, and left the house.

<p>
Since that night, I have not attended, and WILL NOT EVER attend an A.A.
meeting again.

<p>
I have not spoken of these things until now &#8212; the main reason being that the
meetings I attended always ended with a statement by the chairman that &quot;what
is said in these rooms, stays in these rooms.&quot;  &#8212; I took this solemn
proclamation very seriously.

<p>
But then I guess that in retrospect, that pledge we all made was similar in
nature to the victim of a paedophile agreeing not to say anything about what
their abuser did to them.

<p>
I would also suggest to you (and your readers) that this &quot;stays in these
rooms&quot; statement is not (as it first seems) an honourable way of protecting
the anonymity of the members of A.A., but is simply further evidence of the
behaviour of an insidious cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I agree. They imply that the confidentiality is like medical confidentiality,
where a psychologist or psychiatrist will not reveal what you say to him in
counseling sessions, but A.A. is not medicine.  A.A. is also not the Confessional
of the Catholic Church.
<p>
Often, the confidentiality of 12-Step meetings just
allows con artists to continue running their scams.
Nobody outside of A.A., or even in another meeting, ever hears what they are doing.
For 20 years, nobody outside of A.A. heard how
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the Midtown Group</a>
was really a sexual exploitation society.
<p>
The anonymity helps there too. I am reminded of the criminal who went to A.A.
meetings and picked up lonely middle-aged women, and became their lover &#8212; even
marrying them. Then he took everything they had &#8212; their life savings, their bank
accounts, and retirement funds. Then he mortgaged their houses to the hilt
and took the money. And then he disappeared,
and showed up in another city at another A.A. meeting, with another name, to do it again.
Of course nobody knew his real name, and nobody published a warning to tell
other groups that he was coming.
</font>
<p>
Keep up the good work mate, and if you wish to hear them, I can give further
examples of why I would advise anyone who genuinely wishes to get off the
booze to seek help elsewhere, and avoid these charlatans like the plague.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I would like to hear them.
</font>
<p>
Finally, can I thank you for your pages about the
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">addiction monster</a>&quot; &#8212; a
straight-forward, logical and effective way of looking at addiction that, in
a few paragraphs, contains more wisdom than the combined printing presses of
A.A. has ever achieved in its 70+ year history.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the compliment. Yes, I consider that one of my best pages.
It is the distilled experience of 30 years of struggling to quit smoking,
and also some years of trying to quit drinking. It's what I slowly learned
the hard way.
