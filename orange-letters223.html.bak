Dear Recovering Genius,

<p>
So you say that Alcoholism is not a disease?

<p>
You do not say that in your opinion or diagnosis that Alcoholism is not a disease..

<p>
This is a lack of humility dear sir.

<p>
Are you a doctor?

<p>
Or are you just another garden variety drunk dope fiend, the same as I?

<p>
Yea, I am being a sarcastic smart-ass. It is a character flaw... Something is working
in me pursing a doctrine degree in the college of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
I am very confident from reading your article that you could go before the board of
the American Medical Association and prove them wrong and alter their diagnosis that
alcoholism is a disease.?

Do you drink?

David

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello David,
<p>
Thanks for the questions.

<p>
Taking your last question first, I don't drink. I have ten years clean and sober now.
And ten years off of cigarettes too.
<p>
Then, the question of &quot;disease&quot;.  No, I don't think I am the smartest man in the world.
But I quote some men who are.
For example, we were just talking about Herbert Fingarette and his book. 
Herbert Fingarette is a distinguished
professor at the University of California, and has been a
consultant on alcoholism and addiction to the World Health
Organization and a Fellow of the Stanford Center for Advanced
Studies in the Behavioral Sciences.
<p>
Read Herbert Fingarette's book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Fingarette" target="_blank"><i>Heavy Drinking: The Myth of Alcoholism as a Disease</i></a>.
<p>
 Prof. Fingarette found that alcoholics are not
&quot;powerless&quot;, or suffering from a &quot;loss of control&quot;.
The truth is, they have lots of control over their drug and alcohol consumption.
And they are not suffering from a &quot;disease&quot;. There is no such &quot;disease&quot; as alcoholism.

<p>
Now you can play word games with definitions, and try to twist any little discomfort into
a disease. Lots of people do, even drug addicts. &quot;I'm sick, I need more medicine.&quot;
(<a href="orange-definitions.html#disease">Look here for another definition of disease</a>.)
But that does not make habitual excessive drinking of alcohol into a disease
like cancer, tuberculosis, or diabetes.

<p>
<a name="AMA"> </a>
I know that the American Medical Association declared that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is a disease.
The AMA is just a private club for doctors that has the goal of enriching itself and
doctors. The AMA has a very sordid history.
The longtime president of the AMA, the man who built the AMA up into the big, influential
organization that it is, Morris Fishbein, was busted for racketeering. He would not endorse
a pharmaceutical company's medicines unless they bought big, expensive, full-page ads
in his Journal of the American Medical Association. So whether medicines were approved
by the AMA depended on how much money Fishbein got.
<a href="orange-links.html#AMA_critics" target="_blank">Look here for much more on the corruption of the AMA</a>.

<p>
Back in the nineteen-fifties, the AMA even
endorsed cigarette smoking as perfectly okay. Would you care to guess what kind of a
bribe the AMA collected from the tobacco industry for that?
<p>
Also in the nineteen-fifties, the AMA declared that &quot;alcoholism&quot; was an &quot;illness&quot;.
Not a disease. An illness. They did not bother to actually define what the &quot;illness&quot; was.
They just mollified some noisy A.A. members by declaring that alcoholism was an illness.
They based that statement on no medical research &#8212; it was just politics, just like
the declaration that cigarettes are okay for you.
<p>
<p>
So for forty years, the AMA had an &quot;illness&quot; without a definition.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;What is alcoholism?&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I dunno, but Joe drinks too much, so I guess he's got it.&quot;<br>

<p>
And how do you get this &quot;illness&quot;? Can you get it from sharing a drink with an alcoholic?
Kissing an alcoholic? Rubbing against one? Can you get alcoholism from a dirty toilet seat?

<p>
Then in the nineteen-nineties, the AMA had a joint committee of two Alcoholics Anonymous
front groups finally write a definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<b>&quot;The Joint Committee of the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence and the American Society of Addiction Medicine&quot;</b>
produced a definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot; that is so twisted and
goofy that it does not even say that
alcoholism is caused by drinking alcohol. Of course not. The true believers in the A.A. front
groups wanted to leave the door
open for declaring that &quot;alcoholism is a spiritual disease&quot;, caused by
&quot;character defects&quot;.

<p>
Speaking of which, please define &quot;character defects&quot;, and explain
how they cause the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;. That is just crazy
Alcoholics Anonymous cult religion dogma, not medical knowledge.
<p>
The truth is, Bill Wilson was just serving up some reheated Buchmanism, when he
declared that &quot;alcoholism&quot; was the result of &quot;defects of
character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
and &quot;wrongs&quot;. What Buchmanism said was &quot;sins&quot;.
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#social_problems" target="_blank">&quot;Sins are the cause
of all human problems,&quot; Buchman said</a>.
<p>
But Bill would have gotten into trouble with the Catholic Church if he
said that alcoholism was caused by sins, and that the alcoholics have
to go to meetings and confess their sins.
The Catholic Church has a strong ban on public confessions.
So, to avoid losing the Catholics,
Bill declared that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is caused by &quot;defects of
character&quot;, and that the alcoholics have to &quot;admit&quot; their &quot;wrongs&quot;
and &quot;shortcomings&quot;. But Bill still meant &quot;confess your sins&quot;.
(And in Bill's second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, he dropped
the pretense and went back to talking about sins, even harping on
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#12X12q14" target="_blank"><i>The Seven Deadly Sins</i></a>
and how bad we are.)
<p>
Please note that the American Psychiatric Association does not endorse any such
mental illness as &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
So the AMA is lecturing us about a mental illness, while the APA says that there isn't
any such disease.
<p>
Here is the page of the DSM-IV that lists the alcohol-related mental disorders:
<p>
<center>
<!-- img src="orange-DSM-IV-195.png" width=900 height=1444 border=6 bordercolor="#9F0000" alt="DSM-IV page 195" -->
<img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/orange-DSM-IV-195.png" width="90%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" alt="DSM-IV page 195">
</center>
<p>
There is no &quot;alcoholism&quot; listed. The American Psychiatric Association
 refuses to even use that word.

<p>
<a name="genetic"> </a>
Personally, I also think that there is a genetic component to having big problems with
alcohol misuse.
That does not make &quot;alcoholism&quot; a &quot;disease&quot;.
That just means that someone's chances of
having a problem with alcohol are greater. When someone is really suffering from
a real genetic disease, they have absolutely no choice in the matter, like getting Huntington's
Chorea. It's a certain death sentence.  No choice.
The alcoholic has a choice in whether to drink himself to death.

<p>
A researcher who found a gene for the tendency to abuse alcohol
 stated that there is evidence that
&quot;A Functional Neuropeptide Y Leu7Pro Polymorphism [is] Associated
With Alcohol Dependence in a Large Population Sample From the United
States&quot;. He explained it this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;This is only the second specific
genetic mechanism ever identified that modulates risk for alcohol
dependence.&quot;<br>
(See: <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>. 2002;59:825-831;<br>

<!-- a href="http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html" -->
http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html<!-- /a --> <font color="#9F0000"> == dead link</font>)<br>

</font>
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I like that careful terminology:
<b><i>Modulates the risk for</i>, not <i>causes</i>, alcohol dependence.</b>
Having the gene increases your odds for having a problem with alcohol, but does not
<i>cause</i> you to drink.
<p>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: 2014.12.09:
<a href="orange-letters276.html#Emma_H" target="_blank">A study by the NIAAA</a>
found that mutations of the gene that grows dopamine receptors in peoples' brains
makes some people get much more pleasure out of alcohol than other people.
</font>

<p>
By the way, I speak from experience too. My father was a drinking-to-die alcoholic, and
his mother was an alcoholic before him. Then I had a big problem with alcohol
for nearly 20 years.
Yes, I think that there is a genetic component to it. But that gene never bought me a beer
and popped the top for me.
It never twisted my arm and forced me to drink. One friend in SMART liked to say,
&quot;We aren't in college any more. Nobody is holding you down and pouring the booze in.&quot;

<p>
Oh, and back to the &quot;defects of character&quot; issue, can you explain
how a genetic factor causes us to have &quot;defects of character&quot;
that make us drink too much alcohol? Are sins caused by bad genes?
Were the Nazis right? Should we just kill all of the bad people to get rid of their
bad genes and purify the race, and we will end up with a perfectly-behaved society and Heaven on Earth?

<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
And then, finally, you fell back on the standard Alcoholics Anonymous
way of avoiding the truth &#8212; claiming that telling the truth about
A.A. is doing &quot;a disservice to alcoholics seeking sobriety&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The garbage you are writing is only hurting people..<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Congratulations, you made the list.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
Lastly, look at the signature below. Bill Wilson may have yammered nonsense about
&quot;spiritual diseases&quot; on page 64 of the <i>Big Book</i>, but
he was smart enough to tailor his message to his audience.
In front of the Catholic priests, Bill Wilson declared that alcoholism was a sin,
not a disease, and that the cure was confession and prayer and getting closer to God.
The priests liked the sound of that.
<p>
(Then, in front of the psychiatrists,
<a href="orange-letters157.html#APA" target="newwin36">Bill bragged
about how good A.A. was at messing with people's minds and doing religious conversions</a>.)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hello El Salvador,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety.
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about you getting kicked off of the About.Com forum. Unfortunately, I
hear about that kind of stuff often. Most of those 12-Step-oriented
&quot;Sobriety&quot; and &quot;self-help&quot; web sites are quick to banish anyone who challenges
the standard 12-Step dogma. They just want people who
will toe the line and parrot the common A.A. sayings and repeat the <i>Big Book</i>
insanity and declare that it really works great.
Steppers have a very funny idea of &quot;free speech&quot;
and &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;. They are quick to ban anyone who says things that they don't
wish to hear, even if it's true.
(Which is just some more proof that it really is a cult.)

<p>
On the bright side, I'm working on a forum here. It's close to working. I just have to figure
out a few more technicalities of Drupal to get it operational.
And I don't plan to ban anyone. I'm a firm believer in freedom of speech, and letting
everyone have his or her say.
<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Ds S&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Fw: Links that you might find interesting<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,
<p>
Again I realize the Tibet debate is ancillary to the main purpose of your
website, but you mentioned that I was probably just repeating Chinese propaganda
without even knowing it.  I respectfully disagree please see my argument below.
Again please do not post my e-mail address.

<p>
Very Respectfully,<br>
No one of any importance

<p>
You mention that the Dali Lama wasn't ruling at the time of the Chinese
invasion, but a regent was ruling in his stead.  Ok, who elected the regent.
Nobody he was appointed.  Who ruled before the regent.  The previous Dali Lama,
whom no one elected.  A dynasty of absolute monarchs whom the people did not get
to choose.  That is the definition of ruling with an iron fist.  You come to
power without the consent of the people, and make decisions without the consent
of the people.  Even though the Chinese invaded before the Dali Lama could take
control of the government, it doesn't change the fact that he would have just
been the latest of a long line of monarchs.
<p>
Now let us assume that all my accusations about tyranny during the rule of
the Dali Lama dynasty is simply Chinese propaganda, and that life in Tibet under
the rule of the Dali Lama dynasty was heaven on Earth.  Let us further assume
that philosophy that the Dali Lama espouses in his multiple books is what he
really believes and how he would actually rule if he had the chance.  All that
means is that if he returned to power he would be an enlightened despot who
ruled with an iron fist, rather than a cruel tyrant who ruled with an iron
fist.  There have been enlightened despots in history (Catherine the Great,
Frederick the Great, Shan Nan Shah Palavi) who have attempted to bring about
social reform based on Western philosophy and ideas about equality.  Never the
less they brought about reforms through tight fisted rule.
<p>
When the Dali Lama talks about freeing Tibet, does he discuss his plans for
instituting education, health care, etc?  Does he discuss writing a constitution
to guarantee basic rights under law, establish a legislature so that the people
have a say in what the laws are, and to curtail his powers as sovereign?  Unless
he does these things he could be the kindest, gentlest, benign ruler in the
history of the planet when returned to power, but he would still be ruling with
an iron fist.  Just remember iron fisted rule doesn't necessarily barbaric or
cruel, it means that it rule without consent of the governed.
<p>
As for Communist China let us assume all social programs are immersed in
propaganda.  It is more than like that they are, especially the education
system, but here's the thing.  As long as they teach the three R's (reading,
writing arithmetic) it is a step in the right direction.  Again I'm not
asserting that China is a great place to live.  It isn't for one very same
reasons I stated in the paragraph above this one specifically the Chinese do not
have rights guaranteed to them under a constitution, they do not get to elect
members of the Politiburo, and there is no check on the powers of the Premeir.
<p>
If I may be so bold instead of &quot;Free Tibet,&quot; perhaps a better stamp might be
something to the effect of &quot;Restore Human Rights to All People Oppressed by
Chinese Rule&quot;, &quot;Restore Human Rights to All People Oppressed by Tyranny&quot;, or
maybe just &quot;Sic Semper Tyrannus.&quot;

<p>
To summarize my point: I'm not saying Tibet doesn't need to be freed from
Communist China.  I'm just saying that returning an absolute monarch to the
throne, regardless of how nice of guy he happens to be, is not freeing them.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, &quot;No one of any importance&quot;,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And of course I won't print your email address.
<p>
The line that really had me gagging was:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Even though the Chinese invaded before the Dali Lama could take
control of the government, it doesn't change the fact that he would have just

<p>
All that
means is that if he returned to power he would be an enlightened despot who
ruled with an iron fist, rather than a cruel tyrant who ruled with an iron
fist.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
We cannot predict the future. I cannot even tell you for sure whether you or I would rule
with an iron fist if we got absolute power. In this society, we generally
do not convict people for the crimes that they might commit in the future,
if they get a chance to do it.
If that were the case, we would all be in prison for something or other, especially sex.
<p>
(Somebody did a science fiction movie about that, where people were arrested before they
committed murder, because some psychics said that they were going to do it. That
system didn't work out very well. Innocent people were getting busted and put
in prison. I think it's better if we stick to
only convicting people who have really committed crimes, not those who just might do it.)

<p>
That &quot;rule with an iron fist&quot; phrase sticks in my craw. Where do you get that?
I simply do not see any evidence that the Dalai Lama would rule Tibet with &quot;an iron fist&quot;
if he returned to Tibet.
<p>
Do you have any quotes from his books that show that he would rule like a tyrant if he
got the chance? I've been buying all of his books that I find at Goodwill, and I just don't
see it.

<p>
And again, you are praising the Chinese education, while ignoring that fact that it is
intended to destroy the Tibetan culture.  It is more indoctrination than education.

<p>
In your previous letter, you claimed, or at least implied, that there was
something wrong with the Tibetan system because
they lived in poverty.
Yes, I'm sure they lived in poverty. No joke. I'm surprised that they were able to live as well as they
did up there. They are at an extreme altitude, living about as high up as people can survive,
in a very dry arid climate. Farming there is a monster. 
<p>
I lived in New Mexico for 20 years, a while back. For some years, we lived at 8000 feet,
up in the mountains.
That is nothing compared to living at 16,000 feet, or more. You really feel every
additional thousand feet above 10,000 feet.
The thin air just sucks the energy right out of you. You are huffing and puffing whenever you do
any heavy labor.
<p>
 Gardening up there is difficult because the growing season is very short.
It's a race to get crops to mature in the small time span from frost to frost &#8212;

Childbirth at high altitudes is dangerous because babies can have fatal problems with bilirubin &#8212;
babies' brains can get suffocated at birth due to a massive die-off of red blood cells
clogging the blood vessels and keeping the brain from getting enough oxygen.
It happened to one baby at our commune.  He died.
<p>
So when people complain about how poor the Tibetan people were, and blame the theocracy,
I don't think the theocracy has anything to do with it.

<p>
Meanwhile, as I write this, I am listening to NPR talking about how the Republicans
want to balance the budget by cutting Grandma's heat assistance, Social Security, and Medicare/Medicaid,
and also cutting the children's education and WIC assistance, while
refusing to cut Pentagon pork-barrel projects like a second jet engine for the F-35 fighter plane
that the Pentagon doesn't even want, but it can't be cut because the engine is
manufactured in Congressman Boehner's district. Oh, isn't Democracy wonderful?
Now who is really heartless and ruling with an iron fist?

<p>
It's amazing how arrogant Americans are, imagining that they are superior to everybody
else who is different.
So Tibet is an inferior society because they didn't adopt democracy 600 years ago like
Switzerland did?

<p>
It is kind of pointless for the Dalai Lama to discuss writing a constitution for Tibet.
The last message I heard on the subject was the Dalai Lama instructing his people to
accept being ruled by the Chinese, because they were never going to break free from China.
It's hopeless.
<p>
About the &quot;Free Tibet&quot; banner: I think the first priority is to get rid of the
oppressive Chinese overlords. Then the Tibetan people can decide for themselves what
they want to do next.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hello Kenny,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Of course Frank Buchman wanted to convert Adolf Hitler. I never said that
Buchman didn't. Where did you get that misimpression?
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Robert_Byron1" target="_blank">
I clearly stated how the Oxford Group bothered the Mitford family</a>, 
trying to get an invitation to see Hitler, with the goal of &quot;changing&quot; Hitler:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Later that evening Bobo's father, Lord
Redesdale, also in Munich, was telephoned by an Oxford Group spokesman, saying the Group
wanted to 'change' the F&uuml;hrer. Bobo said she did not want the F&uuml;hrer changed.
'No, damn it,' Redesdale agreed, 'I like the feller as he is.'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Himmler, Reichsf&uuml;hrer</i>, Peter Padfield, page 233.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dr. Frank Buchman wanted to convert everybody in the world into one of his sycophant followers.
Buchman especially wanted to convert the national leaders. Buchman imagined a Heaven on Earth
where Christian Fascist dicators ran all of the nations of the world.
The national leaders would &quot;Listen To God&quot;,
and get their orders from God
(<a href="orange-rroot090.html#paradox" target="_blank">with Frank's help
 and reinterpretation</a>,
of course), and then the dictators would give their orders to
the people, and then they would have a whole world under &quot;God-control&quot;, and
everything would be just fine.
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_interview" target="_blank">In his newspaper interview
 with the New York World Telegram, Buchman explained</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of course, I don't condone everything the Nazis do.
Anti-Semitism? Bad, naturally. I suppose Hitler sees a
Karl Marx in every Jew.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;But think what it would mean to the world if Hitler
surrendered to the control of God. Or Mussolini. Or
any dictator. Through such a man God could control a
nation overnight and solve every last, bewildering
problem...<br>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The world needs the dictatorship of the living spirit of God.
...
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;... Human problems aren't economic. They're
moral and they can't be solved by immoral measures.
They could be solved within a God-controlled
democracy, or perhaps I should say a theocracy, and
they could be solved through a God-controlled Fascist
dictatorship.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">

<i>Hitler and Buchman</i>, Reinhold Niebuhr, <i>The Christian Century</i>,

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, of course, pure Fascism. And it's a Fascist dictator's dream come true.
In the Middle Ages, kings declared that they ruled by Divine Will: God had made them born as
crown princes because God wanted them to be the kings who would rule the kingdoms.
It was allegedly God's choice, and you had better not go against it.
Well, imagine Twentieth-Century dictators who could declare:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;With Dr. Frank Buchman's help, I listen to God, and I get my orders
straight from God. Now I am just passing those orders on, so you must obey all of my orders
without question. It is the Will Of God, and you must not disobey God.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
By the way, notice that Frank Buchman did not wish to cure Hitler of being a Fascist or a
dictator. Those things were just fine with Frank Buchman. Buchman hinted that he would get
Hitler to tone down the anti-Semitism thing a bit, but otherwise, he wasn't going to
change Hitler much when he &quot;changed&quot; Hitler.
Buchman just wanted to make Hitler one of his followers.

<p>
Lastly, I'm not sure what you meant by the &quot;therapy&quot; remark. 
If you think that I need therapy because I believe what history teaches us, then I think that
you need to take some of your own medicine.
You know the old saying about, &quot;Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat
it.&quot;
<p>
Or are you a Buchmanite who is in denial and trying to rewrite history?
Your letter hinted that Buchman was okay because he wanted to convert Hitler.
How did Buchman's desire to &quot;convert&quot; Adolf Hitler (into one of Frank's followers)
make Buchman okay?
<p>
Have a good day now.

On the link that you sent, there was no &quot;http://&quot; on the front of it, and I forgot to add it.
If I don't do that, then the web browser will interpret the link as a local link, and try to
find a subdirectory named &quot;www.Time.com&quot; on my web site, and find the web page inside it.
There is no such subdirectory, so you got an error message of &quot;File Not Found&quot;.

Your story reminds us once again that anybody can pretend to be a recovery guru in Alcoholics
Anonymous. All that someone needs to do is claim to have a lot of years of sobriety, and
he can pass himself off as a wise man and a counselor and a healer.
There are no tests to see if an A.A. sponsor is good, or qualified for the job. Or sane.
Or even really sober.

Dear Orange,

<p>
Wow!  Your site is amazing.  I am in OA and have been struggling with staying.  Not
because I want to eat or the approach is worthless, but simply because it is based
on a lie.  I have chosen not to leave, but I will not quit seeking the truth.  The
Rockefellers are undoubtedly the key players here (as I see other letter writers
have mentioned).
<p>
  What do you know about Tom Driberg?  He seems to have been the
driving force behind discrediting Buchman in the UK/Europe.  As you probably know,
he was an MI5 intelligence agent and personal friends with Alister Crowley.  (I'm
not a conspiracy theorist or anything, he admitted this in his autobiography!)  I
had always heard rumors that Bill Wilson knew Crowley.  Do you know anything about
that?  I've seen no evidence, but of course he was deeply into the occult.

<p>
Thank you so much for all your hard work.  Keep it up!

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
April H.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello April,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
Yes, Tom Driberg is an interesting person. He was all of the things that you described,
including a newspaper reporter, and a former Communist who was drafted
to work for MI5 and spy on the English Communists.
And he was also the first openly-gay man elected to the British Parliament.
The only item that I had not heard of was the link to Aleister Crowley.
(Or just didn't remember it. I read his autobiography, but didn't recall that detail.)

<p>
Tom Driberg wrote an autobiography,
<a name="orange-bibliography.html#Driberg_Passions" target="_blank"><i>Ruling Passions</i></a>,
where he told the story of a lot of that.

<p>
I guess it was kind of inevitable that Driberg would lock horns with the Oxford Group and
Frank Buchman, considering
<a href="orange-rroot630.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's vicious attacks on homosexuals</a>
(to cover up his own homosexuality).
Also, Tom Driberg was very left-wing in his politics, while Frank Buchman
was a Fascist. So they were bound to disagree.
First, Tom Driberg wrote newspaper articles that were critical of the Oxford 
Group and their pro-Nazi attitudes. Then Driberg fought against them in Parliament.
Then a book publisher, Secker &amp; Warberg in London, invited Driberg to do a book
about Moral Re-Armament, because of his previous writing about MRA. The book is
<a name="orange-bibliography.html#Driberg" target="_blank"><i>The Mystery of Moral Re-Armament,
A Study of Frank Buchman and His Movement</i></a>,
Secker &amp; Warberg, London, 1964.
<p>
Needless to say, the MRA members hated it. They wrote a rebuttal,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#antiDriberg" target="_blank"><i>The Open Secret of MRA;
an examination of Mr. Driberg's 'critical examination' of Moral Re-Armament</i></a>, by
J. P. Thornton-Duesbery, M.A.
(Master of St. Peter's College, Oxford),
Blandford Press, London, 1964, which is quite a collection of
deceptive, angry and hateful propaganda tricks (as is much of the
Oxford Group/Moral Re-Armament literature).


<p>
Ah, history. What a circus.
<p>
I have not heard of Bill Wilson having any contact with Aleister Crowley. Yes, he was
<a href="orange-heresy.html#ouija" target="_blank">very much into the occult,
claiming to contact spirits of the dead with spirit rapping and channelling
and the Ouija board</a>.
<p>
And guess what famous cult leader really was associated with Aleister Crowley, for sure?
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of Scientology.  See
<a name="orange-bibliography.html#HubbardJr" target="_blank"><i>L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?</i></a>
by Bent Corydon and L. Ron Hubbard, Jr.  (Lyle Stuart Inc., Secaucus, New Jersey, 1987).
That book was actually co-authored by L. Ron Hubbard's own son, the heir apparent
who defected from Scientology and let all of the family skeletons out of the closet.
<p>
What a small cult and occult world it is.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Mr Orange,
<p>
 my name is Dave and i'm in the UK.
I've quick-read

'<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The 12 Steps Interpreted</a>'

 and '<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">AA Booster</a>...', I will read
them again sometime.
<p>
I really appreciated 'The 12 Steps Interpreted'.
As an active participant in AA just now contemplating step 4 (!), I am
finding the whole 12 Steps programme goofy and your words helped put things
into perspective for me.
<p>
There are intelligent people in my home groups and genuine ones.  They, to a
man,
do not seem to see how daft the programme is nor how daft the 'big book' is.
Daft means dumb in UK speak !
<p>
I believe you have 'Weight Watchers' in the US.  That is how I regard AA.
Meaning people go to Weight Watchers because they can't stop over-eating
and people go to AA because they can't stop over-drinking.
<p>
I am writing a book about alcoholism (with my AA experience being focal).
Can you tell me a little bit about you ?
<p>
Your '12 Steps Interpreted' and 'AA Booster...' sound like 2 different
authors ? &#8212; Meaning the former is critique and the latter downright anti-AA
!?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello David,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments and
 the questions.
And good luck with your sobriety and breaking free of the craziness.

<p>
Starting at the top,
yes, there are some intelligent people in A.A. groups. A sad truth of this world is the
fact that even very intelligent people can get fooled by some of the worst of stupid hoaxes.
Synanon had a doctor who performed vasectomies on all of the men (except the cult leader),
 so that the cult leader would not be bother by the inconvenience of crying babies and children.
And Jim Jones's <i>People's Temple</i> had a doctor and a nurse who mixed up the cyanide Flavor-Aid&reg;
for everyone to drink and die.
Intelligence is no defense against insanity or stupidity.

<p>
There is a good reason for the difference in tone between
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps Interpreted</a>
and

<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>Spirituality: The key to recovery from alcoholism</i></a>.

The second web page is about an example of the worst kind of deception: using the trappings of
science and medicine and spirituality
 to sell quackery to sick people. I am sort of scientific. I have studied science
all of my life, since as far back as I can remember in childhood, and I majored in Biology in
college. So I have a great deal of affection and respect for science, and it really pisses me
off to see lying frauds pretending to be scientific as they push cult religion on sick people
as a sure-fire cure for a deadly condition, and lie about how well it works.
<p>
I generally do not support the death penalty, because it seems that it is mostly the poor black
boys who get it, while the rich guys hire dream teams of lawyers and walk free. But I could make an
exception in my standards for those criminals who foist quack medicine on dying people.
<p>
I just received another letter that reveals the kind of suffering that fake healers cause,

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Read your paper on 12 steps.  you are the foremost expert in this area.  Why no book?

<p>
You might find this of interest.  You quote Keith Ditman 60's studies on alcoholics.
Ironically, he experimented in the 50's by giving LSD to alcoholics and one of them
was Charles Dederich.    Chuck later claimed it was while on LSD in that experiment
he got the idea for Synanon and broke from AA.   There is lot on Ditman on my
site....

 Just search &quot;Ditman.&quot;

Hi. That's flattering. I have an invitation to do a book;
I just feel overwhelmed because I know just how much work it
really is.  Personally, I'd rather go play with some

I knew about Keith Ditman and LSD. Didn't know that he gave it to
Dederich.

<p>
Misspelled your name? Oops. Let me guess: Marantz?<br>
Yes, I found it. I'll fix it.<br>
That is my old electronics background creeping in there.<br>
Marantz was a very expensive high-end line of audio gear in the
1960s. Some things just never leave your head.

I'll check out Cielo and Ditman.

What is your background?   Of interest True Believer was written by a longshoreman,
best book on Synanon by a carpenter.

<p>
<font color="blue">
My background is everything from majored in biology in college, to was a cost accountant
in the Air Force, to a hippie on a commune building log cabins, to TV repairman and rock band
sound engineer,
to electronics technician and computer programmer at Los Alamos, to web programmer, to alcoholic.

They and you have a built in understanding.  I am amazed, however, extent of your
research.  the time you committed must have been enormous.  I suggest you take your
best stuff and make an e-book out of.  give it title that indicates a collection of
essays om subject of mind coercive groups or something like that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it has been a lot of research.
<p>
I think it already is an e-book. It's called a web site.
</font>
<p>
On my site Birth of Synanon and Dederich.... I tell story of AA and Chuck's
experience, than LSD trip with Ditman, etc.  My view on AA is little softer.  They
are cultish, become true believer's but Wilson put in good plan to prevent AA from
being exploited as Dederich did Synanon.  AA does not need to be forever for all,
but for many.   Synanon failed for not having a continuous program add on like AA
once members split.  that failure led to idea no one should ever leave and that cut
off with outside reality  grew into contained madne

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I have a harsher attitude towards A.A. I would question the idea of Bill Wilson's plan
to keep A.A. from being exploited. That is the standard fake A.A. history that they publish.
The truth is, Bill wanted to arrange things so that nobody but him
could get the goodies. Everybody else had to be anonymous and have no profit motive,
and &quot;abandon ego and self-seeking&quot;.
But not Bill.
<p>
At the same time, Bill wanted to be seen as noble and selfless, so he made a
big deal out of turning control of A.A. over to a Board of Trustees.
But Bill expected them to rubber-stamp his dictates.
<p>
Bill Wilson was shocked to find that the Board of Trustees would not
obey his orders and do as he demanded. They voted their consciences instead.
Bill was outraged when
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Hartigan4" target="_blank">they refused
to pay his mistresses for him</a>, and
told him to pay his mistresses himself. The nerve of them. The effrontery.
<p>
Likewise, the Board refused to approve of Bill's new
&quot;Twelve Traditions&quot; that he just made up one day.
So Bill quit A.A. and went and sulked in his country home in Bedford Hills (that A.A. paid for).
But he kept on collecting royalty checks for
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">the stolen copyright of the <i>Big Book</i></a>
for the rest of his life.
<p>
Then his wife Lois Wilson collected the checks after him. I hear that by the time of her death, she
was getting $900,000 per year. I don't know exactly how much Bill was collecting while he was
alive, but it's safe to say that he comfortably feathered his nest.

</font>
<p>
Then it became uncontained.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, &quot;uncontained&quot;. That is one way of describing it.
<p>
But actually, the story that A.A. was great in the good old days, and has just gone downhill
lately, is another A.A. fairy tale. Alcoholics Anonymous was always a lying cult.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson routinely lied
about how many members A.A. had and how sober they were</a>, and the A.A. history,
and himself.
There was never a Golden Age when A.A. worked great. That's all just the standard A.A. false history.
<p>
Most everything that you have ever heard about A.A. is a lie. A.A. has been promoting a false
view of A.A. for 70 years now. For example, the Hallmark made-for-TV movie &quot;My Name is Bill W.&quot;
tells you that Bill Wilson met Dr. Bob in the spring of 1935, and they went around Akron hospitals
recruiting and saving sick alcoholics, and figuring out how to help alcoholics by doing it.
And they started Alcoholics Anonymous right there.
<p>
Wrong. The truth is that both Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith
were members of a pro-Nazi cult religion called
the Oxford Group that was run by a renegade Lutheran minister name Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman.
Bill and Dr. Bob were recruiting alcoholics for the Oxford Group because
they believed that Frank Buchman's flavor of cult religion was the cure for alcoholism.
They didn't care that Frank Buchman went to the Nuremberg Nazi Party
rallies year after year. They kept right on recruiting more alcoholics for the Oxford Group,
and teaching them to confess their sins and &quot;surrender&quot; (to the cult's leadership).
<p>
In 1936, Frank Buchman went to the
Berlin Olympics as the personal guest of Heinrich Himmler, the vicious leader of the Gestapo
and the SS who would soon run the Halocaust that exterminated 6 million Jews.
Then Frank Buchman came home and
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_interview" target="_blank">declared to a New York newspaper</a>,
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler, who
built a front line of defense against the anti-Christ of Communism.&quot;
Neither Bill Wilson nor Dr. Robert Smith quit the Oxford Group in protest. They just kept on
recruiting more alcoholics for Frank Buchman.
But that isn't what the movie tells you, is it?

<p>
All of the rest of the Alcoholics Anonymous history is similarly white-washed and distorted.

<p>
The promotion of the myth that A.A. is a wonderful
organization that has sobered up millions of alcoholics is actually A.A.'s greatest
accomplishment. It may not get the drunks sober, but oh is it good at publicity.
Not even Scientology with its Celebrity Center in Hollywood can match the A.A.
publicity machine.
Alcoholics Anonymous is the most successful cult in America.
</font>

<p>
If you read Escape from Golden State Manor... the defense used Ditman as an expert
and I deposed him. My success in that case led to my being referred case against
Synanon. Imagine my surprise when I learned Dederich claimed Synanon grew out of
his LSD trip after Ditman gave it to him.

<p>
<font color="blue">

Yes, that is surprising. What a small world it is after all.
I'll check out that book.
<p>
Have a good day now.
