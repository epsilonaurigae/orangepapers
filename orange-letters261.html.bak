Subject:  	Appreciation<br>

<p>
I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate all the hard work and research that
you have put into your website.

<p>
I have been going to AA meetings for nearly 8 years and have always been a
non  &#8212;  theist.  My first meeting in rehab, I was lucky enough to have had the speaker
say that she was an atheist and used the group as her higher power, which made me
feel I could at least tolerate the meetings that I was being forced to attend.

<p>
But what really changed my addiction to drugs and alcohol was the doctor that spoke
at the rehab and explained to me what was going on in my brain around addiction.  It
finally made sense to me why I couldn't stop using and it was the memory of that
talk and thinking about all my receptor sites healing that helped to keep me sober &#8212; 
not prayer.  I eventually went back to school and studied neuroscience and worked in
a lab studying traumatic brain injury because of my love of science and the brain &#8212; 
knowing that drugs and alcohol and my neurochemistry did not mix....  I have been
sober since January 19, 2004 with no relapse.

<p>
I did the &quot;Atheist/Agnostic&quot; 12 steps and worked with a sponsor who accepted my
non  &#8212;  belief system.  But recently I feel like I have hit a wall.  I have felt that
the 'Babble Fish' that I have to place in my head each time I go to a meeting to
translate all the Higher Power and God talk into something that I can listen to has
just gone belly up.  My Babble Fish has expired from Ick.

<p>
I found your website and it has helped me see that the cultish aspects of AA have
worked on me &#8212; feeling like I am going to relapse if I don't think like everyone
else.  Trying for so many years to &quot;fit in&quot; and never feeling like I do.  Thank
goodness I have a few friends who feel similarly to me that I can talk to.  And your
well-researched website has been very helpful.  I am a scientist at heart and love
reading papers and data &#8212; that is how I craft my philosophies and views of the
world.  That is my &quot;spirituality&quot; &#8212; spiritus just means &quot;breath&quot; in Latin.  When I
breathe, I do so with gratitude that I have the intellect to understand addiction
and how my brain cells react differently than, say, my husband's who can have a beer
at night every now and then and not become an addict.  My mother died from a drug
and alcohol overdose when I was a teenager and I was heading down that path.  Rehab
was what I needed and having a doctor that explained
the neurochemistry to me was my &quot;evangelical conversion&quot; (loved that quote from
Jerome Frank...).  If I had been told to go to 90 meetings in 90 days, I don't know
what my sobriety would have been like.  I feel incredibly fortunate to have had
both that addiction doctor and the atheist speak at my rehab.

<p>
Keep up the great work.  You are not alone.  We are out here listening....

<p>

From:  	&quot;Adrian B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Article for Salon on AG, 21st Century AA<br>

<p>
Good evening,
<p>
Adrian B. here, journalist, sober fellow and former visitor to the
Atlantic Group who is working on a story for Salon.com &lt;http://Salon.com/&gt;
tentatively called &quot;Not Your Father's AA&quot; about the ways in which AA has
been evolving over the past few years. In other words, it's a story about
all the things AAers are doing outside meetings (i.e. retreats, sober
parties, visits to the Bill W. House, etc.), the earlier ages at which
people are coming to AA, the different flavors of the AA meetings and the
effect technology has had on AA (Facebook, for example).

<p>
No group exemplifies this change better that the Atlantic Group  &#8212;  Pacific
Group  &#8212;  Midtown Group (Washington, DC) Dynamic. It's a formula that seems to
have taken hold in a lot of ways  &#8212;  for good and for ill. I sent an email
around about a week or so ago seeking out information on people's
experiences with AA, particularly the Atlantic Group, and/or Pacific
Group/Midtown Group, since I understand they are all related to the Pacific
Group founded by Clancy Imislund. However, I didn't receive much of a
response, or when I did, it was a response citing the 11th Tradition about
anonymity.

<p>
I am still writing the article. I believe people have a right and a need to
know what to expect before they go into those rooms, good and bad. And I
don't believe that silence helps  &#8212;  or protects  &#8212;  anyone.  So I am emailing
again because I am soliciting the other side of the things I have been
reading and hearing about the Atlantic/Pacific/Midtown Group, which are
becoming a large portion of my story. Namely, I have been reading/hearing
about the sexual misconduct alleged against Clancy Imislund, the
encouragement of people in these groups to form &quot;families&quot;, date and live
together, the strict adherence to AA principles and these family codes at
the risk of isolation or social censure, the discouragement of psychiatric
and other medications within these three groups and finally, the death of an
Atlantic Group member named Natalia, who allegedly committed suicide after
the AG holiday party last December.

<p>
This blog paints a pretty severe picture:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005153/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/07/midtown_group_aa_group_leads_m.html" target="_blank">
http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/07/midtown_group_aa_group_leads_m.html</a>

<p>
I take a very Didionesque approach to writing: &quot;I write entirely to find out
what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I
want and what I fear.&quot;
 I want to figure this thing out  &#8212;  help me shape this
article. Anonymity  &#8212;  as Susan Cheever interprets it in her biography of Bill
Wilson, &quot;My Name is Bill&quot; &#8212; does not mean silence. It simply means not
using your full name. This is not a damning article. This is your chance to
make a difference in the way people see AA and these particular groups. I
hope you will contact me; I am available through all the following means.

Hello Adrian,
<p>
Thanks for the question. The best sources of information on the Midtown group
that I have are here:
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the Midtown Group</a>.
<p>
Information about Clancy's Pacific Group is here:
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="newwin943">the Pacific Group</a>.

<p>
I like your title, &quot;Not Your Father's A.A.&quot; The problem with that is that your Father's
A.A. was not good either. Nor was your Grandfather's.
The nice neighborhood A.A. self-help group was a legend, a myth, a
fantasy deliberately created by Bill Wilson and the other early A.A. members.
The truth is that A.A. was always a coercive cult religion with a sky-high failure
rate in curing alcoholics:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
... they thought it a good idea to have a preliminary talk with his wife.
And this became part of the way things were done in the early days: Discuss
it first with the wife; find out what you could; then plan your approach.
It should be noted, as well, that the alcoholic himself didn't ask for help.
He didn't have anything to say about it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 1980, pages 82-83.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were such arrogant Oxford Group recruiters that they actually felt
entitled to shove their Oxford Group cult religion quack cure on sick
alcoholics regardless of the patient's wishes or beliefs &#8212; the patient
didn't get any say in the matter of religious conversion. (That is still the attitude of many
so-called counselors and therapists today.)
<p>
More on that
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#didnt_get_any_say" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Then there is the historical A.A. failure rate:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><b>Bill Wilson</b>, at the memorial service for
Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;As a matter of fact, the successful worker [A.A. recruiter]
differs from the unsuccessful one only in being lucky about
his prospects. He simply hits cases who are ready and able
to stop at once.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, quoted in <i>'PASS IT ON',
The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached
the world</i>, page 252.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And Nell Wing, who was a secretary of Alcoholics Anonymous for 35 years, and Bill Wilson's
personal secretary for many of those years, as well as A.A.'s first archivist,
reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;There were alcoholics in the hospitals of whom A.A. could touch and help
only about five percent. The doctors started giving them a dose of LSD,
so that the resistance would be broken down. And they had about
fifteen percent recoveries. This was all a scientific thing.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 370.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It would appear that LSD was three times as effective as Alcoholics Anonymous
for treating alcoholism. Unfortunately,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#LSD_Toronto" target="_blank">that doesn't work either</a>, in the long run.<br>

Hello Martin,
<p>
Thanks for the question. Two things immediately come to mind: true information, and
his desires. That is, does he really want to get out of A.A.?
If he doesn't, then trying to get him out is interferring with his life just as much
as shoving an unwilling victim into A.A.
<p>
But if he has any desire to be free, then telling him the truth can help him.
<ol>
<p><li>
You can start off with the knowledge that A.A. is totally unnecessary and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">does not
improve the sobriety rate of alcoholics at all</a>.
<p><li>
You can also emphasize the harmful aspects of A.A. membership: the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">death rate</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">suicide rate</a>,
the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking</a>, and the
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">divorce rate</a>.

<p><li>
You can also use humor. Print up 
<a href="orange-jokes.html" target="_blank">some joke sheets</a>
for him. (See the end of the file.)


<p><li>
Then you can tell him about
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">
 the falsified history of A.A.</a>, and what A.A. really is.

<p><li>
Then there is my web page on deprogramming:
<a href="orange-deprogram.html" target="_blank">How To Deprogram Your Own Mind</a>.

<p><li>
Oh, and then, for that matter, reading
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>
may remind you of a few things that they are pulling on him. Recognizing
what they do, and how they do it, is helpful in undoing it.

<p><li>
Of course you can refer him to the Orange Papers for more information.

<p><li>
And then, if you wanted more information on cults in general, see
<a href="orange-top10.html#cults" target="_blank">the &quot;Top 10&quot; reading list
on cults, here</a>.
<p>
Especially, you might read Steve Hassan's two books on getting out of cults:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="_blank"><i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i></a>
and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank"><i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>.
They will tell you a lot about the mechanics of cults and how they mess with your
mind, and how you can fight it.
</ol>

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.
<p>

<p>
P.S.:
I forgot two of the most obvious aids:
<ol>
<p><li> The list of non-cult recovery organizations. I just put together a new
file of their addresses, here:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>.
<p><li> Many discussions of what helps people to get sober and stay sober:

Hello again, John,

I hear that other people have also written to &quot;Agent Green&quot;, and gotten no answer from her.
She seems to prefer positive, supportive letters.

<p>
However, I just saw her Facebook web page, where she continues to claim that I distort the

<p>
In all fairness, I don't expect her to have a forum on her web site. Setting one up proved
to be complicated and tricky. It took me months to figure it out and get it right, and
I'm an old computer programmer.

So in the mean time, her Facebook page is sort of a forum.

&quot;High Watch has a rich history connected to both the New Thought movement and more
profoundly, Alcoholics Anonymous. Bill W., co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous,
established High Watch Farm in 1940 as the first 12 Step treatment center in the
world. The debate over the role of Alcoholics Anonymous versus the role of
professional treatment can be traced back to the first days of High Watch Farm. It
was at that time, AA's future was set to remain independent from the business of
&quot;treatment&quot; for alcoholics. Today, AA's widespread use of the Prayer of St. Francis
of Assisi is attributed to Sister Francis (Etheldred Folsom), the woman who gave the
farm to Bill W. in 1940. The colorful history of High Watch begins with Sister
Francis.&quot;

<p>
Thanks for the input. Now that is interesting. Bill Wilson established a 12-Step rehab center?
Somehow, that seems to have gotten left
out of the official history of Alcoholics Anonymous. I don't remember reading that in

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#AACOA" target="_blank"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i></a>, or

<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#PASS" target="_blank"><i>'PASS IT ON': The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached the world</i></a>, or

<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#BillW40" target="_blank"><i>Bill W. My First 40 Years</i></a>, or

<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#LoisRem" target="_blank"><i>Lois Remembers: Memoirs of the Co-Founder of Al-Anon and Wife of the Co-Founder of Alcoholics Anonymous</i></a>,

<p>
or even any of the biographies of Bill Wilson like
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Thomsen" target="_blank"><i>Bill W.</i>  by  Robert Thomsen</a>, or

<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hartigan" target="_blank"><i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>
 by  Francis Hartigan</a>, or

<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Raphael" target="_blank"><i>Bill W. and Mr. Wilson &#8212; The Legend and Life of A.A.'s Cofounder</i>  by  Matthew J. Raphael</a>.

</ol>
<p>
Everybody seems to have forgotten that Bill Wilson went into the rehab business.
No wonder he died rich.  Funny how everybody forgot that important detail.

<p>
So Bill didn't bother to mention the fact that Sister Ignatius gave him a farm for free?
<p>
And then Bill Wilson set up a profitable treatment center where he sold Dr. Frank Buchman's
cult religion as a quack cure for alcoholism?  Outrageous.

<p>
That kind of contrasts with Bill's bragging about how A.A. members help others with no
thought of the profit motive.
<p>
So it looks like Bill's schemes came to fruition after all:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Dr. Bob very much liked the idea of a book. But when it came to paid
missionaries and profit-making hospitals he was frankly dubious.
Promoter that I was, I shared few of his fears. I felt that we
would have to have money and maybe a lot of it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 145.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And the hypocrisy and denial in that web site is really monumental:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;The debate over the role of Alcoholics Anonymous versus the role of
professional treatment can be traced back to the first days of High Watch Farm. It
was at that time, AA's future was set to remain independent from the business of
&quot;treatment&quot; for alcoholics.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is nothing &quot;independent&quot; about the Founder and High Priest of
Alcoholics Anonymous going into the 12-Step rehab business.
What was really established there was the deceitful tradition of
&quot;Two-Hatters&quot;, people who were both secretly &quot;anonymous&quot;
members of A.A., and also professional salesmen of &quot;treatment for
alcoholism&quot; that supposedly really works.
Can you say, &quot;Conflict of Interest&quot;?

<p>
Thanks again for the information.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Mightn't there be such as a thing as contempt subsequent to investigation? In my

Hello again, Richard,
<p>
Thanks for the link.

<p>
Yes, there is &quot;contempt subsequent to investigation&quot;. That's what I have.
We have talked about that a few times.
(Like <a href="orange-letters113.html#contempt" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
I didn't really have a lot of contempt for A.A. until after I had spent
a few years investigating, watching, learning, and seeing what was really going on.
But as I watched the true-believer fools repeating the same old lies to
new victims year after year, my contempt grew.
<p>
And when the true believers stubbornly refused to learn anything, or even to discuss
the issues honestly, my contempt really grew.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

<p>
.....is me!

<p>
****OK, I failed miserably in keeping this brief, but at least it's somewhat
sarcastic, though I can do much better. I failed by the point I had intended
to work up to, I'm dead tired....my main point is to share my own personal
discoveries while thanking yours and extolling them highly. Which proves my
main point in LIFE, that critical thinking and certain institutions do not
go together, a view you obviously share and do a GREAT job of putting into
words for the world to see. I am new at the &quot;talking about how damned pissed
I am about the crap I had to go through&quot; part of this, so please, I beg you,
forgive me for the rants I couldn't help but type out. I could've done a lot
worse, and given you MUCH more text to just ignore here! That said, I in NO
way expect a reply or certainly not a timely reply here....and I also didn't
even include the things I am actually (unsuccessfully, as no one wants to
TOUCH this subject it seems) seeking legal representation to fight, save the
problem of being left with no doctors who'll accept me within a 30 mile
radius of my home &#8212; a bit of a problem for me, seeing as I have one of the
best insurance plans out there that almost all primary care physician's
offices take.

<p>
I might just start a blog to vomit up my absurd rehab stories on, but until
finding your site, I honestly thought I was alone and opening myself up to
attack with no defenders out there if I did so. I didn't even mention my
feelings to family or friends, to be honest, until this week. Your site
provided such a huge catharsis for me personally (not spiritually, heh heh)
that I feel finally that these conclusions &amp; inklings even that I have had
for over a year are at least valid, if not entirely correct. Thank you SO
very much again, and please, read as much at your leisure (if at all) as you
can. This is not urgent)-Lex*****

<p>
I am going to try (I must stress that word) to keep this very brief. I can
scarcely put into words how very much I have found a happy conclusion (which
occasionally, I'll admit, does wax into utter rage!) to my presently quite
happy life since getting away from the 12 Step monopoly in your site. Good
heavens, if I'd only read this before I entered into dangerous treatment
programs, I'd be so much better off &#8212; and note, I'm once again the pretty
abstemious person I was prior to being prescribed almost illegal amounts of
opiate painkillers for two extremely painful conditions/injuries. The fact
that it doesn't ever OCCUR to me to use drugs, even around the music scene,
is not just proof to me that I'm not only NOT diseased (&amp; doomed to use
drugs and then DIE), but that I am RECOVERED. Not &quot;in recovery&quot;, not
perpetually a &quot;recovering addict&quot;, but that I went through what, prior to
reading your site, some Dr. Stanton Peele, meeting other well people on
YouTube who link to your site, etc. (I've been VERY busy in the last week &amp;
1/2) is what I called at the time &quot;phase addiction&quot;.

<p>
In fact, the only thing left of it seemed to be, after a while of people
seeing that I am back to being myself, and a sane and fully functional
person who is indeed trustworthy, yada yada yada, well, actually it came
down to two things. (Ok, I end up digressing here into anger at my own
story, sincere apologies, but I can't strike it out somehow, I'm too upset
at remembering it)

<p>
Actually, strike that also. I'll leave what I wrote below, though
unfinished, and be a bit more concise here.

<p>
1.) people not self-labeling as addicts or alcoholics but completely
indoctrinated into the 12 step subculture &#8212; but who consider themselves
VICTIMS of addicts &amp; alcoholics they'd been either married to, parents of,
involved with personally, etc. who seem obsessed with verbal abuse aimed at
forcing someone into submission, not merely to 12 step programs, but to them
personally. Any disagreement, even on subjects such as the weather, can
therefore result in accusations that  one is merely disagreeing because they
are &quot;unwell&quot;, suffering from &quot;dry drunk syndrome&quot;, etc., I'm sure you know
the rest already;)

<p>
1.a) people one has known since college who ended up in &quot;the program&quot;
and are so terribly happy that you've joined the club.....but are
disheartened and seemingly a bit distressed that you're succeeding without
still attending meetings: &quot;remember, if you have a rough day, go to a
meeting!&quot; &#8212; &quot;nah, the only rough days I have have nothing to do with
&quot;cravings&quot; or this seemingly &quot;eternal struggle&quot;, but due to real reasons, or
perhaps just a bad mood, something that naturally happens with most people
which require no meetings or drugs, etc.&quot; i.e., shit happens, get over it.

<p>
2.) the fact that some of the &quot;shit&quot; that &quot;happened&quot; to me in rehabs makes
me wake up in an angry nightmare on occasion. Yes, I know I shouldn't still
feel angry at this or that counselor or nurse who claimed repeatedly that I
was denying &quot;the fact&quot; that I'm (supposedly) an &quot;addict&quot; and therefore was
lying through my teeth when I'd get angry and say I was never &quot;doing my
klonopin&quot; and that my prescriptions for it were rather sparse, in fact. Yes,
people are in fact horrible jerks on occasion, and I am usually the type who
naturally seeks to mend fences or move on. As I said, things happen,
sometimes bad things, you cannot sink into that &amp; wallow in it. I've always
lived my life this way..... HOWEVER, I was forced into those situations, and
frankly forced by the doctors I trusted who over-prescribed opiates to me.
And by my insurance. And by a virtual monopoly on &quot;treatment centers&quot; in the
U.S. And by these people telling my family to force me or I would surely
die.

<p>
OR THE FACT THAT: regardless of the mission statements of these centers,
ones that aren't explicitly 12 step centered also do not tend to hire people
open to other treatment options and having two counsellors in charge who are
both &quot;in recovery&quot; &#8212; with the caveat that patients cannot have full
privileges or even stay in the facility if they do not attend compulsory
lectures, visits from (in one case) Cocaine Anonymous (of all people!)
members doing &quot;service work&quot; and even (I'm not making this up!)
<a href="orange-letters54.html#My_Name_Is_Bill_W" target="_blank">a biopic
about Bill Wilson starring (I think it was) James Woods</a> &#8212; yes, an entire
sappy film(!) among other tortures, including the requirement that one state
once per hour that one is undoubtedly an (incurable!) addict and/or
alcoholic and that one must SUBMIT to this fact.

<p>
Yes, I am angry. And unlike what these centers tried to brainwash me into
thinking, I do not need to &quot;make amends&quot; myself for this anger, or even to
&quot;let it go&quot;. I need to do what I've always done with my angst, turn it into
an opportunity to analyze and learn both about it, the nature of the thing
itself, and of the methods used to have led me to it. My faults are my own,
but I never needed Bill W. to tell me that. I do, in fact, have some small
measure of intelligence.

<p>
Many points have come to me that I want to list. These are ideas I
(hopefully) will be able to discuss with others and learn from myself as
well as lead others to think about, though I'm sure these have been pondered
in full measure by those already at The Orange Papers.

<p>
1.) Personal, but not always the case: I'm highly educated. My family come
also from a tradition of valuing rather highly both education and critical
thinking. In my &quot;recovery&quot; experiences, this was often held in extreme
disrepute by &quot;those in charge&quot;, and I hate to sound condescending or like a
classist here, but &quot;those in charge&quot; frequently had educations extending
outside of high school to The Big Book and little else. No &quot;Degree in
Truthology&quot; is going to be respected when the holder of such a fanciful
&quot;degree&quot; is someone usurping authority over themselves. It becomes highly
apparent among those well educated people &quot;in treatment&quot; that they have
utterly no place in this subculture (and anyone who doesn't think this is a
subculture in the sense defined by both anthropologists and sociologists is
not seeing the big picture &#8212; I hate to sound that definitive, but I believe I
can prove my case). Some are emotionally damaged enough to need some
religious revelation and seek that regardless of what they know already, and
that people in these situations are (obviously) in them at their lowest &amp;
most vulnerable points in life is one of the worst aspects of this abusive
system, IMHO. However, even those capable of any measure of critical
thinking quickly lose this ability, a well known phenomenon to anyone even
remotely versed in either cult coercive techniques or even political
movements. This is not uncharted territory (and what I've read at Orange
Papers indicates that the writer/writers (?) certainly know their subject
matter.

<p>
2.) the twists and unbelievable turns in false logic, leading to
contradiction after contradiction, is not something a person can follow
logically &#8212; as it isn't logic at all. Another common thread in revelatory
religious movements (and one you know well, obviously, but I still must
bring it up!), but the sheer fallacy of claiming to have a disease model AND
this logical failure is astounding to me &#8212; and it seems everyone discussing
and writing critically about 12 Step mentality.

<p>
3.) the logical fallacy (and outright heresy) of any idea of deifying &quot;the
group&quot; and in turn being effectively deified by other group members who
choose &quot;the group&quot; itself as their &quot;higher power&quot; (wow, I had to rewrite
that, Freudian slip? I accidentally wrote &quot;higher poser&quot; there..... not
joking....). I'm an agnostic turned Roman Catholic and in either of these
religious views I cannot fathom such a heretical idea! Nor can I reconcile
that any member of any of the major faiths, or even neo-pagans or even
Satanists, could accept that it is quite alright to be held as a &quot;higher
power&quot; with ANY measure of power over the lives of others. To Christians
this is utter heresy, yet this is a profoundly Protestant American Christian
program in influence and usually belief. Christian steppers have no problem
with this it would seem. I know no devout Muslim members of this group, but
more devout (and less devout, hey, I'm the only 1/2 Greek-American I know
who socializes with such a high number of Turks) Muslims I know whom I
confided in found this notion repellant as well. I've known a few slightly
lapsed Hindus in treatment who flatly rejected this also, though I doubt on
more superstitious grounds.

<p>
Long third point short, this is a fundamental aspect of the program. You
cannot join without it. No matter what one chooses as a higher power, the
statement is ALWAYS made that one may choose the other option of the group
itself as their &quot;higher power&quot; in a rather permanent manner &#8212; and that
therefore the members themselves are by at least some then deified. That's
enough to make atheists cringe in my view, even without the Lord's Prayer
said constantly.

<p>
This may seem petty, or contrived, but I assure you, this stumbling block
made me run screaming when combined with the quite obvious attempts to break
down any individuality (&quot;You're suffering from 'terminal uniqueness' &#8212; what,
you've never heard this term? Look it up!&quot; I did, and found that it is
confined to AA jargon. So much for that attempt on me;)

<p>
4.) the symptoms mimic the DX. What little I've read of Dr. Stanton Peele
and of The Orange Papers seem to confirm this. As resistant as I was to
everything I was told, I did (and discovered this only honestly after
reading old mail threads) finally begin to go around believing I had an
incurable disease. In that light, my problems all hinged on that diagnosis.
For a short time. No, I'm fine as are most people who get stuck like this
for a time. However, the 12 step mythos trains one to think they're not just
suffering from the primary diseases of addiction/alcoholism, but also from
every syndrome under the sun suggested by the therapists working in this
field who are in the 12 step mentality, and even some who aren't. These
people beg for psyco-ceuticals not out of craving but out of sheer terror
that these &quot;disorders&quot; and &quot;syndromes&quot; would drown them in the gutter just
as surely as their drinking had. Or that their &quot;disease&quot; had been caused by
these mental problems. I'd hate if people actually suffering from mental
illness were denied treatment or meds for them, but in my experience most
people in treatment are talked into starting these medications, not
previously DXed with anything even if they had had a
psychiatrist/psychologist. Is ANYONE in a sane and sound state of mind
coming off of using huge amounts of drugs, prescription or illicit or both,
and/or alcohol? Of course not. Should they be labelled permanently
afterwards with mental illnesses, something many treatment centers somehow
report to insurance companies, many doctors serving the patients, and
psychiatrists they talk patients' families into sending them to? AND to the
families of these patients (or at this point, really, victims?) who
sometimes fall for this farce hook line and sinker?

<p>
I was fired by so many doctors after these reports were spread from doctor
to doctor locally that I'm currently unable to HAVE a primary care
physician, though my medical insurance plan is one of the best PPOs in the
country. My insurance is investigating currently how some offices I've never
even been to even found out I went to a few rehabs. This is dangerous. I am
not a &quot;drug seeker&quot;, though when fired from one doctor in the past at the
suspicion of &quot;dependence&quot; I did probably exhibit that behavior once finding
a new doctor. Who would not, if forced off of drugs in a manner so suddenly
that my pharmacists were utterly shocked at it? Yet, even in the end, once I
had no fast option for medical care &#8212; two moves, two different cities and the
ensuing firings for suspected &quot;drug seeking behavior&quot; &#8212; I was in fact left
with no option but detox/rehab. How exactly does that treatment plan help
someone with two injuries to the trigeminal nerve? Yes, nerve pain hurts. I
healed, the pain is gone. Thank some &quot;higher power&quot; out there, but I am OK.
And therefore need nothing for the pain. Oddly enough, this phenomenon is
not unheard of in the world of medicine. And not even in the MODERN world of
Western medicine. Again, I'm stating the obvious, but everything wrong with
this 12 step monopoly on treatment centers and conventional wisdom falls
rather flat in the face of some extremely obvious statements.

<p>
5.) There is NEVER any need to force or even suggest that people all be told
they're alike and &quot;equals&quot; when their choices define them as otherwise,
especially vulnerable kids! I am sorry, but dammit, I didn't need to be
laughed at by teenagers for not enjoying the oxycontin I'd been prescribed
because I'd not crushed it up and snorted it! I didn't need to KNOW that!
I'm practically elderly by these kids standards at 36, but other teens don't
need to know that their new best friends in rehab/recovery know every meth
dealer in town! Or to meet other kids who are deemed &quot;safe&quot; by families who
aren't even close. Nothing even in terms of classism or socio economic
status here, it's just that at vulnerable times in one's life one shouldn't
be thrown in and TOLD THEY ARE IN EVERY WAY THE SAME regardless of socio
economic status to people who never have any concept of not partying half to
death in high school &amp; wasting that much time and money on illicit drugs.
There's a reason that kids in high school who do like to drink, smoke pot,
do all of this recreationally but not as a lifestyle differentiate between
SOCIAL groups. John Hughes expounded on this theme in the 80s to great Molly
Ringwald infused popular success! Don't ignore the obvious, and since you
don't already, why trust (supposedly with your LIFE?!?) people who insist on
doing just this?

<p>
6.) This IS cultural. Those of us from Greek families, or in my case Greek
and Spanish with a dash of good ole Georgia Scots-Irish (BAPTIST!) can sense
the change in the air immediately here. Especially the amazement that your
first glass of wine came at the family dinner table and was served by Dad,
who along with all of your other relatives are in fact not sodden drunken
fools unable to control themselves, but rather successful people who don't
even live up the restauranteur stereotype. Growing up in the heavily
Protestant South, this was intensified for me personally. The vast gulf
between the cultural concepts of abstaining from alcohol &#8212; COMPLETELY, or
you'll go to HAAAAIIIIL!! &#8212; and seeing it as a normal part of life (though
not succumbing to it and becoming the aforementioned sodden drunk) is rather
staggering. Especially growing up in a state where most of my school were
not fundamentalist Baptists, but there were always enough of them around to
ask, &quot;What are you?&quot; and then follow up that question with some idiocy about
how everyone in my ethnic group feeds liquor to their kids. Followed by some
uneducated rant about non-white people. No, I don't see racism at every
turn, but those so ready to jump up with their own cultural biases should at
least see my POV when I look at what I find to be a very odd attitude
regarding alcohol, sex, etc. and how that has permeated various levels of
American thinking.

<p>
7.) Finally, ok, this one is personal, but the ringleader in the
socialization at the rehab I had to LEAVE and go back to once he left was in
the freakin' Klan. I hate people who seem hell-bent on giving all
Southerners a bad name, but boy, was this guy ever working as hard as he
could to do just that. The ONLY Southerner there, he came up from N.
Carolina for &quot;drinking too much moonshine&quot;, wore nothing but camo, bragged
about how he lived down the street from KKK headquarters for his region and
ended up kicked out for sexual fraternization with the girl who wore the
&quot;Elk: The Other Red Meat&quot; sweatshirt with a target on it. Not saying I don't
like guns myself, or even my more rednecky nature, but dammit, the effing
KLAN??? Not just the klan, but BRAGGING about the damned KKK and getting
others to engage in discussions about white supremacy, and the constant
verbal slaps on the wrist I got when I'd (rarely!) mention this to my
counselor or nurses. &quot;Let go, let God&quot;, my butt! You don't let the KKK take
over a rehab, even if it's just in spirit, then punish those of us who were
offended for being bloody offended. Treat the Klansman, treat everyone else
too. Favoritism for a mother*#^@ng KLANSMAN?!?!? OK, yeah, sorry Valley
Hope, as they say on the internet you do not ALLOW, &quot;EPIC FAIL&quot;.

<p>
SO FINALLY, I come to the very issues I have spent so very much time working
for advanced degrees, and even as an undergrad in. I am going for my PhD in
linguistics. Not even socio-linguistics, mind you, that isn't my area of
study. But yes, even with intense amounts of opiate painkillers either in or
leaving my brain, throwing someone who studies language into any situation
in which language is used for manipulation is never a good idea. The idea
that inference is implied in the many bits of jargon seems anathema to these
imbeciles, though not for lack of my education.

<p>
Add to that the fact that I'm married to a cultural anthropologist &#8212; with an
added BA in Linguistics for kicks &#8212; and this set-up is a recipe for disaster.
I didn't obviously do the research personally, but his Thesis even dealt
with the use of language to create a sense of identity, to simplify, in
subcultures, namely the anti-racist skinhead subculture. Spotting these
patterns is what we do. In other areas of my life, this may make me less
accessible as a human being, but thrown into &quot;recovery subculture&quot;, I assure
you, I wanted to study them as much as they wanted to break me down and tell
me not to. So how do I direct my angst, and what do I already know, and what
can I learn further to add to my study and hopefully critique of this
DANGEROUS movement? Well, I am learning.

<p>
One area I do have already to glean from in my brain is my sometimes paltry
but much loved studies of the classical world. Particularly Homer. Ahh, I
sometimes believe the only manual one needs for humanity is The Iliad. I
won't go that far though, lest I sound like &quot;one of them&quot;. I did want to
share one aspect that permeates The Iliad and the study of it, an aspect I
return to OVER AND OVER when I think of various areas of recovery thought. I
have far too many books, alas, and few bookmarked websites! I found this,
and felt the need to share it. This is the importance of &quot;Ate&quot; in both
Ancient Greek thought and in Homer, specifically I believe here, in The
Iliad:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005153/http://mimobile.byu.edu/?m=5&amp;table=books&amp;bookid=108&amp;id=1251" target="_blank">
http://mimobile.byu.edu/?m=5&amp;table=books&amp;bookid=108&amp;id=1251</a>

<p>
The references to Ate are numerous, translated here as &quot;delusion&quot;, other
accepted uses include folly and delusional flights of fancy. The first word
of the poem is actually MHNIN &quot;menin&quot;, the same root as the English word
&quot;mania&quot;. I prefer the translation for classical purposes  of &quot;rage&quot;, though
&quot;Godlike wrath&quot; is another good one. I can never stop thinking about the
concept (or personification in Greek thought as the Goddess Ate, constantly
throwing men off track in her wanderings of exile from Mt. Olympus) of Ate
when I come across recovery stories, people, readings, whether critical or
otherwise. Alas, I digressed so much that I forgot what I had to say in the
first place! And I meant only to share the idea, not to expound on it as my
credentials are not up to par in this area &#8212; but at least I have studied more
than &quot;truthology&quot;, eh? Perhaps later.

<p>
The other thing I wanted to share, but won't go into here, is the lack of
personal responsibility on the part of the very people who claim authority
in this growing arena. Why do these people get a pass once someone dies in
misery once (it just seems to me) they see that their only option, though
that isn't true, it is what is pushed on everyone, is the 12 Step Diagnosis?
Why are these kids (in my experience they're always 18-20, though I'm
obviously no expert &#8212; YET) blamed for &quot;not getting with the program&quot; once
they usually just make one stupid mistake, fatal or not? And if it is fatal,
why does the failure rate of these institutions not get questioned to the
point of being dragged through the courts and the media? This is SHAMEFUL!

<p>
I won't go into it, but my one rehab friend the last go-round was a devout
atheist. He'd made horrible mistakes, sure. He was 18. He was also
traumatized, or at least spoke at length to that effect, by his mother's
conversion to a Christian apostolic cult church for which she moved from his
home in California to Kansas City (his father was deceased &#8212; of a heroin OD,
which everyone then told would be his fate).
<p>
...
<p>
Thank you SO very much for the web site, I've sent links to even the people
now questioning my sanity as well as those who believe that I have FOUND my
sanity. My husband is fascinated now by this bizarre subculture and what
he's able to read, and if I could get him to or get more time for him, we'd
already be doing the ethnography and research, but the future is open wide.
I really cannot thank you enough, and the fact that you present a thorough
(VERY thorough and easily linked, too!) medium for reading about this is
more than I thought possible and highly enjoyable. I hate for anyone to bend
to the opposite extreme claiming that if there is no disease and only bad
choices then the addicts/alcoholics are therefore to blame for everything, I
have seen this on comments online elsewhere, but I think your approach is
free from such nonsense. I mean, if everyone was to blame for stupid
mistakes, imagine the heaps of damnation on people for choosing horrible
lovelives. I see it rather in the same vein, just with (usually) worse
results, and with my best friend, a straight-edge old school punk &#8212; and
geographer &#8212; who is recovered from a horrid marriage, well, we're about even
as life results go.

<p>
Hope you're doing well, hope I can be of help in any way in this activism
you have spearheaded here, and please let me know if I can do anything at
all!

Subject:  	Forgot! Another Huge Fallacy of Logic<br>

<p>
Sorry, had to mention this bit I forgot here, &amp; I really will be brief, as
these steppers are apparently trying to stomp me at YouTube... luckily I
don't take YT comments sections that seriously.... lol

<p>
OK, the entire premise of AA/NA/etc. as first presented to newcomers, the
supposed reason for their genesis (though you know more on this subject than
they or most others do), is that this hopeless drunk named Bill failed at
stopping drinking until he came up with his own method. Logically, if it is
a good thing for someone to create their own way of getting and staying
sober (though I realize now that Bill W. did not), then WHY, oh God, WHY is
it so necessary to stay in ONLY Bill &amp; his pal's &quot;program&quot; to do this
oneself and a horrible sin to do it on one's own by one's own methods? I
realize you've spotted this fallacy, but I just couldn't restrain myself.
(and the next logical step here is that it is to keep people in this
particular program at all costs to them even unto death. But you know that
also. Just HAD TO vent it to someone who understands it.)

<p>
Ahh, bless your heart and stay prolific!

Your letter says a lot. You made a bunch of good points.
I don't want to just repeat everything that you said, so I won't.

Have a good day now.
