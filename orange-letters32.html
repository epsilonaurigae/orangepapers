Subject:  	Federal Court Decision re: AA attendance<br>

<p>
Does your site have the link re: the Federal Court decision that allows
a person to NOT attend &quot;compulsory&quot; AA meetings due to its overwhelming
religiosity? I am a DUI counselor, and have many clients who are
interested in THAT court decision. Also, what can a person do for being
&quot;resistant&quot; to a court order to ANY &quot;self-help&quot; group (even if its NOT AA)?

<p>
Thanks, <br>
John McC. <br>

Hi John,
<p>
Ah, Riverside. I lived there for a while, a lot of years ago,
and went to Terrace Elementary School and Norte Vista High School over in Arlington.
What a blast from the past.
<p>
I don't have those legal cases online, but Ken Ragge does.
Look here:
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160313215743/http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html" target="_blank">
http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html</a> &#8212; Archive of documents, including the legal
decisions that declared that A.A. was engaging in religious ceremonies,
and that sentencing someone to go to A.A. meetings was unconstitutional.

<p>
Your second question is much more interesting. Resisting all
&quot;self-help&quot; programs and treatment.
I don't think there has ever been a court case on that, and I don't think that
a defendant would legally have a leg to stand on in refusing any kind of
&quot;self-help&quot; program.
<p>
The reason is, the judge and the courts have a
whole lot of freedom when it comes to sentencing people to prison, community service,
education, work programs, compulsory mental treatment, you name it.
The judge can even make up novel new punishments to make the sentence fit the crime.
About the only things that the judge cannot do are sentence somebody to a
religion, or sentence people to cruel and unusual punishments.
Short of that, the judge in his courtroom is basically God.
<p>
The judge can make a defendant watch tear-jerker movies from Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
and the judge can make somebody listen to old alcoholics telling their tragic
stories. Somebody who objects to all self-help groups in general
just doesn't have much legal ground to stand on.
I doubt that he would get to first base with an objection like that.
<p>
Even arguing that treatment is completely ineffective isn't a good enough
objection.
It is easy to argue that prison is completely ineffective for rehabilitating
criminals, but that argument rarely keeps somebody out of prison.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	AA's Political Power<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange,
<p>
Recently, I've given up alcohol and attended multiple AA meetings to see
what they had to say there and if it was of any value.  Overall, as you
have outlined it really isn't of much value.  Their dogmatic 12 step
program is ridiculous and their Big Book is a product of a privileged
reformed alcoholic of the 30's and reflects some of the thinking of that
time as you also explain.

<p>
Why today does AA have respect and political support as a useful
organization?  I can't figure it out.  The officially sanctioned
recovery programs here in the Kansas City area apparently all support
the AA approach.  The only part of their approach that I fully agree
with is 100% abstinence.

<p>
Where can I find out more about how AA has become a respected and
applauded group of those in governmental power?  Is there some money
angle? i.e. corruption?

<p>
Thanks for your well written expose of AA.

<p>
Pat M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Pat,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
What you are asking about is one of the more amazing and fascinating
stories of 20th-century America. For 70 years now, A.A. has
relentlessly followed a clever plan of self-promotion, while sanctimoniously
declaring that it is only a program of attraction.
And they have constantly promoted their religion while declaring that it
isn't a religion and they don't want to convert anybody.
<p>
For just a few of their promotional stunts, check out these links:
<ol>
<p><li> Bill Wilson and gang used
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Hutchison" target="_blank">the New York Times book reviewer
Percy Hutchison</a>
to promote A.A. and the <i>Big Book</i> for free.

<p><li>
The early A.A. members managed to keep
<a href="orange-letters8.html#Morgan_Ryan" target="_blank">Morgan Ryan</a> sober just
long enough for him to appear on Gabriel Heatter's <i>&quot;We The People&quot;</i>
radio program and tell all of America how a wonderful new organization
called <i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i> had saved him from
alcoholism, and then Morgan promptly relapsed afterwards.

<p><li>
The June 30, 1940 financial statement of Works Publishing, Inc.
says that the original A.A. members used a variety of media outlets to
publicize the newly-published <i>Big Book</i> for free:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The following have served to effectively publicize the book and the work during the past year.
Gabriel Heater on &quot;We the People&quot; program, articles appearing in Liberty, Your Faith, Your Life, Time,
Newsweek, The New York Times Book Review, Mr. Rockefeller's dinner for Alcoholics Anonymous,
news articles on the recovery of Rollie Hemsley, catcher for the Cleveland Baseball Club,
review of the book by Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, the Cleveland Plain Dealer series of articles,
comment by Dr. Dilworth Lupton, the Washington Star series, the Houston Press, Texas newspaper
series, together with many syndicated pieces.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p><li>
Bill Wilson went on the road and
spent several years during the 1940s
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">out grand-standing and promoting
Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

<p><li>
And the promotion just never stopped.
Television and the movies always portray Alcoholics Anonymous in a positive
light, with movies like <i>&quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;, &quot;Clean
and Sober&quot;, &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;</i>,
and <i>&quot;28 Days&quot;</i>, and positive portrayals
in TV programs like <i>&quot;Cagney and Lacy&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-letters13.html#ER" target="_blank">ER</a>&quot;</i>
and
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-random.html#West_Wing" target="_blank">The West Wing</a>&quot;</i>.
Nobody on TV ever says that A.A. is actually a stupid superstitious
cult religion that is completely ineffective for treating alcoholism.

</ol>

<p>
Most people are fooled by A.A. and don't know anything about it except that
they have heard that it is some kind of club that gets alcoholics
to stop drinking and start praying, which they think must be a good thing.
<p>
A.A. has so much political power because it is a cult religion with a lot of
fanatical determined true believers (who are also anonymous and invisible)
who have deliberately gone after that
power for a long time. Many A.A. members and
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#fellow_travelers" target="_blank">fellow travelers</a>&quot;
have managed to work themselves into positions of authority in
the &quot;treatment industry&quot;, and they use the prestige of their positions
to pass off their cult beliefs as established wisdom about alcoholism.
For example, we were just recently talking about
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="_blank">Rudolf H. Moos</a>,
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">Keith Humphreys</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Prof. George E. Vaillant</a>.

<p>
In the U.S. Congress at this moment, we have Congressman Jim Ramstad (R,MN),
who is openly a non-anonymous member of Alcoholics Anonymous and a true believer in it.
<a href="orange-action.html" target="_blank">
He is constantly scheming to route more federal, state, and civilian health
insurance money into the 12-Step cult</a>.
He calls it &quot;giving alcoholics fair treatment&quot;, but what it really means is
send more money to the treatment centers that employ 12-Step true believers
and pay them to indoctrinate millions of prospective new members.
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Addition: And there is also Senator Norm Coleman, also a Republican from Minnesota, who
also openly promotes the 12-Step racket.
</font>

<p>
Is there corruption? Of course. The treatment industry is a
multi-billion-dollar game. They don't want to give up all of that money.
That last thing that they want the public to know is that 12-Step treatment
is just superstitious cult religion,
not actual &quot;treatment&quot; for a &quot;disease&quot;,
and that it doesn't work at all. There's plenty of good money to be made
selling cult religion to the suckers.

<p>
A.A. tries to make you think that its financial situation is perennial poverty &#8212;
They only pass the hat or a basket at the meetings, they say, and just barely
collect enough to cover the rent.
That is true of the little local groups, but that simply masks the other reality:
The treatment centers,
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html#TC_study" target="_blank">93% of whom foist the 12 Steps on their clients</a>,
charge anything from $10,000 to $30,000 for a 28-day stay,
during which time the agenda is to convince people that A.A. is the
only way, and that they will have to be A.A. members for life.

<p>
Those treatment centers support lobbyists who contribute to Congressmen's campaigns
&#8212; contribute a lot.
You can guess the rest of the routine.
<p>
They also support front groups like
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160313215743/http://www.ncadd.org/" target="_blank">NCADD</a>,
the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence</a>,
and
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160313215743/http://www.asam.org/" target="_blank">ASAM</a>, the American Society for Addiction Medicine,
and
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160313215743/http://www.naadac.org/" target="_blank">NADAAC</a>, National Association of
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Counselors.
</ul>
<p>
Those front groups in turn have lots of lobbyists and
talking heads who do everything they can
to promote the A.A. program and to convince people that A.A. has a working
answer to alcoholism. We were just recently talking about
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">how the A.M.A.
let a joint committee of the NCADD and ASAM write the definition of
&quot;alcoholism&quot; for the A.M.A.</a>.
The definition that they came up with is of course compatible with A.A.
theology and superstitions. The really odd thing about their definition of
alcoholism is that it does not say that alcoholism is caused by drinking alcohol.

<p>
And then A.A. uses the courts to force every drunk driver in town into
A.A. meetings. A.A. has managed to fool the judges and make them
believe that A.A. is a
successful treatment program for the &quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism. That stunt
actually predates A.A., and comes from the Oxford Group cult (as do many
of the bad features of A.A.).

Bill Wilson's own sponsor,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">Ebby Thacher, was drafted
into the Oxford Group from a courtroom</a>
where he was facing
6 months in jail for habitual drunkenness. Rowland Hazard promised to
take Ebby with him to New York and give him &quot;the religious cure&quot;.
Ebby chose cult religion over jail.

<p>
Speaking of fooling judges,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson and A.A.
have been lying about the A.A. success rate from the very beginning</a>.
That has also been a big part of the promotion &#8212;
make people think that A.A. works great, when it doesn't work at all.


<p>
And it just goes on and on. That's enough for starters, but there is still more.
<p>
Have a good day.

Orange says: Unfortunately, Patrick didn't get that answer.
Patrick is on AOL, and AOL didn't let

Maybe somebody can tell Patrick to read his answer on this web site....
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
P.S.: Patrick, that brings up another way that A.A. holds onto its political
power: censorship and suppression of dissent. The A.A. faithful go out of their way to
scream about how offended and outraged they are when someone dares to tell
the truth about their quack medicine and cult religion.
They cry that you are killing alcoholics when you tell the truth about
how the A.A. program does not help alcoholics to quit drinking.
&quot;<a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice" target="_blank">You are doing a great
disservice to those seeking sobriety</a>,&quot; they say.
<p>
A lot of media outlets find it to be just too much of a bother to have
an honest dialogue about A.A., considering the way
that any criticism of A.A. stirs up a hornets' nest of complaints.
So they don't bother.<br>
Then, most folk are left with the impression that A.A. must be a good
thing, because they don't hear anything negative about Alcoholics Anonymous.
All that they ever hear is the same old talk about how if you have a drinking
problem, you should go to Alcoholics Anonymous, where the &quot;experts&quot; will
&quot;help you&quot;.

Dear Webmaster or Postmaster:

<p>
I just received a letter from one of your members, and answered
it, and when I did, I was informed that the letter had been
rejected. I traced down the meaning of the error code, RLY:B2,
and your web site informs me that my email account has been

we have received numerous complaints concerning mail coming

<p>
I have never spammed anyone on AOL, or even written much to anyone
there, except for answering letters that come to my web site.

<p>
I run an anti-cult and anti-Alcoholics Anonymous web site, which
the more cultish A.A. members hate. Undoubtedly, some of them
have written complaints to you, falsely claiming that I have
committed some kind of offense.

<p>
Not so.

<p>
They are merely trying to sabotage freedom of speech, and squelch
dissenting voices.

From:  	&quot;Mvega&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Addiction monster<br>

<p>
Hi Orange!

<p>
First let me start by saying how great your site is!
I still haven't finished reading it all and I've been at it for a month.
Yup, you guessed it, I'm a lazy reader lol.

<p>
I agree with AA being a cult. I will be as of Feb 1st 2006 5 years
sober. I work for the Canadian military and their policy is to send
someone to rehab if they get in trouble, so off I went.
<p>
I had 28 days of brainwashing at a Toronto treatment center.
Let me begin by first saying that some people (registered therapists)
there had outright prejudice to the clients. Especially the ones that
were in supposed recovery!
<p>
That smelled fishy to me right from the start. Just like the ignorance
and stupidity that happens &quot;in the rooms&quot; happened there! (I guess the
<i>program</i> breeds ignorance). I was really in a bad way. I had gotten
myself in a <i>BIG</i> car accident. I almost lost my life. I hit my head
pretty bad.
<p>
Drugs were the culprit, or lol, I should say <i>I</i> was the culprit. Let's
not say that drugs are cunning and baffling because that simply is not
the case.
<p>
I couldn't wrap my brain around the concept of some inanimate material
thinking and conniving against me. Talk about stupidity!
Most people in AA believe it. At least the ones I've come across.
<p>
On with the story. So, part of the treatment, was to attend
&quot;aftercare&quot;. Aftercare consists of a one year attendance to a councilor
(in my case he was recovering himself), with a group of others like
myself, so that we can continue the brainwashing to better the odds of
the program sticking.
<p>
Like in AA meetings, I every time I spoke my own opinion or ideas that
didn't <i>jive</i> with BW
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson]</font>
I was shot down. This would follow up with a
couple of single <i>alone</i> sessions with the councilor to try and correct
my wrong way of thinking.
<p>
Damn it, was that ever a frustrating year. So as not to get fired, I
just went in and faked it. I wanted to keep my job. This caused great
heart ache and lowered my self esteem considerably.
<p>
It made me feel very small. After about 6 months of me &quot;faking&quot; it, the
councilor approached me and said that I was coming along surprisingly
well. He was pleased at my turn around and told me that I was working a
good program.
<p>
I have to admit that I attended AA as well. You see, the Military Base
here is situated in a very small town here and he would keep tabs on the
people that didn't go. He had AA members reporting to him about our
attendance. Part of the aftercare was to go to AA of course.
<p>
Somewhere along the line, some brainwashing did get to me and it took me
3 years to kick the AA habit!
<p>
I thought for sure I would relapse if I didn't go. What nonsense! Well,
I stopped going and I'm still sober so there! LOL!

<p>
Now on to the subject of the addiction monster.
<p>
I am in the process of writing a book, with the help of a prominent
doctor (he is in charge of the emergency department in this county), as
well as a psychiatrist and psychologist.
<p>
My book tackles issues in regards to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,
Fragmented Personality, Phobias, Re-integration of self, and various
other subjects not mentioned as it is not pertinent to this letter.
<p>
At any rate, After I showed these professionals my &quot;model&quot;, they thought
that it could <i>FIX</i> the addiction dilemma!
<p>
That was not my intent for the book. If it can help people to
permanently &quot;recover&quot; so be it.

<p>
You see, for me there is no longer an addiction monster. I have found
that he could be <i>integrated</i> to become part of me, not a separate entity.
I am aware that the lizard brain is a separate part of the brain, but
the brain is composed of all sorts of separate parts that work as a whole.
In short, I made friends with it. I made it understand that even though
it wanted to feel good (there is nothing wrong with wanting to feel
good), that it's mode of operendi was killing both of us!
<p>
I had in my case, to address it this way. It may be different for others.
You see, it is a primitive part of the brain and it works along the
level of instincts I have found, and <i>because</i> of this it was quite easy
to make it understand.
<p>
It, along with my higher self has no intentions of dying. So when <i>it</i>
finally understood the death part, it stopped. It's a much more complex
process but that's the short of it.
<p>
In dealing with myself and putting humpty dumpty back together again,
the re-integration of the lizard brain was just and added bonus I wasn't
counting on.
<p>
I was told that there was nothing I could do about it. I was told that
it was a progressive, incurable disease.
Think of it this way if you like.
<ul>
<p><li>
*If it were having fun and I didn't approve so I came along and
locked it up (we are told in AA to ignore it, they abhor dealing with
anything that BW didn't address).*
<p><li>
*Then I told it that IT would be locked away forever until I/we die.
That I would never let it out not even once!*
<p><li>
*It's safe to say that it would get quite angry and frustrated to say
the least right?*
<p><li>
*It would be waiting for the <i>chance</i> or
<i>opportunity</i> to escape! It is
my opinion that this is the progressive part of it.*
<p><li>
*Because if and when it finally got out, it would strike back with a
vengeance! NOW I'M OUT! I'M GONNA PARTY NOW!*
<p><li>
*So I told it to relax and that it would not be locked up as long as it
was not endangering our life.*
<p><li>
*/ AFTER it understood &quot;why&quot; it was killing us, it stopped. /*<br>
*//*
</ul>

<p>
He is a happy part of me today, rather I should say lol, I am happy
today. Complete, whole, not many things are locked up and put away anymore.
I still have more work to do but the majority of it is done.
Well, sorry for the rant, but that's it!

<p>
Merry Christmas Orange, and everyone!

From:  	&quot;Michael S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Correction<br>

<p>
Hi Agent Orange,

<p>
On your home page I found the following as part of a footnote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'And still, now I'm hearing that somebody else is saying that it is from
&quot;The Pathology of Trauma&quot; by Herbert Spencer, 2nd edition, Edited by
J.K.Mason, page 192. I haven't been able to get my hands on a copy of that
book to verify that. I'm at the point where I don't believe any of that
stuff until I see it for myself, so I'll go see.'<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm guessing you got this information from www.aabibliography.com

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michael,
<p>
You guessed correctly. I was browsing that site, looking for any old historic
documents that I hadn't already read, and saw the statement that
somebody had found the Spencer quote.
</font>
<p>

It's completely out to lunch. Herbert Spencer never wrote a book with that
title.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, well that explains why I was having such trouble finding a copy of it.
The local city library's inter-library loan system is excellent, and
their computers will find even the most obscure rare historical books for you.
In one case, they got me the *only* available copy of a rare old book.
&#8212; That means the <i>only</i> available copy in all of the United States and Canada.
But I got no hits on that Spencer book.
They didn't even list it as existing, never mind unavailable.
</font>
<p>

The book in question &quot;The Pathology of Trauma&quot; is a compilation of modern
expert articles on traumatic injury. It is edited by J. K. Mason, now
professor emeritus of Edinburgh University. The first edition of the book
was published in 1978 under the title &quot;The Pathology of Violent Injury.&quot;
The first edition did not include the quotation. The second edition did,
published in 1992.

<p>
I wrote to J. K. Mason to enquire about the use of the quotation. He told
me that he left it up to the contributing authors to select epigraphs for
their revised contributions for the second edition. He suggested I contact
Dr. Flynn who authored the article that uses the &quot;Spencer&quot; quotation.

<p>
I found Dr. Flynn and sent him a letter. He wrote back and told me that he
got the quotation from Appendix II: Spiritual Experience in the book
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot; When I finally found the source of the quotation
and provided him with a copy of my article, he said, &quot;I have been
embarrassed by my source,&quot; and went on to encourage me to let AA
headquarters in New York know of the error as he believed they &quot;would not
want to lead anyone astray.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Aha! It's the always same old thing, isn't it? Every time that Spencer quote is repeated,
it turns out that the source is ultimately the A.A. Big Book.
People quoting people who quoted people who quoted people who quoted the Big Book.
</font>
<p>

I summarized all this in more condensed and private terms in my article.
You can read the short segment here:<br>
<!-- a href="http://www.geocities.com/fitquotation/fitquotation03.htm#Anchor-1992-47423" -->

<font color="green">
There is now a local copy here:
<a href="Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf" target="_blank">
Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf</a>
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Cool.
</font>
<p>

The webmaster of www.aabibliography.com has been particularly obnoxious
since I announced this discovery. You will note that he failed to correct
his own error in naming Spencer as the author of &quot;Pathology of Trauma.&quot;

<p>
When I wrote to him with my discovery, he pried me for personal
information. He wanted to know my occupation, place of residence, etc. He
also cut and pasted my entire private message to him on the page he has
devoted to the quotation. I didn't like that and asked him to remove it and
just type up a generic little note. He wanted to publish my article on his
web site and make my PDF downloadable on his site as well. When I told him
I did not want him to do that, he continued to hound me. The impression I
got was that he wanted to some how take some credit for the work I had done
by being my publicity agent. It was totally ridiculous. Finally, I offered
him a suggestion of what he might write on his web page since he seemed
incapable. When I did this, he said he was more inclined to just remove any
mention of the article. I told him to go right ahead, that I had never
asked him to link to my article in the first place, and that people were
finding the article through other means. I told him that if saying nothing
about me was the only way he could find to respect me, then he should do
that and stop writing to me.

<p>
I wouldn't trust much of anything you read on that guy's web site.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, I won't.
</font>
<p>

Anyway, I just thought I'd like to clear that up for you as I'm guessing he
was the source of the rumor about &quot;Pathology of Trauma.&quot; I became very
familiar with the various rumors and ways of thinking among people online
who were asking about the quotation. Most rumors are tracable to other
Internet sources. If you picked this one up somewhere else, the source is
definitely www.aabibliography.com

<p>
~Michael

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, thanks for the clarification, Michael. That's one less detail for me
to worry about.
<p>
I was amused by the part about how the author Dr. Flynn encouraged you
'to let AA headquarters in New York know of the error as he believed
they &quot;would not want to lead anyone astray.&quot;'<br>
As if the true believers at the A.A. headquarters would ever want to
admit that Bill Wilson wrote something wrong in their holy book... :-)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day, and a happy new year.

Date:  	Wed, December 28, 2005 5:49<br>
From:  	&quot;Ryan E.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	A few questions<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I just stumbled across your site and I'm wondering. What's with the
incredible amount of virulent, hate-fueled effort you've put into
&quot;de-bunking&quot; the whole AA movement?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ryan,
<p>
Maybe I get all energized when I see friends die,
from, or at least in spite of, some cult religion's quack medicine.
</font>
<p>

I'm just curious. As a person who's working on &quot;recovering&quot; from
addiction, I've found AA and NA meetings quite useful. I'm not a
religious man and I am no moron either. What I see is a group of mostly
earnest, well-meaning people with often genuine unconditional love and
sympathy for one another. The funny thing is, going to meetings actually
DOES help people feel better. Sure, many people relapse, but thanks to
these silly little meetings they have a place to return to and continue
developing themselves and helping others.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. meetings may help true believer cult members to feel better, but
&quot;the program&quot; kills other people.
</font>
<p>

What could any feeling, compassionate human being possibly have against
a non-profit group that wants nothing more than to help troubled people
find some hope and live better lives?

<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_money_grubbing" target="_blank">
The 12-Step cult isn't non-profit</a>;
it isn't compassionate; and
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step3" target="_blank">it wants a hell of a lot more</a>
than just &quot;to help troubled people find some hope and live better lives&quot;.
You are engaging in standard stereotypical
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a>,
something that Bill Wilson said that alcoholics were good at.
</font>
<p>
You strike me as an over-intellectual, cold-hearted automaton of some
sort.
<p>
<font color="blue">
As opposed to what? A mush-brained, non-thinking hostile cult member?
</font>
<p>

I can't imagine what kind of passion and love you feel in your
life with the utter disgust you seem to have for anything that hints at
spirituality or kindness toward others.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It doesn't really matter what you can't imagine.
<p>
And I am not opposed to &quot;spirituality or kindness toward others&quot;; I
am opposed to lies and cruelty to others &#8212; cruelty like shoving ineffective
quack medicine on some very sick people.
</font>
<p>

I've read much of your site and I appreciate all the dirt you've clearly
taken enormous efforts to dig up on the AA old-timers. I think perhaps
you've missed the point though. I mean, what is with the listing of AA
finanacial arrangements for book proceeds in the early days? And you
call Bill W. insane? I don't see how this incredible effort to undermine
something that the vast majority of the world sees as a positive force
for good in society could be the product of a sane or contented individual.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I have not missed the point. <i>&quot;The Point&quot;</i> of Alcoholics
Anonymous was supposed to be to save the lives of alcoholics,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">something that A.A.
has totally failed to do</a>.<br>
And <i>&quot;The Point&quot;</i> was supposed to be &quot;grasping and developing&quot;
a spiritual lifestyle that demanded &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; (<i>The Big Book</i>, page 58),
not a lifestyle of forever parrotting Bill Wilson's lies, and minimizing and denying
all of the faults and failures of Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
The point of talking about everything from
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's financial dishonesty with the <i>Big Book</i></a>
<li>
to <a href="orange-aacoa.html#screw_Hank" target="_blank">his betrayal of Henry Parkhurst</a>
<li>
to <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">his sexual exploitation of female A.A. members</a>
<li>
to <a href="orange-otherwomen.html#To_Wives" target="_blank">his mistreatment of his wife Lois</a>
<li>
to <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's delusions of grandeur</a>
<li>
and <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>
</ul>
is to show that A.A. has always been a dishonest cult,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">founded by a raving lunatic</a>,
not a spiritual organization that helps alcoholics.
</font>
<p>

I guess I'm just trying to understand what kind of person does such a
thing? What are you trying to gain? To convince people to join you in
your over intellectualized misery? If you don't understand the value of
spirituality, especially in this day and age, then you're lost I'm afraid.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You can't understand what kind of a person would be interested in telling the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? Pathetic.
<p>
You can't understand why someone would want to criticize quack medicine that kills
sick people? What is the matter with you?
<p>
I'm not trying to &quot;gain&quot; anything. I'm just getting the truth out there,
to counteract the evil people who are busy getting <i>The Big Lie</i> out there and
<a href="orange-action.html" target="_blank">making millions in profits by selling cult
religion and voodoo medicine</a>
as a cure for alcoholism and drug addictions.
<p>
I understand the value of spirituality. One of the very first requirements for
a spiritual life is that you learn a deep respect for the truth.
You should congratulate, not condemn, someone who tells the truth, even if you
don't like what the truth is.
</font>
<p>

Let me be clear. I am technically agnostic, before you paint me as some
Bible clutching weak minded moron, but I have come to appreciate the
value of ALLOWING for some possibilities. The world is a much nicer
place with some sort of God-force/higher power in it. It's a natural
function of human beings to have some sort of moral compass or guidance.
We are doomed as a race the day we all become cold, unfeeling,
analytical pessimists with chips on our shoulders such as yourself. It's
a short road from that to base immorality and cruel self-serving behavior.

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Allowing for possibilities&quot;? What a bunch of bunk.
That is an example of the propaganda trick of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>".
It's like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, heck, it might be true. After all, it's just one person's
opinion versus another's and we don't know anything for sure.&quot;
</font>
That just isn't true.

<p>
The truth is that A.A. does not work. We have already
considered the possibility that it might work, and put A.A. to the test,
and it was a total failure:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">It increased the death rate of alcoholics</a>,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increased the rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness</a>,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">made alcoholics require more expensive hospitalizations later
on</a>,
<li>
and caused all kinds of other problems.
I believe that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">a good case can even be made</a>
that Alcoholics Anonymous also increases the suicide rate of its members.
</ol>

<p>
Heck, Alcoholics Anonymous has now had 70 years in which to prove the &quot;possibility&quot; that
it might work. All that A.A. has proven is that it is a crazy dishonest cult religion
that is completely ineffective for saving the lives of alcoholics. In fact, it drives
them crazy and raises the death rate.
<p>
Enough is enough. Time's up.
<p>
You are also using another propaganda trick there, when you say:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The world is a much nicer place with some sort of God-force/higher
power in it.&quot;</font><br>
<p>
Well yeh, but what does that have to do with Alcoholics Anonymous and recovery from
alcoholism?
<p>
That is what you call a
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">False Dichotomy</a></i>,
an attempt to make a false division, like trying to divide the
issue into those who believe in God and those who don't.
I believe in God. I just don't believe in your favorite cult religion.
<p>
I think your cult is evil. It kills people.
Lying to sick people about what might heal them is evil.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;</font>, they incant,
when the real failure rate is greater than 95%.
<p>
The world is also a much nicer place when there aren't any evil
deceptive cult religions in it, lying to and hurting people.
</font>
<p>

Just some things to think about. Feel free to respond to me in any
manner you feel appropriate. I'm hoping you'll surprise me with a
thoughtful, meaningful response rather than proving my point by merely
being acidic and harshly critical of what you clearly do not understand.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Please can the sarcasm.
(That is yet another
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm" target="_blank">standard propaganda trick</a>.)
</font>

From:  	&quot;Ryan E.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Follow-up<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I just wanted to say I do appreciate what you're trying to do here, at
least I'm trying to. I think it might be worthwhile for you to consider
though that these belief systems operate as a sort of tool to help
people reach many of the same conclusions you're eluding to with all of
your lengthy writings about AVRT and lizard-brain and what-not. The
difference is that many people like to attribute some meaning and yes
&quot;magic&quot; to the reasons behind things. This is the nature of spirituality
and it wasn't invented by Bill W. or the Nazi's or anyone else in your
bizarre and complex conspiracy theory. It's merely man's appropriately
humble acceptance that even in this modern day and age there are still
things we do not and cannot completely comprehend.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a load of bull --<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;there are still things we do not and cannot completely comprehend.&quot;
</font>
<p>
As if we are then supposed to believe that the Alcoholics Anonymous cult religion
might work in some magical, incomprehensible way that is beyond our understanding.
<p>
That is again the propaganda trick of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>&quot;:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Maybe A.A. works in ways that we don't understand.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
A.A. does not work at all.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">It has a zero percent
success rate over normal spontanteous remission</a>.
All that Alcoholics Anonymous does is steal the credit from some people who were
going to quit drinking anyway, and then crow that &quot;it made them quit drinking&quot;.

<p>
If you think that Alcoholics Anonymous really works to make alcoholics stop
drinking, then please tell me what your success rate is.<br>
<b>Out of each thousand
newcomers who come to an A.A. meeting seeking something that will help them to
quit drinking, how many of them are still around and sober a year later?
Ten years later?</b>
<p>
Please answer that question honestly before making any more assertions that
&quot;A.A. works&quot;.
<p>
(And no excuses are allowed, and no
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Lying With Qualifiers</a>, like
&quot;Well, they didn't <i>really try</i>&quot;, or
&quot;Well, they didn't <i>thoroughly</i> follow our path&quot;.)
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(By the way, I have never ever had a single Stepper honestly answer that question.
That says a lot about the phony &quot;spirituality&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous.
They just won't tell the truth about the important things.)
</font>
<p>
That's very clever
that you can point to the part of your brain where this addictive voice
comes from. Good for you. Some people like a little more meaning than
that. For many people cold, clincal psychology and biology may explain
the reasons behind addiction, but they offer NOTHING to inspire people
to overcome it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is just so much nonsense.
Knowledge can be of value without &quot;inspiring people&quot;.
A.A. also fails to give people a reason to live.
It is much better at giving them
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">reasons to commit suicide</a>.
</font>
<p>

I feel that's what you're missing here, perhaps.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney.
<a href="orange-letters31.html#lizard_brain" target="_blank">See this previous letter</a>,
where we talked about that very thing.
</font>
<p>

For all of your ramblings, the fact is AA and NA and this silly cultish
hocus-pocus you are so fond at picking apart will and has positively
affect(ed) the lives of more people than your webpage and AVRT and SMART
(perfect name for a program for people who imagine themselves too
intellectually superior for 12 step programs) ever will in the tiny drop
in the bucket they represent.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is simply not true. A.A. is a total failure with a zero percent success rate,
above
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg" target="_blank">normal spontaneous remission</a>.
A.A. even
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">drives people to suicide</a>.
</font>
<p>
The truth is, like it or not, more people
are affected by a message that includes a spiritual element and promotes
virtues like helping others (real Hitler-like that) versus dry, clinical
analysis taliored for athiests in love with their own intellects. See,
most people on this planet do beleive in some kind of God I've
discovered.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, another Stepper is pulling Bill Wilson's underhanded trick of
accusing everyone who disagrees with him of being an agnostic or an
atheist. I am neither an agnostic nor an atheist. I just don't like
lying cult religions that deceive people in matters of life and death.
</font>
<p>
What's more, there may actually be a good reason for doing
so. A world without meaning, rhyme or reason is an ugly place to live. I
don't readily buy into the concept of a God in the traditional sense,
but unlike you I can clearly recognize the value of opening my mind to
the idea and accepting some possibilities.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What &quot;meaning, rhyme or reason&quot; do you get from parrotting the lies of 
a cult religion?
<p>
Open your mind? To what? Lies, deceptions, and propaganda tricks?
</font>
<p>

I think you may have begun with what could have been an objective
analysis of AA, but at some point it degraded into a maniacal diatribe
citing Nazi's and reaching out in every possible direction possible to
cast AA in a negative light. For all of your clever writing about
arguments, you lost your OWN objectivity somewhere in the mix. Maybe you
should go back and read your own stuff again.

<p>
<font color="blue">
At some point, I think I grew impatient with the massiveness of the A.A. Big Lie.
I also became angry when I saw just
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">how cynical and callous
the real A.A. leaders are</a>,
and how little regard they actually have for the lives of alcoholics as
they continue to
<a href="orange-letters30.html#unscientific" target="_blank">repeat their lies about what
works to save alcoholics from death</a>.
</font>
<p>

Again. You can construct all the negative statistics you like about AA.
The fact is that it has probably positively affected more peoples lives
than your cynical view and AVRT and SMART ever will because they are
incomplete approaches (being devoid of spiritual weight to inspire people)

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Probably</i>? Now that is the propaganda trick of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot;.
<p>
What is &quot;probable&quot; &#8212; in fact, highly likely &#8212;
is that A.A. has killed far more alcoholics than it has ever helped.
</font>
<p>

If you doubt the power of spirituality, you need to open your eyes.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Get off it. Religious bigotry will get you nowhere.
I am not an atheist, and I do not doubt the value of spirituality.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a spiritual organization. It is a superstitious,
dishonest, lying cult religion.
<p>
If you want to actually be spiritual, you should start with learning to love the truth,
and start telling the truth, instead of yammering so much deceptive propaganda,
and complaining about how I reveal all of those ugly old truths that you really
didn't want to hear about.
</font>
<p>
Atheist, agnostic or otherwise, it's undeniable and while AA's approach
may be a bit anachronistic in the 21st century, for all your words,
you've failed to introduce any viable alternative that will work for
anyone.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. You should learn to read before opening mouth.
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works" target="_blank">Read this</a>.
</font>
<p>
You see, in order to be successful a program needs to be
accessible to the everyman as well. The homeless guy sleeping in the
bushes doesn't have an internet connection so he can go through the
little AVRT HTML slide show and even if he did, do you REALLY think
something like that or SMART is going to inspire MOST people?

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you think that having lots of A.A. meetings available in every city
makes A.A. work?
<p>
Well A.A. just does not work, so please quit trying to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a>.
(That's yet another propaganda trick.)
<p>
Scientology also has offices in every city, and the Scientology cult
is available to millions of people.<br>
Does that mean that Scientology really works good to cure mental illnesses
and <a href="orange-cult_q5.html#Narconon" target="_blank">alcoholism and drug addictions</a>?
<p>
A.A. also does not inspire people, other than a few crazy cult members who
get all emotional over hearing their favorite superstitions repeated.
</font>
<p>

I think what you've done, at best, is uncover some passable, though
incomplete alternatives with tiny communities, suitable for diehard
intellectuals who hate AA with a vengenance and fight any idea of a
power greater than mankind tooth and nail.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Are you trying to suggest that cult religion works better than something that is true?
<p>
And again, you are using two more propaganda tricks:
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a></i> and
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">False Dichotomy</a></i>,
when you yammer about
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;diehard intellectuals who hate AA with a vengenance and fight any idea of a
power greater than mankind tooth and nail.&quot;</font>
<br>
It isn't <i>&quot;the atheistic intellectuals versus the faithful believers&quot;</i>.<br>
It's <i>&quot;the cult religion nut-cases versus the sincere healers who tell the truth&quot;</i>.
</font>
<p>

Not such a staggeringly great accomplishment as your word count might
suggest, but so be it. You could have accomplished all that without the
frightening amount of effort devoted to discrediting AA by attacking the
personalities from it's past.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Those &quot;personalities from it's past&quot; are the criminals who created that fraud &#8212;
you know, &quot;The Founders&quot;. They deserve to be criticized. They have gotten
a lot of suffering people killed with their lies.

[3rd letter from Ryan E.:]
<p>

Date:  	Thu, January 5, 2006 2:13<br>
From:  	&quot;Ryan E.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: A few questions<br>

<p>
Thanks for taking the time to reply so thoroughly. I'm still a bit
confused as to where you are getting the statistics that indicate
massive failure of the AA program. I do think there is merit to some of
your criticisms of AA though, I don't accept it all as gospel truth and
without flaws. However I think that when I go to meetings and constantly
come across people with 10, 15, 25 and more years of sobriety, that is
some indication of success. I imagine you'd credit them with sobering
themselves up and give no credit to the program at all though.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, when I run into someone with that many years of sobriety, I give the
credit to them, not to some program.
<p>
Where do the statistics about the dropout rate come from? Well, from the
A.A. headquarters for starters.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">Look here</a>.<br>
Also look at
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">this analysis</a>
of the results of A.A. triennial surveys.<br>
And then I just recently got some sales figures for A.A. sobriety coins.
Guess what? For every 1000 of the 1st-day coins that they give away, they only
give away 31 of the 10-year coins.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
[CORRECTION: That A.A. success rate, 31 per thousand, is way too high.
I miscalculated it by getting some Narcotics Anonymous information
mixed with the A.A. information.
The real A.A. success rate is only 11 or 12 10-year old-timers per 1000
newcomers.
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">See this letter</a>.]
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
By the way, when I asked about the A.A. success rate, you responded by saying
that you have seen a bunch of people with 10, 15 or 25 years of sobriety.
That is not an answer. That is not a rate. A rate is &quot;something per something else&quot;,
like <i>miles per hour</i>, or <i>miles per gallon</i>, or
&quot;sober oldtimers per 1000 newcomers&quot;.
<p>
The
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">
normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics</a> is about 5 percent per year.
That means 5 newly-recovered sober people per 100 alcoholics, per year.
That's how many people just quit drinking because they get sick and tired of
being sick and tired. They quit alone, on their own, without any &quot;support group&quot;
or &quot;treatment program&quot;.
The
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School says so</a>.
<p>
In order to claim some kind of success &#8212; to claim that A.A. actually sobers up some
drunks &#8212; A.A. has to do better than the normal rate of spontaneous remission.
It doesn't. All that A.A. does is try to steal the credit for the few people who
were going to quit anyway. (That's why they went to A.A. in the first place &#8212; because
they had decided to quit drinking.)
</font>
<p>

By your estimation every alcoholic that attends some meetings and
relapses is a victim of the program rather than their addiction
(regardless of whether or not they actually try to work the program as
intended or not) and anyone who succeeds while attending meetings
regularly succeeds in spite of the program, not because of it.
<p>
I don't see how you can have it both ways.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
No. You are mixing apples and oranges.
There is a big difference between quack medicine and a quack doctor.
When quack medicine fails to cure people, those people are victims of the quack
doctor, not victims of the medicine.
<p>
When people go to A.A. meetings and &quot;work a strong program&quot; and still don't
get and stay sober, then the program has failed. But those people are not &quot;victims&quot;
of the program. They may be victims of lying A.A. recruiters or sponsors, though.
<p>
Again, the numbers of people who succeed in getting sober inside A.A. is
just equal to the normal rate of spontaneous remission of alcoholics,
so A.A. can't claim to have made those people quit.
If A.A. really made people get sober, then it should have a success rate greater
than doing nothing for the alcoholics. It doesn't.
Its success rate is just the same as, or actually less than, doing nothing for the alcoholics.
</font>
<p>

I'm willing to admit the program is not without flaws, but I don't see
how you can write the entire thing off as worthless. I'm sorry you've
seen people die despite trying to work the program (only you know how
much effort those people actually put into it) The truth is if you are
an alcoholic and you associate with other alcoholics, you will see
people relapse and you will see people die. Do you honestly beleive that
these people would be better off having no program at all and being left
to their own devices and expected to engineer their own recovery with
some self-help books and no guidance or fellowship like AA?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I can write A.A. off as worthless because it is a lying cult religion
that hurts people. I write A.A. off just like how I write off Scientology
and the Moonies, for many of the same reasons. (In fact, the only big
difference between A.A. and those other two cults is that A.A. isn't as
agressive in going after people's money. But the 12-Step treatment centers are.)
<p>
When you ask,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Do you honestly beleive (sic., sp.) that
these people would be better off having no program at all&quot;</font>,
you are pulling the propaganda stunt called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">The <i>Either/Or</i> Technique
&#8212; Bifurcation &#8212; the Excluded Middle</a>.<br>
It isn't a matter of EITHER Alcoholics Anonymous OR no help at all.
I am all for other programs that might actually help the alcoholics.
Maybe we could start with a program that really tells the truth to
the alcoholics, just for starters.
</font>
<p>

I definitely believe it doesn't work for everyone and it's flawed in
ways as are some of the personalities involved in it's inception, where
you and I differ I think is that I still believe there is a lot of good
that can come from objective character analysis of one's self, going to
meetings to share with other alcoholics and finding out what works for
them and having a sponsor. You can participate in all that without
joining a cult or becoming a religious nut or thinking AA is without flaws.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It does not work at all. It is a cult. It lies like a rug. It deceives alcoholics
and feeds them a load of misinformation about alcoholism and addictions.
</font>
<p>

As adept as you seem to be at deconstructing the arguments of others, I
really don't see how you can think you are offering a better
alternative. Suggestion 1: Just don't drink?, cost-benefit analysis?,
lizard-brain?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, whether you like it or not, those things have a better track record
than Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

All of these things you suggest appear to be nothing more than variants
on the very concepts you read about in the big book and hear in
meetings. I don't see what you've done aside from take them out of the
spiritual context that the &quot;cultish&quot; aspects of AA imbue them with. The
AA way is definitely a bit antiquated, but I think the spiritual flavor
that glues the whole program is what lends this stuff weight. It drives
home the seriousness of the problem and demands that people make it a
priority and dedicate themselves to actually applying these principles.
I don't see how boiling the very same ideas down to their basic essence
and perhaps taking a slightly different tack on some of them delivers a
better alternative.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, those &quot;things I suggest&quot; are not like Alcoholics Anonymous:
<ul>
<li>
I don't tell people that some ghost will solve all of their problems for them.
<li>
I don't tell people that they are nasty sinners who must get on their
knees and confess to me.
<li>
I don't tell people that alcoholism is caused by
<a href="orange-secrets.html#cause_list" target="_blank">sins, defects of character,
moral shortcomings, and nagging wives</a>.
<li>
I don't tell people that they are powerless over alcohol.
<li>
I don't tell people to conduct s&eacute;ances
and get secret messages from 'Higher Power' like A.A. Step 11 does.
<li>
And I don't demand that people surrender control of &quot;their wills and their lives&quot;
to 'Higher Power' and his cult like A.A. Step 3 does.
<li>
And I don't tell people to fib to the newcomers and withhold the truth &#8212; to
only dole out the truth about the program by
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">teaspoons, not buckets</a>&quot;.
</ul>
There is little or no similarity between the things that I suggest and Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

What is the difference between &quot;lizard-brain&quot; and seeing your addiciton
as a diseased part of the mind that you need to combat, for example.
Your method may be more scientifically accurate but without a program of
some kind to tie all these alternative ideas you've listed together it
is left up to the individual to find some way to see it all working
together and see that it REALLY matters and apply themselves to it.
They've got to do that without any kind of guidelines or goal posts of
any kind. Please explain to me why you feel that lack of structure is
going improve the odds of success for the average person?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Lack of structure? So now you are trying to claim that the heirarchical
power structure of A.A. is a necessary evil? You are now only one step
away from fascism, you know &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Yassuh, bozz man. All dem nasty little alkies needs
a massuh to whip dem and make dem behave.&quot;</font>
<p>
And again you are trying to use the Either/Or propaganda trick. It isn't
EITHER A.A. OR nothing.
<p>
It's more a matter of: &quot;Let's toss A.A. into the trash can and put together
a better program. With $15,000 to $30,000 per alcoholic, like the Betty Ford
Clinic and Hazelden get, we should be able to do much better than them.&quot;
<p>
I'm not recommending that the alcoholics get no program or no treatment or no help.
I'm recommending that they get something better. Something that actually works,
just for a change.
</font>
<p>

It's easy to find things wrong with AA and to pick the negatives apart
with a cynical eye but the alternatives you offered amount to not much
more than common sense and I think most people have that already. That
hasn't kept them from suffering as alcoholics. I think it's the simple
comradarie of AA combined with an actual plan laid out on paper with
texts tying it all together that give people something of substance to
work with. Compare that to a bunch of bullet points posted by some guy
on the Internet.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Haven't you heard the old saying that there is nothing as uncommon as common sense?<br>
Even geniuses can become alcoholics or drug addicts.
<p>
Get it through your head that when A.A. was put to the test, NO TREATMENT was better
than Alcoholics Anonymous. Dr. Brandsma found that after several months of
A.A. indoctrination,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
the A.A. group was doing 5 times as much binge drinking as
the no-treatment group</a>, and 9 times as much binge drinking as a group that
got Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
<p>
It would be very hard for me with my &quot;common-sense suggestions&quot; to do as badly
as Alcoholics Anonymous.
Even no treatment is better.
It's so obvious &#8212; telling alcoholics that they
are powerless over alcohol becomes a self-fulfilling prediction.
</font>
<p>

I guess perhaps we won't see eye-to-eye on this. I respect the amount of
effort you've put into your research, though I still question your
conclusions that AA is a total failure. It seems odd that you are one of
a few voices in the wilderness making this claim, meanwhile the rooms I
attend are full of people with 10, 15, 25+ years of sobriety and lives
turned around by the program. Are all those people figments of my
imagination? Are they delusional for believing a program that forced
them to develop discipline and scrutinize their own character and
overcome weakness may have actually helped them become better people? I
just don't see how AA is a cult religion when it asks nothing of people
except to improve their character and stay sober. Where is the evil you
are seeing here?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are using the logical fallacy of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">assuming a cause and effect
relationship</a> where none exists.
Sure you are seeing a few sober oldtimers. Far fewer than there should be.
There is no evidence that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;their lives were turned around by the program&quot;</font>.
I would suggest that their lives were improved by their decision to
quit drinking, and then really doing it.
The 12 Steps won't improve your life if you don't quit drinking, will they?

</font>
<p>

You make some convincing arguments, but you weaken them by revealing
your own resentments about friends who've died as a result of alcoholism
(you clearly blame the program for their deaths and that calls your
motivations and credibility into question)  Anger is not the place to
start a well-reasoned argument from. You've got a great mind, that's
clear. Imagine if you channeled all that energy into positive efforts
toward helping alcoholics rather than a scary, fiery hatred toward all
things AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I can see that AA might not be for everyone, but everything I've seen
indicates that people can and do benefit from it and people who fail
would have failed with or without AA and if they can't grasp something
as simple as the 12 steps they are unlikely to piece together the
disjointed suggestions and bullet points you present and turn them into
something that works to keep them sober for the rest of their lives.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Everything you have seen?&quot;
</i></font>
You must have blinders on. What about the hundreds
of people who come and are appalled by what they see, and don't come back?
A.A. didn't help them, did it?
<p>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;People who can't grasp something as simple as the 12 Steps?&quot;</i></font>
That's two more propaganda tricks &#8212;
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#frame_argument" target="_blank">Framing the argument</a>, and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assuming the Major Premise</a>.
Actually, people do understand the 12 Steps. They clearly see that it is a plan

<a href="orange-letters32.html#horrified" target="_blank">they are horrified</a>.
<p>
It's you who can't see
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">the true nature of the 12 Steps</a>.

</font>
<p>

Why do you think it is that the majority of the world and most of the
U.S. court system believes this program works, at least better than any
alternatives out there? Is everyone in a delusional fog, hypnotized by
the cult until they read all of the hyper-critical negative stuff on
your webpage?

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. has been promoting itself for 70 years now, and has quite a
propaganda mill running full blast. Treating alcoholism and addictions
is a $6.2 billion industry in the USA, and the Steppers don't want to give up
that kind of money. They will keep the river of lies running forever
for that money.
<p>
We just discussed the answer to that question in another letter.
<a href="orange-letters32.html#political_power" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>
<p>

I don't see how you can write a billion words on the evils of AA and
then, with a straight face, offer up a list of silly bullet points as
your only alternative. You've got to have more than that to regulate
your life and get to the root of what is causing you the pain and
discomfort in your own skin that drives you to drink in the first place man.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is so bad that I could offer up a list of NOTHING and it would still
be better for the alcoholics than the A.A. cult religion.
Heck, I could do meetings with the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#patty_cake" target="_blank"><i>Patty-Cake Treatment Program</i></a>
and it would get a greater success rate than Alcoholics Anonymous.
Fewer would binge drink, and fewer would die. And fewer would waste their
lives yammering the brain-dead slogans of a cult.
And fewer would

I still question the validity of the studies you are citing. Everyone is
different, every AA group is different. I have been to mediocre groups
where there were people that didn't seem to be really committed, then I
have been to other meetings where more than half the room had 5 years or
more sober. You know as well as I do that statistics can be used to
prove either side of almost any argument. If you were able to cite
multiple studies that were done with scientifically valid numbers of
people, say several thousands of people in different meetings all over
the country compared demographically similar people outside of AA, with
their lives tracked over DECADES years or more, THEN you might have
something that could persuade people who unlike you, don't already have
a healthy hatred for AA because they bristle at the God concepts and the
whole surrender thing.

You don't like the results of the best and most valid medical and scientific
tests that have ever been done on Alcoholics Anonymous?<br>
So you demand even bigger tests?
<p>
That is just an attempt to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#unreasonable_demands" target="_blank">weasle out of it
by making unreasonable demands</a>.
You don't want to know the truth, so you set the bar so high that no tests
ever done will meet your demands.
<p>
The tests that have been done by doctors like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Brandsma</a>,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Ditman</a>,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Walsh</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Orford and Edwards</a>
are far, far, better and more valid than any of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's lies
about the A.A. success rate</a>.
<p>
Speaking of weasle out of it, you still have not answered the question about
the A.A. success rate. You dodged the question by complaining about some tests
that you don't like.
<p>
So once again: <font color="#9F0000"><b>What is the A.A. success rate?</b></font>

</font>

<p>
As far as the simpler, secular programs you suggested, I tried Rational
Recovery myself a few years ago. I, like you and your followers, was
initially turned off by the idea of surrender and the religious
undertones of AA. Rational Recovery and isolating my alcoholic/addict
voice (&quot;it&quot;) worked for about THREE WEEKS for me, then I was drinking
again. Great program there. Now, that's only my experience, but that
program was far too simple and without spiritual substance so it just
didn't stick. It was a near total failure as far as I was concerned. AA
has helped me sober for about 90 days to date.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Your anecdote is meaningless garbage. &quot;It&quot; didn't work at all. You decided to
abstain from alcohol for 3 weeks, and then you changed your mind and decided
to drink alcohol.
So what?
</font>
<p>

The emotion and biting sarcasm all your arguments are peppered with
really hurts your credibility. You come across as a bitter person with a
score to settle. I'm sure you will tell me you don't care what I think.
It is only my opinion, but I assume the purpose of your website is to
convince people, is it not? If you want to do anything other than
&quot;preach to the choir&quot; I suggest you consider tempering the sarcasm and
opinion and stick closer to facts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What's the matter? Can't you understand why I feel anger at quacks who kill my friends?

</font>
<p>

Perhaps you feel that the handful of small sample studies of very
limited scope aren't enough to make your point and that's why your
&quot;book&quot; is 99% angry, insane rambling about Hitler and fascism and cult
religion and 1% scientific data.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. There are a zillion more true facts in my web pages than there are in 
Bill Wilson's <i>Big Book</i>.
</font>
<p>

I anticipate your response will shift the burden of proof to AA and to
say that AA should have to produce the proper scientific evaluations to
prove their success, so I'll counter that now. AA doesn't have to prove
its success to people with an expensive study because the vast majority
of society has clearly seen some effect from it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, considering that Bill Wilson and A.A. have been making grandiose
claims of success for 70 years now, and A.A. has still not shown
any success rate, it's about time for A.A. to put up or shut up.
</font>
<p>

Put yourself outside yourself for a moment. What is more likely? That
nearly the entire world has been fooled for 60+ years by an insane cult
that is actually worsening the recovery rate of alcoholics, despite
mountains of anecdotal evidence to the contrary?  Or... that a bitter,
highly opinionated raving madman with a chip on his shoulder  who has to
publish his &quot;book&quot; on the Internet because no publisher would ever take
it seriously has figured out all the answers and everyone else is dead
wrong?

<p>
<font color="blue">
What is most likely is what has actually happened. A.A. is a very successful cult.
(But then again, so was Frank Buchman's Oxford Group.) Shit happens. Cults happen.
</font>
<p>

Try answering the question, rather than identifying which flawed
argument &quot;method&quot; you think I used there. It's alot more challenging,
but I'm sure you're up to it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
If you would quit using propaganda tricks and logical fallacies, then I wouldn't
have to call you on it.
</font>
<p>

Are all the psychiatrists and other mental health experts who run most
treatment centers deluded as well? Are you just THAT much smarter than
the rest of the world that only you have figured this out?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. You are way over-generalizing. Many of the best doctors in
the world recognize that A.A. is a cult with a terrible failure rate.
Go read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</a> again.
You were just complaining about all of those tests that were done by doctors,
and now you are trying to claim that the doctors say that A.A. works?
<p>
Wrong.
<p>
Oh, and many of those so-called &quot;treatment centers&quot; are not run by doctors.
That's one of the big problems with them.
They are run by A.A. members who think that a few years of A.A. meetings
makes them qualified to be recovery counselors.
</font>
<p>

You're way to smart not to see how this sounds. The truth is AA is not
for everyone.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape via Relativism</a>.
</font>
<p>

For people who are unwilling to accept the idea that there
is anything in the universe greater than themselves and resistant to
some humbling, character-building exercises, there are some other
options which you have explained.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">False Dichotomy</a>:
It isn't a matter of the spiritual believers versus the atheists.
It's a matter of the dishonest cult members versus those people who are truthful
and realistic about alcoholism and addictions.
<p>
If you insist on continuing to use those propaganda tricks, I'm going to
continue to call you on them, no matter how much you complain about it.
</font>
<p>

I think the number of people you see
in all the AA alternatives versus AA are a clear illustration of what
holds greater appeal and what is working for people.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again.
You are using both
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank"><i>Petitio Principii</i>, Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a>
and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">Observational Selection</a>.
You are trying to imply that all of the people who are recovering from alcoholism
are to be found in A.A. meetings.
You only go to A.A. meetings, so you only see A.A. people recovering, so
you assume that only A.A. people are recovering. Wrong, totally wrong.
<p>
The truth is that the vast majority of people who successfully quit drinking do it
without Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Medical School says</a>
that 80% of all of
the people who quit drinking for a year or more do it alone, on their own,
without any treatment program or any &quot;support group&quot;.

<p>
So four out of five successful sober people prefer some other method than cult religion.
That should be &quot;a clear illustration of what
holds greater appeal and what is working for people.&quot;
</font>
<p>

If Rational
Recovery and &quot;lizard brain&quot; are as effective as you claim then I beleive
you will be vindicated and they will replace 12 step as the prefered
method of treatment. Time will tell.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, time will tell. And in the interests of bringing the future here sooner,
let's get the whole truth out there for everyone to see, including the A.A.
failure rate and the entertaining Nazi history of Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups.
</font>
<p>


In the meantime, you could better
serve your cause by toning down your own rhetoric to make your seething
anger and spite towards AA a little less obvious, it would go a long way
towards convincing people to seriously consider your point of view, just
a friendly piece of advice. Cut out the absurd Hitler, fascism and cult
religion references in every other sentence, they really make you sound
like a delusional conspriacy theorist.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Absurd, huh? That one gets to you, doesn't it? That is all real documented history.
The truth. The real roots of Alcoholics Anonymous. Bill Wilson and Doctor Robert
Smith were both such enthusiastic members of the Oxford Group that they didn't
even quit in protest when the leader Frank Buchman came back to New York from the Berlin Olympics
and declared, &quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler!&quot;
<p>
Wouldn't you have quit in protest? How do you explain away Bill Wilson's and Dr. Bob's
failure to do so?
</font>
<p>


Hey, if you weeded that nonsense
out and reprocessed all that text into a comprehensible, organized
format you might even be able to get your work published so that it
could reach more people instead of just the kind of people who get their

[4th letter from Ryan:]

<p>

Date:  	Fri, January 13, 2006<br>
From:  	&quot;Ryan E.&quot;<br>
Subject:<br>

<p>
[from previous letter:]<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
&quot;What is your success rate? Out of each thousand newcomers who come
to an A.A. meeting seeking something that will help them to quit
drinking, how many of them are still around and sober a year later?
Ten years later?&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I just wanted to address your question more directly. I think your
asking the wrong question. That is like saying out of each thousand
people that visit a psychologists office, how many turn their lives
around 10 years later.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I think it's the right question.<br>
In fact, it's the single most important question of all.<br>
It's a matter of life or death for a lot of people.
<p>
A.A. is of no use at all if it doesn't keep people from dying of drink.
<p>
All of the talk about the wonderful &quot;spirituality&quot; or
&quot;fellowship&quot; that A.A. supposedly offers is just irrelevant mindless
prattle compared to the question of who sobers up and lives versus who dies.

<p>
And again, I see that you are just dodging the question, and won't answer it.
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the A.A. success rate? What percentage of the newcomers are sober a year later?
Ten years later?
</font>
</font>

<p>
Sitting in a meeting doesn't guarantee you any recovery any more than
half-assing one of your secular solutions would produce good results.
It is only fair to ask the success rate among people who ACTUALLY WORK
the 12 steps and follow the program and that is something that none of
your studies address. Anyone is capable of doing this but it's not a
quick and easy fix.  I think it's hardly fair to evaluate the success
of AA based upon everyone who enters a room. AA isn't entering a room,
it's doing the steps and following the guidance as it's written.

<p>
<font color="blue">
In other words, the Steps don't work.<br>
A.A. doesn't work.<br>
People have to do all of the work themselves,
and quit drinking for themselves,
and then give undue credit to the 12 Steps or to Bill Wilson or to the A.A. cult or something...
</font>
<p>

Measure the the success rate of 3,4 or 5,000 people who've done THAT
and see what you come up with.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, so do it. You are in A.A.. You have better access to the A.A. headquarters
and the Triennial Surveys than I do. So set up the tests, and do them.
<p>
If A.A. was really so good, then why does the A.A. headquarters stubbornly refuse
to do any valid tests that will prove what the real A.A. success rate is?
Why do they in fact go out of their way to hide the numbers?
</font>
<p>

I'm sure the success rate of people who buy exercise machines off an
informercial is about the same as people who go into AA rooms---
because 98% of them use the exercise machine as a clothes rack and
never work out on it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are proving my points for me. A.A. is worthless. People have to do
all of the work themselves, or else A.A. doesn't work.
<p>
Given your conditions,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#patty_cake" target="_blank">the Patty-Cake Treatment Program</a>
will be just as successful as Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

Same goes for diets. They don't work if you don't follow directions
and stick to them.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Right. Again, you are proving my points for me. All you have to do is follow the
instructions of any quit-drinking program, and the program will work.
<p>
And Instruction One is:<br>
<font color="#9F0000" size="+2">
<b>1. Just don't drink any more alcohol.</b>
</font>
<p>
Just follow that one simple instruction, and the program will be a big success.
<p>
But what is the program really worth?<br>
Does the program actually cause anyone to quit drinking?<br>
There is no evidence to support such an assumption.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

[another letter from Ryan E.:]
<p>



Date:  	Wed, February 1, 2006<br>
From:  	&quot;Ryan E.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: A few questions<br>

<p>

Hmmm...

<p>

Interesting. I think am beginning to see where you are coming from. I
guess the one thing we agree on is that people have a hard time
conquering addiction. We also agree that it can be done without 12 step
programs. Personally, the advantage 12 step programs have for me are
that they are focused on helping you become a better person, not just
conquering addiction.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Ryan,
<p>
The 12-Step groups <i>*claim*</i> to be about making people better, but they
are really about guilt induction and other very harmful practices.
It's another
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch trick</a>.
</font>
<p>

I think if you are going to look at AA and NA purely from the standpoint
of the success rate across the board of every person who walks into a
few meetings (versus my standard of people who actually apply the
program) then it looks no more successful than anything else.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I'm sure that people can overcome addiction through sheer willpower and
identifying their &quot;addictive voice&quot; the only problem I see with that is
that there are other, underlying character issues like negative,
pessimistic thinking, jealous, anger towards strangers etc. etc. that
are common in addicted people and none of that is addressed by programs
like AVRT.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Just look to the news about James Frey if you want to see why this
matters. Here is this guy, the hero of recovery by rejecting 12 steps,
just toughing it out and &quot;holding on&quot; through willpower--- and what do
we come to find? The guy is a dishonest straight-out opportunistic LIAR.
If Frey had worked the steps instead of recoiling from them in fear
maybe he would have learned the value of honesty and not written &quot;A
Million Little Lies&quot; and duped millions of people out of their money.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Bill Wilson &quot;worked the Steps&quot; and he was a book-publishing money-stealing compulsive
liar all of his life. In fact, there are a lot of similarities between what James
Frey did and what Bill Wilson did.

</font>
<p>

Don't bother going on and on about how Bill W. was a liar here. I
beleive you. Most addicts are liars. That's the point of the program.
Bill W. is not held up as an example for us all to follow, he never was,
so attacking his character doesn't strengthen your argument.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Like hell is Bill not held up as an example.
<a href="orange-letters34.html#messenger" target="_blank">I regularly get letters</a>
that even deify him and declare that he was a Messenger from God.
</font>

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
You seem to bristle at the notion that anyone has any of these so-called
character defects or the idea that they might play a role in RELAPSE and
the addiction in the first place. I'm curious about that. It makes me
wonder if it's because some of that stuff hit too close to home for you.
You are clearly an angry guy. I think most people would take your entire
argument alot more seriously if it weren't so painfully obvious that you
have anger issues you have not yet worked out yourself. I actually find
myself feeling a little embarrassed for you reading some of your rants.
I'm not saying that to be condescending, I'm saying it because I can
relate to anger and I feel for you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is a neat example of the propaganda trick called &quot;ad hominem&quot;.
Rather than talk about the faults of Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-Step programs,
you want to turn it around and make it about me.
<p>
And once again, another Stepper parrots the standard A.A. lines about
&quot;angry&quot; and &quot;issues&quot; and &quot;resentments&quot;</a>.
<a href="orange-letters26.html#resentment" target="_blank">Look here</a>
for more of the same.
</font>
<p>

I can only tell you what my experience has been. I was a very negative,
pessimistic addicted person. I have been a pessimist and complainer for
as long as I can remember. I hated other people for what they had or
what they did. I felt sorry for myself often. Since I began actually
WORKING this program I've gone through what can only be described as a
miraculous change in attitude. That is a fact. I don't think for a
minute that I could have, through willpower alone, just &quot;changed&quot; my
entire outlook on life and attitude towards my fellow man. Beleive me I
have tried.  I'm not saying I'm perfect, but I have undergone more
positive change in less time than I ever have before at any point in my
life, including after years of psychotherapy, various anti-depressants
(I take none now and I feel happier than I have in decades)

<p>
<font color="blue">
And did you also quit drinking ethyl alcohol while going through those changes?
So what part of your recovery was caused by your no longer damaging your
brain with alcohol?
</font>
<p>

I'm not sure how you'd explain that or measure it as a determining
factor in you &quot;success rate&quot; but it is a very real thing to me
personally and I see the same thing happening for other people around me.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh come on. That is so simple that it is obvious. Out of each 1000 newcomers
to Alcoholics Anonymous, how many of them have 10 years of sobriety 10 years later?
You know what the answer is. You have eyes that can see. You know how few
people become old-timers.
</font>
<p>

I don't see how AVRT or any of the other programs and ideas that focus
on addiction ALONE, rather than as symptomatic behavior of a spiritually
unfit person would address any of that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you don't see. Please define &quot;spiritually unfit&quot;.
</font>
<p>

Ultimately, YES, you do have to do the work. That is whole point of AA
and NA. It is hard. Not everyone makes it. Most things worth having you
do have to work for. Do you really expect a quick-fix for something as
complex as addiction?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, the so-called &quot;work&quot; involved a lot of psychological damage,
things like "<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">Create a sense
of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>&quot;
That is not a fix at all, quick or slow.

</font>
<p>

I think you are far too focused on your empirical evidence to see that
it is barely relevant. You yourself admit that these studies are done
based on people who attend meetings. Not people who have worked the
steps and attend regularly and have a sponsor. Therefore you are judging
the efficacy of attending a few AA meetings---- NOT of the AA program.
The AA program is not &quot;go to a couple of meetings, get pissed off and go
home and relapse&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, you are mis-characterizing the tests of Alcoholics Anonymous that have been done.
Plus, you are trying to dismiss the results through the use of qualifiers &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The only people who count are the ones who 'worked a strong program'.&quot;
</font>
That is the same thing as saying that you will only count the success stories.
</font>
<p>

The AA PROGRAM is working the 12 steps, attending meetings AND having a
sponsor. Measure the &quot;success rate&quot; of people who WORK THE ACTUAL
PROGRAM, then your statistics actually become relevant.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, what is really important is that you do not put any more alcohol in your mouth
and swallow it. That is the real measure of success in any sobriety program.
The cult busy-work is just so much nonsense.

</font>
<p>

I'm not sure if I am not getting that very important point across
clearly enough or if you are just refusing to address it.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

YOUR STUDIES MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PEOPLE WHO WALK INTO A
MEETING, NOT PEOPLE WHO WORK THE PROGRAM.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are merely trying to ignore all of the A.A. failures by using qualifiers.
Like Bill Wilson said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They didn't really try. They didn't keep coming back.
They weren't constitutionally capable of being honest with themselves.&quot;
</font>
<p>
What you do not understand is that there are no excuses.
<p>
Either the program works and makes people quit drinking, or it is a failure.
<p>
I don't care how much you yammer about other stuff, like spirituality or personality
changes, the A.A. program is still a failure.
</font>
<p>

That's like measuring the weight loss of people who join a gym, and then
saying exercise is an ineffective tool for weight loss. You don't
measure the membership roster--- you measure the people who go in and
work out everyday!!!!  Is any of this registering?  The kernel of your
entire argument is flawed. If you are so well-versed in the art of
debate you should be able to see that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuses. Either the program achieves the desired end, or it is a failure.
Find another program that does the job.
</font>
<p>

As for the Nazism and the rest. Henry Ford was an anti-semite and a
Hitler fan. Do you think that means people shouldn't buy Ford Explorers
now? It's irrelevant to a person who wants recovery. AA principles were
not based on Nazi philosophies. Should people reject AA because Bill W.
was far from perfect and because of Buchman? No. The principles behind
AA are much older than Buchman or Bill W. They are basic rules to live
by that have roots in all of the worlds major religions. Bil W. is no
saint or hero. He simply compiled existing philosophies and ideas into a
format targeted at alcoholics. Period. If you're arguing with the ideas
themselves, you're arguing against the basic philosophies of most of the
worlds religions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is more minimization and denial. There are no &quot;spiritual principles&quot; in Frank Buchman's
cult practices that Bill Wilson rewrote as the 12 Steps.
Bill didn't &quot;compile&quot; any philosophies. He just took Buchmanism, the whole thing,
lock, stock, and barrel, when he stole the alcoholic branch of the Oxford Group and made
it his own cult.
Bill Wilson even said so:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,NewCentury Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of self-examination,
acknowledgement of character defects, restitution for
harm done, and working with others straight from the
Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.
</blockquote>

</font>
<p>

In my opinion you have allowed your hatred of AA to cloud your judgement
here. You would probably say I am brainwashed and so enamored of AA that
I can't see it's a secret Nazi fascist cult.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, A.A. is a cult that has 
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">a spiritual grandfather who was a Nazi sympathizer</a>.
</font>
<p>


The reason I doubt that is
that I am a natural skeptic and rejected AA for years. Being an agnostic
hateful bastard didn't get me very far in life and made me feel pretty
empty inside. I finally decided to allow for &quot;God&quot; and apply some
old-fashioned principles in my life and for the first time ever the
things I was promised by psychiatry and drugs (legal and illegal) have
began to come true in a very real and indisputable way. What can I say?
Am I deluded because you say I am? All I know is I am beginning to  feel
happy and satisfied with my life and the world in a way I never have
been in my adult life. Maybe we will never see eye-to-eye. I can only go
by what I am experiencing and what I see happening to the others around
me who ACTUALLY WORK THE PROGRAM.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So you finally surrendered your mind to the cult and now you are very happy,
except when somebody tells the truth about the history of the cult, at which
point you become very unhappy.

<p>
Speaking of people who actually work the program, what is the A.A. suicide rate?
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">I get a lot of reports</a>
that the program depresses some people so much that they commit
suicide.
</font>
<p>

Thanks for taking the time to respond. I hope that you are able to see
the most important point I made here and focus on that in your reply.

Subject: AOL Censorship (I thought this was the USA)<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange.
<p>
I came across your website about 2 weeks ago and cannot let go as I have found the
AA to be very troubling. Your problem with AOL was an impetuous to my cancelling my
subscription. I sent the following to the postmaster:

<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;This is to inform you that I am in the process of cancelling my aol account that I
had for many years. This is due to that fact that you had censored a website or
letters dealing with an individual that was providing information regarding the cult
of AA. I find that your tactics are appalling and hope that someone will sue you as
a result of not receiving the proper information from this individual and possibly
causing harm or even death.&quot; &#8212; Besides I am tired of the high rates and having to
speak to 1-800-NEW-DELHI whenever something goes wrong!!&quot;
</blockquote>

Your segment of the AA and Heresy is currently under review by my pastor (and good
friend) Father Bob.  Unfortunately, due to some legal circumstances, I need to be
involved with these folks for a bit, but at least I will fly under the radar screen.
I had a sponsor who wanted me to read aloud pages 84-87 everyday, this guy is
history now, I am biding my time and checking out SMART. When I get some time, I
will lay some of my philosophy, &quot;Strength, Hope and Experience&quot;, ha!.
<p>
Take care and enjoy your stuff<br>

Rob

From:  	&quot;Jo H.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Alcoholic Anonymous as a Cult<br>

<p>
I have just read your critical analysis of the 12-steps.  I found it
reassuring and inspiring at a time when I was feeling very alone with my
concerns and wondering whether I was simply being critical because I
fear losing the person I fell deeply in love with.

<p>
He is a business analyst by profession, logical and critical.  He was
also a committed atheist.
<a name="horrified"> </a>
<p>
Yes, he has an alcohol addiction.  Yes, he was in danger of losing his
job, home and relationship.  However, after only a half dozen or so AA
meetings he began spouting crap i.e. the slogans, the higher power,  and
instinctively I began to feel that the whole AA thing was very creepy.

<p>
During a visit he gave me a copy of the 12-steps and having read it
I was horrified.

<p>
He has left detox today.  He is expected to attend meetings every day
for the first 90 days after leaving and then at least 3 times a week.  I
have not voiced any of my criticisms of AA to him yet, as I feel its too
early in his recovery, and quite honestly I haven't decided the best way
to go about it.  I am also hoping that back in the real world he will
regain his full critical faculties.

<p>
Thanks so much

<p>
Jo H.

<font color="blue">
Hi Jo,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments and thanks.
I'm sorry to hear about your suffering, and your husband's problems.
I also hope he regains his faculties.
<p>
But understand that the purpose of the &quot;90 in 90&quot; routine is to quickly brainwash
him and convert him into a life-long member of the cult.
They don't want to give him time to regain his full critical faculties.
<p>
I don't know if you should wait to try talking sense to him. You fear that he
will relapse and return to drinking if you talk honestly with him, and coax
him away from the cult? That is exactly what A.A. teaches &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">phobia induction</a>.
They make people afraid to leave, and afraid to challenge the
cult, because it will make people relapse and die, they say.
<p>
But that isn't true at all. Cult religion does not keep people from drinking,
and the truth doesn't make people relapse.
A.A. has actually been shown to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">drive people to drink</a>.

<p>
A.A. just causes so much suffering, while the true believers brag about
how many people A.A. has &quot;helped&quot;. I don't know what it will take to put
a stop to that racket. But I would like to find out.
<p>
<a name="Hassan1"> </a>
The first thing I would try is
<a href="orange-jokes.html" target="_blank">the jokes</a>.
Anybody whose mind isn't totally gone can enjoy a good laugh. But cult religion has a
very hard time dealing with having its balloon punctured. The Papa Doc Ngobo
joke and the TV repairman joke strike me as being particularly appropriate.
At the end of the jokes file, you will find links to already-formatted pages
of jokes, ready to print.
<p>
I'll bet he is also intelligent enough to appreciate the
&quot;<a href="orange-thinker.html" target="_blank">Do You Think Too Much?</a>&quot;
joke.
<p>
And I don't think it's any too early for you to read Steve Hassan's book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="_blank"><i>Releasing the Bonds:
Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>.
It contains a wealth of practical advice on how to get through to somebody
whose thinking has been taken over by a cult.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Richard,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
Alas, there aren't any solid numbers, that I know of, about Bill's affairs
or sexual conquests. We have a lot of documentation that says there was a lot of it
going on, but we don't get exact counts of notches in bedposts.
<p>
We have Tom Powers, the co-author of Bill's second book,
<i>&quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;</i>,
who said that,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;This sex thing ran through the whole business. It wasn't just an
episode.&quot;
</font>

<p>
And we have the early A.A. members forming a &quot;Founder's Watch Committee&quot;, to
follow Bill Wilson around and keep him from seducing the pretty girls who
came to A.A. meetings.
<p>
But no exact numbers.
<p>
If you haven't already read it, do go read the web page

<p>
To Whom It May Concern,

<p>
I'm indeed very surprised and concerned to hear that it is not possible in
AOL to discuss freely a critical point of view about the activities of
Alcoholics Anonymous and to support other approaches on addiction
treatment. I cannot understand that you follow complaints of Your audience
so blindly obviously without checking neither content nor circumstances.
<p>
As a result I will ask my friends, family and business partners not to
further use AOL services as long as you have not managed to treat this
subject in an adequate manner.
<p>
As You might imagine we are a little bit concerned over here, that in a
country that helped us to develop our own democracy and helped so much in
supporting us to get rid of totalitarism, such practices of thought
control seem to be more and more common.

Subject:  	You got my attention<br>

<p>
Lets just say, hypothetically speaking, I am an alcoholic doing the
90-day AA thing because I want to.  Lets further say that I have now
been attending EVERY DAY for 4 weeks.  All of a sudden, when I'm
supposed to start my &quot;personal inventory&quot; (the Fourth Step) alas! a
funny (bad) feeling creeps up and makes me sick (as in spiritually,
emotionally, mentally, or whatever sick).  All of a sudden my heart
beats differently.  Alas! I just don't believe.  I don't believe in the
First Step &#8212; the &quot;Powerless&quot; thing.

<p>
I am a 46-year old attorney, who sometimes drinks too much and gets in
minor trouble.  My wife told me to quit, and I think it's time for a
change.  But I certainly did not become what I am (a damned good
criminal defense attorney) by being &quot;powerless&quot; and having an
&quot;unmanageable life&quot;.

<p>
So I Googled the phrase &quot;powerless alcohol&quot; and your site came up &#8212; at
the top.  I read a lot of your stuff.  You really put a lot of work into
your research, and it shows.  Thanks for shedding light on the subject.
I like your stuff.

<p>
Tell me more!  And by the way, you have my support to fight censorship.

<p>
Wow you did a lot a work and research. I've been in AA, did the steps four
times, and the fourth step with the Nazi types covering everything, and I've
found its flaws too.
<p>
I'm 35 years old and I don't really trust too much of
what old men did years ago in any thing. Any how I didn't read
everything you've written.
Maybe you'll agree with me that there are 1 or
2 good things in the book.<br>
1 is being driven by fears; it's an emotion a
core emotion as is love, which is only mentioned once in the book.
If there was ever a word that has more power than love then I'm unaware of
it. I think Bill and Bob were too.<br>
	The mentioning of fear though and if
one adds science to the equation is that not only are AAs but everyone
has fear and it makes unhealthy decisions for us. (Man i wish i took the
chance and asked her out.) Said this one enough myself; I never asked
because I was afraid.
<p>
I can only imagine some of the letters you've gotten both
good and bad.  I would like to see you pick apart Christianity; there's a
cult for ya.
<p>
The other good thing I see is that men actually talk to one
another about feelings.
Where i grew up in New York if you tried to do
this with the wrong person you were either labled Fag or you got a
beaten constantly. So I can see where you're coming from.
<p>
I no longer go to AA after 4 years, but I've met people who I can share my feelings with
and I don't have to pay a therapist.

<p>
If you were to write a book about how certain religion is about control
(well, you might be shot) but with proper marketing you could have a best
seller.
I've been researching a little how people are sick of being told
that Jesus loves you and the only way to heaven is......

From:  	&quot;R.T.B.&quot; 
Subject:  	the AOL thing<br>

<p>
Yo,
<p>
Yahoo not allowing a webpage on they're servers because they've gotten
complaints is one thing. It's their server; they can censor anything
they want. AOL not allowing anyone to use their email service to email
you (or you them) is quite another. This may be a real freedom of speech
issue and you should consult a lawyer. I would also go to other webpages
that people would find offensive ( like ogrish.com or rotten.com and
notmypope.com or porn sites or anything you can think of ) and email
them through AOL's email service to see what happens, (and tell them of
your situation) and catalogue it. This sounds like a serious deal, you
should have the right to recieve email from whoever through any service
no matter how &quot;offensive&quot; the page may be, and that's it! To put it
bluntly &#8212; This is bullshit!

<p>
I'll be honest, I got real problems with your page, but as far as
offensive, there are way more worse pages out there in terms of sex and
violence and opinions. Do they get censored at all? I did a search of
Yahoo geocites ( their FREE hosting service ) and first typed in
Satan, here are the results:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160313215743/http://us.geocities.yahoo.com/search?p=satan" target="_blank">
http://us.geocities.yahoo.com/search?p=satan</a>

<p>
I then typed in &quot;anti christian&quot; and got these results:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160313215743/http://us.geocities.yahoo.com/search?p=anti+christian" target="_blank">
http://us.geocities.yahoo.com/search?p=anti+christian</a>

<p>
I tried the same thing for AOL homepages and didn't come up with anything
(from the terms I used ) that anyone would find offensive (in my opinion).
Apparently they have a more stringent &quot;community standards&quot; clause
which they adhere to (which is their right as I said before).

<p>
But these are their FREE web hosting service mind you. I got a hunch
if you looked at sites people paid yahoo or AOL webhosting for you'd
find some pretty nasty stuff.

<p>
Since the real problem revolves around email, the above in and of
itself isn't that big a deal. I've got no problem with a hosting service
that protects kids ( I assume ) from stuff they shouldn't be seeing and
even stuff adults may not want to see. The question is: Does orange
papers really qualify as such?

<p>
The email situation by itself is intolerable and with the stuff
mentioned above, looking at it in it's proper context, YOU GOT A REAL
PROBLEM.

<p>
TALK TO A LAWYER.

<p>
Rob

<p>
P.S. I never complained about any site I've seen except one that looked
like it was peddling kids for sex, a pedophile site. I think it's safe
to assume that's offensive.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Rob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the support.
<p>
Like you said,
any ISP can block obnoxious web sites, like the vicious white supremicists
and the child pornographers. But blocking email that comes from a specific
person because somebody else doesn't like his web site is a whole different issue.
I wonder if that might even be a violation of the laws that protect email.
Email doesn't have as much protection as USPS mail, but it has some, due to
a law that Congress passed a few years back. But as I recall, there was a
specific loophole that allowed ISPs to block spam.

<p>
But alas, lawyers cost a lot of money. I wonder if the ACLU will be interested.
Did you know that AOL even kicked the ACLU off of the AOL message boards?
'Too controversial.'
I have been investigating, and it turns out that AOL has a very long history
of very heavy-handed arbitrary censorship.
<p>
Just to clarify a point &#8212; I can <i>receive</i> letters from AOL members; I just
can't answer them. And apparently, AOL customers can still see my web site, and
they can email me in response to what they read. And they do.
I just can't talk back to them in email.
(I wonder what AOL Instant Messenger would do...)

<p>
The whole issue of &quot;who complained?&quot; is interesting. In AOL's case,
&quot;numerous complaints&quot; about the web site means that 3 unnamed people complained that
they didn't like it. (Well, that's guaranteed. It isn't hard to find 3
true believers in a single big A.A. meeting.)

<p>
Then there is the question of what they are complaining about. If AOL objects
to the presence of 4-letter words, then that is especially funny, because
most of the 4-letter words on my web site come in the hate mail from the Steppers.
That could have been their strategy &#8212; they send vulgar and obscene hate mail, and then,
when I dutifully print their letters on my web site without censoring them, they go and
cry to AOL that they are offended by the foul language that they found on my web site.

<p>
Could be.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear Sirs

<p>
I write to protest your denial of email service to the owner of the
'Orange Papers' website on the wholy spurious grounds that people have
complained about it. I dare say they have, and that is their privilege
in a free society and a democracy of the sort which your country's
administration claims to want to see established throughout the globe.

<p>
Writing as a British subject, I ask you to reconsider this decision. I
can testify from personal experience that the Orange Papers website and
its owner perform a valuable service in provifinhg information that many
would like to see hidden. May they be enabled to continue to do so.

<p>

Subject:  	question<br>

<p>
Hi, My name is Stefan.  I was reading some of your
letters and material online concerning the program of
Alcoholics Anonymous.  I was curious why you are
saying AA doesn't work.  And I was also wondering what
alternatives you suggest to the alcoholic and/or
Addict.

<p>
Thank You

<p>
Stefan

Hi Stefan,
<p>
Thanks for the questions. The reason that I say that it doesn't work
is because it doesn't work. (Pardon the short, flippant answer, but
that is the simplest way to say it.) A.A. has been tested and
examined a lot, and the results were that:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness</a>,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">made alcoholics require more expensive hospitalizations later
on</a>, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. increased the death rate of alcoholics</a>,
and
<li> caused all kinds of other problems. Read the whole file
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</a>&quot;
<li>
<a name="suicide_list"> </a>
I believe that a good case can even be made that Alcoholics Anonymous also increases the
suicide rate of its members. Read
