<blockquote>
<b>It's all a big bait-and-switch con game.</b>
There are so many bait-and-switch stunts pulled in Alcoholics
Anonymous that it borders on amazing:
</blockquote>
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> <a href="#shifting_objectives">Shifting objectives:
First the goal is to quit drinking, and then the goal is to
&quot;acquire faith&quot; and &quot;come to believe&quot;
in Bill Wilson's religion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#spirit_rel">First, A.A. is just a nice
neighborhood quit-drinking self-help group, and then it's a
hard-core religion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#real_purpose">First, it's only a &quot;spiritual&quot;
alcoholism recovery program, and then it's a fundamentalist religion
whose 'real purpose' is to make you 'serve God'.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#better_religion">First,  Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religion,
but then it is better than all of the other religions.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#the_only_way">First, Bill Wilson declared that Alcoholics
Anonymous was only one of many ways to achieve sobriety, then he declared
that it was <i>The Only Way</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#real_alcoholic">First, A.A. members insist that Alcoholics
Anonymous does not claim to be the only way, then they
insist that any alcoholic who quits drinking without A.A. was not a <i>real alcoholic</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#suggested">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#doctors">First, they will tell you to see a doctor, and say
that &quot;we know only a little&quot;, but then it's &quot;We know more than doctors&quot;,
&quot;We are the experts on addictions&quot;, and &quot;Don't take medications.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="#your_way">First, they will tell you that you can do it your way.
Then they will tell you that you must do it their way.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#take_what2">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#take_what">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you can't ever leave.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#charming">First, alcoholics are charming, and then they are disgusting.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#God_loves_you">First, God loves you, and then He doesn't.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#unconditionally">First, God loves you unconditionally,
and then God won't save you unless you 'work a strong program'.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#your_servant">First, God is your servant, and then you are a slave of God.</a>
<p><li> <a href="#be_perfect">First, you don't have to be perfect, and then you do.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#honesty">First, they tell you that Alcoholics Anonymous
is a program of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, and then it's gross dishonesty:
<i>&quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Act As If&quot;</i>
and <i>&quot;Don't tell the newcomers...&quot;</i></a>

<p><li> <a href="#promotion">First, it's just a quiet, confidential program
of attraction, then it's a tough-love program of steel-fisted coercion
and promotion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#death_threats">First, you get declarations of easy-going tolerance, and then,
death threats.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#your_responsibility">First, A.A. tells you that you are
responsible for your own sobriety &#8212; that you must do all of the work &#8212;
but then, if you succeed, A.A. claims that it was responsible for your success.</a>

<p><li>  <a href="#not_our_fault">First, the story is &quot;The A.A. program
works great&quot;, but then, when people relapse, &quot;It isn't our fault&quot;.</a>

<p><li>  <a href="#steps_cause">First, A.A. promoters claim that the 12-Step program causes
A.A. members to do good things, but when A.A. members do bad things, they claim that the
Steps had nothing to do with it.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#disease">First they tell you that you have a &quot;disease&quot;, and you
are powerless over alcohol, but then you must </i>choose</i> sobriety and &quot;work a
strong program&quot; and keep yourself sober.

<p><li> <a href="#powerless">First they tell you that you are <b><i>powerless</i></b> over alcohol, but if you drink
any alcohol, then it's your fault because you <b><i>chose</i></b> to drink.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#self_reliance">First they tell you that self-reliance is bad, and then sobriety is your own responsibility.</a>


<p><li> <a href="#discuss_numbers">First, they talk about numbers, and then
they refuse to discuss numbers.
Likewise, first they claim a great success rate, and then they refuse
to discuss the success rate.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#a_cure">First, a cure, and then, no cure.
First, hope of recovery, and then hopelessness.</a>


<p><li> <a href="#make_you_quit">
First it works, and then it doesn't.
First, the story is that the
Twelve Steps will work and make you quit drinking, and then they won't.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#success">
First, A.A. is a great success and always has been, and then A.A. isn't a success, and never was.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#redefine_words">Redefine Words: First a word means
one thing, and then it means something else.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#Step2">First, the insanity referred to in Step Two means
that you have been insanely drinking enough alcohol to kill you,
but then &quot;insanity&quot; means that you have not been living
according to God's will.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#dictatorship">First, Alcoholics Anonymous
is a community of equals, just a nice neighborhood self-help group,
and then it's a hierarchical dictatorship with Bill Wilson at the top.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#adult_child">First, you are an adult, and then you are
a child.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#our_brothers">First, the alcoholics who are still
drinking are our brothers, our &quot;fellow travelers&quot; &#8212; people who should be granted sympathy,
understanding, unconditional love, and complete acceptance &#8212; and then
the alcoholics who won't conform to the A.A. program are just worthless
bums.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#medical_moral">The medical-to-moral morph: First, alcoholism is a disease to be cured,
and then it is a sin that must be removed by God.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#not_treatment">First, A.A. is good treatment for the
&quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;, and then it isn't treatment at all.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#family">First, A.A. is a quit-drinking program for
the alcoholics, and then it's a religion for the whole family.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#scientific">First, A.A. is very scientific and is psychologically sound,
and then it isn't based on science at all.

<p><li> <a href="#psychological_moral">The psychological-to-moral morph.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#your_fault">First it isn't your fault that you were born an alcoholic, and then it is.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#not_guilty">First you aren't supposed to feel guilty, and then you are.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#stigma">First they will tell you that alcoholism is not
a moral stigma, and then they will tell you that it is.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#increase_stigma">First they say that they want to reduce the stigma of alcoholism, and then they work to increase it.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#alcoholic">First they will tell you that an alcoholic is
just a good person who can't control his drinking, but later they will
tell you that an alcoholic is a disgusting immoral selfish evil creature who
has a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#no_musts">First they tell you that
&quot;There are no <i>'Musts'</i> in Alcoholics Anonymous, only suggestions&quot;,
but then they will tell you that there are
many necessities and <i>musts</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#problem">First, they tell you that &quot;You must admit that you
have a problem&quot;, but then that gets changed into &quot;You must admit that
you are powerless and you have a disease from which you can never recover.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="#political">First it isn't political, and then it is.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#Calvinist">First, Bill Wilson declared that the A.A. religious
dogma was just the perennial Christian philosophy, &quot;common to all denominations&quot;,
but then it isn't Christian at all. It's a strange kind of Calvinist social
Darwinism that believes in pre-destination. 

<p><li> <a href="#speak">First, no one is entitled to speak for A.A., but
then some special privileged people <i>are entitled</i> to speak for A.A.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#progressive_terminology">Progressive Terminology:
First, they tell you to do an honest, complete, &quot;moral inventory&quot;,
and then they tell you to only talk about your &quot;wrongs&quot; and
&quot;character defects&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#egomania_humility">First, ego-mania, and then abject humility.
First, happiness, and then sadness.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#ego_destruction">First, ego-destruction, and then
bombastic delusions of grandeur.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#spir_experience">First, expect a great religious or
spiritual experience, and then expect nothing.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#unconditional_love">First, &quot;unconditional love&quot;
and then hateful contempt.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#dont_think">First, A.A. tells you to
<i>&quot;Think, Think, Think&quot;</i>, but later it's <i>&quot;Stop Your
Stinkin' Thinkin'.&quot;</i></a>

<p><li> <a href="#believe_everything">First, A.A. tells you that
&quot;A.A. requires no beliefs,&quot; but then you have to believe
everything they tell you, and have blind faith in the proclamations
of Bill Wilson.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#anyGod">First, prospective new members are offered a
tolerant, open-minded &quot;spiritual&quot; program, but then they get
narrow-minded demands for belief in Bill Wilson's teachings.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#literal">Flip-flop: Literal versus vague interpretation</a>

<p><li> <a href="#real_AA">
First, the real A.A. is one thing, and then it is something else.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#Bill_W">
First,
<i>&quot;Bill Wilson was the heroic Founder of A.A., a genius who invented a new
way to achieve sobriety, a saint who brought a new revelation from God,
and the author of the sacred <i>Big Book</i>&quot;</i>,<br>
but then, when people learn what an insane lying philandering thieving creep he was,
the rap changes into
<i> &quot;Bill Wilson has nothing to do with A.A. We don't pay any attention
to what he said.&quot;</i></a>


<p><li> <a href="#keep_your_religion">First, you can keep your own religion,
and then you can't.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#Christian">First, A.A. is completely compatible with Christianity,
then it isn't.

<p><li> <a href="#surrender2God">First it's &quot;Surrender to God&quot;
and then it's &quot;surrender to some A.A. members&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#re_education">First, it's <i>&quot;any God as you
understand Him&quot;</i>, and then it's <i>&quot;You don't understand
God. You are 'confused' and 'prejudiced'.&quot;</i></a>

<p><li> <a href="#any_religious">First, declarations of Religious Freedom,
and then demands for Religious Conformity.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#power_greater">First, a loosely-defined &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
and then an explicitly-defined &quot;God&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#kind_of_God">Redefine God. First you get one God,
then you get a different God.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#teaspoons">Hide from newcomers what membership entails.
First show them one image, then show them another image.</a>

<p><li> <a href="#treatment_program">Offer them medical treatment for alcoholism, but
give them the twelve-step religion.</a>

</ol>

<p>
<a name="shifting_objectives"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
Shifting objectives: First the goal is to quit drinking, and then
the goal is to &quot;acquire faith&quot; and &quot;come to believe&quot;
in Bill Wilson's religion &#8212;
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Buchmanism</a>.<br>
</font>
Likewise, first the goal of the A.A. program is supposed to be
to save the alcoholics from death by alcoholism,
and then the goal is to induce &quot;spiritual experiences&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#magical2" target="_blank">gut- or heart-felt experiences</a>&quot;.<br>
And again, first the goal of the A.A. program is supposed to be
to quit drinking, and then it is to &quot;make spiritual progress&quot;
by practicing the Twelve Steps and confessing all of your &quot;moral
shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character&quot;.


<p>
Watch how the goal changes through this paragraph of instructions
to the wives of alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There is another paralyzing fear. You <font color="#9F0000">may</font> be afraid your husband
will lose his position; you are thinking of the disgrace and hard
times which will befall you and the children.
This experience <font color="#9F0000">may</font> come to you.
Or you <font color="#9F0000">may</font> already have had it
several times. Should it happen again, regard it in a different
light.
<font color="#9F0000">Maybe</font> it will prove a blessing!
It <font color="#9F0000">may</font> convince your husband
he wants to stop drinking forever. And now you know that he can
stop if he will! Time after time, this apparent calamity has been
a boon to us, for it opened up a path which led to the discovery
of God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>To Wives</i>, page 116.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Bill Wilson started off talking about how bad it will be if the husband
loses his job.
<li>
Then Wilson rationalized that such a calamity
<font color="#9F0000"><i>might</i></font> provide
the impetus for the husband to quit drinking.
(That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>Sly Suggestions</i></a>.)
<li>
Then Bill suddenly jumped to the completely illogical conclusion that<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;And now you know that he can stop if he will!&quot;</font><br>
There is no logic to that statement.
Nothing that Bill said before supports that conclusion.
That is an example of the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#irrelevant_conclusion" target="_blank">
<i>&quot;Irrelevant Conclusion&quot;</i></a>. And it's also an example of
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers">Lying With Qualifiers</a>&quot;</i>
&#8212; he can stop <b>&quot;if he will&quot;</b>.
Anybody can stop &quot;if he will&quot;, and he can't stop &quot;if he won't.&quot;

<li>
Then Bill switched to babbling about how wonderful it was for many such
husbands to get forced into a religious group &quot;which led to the
discovery of God.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
Is the goal to quit drinking and save the job, home and family, or is
the goal to start believing in Bill Wilson's religion?
Obviously, as far as Bill Wilson was concerned, the real goal was to
get more members for his Buchmanite cult religion.
Bill even said so:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose is to fit
ourselves to be of maximum service to God</font>
and the people about us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>Into Action</i>, page 77.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<center>
<table width="91%" border="4" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20" bordercolor="#9F0000">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

And when Bill Wilson declared,<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;And now you know that he can stop if he will!&quot;</font>,<br>
Bill directly contradicted his previous statement in A.A. Step One:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol...&quot;<br>
</font>
People who can stop drinking <font color="#9F0000"><i>if they will</i></font>
are not powerless over alcohol. They have a choice in the matter.
They can drink, or not drink, as they choose.
<p>
Bill Wilson was telling one story to the alcoholic husbands &#8212; that they
were powerless over alcohol and that their lives were unmanageable, so
they couldn't ever quit A.A. or even graduate from the program &#8212; while
Bill told the wives just the opposite &#8212; that their husbands could quit
drinking if they really wanted to.

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p><br>
<a name="acquire_faith"> </a>
Again, Bill Wilson pretended to be open-minded when he declared in the
<i>Big Book</i> that A.A. was not <i>the only way</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have no desire to convince anyone that there is only one way
by which faith can be acquired. &nbsp; ...<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>There Is A Solution</i>,
page 28.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="acquire_faith"> </a>
But that is just another bait-and-switch stunt:<br>
<ol>
<li> First, Alcoholics Anonymous was advertised as a quit-drinking program,<br>
<li> but then Bill suddenly switched the goal, and declared that it was
an &quot;acquire faith&quot; program,
and the &quot;faith&quot; that you must acquire is belief in Bill Wilson's religion
&#8212; &quot;the discovery of God.&quot;
</ol>
<p>
Bill Wilson did it again here, while he also declared that you could use
your Alcoholic Anonymous group as your &quot;god&quot;
(G.O.D. = <b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>runks):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I must quickly assure you that A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest for faith.
You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your 'higher power.' Here's a very large group of
people who have solved their alcohol problem. In this respect they are certainly a power
greater than you, who have not even come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in
them. Even this minimum of faith will be enough. You will find many members who have crossed
the threshold just this way. All of them will tell you that, once across, their faith
broadened and deepened.
Relieved of the alcohol obsession, their lives unaccountably
transformed, they came to believe in a Higher Power, and most of them began to talk of
God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, pages 27-28.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Who says that A.A. members are on a &quot;quest for faith&quot;? It was supposed to be a quest for sobriety.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(By the way, there is nothing &quot;unaccountable&quot; about how a cult changes people's lives,
and messes with their minds, and changes their religious beliefs. It's
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">a well-understood process</a>.)
</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson did it again here, in the recruiting manual for Alcoholics Anonymous.
Bill taught the recruiters to handle the prospective new alcoholic members this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook
">
If he is sincerely interested and wants to see you again, ask him to read this
book in the interval. After doing that, he must decide for himself whether he wants
to go on. He should not be pushed or prodded by you, his wife, or his friends.
If he is to find God, the desire must come from within.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>,
page 95.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Find God?</i> The advertised goal, what the alcoholic's wife was
told to get the A.A. recruiter in the door of the alcoholic's house, was that
A.A. was a sobriety fellowship that would make the alcoholic quit drinking.
The wife of the alcoholic was supposed to introduce the recruiter to the
alcoholic husband this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You should be described to him as one of a fellowship who, as part of their own
recovery, try to help others and who will be glad to talk to him if he cares to
see you.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>,
page 90.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But then the goal changed to &quot;finding God&quot; and &quot;a quest for faith&quot;.
<p>
Likewise, the goal of Al-Anon is supposed to be to help family members of alcoholics cope with
life with an alcoholic (and to learn how to nudge him towards quitting drinking, and
to learn to stop enabling him to continue drinking).
Al-Anon advertises on the radio,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;We are the family and friends of alcoholics, and we
want our lives back.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
But an Al-Anon book of daily meditations tells us this story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When I first came to Al-Anon, I didn't care one way or the other about a Higher Power.
When I read the Steps with all those references to God, I was a little skeptical. I
wasn't even sure I wanted a relationship with a Higher Power or what to do with one if I
had it. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Gradually, by keeping an open mind and heart, attending meetings, and using the program tools,
I became willing to have, and then actually yearned for, a relationship with a Higher Power.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Hope for Today</i>, published by Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc., page 262.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
Proving once again that religious conversion is a big part of the 12-Step program.
The goal of Al-Anon is to convert the rest of the family into believers in Buchmanism.
</i></font>

<p>
<a name="spirit_rel"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b> First, A.A. is just a nice
neighborhood quit-drinking self-help group, and then it's a
hard-core religion.

<p>
Likewise, first the religion isn't very important, but then it is.
<p>
And first, you don't have to be religious if you don't want to, but then you do, if you want to live.

<p>
One of the reasons that &quot;the newcomer's face falls when we speak
of spiritual matters&quot; is that the newcomer realizes that Bill
and his gang are pulling a bait-and-switch stunt on him.
The beginner came to what they said was a quit-drinking
self-help group where they talk about alcoholism and quitting drinking,
just a bunch of nice people who get together
each week to help each other to stay sober.
Now this fundamentalist preacher named Bill W.
is lecturing everybody about God and true faith, and saying that you are
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudiced</a>&quot;</i>
and <i>&quot;not thinking honestly&quot;</i> if you disagree with him.

<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<b>(<i>&quot;Oops, I must be in the wrong meeting. I thought
they said this get-together was supposed to be about how to quit
drinking.&quot;</i>)</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
And notice how Bill Wilson sneered at the alcoholic who
wanted to talk about alcoholism, rather than get preached at:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...we have re-opened a subject
which our man thought he had neatly evaded or entirely ignored.&quot;<br>
</font>

Bill declared that you were being dishonest and trying to
&quot;evade or ignore&quot;
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#obvious_truth" target="_blank">the obvious
truth</a> (at least, obvious to him) if you disagreed with his dogmatic
religious statements and grandiose proclamations.


<p><br>
So what does any of this have to do with quitting drinking?
Well, Bill Wilson insisted that only by believing in his adopted cult religion
would you be able to quit drinking.
Bill believed that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">
<i><b>the only cure</b></i></a>
for alcoholism was to become
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung" target="_blank">a <i>religiomaniac</i></a>,
a religious maniac. Literally.
Carl Jung, the famous Swiss psychiatrist,
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland" target="_blank">had allegedly suggested to a rich American
alcoholic patient, Rowland Hazard</a>, that
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;the only radical remedy ... for dipsomania is religiomania&quot;</b></font>,
and Bill Wilson believed it.
That's the real Alcoholics Anonymous program &#8212; get religion, and pray that God will
make you quit drinking.

By the way, the story that Carl Jung insisted that alcoholics must become religiomaniacs
if they wish to live
is apocryphal. There is no truth to it. It's just another one of those A.A. legends that
is completey untrue.

<p>
<a name="CJung"> </a>
Bill Wilson believed that <i>&quot;the only radical remedy ... for
dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;</i> Meaning:
the only cure for alcoholism is religious fanaticism &#8212; religious mania.
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">That suggestion allegedly came from Carl Jung</a>,
the famous Swiss psychiatrist, and when Carl Jung said &quot;mania&quot;,
he really did mean &quot;mania&quot;, as in &quot;maniac&quot;.<br>
<p>
<a name="William_James"> </a>
Both William H. White, in <i>Slaying The Dragon</i>, page 77,
and Bill Pitmann, in <i>AA: The Way It Began</i>, page 171,
attribute that dipsomania quote to
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Varieties_quote">William James in
<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i></a>, (page 263), not to
Carl Jung. For good reason &#8212; footnote 1 on page 263
of <i>Varieties</i> says:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
'&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot;
is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical man.'</font>
<p>
William James published <i>Varieties</i> in 1902, but he didn't meet Carl Jung
until 1909, so it is unlikely that James got that line from Jung.
<p>
Furthermore, nowhere in the writings of Carl Jung is there anything like the statement that 
&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;
Quite the opposite.  
<a href="orange-Jung.html" target="_blank">
The one story in the collected works of Carl Jung</a>
that described him treating an alcoholic patient explained how Jung
cured the patient by separating him from his domineering mother.

</ul>

<p>
<a name="realpurp"> </a>
But, later, they will talk endlessly about &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
confessions, surrender to God, and religion. You will only gradually
find out that it is an intensely religious cult based on the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">strange teachings</a> of a
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler" target="_blank">Hitler-admiring</a> renegade

Daniel Buchman</a>, and the grandiose proclamations of
one of his
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">
mentally-ill</a> converts, William Griffith Wilson.

<p>
Then, in the Appendix to the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>,
Bill Wilson declared that the purpose of the A.A. program
was to induce religious experiences so intense that they would permanently
change the personality of an A.A. member:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terms &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and
&quot;spiritual awakening&quot; are used many times in this book
which, upon careful reading, shows that
<font color="#9F0000">the personality change sufficient to bring about
recovery from alcoholism</font> has manifested itself among us in many
different forms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the
impression that
<font color="#9F0000">these personality changes, or
religious experiences</font>,
must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals.
Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Most of our experiences are what the psychologist William James
<font color="blue">
[in his book <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>]</font>
calls
<font color="#9F0000">the &quot;educational variety&quot;</font>
because they develop slowly over a period of time.
<!----------------------
Quite often friends of the newcomer
are aware of the difference long before he is himself.
He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in
his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been
brought about by himself alone.
------>
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 569.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you can get a sudden, dramatic religious experience,
or a slow gradual religious experience,
but you must get one.

<p>
Bill Wilson declared that only by doing what God dictates, as he saw an
authoritarian patriarchal God dictating, will you be able to avoid death
by alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Follow the dictates of a Higher Power and you will presently
live in a new and wonderful world...&quot;<br>

<p>
<a name="vision_of_God"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily
reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition.

<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th editions,

<p>
And then, finally, Bill Wilson declared that the real purpose of his program
was to get people to &quot;seek and do God's will&quot; every day:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<center>
<table width="86%" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="3">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
But the only way that Bill wanted to &quot;be of service&quot; to other people
was to convert them to his A.A. religion.
He performed no other &quot;services&quot; for people, because:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
So don't help the alcoholics, and don't perform any services for them.
Bill says that
<a href="orange-rroot930.html#Tod_Sloan" target="_blank">they must learn to rely on God</a>.
<p>
You know, that is really heartless spiritual one-upmanship.
Buchmanism is such an evil religion. Tell a cold and hungry homeless person,
<i>&quot;I'm not going to give you any money or food or even a cup of coffee because
you must learn to rely on God.&quot;</i>
<p>
(What does that even mean? &quot;Rely on God&quot;? Does God hand out sandwiches
and cups of coffee to the homeless?)

Some Alcoholics Anonymous members are such extreme religious fundamentalists
that they want you on your knees, praying to God, at least once &#8212;
preferably twice &#8212; every day.

The AA member has to conform to the principles of recovery. His life
actually depends upon obedience to spiritual principles. If he deviates
too far, the penalty is sure and swift; he sickens and dies. At first
he goes along because he must, but later he discovers a way of life he
really wants to live. Moreover, he finds he cannot keep this priceless

<p>
Likewise, the A.A.
&quot;<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad1" target="_blank">First Tradition</a>&quot;, which Bill Wilson wrote,
says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
<blockquote>

These statements come from more A.A. promoters:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One way or another Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar Twelve-Step
program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries

put a recovering addict on the road to relapse.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Recovery Book</i>,
Al J. Mooney M.D., Arlene Eisenberg, and Howard Eisenberg, pages 40-41.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, <i>&quot;it is widely believed&quot;</i> that A.A. is essential to recovery?
Widely believed by whom?
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#passive_voice" target="_blank">using the passive voice</a>,
where things get done by some invisible unnamed people.
<p>
The authors are also using the propaganda trick of
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank">Everybody's Doing It,
and Everybody Knows</a></i>.
It's just like
<font color="#9F0000">&quot;Everybody knows that the world is flat.&quot;</font>
Well,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Everybody knows that A.A. works great.&quot;</font>
<p>
The A.A. and N.A. recruiters and promoters are, of course, totally ignoring the simple
fact that the 12-Step program
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">doesn't really work at all</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">it just raises the death rate</a>.
<p>
The statement that
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;One way or another Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar Twelve-Step
program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries from
alcohol or drug abuse&quot;</i></font> is nothing but a blatant lie.
Even a simple examination of the facts reveals that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">A.A. has an immense
drop-out rate</a> and that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the A.A. program
rarely works</a>,
and most of the successful people quit without A.A. or any 12-Step program.
<p>
The NIAAA's 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions
interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol dependence found
in the DSM-IV, they found:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from
alcohol dependence do so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty
alcohol (rehab) programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence
ever receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, the Harvard Medical School stated that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">80% of the alcoholics
who successfully quit drinking for a year or more do it <i><b>alone</b></i></a>,
without any &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.

Telling newcomers one thing, and then changing the story later,
is called &quot;deceptive recruiting&quot; and &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; selling.

<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, A.A. members insist that Alcoholics
Anonymous does not claim to be the only way, then they
insist that any alcoholic who quits drinking without A.A. was not a <i>real alcoholic</i>.
</font>
<p>
Again, first A.A. members quote Bill Wilson and insist that they do not say that A.A. is the only way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Upon therapy for the alcoholic himself, we surely have no monopoly.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
But then they insist that if someone leaves A.A. and successfully quits drinking on his own,
that he was not a <i>real alcoholic</i> at all &#8212;  the underlying belief being that no real
alcoholic can quit without A.A., because A.A. really is <i>the only way</i>
for a <i>real alcoholic</i> to quit drinking.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Further, many people who enter [A.A.] are not even alcoholic &#8212; they are
simply heavy drinkers experiencing unpleasant consequences.  An example is a
parent who drinks too much and makes a fool out of themselves at the PTA
meeting &#8212; then goes to AA for a couple months to atone for their blunder.
Another is the celebrity who crashes their car or ruins a movie because of
their substance abuse then attends meetings for a while.  These people can
then leave AA and refrain from drinking all by themselves, and they do this
with ease, because they were never really alcoholic in the first place...<br>

It's often said that the steps are &quot;suggested&quot; in
the same way as
when you jump out of an airplane wearing a parachute, it is
&quot;suggested&quot;
that you pull the ripcord.
This story from an A.A. book of daily meditations shows how
the meaning of the word &quot;suggested&quot; has been
twisted into <i>&quot;absolutely required&quot;</i>.
In this and other ways, the meaning of
the word &quot;suggested&quot; is perverted:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I remember my sponsor's answer when I told him that
the Steps were &quot;suggested.&quot; He replied
that they are &quot;suggested&quot; in the same way that, if you
jump out of an airplane with a parachute, it is
&quot;suggested&quot; that you pull the ripcord to save your
life. He pointed out that it was &quot;suggested&quot; I practice
the Twelve Steps, if I wanted to save my life.
So I try to remember daily that I have a whole program
of recovery based on all Twelve of the &quot;suggested&quot; Steps.<br>

<p>
Then, in the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson instructs the A.A. recruiters
to pressure prospective new members to write a blank check to A.A. &#8212;
to get them to agree in advance to do <i>absolutely anything</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
And then Bill Wilson declared that you do not even have

So you don't even have
<font color="#9F0000"><i>the right</i></font>

Bill Wilson even wrote that the Twelve Steps were written down in the
<i>Big Book</i> so that A.A. members couldn't &quot;wiggle out of the
deal&quot; and not do his Steps:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this

six-step program then.<br>
...<br>
The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of
concrete principles
that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out
of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps
which people wiggled out of.<br>

<p>
Finally, the real kicker was Bill Wilson declaring that
A.A. members who didn't &quot;work the Steps to the best of their ability&quot; were
&quot;<!-- a href="#death_warrant" -->signing their own death warrant<!-- /a -->&quot;.
There wasn't a hint of freedom left there.

<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b> First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.
</font>
<p>
Again, first you get a come-on that promises freedom. But later you will 
hear exhortations to work a strong program exactly as your sponsor tells you 
to do it, or exactly as described in the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
Some sponsors tell a story about how they tried to make some strawberry
shortcake by only taking the parts of the recipe that they liked, and
leaving the rest out. The result was terrible shortcake. So the moral
of the story is that you must follow the 12-Step recipe exactly as it
is given to you.
<p>
Another version of this story is:
Some oldtimer will sagely tell a story about trying to make a chocolate 
cake from his aunt's recipe, except that he decided to do it his own way and only use
some of the ingredients &#8212; and the result was a terrible cake.
The moral is that you must work <i>all</i> of the Steps, all of the time,
and do the <i>entire</i> A.A. program, just like how the oldtimers supposedly did.
(They didn't, really. Half of the original A.A. members totally rejected
Bill Wilson's cult religion practices, and never &quot;worked the Steps&quot;.)
<p>
Then another condescending sponsor will parrot the slogan,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's too early in your recovery for you to start being creative.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Likewise, the more dogmatic old-timers will declare that just taking what you want
produces &quot;watered-down A.A.&quot;, and they emphasize that you must
<i>thoroughly</i> follow &quot;our path&quot;.
And the slogan is,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">

<p><li>
<a name="Paul_Molloy"> </a>
In his own story of alcoholism and joining A.A., Paul Molloy gave us this
bombastic, grandiose lunacy, supposedly from a non-alcoholic who is envious
of those lucky alcoholics in A.A.:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;... there are times, oh so many times, when I wish I had been an alcoholic. The reason is
that I consider the AA people to be the most charming in the world. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I asked myself why I consider so charming these alcoholic caterpillars who have
found their butterfly wings in AA. I can name a few reasons. The AA people are what they
are, and they were what they were, because they are sensitive, imaginative,
possessed of a sense of humor and an awareness of universal truth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They are sensitive, which means they hurt easily, and that helped them become
alcoholics. But when they have found their restoration, they are still as sensitive
as ever &#8212; responsive to beauty and truth, and eager about the intangible
glories of this life. That makes them charming companions. And they are possessed
of a sense of universal truth that is often a new thing in their hearts. The
fact that this at-one feeling with God's universe had never been awakened in them
is sometimes the reason why they drank.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The fact that it was at last awakened is almost always the reason why
they were restored to the good and simple ways of life. Stand with them when
the meeting is over, and listen as they say the 'Our Father.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They have found a power greater than themselves which they serve diligently.
And that gives them a charm that never was elsewhere on land and sea. It makes you
know that God Himself is really charming, because the AA people reflect His
mercy and His forgiveness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;They are imaginative, and that helped to make them alcoholics. Some
of them drank to flog their imaginations on to greater things. Others
guzzled only to black out unendurable visions that rose in their imaginations.
But when they have found their restoration, their imagination is responsive
to new thinking, and their talk abounds with color and light. And that, too,
makes them charming companions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;They are possessed of a sense of humor. Even in their cups they have
been known to say damnably funny things. Often, it was being forced to take
seriously the little and mean things of life that made them seek escape in
the bottle. But when they have found their restoration, their sense of humor
finds a blessed freedom, and they are able to reach a god-like state, where
they can laugh at themselves &#8212; at the very height of self-conquest.<br>

</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Where Did Everybody Go?</i>, Paul Molloy, pages 187-189.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alcoholics reach a god-like state? Good grief.
</ul>


<p>
But then they pull the switch, and suddenly the alcoholics are all so bad that they seem to be the spawn of Satan:

that we could live by our own individual strength and intelligence, for just
that long was a working faith in a Higher Power impossible. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
That basic ingredient of all humility, a desire to seek and do God's will,
was missing.<br>

<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, God loves you unconditionally,
and then God won&quot;t save you unless you &quot;work a strong program&quot;.
</font>
<p>
One A.A. missionary tells us that:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I believe that in a hundred years historians will look back and
pinpoint this milestone as the single most important event in the
twentieth century. This milestone was the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous
in Akron, Ohio, in June of 1935.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides the invaluable gift of sobriety that AA has given to millions
of Alcoholics, it also started a revolution in Spiritual consciousness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The dramatic success and expansion of AA facilitated the spread of a
radically revolutionary idea which has traditionally, in Western Civilization,
been considered heresy. This was not a new idea but rather a reintroduction
and clarification of an old idea, coupled with a formula for practical
application of the concept into day-to-day human life experience.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This revolutionary idea was that an unconditionally Loving Higher Power
exists with whom the individual being can personally communicate.
A Higher Power that is so powerful that it has no need to judge the
humans it created because this Universal Force is powerful enough to
ensure that everything unfolds perfectly from a Cosmic Perspective.<br>

(I just have to ask, what happened to the Unconditional Love of Higher Power when
that tsunami hit Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia and killed hundreds of
thousands of people? And now they have been
clobbered by an earthquake, and next they are going to get wiped out by a volcano.
Unconditional Love? Does Higher Power only unconditionally love white people on this
side of the planet? Does Higher Power only care about alcoholics?)
<p>
Of course that also begs the theological question: Where was the unconditional love of God when he
let alcoholics drink themselves to death for 20 or 30 years?
And why didn't God care about the welfare of the children who suffered at the hands of the alcoholics?
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
But that grandiose flowery talk is followed by death threats if you don't conform
to the group and <i>Work The Steps</i> every day:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we have is a daily reprieve
contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day

<p>
And finally Bill Wilson told us that we are
<a href="#death_warrant">signing our own death warrants</a>
if we don't do his 12 Steps. God's &quot;unconditional love&quot; won't save us:
<p>
<blockquote>

Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our

inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to spiritual principles

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the

<font color="#4f007f">
<li> <i>&quot;Let Go And Let God&quot;</i>
<li> <i>&quot;Turn It Over&quot;</i> [to God]
</font>
</ul>

<p>
<li> In Step Seven, God will allegedly remove your many defects of character and moral
shortcomings, and make you into a superior spiritual being, just because you humbly beg Him to do so.
<p>
<li> But in Step Eleven it becomes obvious that you are to be a slave of God,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">having to conduct a s&eacute;ance and
get your work orders from God every day</a>,
and spend your whole life carrying out those orders:

conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
And here Bill reveals that you cannot have a life of your own; you are
first and foremost a slave of God:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The notion that we would still live our own lives, God helping
a little now and then, began to evaporate.
Many of us who had thought ourselves religious awoke to the limitations
of this attitude.
Refusing to place God first, we had deprived ourselves of His help.
But now the words &quot;Of myself
I am nothing, the Father doeth the works&quot;, began to carry
bright promise and meaning.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We saw that we needn't always be bludgeoned and beaten into humility.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<!-----
Then, Bill Wilson wrote that we cannot do what we wish in this life &#8212; we must
instead constantly do God's will.
----------------->

Finally, Bill Wilson actually wrote that
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#freedom2think" target="_blank">we do not even have the right to think for ourselves</a>,
and that we are fortunate if alcohol destroys our brains and our ability to think
independently.


<p>
<a name="be_perfect"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, you don't have to be perfect, and then you do.
</font>
<p>
First, you can be just another degenerate alcoholic, full of failings
and &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;.
It's okay, because &quot;you're just one of us. Welcome to the club.&quot;
The slogans are,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are not saints,&quot;
</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Let us love you until you can love yourself.&quot;</font>
<p>
But then, you must flawlessly &quot;work a strong program&quot; or else you will die.
You have to go to lots of meetings and do the 12 Steps really well, or else you will die.
Bill says that you must do the 12 Steps to the very best of your ability, or else
you are
<a href="#death_warrant"><i>signing your own death warrant</i></a>...

<p>
<a name="vital"> </a>
And you better not fail to confess every dirty little secret in your Fifth Step, or else you are doomed:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<font color="#9F0000">
If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking.</font>
Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to
themselves certain facts about their lives.
Trying to avoid this humbling experience, they have turned to
<font color="#9F0000">easier methods.</font>
Almost invariably they got drunk.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, pages 72-73.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, you must be completely selfless and totally dedicated to doing the Will of God, or
else God won't like you, and He will let you die drunk in a gutter, and it will all be
your own fault.
<p>
And if you do relapse, it's all your own fault because you didn't &quot;really try&quot;, and you
didn't &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;.


<p>
<a name="constitutionally"> </a>
<a name="honesty"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b> First, they tell you that Alcoholics
Anonymous is a program of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, and then it's

At the start of every Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, they incant:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed
our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or
will not completely give themselves to this simple program,
usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of
being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates.
They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way.
They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a manner
of living which demands rigorous honesty.<br>

(<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, page 93.</font>)
<p><li> In fact, deny the religious nature of the program entirely, by
chanting the slogan
&quot;<a href="orange-recruit.html#stress_spiritual" target="_blank">It's spiritual, not religious</a>&quot;.
<p><li> Don't tell the truth about
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the real history of A.A.</a> to anyone.
<p><li> Don't tell the truth about
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">what the A.A. headquarters is doing now</a>.

<p><li> Don't tell
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">the real truth about

<p><li> Avoid discussing anything that is embarrassing to A.A. by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We have no opinion on outside issues.&quot;</font>
<font color="#9F0000">
(Just label everything that you don't want to hear an
&quot;outside issue&quot;.)
</font>

<p><li> Don't tell the truth about the real nature of alcoholism.
Don't admit that the &quot;spiritual disease&quot; doctrine is a bunch of superstitious nonsense.
Don't admit that 50% of the alcoholics who recover do it by tapering off into moderate drinking,
rather than by total abstinence.
<p><li>
Don't admit that A.A. is not the only way.  Never admit that 80%
of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year or more actually
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">do it on
their own, alone</a>, without A.A. or any other &quot;treatment program&quot;.

<p><li> Above all, never tell the truth about the horrendous dropout
rate and failure rate that A.A. has. Don't admit that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">95% of all
newcomers are gone in a year</a>, and that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#coin_table" target="_blank">only one or two in a thousand</a>
of the newcomers makes it to 20 years of sobriety in the program.
</ul>

<!-------------------------------------------------------
<P>
Then, for frosting on the cake, Bill Wilson gave this advice about rigorous honesty to
the wives of alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Frequently, you have felt obliged to tell your husband's employer and his friends
that he was sick, when as a matter of fact he was tight. Avoid answering these
questions as much as you can.<br>

But later, they tell you to do everything you can to use the health
and criminal justice systems to force people to join the 12-Step religion.

<a href="#Little_Red_Book2"><i>The Little Red Book</i> of Hazelden</a>
&#8212; a clone of <i>The Little Red Book of Chairman Mao</i> &#8212;
specifically teaches recruiters
to indoctrinate judges, doctors, and other officials as part
of the proselytizing work. It says that faithful A.A. members
can <i>carry the message</i> by:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
11. By telling the A.A. story to clergy members, doctors, judges,
educators, employers, or police officials if we know them well
enough to further the A.A. cause, or to help out a fellow member.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 128.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then that book even goes on to tell recruiters to teach the
judges, police, doctors, and other officials just
<i>what kind of people</i> A.A. wants coerced into attending
its meetings:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By educating doctors, the clergy, judges, police officials, and
industrial personnel regarding the type of people A.A. can help,
we will avoid flooding our ranks with an unwieldy preponderance
of nonalcoholics.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 137.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So much for the excuses that A.A. can't help it if the judges,
parole officers, and counselors force people to go to A.A. meetings.
</ul>
<p>
And Hazelden is merely echoing Bill Wilson's instructions.
In a 1939 letter from Bill to Earl T., a founding member of the
Chicago A.A. group, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

you will surely pick up some strong prospects after a bit.<br>

<p>

As one wit said,
<font color="blue">
&quot;A.A. is in the position of a snake who is being force-fed

</font>

<p>
<a name="death_threats"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, you get declarations of easy-going tolerance, and then, death threats.<br>
</font>
<p>
First, A.A. presents newcomers with a friendly, tolerant, smiley-face.
They start off by telling you
that A.A. is just a loose, easy-going fellowship, where
you don't have to believe anything, and
the Twelve Steps are only a &quot;suggested&quot; program for recovery.
<p>
But later, after you have joined, they will
show you the other face. They will threaten you with death, and tell you
that you are &quot;signing your own death warrant,&quot; if you
don't conform and do all of Bill Wilson's
Twelve Steps exactly as they dictate.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
But after they get you to join and start working the program, the
tone of the instructions changes:

<a name="vital_step"> </a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
The &quot;suggested&quot; steps have suddenly become &quot;vital steps&quot;,
and we might not survive alcoholism if we don't do Bill's Twelve Steps, he says.
On the second page of chapter 5 of the <i>Big Book</i>, the steps were
just &quot;suggested steps&quot;, but on the first page of
chapter 6 they have become &quot;vital steps&quot;.
<p>
And then, in his next book, Bill really cranked up the pressure.
Bill declared that alcoholics would die unless they followed his
instructions and did the 12 steps that he made up:<br>
<a name="death_warrant"> </a>
<p>
<blockquote>

Likewise, if someone quits drinking, that allegedly proves that the A.A. program works,
but if someone doesn't quit drinking, then it's his own fault for not working the program right.

First, A.A. will tell you that their cure for alcoholism works great &#8212;

great A.A. cure rate:<br>
<blockquote>

<p>
But then,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">when the majority of
the newcomers relapse</a>,
A.A. claims that it isn't responsible for the failures:

<ul>
<li>
&quot;<font color="#4f007f">He didn't really try.</font>&quot;
<li>
&quot;<font color="#4f007f">He must have held something back in his

They can't have it both ways.  They can't be in control of the patient's
life and health when the patient recovers &#8212; and due the credit for the success &#8212;
but not in control, and not at all responsible for the failure, when
the patient relapses (or just never quits drinking at all).<br>
<ul>
<li> Either the cure works, or it doesn't.<br>
<li> Either the program changes peoples' behavior, or it doesn't.<br>
<li> Either the program causes people to quit drinking, or it doesn't.
</ul>

<p>
Speaking of which, they never defined just what &quot;working the Program properly&quot; really means.
Often, they have a laundry list of things that you &quot;must&quot; do (after declaring that
<a href="#no_musts">there are no &quot;musts&quot; in A.A.</a>,
just suggestions), but they don't give a very precise definition of &quot;working the Program properly&quot;.
Considering that people's lives are at stake, giving precise instructions seems to be the least that
they could do.
<p>
&quot;Working the Program properly&quot; may include any or all of the following:
<ol>
<li> Quitting drinking. They have a slogan that says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Working the Steps won't make you quit drinking right; quitting drinking will make you work the Steps right.&quot;
</font><br>
<font color="blue">
So, essentially, the A.A. program demands that you
quit drinking and get healthy before you get the medicine.
</font>

<li> Admitting powerlessness. You must admit that you are powerless over alcohol.<br>
<font color="blue">
 They do not explain how
you can immediately quit drinking, so as to work the Steps properly, when you are powerless over alcohol.
</font>
<li> Admit that you are insane, and come to believe that a vague, unnamed, Higher Power will restore you to sanity.<br>
<font color="blue">
They do not explain how that is not an insane belief.
</font>
<li> Turn your will and your life over to the control of somebody or Something Else.<br>
<font color="blue">
They do not explain how that &quot;Something Else&quot; is not held responsible when things go wrong.
To use a Navy analogy, when a new man is made Captain of the ship, he is responsible if the ship runs aground
or sinks. He cannot blame a lowly sailor. The man who gives the orders is responsible.
</font>

<li> List and confess all of your sins.<br>
<font color="blue">
They do not explain what this has to do with drinking alcohol.
</font>
<li> Keep coming back to more meetings.
<li> Beg a Higher Power to fix whatever is wrong with you.<br>
<font color="blue">
They do not explain how this is not just wishful thinking.
</font>

<li> &quot;Make amends&quot; to everyone whom you ever offended.
<li> Conduct a s&eacute;ance and do whatever the voices in your head tell you to do.
Pray for God to tell you what to do and to give you the power to carry out the orders.<br>
<font color="blue">
Again, they do not explain how God is not responsible for disasters when He is the Captain of the ship, giving the orders.
</font>

<li> Go recruiting and get more people to join A.A.
</ol>
And that is supposed to somehow take away the desire to drink alcohol, and keep you from drinking alcohol.
But if it doesn't work, it isn't the fault of &quot;The Program&quot;.

<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, A.A. promoters claim that the 12-Step program causes
A.A. members to do good things, and they take full credit for members' good behavior,
but when A.A. members do bad things, like relapse, or rape and murder, A.A. promoters claim that the
Steps had nothing to do with it. And A.A. had no control over that person's behavior, so they
aren't to blame.
</font>

<p>
A.A. promoters and boosters routinely claim that practicing the 12-Step program causes all kinds
of good behavior, and &quot;spiritual&quot; benefits. An article in a magazine for counselors
made these grandiose claims about the effects of practicing the A.A. 12-Step program:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Most alcoholics began drinking abusively in their teens. 
From that point, alcohol became their method for coping with stress, and they apparently failed to develop much beyond the adolescent personality stage. The twelve step rehabilitation program of AA helps to complete that personality development process.
It also instills attitudes of positive spirituality, which will allow recovering alcoholics to deal effectively with the stresses of life and bring about a fulfilling and even joyful recovery. 
It does so by promoting the growth of a healthy ego in a nurturing environment. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
According to Khantzian and Mack, &quot;The spiritual dimension of AA helps to move a person from a less mature, childish self-centeredness toward a more mature form of object love&quot; (1989, p. 79). Essentially, the founders of AA understood that the transcendence of ego stimulates in the alcoholic a corresponding growth of positive spirituality. <br>
<!--
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
AA also serves as a kind of surrogate family to provide alcoholics with consistent unconditional love, trust, and acceptance, coupled with reality-testing and a respectful amount of direction and guidance. <br>
-->

...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As recovering alcoholics &quot;work the steps&quot; of the AA program, guided by their sponsors in the supportive family environment, they begin to develop positive spirituality. This is reflected in blossoming attitudes of unconditional love, acceptance, and trust in relationships with themselves, others, the world, life, and the God of their understanding. They come to believe that they are fundamentally okay even if their behaviors sometimes are not. They begin to love, accept, and trust themselves. <br>

<!--
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Feeling more secure in themselves, they find the confidence to risk reaching out to others. They find that many other AA members are worthy of their trust and friendship and need not be manipulated to provide them with satisfying personal relationships. They come to believe that other human beings are fundamentally okay even if their behaviors sometimes are not. They begin to experience loving, accepting, and trusting relationships with others. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As they see others in AA succeeding in the world in ways that are satisfying to them, even if not necessarily valued by society at large, and as they find that they too are beginning to fulfill their potential for personal development, they come to believe that the world (nature, community, work, school) is generally a safe place for them to enjoy life and become all that they are capable of becoming or wish to become. Accordingly, they come to love, accept, and trust the world. <br>
-->

...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As they begin to live life through satisfying relationships with themselves, with others, and with the world, they come to believe that life is okay. They no longer see it as a purely biological happenstance or some kind of cruel joke, but rather as a condition that has profound meaning and purpose for them. They come to love, accept, and trust life. For most members of AA, it is inconceivable that such life is not ordered and supported by a loving God. Accordingly, they come to love, accept, and trust God. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Those who achieve this level of spiritual development show the greatest happiness in recovery and seem to have the greatest sobriety. They seem to have a special presence about them, a kind of light in their eyes that draws newly recovering alcoholics to them like a magnet. They are the role models for all who are serious about their recovery. The most effective sponsors come from their ranks. They inspire all who are resolutely working the steps as well as those who have newly entered AA and have not yet committed themselves to its program.<br>

Even the 12 Steps themselves make grand claims of good effects. Step 12 originally said:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b>12. Having had a spiritual experience as the result of these steps...</b><br>
<p>
Alas, many A.A. members complained that they were not getting the big
 &quot;spiritual experience&quot;, or seeing God, from doing the
12 Steps,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">
 so Bill Wilson rewrote Step 12</a>. Now, the revised version says:<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<b>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps...</b>,<br>
<p>
...Whatever a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; is supposed to be...

<p>
But when A.A. members commit fraud, or
<a href="orange-letters62.html" target="_blank">murder</a>,
or
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">rape young female newcomers</a>,
suddenly it isn't the fault of A.A. or the 12-Step program, because A.A. had no
effect on that member, none at all, and A.A. is not in any way responsible for what happened, and
it's just so &quot;unfair&quot; to criticize the spirituality of A.A.:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;It isn't fair to condemn A.A. for the actions of some of its members.&quot;

It can't be your fault if you are really powerless over alcohol.<br>
If you can choose whether to drink alcohol, then you are not powerless over alcohol.

Bill Wilson declared that self-reliance was bad, very bad, and that dependency
was good.
According to Bill, self-confidence and will power are terrible things:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence.
Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned,
it was a total liability.
Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a mental obsession
so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 22.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous, there is no difference between self-reliance &#8212;
using your own intelligence to manage your life and take care of yourself &#8212;
and stubborn willfulness, deliberately disobeying the orders that come down from God.
<p>
The book <b><i>&quot;The A.A. Way Of Life; a reader by Bill&quot;</i></b>
is a collection of Bill Wilson's opinions on every subject,
published by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.
It has an index in the front of the book.
The entry for &quot;self-reliance&quot;, on page <i><b>viii</b></i> reads:
<center>
<font face="Helvetica, Sanserif, Courier" size="+2">
<b>Self-Reliance;</b> <i>see</i> <b>Will</b><br>
</font>
</center>
<p>
Then the entry for
<font face="Helvetica, Sanserif, Courier"><b>&quot;Will&quot;</b></font>
lists 26 items, all of which tell us what is
wrong with having a will, or being willful.
In Bill Wilson's crazy theology, anybody who had a will of his own was in direct conflict with
the Will of God.
The only acceptable morality was to be a grovelling slave of &quot;Higher Power&quot;
or &quot;God, as Bill Wilson understood Him&quot;, depending on &quot;Him&quot; to tell us what to
do with our lives:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
But then, when the A.A. &quot;program&quot; does not work, the A.A. promoters
declare that it is your own fault, and you should learn to rely on
yourself, and nobody is going to do the work for you:
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;You must work a strong program.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must <i>thoroughly</i> follow our path.&quot;

<li> &quot;AA or any other program will only work as good as the effort that ones puts into getting sober.&quot; [sic. sp.]
<li> &quot;It's not the program that fails people &#8212; it is people who fail themselves.&quot;

<font color="#4f007f"><b>
&quot;RARELY have we seen a person fail,

which implies that A.A. has a very high success rate.

<p><li>
And, again, in the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson bragged about the
great A.A. cure rate:<br>
<blockquote>

&quot;Of alcoholics who came to A.A.
<font color="#9F0000">and really tried</font>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.&quot;<br>

<font size="-2">

<p><li>
But when you challenge their grandiose claims, and ask for specific numbers about the
A.A. success rate, they run and hide behind statements like:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We don't like to discuss numbers or success rates. It is counter-productive.

At first, a recruiter will tell you
that A.A. has the answer, the best way to survive and recover from alcoholism.

is hopeless; modern medicine and modern science have no cure for alcoholism,
and the only answer is to abandon yourself to God and hope that God will save you.
<p>
<p>
First, they tell you that if you go to A.A. meetings and &quot;work the Steps&quot;,
and &quot;work a strong program&quot;, that you are &quot;in recovery&quot; (as

And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone, even alcohol. For by this time
sanity will have returned. We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted,
we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally, and we will

We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any

We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we
had been placed in a position of neutrality safe and protected. We have not even

<p>
But then, when most all of Bill Wilson's converts relapsed and returned
to a life of drinking, Bill changed the story to saying that you are not
cured of alcoholism: you
can't ever recover, and you must spend every day of the
rest of your life confessing and surrendering and seeking and doing
the will of God, and you still won't ever get cured:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily

</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
And since you are never cured, you can never leave Alcoholics Anonymous.
And you are constantly in danger of relapse.
One day of failing to &quot;carrying the vision&quot;, and you are dead.
Some miracle.

</ul>
The slogans are:
<ul>
<li>
&quot;The Steps don't work to make you quit drinking; you must quit drinking to work the Steps.&quot;
<li>
&quot;Working the Steps won't make you quit drinking right; quitting drinking will make you work the Steps right.&quot;
<li> 
&quot;You don't work the Steps to quit drinking; you quit drinking to work the Steps.&quot;

</ul>

<p>
<li> Similarly,<br>
<ul>
<li> first &quot;Higher Power&quot; will save you (because you are
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;) &#8212; you only have to &quot;turn your
will and your life over to the care of God&quot; in Step Three &#8212; <br>
<li> But then old Higher Power won't save you &#8212; you have to do all of the hard work yourself,
and if you don't succeed, it is because you are &quot;constitutionally dishonest with yourself&quot;,
and &quot;born that way&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Also, A.A. advertises on radio and television that &quot;there is an answer&quot;,
implying that A.A. can help you with a drinking
problem. But after membership is established, the story changes to &quot;you must work a strong program, or else.&quot;
&quot;You must absolutely abstain from drinking alcohol, or else.&quot;
You have to do all of the work, and then A.A. gets the credit.
</ul>

<p>
As one member said on the Internet:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I do believe that
<blockquote>
<i>
if I am _willing_ to stay sober,<br>
as _honest_ as I can be<br>
and if I keep an _open mind_,<br>
the steps will work _me_,<br>
</i>
</blockquote>
not the other way around.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A message on the Internet newsgroup <b>alt.recovery.aa</b></font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This A.A. member actually declared that:
<ul>
<li> The Twelve Steps won't make you quit drinking &#8212; it's
the other way around &#8212; you have to quit drinking in order to make the 12 Steps work.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(So why bother doing the 12 Steps if you have already quit drinking without them?)
</font>
<li> You have to practice the A.A. idea of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; by doing things like
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#pseudo_intellectual" target="_blank"><i>&quot;Fake It
Until You Make It&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Act As If&quot;</i></a>.
&quot;Rigorous Honesty&quot; also seems to involve
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting techniques</a>,
hiding the religious nature of the program from the newcomers,
only gradually revealing the truth about the program
<i>&quot;<a href="#teaspoons">By Teaspoons, Not Buckets</a>&quot;</i>.

<li> You have to <i>&quot;keep an open mind&quot;</i> by staying gullible
and not being skeptical of voodoo medicine and faith healing that obviously
has a very high failure rate.

<li> Only then will the Steps &quot;work for you&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
Work for you to do what?<br>
</i></font>
Work to convert you into
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#True_Believer" target="_blank">a true believer</a>
in a cult religion, that's what.<br>
Work to convert you to
&quot;<a href="orange-recruit.html#recruit_family" target="_blank">our way of life</a>&quot;.

<p><br>
Likewise, the first three steps imply that God will take care of you and fix you,
because you are incapable of fixing yourself. You need only turn your problems over
to God:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives
had become unmanageable.</b>
<li>
<b>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b>
<li>
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</ul>
<p>
Bill Wilson amplified this idea by declaring in the <i>Big Book</i> that 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us

</blockquote>
<p>
So we will supposedly get saved from alcoholism without any thought or effort on our part.
<a name="RARELY"> </a>
But, at the same time, Bill Wilson also declared that it was all our own
fault if &quot;Higher Power&quot; did not take care of us and remove our
alcoholism, because we didn't &quot;thoroughly&quot; follow Bill's path
and &quot;completely give ourselves&quot;,
and we were born dishonest. So first it's effortless, and then it isn't effortless.
First it's a miracle, and then it isn't.
First, it never fails, and then it doesn't work.
Bait and Switch.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
<font color="blue">

<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, A.A. is a great success and always has been, and then A.A. isn't a success, and never was.

Again, Bill Wilson made grandiose claims of success in order to promote his new cult:

<p>
And, again, in the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson bragged about the
great A.A. cure rate:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Of alcoholics who came to A.A.
<font color="#9F0000">and really tried</font>,

25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-2">
The <i>Big Book</i>, in the 1955 Foreword to the Second Edition, page XX.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
But later, Bill Wilson revealed that A.A. was
always a great failure. Cult religion just doesn't work as medical treatment.
When he wasn't lying about what a great success A.A. was, Bill Wilson revealed the
truth:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

At a memorial service for Dr. Bob, Bill Wilson actually bragged
about the pathetically low success rate of the whole A.A. program. (Bill was making
himself out to be a long-suffering hero, working tirelessly to promote Alcoholics
Anonymous.)
Bill described the early days of A.A. this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to

</blockquote>
<p>
<i><b>&quot;Take the bait&quot;?</b></i> Only a few percent of &quot;these drunks&quot;
would &quot;take the bait&quot;?
And what percentage of those new members who took the bait actually got sober and stayed sober? Even fewer.

<a name="redefine_words"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
Redefine Words: First a word means one thing, and then it means something else.
</font>
<p>
<ul>
<li> First, to the beginners, the word <i><b>sober</b></i> merely
means &quot;not intoxicated with alcohol&quot;, but later, the word
means something else, like being a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and
practicing the 12 Steps &quot;correctly&quot;, and being a &quot;spiritual&quot; person.
<p>
A.A. members will ask people who have quit drinking,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Are you really sober, or just abstaining?&quot;</font><br>
Which means,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Are you working the Alcoholics Anonymous program, or are you
just an outsider?&quot;<br>
</font>
In A.A. jargon, you can't be <i>sober</i> without &quot;working the
Steps&quot;; you are &quot;<i>only abstaining</i> from drinking alcohol&quot;
or &quot;only dry.&quot;
<p>
And then A.A. members will also speak of &quot;the quality of someone's
sobriety&quot; as if evaluating levels or degrees of spirituality.

<p>
<li> Likewise, A.A. gradually redefines the word &quot;recovery&quot;.
First it means recovering from the damage that alcohol did to your
body, but later it means practicing the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-Step
religion.

<p>
<a name="only_dry"> </a>
In one of the more
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">obnoxious pieces of A.A. propaganda</a>,

<p>

How can you possibly be <i>&quot;sober but nonrecovering&quot;</i>
when alcohol was the thing that was killing you, and you aren't
drinking it any more?
<p>
Simple:
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">A.A. redefines the word
&quot;recovery&quot;</a> to mean
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;doing the Twelve

So if you aren't practicing the A.A. 12-Step religion,

The A.A. true believers say that you will turn into a

<p>
<li>
We already covered <a href="#suggested">the twisting and redefinition
of the meaning of the word &quot;suggested&quot;</a> above.

<p>
<li>
The <i>Big Book</i> says of one man who didn't join A.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He stayed &quot;dry&quot; for thirteen years! Dr. Bob often
said that it was a record for what he felt was a typical alcoholic.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, <i>&quot;From Farm to City&quot;</i>,
by Ethel M., 3rd edition, page 263.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how the word &quot;dry&quot; is in quotes. This
man who abstained from both alcohol and Alcoholics Anonymous for thirteen years didn't quite
qualify as <i>really dry</i>, in the cultish authoress' mind.
Apparently, she felt that he was only just &quot;sort of dry&quot;,
without doing all of those meetings and those Twelve Steps.
Obviously, even the word &quot;dry&quot; meant something more to her
than just not drinking alcohol.
<p>
</ul>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Note that redefining words is a
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak" target="_blank">common cult practice</a>.
Words often have one meaning to outsiders
or prospective new recruits, and quite another meaning to the old-timer
insiders who are &quot;in the know&quot;.
A.A. has lots of that kind of
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">cult-speak</a>.

<p>
<a name="Step2"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, the insanity referred to in Step Two means that you have been
insanely drinking enough alcohol to kill you, but then &quot;insanity&quot;
means that you have not been living according to God's will.
</font>
<p>
Step Two says:<br>
<font size="+1">
<b>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b>
</font>
<p>
Naturally, the beginners assume that the step says that people have been drinking
too much alcohol and making themselves sick, and that such behavior is insane.
<p>
But later the religious content of the step is revealed &#8212;
To the old-timers, the &quot;insanity&quot; was living a life not
spent &quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot;, and
<b>&quot;Sanity is living according to God's Will, rather
than one's own.&quot;</b>
(It's the same thing as the cult leader
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane" target="_blank">Frank Buchman taught</a>
&#8212; that ordinary people were &quot;insane&quot; because they were not under
&quot;God-control&quot; and doing the will of God &#8212; that only Frank
and his boys were &quot;sane&quot;.)
<p>
So Step Two also means:

But Mr. Wilson claimed that the Twelve Steps had to be written
because alcoholics were so dishonest.
While writing the <i>Big Book</i>, he had this problem:

<p>
Note, once again, Bill Wilson's actual contempt for his fellow
alcoholics.
A.A. isn't a &quot;fellowship of equals&quot; or a self-help group, it's
a dictatorship where Bill Wilson gives the orders:
<ul>
<p>
<li> &quot;These drunks&quot; will try to cheat on &quot;this
deal&quot;, and they will &quot;wiggle out of&quot; Bill Wilson's
&quot;principles&quot; if they can get away with it.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The negative
stereotyper strikes again</a>:
<font color="#4f007f">
Alcoholics are just irresponsible immoral children who must be
forced to be good by cutting them no slack whatsoever, and giving
them no wiggle room.&quot;</i><br>

And then Bill Wilson bragged about the nature of Alcoholics Anonymous in his history
of A.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
Today, the A.A. headquarters is certainly commanding and controlling and exercising power over others.
They, through surrogates, sued A.A. members in Germany and Mexico to keep those people from publishing
their own translations of the old, out-of-copyright first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>. Representatives
of the A.A. headquarters committed perjury in the courtrooms of Mexico and Germany to claim that they
still had a copyright on the book. The result was that a German alcoholic was bankrupted, and a Mexican
alcoholic was sentenced to a year in prison.

<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#freedom2think" target="_blank">

The recruiting manual in Chapter Seven of the <i>Big Book</i>,

That really isn't an exaggeration at all. Read
Bill Wilson's second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
pages 143 to 145, where you will find the story of Ed,
who refused to believe in God, and said so, loudly.
Bill's solution to the problem of having a disobedient unbeliever
in A.A. was to cold-shoulder him,
to ostracize him and squeeze him out, and then to let him die alone
when he relapsed. (See the full story

control of their lives to Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; you cannot
&quot;continue to run the show yourself&quot; &#8212; and the
 euphemistic language, &quot;the suggested program&quot;. When the demand is
backed up by a death threat, it isn't a suggestion.

<p>
Also notice the logical contradiction &#8212; the condemnation of those
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;who choose negativity and continue...&quot;

But A.A. Step One says that alcoholics are powerless over alcohol.
They don't and can't have any power to choose
either negativity or salvation if they are powerless.<br>
But this A.A. cheerleader says that alcoholics <i>choose</i> their fate.
So they aren't powerless over alcohol.

According to A.A.,

(And once again, they are
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#symptom" target="_blank">misusing the word <i>symptom</i></a>, and confusing it

<p>
<font color="blue">
Even the word <i>&quot;disease&quot;</i> is itself subjected to this same
gradual twisting and changing of meaning.
In the beginning, newcomers are told that alcoholism is a disease, pure and simple &#8212;

diabetes or cancer or TB&quot;</i>.
Newcomers are told that even the

alcoholism is a disease, and that alcoholics are sick people.

Certainly, however, the spiritual dimension that is so strong in AA

If A.A. works, then groups of alcoholics who get A.A.-based &quot;treatment&quot; should

Alcoholics suffer from what AA calls &quot;character defects&quot; (AA World
Services, 1976, p. 59). These are feelings, beliefs, and behaviors that
dispose them to seek a sense of well-being by abusing alcohol. Such
&quot;character defects&quot; are frequently reflective of a pathological
narcissism, in which those addicted to alcohol behave as though they were
the center of their universe or their own God (Kurtz, 1979). Alcoholics
also possess an underlying codependency involving an alienation from their
true selves and an inability to establish functional relationships with
significant others in their lives (Whitfield, 1989). The combination of
these biological and character risk factors makes alcoholism difficult to
treat and makes the recovering alcoholic vulnerable to relapse.<br>

Still others will call it an index of maladjustments.

<a href="orange-powerless.html#Silkworths_theory" target="_blank">Dr. Silkworth's disease theory of alcoholism</a>
 relieved him of his feelings of guilt &#8212; 
his outrageous alcoholic behavior wasn't really his fault after all, he said,
because he was powerless over alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;
Bill listened, entranced, as Silkworth explained his theory. For the first
time in his life, Bill was hearing about alcoholism not as a lack of willpower,
not as a moral defect, but as a legitimate illness. It was Dr. Silkworth's theory
 &#8212; unique at the time &#8212; that alcoholism was the combination of this mysterious
physical &quot;allergy&quot; and the compulsion to drink; that alcoholism could no more
be &quot;defeated&quot; by willpower than could tuberculosis. Bill's relief was immense.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
So, in the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will is amazingly
weakened when it comes to combating liquor, though if often remains strong
in other respects. My incredible behavior in the face of a desperate
desire to stop was explained.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 1, &quot;Bill's Story&quot;, page 7.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But then Bill Wilson completely reversed the story, and declared that
your alcoholism was all your own fault:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">  
After all, our problems were of our own making. Bottles were only a symbol.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">  
But it is clear that we made our own misery. God didn't do it.<br>
</font>

<p>
So how is it our own fault if we inherited a harmful gene from one of our parents?

<p>
<li> And then when you are making more lists and amends, in Steps Eight

<p>
<li> That is contradictory; you
can't be both powerless over alcohol, diseased, and unable to control your
drinking, and also personally responsible for what you did while you were
drunk. One piece of A.A. literature called it a &quot;paradox&quot;.
It isn't a paradox, it's a contradiction, and it's just plain wrong.
<p>
<font color="blue">
(In my humble opinion, you are responsible because you are not powerless
over alcohol. Not coincidentally, the law of the land also says that you
are responsible for your actions, even if you are drunk. When drunk
drivers kill people, they don't get excused because they were &quot;powerless

<p>

But then, after we have joined A.A. and worked a few Steps, we suddenly find A.A. making us feel
horribly guilty, having to confess to our sponsors, in Steps Four and Five,
everything we ever did wrong in our entire lives:
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>&quot;the exact nature of our wrongs&quot;</b>:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Whoops! Wow. &quot;Moral inventory&quot; and &quot;our wrongs&quot;? What happened to &quot;not a moral stigma&quot;? 
</font>
<p>
For that matter, if it isn't a moral stigma, why do all of the alcoholics
have to be &quot;anonymous&quot;, and hide their real names?
<p>

And if it isn't a moral stigma, why do those people who have
abstained from drinking for years have all of the status?
Why is someone with 20 years of Time considered wiser and more holy
than someone who relapses regularly?
<p>
Because alcoholism is a moral stigma, of course. And failure to quit drinking is
considered a moral shortcoming and a &quot;defect of character&quot;.

<p>
A woman who has overcome breast cancer is not considered more moral
than one who is still battling it (just luckier),
and a man who is still battling
prostate cancer is not considered less moral than someone who has
overcome it. But an alcoholic who is still getting drunk all of the
time is most assuredly considered less holy, less moral, and less wise
than someone who has abstained for years.
<p>
Of course it's a moral stigma.

<p>
First, Alcoholics Anonymous claims that it wants to reduce the stigma
of alcoholism &#8212; &quot;It's a disease, not a moral shortcoming.&quot;

&quot;NCADD fights the stigma and the disease of alcoholism and other drug addictions.&quot;
</font>

<p>
But then comes the switch, where newcomers to Alcoholics Anonymous gradually
learn that Bill Wilson really considered alcoholism to be a disgusting sin that was
<a href="orange-secrets.html#cause_list" target="_blank">actually caused by 'self and selfishness
and self-seeking and pride and trying to get your own way all of the time'</a>,
and the only cure for alcoholism is to get down on your
knees and confess all of your sins.
And then the newcomer will learn that alcoholics are all dishonest and weak-willed
and &quot;thinking alcoholically&quot; and &quot;in denial&quot;, and on and on.
<p>
See the web page
<b>&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i> Conspiracy</a>&quot;</b>
for much more on how A.A. shames alcoholics and constantly puts them down with an extremely negative stereotype.

<p>
Promoters of A.A. actually declare that you should not tell the truth about
&quot;alcoholism&quot; to alcoholics,
because those stupid weak-willed fools just can't handle the truth.
You will kill them. They say that,
&quot;<a href="orange-disservice.html" target="_blank">You are doing a great disservice
to those who are seeking sobriety</a>.&quot;
<p>
When the Rand Corporation released a study that found that half of the recovered alcoholics did it
by tapering off into controlled drinking rather than by absolute abstinence,
the A.A. true believers went ballistic and declared that the
authors of the study were killing alcoholics by &quot;giving them an excuse to drink.&quot;

A more reasonable person, Morris Chafetz, responded,

If there be divorce or separation, there should be no undue haste

The wife should fully understand his new way of life. If their old

new attitude and spirit all around. Sometimes it is to the best

My friend had emphasized <font color="#9F0000">the absolute necessity</font>

Faith without works was dead, he said.
And how appallingly true for the alcoholic!
For if an alcoholic failed to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life
through work and self-sacrifice for others, he could not survive the
certain trials and low spots ahead. If he did not work, he would surely
drink again, and if he drank, he would surely die.
Then faith would be dead indeed. With us it is just like that.<br>

<p>
<a name="problem"> </a>
<br>
<font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, they tell you that &quot;You must admit that you have a problem&quot;, but then that
 gets changed into &quot;You must admit that you are powerless and you have
a disease from which you can never recover.&quot;
</font>
<p>
In addition, you must admit that you are an &quot;alcoholic&quot;, which means that you
are selfish and dishonest and manipulative, and cannot ever be fixed, and your
only hope of avoiding Hell is to &quot;surrender&quot; to a &quot;Higher Power&quot;
who can be anything from a &quot;god&quot; to a stone idol or a bedpan or a doorknob,
and follow his orders for the rest of your life.
<p>
That is quite a change from just admitting that you have a problem.


<p>
<a name="political"> </a>
<br>
<font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First it isn't political, and then it is.
</font>
<p>
They start off by telling you that Alcoholics Anonymous has no politics &#8212;
A.A. has no opinion on &quot;outside issues&quot;, and will not concern itself with
controversies outside of the realm of recovery.
<p>
But the A.A. program is actually very political, because it
removes people from the political sphere, and turns them into political
eunuchs. It also makes them into reactionaries. People are taught to blame
themselves for everything, and to never consider how their problems
may have been caused by or at least exacerbated by societal problems.
A.A. members then likewise blame other alcoholics for their own troubles,
imagining that &quot;character defects&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
are the cause of all of the other alcoholics' problems.
The Twelve Steps and the rest of Bill Wilson's religious teachings
talk solely about how alcoholism is the fault of the
individual. The A.A. answer is solely that,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are bad. You are selfish.&quot;
</font>
They never consider or even mention the influence of
any external contributing factors like poverty,
racial discrimination, social injustice, war, unemployment,
bad environments, broken families, sickness and pain, or past child abuse.
They never consider that alcoholics may have been the victims
of crimes, rather than the perpetrators of crimes.
<p>
In addition, Alcoholics Anonymous and its other 12-Step brethren
basically promote a fascist philosophy &#8212;
<ul>
<p><li> People declare
themselves to be powerless over their problems,
mentally incompetent,
and unfit to run their own lives, so they become
dependent on a dictatorial &quot;higher power&quot; who will order them around
and tell them what to do with their lives.
<p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><li>
That also usually means, &quot;Get a sponsor to tell you what to do.&quot;
The sponsor system is dictatorial and undemocratic &#8212; it arranges the
members in a pyramid-shaped hierarchy of command and control
with the old-timers at the top. (While some A.A. apologists will
claim that sponsees are free to dump their sponsor at any time,
that is not entirely true. When people are repeatedly told that they must
follow the program exactly, completely, to the best of their ability,
<a href="#death_warrant">or else they will die</a>, and they believe it,
that removes the element of free will.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#emotions" target="_blank">Fear-mongering</a>
keeps the members in line.)
<p>
<a name="what2think"> </a>
<li> Bill Wilson declared that we do not even have the right to decide
all by ourselves just what we shall think or how we shall act:
<p>
<blockquote>

In A.A. there is active still another form of association, a form of which
the world is today in great doubt. It has its virtues, nevertheless,
especially for us of Alcoholics Anonymous: I am speaking of dictatorship.
In A.A. we have two dictators, and we profit and grow through both.
One is John Barleycorn, who is never very far from the elbow of each of us.
The other is the Father of Lights, who presides over all men.
God is saying to us, &quot;Learn my will and do it.&quot; And John Barleycorn is saying

Why all this insistence that every A.A. member must hit bottom first?
The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the A.A.
program unless they have hit bottom. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Under the lash of alcoholism, we are driven to A.A., and there
we discover the fatal nature of our situation.

As in any hegemonic discourse or ritual, the absence of apparent ideology
is itself the most powerful kind of ideology, since it can never be
acknowledged or questioned. The political implications of this kind
of thinking, this kind of process, are apparent and depressing. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This reactionary tendency of AA is further bolstered by its tendency to exclude
contact with all &quot;outsiders&quot; who may indeed have other ideas about
what has caused a member's suffering and what might be done to assuage it.
One of the characteristics of cults described by
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Deikman" target="_blank">Arthur Deikman (1990)</a> is a
tendency to &quot;devalue outsiders&quot; and assume &quot;an attitude of
righteousness&quot; about one's own customs and beliefs. In AA and (to a lesser
degree) other recovery groups, this takes the form of labeling as &quot;in denial&quot;
those who question basic tenets.
David Forbes, for example, in a fairly sympathetic analysis by a former
participant, reports on his discomfort at &quot;the conformist norm
of the language&quot; and the prohibition against the kind of
&quot;political and theoretical categories and constructs&quot;
he normally used to speak about his life, &quot;especially class and
patriarchy.&quot; And while he insists that such concerns could be
discussed in the socializing time that generally follows meetings,
he admits that he &quot;did not find many people who were interested
in doing so&quot; (Forbes 1994, p. 244). Nor did I.
I did indeed hear a member, a young man, express discomfort about this
language in a social gathering after a meeting. He was told by an
&quot;old-timer&quot; that he would &quot;get over&quot; his &quot;denial&quot;
when he had successfully managed to &quot;do the First Step&quot; and
make contact with his own Higher Power. The young man never broached
the subject again to my knowledge, but he soon stopped attending
meetings.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Those who find the groups most helpful, on the other hand, tend to
incorporate the religious and social underpinnings of the movement
more and more automatically, internalizing them as unquestioned truths.
I heard so many, many people in so many, many groups make statements
like this one by a young woman in an OA meeting:
&quot;Now that I've learned to trust my Higher Power, I realize
that there is joy everywhere and a purpose to everything.
Even when I pass by the homeless people who used to make me feel
so sad and upset with this society I can feel peace and trust in
God's love. There is glory everywhere, I now realize.&quot;<br>

Indeed. Bill Wilson taught that we must accept <i>anything</i>
as God's will, and not be upset or disturbed by it:
<p>
<a name="no_anger"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about
&quot;justifiable&quot; anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't
we entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly angry with self-righteous
folk? For us in A.A. these are dangerous exceptions.
We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those
better qualified to handle it.<br>

<font color="blue">
We can't be angry? We must always be passive doormats,
and never get angry, no matter what anybody else does to us?<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(That will sure kill any social activism or attempts to fix the world.)<br>
</font>
Only &quot;normal&quot; people can handle righteous anger or
resentment and fight back when harmed, and we cannot, because we
are just stupid alcoholics?  Well, the <i>Big Book</i> says,

Women shouldn't have gotten the vote; they should have just accepted their lot

<a name="Elayne_Rapping2"> </a>
Elayne Rapping described the process of depoliticization very well.
For her book, she observed
many 12-Step groups, including A.A., S.A. (Sex Addicts Anonymous), O.A.
(Overeaters Anonymous), and CODA (Codependents Anonymous),
and then she told the story of one young woman who had found happiness in O.A.:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Unfortunately, this rare success story scored a point for God not women.
As this woman became more and more committed to her program, she also
became more and more oblivious to social injustice and more and more
smug in her certainty that her Higher Power was responsible for all her new
joy in life while the miseries of others were also firmly in His hands and so,
somehow, serving His purpose. This was the young woman who learned to disregard
the homeless who had previously so bothered her because her new faith in God
assured her that all &#8212; even their misery &#8212; was right with the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In every case in which I saw an OA member dramatically
&quot;recover,&quot; she became radically religious in ways I found disturbing.
The women who worked their programs as effectively as the men in AA and SA
became as religious and spiritual in their worldviews and activities as these
men had become. Only this time much more was lost than was gained, in social
terms. To a woman, their recovery meant that spirituality became their entire
lives, altering partners, professions, social activities, and &#8212; not surprisingly &#8212; 
social and political beliefs in alarmingly reactionary ways.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... And their binges, their urges to binge, their purges and fasts, were all
explained in this depoliticized, indeed politically regressive, worldview.<br>

<p>
That leads to the next item:

<p>
<a name="Calvinist"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>

 First, Bill Wilson declared that
the A.A. religious dogma was just the perennial Christian philosophy,
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2common_folk" target="_blank">common to all denominations</a>&quot;,
but then it isn't Christian at all.  It's a strange kind of
<a href="orange-heresy.html#childhood" target="_blank">Calvinist</a>
social Darwinism that believes in pre-destination.</font>
<p>
In the final analysis, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and
their other 12-Step kin have the same social philosophy as
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group</a> cult.
Buchman declared that
that <i>all</i> social problems, including alcoholism and drug addiction,
are caused by individual sin, and that the answer to all such social
problems was to get &quot;changed&quot; into a group member, and then
get down on your knees and start confessing your sins.
So you can forget about any social activism, human rights campaigns,
or saving the whales. That is actually a very political attitude &#8212; 
a philosophy of passivity and inactivity.
As the band <i>Rush</i> sings (in the song <i>Free Will</i>),<br>
<center>
<font color="blue">
&quot;If you choose not to decide,<br>
you still have made a choice.<br>
... I will choose free will.&quot;
</font>
</center>
<p>
Such a social philosophy also smacks of Social Darwinism. It is the alcoholics'
own fault if they won't get religion and get down on their knees and confess their sins.
They are just being
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#constitutionally" target="_blank"><i>constitutionally dishonest
with themselves</a> </i>&quot; &#8212; &quot;<i>they seem to have been born that way</i>&quot; &#8212; 
they are just spiritually inferior (and genetically inferior), and you shouldn't worry about them.
The more honest and spiritual ones will survive, and the inferior specimens will die...
Who needs those disgusting <i>Untermenschen</i> anyway?
<p>
The A.A. slogan is,
<center>
 <b>&quot;Some must die so that others may live.&quot;</b>
</center>
<p>
It must be the will of God:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those who do not recover are ... men and women who are constitutionally
incapable of being honest with themselves.
They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd and 4th Edition, page 58.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<i>So, as God selects which sperm cell hits the egg, God observes that this baby
is going to be born an alcoholic, and constitutionally dishonest with himself too.
This one is doomed to die drunk in a gutter. He can't help it &#8212; he was
born that way. His fate is inevitable and unavoidable.</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So how is that a Christian philosophy?
(<a href="orange-heresy.html#inherited_sin" target="_blank">It isn't. It isn't Christian at all</a>.)

<p>
It is also reminiscent of Heinrich Himmler's ideas of bad genes. The Nazis were
big on eugenics, and sterilized and euthenized (with gas chambers) many thousands
of people whom they regarded as &quot;genetically defective&quot;. Alcoholism was
considered to be one of the genetic defects that warranted sterilization or death.

<p>
<a name="speak"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
First, no one is entitled to speak for A.A., but
then some special privileged people <i>are entitled</i> to speak for A.A.</a>
</font>
<p>
A standard A.A. slogan is that &quot;No one is entitled to speak for A.A.&quot;.
But people speak for A.A. all of the time. A.A. promoters and pundits routinely
go on radio and TV, and write articles for newspapers and magazines and the Internet,
praising A.A., and nobody criticizes them for &quot;speaking for A.A.&quot;.
<p>
One standard way of claiming the privilege of speaking for A.A. is to announce one's
sober time.
An A.A. old-timer stands up and brags about himself like this:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Hello. My name is Joe, and by the Grace of God and Alcoholics 
Anonymous, I haven't taken a drink in 15 years.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Thus, he has established his credentials, and now he is entitled to speak with authority
about Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
In general, if somebody has something positive to say about Alcoholics Anonymous,
then he is entitled to speak. It's quite all right. But if someone has something negative
to say about A.A., then he is not entitled to speak for A.A.

<p>
<a name="progressive_terminology"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b>
Progressive Terminology:
First, they tell you to do an honest, complete, &quot;moral inventory&quot;,
and then they tell you to only talk about your &quot;wrongs&quot; and
&quot;character defects&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;.
</font>
<p>
While we are busy confessing all of our sins, note the funny progressive
change in the terminology of the Steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of
ourselves.</b><br>
<li> <b>5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being
the exact nature of our wrongs.</b><br>
<li> <b>6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of
character.</b><br>
<li> <b>7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</b><br>
</ul>
<p>

In Step Four, we start off doing a general-purpose moral inventory, which
sounds like we should honestly list both the good and the bad stuff
 &#8212; our weaknesses <b><i>and</i></b> our strengths &#8212; but
<ul>
<li> in
Step Five we only &quot;admit&quot; (confess) our
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;wrongs&quot;</font>;
<li> and in Step Six those
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;wrongs&quot;</font> suddenly get changed
into defective parts of ourselves &#8212; our
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;defects of character&quot;</font>,
<li> and in Step Seven, they are again our defects, our
<font color="#4f007f">moral &quot;shortcomings&quot;</font>.
</ul>
<p>
There is a big difference between making a stupid mistake and having a
defective character. Again, these steps are just inducing more feelings of guilt,
self-doubt, and inadequacy by declaring that we are inherently defective and
flawed &#8212; so terribly flawed that only God can remove the defects.

<p>
Such progressive terminology also pushes
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_progressive_commitments" target="_blank"><i>Progressive Commitments</i></a>,
which is another standard cult characteristic.
In the beginning, you only agreed to conduct an accurate and honest self-examination.
But without anyone asking your permission, Bill Wilson twisted it into
a guilt-inducing confession session.

<p>
Likewise, there is a progressive change in attitude as we go through the Steps,
from standing tall to grovelling on our knees.
In the beginning, we just arrogantly presume that God will give us the goodies
 &#8212; will fix our minds and restore us to sanity and take care of our wills and our lives for us
in Steps 2 and 3 &#8212; 
for no particular reason other than that we shoved our broken minds and lives at Him,
and expected Him to repair them for us.<br>
<font color="blue">
(Which is in fact
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="_blank">a heretical religious doctrine</a>.
Nowhere in the Bible does it say that God has to do His side of that deal.)
</font>

<p>
But by Step Seven, we have to humbly beg God to help us:
<ul>
<font size="+1" color="#4f007f"><b>
<li> 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(We just presume that He will do it, without even asking Him what He wants to do.)
</font>
<b><li> 3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(We just presume that God will take care of us from now on, just because we
want Him to solve all of our problems for us.)
</font>
<b><li> 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.<br>
</b></font>
<font color="#9F0000">
(The original version of Step Seven that Bill Wilson wrote said,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Humbly, on our knees, asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;</font>)
</font>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="egomania_humility"> </a>
<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b> First, ego-mania, and then abject humility.
First, they give you happiness, and then they give you sadness.
</font>
<p>
<ul>
<li> First, in Steps Two and Three, you are supposed
to believe that you are so special and so favored that God is going to
wait on you hand and foot, take care of you,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#solve_all" target="_blank">solve all of your problems</a>
for you, restore you to sanity,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#prayer3" target="_blank">take away all of
your difficulties</a>,
take away your cravings for alcohol, and make the drink problem
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">just disappear</a>
on a daily basis.
<li> Then, when you have gotten a sufficiently
fat head from that, you must grovel and wallow in guilt
in Steps Four through Ten,
listing and confessing your every sin, defect, wrong, and moral shortcoming,
and everybody you ever harmed or offended,
until you have no self-respect or self-confidence left,
and you feel thoroughly rotten.
<li> Then Step Ten tells you to repeat that routine endlessly, and promptly admit whenever you are wrong.
That sounds like a good formula for neurosis.
</ul>

<p>
Incidentally, that pattern of behavior is called &quot;battering&quot;.
It is the same routine as what battered wives suffer through.
First, their husbands are friendly and loving, but then they turn against their
wives and threaten and terrorize and beat them.
Just when the wives are ready to leave them, the battering
husbands revert to being loving and reassuring, telling the wives that
things will be better in the future and that they didn't really mean it
and they love them. Then, when the wives stay, the
husbands revert to attacking and beating them again. Eventually,
the battered wives are so paralyzed by confusion and fear
that they don't know if they are coming or going.
<p>
A.A. does the same thing to its victims. There is a constant alternation
between<br>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;God loves you and is taking care of you&quot;</i>
</font>
and<br>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;God is disgusted with you for your many moral shortcomings and
defects of character. You are selfish and evil and self-seeking and manipulative
and dishonest.
You can hardly make amends even if you try for the rest of your life.&quot;</i>

You must reduce your self-respect and feelings of self-worth to
less than nothing.
<p><li> Then, in Step Eleven, you suddenly discover that you are so big and
so good that you are a secret agent for God &#8212; that your true mission

<p>

Bill Wilson had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html##spiritualexperience" target="_blank">a fantastic
vision or hallucination or &quot;religious experience&quot; or
&quot;spiritual experience&quot;</a>
while he was in the hospital, detoxing from alcohol and tripping on
belladonna and henbane and morphine and a bunch of other drugs.
Then he claimed that his copy of the Oxford Group practices &#8212; 
the Twelve Steps &#8212; would induce such an experience or vision in other
people without the drugs. The original version of Step Twelve, as
published in the early printings of the <i>Big Book</i>, began:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>Having had a spiritual experience as the result of this course of action...</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But after publication of the first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>,
A.A. members all over the country complained that
<i><b>&quot;The Big Experience&quot;</b></i> wasn't happening for them.
Nobody got wonderful religious or spiritual experiences, or saw God, as a result of
doing Bill's 12 steps...
<p>
So Bill Wilson changed the &quot;spiritual experience&quot; term in Step Twelve to
&quot;spiritual awakening&quot;.
Now Step Twelve begins,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps...&quot;</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Spiritual awakening&quot;</i>? That is so vague that it can mean just about anything.
</font>

<p>
Even the &quot;spiritual experience&quot; phrase
itself had already been the result of such rewording &#8212; 
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#William_James" target="_blank">William James'</a>
book was titled <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, and that's
what Bill Wilson talked about in the beginning, and that's what Bill Wilson
sought to induce in other people &#8212; <i>an overwhelming dramatic religious experience</i>.

<p>
Wilson wanted to induce religious experiences that were so powerful and stirring
that they would instantly transform people's lives, and
make them quit drinking forever.
But the word &quot;religious&quot; was a problem, remember &#8212; 
Bill Wilson didn't want to offend the Catholic Church. A Catholic priest
reminded Bill that inducing religious experiences was The Church's job, not Bill's.
So &quot;religious experience&quot; became &quot;spiritual
experience&quot;
which then got toned down to just a &quot;spiritual awakening.&quot;

<p>
Then Bill added an appendix to the second and third editions of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#religious_experience" target="_blank"><i>&quot;Appendix II,
Spiritual Experience&quot;</i></a>,
where he explained that members should not expect
<b>&quot;sudden and spectacular upheavals&quot;</b>
or expect to <b>&quot;acquire an immediate and overwhelming
'God-consciousness' followed at once by a vast change in feeling
and outlook&quot;</b>, like Bill Wilson said that he had gotten
(<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">from
hallucinogenic drugs</a>) and had written
about at length in the front section of the <i>Big Book</i>.
No, Bill said, members should not really expect any such sudden
or dramatic results;
rather, they should just settle for small, slow, gradual changes,
like an &quot;educational experience&quot;, or like the hang-over
slowly clearing, and then call that a &quot;spiritual experience.&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue">
So the wonderful dramatic &quot;electric&quot; experiences that Bill Wilson wrote
about in the front of the <i>Big Book</i> aren't going to happen for you,
after all:
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terms &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and
&quot;spiritual awakening&quot; are used many times in this book
which, upon careful reading, shows that
<font color="#9F0000">the personality change sufficient to bring about
recovery from alcoholism</font> has manifested itself among us in many
different forms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the
impression that
<font color="#9F0000">these personality changes, or
religious experiences</font>,
must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals.
Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Most of our experiences are what the psychologist William James
<font color="blue">
[in his book <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>]</font>
calls
<font color="#9F0000">the &quot;educational variety&quot;</font>
because they develop slowly over a period of time.
Quite often friends of the newcomer
are aware of the difference long before he is himself.
He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in
his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been
brought about by himself alone.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 569.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, the changes haven't been &quot;brought about by himself alone.&quot;
The good changes are caused by quitting drinking. The bad changes,
the ones he isn't supposed to be aware of until it is too late,
are caused by mind-control techniques and indoctrination in cult
religion.
</font>

<p>

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
And don't you love the part about how
you won't be aware of what &quot;profound alterations&quot;
they are doing to your mind until much later? Your friends can see it, but
you can't.
<p>
Both
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">
Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer and Dr. Edgar H. Schein</a> listed that as one of the
key components of an effective brainwashing or thought-control program:<br>
<font color="green">

of how they are being changed, step by step.&quot; &#8212; Singer.<br>
&quot;Keep the person unaware of what is going on and the changes taking place.&quot; &#8212; 
Schein.
</font>

<p>
Also note that Bill Wilson plainly stated that the goal is to induce
<i><b>religious experiences</b></i> sufficiently powerful to cause
dramatic and permanent personality changes. That contradicts the slogan that
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">It's spiritual, not religious</a>.&quot;
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
<ul>
<li> So, the
<ul>
<li> &quot;religious experience&quot; got reduced to a
<li> &quot;spiritual experience&quot;, which got reduced to a
<li> &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;, which got reduced to an
<li> &quot;educational experience&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Just about anything will qualify as your &quot;educational experience&quot;,
or your &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;.<br>
<font color="blue">
(Heck, if I want an educational experience, I can watch Public Television,
or read a good book.)<br>
</font>

<p>
<li> So, if your head is clearer now than it was when you were drunk,
then, by golly, you have already had a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;
without even noticing it.<br>

</ul>

<p>
Bill Wilson did not get his &quot;spiritual experience&quot; 
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#not12" target="_blank">from doing the Twelve Steps</a> and
confessing all of his sins and wallowing in guilt.
Bill actually got his
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">electric results</a>&quot;,
and saw God, while detoxing in a hospital and tripping on 
a combination of alcohol withdrawal,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#rational_mind" target="_blank"><i>delirium tremens</i></a>, and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna_recipe" target="_blank">a hallucinogenic drug cocktail</a>
that contained belladonna, henbane, morphine, strychnine, and a bunch of other things.
But Bill didn't bother to mention that small detail in the <i>Big Book</i>...

<p>
What Bill did mention was that, the next day, one of his friends, either
Ebby Thacher or Rowland Hazard,
gave him the book <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i> by
William James, and Bill read
about other people having had similar religious experiences when they
were really down, sick, in despair, and dying. (Note: James' book was about
<b><i>religious</i></b> experiences, not &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences.)
From reading that book,
Bill Wilson came to believe that he had had a religious experience,
and that
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#Silkworth_fear_induction" target="_blank">deflating
peoples' egos</a>&quot; and crushing them into
<a href="orange-recruit.html#hopeless1" target="_blank">hopelessness</a>
would duplicate the religious or &quot;spiritual&quot;
experience in them without the drugs.

<p>
It didn't work. It still doesn't work. It just makes some A.A. members neurotic,
bitter and frustrated, while they wait forever for &quot;The Miracle&quot; to happen.
<p>
It also makes some members delusional, where they mindlessly, frivolously, proclaim that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_giggly" target="_blank">every little
sentimental rush</a> or emotional reaction that they get is a big 'spiritual' experience...
<p>
It even makes some members suicidal.

<p>
<center><table width="94%" border="4" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

In a way, Bill Wilson was ahead of his time. In the nineteen-sixties
and seventies there were many phony gurus who came here from foreign
countries &#8212; most often from India &#8212; and told the kids that they
had some special yoga or chanting or meditation or something that
would duplicate the LSD religious or spiritual experience, without
the drugs.
They cheated the kids out of a lot of money before the kids wised up.
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
That same bait-and-switch stunt is still being pulled on new A.A.
members today. Initially, they are led to believe that they
will experience revolutionary changes in their lives,
and will have wonderful dramatic religious or spiritual experiences just
like Bill Wilson described in the <i>Big Book</i>, and also described later on in
his second book <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.

<p>
The slogan is,
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Don't leave five minutes before the Miracle!&quot;</b><br></font>

So you can't ever leave, or you will miss <i>The Big Experience</i>
that might have happened five minutes later.
(<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_no_exit" target="_blank"><i>No Exit</i></a> is
another standard cult characteristic.)
<p>
Only later are the newcomers told that they should
consider any small improvements that have happened in their lives to be
a <i>&quot;Miracle&quot;</i> and
a big <i>&quot;spiritual awakening&quot;</i>.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, you aren't drinking any more, are you? Isn't that a
Miracle?&quot;
</font>
<p>
You aren't supposed to answer:
<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;A Miracle? No, I don't think so. It looks a lot like
simple common sense &#8212; I just got sick and tired of being
sick and tired, so I finally got my act together and quit
doing it. I thank God for my sobriety, but I wouldn't
call it a 'Miracle'. A miracle is when somebody
uses supernatural powers to break the laws of physics.
No such powers were used here, and no such laws were broken.
I just quit drinking alcohol.&quot;

that you have a sick, fat ego that thinks it is the center of the
Universe, and thinks that it is too big and too good to need God.
<li>
They will tell you that any disagreement you have with A.A. or the
program just proves how sick you are.
<li>
<a href="orange-letters.html#Bernie" target="_blank">The crabby, mean-tempered old-timer</a>
who smacks the newcomers with
slogans and condescending put-downs is a regular fixture at many
meetings, and his bad-tempered misbehavior is excused as tough love.
</ul>

<p>
If you really want to see the unconditional love and acceptance
disappear fast, just try telling them the truth about A.A., Bill
Wilson's insanity, and the real cult religion roots of the Twelve Steps.
<p>

They also have contempt for you on another level: They don't think
you rate the truth, so they won't tell you the truth.
Their attitude is
<font color="#4f007f">

<p> 
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge
of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason
had brought
us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and

be to quit drinking, not to lose our minds, remember?
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>(And what the heck is &quot;the Bridge of Reason&quot;?)</i>

<p>
And then, finally,

Yes, Mr. Wilson was really big on blind faith.
Bill felt that being intelligent and thinking logically
was a serious impediment to success in his program:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... we agnostics and atheists chose to believe

<p>
<a name="logic_great"> </a>
Here, Bill Wilson first praised logic, to get you agreeing with him,
and then he turned around and attacked logic and declared that his
&quot;present faith&quot; was superior to logic. Bait and Switch:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Logic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not by
chance we were given the power to reason, to examine the evidence
of our senses, and to draw conclusions. That is one of man's
magnificent attributes. We agnostically inclined would not feel
satisfied with a proposal which does not lend itself to reasonable
approach and interpretation. Hence we are at pains to tell why
we think our present faith is reasonable, why we think it more
sane and logical to believe, why we say our former thinking was
soft and mushy when we threw up our hands in doubt and said,
&quot;We don't know.&quot;<br></font>

<p>
(By the way,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was
never an agnostic or an atheist</a>.
He was just putting on airs again when he wrote that, pretending to be
a reformed hard-core atheist because it sounded good.)
<p>
Bill continued his sermon:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
Chapter Seven</a> of the <i>Big Book</i> is a training manual for
recruiters. That chapter teaches another bait-and-switch
trick: first, the bait offered to the prospective new member
(&quot;prospect&quot;) is a promise of complete religious
freedom,
and then the switch comes later, when the new member finds that
he must accept the A.A. beliefs and

<p>
Why stress <i>&quot;the spiritual feature&quot;</i> freely? Because you
aren't supposed to stress

Keep on yammering,

&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">It's spiritual, not religious</a>&quot;

<p>

The statements:
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;make it emphatic that he does not have to agree with

</font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;Don't raise such issues&quot;</i></b>
</font>
are instructing the recruiter to deceive the prospect, to hide the
intense religiosity of Alcoholics Anonymous from him.
In the end, the prospect will have to agree with A.A. about God.
It is impossible to work the Twelve Steps without believing in
the A.A. version of God. But newcomers are not told that up front.

<p>
Bill Wilson declared that non-believers were &quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudiced</a>&quot;
and &quot;confused&quot; about theological terms. He didn't
tell the recruiter what to do with an intelligent well-educated
agnostic prospect who was not at all confused about what those
theological terms mean.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Or, for that matter, what do you do with an intelligent well-educated
<b><i>believer</i></b> who won't buy Bill Wilson's funny
religious opinions?
I'm sure that even the Pope would disagree with a lot of Bill's theology, because
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">it's basically heretical nonsense</a>, and at odds
with Christianity.
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban" target="_blank">The Vatican banned
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult religion</a>, from which Bill Wilson got all
of his theology, twice.
</font>

<p>
Again, Wilson taught the missionaries not to alarm prospects by revealing the
real religious agenda of Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the
spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them.
At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font>
is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
So the <i>real purpose</i> of Alcoholics Anonymous is to get people to
<i>Seek and Do the Will of God</i>.
Quitting drinking seems to be a secondary goal.
But they don't tell new recruits about that in the beginning.
They just emphasize the need to quit drinking.

<p>
Finally, Wilson said of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Its main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself
which will solve your problem. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; [That] means, of
course, that we are going to talk about God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>We Agnostics</i>, page 45.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It may be nit-picking, but it does not say that the goal is to help you
to quit drinking. The goal is to get you to:
<ul>
<li> believe in a Higher Power, <b>&quot;that Power, which is God&quot;,</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>We Agnostics</i>, page 46)</font>,
<li> and to get you to follow the dictates of that Higher Power,
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>Working With Others</i>, page 100)</font>,
<li> Who will then supposedly solve all of your problems for you.
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, pages 42 and 63)</font>.
<li> And remember, <b>&quot;Our real purpose is to fit ourselves
to be of maximum service to God...&quot;</b>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>Into Action</i>, page 77.)</font>
<li> Also remember that we must be humble, and &quot;<b>That basic
ingredient
of all humility [is] a desire to seek and do God's will.</b>&quot;

<blockquote>

<p>
So, you can have any religious beliefs you want, but if you are
an atheist, an agnostic, a skeptic, or prefer to think for yourself
while using a little common sense,
then Dr. Bob really feels sorry for you, because you are in
big trouble...

<p>
Dr. Bob says that you are guilty of &quot;intellectual pride&quot;
if you don't accept what he and Bill are pushing.
That's rather narrow-minded, isn't it?
What happened to the freedom of religion?
<p>
<ul>
<li> What, are you guilty of intellectual pride because you choose
to trust your own thinking, rather than that of a bunch of
superstitious,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#unscientific_doctors" target="_blank">anti-intellectual</a>,
people who meet in a church basement down the street?
Do you really think your own brain is working better than
the brains of
a whole bunch of fervent believers who swear that they can
use a doorknob, a teddy-bear, a motorcycle, or a group of drunks
for their God?
Gee, how stubborn, proud, and uncooperative of you.
Why don't you be a good kid, and conform, like everybody else?
<p>
<li> Or are you guilty of intellectual pride because you refuse
to submit to
religious conversion at the hands of some grinning strangers and
double-talking religiomaniacs who say that you should
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">discard
human intelligence and Reason</a>, and just have
faith in what they say?
<p>
<a name="Bill_Bob_team"> </a>
<li> Or are you guilty of intellectual pride if you think
your brain works better, and you are smarter and saner,
and a little more clear-headed, than the Bill and Bob team?
<font color="blue">
I'm guilty of that, because I know
that I'm smarter and saner than either William G. Wilson or
Dr. Robert H. Smith was.
That's really easy to do, because:<br></font>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Bill Wilson was a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">genuine,
certifiable, mental case</a>, somebody who suffered from delusions
of grandeur and chronic clinical depression, and a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic
personality disorder</a>, too. Oh, and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#brain_damage" target="_blank">Dr. Silkworth said</a> that
Bill Wilson was showing signs of alcohol-induced brain damage,
and that he feared for Bill Wilson's sanity if Bill drank any more.
Bill drank some more.
<p>
<li> And poor Doctor Bob wasn't much better off. He was a
dogmatic religious fanatic who got his kicks by
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender2Bob1" target="_blank">having
people surrender to God on their knees before him</a>,
but who had to be
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#wilson_income" target="_blank">supported by an A.A.
hand-out</a> for the rest of his life, even though he was a doctor,
still practicing medicine (supposedly).
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Ask yourself, &quot;What kind of a doctor has to be supported with
a charitable hand-out?&quot;
</font>
<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
Doctor Bob was such a crazy autocratic old fool and bad judge of character
that he forced A.A. Number Four &#8212; the constantly-relapsing 31-year-old womanizer Ernie
Galbraith &#8212; 
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Galbraith" target="_blank">on his 17-year-old daughter Susan</a>
in order to break up her romance
with her high-school sweet-heart Ray Windows, and then Doctor Bob bitterly complained that
Ernie had &quot;double-crossed&quot; him by seducing
Susan.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
<p>
And Doctor Bob was
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Susans_quotes" target="_blank">a tyranical father and a cruel child abuser</a>.
</ul>

<p>
All of which means that the A.A. true believers are basing
their lives on the preaching of two pathetic wrecks who were so
tragically brain-damaged and crazy from alcohol that they were
incapable of even
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#unemployed" target="_blank">supporting themselves</a>,
but who arrogantly presumed to be qualified to tell everybody else how to live.

<p>
And if you won't accept what those two nut-cases are preaching, then 'Doctor Bob'
says that he feels sorry for you because you are guilty of <i>&quot;intellectual pride&quot;</i>...

<p>
So what makes <i>you</i> guilty of intellectual pride?
Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>
<br>
More religious freedom, more of that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous requires no beliefs&quot;</font> stuff:
William Wilson wrote, in <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
about Step Eleven:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those of us who have come to make regular use of
prayer would no more do without it than we would
refuse air, food, or sunshine. And for the same reason. When we
refuse air, food, or sunshine, the body suffers. And when we
turn away from meditation and prayer, we likewise deprive
our minds, our emotions, and our intuitions of vitally needed
support. As the body can fail its purpose for lack of nourishment,
so can the soul. We all need the light of God's reality, the
nourishment of His strength, and the atmosphere of His grace.
To an amazing extent the facts of A.A. life confirm this ageless
truth.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 97-98.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Contrast that intensely religious statement with the earlier
statements about how
you can have any religious beliefs you wish, or none at all,
and you can have any Higher Power you wish, including a doorknob,
a motorcycle, or the A.A. group itself...
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous requires no beliefs.&quot;</i></b><br>
</font>

Yeh, right.
<p>

Obviously, one belief that is required is the belief
that it is okay, even moral,
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_dishonesty" target="_blank">to hide the truth</a>
and <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceive newcomers</a>,
doling out the truth to them
&quot;<a href="#teaspoons">by teaspoons, not buckets</a>&quot;,
while hypocritically claiming that A.A. is a program of
<i>&quot;rigorous honesty&quot;</i>.
(The end justifies the means.)

<p>
Bait and switch again: Offer them help in quitting drinking,
but give them <i>Intro to Cult Religion 101</i>. Don't bother
teaching them any good strategies or techniques for really quitting drinking and
staying quit;
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">
God will solve that problem</a>, later, or so the theory
goes. (Or maybe God won't, if God doesn't like you... Or if you &quot;hold something back&quot; in
your Fifth Step.)

<p>
And if you have made the A.A. group itself your &quot;God&quot; (G.O.D. =
<b>G</b>roup <b>O</b>f <b>D</b>runks, remember?), then just how do you get
<font color="#4f007f">

<p>
That's yet another bait and switch stunt:<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> First, they will tell you that &quot;god&quot; isn't meant
literally &#8212; it's just an expression &#8212; it can mean anything
you wish. You can even be an atheist, they say.
Anything can be your &quot;higher power&quot;.
<p>
<li> Only later will they reveal the truth: &quot;God&quot; is meant
quite literally &#8212; it is the authoritarian, micro-managing,
order-dictating, slave-driving, wish-granting, prayer-answering, defect-removing,
radiogram-transmitting, <i>Guidance</i>-sending father-figure patriarchal dictatorial fascist

<p>
This one is a back-and-forth flip-flop.
Members are alternately exhorted to read the teachings literally and follow the instructions exactly,
and then to accept vague grandiose euphemisms as sage advice and wise counseling for an improved lifestyle.
<p>
Alternatively, first, new recruits are told that the words can mean whatever they want them to mean,
then they are told that they must believe <i>literally</i>.

<p>
Bill Wilson loved to brag that &quot;God&quot; can be whatever you wish:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... &nbsp; I resisted the thought of a Czar of the Heavens, however loving
His sway might be. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said,
<i>&quot;Why don't you choose your own conception of God?&quot;</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That statement hit me hard. It melted the icy intellectual mountain in
whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years.  I stood in the
sunlight at last.<br>

Bill Wilson's life.
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">Bill Wilson was a superstitious flunk-out</a>, not an intellectual.)

<p>
But then A.A. slogans and literature declare:
<ul>
<li> &quot;Read your Big Book every day, but try reading only the black parts.&quot;
<li> &quot;Want a new life? Read it! Read the black bits, don't put anything into
the white bits and find a freedom you never imagined you could have.&quot;
<li> &quot;Chapter five (Big Book) is called 'how it works', not 'why me?'.&quot;
<li> &quot;Unless each AA member follows to the best of his ability our suggested
Twelve Steps of recovery, he almost certainly signs his own death warrant. We must
obey certain principles or we die.&quot;<br>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>

<p>

<p>

That sounds very generous and open-minded (if you accept the surreptitious suggestion
 that the goal of
A.A. is really to <i>come to believe</i>, rather than to quit drinking).
But in the recruiting manual in Chapter Seven of the <i>Big Book</i>,
Wilson instructed the recruiters to tell the religious newcomers
that their own religious beliefs were inferior to those of Alcoholics Anonymous,
because their own religion had not kept them from drinking:

<p>
<a name="believer">
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Your prospect</a> may belong to a religious denomination.
His religious education and training may be far superior to
yours. In that case he is going to wonder how you can add
anything to what he already knows. But he will be curious to
learn why his own convictions have not worked and why yours seem
to work so well. He may be an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 93.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Bill instructs the recruiter,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If someone is having troubles in his life, claim that it proves
that his religious beliefs and faith are inferior to those of
the A.A. members, because
<i>&quot;his own convictions have not worked&quot;</i>.</font>&quot;
<p>
That's a false assumption.
Who says that the purpose of all religious convictions is to
keep people from drinking alcohol?
That is not what religions are usually about.
<p>
After all, Jesus Christ drank wine, and his first miracle was making
wine out of water. Catholic priests and Jewish Rabbis drink wine
in their religious services, and many Christians drink wine during communion.
So most religious convictions don't ordinarily ban drinking.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
And religious convictions don't &quot;work&quot;.<br>
</font>
That is, religious convictions are beliefs, like the belief that Jesus Christ was
a great guy, worthy of emulation. Religious convictions are not like cars or computers,
machines which are supposed to work in a certain manner.
So religious convictions are not necessarily supposed to either make
you drink or keep you from drinking.

<p>
Note the use of broken logic:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;He may be an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.&quot;</i><br></font>
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>He <i>may</i> be an example of one of Bill Wilson's <i>unquestionably-true</i>
religious beliefs.</b><br></font>
You get a vague suggestion followed by an absolute certainty.
<p>
That's the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assume the major premise</a>&quot; &#8212;
just assume that your favorite belief is true without any proof.<br>
It's also the propaganda technique called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;my crazy delusions <i>may</i> be true... You never know... (So let's assume that
they are all true.)&quot;</font>
<p>
The phrase
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;the truth that faith alone is insufficient&quot;</i>
</font>
really has a more sinister meaning:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Just believing in my God and my religion isn't good enough.
You must also go recruit some more members for our 'little fellowship'
if you wish to avoid death by alcohol.&quot;

The A.A. recruiter is not necessarily any shining example of success.
His <i>&quot;convictions&quot;</i> are not necessarily <i>&quot;working

at least 95 percent, perhaps

Most of the recruiters will eventually
relapse and go back to being a drunk with the rest of them,
<ul>
<li> just like Bill Wilson's recruiter

Bill Wilson's first recruit in New York City,

<li> and just like

<li> and just like Paddy K., the founder of A.A. in Boston, did in <i>Alcoholics

<li> and just like how &quot;<a href="#Appleseed">Johnny Appleseed</a>&quot;,

<li> and just like

<li> and just like

Doctor Bob's son-in-law Ernie Galbraith</a>,
&quot;A.A. Number Four&quot; and author of the <i>Big Book</i> first edition

<li> and just like how
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Lillian_Roth" target="_blank">Lillian Roth</a>,
the famous child movie star and founder of A.A. in New Zealand, did.
</ul>

<p>
In fact,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#ftnt08" target="_blank">
Dick B. reports</a> that very few of Bill Wilson's original New York
group of alcoholics maintained sobriety.
And Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary, reported that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">fully 50%
of the original <i>Big Book</i> authors returned to drinking</a>.
<p>
So there is probably nothing wrong with the newcomer's religious
convictions:
<p>
<a name="Paddy"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Boston group provided us with a fresh wonder and a big
heartbreak, too. Its founder could never get sober himself
and he finally died of alcoholism. Paddy was just too sick to
make it. Slip followed slip, but he came back each time to carry
A.A.'s message, at which he was amazingly successful. Time after
time the group nursed him back to life. Then came the last bender,
and that was it. This very sick man left behind him a great
group and a triple-A rating for valor. His first two successes,
Bert C. and Jennie B., carry on to this day.<br></font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 96.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You have to question the sanity of a man who so fervently converts
others to a religious program that isn't working for him, and
isn't saving his own life.
And notice how Wilson writes so fondly about Paddy, almost declaring
him a saint of the Church for having made so many converts.
It sounds just like the medieval Christian church, bragging about
some guy who was declared a saint just because he
converted large numbers of heathen natives to belief in
the Church in Rome.

<p>
<a name="Appleseed"> </a>
That wasn't the only example of that either. In the biography of
Marty Mann, the self-appointed A.A. missionary, we read:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA was already established in South Africa when Marty arrived,
with a ready pool of interested and willing citizens. It had been
started in that country by a relapsing alcoholic,
&quot;Johnny Appleseed.&quot;
He was a gifted businessman and highly successful proponent of AA,
but he could not stay sober. Regardless, wherever he traveled and
got drunk and sobered up, he left literature about AA.<br>
</font>
<i>A Biography of Mrs. Marty Mann: The First Lady of Alcoholics
Anonymous</i>, Sally Brown and David R. Brown, page 224.
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, we have to ask what is going on here. Is the goal to stop drinking,
or is the goal to grow the church?
<p>
I know that the standard rationalization is that spreading the word,
or &quot;carrying the message&quot;, as they call it, is supposed to
help others to overcome alcoholism, but how can someone so fervently
believe in a program and seek to convert others to it when it isn't
actually working to help him avoid death by alcohol?
What word is there to spread?
How can people be so convinced that it is a great
program for others when it isn't working for them? (And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">when it isn't really
working for anybody</a>?)
<p>
Is that religious faith or obstinate superstition?
<p>
<font color="blue">
It reminds me of a guy who says,
</font>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I know of a great solution to all of our economic problems.
It's called Communism. It hasn't gotten me any more money yet, personally,
but I know that it's a great program.
So let's spread it around everywhere, and take over the whole world.

Continuing with the game of religious one-upmanship,

So you should dump your current religion and just believe in
the teachings of Bill Wilson so that you can get the
Alcoholics Anonymous style of &quot;spirituality&quot;.
<p>

<p>
All of those back-stabbing games of religious one-upmanship
make a lie of the happy P.R. statement that Bill Wilson wrote
in the beginning of the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have no desire to convince anyone that there is only one way

<p>
It is grossly unethical to demand religious conversion from the patients
of a program that is ostensibly supposed to be some kind of 
&quot;treatment&quot; for a medical condition like alcoholism or drug
addiction &#8212; especially when the demands for conversion only become
apparent in the middle of the program.
It is like a doctor who has a patient cut open on the operating table suddenly
saying to the patient,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you want this operation to turn out okay, you should convert
to my religion right now. But please don't think that I am forcing you
 &#8212; This isn't blackmail &#8212; I'm giving you complete freedom of religion
 &#8212; You can believe anything you want &#8212; But I really do believe that you
will get the best results from this operation &#8212; you will have the best

The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get

Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
How many times have we

We seem to be contemplating a paradox.
A religious movement which begins by ignoring all existing systems, and
claims to have none of its own, ends by becoming a system more despotic
than any! In order to 'check' the marching orders from on high which the
Groupist has been taught to count upon, and which in fact he claims to
have received,
the movement has found itself forced to create a 'checking' machinery
which robs the Groupist of his private judgement, and binds him to an
unquestioning obedience to the verdicts of another authority than that
of the 'luminous thought' which he was originally required to look on
as Divine!<br>

First, it's <i>&quot;any God as you understand Him&quot;</i>, and then it's
<i>&quot;You don't understand God. You are 'confused' and 'prejudiced'.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
In Step Three, you are instructed to believe in &quot;God <i>as we
understood Him</i>,&quot; but it will gradually become apparent that
A.A. considers your primitive understanding of God to be just
plain wrong.
<p>
Watch the wording: It's
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God as <i><b>we</b></i> understood <i>Him</i>&quot;</font>,
not
<font color="blue">
&quot;God as <i><b>you</b></i> understand <i>Her</i>&quot;</font>.

care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</font>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That step implies that God can be anything that you understand It
to be, but that step ends with the word &quot;Him&quot;, and implies that
It is a God Who can and shall take over the care of your will and
your life for you. (&#8212;As well as It being a God who actually wishes to be bothered
with doing the work that you should be doing for yourself. There is plenty of
theological room to argue that you should be learning to take proper
care of yourself, not begging God to take care of you.)

<p>
In addition,
Step Eleven itself pretty strongly implies that we don't know God
 &#8212; we aren't in good &quot;conscious contact&quot; with God &#8212; 
and we need further
enlightenment and knowledge about God, and power from God, which we
will get by practicing <i>Channelling</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>Step Eleven: Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious

</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(And when the prayer didn't work,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Ouija" target="_blank">Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob
used a Ouija board</a> to get their messages from &quot;the spirits&quot;. Is that really
the kind of religion that you wish to join?)
</font>

<p>
A.A. thinks that you need a lot of religious re-education.
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">You are just
a stupid beginner who can't think properly</a>
&#8212; your brain has been damaged by alcohol &#8212; so it doesn't matter what
your sick mind thinks right now. They will fix you. You can start off with any
religious convictions you wish; they will soon be dumped into the trash can and
you will be taught what you should <i>really</i> believe.
<p>
Bill Wilson routinely declared that people who disagreed with his
radical religious beliefs were &quot;confused&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudiced</a>&quot;,
and Bill instructed recruiters to avoid discussing
religious issues with new prospective recruits:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
<a name="believe_group"> </a>
Bill Wilson declared that newcomers could start off with various diverse
religious beliefs, but then they were gradually
pressured and nudged towards the standard A.A. beliefs:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I must quickly assure you that A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest
for faith. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your 'higher power.'
Here's a very large group who have solved their alcohol problem.
In this respect they are certainly a power greater than you, who have not even
come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in them. Even this
minimum of faith will be enough. You will find many members who have
crossed the threshold just this way. All of them will tell you that,
once across, their faith broadened and deepened. Relieved of the
alcohol obsession, their lives unaccountably transformed, they came to
believe in a Higher Power, and most of them began to talk of God.&quot;<br>

<p>
The original goal of the Alcoholics Anonymous program was ostensibly
to quit drinking, but it got changed into a
<font color="#9F0000"><i>&quot;quest for faith&quot;</i></font>
 &#8212; a need to <font color="#9F0000"><i>&quot;cross the threshold&quot;</i></font>
and start believing in Bill Wilson's &quot;Higher Power&quot; or &quot;God&quot;.
&nbsp; Bait and Switch.
<p>
Bill Wilson wrote repeatedly in the <i>Big Book</i> and <i>Twelve
Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> that beginners needed to be
re-educated and converted to believing in God, as
Bill Wilson understood Him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had
restored us to sanity and had enabled us
to live with some peace of mind in a sorely
troubled world, then <font color="#9F0000"><b>such a Higher Power
was worth knowing better, by as
direct contact as possible.</b></font> The persistent use of
meditation and prayer, we found, did open the channel so
that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river
which led to sure power and safe guidance from
<font color="#9F0000"><b>God as we were
increasingly better able to understand Him</b></font>.<br>
<a name="group_power"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question. Looking at those who were
only beginning and still doubting themselves,
<font color="#9F0000"><b>the rest of us were
able to see the change setting in.</b></font>
From great numbers of such experiences, <font color="#9F0000"><b>we could
predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.</b></font><br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 108-109.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God as <i><b>you</i></b> understood Him&quot;</font>
got changed into
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;God as <i><b>we</b></i> were
increasingly better able to understand Him&quot;.
</font>
<p>
No matter what you believe to start with, you will end up loving
the A.A. God and calling Him by name at A.A. meetings
while the old-timers beam with pride at their handiwork.

<table width="93%" border="3" cellpadding="25" cellspacing="0" align="center">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

And while the old-timers will be able to see the change setting in,
the newcomer won't.
Bill Wilson quite plainly stated that the indoctrination and
brainwashing take effect without the victim's knowledge or permission.
That's the standard brain-washing practice of
&quot;<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">Keep them unaware
of how they are being changed</a>.&quot;
<p>

Likewise, Bill also wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Quite often friends of the newcomer
are aware of the difference long before he is himself.
He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in
his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been
brought about by himself alone. What often takes place in a few
months could seldom have been accomplished by years of
self-discipline.<br>

A.A. initially says
that you are free to have any religious

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> has an entire chapter, named
&quot;We Agnostics&quot;, that is devoted to just one subject:
declaring how and why all agnostics and atheists
must be converted into true believers.
(It doesn't tell you anything about how to quit drinking.)
Bill Wilson starts off sounding very broad-minded and tolerant
of other religious beliefs, but is soon playing hard-ball:

sneering at those people who disagree with his fundamentalist religious beliefs, using

<p>
<font color="blue">
So just what on Earth are
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;intelligent agents, spearheads of God's ever advancing Creation&quot;</i></font>?
<p>
Whatever they are, Bill Wilson thinks he's one of them.
Bill's <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">delusions
of grandeur and messianic complex</a> are striking again.
<p>
And Bill imagines that his &quot;faith&quot; is &quot;logical&quot;:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about.&quot;<br></font>
No, actually, they don't. They have dogmatic ideas. They are told what to believe, no matter
what the evidence before them may be. That isn't logical at all. Logic is a thought process
where you examine facts and evidence and then draw conclusions from it, often using
deductive or inductive reasoning.
</font>

<p>
In that <i>We Agnostics</i> chapter, Wilson made more grand claims that
would strip away our freedom of religion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When we became alcoholics, crushed by a self-imposed crisis we could not
postpone or evade, we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God
is everything or else He is nothing. God either is, or He isn't. What was

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Talk about absolute black and white thinking... Bill Wilson gives you a choice of either agreeing

it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that Power,

<p>
Such vague, grandiose hand-waving is typical of Bill Wilson's
writing, and is evidence of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">his delusional

give you accurate information about alcoholism and recovery;
he wants to deceive you into believing what he is preaching.

Note how Mr. Wilson repeatedly used the word
<b>&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">prejudice</a>&quot;</b>
to describe reluctance to accept his
fuzzy thinking, broken logic, and Buchmanite religious beliefs:
<ul>
<li> You are <i>prejudiced</i> if you won't accept Bill Wilson's preaching on faith alone.
<li> You are <i>prejudiced</i> if you demand clear thinking and honest talk in plain English.
<li> You are <i>prejudiced</i> if you object to Bill Wilson's grandiose euphemisms and undefined terminology.
<li> You are <i>prejudiced</i> if you have different religious beliefs than Bill Wilson.

That <i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i> chapter of the <i>Big Book</i>
clearly describes how that same <i>&quot;religious freedom to religious
conformity&quot;</i> bait-and-switch stunt was pulled on the original
members of A.A., half of whom were non-believers who only joined
because they wanted to escape from death by alcoholism,
but who were eventually forced through an unwanted religious
conversion, and made to believe the same things as Bill Wilson:

<p>
<a name="only_spiritual_experience"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit
entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the
amount you take, you are probably alcoholic. If that be the
case, you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual
experience will conquer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To one who feels he is an atheist or agnostic such an experience
seems impossible, but to continue as he is means disaster,
especially if he is an alcoholic of the hopeless variety. To be
doomed to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are
not always easy alternatives to face.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But it isn't so difficult.
<font color="blue">
About half our original fellowship
were of exactly that type.</font>
At first some of us tried to avoid the
issue, hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after
a while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual
basis of life &#8212; or else. Perhaps it is going to be that way with
you.
<font color="blue">
But cheer up, something like half of us thought we were
atheists or agnostics.</font>
Our experience shows that you need not be
disconcerted. &nbsp; ... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a power by
which we could live, and it had to be a Power greater than
ourselves. Obviously. But where and how were we to find this
Power?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Well, that's exactly what this book is about. Its main object is
to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself which will
solve your problem. <br>

<p>
Note the illogical progression:
<ul>
<li> First,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;you
<font color="#9F0000">
may</font> be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual
experience will conquer.&quot;
</font>
There is
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">no such illness</a>,
outside of Mr. Wilson's imagination.
Neither the American Medical Association, nor the American
Psychiatric Association recognize the existence of any disease or
illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.
<p>
<li> Then Wilson declares
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;you are
<font color="#9F0000">
doomed</font>
to an alcoholic death, or to live on a
spiritual basis&quot;
</font>
(whatever that means), and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;we
<font color="#9F0000">
must</font>
find a spiritual basis of life &#8212;
<font color="#9F0000">
or else</font>.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<li>
Wilson's mind jumps from
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>you may be sick</b>&quot;
</font>
to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>you will die</b> if you don't live on my spiritual basis&quot;
</font>
without a single supporting fact, or any
new facts at all, to support his sudden change of the medical diagnosis.
Bait and switch.
</ul>
<p>

<b>But you need not be <i>&quot;disconcerted&quot;</i></b> &#8212;
Bill said that such forced religious conversions
had already been done to half of the A.A. members, who only
&quot;<i><b>thought</b></i> that they were atheists or agnostics&quot;,
but who learned differently after Bill Wilson and his henchmen played
mind games on them for a while.<br>

How does facing the fact that you are an alcoholic
suddenly make it impossible for you to
also be an agnostic or an atheist?<br>

<font color="blue">
Bill says it is because you must have a &quot;spiritual experience&quot;,
or your &quot;illness&quot; won't be &quot;conquered&quot;.
Where is the evidence for that? There is none.
</font>
<p>

<li> Just how did those alcoholic members discover that they had to
&quot;find a spiritual basis of life, or else&quot;?
<ul>
<li> Were some experiments done, to see whether A.A. religious believers
relapsed less often than non-believers?
<font color="blue">No.</font>
<li> Did Bill Wilson have any valid, reliable evidence that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">believing in Wilsonism
saved people from alcoholism</a>?
<font color="blue">No.</font>
<li> Did
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank">Wilson's organization</a>
have a higher success rate than any of the
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery" target="_blank">other
temperance movements</a> that had come before it?
<font color="blue">No.</font>
<li> Did Bill Wilson's group of alcoholics have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">a greater recovery rate</a>
than other alcoholics who got none of his cult religion indoctrination?
<font color="blue">No.</font>

<li> Bill said that &quot;we&quot; just &quot;had to face the fact that
we must find a spiritual basis of life, or else&quot; based on no
particular evidence at all.
And by implication, you must do the same thing with your life,
also based on no evidence at all.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Bill is pulling the propaganda stunt called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank">
<i>petitio principii</i></a> &#8212; assume facts not in evidence;
assume the very thing that you are trying to prove.
Bill just assumes that his &quot;spiritual program&quot; is
of course the only cure for alcoholism,
so all of the &quot;true alcoholics&quot;
must start living his way immediately, or else.

<p>
<li>
And the &quot;or else&quot; threat uses two more propaganda techniques:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">The Either/Or technique</a>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">Argue from
Adverse Consequences &#8212; Fear Mongering</a>
</ol>

<p>
<li> And note how Wilson is pulling a slick trick with the
language. He says that all alcoholics &quot;must find a
spiritual basis of life &#8212; or else&quot;, but then Bill Wilson is
the one who gets
to define just what a &quot;spiritual basis&quot; is...
And <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill's ideas of
&quot;spirituality&quot;</a> turn out to be pretty goofy.

To Wilson, research wasn't necessary; religion was The Answer.

<p>
Indeed. Bill Wilson was not trying to find the cure for alcoholism.
He was sure that he already had it. The only problem he saw was getting everybody
else to agree with him.
<p>
That is a common problem that narcissists have &#8212; they
believe that they are
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#narcissists_qualified" target="_blank">more qualified
than everyone else</a> for solving problems, even when they have no education or

Bill thought that he was qualified to replace both priests and alcoholism

Did you notice the very first sleight-of-hand trick?
That was yet another bait and switch stunt:
<ul>
<li>
In Step Two, we only had to believe in a nice, vague, &quot;Higher
Power&quot; &#8212; any <i>&quot;Power greater than ourselves&quot;</i>
who would help us by restoring us to sanity.
<li>
But in Step Three, it suddenly became &quot;God as we understood Him.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.</b><br>
<b>3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Who changed the terminology?
Who brought in that capitalized three-letter word, &quot;God&quot;,
with all of Its emotional baggage and associations?
<p>
Some believers say that the &quot;God&quot; word means the same thing as
&quot;your Higher Power, however you envision or understand It,&quot;
that the &quot;God&quot; word is just a convenient short-hand.
They will even tell you that you can make the word &quot;God&quot; mean
&quot;Good Orderly Direction&quot; or
&quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;, if you like.
<p>
I'm not buying that argument for a minute.
If we had a political contract where in Step 2 you were
supposed to get the help of &quot;the Constitutionally-elected
President&quot;, and then in Step 3 you were supposed to follow the
orders of &quot;der F&uuml;hrer&quot;, would you believe that nothing
was changed by the substitution of that word?
Would you believe that it was just a short-hand, and still meant
just the same thing? I don't think so.
<p>
And this &quot;God as we understood Him&quot; turns out to be God as
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>,
William Griffith Wilson, and Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith understood Him: a vindictive,
authoritarian, micro-managing, willful Old-Testament patriarchal male
God Who dictates orders to His sycophant followers, and Who looks an
awful lot like Charlton Heston playing Moses, or that Bearded Fellow
Whom Michaelangelo painted on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.
<p>
And, according to Bill Wilson, that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#daily_vision" target="_blank">&quot;God&quot;
is so mean-spirited</a> that He will torture you to death &#8212;
make you die slowly
from alcohol poisoning &#8212; if you fail to grovel before Him and follow
his orders <i>every day</i>.<br>
(And if you don't believe in a God like that, then the rest of the
<i>Big Book</i> doesn't make much sense. Neither do the Twelve Steps.
The Twelve Steps cannot possibly work without there being such a
meddling God pulling puppet strings,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles" target="_blank">delivering miracles on demand</a>,
changing reality to suit the A.A. members.)

<p><br>
Bill Wilson pulled that same bait-and-switch trick in this
convoluted sentence:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We found that as soon as we were able to lay
aside prejudice and express even a willingness to
believe in a Power greater than ourselves, we
commenced to get results, even though it was
impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend
that Power, which is God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, Page 46.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Excuse me? Say what? It's a nice, vague, tolerant, loosely-defined,
open-minded
&quot;Power greater than ourselves&quot;
in the middle of that sentence, but It gets
changed into just plain old &quot;<b>God</b>&quot; at the end of
the sentence &#8212; &quot;God&quot;, without even one of the
&quot;as we understood Him&quot; qualifiers...
<p>
Bill Wilson plays a slick shell game &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The hand is quicker than the eye.
Where did the free thought and open-mindedness go?&quot;</i></font>
Bill's stunt was accomplished by adding <b>just three words</b>
to the tail end of that sentence:<br>
<center>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;<b>which is God.</b>&quot;<br>
</font>
</center>
<p>
Up until then, Bill was talking about a nice, loose,
define-it-yourself Higher Power,
one that would be acceptable to just about any old religion or philosophy,
and then, suddenly,
<i>wham!</i> It became the God of Bill Wilson's understanding.
That's a classic bait-and-switch stunt, accomplished by redefining
the object of the sentence at the last possible instant.

<p>
<a name="one_true_God"> </a>
After that, the old-timers will set to work indoctrinating
the newcomers, pressuring them to bring their beliefs
into agreement with the standard A.A. theology, pressuring them to
conform to the group.
A popular book called the <i>&quot;Serenity Bible&quot;</i> describes
that theistic bait-and-switch process precisely:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We may start out as agnostics. We may then come to view the group
or recovery process as our higher power, looking to other
people for strength. Gradually, we accept a vague notion of god,
which grows to a more specific monotheistic god.
We may even begin to pray to and dialogue with this god.
Eventually we come to know the one true God.<br>

<p>

So you can start off with any religious opinions you wish, but you will
be constantly pressured and nudged towards belief in &quot;the one
true God&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous, until you believe just
what they believe.
(Much of that process is just the usual social pressure to conform to
whatever group you are in. It is almost unavoidable.)

<p>
An A.A. member likewise clearly described the indoctrination process
that made him <i>&quot;come to believe&quot;</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When I got sober I initially had faith only in the program
of Alcoholics Anonymous. Desperation and fear kept me sober
(and maybe a caring and/or tough sponsor helped!). Faith in
a Higher Power came much later.
This faith came slowly at first, after I began listening to
others share at meetings about their experiences &#8212; experiences
that I had never faced sober, but that they were facing with
strength from a Higher Power. Out of their sharing came hope
that I too would &#8212; and could &#8212; &quot;get&quot; a Higher Power.
In time, I learned that a Higher Power &#8212; a faith that works
under all conditions &#8212; is possible.<br>

<p>
And we get the same religious conversion story from Al-Anon, the wives' auxiliary of Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I turned my back on religion many years before my first Al-Anon meeting, so when the
meeting ended with a closing prayer, I wondered how I could pray without feeling false.
I closed my eyes and bowed my head, but I didn't say the prayer.
I feared someone would tap me on the shoulder and tell me to say the prayer.
The prayer ended, and no one chastised me. Instead, I was given literature and encouraged
to return. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Years after my first meeting, I stand gratefully in the circle and <i>choose</i> to say
the closing prayer.<br>

<br><font size="+2">
<li> <b><i>Bait and Switch:</i></b> 
Redefine God. First you get one God, then you get a different God.

<p>
Step Two says that we only have to believe that a &quot;Power
greater than yourself&quot; &#8212; which can be anything, they proudly declare,
including a doorknob, a potato, a mountain, a motorcycle, a cat, a parakeet, or the A.A.
group itself &#8212; will &quot;restore us to sanity.&quot;
<p>
In Step Three, we only need to believe in
&quot;God as we understand Him,&quot; &#8212;  we supposedly have great freedom in
defining our &quot;God&quot;, so that the program can accommodate
all religions and all faiths.
<p>
But the subsequent steps become
increasingly specific about just Who and What God is, until by
Step Twelve, A.A. has precisely defined their version of God.
And the following steps instruct you to do things that require
a very specific kind of God:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> If you point out that it is unChristian and heretical to believe in a Golden Calf as your Higher Power,
the sponsors will tell you that you can't really believe in a Golden Calf &#8212; that the
&quot;anything as God&quot; line is just something that they tell the newcomers who might object
to a dogmatic religion. Later, the newcomers learn that there is really only one acceptable
Higher Power, and It is the entity that Bill Wilson called &quot;God&quot;.

<p><li> You must believe that God can (and will) control your alcoholism
and manage your life (Step One). So it has to be some kind of meddling,
micro-managing God who actually wants to meddle and micro-manage.
<p><li> You must believe that God can (and will) restore you to sanity
(Step Two). Again, God must be a meddler who actually wants to poke
around inside your head.
<p><li> You must turn your will and your life over to the care of God
(Step Three). So It must be a God Who can and will take care of your
life and your will for you. And it must also be a God who wants to do that.<br>
<font color="blue">
(And, according to the theology of Bill Wilson,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#prayer3" target="_blank">this is where you offer
to become a slave of God</a>,
and you tell God that it is in His own self-interest to
fix whatever is wrong with you,
so that He will have a better slave grovelling before Him. And that will also
make God look like a better slave-master, too.)
</font>

<p><li> You must confess all of your wrongs, defects of character, and
moral shortcomings to God (Step Five). So It must be a God Who will
listen, and maybe actually give a damn about your petty-ass sins.
 &#8212; And, presumably, grant you absolution.
<p><li> You must pray to God for a number of things, like:
<ul>
<li> the miraculous removal of all of your &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, including
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">your desire
to drink alcohol</a> (Step Seven),
<li> conscious contact with God (Step Eleven),
<li> knowledge of His will for us, and the power to carry out His will (Step Eleven).
</ul>
<font color="blue">
And you must believe that God will actually grant all of those wishes, as if God
were Aladdin's magical Genie who grants three wishes whenever you rub his lamp.
</font>
<p><li> You must believe that God is a Consciousness Who can be contacted by psychic
means in a s&eacute;ance. They called it <i>Seeking Guidance</i> during &quot;The Quiet Time&quot;
(Step Eleven).
<p><li> You must believe that God will give you a &quot;Spiritual Experience&quot; or
a &quot;Spiritual Awakening&quot; (Step Twelve).
<p><li> And you must believe that God really can and will manage your life for you, and
restore you to sanity, and answer all
of your prayers, and grant all of your wishes, and &quot;take care of
your will and your life&quot; for you,
even while He completely ignores the starving children
in Biafra, Bengladesh, Ethiopia, India, Sudan and Darfur, and the rest of Africa.
Apparently, the A.A. God only cares about white boozers.
</ul>
<p>
That is a very narcissistic approach to life, and it is
passive dependency to the max.
(Not to mention the fact that it is also completely unrealistic,
downright insane, and
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">very heretical to all of the world's major religions</a>.)
<p>
<a name="hear_instructions"> </a>
It is, of course, absurd nonsense to declare that you are turning
your will and your life over to the care of a doorknob, a bedpan, or a Group Of Drunks.<br>
It is ridiculous to suggest that we can do Step Eleven by sitting
quietly and waiting to hear the voice of a motorcycle or a teddy-bear
dictating our work orders for the day.<br>

their behavior is so ludicrous that the A.A. true believers seem to be

serious &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;This is not a joke, this is a matter of life or
death. You must turn your life and your will over to the care
of some Higher Power of your choosing, like a doorknob, or a potato, or a kumquat,

<p>
Just any old Higher Power or God-as-we-understand-Him
won't work for all of that any better than a doorknob will, either.
A Buddhist Higher Power who micro-manages the world, for instance, is out of the question.
So is a Native American Great Spirit.
Hindu gods don't work that way either.
Allah is out, because Moslems are forbidden to drink alcohol,
so you shouldn't have gotten into trouble in the first place.
And the Jewish <i>Yahweh</i> does not micromanage the world and
perform miracles on demand, so He's out as well.
<p>
Many Christians will have problems
with the required Higher Power, too. In fact, very few sects
believe in a God who micromanages and manipulates the entire world
and everybody in it like so many little puppets. Most Christian
sects believe that humans have free will, and can either do good,
or royally screw things up, all on their own, and that your life is what
you make it.
<p>
Few Christian sects believe in predestination, or that your future
moral life will be determined by inheriting a gene for alcoholism,
and hence, a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#childhood" target="_blank">But A.A. does</a>.
<p>
Few Christian sects believe that you can be
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">&quot;powerless&quot; over
temptation</a>, and that you can only solve that problem by
giving up, and &quot;surrendering to God&quot; and
demanding that God fight the temptation for you. 
What's the point? You aren't even really living your
own life any more, if you do that...
It's <i>&quot;God vs. The Temptations&quot;</i> at that
point, with you reduced to just being a spectator on the sidelines
of your own life.
<p>
Few Christian sects believe that you have to spend every waking minute
of every day of your life doing the dictates of God, or else He will kill you.
But A.A. does.
<p>
Few Christian sects believe in a God Who would be so cheap as to
only heal you for one day at a time when He does heal you,
to keep you always trapped under His thumb,
and having to keep coming back for more healing,
having to again and again beg for another day of
sobriety, every single day, for the rest of your life.
But A.A. believes in such a Monster of a cruel God.
<p>
So you really aren't free to believe in just any old Higher Power
you like, or just any &quot;God as you understand Him.&quot;
Like Henry Ford's joke about model-T car colors &#8212;
&quot;You can have any color you want, as long as it
is black&quot; &#8212; in A.A., you can have any God you want,
just as long as it is the A.A. God.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Note that many of the true believers will still insist that you can
have any God or Higher Power you wish. They will even brag about
members who came from other religions.

But what they are really saying is that

aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they

It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we

nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only

The recovering alcoholics, whom Bill Wilson deprecatingly called

didn't want to be good</a>&quot;,
just wanted to quit drinking. They didn't want to

indoctrinated and brainwashed enough to not quit A.A. when they found out the truth...
The A.A. slogan
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<a href="#teaspoons">Teaspoons, Not Buckets</a>&quot;</i>
</font>
teaches the standard A.A. recruiting procedure.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Don't scare away the newcomers by telling them too much
truth too soon.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
Notice how Bill Wilson claimed that the alcoholics' reluctance to join
a cult religion was them
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;clinging to their other defects&quot;</font>,
and them
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;not wanting to get too good too soon.&quot;</font>
Such arrogance.
<p>
In Bill Wilson's mind, the alcoholics had to both quit drinking and
convert to his Buchmanite religion in order to be good people.
<p>
Also note that the absurd <i>&quot;Absolutes&quot;</i> 
were not exactly restricted to
the Oxford Groups.
The terminology <i>&quot;The Four Absolutes&quot;</i> was,
but the thinking wasn't.
Most cult religions encourage irrational absolute
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#black_and_white" target="_blank">black-and-white thinking</a>
and grandiose
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_perfection" target="_blank">demands for
super-human perfection</a>.

<p>
<a name="arouse_prejudice"> </a>
And while recruiting, remember the strategy above,
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;There is no use arousing any prejudice...&quot;</b>
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There is no use arousing any prejudice he may have against certain
theological terms and conceptions about which he may already be confused.
Don't raise such issues, no matter what your own convictions are.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
(If you don't agree with Bill Wilson's version of Frank Buchman's religion,
then you are &quot;confused&quot; about theological terms.)
<p>
But wait, there's more:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Show him that as alcoholics, the writers of the [A.A.] book understand.
Tell him some of the interesting stories you have read.
If you think he will be shy of a spiritual remedy, ask him to look
at the chapter on alcoholism. Then perhaps he will be interested
enough to continue.<br></font>

<p>

Looking at those who were only beginning and still doubting themselves,
the rest of us were able to see the change setting in.

predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,

</blockquote>

<p>
So Bill's real goal, and the final result of the Twelve-Step program,
is the religious conversion of all of the newcomers. Bait and switch.

<p>
<a name="lure_the_reader"> </a>
Hiding the true nature of A.A. from the beginners
has been a standard recruiting strategy since
the very earliest days of Alcoholics Anonymous.
The A.A. history book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>
describes the debate surrounding the creation of &quot;the <i>Big Book</i>&quot;,
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, where the early
A.A. members debated about how much truth to reveal to the public and the
prospective new members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Fitz wanted a powerfully religious document; Henry and Jimmy would have none of it.
They wanted a psychological book which would
<font color="blue">lure the reader in</font>; when
he finally arrived among us, there would then be enough time to tip him
off about the spiritual character of our society. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; As umpire of these
disputes, I was obliged to go pretty much down the middle, writing in
spiritual rather than religious or entirely psychological terms.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>
(1957), William G. Wilson, page 17.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, Bill says, he compromised and downplayed the
religious nature of the organization, and only told part of the truth, in
order to &quot;lure the reader in&quot;:
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religious organization.&quot;</i></font>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;It's spiritual, not religious.&quot;</font></i>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous requires no beliefs.&quot;</i></font>.

<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
There would be time enough to reveal the true nature of A.A. to the
newcomers later on, after they had &quot;finally arrived among us...&quot;</i></font>
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
Also note how neatly Bill Wilson blamed his dishonesty and deceit
on the other A.A. members, rationalizing that he had to do what they said.
The thought of actually telling the whole truth to the newcomers
does not seem to have ever crossed Bill Wilson's mind.

None of those bait-and-switch stunts are accidental.
Frank Buchman's cult
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#conviction" target="_blank">deliberately practiced
deceptive recruiting</a> &#8212;
which is really
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">a very common cult practice</a> &#8212;
telling prospective
recruits <b><i>anything</i></b> to get them to join, and rationalizing
it by saying that the lying and deceiving was okay because it was
all done in the service of God &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We are winning more souls for God&quot;</i>
</font>
 &#8212; which is yet another standard cult belief,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_end_justifies" target="_blank">The end justifies
the means.</a>&quot;
</font>
<p>
The Buchmanites trained Bill Wilson, and he learned his lessons well.
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">A.A. is just the same.</a>
They simply add <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_end_justifies" target="_blank">two
more rationalizations</a> to the list of excuses:<br>

<ol>
<li> <i>&quot;And it's also okay because we are doing it to save the
alcoholics' lives. We are doing it to them for their own good.&quot;</i>
<p>
<li> <i>&quot;Besides, even if the Twelve Steps don't really work very well
for making people quit drinking alcohol, we are still getting
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">those disgusting alcoholics</a> praying
and seeking and doing the will of God, and that's a good thing.&quot;</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
(Also see <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#high_status_healer1" target="_blank">A.A.-Trustee Professor
George E. Vaillant's rationalization</a> for shoving all alcoholics
into Alcoholics Anonymous, even though he had proved that A.A. treatment does not work
and does not save their lives. Vaillant said it was to
make them get an &quot;attitude change&quot; by
&quot;confession of sins to a high-status healer&quot;. Later,
Vaillant also declared that &quot;Puritanical abstinence&quot; from
alcohol was not the real goal &#8212;

<br>
It turns out that such bait-and-switch practices are common in cults.
Daniel Shaw wrote of his experiences in SYDA &#8212; &quot;Siddha Yoga&quot;,
the cult of Swami Muktananda:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Social workers are taught early in their education the values of their
profession: the clients' right to self-determination, respect and dignity
for all, the innate worth of a human being, respect for uniqueness, and
the facilitation of the realization of potential (Woods and Hollis, 1990).
<p>
Religious cults are skillful in advertising the promotion of these values
as the core of their philosophy. For example, SYDA's chief
slogans, repeated frequently in public talks and SYDA Foundation literature,
are: &quot;Honor, love, respect, worship your Self. God dwells within you,
as you. See God in each other.&quot; SYDA claims that its guru is &quot;a
self-realized master,&quot; and that following the teachings of the master
leads to one's own self-realization. The bait of these messages is used
to attract members.
<p>
Once membership is established, the messages are switched to ever-increasing
demands for obedience, submission and dependence. The actual value system
of a cult is often the antithesis of the system it advertises.<br>

<a name="treatment_program"> </a><br>

<li> LAST BUT NOT LEAST: This may well be the first thing you notice:
You may have signed up for a treatment program, either voluntarily
or involuntarily. You expected to get some kind of medical treatment,
good, bad, or indifferent, but at least some kind of &quot;treatment.&quot;
<p>
Instead, you found that the program consisted of
&quot;group therapy&quot; sessions of indoctrination with xeroxed copies of
Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous training materials
by
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">a &quot;counselor&quot; who was a
religious fanatic and a true believer in A.A. or N.A., as well as a member</a>.
(It sort of sounds like the Hair Club for Men TV commercials, doesn't it:
&quot;I'm not just
<!-- a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank" -->the dogmatic true-believer
 group leader<!-- /a -->,
I'm also a member.&quot;)
Then, along with the &quot;group therapy&quot;
sessions, you were also required to go to at least three
A.A. or N.A. meetings per week, or, &quot;Preferably, one every day.&quot;
<p>
Your counselor explained to you that if you went to enough meetings,
it would all just gradually soak in. You would learn a little here,
and a little there, and eventually you would get it.
<p>
<a name="ftnt03_ret"> </a>
He wouldn't say out loud just what the <i>&quot;IT&quot;</i> was
that you were supposed to get. He might have mumbled something
about &quot;equipping you with the tools that you would need to
maintain
sobriety&quot;,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt03">3</a></sup></font>
but he wasn't very specific.

<p>
Perhaps, eventually, you figured it out. You were supposed to get
religious conversion. You were supposed to start believing what they
believe. You were supposed to start &quot;sharing&quot;
about your &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
talking about how much you enjoy praying to Him,
and how He is answering your prayers and
helping you to quit drinking, and making your life wonderful...
You were supposed to start talking about how wonderful the
Twelve Steps are, and how they are the solution to all of your
problems, and how you are making such great progress with them.
And you were supposed to speak about yourself with disgust and
loathing, and &quot;admit&quot; how sinful and stupid you have
been, and how brilliant Bill Wilson was...
<p>

It's yet another bait-and-switch stunt.
You agreed to &quot;medical treatment,&quot; not religious indoctrination.
<p>
<a name="ftnt04_ret"> </a>
Again, this is no accident, and not even a coincidence. Most of the
treatment facilities and treatment programs in this country have been
taken over by such A.A.
true believers, or their N.A. (Narcotics Anonymous)
brethren.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>
The take-over was easy &#8212; it happened almost by default.
No one else really wanted the job.
The brainy people are busy building careers in computers;
the ambitious people are all playing IPO on Wall Street;
the artistic people are busy doing their own thing,
and everybody else is doing something else.

<p>
The A.A. and N.A. members were the only ones who really wanted to
run the nation's drug and alcohol treatment centers. It's a miserable
job &#8212; the pay is low,
there is no glamor or status, it's depressing because
the vast majority of the people, almost everyone,
will fail the program and relapse,
and the counselor gets to work with all of the real wrecks and losers.
<p>
The twelve-step true believers wanted the job so that they could redirect all
of the nation's
alcoholics and drug addicts into their 12-Step religion.
It's called &quot;Twelfth Step&quot; work &#8212; recruit new members for the cult.
<p>
Offer the patients hope of recovery, but give them Twelve-Step religion.
<p>
Bait and Switch.

forbidding her to see her high-school sweetheart,
Ray Windows,
and using the older alcoholic womanizer Ernie Galbraith,

Ernie ended up grabbing Susan for himself.
It was a disastrous marriage. Ernie relapsed constantly. He even wrote
the story &quot;The Seven Month Slip&quot; for the <i>Big Book</i>,
which described a seven-month-long relapse.
He also philandered a lot,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">just like Bill Wilson</a>.
Even worse,
Ernie and Sue's daughter got pregnant at 16, and then killed herself
and her own little daughter with Ernie's shotgun a few years later,
in a double suicide-murder.
Bill Wilson quietly removed Ernie's story, <i>&quot;The Seven Month Slip&quot;</i>,
from the <i>Big Book</i> in 1955 when the second edition was published.
But Sue didn't get divorced from Ernie
until 1965. Then she finally married Ray Windows, her old

Four or five of the Ten Commandments mention God:
Which it is depends on the &quot;Honor thy mother and father&quot;
commandment.
That wording doesn't mention God.
But the original text in the Bible, in the book of Exodus, chapter
20, does. The modern translation reads: &quot;Respect your father
and your mother, and you will live a long time in the land I am
giving you.&quot; The speaker is God, so that commandment indirectly
refers to God.

This is one of the most insane and vicious books around.
It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">
hate content</a>, is concerned.
It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's
explanation of his Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, but it
is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">something quite
dark and evil</a>, Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for
human nature masquerading as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">all of his own
weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Look at him.
Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>
This whole book is non-stop guilt induction.
