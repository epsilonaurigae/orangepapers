<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>Studies have shown that today's cults use a stronger form of
control than those of 50 years ago.  The advent of new
psychological experiments in the 60's and 70's have produced the
modern methods of mind control which are far more sophisticated
than the BEHAVIOUR MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES and THOUGHT REFORM
developed by the Chinese. To understand mind control you need a
basic understanding of BEHAVIOUR MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES.</p>

<p>What is &quot;behaviour modification&quot;?</p>

<p>Simply described, it is &quot;reward or punishment for actions&quot;
association. It was used on you as a child whenever you were
being commended or otherwise for your behaviour.</p>

<p>Taking away a privilege is usually a sure-fire method to
persuading a child to change its behaviour when that child is
old enough to understand the process.  Praising a child for doing
good is another method of changing behaviour, especially in the
child who is anxious to please. The rod of education applied to
the seat of learning is another method of bringing about a
desired behaviour change.</p>

<p>When behaviour modification techniques such as these are
applied in a loving, caring and consistent way, the child
changes their behaviour without holding feelings of resentment.
However, if these techniques are perverted in any way, damage is
done to the child's psyche, their emotions, e.g. the abused child
syndrome. Cults use a sophisticated and perverted form of
behaviour modification which damages an individual's emotions.</p>

<h2><a name="CognitiveDissonance">Cognitive Dissonance</a></h2>

<p>Leon Festinger is a psychologist who studied groups that
predicted the end of the world. He found that most members became
stronger than ever when the prophecy failed. His investigation
revealed that members had to find a way to cope psychologically
with the failure. They needed to maintain order and meaning in
their life. They needed to think they were acting according to
their self-image and values. Festinger described this
contradiction which they had to overcome as what has become known
as the &quot;COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THEORY.&quot;  The three components he
described are:</p>

<ul>

<li>&quot;CONTROL OF BEHAVIOUR&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;CONTROL OF THOUGHTS&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;CONTROL OF EMOTIONS&quot;</li>

</ul>

<p>Each component has a powerful effect on the other two:  CHANGE
ONE AND THE OTHERS WILL TEND TO FOLLOW.  When all three change
the individual undergoes a complete change.  Festinger
summarised the basic principle:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;If you change a person's behaviour, his thoughts and
feelings will change to minimise the dissonance.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>When there is a conflict between thoughts, feelings or
behaviour, then those in conflict will change to minimise the
contradiction. This is because a person can only tolerate a
certain amount of discrepancy between these components which
make up his identity. In cults this dissonance is created to
exploit and control them.</p>

<p>Steven Hassan, author of <cite>Combating Cult Mind
Control</cite>, added a fourth component to Festinger's:</p>

<ul>

<li>&quot;CONTROL OF INFORMATION&quot;</li>

</ul>

<p>By controlling the information one receives you can control
and restrict the individual's ability to think for himself.  You
limit what he is able to think about.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">

<h3><a name="BehaviorControl">BEHAVIOUR CONTROL</a> &#8212; The control
of an individual's physical reality.</h3>

<p>This can include control of where he lives, what he eats, his
clothing, sleep, job, rituals etc. This is why most cults have a
stringent schedule for members. There is always something to do
in destructive cults. Each cult has its own distinctive set of
behaviours that bind it together. This control is so powerful
that the cult member will actually participate in their own
punishment and come to believe he actually deserves it! No one
can command a person's thoughts but IF YOU CAN CONTROL BEHAVIOUR
THEN HEARTS AND MINDS WILL FOLLOW.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">

<h3><a name="ThoughtControl">Thought Control</a> &#8212; The control of an
individual's thought processes.</h3>

<p>The indoctrination of members so thoroughly that they will
manipulate their own thought processes.  The ideology is
internalised as "the truth". Incoming information is filtered
through the beliefs which also regulates how this information is
thought about.</p>

<p>The cult has it's own language which further regulates how a
person thinks. This puts a great barrier between cult members
and outsiders.</p>

<p>Another form of control is &quot;thought stopping&quot; techniques.
This can take many forms: chanting, meditating, singing,
humming, tongues (some even pay money to learn it), concentrated
praying, etc.  The use of these techniques short-circuits the
persons' ability to test reality. The person can only think
positive thoughts about the group. If there is a problem the
member assumes responsibility and works harder.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">
Return to Table of Contents</a></em></p>

<h3><a name="EmotionalControl">Emotional Control</a> &#8212; The control
of the individual's emotional life.</h3>

<p>This manipulates a person's range of feelings. Guilt and fear
are used to keep control. Cult members cannot see the control by
guilt, and like other abuse victims are conditioned to blame
themselves when things are wrong, even grateful when a leader
points out their transgressions.</p>

<p>Fear is used to manipulate two ways. The first is to create
an outside enemy (we vs them) who is persecuting you. The second
is the fear of punishment by the leaders if you are not &quot;good
enough.&quot; Being &quot;good enough&quot; is following the ideology perfectly.
The most powerful emotional control is phobia indoctrination.
This can give the person a panic reaction at the very thought of
leaving the group.  It is almost impossible to conceive that there
is any life outside the group. There is no physical gun held to
their heads but the psychological gun is just as if not more
powerful.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">

<h3><a name="InformationControl">Information Control</a> &#8212; The
control of the individual's information sources.</h3>

<p>Deny a person the information needed to make a sound judgment
and he will be incapable of doing so. People are trapped in cults
because they are denied both the access to the critical
information they need to assess their situation. The
psychological chains on their minds are just as powerful as if
they were locked away physically from society. So strong is this
psychological process they also lack the properly functioning
internal mechanism to process any critical information placed in
front of them.</p>

<h2><a name="EightMarks">The Eight Marks of Mind Control</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Totalism">Totalism &#8212; All or Nothing</a></h3>

<p>Mind Control is a PROCESS of eradicating former beliefs and
instituting new beliefs in their place through the use of
COERCIVE persuasion. It is a PROCESS which is designed to break a
person's independence and individuality and replace it with the
ideology clone. The Chinese called this process &quot;thought reform&quot;
which was poorly translated into English as &quot;brain-washing&quot;.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">
Return to Table of Contents</a></em></p>

<h3><a name="Brainwashing">Brainwashing</a></h3>

<p>Brainwashing is now considered to be a different process to
thought reform or mind control. In brainwashing the victim knows
who is the enemy. An example is American Patty Hearst who was
kidnapped by a terrorist group. Through physical abuse she
finally became a member of the group and took part in terrorist
activities and bank robberies.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">
Return to Table of Contents</a></em></p>

<h3><a name="ThoughtControl2">Thought Control</a></h3>

<p>Thought control is more subtle. The victim doesn't know who is
the enemy because the enemy seems like their best friend who only
has their best interests at heart.</a>

<p>Cults practice a more refined form of thought control than
that used by the Chinese. Leading psychologist, Dr Margaret
Singer, said cults do it better than the Chinese because it is
easier to get people to do what you want through manipulating
them with guilt and anxiety. During this process the prospective
recruit is re-educated and will abandon the precepts he has
learnt from life for the &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot; offered by
the group.  In some cults this is done over a long period of
time;  Other cults can bring about this change within 48 hours.
Whichever way the process takes place the results are the same.
The individual has undergone a total change in personality and
is often unrecognisable by their family.</p>

<p>The process of thought control has been documented by Robert
J. Lifton who researched what happened to the American prisoners
of the Communist Chinese. He labelled the steps which have
become the standard by which to judge whether a group is using
&quot;brain-washing&quot; or &quot;thought reform&quot; on its recruits.</p>

<p>Robert J. Lifton's research showed that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;These criteria consist of eight psychological themes
which are predominant within the social field of the thought
reform milieu. Each has a totalistic quality; each depends upon
an equally absolute philosophical assumption; and each mobilises
certain individual emotional tendencies, mostly of a polarising
nature. Psychological theme, philosophical rationale, and
polarised individual tendencies are interdependent; they require,
rather than directly cause, each other. In combination they
create an atmosphere which may temporarily energise or
exhilarate, but which at the same time poses the gravest of human
threats.&quot; (<cite>Thought Reform &amp; the Psychology of
Totalism</cite>, p. 420)
</blockquote>

<p>The eight marks noted by Lifton are:</p>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">
Return to Table of Contents</a></em></p>

<h3><a name="MilieuControl">1. MILIEU CONTROL</a> &#8212; Control of
the Environment and Communication.</h3>

<p>The control of human communication is the most basic feature
of the thought reform environment. This is the control of what
the individual sees, hears, reads, writes, experiences and
expresses. It goes even further than that, and controls the
individuals communication with himself &#8212; his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Everything other than their beliefs is excluded. The
organisation appears to be omniscient. They seem to know
everything that is going on. Reality is their exclusive
possession. In this environment the individual is deprived of the
combination of external information and internal reflection
required to test reality and to maintain a measure of identity
separate from his environment. The individual can feel victimised
by his controllers and feel the hostility of suffocation &#8212; the
resentful awareness that his striving toward new information,
independent judgment and self-expression are being thwarted.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE - Jehovah's Witnesses are a classical example of a
closed community living within and mixing with the wider
community.  Because they are so well known we have used them as
an example.</p>

<p>e.g. - In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>You could &quot;go beyond the 'truth'&quot; &#8212; beyond what they
taught. This showed you were thinking for yourself and put
yourself above leadership. Those moving ahead of the
Organisation are counselled.
</li></p>

<p><li>No gatherings other than those allowed or organised by
organisation (1982).</li></p>

<p><li>Not making comments from your own thoughts at the
meetings. Only comments from the study articles are permitted.
No independent thinking is permitted.</li></p>

<p><li>The organization always seemed to know what was going on
in your congregation and article appeared in Watchtower
publications just at the right time (&quot;food at the proper time&quot;).
This was done through Circuit Servants reports to
Headquarters.</li></p>

<p><li>Use of 'publisher record cards' etc. to monitor
activities of members. Watchtower is aware of trends etc. by
strict reporting and control of individual Witnesses
activities.</li></p>

<p><li>Report on fellow brothers &amp; sisters (cannot get away from
organisation).
</li></p>

<p><li>Monitoring or observation of disfellowshipped or marked
people.</li></p>

<p><li>Non Witnesses are viewed as 'bad association'</li></p>

<p><li>Worldly education discouraged &#8212; better to go
door-to-door.
</li></p>

<p><li>Employment that takes up time which should be devoted to
Watchtower activities is also discouraged.</li></p>

<p><li>Should be 'buying out the opportune time' in 'theocratic
activities'.</li></p>

<p><li>Taught to indoctrinate self!</li></p>

<p><li>'Shepherding' of those who fall behind.</li></p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="MysticalManipulation">2. MYSTICAL MANIPULATION</a>
&#8212; The Mystique of the Organisation.</a></h3>

<p>This seeks to provoke specific patterns of behaviour and
emotion in such a way that these will appear to have arisen
spontaneously from within the environment. For the manipulated
person this assumes a near-mystical quality. This is not just a
power trip by the manipulators. They have a sense of &quot;higher
purpose&quot; and see themselves as being the &quot;keepers of the truth.&quot;
By becoming the instruments of their own mystique, they create a
mystical aura around the manipulating institution &#8212; the Party,
the Government, the Organisation, etc. They are the chosen agents
to carry out this mystical imperative.</p>

<p>The pursuit of this mystical imperative supersedes all
considerations of decency or immediate human welfare. The end
justifies the means. You can lie, deceive or whatever to those
outside the organization.  Association with the &quot;outside&quot; is only
to benefit their own cause in some way. Some cults like Moonies
and Hare Krishnas call their deception &quot;heavenly deception&quot; or
&quot;transcendental trickery&quot;. Members believe in the ideology to such
a degree that they rationalize these deceptions. Members are kept
in a frenzy of cult-related activities. There is little time or
energy to think about their lifestyle.</p>

<p>&quot;The psychology of the pawn&quot; &#8212; This person feels unable to
escape from forces he sees more powerful than himself.  His way
of dealing with this is to adapt to them.  He learns how to
anticipate problems with the organisation and to manipulate
events to avoid incriminating himself. This is the person who
has been in the organisation long enough, knows something is
wrong, is on the verge of leaving then suddenly becomes very
loyal.  They sell out to the organisation and will turn in
friends who may have confided in them.</p>

<p>e.g. - In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>&quot;Theocratic strategy&quot; &#8212; If you don't have a right to know
the truth &#8212; it is OK to lie to you. (See &quot;Insight&quot; under
'Lie'.)</p></li>

<p><li>Avoid telling prospects &#8212; No blood, holidays, family,
friends, etc.</p></li>

<p><li>Bring someone new each time they call so prospect gets to
know the people at the Kingdom Hall when they attend. (Planned
spontaneity.)</p></li>

<p><li>The ideology supersedes the welfare of the individual.
They are not involved in charities outside the group [or in the
group].</p></li>

<p><li>Not helping fellow members to the detriment of promoting
the ideology. This is more important than helping the sick &amp;
elderly.</p></li>

<p><li>Prayers are general &#8212;  for the organisation, not the needs
of the individual. See God as not interested in you as a
person.</p></li>

<p><li>Blessed only for effort in promoting the Kingdom.</p></li>

<p><li>Ability of organisation to accomplish the 'preaching
work' seen as evidence of Jehovah's blessing, direction and
angelic help.</p></li>

<p><li>Jehovah 'sifts out' those not truly 'in the truth',
those without 'the right heart condition' which is why people
leave or must be disfellowshipped. No one leaves
legitimately.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="DemandForPurity">3. DEMAND FOR PURITY</a> --
Everything is black &amp; white.</h3>

<p>Pure and impure is defined by the ideology of the
organization. Only those ideas, feelings and actions consistent
with the ideology and policy are good.  The individual
conscience is not reliable. The philosophical assumption is that
absolute purity is attainable and that anything done in the name
of this purity is moral. By defining and manipulating the
criteria of purity and conducting an all-out war on impurity
(dissension especially) the organisation creates a narrow world
of guilt and shame. This is perpetuated by an ethos of
continuous reform, the demand that one strive permanently and
painfully for something which not only does not exist but is
alien to the human condition.</p>

<p>Under these conditions the individual expects humiliation,
ostracism and punishment because of his inability to live up to
the criteria and lives in a constant state of guilt and shame.
Since the organisation is the ultimate judge of good and evil,
this guilt and shame is used to manipulate and control members.
The organization becomes an authority without limit in the eyes
of members and their power is nowhere more evident that in their
capacity to &quot;forgive&quot;.</p>

<p>All impurities are seen to originate from &quot;outside&quot; (the
world). Therefore, one of the best ways to relieve himself of
the burden of guilt is to denounce these with great hostility.
The more guilty he feels, the greater his hatred, the more
hostile is his denouncement. Organizationally this eventually
leads to purges of heretics, mass hatred and religious holy
wars. The group will point to the mistakes of all other belief
systems while promoting their own purity. This gives the
impression that their organisation is perfect, clean and pure as
a people or group.</p>

<p>e.g. - In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>Dress and grooming have been laid down at various
times.</li></p>

<ul>

<li>No pantsuits for ladies</li>
<li>No beards or moustaches</li>
<li>Short hair on men</li>
<li>No coloured shirts for men</li>
<li>No gold rimmed glasses</li>
<li>Certain styles of clothing</li>

</ul>

<blockquote>These rules change at the whim of the leaders.</blockquote>

<p><li>Only 2 organisations: Jehovah's and Satan's. You cannot be
part of both.</p></li>

<p><li>World has no conscience - all dishonest.</p></li>

<p><li>Must keep clear of worldly celebrations (Christmas,
Easter, Birthdays, Mother's &amp; Father's Day, Thanksgiving,
etc.)</p></li>

<p><li>Loyalty displayed through meeting attendance and
participation, field service, choice of marriage partners [strong
'in the truth'], shunning disfellowshipped relatives and
friends.</p></li>

</ul>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">
Return to Table of Contents</a></em></p>

<h3><a name="CultOfConfession">4. CULT OF CONFESSION</a> --
Reporting to leadership.</h3>

<p>This is closely related to the demand for purity. Confession
is carried beyond the ordinary religious, legal and therapeutic
expressions to the point of becoming a cult in itself. In
totalist hands, confession becomes a means of exploiting, rather
than offering solace for these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Totalist confession is an act of self-surrender, the
expression of the merging of the individual and environment.
There is a dissolution of self, talents and money.
Conformity.</p>

<p>The cult of confession has effects quite the reverse of its
ideal of total exposure;  rather than eliminating personal
secrets, it increases and intensifies them.</p>

<p>The individual becomes caught up in continuous conflict over
which secrets to preserve and which to surrender, over ways to
reveal lesser secrets can be revealed and ways to protect more
important ones.</p>

<p>The cult of confession makes it virtually impossible to attain
reasonable balance between worth and humility.</p>

<p>e.g. In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>Confessing infringements to an Elder.

<p><li>Putting in field reports (test of spirituality) [A
monthly report of one's activities for that month. How many
hours door-knocking; number of books and magazines sold; number
of people one studied doctrine with, etc.]</p></li>

<p><li>Accept orders without question.  Ask &quot;How high&quot; when told
to jump.</p></li>

<p><li>Any who are aware of another's sin must put this one in
to the elders or the guilt will rest on their shoulders.</p></li>

<p><li>Congregation is made aware of the sin through talks and
restrictions placed on guilty ones.</p></li>

</ul>

<p align="CENTER"><em><a href="#Contents">

<h3><a name="SacredScience">5. SACRED SCIENCE</a> &#8212;  Absolute
&quot;Truth&quot;.</h3>

<p>Their &quot;truth&quot; is the absolute truth.  It is sacred &#8212; beyond
questioning. There is a reverence demanded for the leadership.
They have ALL the answers. Only to them is given the revelation
of &quot;truth&quot;.</p>

<p>The ultimate moral vision becomes the ultimate science and the
person who dares to criticise it, or even think criticism, is
immoral, irreverent and &quot;unscientific&quot;.</p>

<p>The assumption here is not so much that man can be God, but
rather that man's IDEAS can be God.</p>

<p>This gives sense of security to the member. They are
confident they can get the answer to the most difficult problem
or question.</p>

<p>e.g.  In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>You can be disfellowshipped (kicked out) for daring to
question what is taught in their publications.</p></li>

<p><li>Watchtower demands full devotion of members. Members must not
question the Organization (= questioning God).</p></li>

<p><li>There is an answer to everything, if you cannot find it
in the publications you must  'wait on Jehovah' and not 'push
ahead'.</p></li>

<p><li>Organisation itself will survive Armageddon but individual
Jehovah's Witnesses have no such assurance.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="LoadingTheLanguage">6. LOADING THE LANGUAGE</a> --
Thought-terminating cliches.</h3>

<p>Everything is compressed into brief, highly reductive,
definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily
expressed.</p>

<p>There are &quot;good&quot; terms which represents the groups ideology
and &quot;evil&quot; terms to represent everything outside which is to be
rejected. Totalist language is intensely divisive,
all-encompassing jargon, unmercifully judging. To those outside
the group this language is tedious &#8212; the language of
non-thought.</p>

<p>This effectively isolates members from outside world. The only
people who understand you are other members. Other members can
tell if you are really one of them by how you talk.</p>

<p>This narrowness of the language is constricting. The
individual is linguistically deprived because language is
central to the human experience and his capacities for thinking
and feeling are immensely restricted.</p>

<p>While initially this loaded language can give a sense of
security to the new believer, an uneasiness develops over time.
This uneasiness may result in a withdrawal into the system and
he preaches even harder to hide his problem and demonstrate his
loyalty. It may also produce an inner division and the individual
will publicly give the right performance while privately have his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>Either way, his imagination becomes increasingly disassociated
from his actual life experiences and may even tend to atrophy from
disuse.</p>

<p>e.g. - In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<li>Theocratic strategy</li>
<li>&quot;ark of salvation&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;new light&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;meat in due season&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;faithful &amp; discreet slave&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;apostate&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The anointed&quot;</li>
<li>Book study</li>
<li>Christendom</li>
<li>&quot;Christ Jesus&quot; instead of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;</li>
<li>'back calls' now called 'return visits' (terminology changes
indicate who might be falling behind or who is not really a
member)</li>
<li>&quot;Jehovah will take care of it in his due time.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;It's the truth&quot; &#8212; doesn't matter if they make a
mistake</li>
<li>Where else is there to go?</li>
<li>Worldly</li>
<li>Governing Body</li>
<li>New System of Things</li>

<h3><a name="DoctrineOverPerson">7. DOCTRINE OVER PERSON</a> --
Doctrine supersedes human experience.</h3>

<p>The ideological myth merges with their &quot;truth&quot; and the
resulting fantasy can be so overpowering and coercive that is
simply replaces reality.  Consequently past events can be
altered, rewritten or even ignored to make them consistent with
the current reality. This alteration is especially lethal when
the distortions are imposed on the individual's memory.</p>

<p>They demand character and identity of a person be reshaped to
fit their clone of mentality. The individual must fit the rigid
contours of the doctrinal mould instead of developing their own
potential and personality.</p>

<p>The underlying assumption is that the doctrine &#8212; including
its mythological elements &#8212; is ultimately more valid, true and
real than is any aspect of actual human character or human
experience. The individual under such pressure is propelled into
an intense conflict with his own sense of integrity, a struggle
which takes place in relation to polarized feelings of sincerity
and insincerity.</p>

<p>Absolute sincerity is demanded by the group yet this must be
put to one side when changes take place the individual has to
deny the original belief ever existed. Personal feelings are
suppressed and members must appear to be contented and
enthusiastic at all times.</p>

<p>Some cults believe that all illness is a result of lack of
faith and evidence of sin in your life.  These things have to be
prayed away and medical attention is ignored as a &quot;sign of
faith.&quot;</p>

<p>e.g. - In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>&quot;There is no life outside the organisation&quot;  so when they
see people who have made a life outside they revert back to
doctrine over what they see.</p></li>

<p><li>If an experience doesn't fit, it must be demons.</p></li>

<p><li>Will ignore needs of others because doctrine overrides
human experience. i.e. will ignore needs of disfellowshipped or
marked persons no matter how serious those needs are.</p></li>

<p><li>Those who were JW's before 1975 and are still JW's will
deny they ever believed Armageddon was due that year &#8212; even
those who sold homes, delayed medical treatment etc.</p></li>

<p><li>Watchtower has final authority even over personal
experience. Blood transfusions, etc. Conscience matters are
discussed only in the light of Watchtower doctrine (not left to
individuals' consciences).</p></li>

<h3><a name="DispensingOfExistence">8. DISPENSING OF
EXISTENCE</a> &#8212; Who is worthy to live.</h3>

<p>They have the right to decide who is worthy of life and who
isn't. They also decide which history books are accurate and
which are not.</p>

<p>Those in the organisation are worthy of life; those outside
worthy of death.  The outsiders can be permitted to live if they
change and become an insider. Members live in fear of being
pronounced &quot;dead&quot;. They have a fear of annihilation or
extinction. The emotional conflict is one of &quot;being vs
nothingness&quot;.</p>

<p>Existence comes to depend upon creed (I believe, therefore I
am), upon mission (I obey, therefore I am) and beyond these,
upon a sense of total merger with the organisation.  Should he
stray from the &quot;truth&quot; his right to exist may be withdrawn and
he is pronounced &quot;dead&quot;.</p>

<p>e.g. - In Jehovah's Witnesses:</p>

<ul>

<p><li>&quot;Sheep and goats&quot; &#8212;  how  one responds to &quot;Christ's
brothers&quot; decides their future. (&quot;Christ's brothers&quot; are those
who rule the organisation. How you respond to their message as
carried by their messengers decides your eternal
future).</p></li>

<p><li>Elders decide who is worthy of life at Judicial Committee
meetings.</p></li>

<p><li>They decide who is worthy of a resurrection &#8212; (Sodom
&amp; Gommorah).</p></li>

<p><li>Disfellowshiping 'sinners' denies them any hope for a
future outside the Organisation.</p></li>

<p><li>They will blatantly lie to achieve goals and consider this
to be &quot;theocratic strategy&quot;.</p></li>

<p><li>Any information contrary to the Watchtower 'system' is not
considered worth listening to or reading.</p></li>

<p><li>Witnesses are forbidden to discuss such information,
especially if is considered 'apostate' [put together by former
members]</p></li>

<h2><a name="Summary">In Summary...</a></h2>

<p>The more clearly these eight points are obvious, the greater
the resemblance to ideological totalism. The more an organisation
utilises such totalist devices to change individuals, the greater
its resemblance to thought reform.</p>

<p>Remember ..... A group does not have to be religious to be
cultic in behaviour.  High demand groups can be commercial,
political and psychological. Be aware, especially if you are a
bright, intelligent and idealistic person.  The most likely
person to be caught up in this type of behavioural system is the
one who says &quot;I won't get caught.  It will never happen to me.
I am too intelligent for that sort of thing.&quot;</p>
