Subject:  	Your Website &amp; My Experience with the CULT of Doom

<p>
Hi, AO &#8212;

<p>
I just discovered your website today and I am just totally
impressed with all of your info and documentation.  I was a member of
the &quot;AA Cult&quot; for seven years &#8212; I joined when I was a vulnerable 18 year
old and stayed around long enough to witness so much sick,  twisted,
despicable behavior by allegedly &quot;recovering&quot; individuals; I want to
vomit just thinking of some of the things I saw (especially the sexual
exploitation of women)!  Unfortunately, I, like some of your other
correspondents, have had the experience of knowing too many people who
ate shotguns while &quot;sober;&quot; the love of my young life stuck his head
under a train while &quot;working the steps.&quot;  And of course, the cult
members made every hideous suicide all about themselves and &quot;the
program!&quot;

<p>
I have to tell you, up until I left the cult or &quot;got cured&quot;
as they like to say of us dissenters, my life was going nowhere, I was
in and out of psychiatric hospitals, broke, alone, fat &#8212; I was a TOTAL
LOSER.  Then, I pulled the ten-thousandth knife out of my back and
decided to grow up! Amazing things happened &#8212; I was offered
a terrific new job, completed my college degree (and completed two more
after that)! finally met a decent guy, had a family, now have my dream
career, travel around the world, etc., etc., etc.  All I had to do was
get AWAY from those sick, twisted bastards.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I haven't touched a drop of
alcohol or any drugs for 12 years and I know the secret cure for
those who may be looking for answers in all the wrong places:  If you
want to stop drinking, don't drink! If you don't want to use drugs,
don't take, snort, smoke, buy, manufacture, or distribute them.  Do what
I did &#8212; GROW THE HELL UP!  Again, thanks for all the good info and take
care... don't let the bastards get to you!

<p>

Stephanie, Northern California

Hi Stephanie,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments, and thanks for brightening my day with
a success story. Glad to hear that you escaped from hell and got a better life.
<p>
I'm in a good mood, too. Your letter arrived on my anniversary. Yes, 5 years off

It's a good day for celebrating victories
(in some quiet manner, of course).

Hi A.O, I want to share this bit of Oxford, AA, history with you and
get your take on it.
<br>
Ric

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Hey Rick,

<p>

Have you ever read the book 'Not God' by Kurtz? When it comes to the
history of AA, it contains a slightly different version of history from
official story of how the fellowship grew. I've read some stuff on Frank
Buchman and he was very much the Pat Robertson of his day. His own ego
caught up to him and the Oxfords became mirred in controversy. From what
I understand, it was Frank Buchman himself that requested that the
alcoholics take a hike from the Oxford meetings. The revisionist history
makes it out like the first hundred had an ephaney and decided to split
form the Oxfords when in fact it was that didn't to have anything to do
with Bill and his band of drunks.

<p>

That's my rant for today. I hope all is well with you on your end.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

Peace Shalom

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ric,
<p>
Yes, I have a similar take on it.
I don't recall anything that explicitly documented Frank Buchman giving
the order to kick Bill Wilson out of the Oxford Group,
but there is no doubt that Frank would not have
liked Bill's style. Frank Buchman wanted to be surrounded by millionaires and
kings, not by shabby penniless alcoholics, so there is little doubt that
Bill would have soon grated on Frank Buchman's nerves.
It must have been downright embarrassing for Frank Buchman to have ragged
derelicts following him around and crashing his parties.
<p>
In addition, Bill told the story that some of the Oxford Group leaders
conducted a &quot;Quiet Time&quot; with him, and received a
<i>&quot;Guidance&quot;</i> from above that
said that Bill was supposed to stop working with
alcoholics. Bill refused to follow that order.
<p>

It looks like both Frank Buchman and Sam Shoemaker kept their skirts
clean by having underlings get rid of Wilson and the alcoholics.
<p>

In his book <i><b>Bill W.</b></i>, Robert Thomsen
wrote that Sam Shoemaker let one of his assistants do the dirty work for him
while Shoemaker was conveniently absent.
<p>
At large Oxford Group meetings, the
Wilsons heard that they were &quot;not maximum&quot; and that someone
had ordered that no more alcoholics from the
Calvary Mission should attend the Oxford Group meetings at Bill's house.

<p>
At one Sunday service at Sam Shoemaker's church, Bill and Lois Wilson found that
they were the subject of the sermon.

Sam Shoemaker's assistant preacher accused Bill Wilson of having ulterior motives and of
building a deviant cult or group of his own within the Oxford Group.
<p>
Bill and Lois considered that to be an expulsion from the Oxford Group,
so they quit the Group and took their alcoholics with them.
They continued having meetings at their house on Clinton Street,
just the same as before,
but they didn't have a name for their new group, for a while.
It was still Buchmanism, without the name or Frank Buchman.

<p>
Note that Robert Thomsen wrote <i><b>Bill W.</b></i> based on a set of autobiographical
tape recordings that Bill made before his death.
So that story in fact comes straight from Bill Wilson.
<p>
The story that Bill had an epiphany and saw a higher mission than the
Oxford Group sounds like just some more of Bill's minimization and denial,
and telling tall tales, wanting to gloss over the fact that Bill Wilson
was actually kicked out of something.
<p>
There are a few more details
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#not_maximum">here</a>.

<p>
Thanks for an interesting question, and have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Sir Lancelot&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Good Morning!<br>

<p>

Dear Mr Orange,

<p>

I came across your website quite by accident. After
reading some but not all of the material you
presented, I can understand why Yahoo shut the website
down.

<p>

Your writings indicate that you are full of hate,
resentment, fear, and intolerance. I did not find
love, patience, nor kindness in your writings. From
your writings, you do not seem to be a very nice
person.

<p>

My hope and prayer is that you do not drink and if you
are already drunk, my hope and pray is that you will
get sober.

<p>

If you do or if you are already ready drunk, I hope
you do not kill someone or yourself in the process.
Alcoholism is a dangerous disease and to assume any
other position is to take a very dangerous position.
&gt;From my own experience, when a person has the level of
unresolved anger and resentment that your website
indicates that you have, this person eventual drinks.
And if they drink they end up dying from their
drinking or getting locked up in jails or institutions
from their drinking. We do not need AA to prove this
fact. All we have to do is look the results of
unresolved alcoholism throughout history.

<p>

All I have to offer you is my own experience as a
recovered alcoholic, based on my own life and the
lives of my friends and family.

<p>

I feel for you .. I will pray for you ... I will pray
that you come to grips with your own apparent
suffering, your fellow sufferers, and the God of your
understanding.

<p>

May God bless you and keep you!<br>
Thanks for your time,<br>
A concerned reader of your website.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Lancelot,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Apparently you read some of those sections where I pretty harshly condemn quacks who
foist cult religion and misinformation about alcoholism on sick people, and
many of them actually
get paid to do it by the city, state, and federal governments.
<p>
I think it is a despicable crime to make money by hurting sick people.<br>
I think it is a despicable crime to deceive people in the name of God.<br>
<p>
My anger at such immoral behavior has not made me drink alcohol. It made me write a bunch
of web pages to get the truth out there.
My sobriety is doing just fine, thank you anyway.

<p>
I don't even understand why I am not supposed to feel contempt and anger at criminals
who hurt people. Can you explain that?
<p>
Can you explain why the A.A. approach to problem-solving amounts to
passively letting criminals run the &quot;recovery industry&quot;?

<p>
(Oh, I have a pretty good idea of why you think that I shouldn't feel anything.
It's because Bill Wilson wrote that you are 
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#disturbed">
&quot;axiomatically spiritually at fault&quot; if you get disturbed</a> by anything.
Bill was full of bull. That is just cultish insistence that
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel">you should not
feel your own feelings</a>.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>

Subject:  	My View

<p>

After some 50 plus years of using alcohol ( I am 72) and, maybe, 20 of
active &quot;alcoholism&quot;, 12 detoxes, two  28-day rehabs, all under the thumb
of 12-step philosophies, I feel qualified to comment about AA. I have
done three 90/90's, spoken at AA meetings, run discussion groups and
during it all I kept relapsing for some 12 years. Then I gave up on AA
and now have been sober for some 14 years.

<p>

I feel that AA eventually caused me to relapse again and again. But I
will not knock AA like some others do. After my first detox, I felt that
AA saved my life. I had so much shame and remorse that I had serious
thoughts of suicide. In the first AA meetings I saw people just like me,
and my self esteem rose. Next couple of relapses AA still seemed like a
light in the darkness that enveloped me.

<p>

But as time went on, AA became a reminder and trigger that I had a
&quot;disease&quot;, and caused me to give up and indulge. The problem is that AA
continues to address shame and remorse, when a pragmatical look into the
future and not a constant reminder is in order.

<p>

So, in my, admittedly limited, view,  AA has a place for the newly
remorseful individual, but fails miserably in serious long term &quot;recovery&quot;.

Subject:  	Hi Orange

<p>

Hello,

<p>

I had been a cult member for 2 years up to one month ago?

<p>

I just wanted to thank you personally for being a big part in my leaving
the cult. When I first saw your site I was googling for information
about egotistical sex predator AA oldtimer, and Orange was the first match.

<p>

I had a bad experience with one old-timer in particular, who was as
described above.

<p>

Wouldn't it be great if we had a black list of nasty oldtimers?

<p>

Finding your site opened my eyes.

<p>

Thanks<br>
Paul W.

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your escape.

<p>
A list of nasty oldtimers sure sounds like it would be great, but alas,
I don't see how it could really work. The first big gotcha is the
anonymity and duplication of names.
How many Johns and Freds and Toms and Dicks and Harrys are there
in this country? Far too many for first names to identify anybody.
The whole A.A. policy of anonymity helps the criminals to hide
from identification.

<p>
Even adding the initial of the last name doesn't help much.
And if we say something more specific like, &quot;Harry K. of Cincinnatti&quot;, that still
doesn't precisely identify the guy. He can always say that the bad
guy is some other &quot;Harry K&quot;.
And he can move from one city to another. Sexual predators often do, after
they have burned out one territory.

<p>
If we explicitly print the full name and address, then we'd better
have rock-solid evidence that can stand up in court, to survive a libel lawsuit.
(Not to mention a large legal defense fund.)
If we had that kind of evidence about a sexual predator, then we could just
turn it over to the police and let them get rid of the guy (like they did
with
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">my child-molesting 12-Step counselor</a>.)
<p>
== Oh, which is something to think about. If you have evidence about a sexual
predator, you should think about giving it to the police. You might save somebody
else.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	Tricycle's Daily Dharma - Forwarded by ptrmagee

<p>

Hail Secret Agent Man, Purveyor of Most Excellent Intelligence! This
piece of wisdom I wanted to share with you since it reminds me so much
of Jack T.'s AVRT, which is a good application of mindfulness itself.

<p>
<blockquote>

Tricycle's Daily Dharma: October 21, 2005
<p>
<b>Self Discipline and Patience</b><br>
&quot;Discipline&quot; is a difficult word for most of us. It conjures up images
of somebody standing over you with a stick, telling you that you're
wrong. But self-discipline is different. It's the skill of seeing
through the hollow shouting of your own impulses and piercing their
secret. They have no power over you. It's all a show, a deception. Your
urges scream and bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they threaten;
but they really carry no stick at all. You give in out of habit. You
give in because you never really bother to look beyond the threat. It is
all empty back there. There is only one way to learn this lesson,
though. The words on this page won't do it. But look within and watch
the stuff coming up &#8212; restlessness, anxiety, impatience, pain &#8212; just watch
it come up and don't get involved. Much to your surprise, it will simply
go away. It rises, it passes away. As simple as that. There is another
word for self-discipline. It is patience.<br>

Hi ptrmagee,
<p>
Yes, wow, thanks for that note. That sounds exactly like that stupid little
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">lizard brain addiction monster</a>
yelling for me to smoke a cigarette and drink a beer.
This dharma is the same message, in a slightly different vocabulary. Good stuff.
<p>
One line that really resonates with me is the statement about a strong desire,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;Much to your surprise, it will simply go away. It rises, it passes
away. As simple as that.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Yes. I find it downright odd how when I resist the urges and cravings, that they
just evaporate. In ten seconds flat they are dead and gone. How strong can those
&quot;irresistable&quot; cravings really be, if they are dead in 10 seconds when
you fight them?

<p>
It's really funny when you realize that the desires don't even last as long as it
takes to smoke one cigarette or drink one beer.

<p>
Thanks again for brightening my day, and have a good day.

Hi Joakim,

Thanks for the compliments. And yes, it really is amazing and appalling what
kind of a guy Bill Wilson was. Sometimes it is flat-out amazing how such creeps
can become the leaders of huge successful cults. And yet they do.
It doesn't seem to matter whether it's L. Ron Hubbard with Scientology,
or Werner Erhard with EST, or Rev. Sun Myung Moon with his Unification Church,
or Rev. Jim Jones and his Peoples' Temple &#8212; those monsters are enormously
successful in becoming rich and famous.

But actually, the one single thing I am pretty sure Bill Wilson didn't
have anything to do with was the conspiracy to kill JFK. ... :-)

<font color="blue">
Hello Joakim,
<p>
I don't think you are a liar. I think you are confused.
<p>
You
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">confuse correlation with causation</a>.
<p>
There is no evidence that A.A. saved your life, or that you would not be
alive without A.A..
<p>
Now I would agree with a statement like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I would be dead if I had not stopped drinking.&quot;
</font>
Yeh, I will agree with that.
<p>
But the fact that you like A.A. meetings does not prove or even suggest that
they made you quit drinking.
<p>
The real reason you quit drinking is because you decided to quit drinking.
You got tired of the pain. You got sick and tired of being sick and tired.
</font>

<p>
Am i weaker then you? less smart?
<p>
<a name="obsess"> </a>

Are you sure that you been sober whitout AA? To me (after reading the
LArge amount you wrote or collected on your site) you seems more
obsessed bye the 12 step programs then any of the members i know of. How
many hours of your 5 years have you spent on this site?

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's a false assumption. If someone works hard at something, and does a thorough
job of it, he is &quot;obsessed&quot;? Would I be better off if I had spent
all of those
hours on 5 years of sitting in A.A. meetings?
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
P.S.: It's funny, really, when I think about it. I go on vacation from the hassles
of this web site for nearly a whole year, and as soon as I come back and do
a little more work, I hear that I am &quot;obsessed with 12 step programs&quot;.
If I were any less obsessed, I'd never get anything done.
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
On the statistic on succes rate in AA i want to mention one thing ,
Where i live the most talked about and &quot;succesfull &quot; treatment was
called &quot; hassela-treatment&quot;, In a statistic from 1980-1981 done bye the
goverment it coud show up an 80% succes rate after 5 year, aint that great?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Please send the official report. Hearsay is worthless as evidence.
You have to read all of the fine print to figure out if the results are
faked or fraudulent or invalid.
</font>
<p>
Now ....i was in that group of drugaddicts we where  12  &quot;patients&quot;
those years,  in 1985  8 was dead, i know them all personal  and i
attended on most of their funerals.
<p>
Im now NOT easily impressed by statistics after that.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I am not impressed by statistics either, especially not the A.A. and N.A.
statistics where they say that their program works great, and then you have
to go to your friends' funerals anyway.
<p>
But you cannot dismiss all statistics as fraudulent.
It's a matter of what they are reporting, and who is doing the reporting,
and what their ulterior motives might be.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
When a report (often produced by some shill for a treatment center)
 says that some treatment program works great and produces lots of
 successes, it is probably a lie and a fraud.
<li>
When a report says that some treatment didn't work at all, it is probably
telling the truth.
</ol>
<p>
Why? Because treatment does not work, that's why.
<p>
What works is people getting tired of the pain, and deciding to quit drinking.
</font>

<p>
A lot of what you wrote here is sure true , but  after thought about it
, i was thinking to myself &quot;bill w was a sick alcoholic&quot; it really
doesnt shock me.
<p>
So my main question, im happy in my life whit AA and greatfull for that
i belong there,
<p>
Am i wrong ? I must be if you are right.
<p>
Woud be great if u can estimeate the time you spent on this site , i
will compare it to the time i spended on my frst 5 years om meetings e.t.c.
<p>
regards<br>
B. Rat

<p>
<font color="blue">
The fact that you enjoy the A.A. cult does not make it a good organization.
And it doesn't make A.A. have a good success rate in curing alcoholics.
You are again confusing cause and effect with correlation or coincidence.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Agent Orange &#8212;
<p>
The more of your work I read, the more I like.  I am trying to track down
the origin (truth?) of a snippet of W.'s, supposedly published in one of the
early essays in the Grapevine Rag (April of 1949, I think) that quotes him
as saying something to the effect of: &quot;We do not propose that 'our' way is
the 'only' way to obtain sobriety.&quot;  Do you know anything about this?

<p>
I also find it interesting to note that two of A.A.'s most cherished
precepts make no sense to at least one-fourth of the worlds population, that
being those in the Far East.  There is no cultural concept of either an &quot;HP&quot;
or of &quot;powerlessness.&quot;

<p>
Keep up the good work and keep on stirring the pot!

<p>
There is, btw, a good read available titled: &quot;Addiction is a Choice&quot; by Dr.
(Ph.D type) Jeffery Schaler that you might find enjoyable.  Feel free to
reply to me personally if you so choose.

<font color="blue">
Hi Dan'l,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.
<p>

Bill Wilson made a bunch of remarks like &quot;A.A. is not the only way&quot;
and &quot;We know only a little&quot;.
Unfortunately, you can't take those remarks too seriously because Bill talked out of
both sides of his mouth, saying whatever was convenient at the moment.
He regularly alternated between &quot;A.A. is not the only way&quot;
and &quot;A.A. IS the only way&quot;.
<p>
I couldn't find that Grapevine quote, but I found plenty of others.
See the &quot;Bait And Switch&quot; item on
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">A.A. is <i>The Only Way</i></a>&quot;.
<p>
Also check out the Cult Test item,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way">11. Insistence that the cult is THE ONLY WAY.</a>
<p>
About &quot;Addiction is a Choice&quot;, oh yeh. I read that about 4 1/2 years ago,
and loved it.
It's on my &quot;<a href="orange-top10.html#Schaler">Top 10</a>&quot; list.
I think it also contributed to my recovery a bit.

Subject:  	sharing some info with you

<p>

you have great material on your site especially where it pertains to
kid boot camps, and cults. Thank you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Marilyn,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>

As for AA, i respect where you're coming from.

<p>

i've spent countless years going to meetings. you hear lots of
assholes saying all kinds of things about drugs (medications), god
and what have you.

<p>

you also hear lots of members countering those assholes (often at the
same meetings), saying exactly the same things you say, and
criticizing them for the same reasons you do.

<p>

I have never been to a meeting where someone has come down against
drugs where there hasn't been someone (often me) who doesn't pipe up
and speak in favor of whatever prescribed  medication the person is
taking including  Psychotropic Drugs drugs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.<br>
The fact that you have not seen something does not prove that it does
not exist.
<p>
The very first friend of
mine who went to a Dual Diagnosis meeting was immediately told to stop taking his
doctor-prescribed medications. And I've heard it from lots of other people
too. It is nice that at your favorite meetings you don't tolerate the
&quot;No Medications&quot; dogma, but that doesn't stop it from happening at other
meetings, does it?

</font>
<p>

Live and let live is a general tenet.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

i've attended agnostic meeting regularly where the members don't rely
on a higher power (very popular with the French and old lefties) .

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

i've been to meetings that attract what they call aa  nazis &#8212; hard-liners,
who are basically the types that seem to interest you. And
I've often walked out of them. or stayed and argued depending on my
mood and whether I think it is healthy for me to do so.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The &quot;Step-Nazis&quot; are only one of the many serious problems with A.A..
</font>
<p>

And i've been to meetings where primarily older people feel
comfortable. I've been to women's meetings. I've been to writer's
meetings. I've been to gay meetings.  I've been to meetings in
different countries all around the world. I've seen tremendous
extensions of love and support among members. I've seen quite simply
lives saved and lives repaired and happiness gained.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I have seen people regain their health and their lives by quitting drinking,
too, but there is no evidence that such recovery was caused by A.A. meetings or
the Twelve Steps... The recovery is caused by the decision to quit drinking alcohol.
</font>
<p>

Point is it attracts all kinds. Unlike cults which have charismatic
leaders, AA is utterly democratic (actually more  benign anarchy). It
doesn't ask that you believe in god, and it allows for any kind of
discussion around the topic. there are no rules. only suggestions. (I
for instance have never had a sponsor).

<p>
<font color="blue">
No way is A.A. democratic. If you think it is democratic, why don't you
hold an election and fire the leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
who committed perjury in Mexico and Germany to put innocent A.A. members in
jail for the crime of &quot;carrying the message&quot; to other poor alcoholics by
printing and giving away cheap copies of the out-of-copyright editions of
the Big Book?
<p>
You can't do it. A.A. is fake democracy. You can vote all you want, and nothing
will change.
You control nothing. You run nothing.
You can't fix what's broken.
</font>
<p>

In 16 years I think I've been to only one meeting where someone was
asked to stop speaking and that was because it didn't have anything
to do with AA or anything.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

How it works is simple. Before there were the steps, higher power,
traditions, big book,  it was just two drunks in a room in ohio
helping each other stay sober.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's the fairy tale. A pretty fairy tale.
It has no connection with reality though.<br>
Read
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">
the history of the Oxford Group</a>
for the truth.
</font>
<p>

And that's still how it works, the rest you take or leave as you
want. &quot;The conversion experience,&quot; if you will, is the point where
you say i need help.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, the &quot;conversion experience&quot; is when you say,
&quot;I really have to quit killing myself, now.&quot;
</font>
<p>

I've done both stayed sober without AA, and stayed sober with AA. the
later is as they say easier way by far simply because it supplies
support.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is very questionable. The A.A. bad advice and misinformation kills a lot of people.
Even A.A. trustee Dr. George Vaillant declared that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">the A.A. death rate was appalling</a>.

</font>
<p>

in my family i have had both a mother and a brother die directly as a
result of booze. It's a life threatening disease and a heartbreak to
those who have to deal  with it first hand.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is not a disease. It is habitual behavior. And lots of us have had to
&quot;deal with it first-hand&quot;, including me. You have no monopoly on suffering.
</font>
<p>
If it (AA) works and I can say it does in so many cases where and
when nothing else works, (mine for instance) then... so be it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It does not work.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">A.A. has a zero-percent
success rate above normal spontaneous remission</a>.
All that A.A. is doing is stealing the credit
from the people who were going to quit anyway.
</font>
<p>

I have also had direct and long-term experience with a destructive
cult, and believe me AA for all its faults and for all  the ignorance
of some of its members (remember we're drunks! not saints or even
sane) is not a destructive cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is another cult. Read <a href="orange-cult.html">the cult test</a>.
</font>
<p>
It saves lives when it works.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">it doesn't work</a>,
so that is the end of that.
</font>
<p>

and believe me anyone who suffers would welcome a new method either
to supplement their program or replace it. After all the primary
purpose is to stay sober.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Huh? You aren't making sense. Are you saying that you would welcome
something that will replace Alcoholics Anonymous?
Will you help to promote something that works better than A.A.?
</font>
<p>

You can stay sober without  AA. I've done it, but you do it without
the support of a community, which is where the spirit is.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh really now. What spirit? Cult cliquishness?
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">We are special</a>&quot;?
<p>
What about the spirit that you will find in a good church, like maybe your local
Black Baptist Church? Those people really know how to celebrate the love of God.
They really raise some spirits. A.A. has no monopoly on spirits.
</font>

You have a good day too.

I was researching on line today and saw the paper &quot;The Dry Drunk&quot;.

<p>

It is, unfortunately, not an accurate representation of Alcoholics
Anonymous.  It makes numerous unsupportable claims.  What is most
unfortunate though, is that it is presented as educational materials.
How many drunks who might otherwise have a chance to get sober won't
because of poorly researched and heavily biased material like this.

<p>

What passion so drives you to be so critical of Dr.
Harry M. Tiebout.  I've worked in the field of
chemical dependency for over twenty-five years.
Nothing seems to benefit the alcoholic or addict as
much as AA, NA, etc.  Do you have a better
alternative?  Let's hear about it.  But, do hurry up.
They are dying out there while you sputter about what
you think doesn't work.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Bernie,
<p>
When you claim that &quot;Nothing seems to benefit the alcoholic or addict as
much as AA, NA, etc.&quot;, I have to ask,
<p>
&quot;What planet are you from?&quot;

<p>
Or &quot;What have you been smoking or drinking?&quot;

<p>
Or &quot;Have you simply never tried anything other than 12-Step treatments on your patients?&quot;

<p>
I have repeatedly spoken about the alternatives, starting with the most successful
program in the world,
<a href="orange-letters14.html#diy"><i>Do It Yourself</i></a>,
and then there is
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>,
or
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a>,
and there is
<a href="orange-top10.html#Trimpey2">Addictive Voice Recognition Therapy</a>,
also known at &quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.

<p>
Have you been using the same 12-Step quack treatment program on your patients for the
last 25 years? Without any changes or improvements?
You must have quite a vested interest in believing that it works,
don't you?
<p>
You sure don't want to believe that you spent 25 years foisting quack medicine on
your clients, do you?

<p>
By the way, how did you measure &quot;benefit to the addict&quot;?
I mean really. How did you measure it?
<p>
Have you ever, in your 25 years of &quot;treating addicts&quot;,
ever done a single valid
<a href="orange-letters26.html#Randomized_Longitudinal">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</a>
to test whether
the 12-Step Treatment actually works any better than anything else?
Or better than nothing at all?
Where and when did you publish the results of your study?
<p>
If you didn't do any such study, then how did you determine that
&quot;nothing seems to benefit the addicts as much as&quot; the 12-Step dance?

<p>
You didn't do any such study or test at all, did you? You just shoved the 12-Step
baloney on your patients and then took the credit for the few cases of spontaneous
remission, didn't you?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Hello, I really enjoyed your site.  Question:  where
do the drop-out rate statistics come from and what
were the circumstances?

<p>
I've been attending meeting off/on for more than 10
years, mostly off, as I was for the most part able to
stop drinking with AA, however I succumbed to benzo
addiction (which I also quit without help).  Lately
I've been going more often, but I don't want to get
mixed up with the brainwashed types.  I've found those
guys are pretty easy to spot.  Mainly I get a lift
from the meetings and talk football with a few guys.
I think about half the people who I run into at this
meeting are not brainwashed.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments, and I'm glad you enjoy the web site.
And I'm glad you are feeling better.
<p>

Now, for the really big $64,000 Question:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;where do the drop-out rate statistics come from and what
were the circumstances?&quot;
</font>

<p>
Oh, I'm so glad you asked that, because the answer is almost too good to be true.
<p>
The answer is,
<font color="brown">
&quot;The information comes straight from the A.A. headquarters.
They did the surveys and collected the information and printed the results.&quot;
</font>
<p>
What happened is, the A.A. headquarters conducts surveys every three years, which are
quite logically called &quot;the Triennial Surveys&quot;.
They ask all kinds of questions about their members, including,
&quot;How long have you been sober&quot;,
&quot;How long have you been in A.A.?&quot;, and
&quot;How were you introduced to A.A.?&quot;

<p>
In 1990, they wrote up a summary and analysis of the previous five triennial surveys,
called &quot;<i>Comments on A.A.'s Triennial Surveys</i>&quot;,
document number &quot;5M/12-90/TC&quot;.
One of the things that document revealed was that A.A. had a horrendous failure rate
(or dropout rate, same difference). Eighty percent of the newcomers were gone in
a month; 90% in three months, and 95% were gone at the end of the first year.
<p>
Here is the chart that revealed the dwindling membership:
<p>

Figure C-1 from page 12 of the Commentary on the Triennial Surveys
(from 1977 to 1989), A.A. internal document number 5M/12-90/TC<br>

<i>Addiction, Change &amp; Choice; The New View of Alcoholism</i>,
Vince Fox, M.Ed. CRREd., page 66</font>
</center>
</font></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
The A.A. headquarters decided not to release that information to the public,
but somehow, Charles Bufe, the author of the book
&quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cult_or_cure">Alcoholics Anonymous, Cult or Cure?</a>&quot;
got ahold of a copy of the report, and talked about it in his book.

<p>
An arsonist set fire to Bufe's garage and destroyed most of his
files on Alcoholics Anonymous, but, fortunately, the critical document survived, and has
since been released to the Internet. You can see a copy of it
on 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://thearidsite.tripod.com/12COMMEN.HTM">The Arid Site</a> website,
and I plan to put up a copy of it soon, too, complete with annotations.

<p>
Can you believe that A.A. has sunk so low that it stoops to burning down people's
houses to suppress information about Alcoholics Anonymous?
That's what kind of an organization it has become.
(But then again, A.A. has also
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">committed perjury in the
courts of Mexico and Germany</a>
to put A.A. members in prison in order to protect its profits, so it
comes as no great surprise.)

<p>
There is also other relevant information about the A.A. failure rate that can
be derived from those Triennial Surveys.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">Michael did a perceptive analysis</a>
that
revealed that the A.A. old-timers were missing. That is, when you look at the
distribution of ages of A.A. members, there are far fewer old-timers than
there should be. It's like most of them evaporated or something. Again, the
source of information is the official A.A. summaries of the Triennial Surveys.

<p>
And then there is another summary of the most recent triennial survey
that was printed in the A.A. Grapevine
that revealed that 61% of the A.A. members had been
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table">coerced, shoved, or pressured
into A.A.</a> by the criminal justice system or the health care system.
A.A's own documents reveal that
A.A. is anything but a voluntary program of &quot;attraction, not promotion.&quot;
A.A.'s own reports show that it is a program of &quot;coercion, not attraction.&quot;
<p>
Thanks for a great question.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
hey
<p>
I was recently arrested for dui, and my friends and lawyer advised I
start getting signatures, so I have been going to AA meetings for 3
months, about 3 a week.  At first it kind of sounded good, until I tried
to fit Spinoza's God into it all.  I have a &quot;sponsor&quot; that has really
been trying to sell me, and telling me to stop thinking so much.  I
tried to tell him about the ADD, and my inability to do so, but he,
bless his alcoholic heart, is still trying.  Hopefully the signatures will
ease my probation some.  So anyway, I am going, and I started to make a
project out of it.  For a while I was mentioning other ways to think
about addiction, and I could see the eyes of a few confused people light
up.  I think a good way to get people to go to a site is to say
something like &quot;I saw this site, and they really bash the program.  You
should got see it, it is at www.xxx &lt;http://www.xxx&gt;.

<p>
The last meeting, I started not talking at all. And I don't say my name
or that I am &quot;just listening.&quot;  The table leader made me say my name,
&quot;just so we all know who we are talking to.&quot;  So I said my name, but no
label.  I am going to do that for a while.  I am likely to be court
ordered to go, and I don't know if my PO will be a AA advocate, so I
don't want to get labeled a poor unfortunate, and subjected to even more
treatment.

<p>
I had been doing a lot of reading, and ran across your site.  A lot of my
thoughts were reflected in your writings.  I admit I drank too much
(almost 3 sober now.)  But I felt it was a behavior I got addicted to &#8212;
an activity to which I related good times, etc.  I don't see how a
supernatural being will remove my desire to drink, and do so only when I
actively profess that I need it.  I guess the squeeky wheel gets to keep
away from the lubrication!!!  I hope you don't mind, but I printed a
bunch of fortune coookie sized fliers that say &quot;An AA MUST READ!!!:&quot;
followed by your link.  I figure I can easily leave them around at
meetings, and they will help someone realize what is happening to them.

Subject:  	your purpose(s)

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
Good to see that your site is back on the internet.

<p>
I have been browsing your site now for about a couple of years, and what
you said was a list of essays which basically became and online book has
pretty much become an online encyclopeadia (hate trying to spell that word).

<p>
Like it or not nobody can disagree with the facts that you have done
much excellent research, and have one of the most controversial sites on
the internet today.

<p>
Anyway after reading through many of your essays, introduction,
biography, and letters, I cannot find any place where you mention what
the purpose of The Orange Papers actually is. When Agent Apple had
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.aadeprogramming.com/">www.aadeprogramming.com</a>
her intent was
mentioned right in the introduction, but I cannot see yours anywhere.

<p>
I guess what I am asking is what is your ultimate goal for this rather
large site that you have

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Herb,
<p>
The simple answer is, &quot;To get the truth out there.&quot;
<p>
Just that. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
<p>
In fact, I was thinking about that just recently, and I came to the conclusion
that if I could have just one wish about this whole &quot;recovery industry&quot; or
&quot;recovery community&quot;, it would be for everybody to just tell the truth.
<p>
Not for A.A. to die and disappear, or for some other group to gain ascendency;
just for everybody to tell the truth.
<p>
I think that if everybody told the truth, a lot of problems would disappear by themselves.

<p>
If A.A. told the judges that A.A. is actually a religious social club with a zero-percent
success rate in getting alcoholics to quit drinking, then judges would be very
reluctant to sentence drunk drivers, alcoholics and addicts to 12-Step meetings.
<p>
Likewise, people wouldn't shell out $15,000 or $30,000 for a month of 12-Step religious
indoctrination if the treatment centers honestly told people that was what they were
really going to get for their money. People would be even more reluctant to part with
their money if they knew what the treatment center's real success rate was.

<p>
And people who were seeking some kind of help to quit drinking or drugging could make
better decisions if they were not misinformed by so many propagandists.
<p>
Yes, the truth. That would be nice. Just for a change.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Hi

<p>
when my fiance died i got very little response from my so called AA
friends..... the other day i attended the funeral of a good friend who
was still in AA... i have been unreasonably angry lately..... especially
since the funeral.

<p>
can just seeing old AA people for one day cause all this.?.. i have been
AA free for 17 months.

<p>
Tom

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Tom,
<p>
It's good to hear from you, and I'm sorry that you are feeling poorly,
and going through such painful changes.
<p>
You asked,
<font color="black">
&quot;Can just seeing old AA people for one day cause all this?&quot;
</font>
<p>
Well yeh, dude. You are describing some *very* heavy stuff,
like the deaths of a lover and a friend.
That is bound to cause a lot of intense feelings, no matter what else is going on.
<p>

And feeling like your old A.A. friends didn't really care about your fiance
or really help your other friend
is bound to leave a bitter taste in your mouth.
That's just life. That's just how it is.
<p>

When I get into a mood like that, I do everything I can to just get away
from the negative thoughts, simply because being angry about things that I can't
change does me no good, and is just a waste of energy.

<p>
Like I wrote in another page, in another situation,
<blockquote>
The only real cure is time.
Just hang in there and ride out the storm.<br>
Make sure you take lots of B vitamins.<br>
Also get off of nicotine and caffeine as much as you can.
If you drink coffee, put milk or cream in it
to take the edge off of the caffeine.
(Latt&eacute; Brev&eacute; is good.)<br>
Don't let yourself get too tired or too hungry.<br>
Engage your mind in positive, cheerful things as much as possible.<br>
Listen to good music.<br>
Enjoy life.<br>
Go for long walks in beautiful places.<br>
Things will get better.<br>

Have a good day and a good life.

Subject:  	Narcissistic web site

<p>
Narcissist Orange,

<p>
Wasted at least half an hour on one of your rants that I came across on
the Internet then went to your site and thankfully wasted less time than
that before I chose to write you off.  Before I do so entirely, I would
be curious to know just a few things:

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Chris. Go for it.
</font>
<p>

By virtue of what special training or knowledge, other than your ability
to filch others' research, are you able to dismiss AA as a useless,
hypocritical &quot;cult&quot;?   Are you an M.D.?  Psychotherapist, psychologist,
PhD., or just a self anointed naysayer?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is a demonstration of two propaganda techniques:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>Ad Hominem</i>, Launch Personal Attacks On Opponents</a><br>
If you don't like the message, attack the messenger and attempt to silence him.
&quot;You aren't qualified to speak!&quot;

<li>
Create a diversion. When you don't like the facts, change the subject.<br>
Instead of discussing the issues, discuss your opponent in the debate.
</ol>
<p>
The simple fact is, I can speak the truth without a certificate. I have enough education
to understand what I'm reading when I study those doctor's reports. That's enough.
</font>
<p>
<a name="pass_the_hat"> </a>
Do you now accept donations through Pay Pal?  If so, are you no less
hypocritical and greedy than Bill W. was when he sought royalties from
Big Book sales?  Please don't bother telling me which charity it goes to
unless you're willing to provide copies of your tax returns...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Don't be ridiculous. You are comparing two completely dissimilar things.
That's the propaganda technique called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#apples_to_oranges">Compare Apples To Oranges</a>.
There is no similarity between Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">stealing the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund</a>,
and stealing the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i>, and me accepting contributions.
<p>
Accepting contributions is the same as A.A. passing the hat at meetings, which is
something that I have never criticized or condemned. In fact, I find that to be
one of the more charming aspects of Alcoholics Anonymous. If the A.A. headquarters
would stick to that, instead of
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">committing perjury against A.A. members</a>,
then A.A. would be a more spiritual organization.

<p>
In the cult test, on the item
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_money_grubbing"><i>The Cult is Money-Grubbing</i></a>, I wrote:
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The average A.A. meeting, where they
just pass the hat, does not seem to act like that at all.
A.A. would appear, to the casual observer, to be completely
innocent in this regard, in spite of the fact that Bill Wilson
lectured his fellow alcoholics to put more money into the hat
in his second book, <i>&quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;</i>...
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, in the cult test item
<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_appropriate_wealth"><i>Appropriation of all
of the members' worldly wealth</i></a>, I wrote:
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A. passes the hat at each meeting, and that's all. Since many
people come into A.A. in ragged shape,
fresh out of detox, unemployed and penniless, nobody thinks twice
about someone who doesn't donate.
A.A. even has a seldom-mentioned rule of thumb to the effect of
&quot;you aren't supposed to donate more
than $1000 per year when the basket is passed around.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am not being hypcritical there.
</font>

<p>
While you offer the perfectly valid opinion that AA is not the only
answer (in fact you seem to be calling for nothing less
than its outright abolition as the result of groundswell movement that
you would eventually take responsibility for in a grandiose testament to
you as an avenging angel) and that there are suitable alternatives, I
saw nothing on your site that would boast of their success rates,
membership numbers, endorsements by the AMA or any physicians' group,
etc.   Why is this information not provided?

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is there. You just don't bother to read before exploding.
<p>
Try this:
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a sophisticated controlled
study of A.A.'s effectiveness (Brandsma et. al.)</a>,
court-mandated offenders who had been
sent to Alcoholics Anonymous for several months were engaging in <b><i>FIVE TIMES as
much binge drinking</i></b> as another group of alcoholics who got no
treatment at all, and the A.A. group was doing <b><i>NINE TIMES
as much binge drinking</i></b> as
another group of alcoholics who got rational behavior therapy.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Put another way, the A.A. group was doing more binge drinking than the
no-treatment group, while the rational behavior therapy group was doing
less binge drinking than the no-treatment group.
Follow that link to the study for all of the rest of the numbers.

<p>
And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">this British test of A.A.</a>
where one group got non-stop A.A. and a full-blown
treatment program for a year, while the other group got nothing but a one-hour
lecture from a doctor, telling them to quit drinking or they would die:
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Twelve months after the experiment began, both groups were
assessed.
<font color="#9F0000">
No significant differences were found between the two groups.</font>
Furthermore, drinkers in the treatment group who stayed with it
for the full period did not fare any better than those who
dropped out. At the twelve-month point, only eleven of the
one hundred drinkers had become abstainers.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is printing results.
<p>
Again, follow the links. You really should bother to read the whole file
on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">The Effectiveness of
the 12-Step Treatment</a> before complaining.
</font>
<p>

AA has saved my life.  It has done what other self-help programs and
psychiatrists could not.  I care not that it's founder was not a saint
and possessed character flaws just like every human being.  But I am not
a bigot-I believe there are about as many solutions to addiction as
there are addicts and in fact the Big Book that you so despise pays
tribute to and promotes cooperation with science, medicine,  and
religion,  if not other forms of treatment.  I would think your time
would be better spent promoting these alternatives rather than engaging
in the vitriol which seems to consume you.   For the sake of your
recovery I would hope that you find something more worthwhile than
venting your hatred for all things Bill W. and AA.   Are you happy in
life?  Or has your vendetta made you bitter?

<p>
Chris M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, now that is the crux of the matter, isn't it?<br>
You believe that A.A. saved your life, so you just can't bear to hear any
criticism of it.<br>
Not even if the criticism is true.

<p>
The statement,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;It has done what other self-help programs and
psychiatrists could not.&quot;</i></font>
is obviously baloney.
You quit drinking. Period. A.A. didn't quit drinking for you.

<p>
There is zero evidence that anything A.A. did made you quit drinking.
You are merely
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">confusing causation with correlation</a>.
<p>
It's just like how girls (and their boyfriends)
go to a church where a decrepit old priest mumbles a bunch of words
and then declares that the girls are now married, and the next thing you know, those girls
are all pregnant, so, obviously, that old priest made those girls get pregnant.
<p>
That goofy logic is the same goofy logic as saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I went to an A.A. meeting and then
quit drinking, so A.A. made me quit drinking.&quot;
</font>

<p><br>
You say that you went to some other self-help programs.<br>
Oh really? Which ones? For how long?<br>
When, in your drinking career? What did you learn from them?
<p>
If you say &quot;nothing&quot;, then I will have to caution you to avoid hypocrisy there,
because I routinely hear A.A. members try to claim the credit for the sobriety
of everybody else who ever went to a few A.A. meetings,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Clinton_Street">no matter how many years earlier</a>.
The A.A. members say that those other people &quot;learned something&quot; from going to the
A.A. meetings, and that is what made the drinkers quit drinking months or years later.
<p>
So how do you know that you didn't learn something from those other programs that
eventually helped you to quit drinking later?

<p>
It doesn't seem to occur to you that no program worked until you quit drinking,
and then any program would have &quot;worked for you&quot; after that.
<p>
You just happened to be in A.A. when you finally quit messing around and actually
really finally quit drinking, and then the A.A. members talked you into giving
the credit for your hard work to A.A., and into believing that A.A. somehow
&quot;made you quit drinking&quot;.
<p>
So why didn't you quit drinking earlier? Because you weren't ready to quit yet.<br>
So why didn't you go to A.A. earlier? Because you weren't ready to quit yet.<br>
You had not really decided to quit. You just mumbled about wanting to quit, without
really wanting it.<br>
You sort of thought you wanted to quit drinking, but you didn't want it enough.<br>
When you were finally really ready to quit, when you really wanted it, you did quit.<br>
A.A. involvement was coincidental and irrelevant.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I have been reading your &quot;book&quot; with great interest.  I attend AA
meetings and have been sober for twenty years.  I used to consider
myself a full blown member but I don't really see it that way anymore.
You have obviously done a great deal of research and I commend you for
it.  I have not done the research you have but I'm sure many of the
things that you have written are true.  I used to be fully indoctrinated
with the AA way of doing things but no more.  I used to be a follower of
Bill Wilson but no more.

<p>

I enjoy the people I associate with in AA but I leave most AA's alone
because I do not agree with their character.  I have been off of alcohol
and drugs for twenty years now.  I used to wake up with the conscious
thought that I was an alcoholic but no more.  I used to think of myself
as a sick alcoholic but no more.   I appreciate your website.  It has
really made me think but at this point in time I am not planning to stop
attending meetings because I like them and have made a few good friends
there.  I hope you are doing well in SMART.

Hello Gary,

Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on your sobriety.

The social club is a reason that a lot of people go to A.A. meetings. That's okay.

Hi Marc,

Thanks for the letter. You can spread the word just by continuing to tell

For example, even if I did not exist, the information from A.A. leader
Dr. George Vaillant where he tried for many years to make the A.A. program
work but 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">just found it to be a total failure</a>,

That has nothing to do with me, actually.

I didn't read all of your web page, I found something that was false and
won't waste my time reading garbage.  Whew!  You sure put a lot of stuff
together. I did read until you started making things up and passing them
off as actual program talk.

Either way, it is
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Pharisees">the occult practice that Jesus condemned</a>
as &quot;seeking signs&quot;.

<p>
As Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham (Church of England), said in his
criticism of the Oxford Group practices that became Step 11 in Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Groupism discloses in its conception of 'Guidance' precisely the same error
as that which infects its conception of 'witness'.
<font color="#9F0000">
It 'seeks a sign'.
</font>
It insists on something precise, concrete, calculable.
Its temper of mind is
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Pharisees">rather Pharisaic than Christian</a>.
It seeks proofs of Divine action in what is abnormal, amazing, even miraculous.
Its view of inspiration is mechanical, and its treatment of Scripture
literalist. Thus it comes about that, even in the process of exalting
the genuinely Christian conception of the 'guided life', it perverts
and lowers it.<br>

Wow, that's a lot of stuff to read, you must have a lot of free time on your
hands.  Most people who don't like AA just stop going and forget about it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's true of most cults. Most people do nothing after they quit the cult.
That's how the cults keep on going.
</font>
<p>

I spent a lot of time picking NA apart, it's so easy.  They define an addict
is a man or woman who's life is controlled by drugs.  They define drugs as
any mood or mind altering chemical. Then they talk about how abstinence is
the only way to succeed in life and their program but they serve coffee at
their meetings and even allow smoking at some meetings.  That's two drugs,
caffeine and nicotine.  What's up with that?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, what is up with that? Are you criticizing N.A. just for the fun of it?
What's your point, besides the obvious fact that the N.A. and A.A. position on tobacco
is hypocritical?

&quot;Killing yourself with alcohol or heroin or cocaine is bad. Killing yourself with

Subject:  	The Funny Spirituality of Bill Wilson and A.A.

<p>

Mr. &quot;Orange,&quot;
<p>
I recently quit drinking and attended AA meetings w/ an old friend for
about two
months. I too came to the conclusion that it was a religious cult or sect.
I found the meetings highly entertaining for a while, and the writing of
Wilson
laughably bad. Needless to say, I stopped attending the meetings &#8212; after
failing
to find inspiration to write an assignment re: step 2, my &quot;sponsor:
stopped calling me.

<p>

I am impressed, intrigued and entertained by the info on your site. I am
curious to know how and why you became motivated to compile such a
database of info.
I imagine there are some interesting experiences/ motivations behind all
of your hard work and research.

<p>
By the way, I am still sober. One of my main complaints about the cult
of AA is how the members
seem to dwell on the topic of alcohol constantly, this probably
contributes to the relapse and binging
your research describes.

<p>
Thanks for an informative and entertaining web site.
<p>

Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on your sobriety.

<p>
The &quot;why&quot; is partially explained in these three items:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">Intro to A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">Bait-and-switch treatment</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">Friends driven away from help by the 12-step nonsense</a>
</ol>

<p>
And another funny aspect of this web site is that I never intended to do it.
As I recently explained in
<a href="orange-letters25.html#motivation4creating">an earlier letter</a>,
I started off intending to write just one paper that explained my objections to using
A.A. as &quot;treatment&quot; for alcoholism. One thing led to another and it turned into
an online book and a web site.

<p>
(The funny thing is, that's how my drinking started too &#8212; just a little bit, just one beer after work
each night, gradually growing into a huge monster.)
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Quick Thoughts<br>

<p>
I have not read most of your website yet, but will keep reading it
regularly. Without question it is a negative campaign, basically to
trash A.A. and its founders. Since I have been sober in A.A.
continuously since February 16th, 1990, I take offense to your
condescending attitude and verbiage towards the fellowship.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety. So you have figured out that I want to discredit
Alcoholics Anonymous? Well yes, for a lot of good reasons.
</font>
<p>

As a matter of fact, following your rational, I shouldn't be American
either, just think of the womanizing Clinton and Kennedy did. The racism
and slavery. I guess every religion would be a hoax too because somebody
is profiting, and on and on and on. So why belong to anything?
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is an absurd nonsensical argument. You are just trying to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimize and deny</a> and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#rationalize">rationalize away</a>
all of the faults of Alcoholics Anonymous by implying that nobody is perfect.
<i>Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.</i>
<p>
By the way, we ended slavery almost 150 years ago. When is A.A. going to change its ways?
</font>

<p>
Lets all cloak ourselves under some Captain America name, hide behind a computer
and proceed to look for 'facts and support' of our paranoid theories'
What you are doing works with anything, including the other recovery
sites you are referencing. Heck, I could even nit-pick and argue and go
to war with every sentence on your site, I will leave that to my sicker
brother here (you).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Do you have any actual facts to back up your accusations?
I deal in facts, and Steppers do not.
How about some specifics, instead of vague sweeping generalities?
<p>
Again, you are trying to dismiss all criticism of A.A. without even dealing with any
specifics. Telling precisely what is wrong with A.A. is not &quot;nit-picking&quot;.
If you think I am wrong about some point, please tell exactly what the line is, from
what page, and then say what you think the truth is, and back it up with a bunch
of references from valid sources or reliable authorities (like the Harvard Medical School).
</font>
<p>

By the way, my spirituality is a simple tool to help me cope with life.
It is Direction. Hope. Purpose.  No hocus pocus, look-at-me-I-am-special
God, Cults or anything like that. (Which you are desperately trying to
turn it into) A.A. has kept its promise and allowed me to seek a God of
my understanding.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So far, all I've seen of your &quot;spirituality&quot; is hatred and anger. Or do you keep your
&quot;spirituality&quot; in a box, to be pulled out only when convenient,
and to be given to only the &quot;right&quot; people?
</font>
<p>
I came to A.A. at 23 yrs. old living off blood banks, dope deals and
soup lines, today I am a nationally registered architect.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your recovery. It is wonderful that you finally decided to
quit committing suicide and do something better with your life.
<p>
There is no evidence that any 12-Step cult had anything to do with your decision
to save your own life, or your successful exercising of your will to live.
</font>
<p>

Oh by the way, since I've been in A.A. I have gotten a piece of ass or
two also. (Horrible, isn't it? I suggest you immediately use it against
me. That's obviously the type of pious you are)

<p>
<font color="blue">
The question is,
<ol>
<li>
&quot;Did you seduce sick women by pretending to
offer them help in overcoming their addictions?&quot; (Bill Wilson did.)
<p>
<li>
Also, &quot;Did you use your status as an old-timer in the group to have
an advantage over her?&quot; (<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">Bill Wilson did</a>.)
<p>
<li>
And, &quot;Did you use the A.A. headquarters office as an employment
agency to support your stable of mistresses?&quot;
(Bill Wilson did.)
<p>
<li>
And were you cheating on your wife when you had those affairs? (Bill Wilson was.)
<p>
<li>
And did you take two women to an A.A. meeting and fondle them all through the meeting,
to show the other guys what a super-stud you were?
(<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#two_women">Bill Wilson did</a>.)
<p>
<li>
And did you yammer about God and spirituality while doing all of that, and claim that
you were so much better than the other alcoholics and addicts, who just couldn't
handle your lofty level of spirituality and practice the Four Absolutes like you could?
Did you hypocritically declare that your fellow alcoholics and addicts
just didn't want to get too good too soon?
(<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#too_good">Bill Wilson did</a>.)
</ol>

<p>
I don't think your claimed behavior quite rises to Bill Wilson's level
of immorality, criminality, and hypocrisy.
</font>
<p>

Tell you what, I will give you space to grow the fuck up, space you are
not giving members of A.A.

<p>
Thanks anyway, slick.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And thank you for your 12-Step spirituality.

Have a good day anyway.

<p>

Hey Slick,

<p>

I just think it is so funny that YOU are telling ME what A.A. has done
or not done for MY recovery. And you call Bill Wilson grandiose. Ha Ha

<p>
<font color="blue">
What on earth are you talking about?
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION: On re-reading that, I do know what you are talking about. It is easy to determine whether a program
is helping people to recover. Just look at the success rate. With
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A.'s zero-percent improvement in the sobriety of people who go to A.A.</a>,
it is easy to determine how much A.A. is helping people &#8212; even the
true believers who insist that A.A. saved their lives.
</font>
<p>
Oh, that's right. We in A.A. are a bunch of mindless, loser clones that
need the genius of Agent Orange to enlighten us with the &quot;TRUTH&quot; to set
our minds free.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are losing it. Are you off of your meds?
</font>
<p>

I am beginning to think maybe you are what you so despise. Oh, Again I
forgot &#8212; you do it for all the right reasons, Bill Wilson did it all for
ego.

<p>

I have been in A.A. 15 years and am not nearly as brainwashed as you.I
rarely even give Bill Wilson any thought. However, Bill Wilson owns you.

<p>

You can stop meditating on Bill Wilson and A.A. anytime now. May I
suggest a real Higher Power? Ha Ha

<p>

I happen to have a life and career beyond arguing about A.A.- I have
nothing to prove, my life and recovery speaks for itself. If you say
that I am angry and not spiritual because of 2 paragraphs I wrote you,
well then you must be completely loon after what all you?ve been up to
on your website!

<p>

And concerning all your essays on God, Character Defects, Anger,
Confession, Smoking- YOU JUST DON?T GET IT, SLICK!

<p>

And yes, to self destruct is a mental illness, the problem does center
in the mind, and yes, you are a great example of insanity!

<p>

I do find your web site &quot;funny&quot;.

Funny, there were no solutions that you had to offer on that collection
of negativity you call a website. AA has worked for millions, I assume
by your bitterness it didn't work for you. Too bad. Did it occur to you
the problem may not be with the millions of &quot;cult members&quot; but the one
so full of bile that he/she feels compulsed to commit a website to it?

<p>
Do you think you are helping anyone with your information?

<p>
mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Well, actually, yes. At least, I get enough emails that tell me that somebody else
feels that they were helped by hearing the truth.
<p>
Your assumption that I am &quot;bitter&quot; because &quot;it didn't work for me&quot; is wrong.
I never worked the A.A. program. I never did the Twelve Steps, I never had an A.A. sponsor,
I didn't go to 12-Step meetings for very long,
and I never believed in Bill Wilson or his &quot;Big Book&quot;.
I figured out pretty quickly that it was a stupid cult, and walked out.
Nevertheless, I have 5 years of sobriety now, mostly by the do-it-yourself program, with
maybe a little help from SMART and
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">AVRT</a>.
So *MY* program is working great, and I have no reason to be &quot;bitter&quot; about it.

<p>
If I am &quot;bitter&quot; about anything, it is from watching friends and acquaintances
die while A.A. and N.A. totally failed to be of any help to them.
And then listening to the true believers continue to
mindlessly parrot &quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;, which is grossly dishonest.
<p>
When you claim that &quot;AA has worked for millions&quot;, please explain your numbers.
A.A. is great at making sweeping unsubstantiated claims like that, but those claims fall apart
when exposed to glaring daylight.

<p>
What a leader of A.A. found was that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">A.A. had a zero-percent success rate</a>, above normal
spontaneous remission. And he &#8212; Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant, a member of the Board of
Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., &#8212; was trying hard to make A.A.
look good. Vaillant loves A.A. and thinks that everybody should get shoved into the
religion so that they can &quot;get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status
healer.&quot; Nevertheless, Vaillant had to admit that after nearly 20 years of shoving A.A.
on his alcoholic patients, that A.A. didn't work at all, and that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">its death rate was appalling</a> &#8212;
higher than any other treatment program.

<p>
So when you parrot the standard A.A. propaganda that &quot;AA has worked
for millions&quot;, please explain where you get your numbers.
<p>
Oh, and watch out for switcheroos. The A.A. headquarters often claims that it has 2 million members
world-wide (including duplicates, which can't be eliminated because everybody is anonymous).
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">But that isn't the same
 thing as 2 million <i>*sober members*</i></a>.
There is no evidence that they are all sober, and A.A. is careful to not release data that will
allow us to figure out exactly how many of them are sober.
The best we get is some percentages of the good members who fill out triennial surveys, which
is a very different thing. Remember that a large percentage of the claimed membership
is just people who are temporarily going to meetings, and who will soon drop out.

<p>
And most important of all is the false assumption that &quot;A.A. works&quot;.
Just because some people quit drinking while attending a few A.A. meetings
does not mean that
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">A.A. caused them to quit drinking</a>.
Many millions more quit drinking without A.A..

<p>
Most of the people who go to A.A. meetings
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">don't quit drinking</a>.<br>
Most of the people who quit drinking
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">don't go to A.A. meetings</a>.
<p>

People do just grow out of it. People come to their senses and decide
that they would rather not die that way, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">they just quit drinking</a>.
They get sick and tired of being sick and tired, so they quit drinking.
(I am one of those people.)
<p>
A.A. simply falsely claims the credit for all of the cases of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">spontaneous remission from alcohol misuse</a>
that happen anywhere in the neighborhood of a meeting.
But all of the supposed A.A. success stories can be explained in terms
of normal spontaneous remission.
If you subtract the normal 5% rate of spontaneous remission from the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">claimed A.A. success rate of 5%</a>,
you get zero, which is the real A.A. success rate.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
Oh, and I have often talked about what else works. I have especially talked about
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.smartrecovery.org/">SMART</a>,
which is based on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</a>,
and about Addictive Voice Recognition Therapy,
which is
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">learning to recognize and fight the
&quot;addictive voice&quot;</a>.

I also often mention <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.sossobriety.org/">SOS</a>,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.womenforsobriety.org/">Women For Sobriety (WFS)</a>,
and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.unhooked.com/index.htm">LifeRing</a>.

And then there is the most successful program in the world,

<p>
Hi,
<p>
I have just been reading your website. There is one error repeated in a few
places. L. Ron Hubbard didn't die of cancer. Some believed he had
pancreatitis &#8212; from heavy drinking most of his life. He was 74 years old. Here is an
overall account:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.xenu.net/archive/hubbardcoroner/">
http://www.xenu.net/archive/hubbardcoroner/</a>

<p>
The death certificate (linked on that page) said &quot;cerebral vascular
accident.&quot;

<p>
And an LA Times article:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221909/http://www.lermanet2.com/scientologynews/latimes/lat-1d.htm">
http://www.lermanet2.com/scientologynews/latimes/lat-1d.htm</a><br>

On or about Jan. 17, 1986, Hubbard suffered a &quot;cerebral vascular accident,&quot;
commonly known as a stroke. Caring for him was Gene Denk, a Scientologist
doctor and Hubbard's physician for eight years.

<p>
There was little Denk could do for Hubbard in those final days &#8212; the stroke
was debilitating. He was bedridden and his speech was badly impaired.

<p>
One week later, at 8 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 24, Hubbard died.

<p>
I am so glad I found your website. I am having to attend AA meetings
because of a DUI. I just want to cringe when I have to attend them. I
knew I wasn't in denial, but that many things just weren't right. It is
a religious cult. Bill Wilson is the co-founder , which would be the
same thing as a pastor in a church. The 12 Steps would be the same thing
as the 10 Commandments.  The Big Book is the same as the Bible. They say
it is spiritual not religious. It's so obvious it's religious by reading
the 12 Steps. I also don't like it because it brainwashes people into
believing they are powerless. If we are powerless, then we are victims
and victims stay victims because it's never their fault. Their
misfortunes are always someone elses fault. Therefore, they don't have
the power to change it. AA just wants us to brainlessly accept the steps
and continue to go to AA meetings for the rest of our lives in order to
maintain sobriety. I think when God gave us a brain, he intended for us
to use it. I have so much more to say, but am pressed for time at the
moment.

Hi Larry,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That's an easy question. The young Rev. Frank Buchman was
running a hospice for homeless boys and young men in Philadelphia. He got
into a squabble over money with his board of trustees. He threw a temper tantrum
and resigned in a huff and got on a boat for Europe (going vacationing on his father's money).
<p>
The way that the Buchmanites have rewritten history, they would have it that the
trustees wanted to starve the poor boys to death, and Frank wouldn't stand for it.
That is highly doubtful. (And so how did Frank's resignation feed the boys?)
<p>
Then, the story says, Frank felt twangs of guilt over his behavior, and repented
in a church service in Keswick, England, and had a conversion experience there.
<p>
There is more on that incident in my
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#Philadelphia">history of the Oxford Group, here</a>.
<p>
Enjoy, and have a good day.

Did they reinstate your page at any time?  It doesn't sound like it.  I
think it is the paranoid climate of the times that is seriously
endangering free speech.  Agree with the majority or be summarily
silenced.

<p>
Keep up the good work and don't let the b*stards win!  Excellent site.

Hi Dreamwalker,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
No, I never got anything out of Yahoo, not even my email.
They just sent a form letter and that was the end of that. No explanation, no apologies, no nuthin.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear A.O.

<p>
I have enjoyed your website. It makes me feel like I'm not crazy for not
&quot;surrendering&quot; to the mind-numbing BS of AA.

<p>
Once again, thank you.<br>

Hi Greg,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. You help me to believe that
I haven't gone off of the deep end, too.

Have a good day.

Subject:  	are you the one who wrote this? Are you an alcoholic ?

Yes, that is my work, and yes, I am an alcoholic.
<p>
But please, watch out for the definitions of the word
&quot;alcoholic&quot;.

<p>
A.A. uses three very different definitions of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;, and
freely uses them interchangeably:

<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol, almost
allergic to alcohol, perhaps a genetic alcoholic; someone who cannot
drink even one drink or his drinking will spin out of control and he
will become readdicted to alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is an insane sinner who is full of disgusting character
defects and moral shortcomings and resentments and barely-contained
anger, and is a prime example of self-will run riot and instincts run
wild and selfishness and self-seeking and the Seven Deadly Sins,
although he doesn't think so... etc., etc., ...
</ol>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
By definition 1, I stopped being an alcoholic five years ago.
<li>
By definition 2, I will always be an alcoholic.
<li>
By definition 3, I was never an alcoholic. I was always a nice
drunk. People liked having me at their parties because I was so much
fun to have around when I got high. (But, as one friend said, &quot;Even
nice drunks die of cirrhosis of the liver...&quot;)
</ol>

<p>
Have a good day.

<blockquote>
<font face="Courier,Swiss,Helvetica">
So how does A.A. score as a cult? On a scale of zero to ten, where zero
means that it isn't like a cult at all, and ten means that A.A. is really
like a cult, I score A.A. like this: (Feel free to grab a piece of paper,
and make up your own scores. It isn't like I own a monopoly on the truth, or
anything...)
</font>

<p>
I do not think AA is a cult what so ever but of course water rises to it's
own level.

Hi Gary,
<p>
You didn't bother to actually read the Cult Test, and score A.A. on that test, did you?
<p>
When I said, &quot;Feel free to grab a piece of paper,
and make up your own scores,&quot; I meant, &quot;Read the test, and write down
your scores for A.A. on your piece of paper.&quot;
<p>
All you have done is reacted without thinking.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A.A. a cult? Oh God no! It can't be, because I'm
a member of A.A., and I like A.A., so A.A. can't be a cult.&quot;<br>
</font>
That is not logical, to put it mildly.

<p>
Then you say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;but of course water rises to it's own level.&quot;<br>
</font>
What on earth is that slogan supposed to mean?<br>
You could just as easily say, &quot;Mud sinks to its own level.&quot;

<p>
So why don't you grab a piece of paper, and read the questions, and read
my answers, and make up your own scores, based on your own best judgement,
and then send me your scores?
(Please be &quot;rigorously honest&quot; &#8212; <i>Big Book</i>, page 58.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

get  a publisher as soon as possible.

this is a treatise of importance.

good day

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jack,
<p>
Thanks for the flattering comment. Alas, I am reluctant to think about publishing on paper.
Paper is like so &quot;dead-tree-ish&quot;. The links don't work. You can't cross-reference things easily.
Color printing is expensive. Updates are impossible.
<p>
In a real sense, my book is already published, on the web. I advise people to download the archive
files, so that they have the entire web site, and then just burn CDs for themselves and their
friends.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	In favor of your Anti-AA Web site

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,
<p>
I am enthralled over your collection of material, which I have been able to
look over only briefly. I appreciate it because it tells me that the
impressions I was getting and the disgust I was feeling over certain
portions of AA lore and the Big Book were correct impressions. I am
cognitively impaired because of brain damage; though I am still smart enough
to know what I am reading, I am not fast or astute enough to put my finger
on what the issues are. Your Web site does that for me.
<p>
Great job.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Patricia S.

<p>
(I am not the addicted individual; I know the person who is, and have heard
many of these AA excuses, especially the ones that Bill W. used to justify
his 13th-stepping and to belittle his wife's attitude.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Patricia,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that somebody benefits from
all of this.
<p>
Have a good day.

 I have a husband at Hazelden right now.  I thought I was the only one
 thinking this stuff...  It is his second round of rehab there &#8212; he wanted to
 go back after he relapsed &#8212; I thought we should ask for our money back.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, really. Funny how they never give out refunds, or money-back
guarantees...

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

To the other readers: Hazelden charges $15,000 for a 28-day stay, during which the
major thrust is indoctrination in the 12 Steps. That guy shelled out $30,000 to
have the 12-Step cult religion taught to him.]
