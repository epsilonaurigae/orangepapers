You are hilarious... at first I actually thought you were serious with those
jealous, juvenile resentful ranting's. Having been sucked in by your deluded dribble
about Alcoholic Anonymous, I finally got it! You are a very psychologically funny
man... sociologically dangerous... but quite funny nevertheless! It's been brought
to my attention, when individual human growth is so apparently stunted and crippled
by resentment, one is spiritually isolated in a world that remains flat! I wonder,
is this true?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jjaliii,
<p>
You are assuming that someone objecting to the crime of foisting quack medicine on
sick people is a &quot;resentment&quot; that will prevent someone from being &quot;spiritual&quot;,
a belief for which there is not a shred of supporting evidence in the holy books of
any major religion.
I suggest that just the opposite is true: If you won't clean your house,
and fix what is wrong, and especially tell the whole truth to the sick people,
then your activities are not spiritual.

Have a good day now.

hey orange,
<p>
sorry about the second post.. I just have a quick question.. Do you have
any facts on nalextrone and the sinclair method?? I have heard that it is a pill that
cures alcoholism and that the treatment industry is trying to squash it in the
u.s., but it has had great success in Finland.. That would kind of make AA and the 12
steps kind of obsolete..
<p>
Well have a good day Orange..

Ok one more letter..
<p>
im a night shift worker and that leaves me a lot of time to
think.. the reason i was asking about the sinclair method is this.. I suffer from ptsd
depression and to be quite honest, loneliness. loneliness being the worst.. One of my
favorite things to do is get together with other guys and fraternize. That is what
keeps drawing me back to AA every time i sober up. The thing is they are all crazy
and just can't seem to be guys.. Now the thought of being sober forever doesn't
bother me so much as the thought of being stuck hanging with crazy womanizing
fanatics. If there were a pill that i could take that would allow me to hang at the
pub with the boys and have a few beers once in a while, I would be all over it. Bill
W. called it the great obsession of every alcoholic to drink like other men. But he
made that seem like a bad thing.. what option did he leave us.. Be alone or hang out
in church basements with a bunch of assholes.. now that really
bothers me.. Anyways Orange thanks for the ear.. I would love to read your thoughts
on these letters.. If you think Im just nuts, Ill take your word..

Have a good day..<br>

hey orange, me again..
<p>
I couldn't resist and spent a few hours on the internet looking
into this sinclair method using naltrexone. Now I am no expert and dont have the
proper data that you seem to be so skilled in gathering. But here's what I have
gathered. It seems the scientific studies show that when nalextrone is taken one hour
before drinking people who normally cant control their drinking gradually unlearn
that behavior. The percentages very but it seems that of the people who comply, which
is around 80 percent, 75 percent are still moderating their drinking within safe
limits after one year. For some reason the other 25 percent decide to just quit with
no withdrawl symptoms.. Again, I am not skilled at interpreting data or even knowing
how to tell if it is legit.. But, what I am seeing is a method that when followed
seems to have a 100 percent success rate as a moderation program and  a  25 percent
side effect of  quitting drinking.. If these studies are
true, as you know, blows AA's results out of the water.. It also seems to me that the
only critics are AA believers, and that doctors are afraid to get behind it in the
U.S. because they have been unwittingly recruiting for AA for so long that they
really think Aa is the only way.. also it seems the pharm. industry stands to lose or
not make alot of money off sick addicts anymore and are interfering with research
of this sinclair guy.. Anyways, myself, I am gonna try to get my hands on some of this
stuff and do my own personal research.. Thanks again for the ear, looking forward to
your response..

Hello again, Lewie,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer these letters. I figured out what happened. You sent
four letters at nearly the same time, and after I answered the first one, I issued a command
to move everything whose file name contained &quot;*Lewis*&quot; into the &quot;done&quot; folder. (That is a
Unix/Linux command.) And your other letters got moved too, and I didn't notice that. So they
got overlooked and forgotten. But now I have found them.

<p>
That Sinclair Method sure looks interesting. I've just started reading up on it myself. I don't
really know anything more about it than you do.
So let me make that disclaimer right away.
<p>

http://www.thesinclairmethod.net/community/</a>
== this is a forum where people talk about the Sinclair Method and give testimonials, and also
ask questions.

<p><li>
You can find a zillion more links by using Google and doing a search for &quot;Sinclair Method&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
The basic idea is that an alcoholic takes a pill that is a short-term opioid antagonist.
That means that for a short period of time, opiates and opiate-like chemicals won't work, and
can't get you high (or kill your pain, either, I guess).
That would block beta endorphins, our bodies' natural pain-killers, from working.
And it apparently also blocks dopamine, which is our natural &quot;feel-good&quot; chemical, which
alcohol intoxication causes to be released in larger quantities.
<p>
The patients can keep right on drinking, same as usual, while they take this pill.
<p>
So you take this pill, and suddenly, alcohol is no big deal any more. You sort of feel its
effects, but you aren't really getting high.
And people eventually loose interest in alcohol because it isn't getting them high any more.

<p>
In theory, it sounds like it could help a lot of people. They claim a very high success rate, like
up to 70%. Right away that makes me suspicious, because that is what the quacks at the 12-Step
treatment centers claim, too. Nevertheless, it could be true. I really want to see some
good, properly-done
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>
to test how well it works.

<p>
We could even have the National Institutes for Health do a big seven-way test, to settle
things for once and for all.  Get a whole bunch of alcoholics from somewhere, and give them
one of seven treatments, selected randomly:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous, a.k.a. &quot;12-Step Facilitation&quot;
<li> SMART
<li> SOS and/or Lifering
<li> Brief Intervention
<li> Motivational Enhancement
<li> Sinclair Method
<li> Nothing. This is the control group.
</ol>

Then see what really produces an increase in sobriety. And see what raises the rate of binge drinking,
and raises the death rate, and raises the rate of rearrests...  And employment or unemployment.
And cost of hospitalizations.
And divorce. And mental health. Heck, count everything, and see what is really happening there.
<p>
That test is not a joke. You might want to write to your Senators and Congressman (or Congresswoman)
and suggest this test as a project for some government-run agency in the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, like perhaps the NIH, or NIMH, the National Institute for Mental Health, or
NIDA, the National Institute of Drug Abuse.

<p>
The Steppers will of course object to such a test, and fight it tooth and nail. They will especially
scream about having a control group. They managed to keep
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH" target="_blank">Project MATCH</a>
from having a control group, and they will try to prevent it here too.
A control group will reveal that some methods, like A.A. and &quot;12-Step Facilitation&quot;,
have the same success rate as &quot;no treatment&quot;.
The Steppers sure don't want that result, so they will argue that it is &quot;unethical&quot; to give
&quot;no treatment&quot; to a group of alcoholics. But they argue from a viewpoint of assuming that
shoving 12-Step theology on alcoholics helps them and saves them from death, which it does not.
All of the properly-done tests show that giving more 12-Step treatment to alcoholics is what is
unethical.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">It kills them</a>.

<p>
Still, the biggest problem I see with the Sinclair Method is people not taking the pills.
That is the same problem as with any pill-oriented cure or therapy. The alcoholic must sincerely
want to quit, or all bets are off. It is too easy to just not take the pill.

<p>
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">My Lizard Brain</a>
has already given his answer. As soon as I read those pages that
are linked above, and one page quoted a guy saying, &quot;It takes the magic out of drinking,&quot;
my Lizard Brain said,
<font color="#7F0000">
&quot;You say this stuff (Naltrexone) takes the fun out
of drinking? It takes the magic out of it?
It keeps you from feeling that grand ecstatic rush when you are heading for Cloud Nine?
It makes drinking uneventful and boring? The heck with that noise. Let's just sort of forget to
take the pill today so that we can feel great tonight. That will be okay. I don't need to take the
pill every day, do I? I'll take it tomorrow, and have a good time tonight.
Besides, we are in a lot of pain, and we need the pain-killer effect tonight.&quot;
</font>

<p>
And old Lizard Brain will do that, too. He is moronically stupid about a lot of things, but he's
pretty darned clever when it comes to figuring out how to get high.

<p>
So we still need to be 100% convinced that we want to quit alcohol, and not get high on it any more,
and 100% determined,
or else the scheming little Lizard Brain will find a way around a simple obstacle like a pill.
<p>
At least, that is true of a hard-core genetic alcoholic like me.
Somebody who just had &quot;a drinking problem&quot;, and who can
successfully taper off into moderate controlled drinking,
may benefit greatly from this method. It sure bears examination.
I want to see some good tests.
<p>
Even if it only works on half of the alcoholics, that would be millions of lives saved.

<p>
And yes, I'm sure that the Steppers will fight this thing tooth and nail. There goes their
bread and butter. A lot of those
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">&quot;drug and alcohol counselor&quot; fools</a>
have absolutely nothing to sell except their goofy cult religion slogans.
And there goes their religion. 
God won't be very pleased if everybody stops groveling and confessing,
and &quot;seeking and doing the Will of God&quot;, and just takes pills,
now will He? So they will scream that the new treatment is killing people
by depriving them of the &quot;traditional, proven method&quot; that
everybody is using.
<p>
And then they will probably find one person who died while trying the
Sinclair Method, and make a well-publicized poster child out of him,
and claim that Sinclair killed him, while ignoring the tens or hundreds of
thousands of others who died while getting &quot;12-Step treatment&quot;.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange,

Thought of only one example that hadn't been mentioned, Murder She Wrote in which

Numerous celebs had audio tapes, among them, Anthony Hopkins and John Laroquette.

I disagree with The Sopranos as an example of AA promotion.  David Chase parodied

Hi Agent Orange,

<p>
This is what I remember AA -AlAnon prmoting in films/ TV shows:

<p>
* When a man loves a woman  1994

<p>
Popular actress Meg Ryan, who plays Alice Green, a school counselor who has a
serious drinking problem. Her husband is Michael (Andy Garcia), an airline pilot.
Though she's lighthearted and loving, Alice is often reckless and, when drunk, even
neglects her children, nine-year-old daughter Jess (Tina Majorino) from a previous
marriage, and four-year-old daughter Casey (Mae Whitman), whose father is Michael.
After an accident, Alice realizes that she has &quot;hit bottom&quot; and goes into a clinic
for rehab.

<p>
* Desperate housewives

<p>
Bree goes to AA

<p>
* Prison Break

<p>
Thers is a scene where an important clue is hidden and found through the Big Book of
AA .
Can't remember which season/episode

<p>
And i want to mention that  in Harlan Cobens novel CAUGHT  i read for the first time
negative things about AA. Somebody killed while DUI and tried to ninth step, but

dear sir:
<p>
  i found your website fascinating.  my story is too lengthy too relate
here, but i began going to aa about a year ago and i suppose, therefore, that i  can
be counted as one of those who &quot;may make it.&quot;  i do have problems with the twelve
steps, because,  like you, i siply do not believe a lot of it.  however, i would
also say that they may have great utility for many people, particularly those with
dependent personalties ( you and i, obviously, do not have that burden) and
therefore, they cannot simply be dismissed out of hand.  there is another website
that concerns some work the government of ontario has done in this matter and they
concur with you that aa makes no difference in suicide rates, but that unemployment
and type of alcohol consumed, do.  you are doubtless very familiar with all  this
work.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. But alas, you give me too much credit.
I don't really know everything. Specifically, I have not read that Canadian research.
I'll have to check it out. (The name of the report, or of the authors, would help
immensely.)
</font>
<p>
  i would not be so harsh as to say aa has harmed me because, in the year i
have gone to an edmonton, alberta, chapter, i have learned, at every meeting almost,
some little &quot;trick,&quot; so to speak, to help me stay sober.  for instance, at today's
meeting, a woman stood and said that she did not want to play russian roulette,
anymore, with alcohol:  i know this sounds terribly  trite but it struck a chord
with me, because i have so far entertained this idea that i will one day be able to
return to responsible drinking, something i really want to believe, is not
delusional thinking.  but it is.  you see, i would never have thought up that simple
little phrase alone, doing  it by myself.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I quite agree that people getting together and sharing advice and experiences can help
in recovery. I have said several times in the past that if you took A.A., and dumped the
12 Steps, and dumped Bill Wilson's crazy religious dogma, and dumped the untrue teachings
about alcoholism, you might end up with a nice social club that could be helpful
to alcoholics.  In fact, SMART meetings also have a period of time where people
share their victories and talk about what is working for them. I've never been to an SOS
or Lifering meeting, but I would guess that they do it too.
The problem I have with A.A. is that the harm that the bad teachings do is often much
greater than the help that people get.

</font>
<p>
   people tell me i am  quite a bright man,
i practised medicine  in the tropics and my  native canada until alcohol abuse
forced me out about two years ago at the age of  58.    the reason i have read your
voluminous and exhausting material, is that several members in edmonton have stood
up  and spoke of suicide in aa over the past few weeks.  my interest was piqued &#8212; i
thought aa was a panacea for that, but obviously, it is not.

&#8212; leading to suicide when seriously-ill people go unmedicated.

<p><li> Chronically depressed patients finding that A.A. makes them worse, not better. The whole
confession and guilt tripping and fault-finding routine of Steps Four through Nine is very
depressing. Some people conclude that they are so bad that the situation is hopeless
and they might as well end it.

<p><li> People wait for years and years for
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises" target="_blank">The Promises</a>&quot;
to come true. And when they don't, they
become very despondent. Just recently, someone wrote to me about
&quot;<a href="orange-letters175.html#hump" target="_blank">the Twenty-Year Hump</a>&quot;, where
people who get 20 years of sobriety in A.A. commit suicide. 
I guess that it's because they realize that if they have
not found happiness from the 12 Steps in 20 years, then they never are going to get it.

<p><li>
Then there is just the whole negative slant of A.A. It's all about your faults, and your moral
shortcomings, and your defects of character, and what you did wrong, and how stupid you
were to drink, and how your aren't qualified to run your own life,
and on and on...  And Step 10 says that you have to continue talking about
when you are wrong for the rest of your life.  Nowhere in the Steps does it tell you to love
or be happy. Where is the joy?
<p>
Now I know about all of the laughter at A.A. meetings. But somehow that rings a little hollow.
It sometimes sounds like someone whistling past a graveyard.

<p><li>
And then there is something that I would call &quot;the fa&ccedil;ade cracking&quot;.
The true believers spend many years parrotting all of the A.A. mythology
and falsified history, and defending A.A., and declaring that A.A. is the biggest and best
self-help group in the world...
<p>
But what if the truth starts to creep into their minds?
What if they begin to notice the attrition rate, and the real failure rate, and
how few newcomers really get helped, year after year?
What if they learn about the real history of A.A., and cannot deny it any longer?
What if they also notice the suicide rate?
If the true believers have devoted their whole lives to A.A., then their whole world
is crumbling. Their reality is going down like skyscrapers in an earthquake.
Some just can't handle it. They have nothing else to fall back on.

<p>
Every so often, one of those true believers gets especially nasty and vicious in attacking
me for telling some undesired truths about Alcoholics Anonymous. I know that is what is
going on there &#8212; the true believers feel like I am destroying their world.
They are fighting for their lives.

<p>
But what if the world of one of those obsessed people does crumble?
It seems like, for some of them, suicide is the answer.

</ul>

<p>
what you are doing is
a labor of love and please continue to do it.  but always understand that some
people, even bright  people, even   people who, like me, have never in life relied
on anybody for guidance,  seem to derive  benefit from an organization  for which
there is really no hard scietific proof.   please pardon my lack of paragraphing.

Thanks for the compliments. Again, I know that some people derive some benefit from
talking to others who are going through the same thing.
But we can do far better than A.A. You can go to SMART, or Lifering,
or SOS, and women to WFS, and talk there, without getting all of the goofy cult religion
dogma and wrong ideas and misinformation and untrue mythology and falsified history.
I'm sure that can help even more. You can even talk about scientific reports and
medical studies that do not praise A.A.

I saw you answered my email (I'd sent one about some nutcases on the James

trying to argue that AA was not religious &#8212; they got pwned, in the manner of

reply &#8212; and for posting the reply, since I am quite sure more than one of
those diehards read your response.

<p>

Hi Alfred,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks, and you are welcome.
</font>
<p>
How's your summer been?  All settled in your (relatively new) home? &#8212; I know
it's been a long struggle.  As I've been reading The Orange Papers for
several years now, for a while there it had seemed as if you dropped off the
face of the earth &#8212; or died, or something equally tragic.

<p>
I see now that it actually was something tragic (homelessness) &#8212; am quite
glad life appears once again to be treating you kindly.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Happily, nothing tragic happened at all. Just an inconvenience. But it really did work
out for the best, because, even though it took about ten times longer than I thought
it would, I found a better place to live. I might have dawdled and not moved for years
more if things had not come to a head. But things did, so now I'm out in the boondocks
with a whole lot of trees around me. This environment just feels so much better than
all of the concrete and glass and steel downtown. And mind you, Portland is one of the
nicest cities I've seen, as cities go, but this is better. At least, for me.
So not tragic at all.
</font>
<p>
Feel free to drop a line every now and then if you want to chat, I'd be more
than glad  to reply on any subject you might wish to converse in (my
favorites?  As of late, that would be the book 'misquoting jesus' by Bart
Ehrman &#8212; an excellent read for anyone interested in debunking religious
fervor over the bible).
<p>
    In closing I wanted to say I am pleased you
discovered a nice semi-rural place to live &#8212; with trees!! Here, we live out
in the desert of California (still 92F at 830pm!), which is great during the
winter, but the lack of greenery &amp; water makes for a somewhat bland living
experience.

<p>
Have a great evening!

Oh yes, Southern California. I lived in Riverside for many years, a long time ago,
and also in the Mojave Desert. It had its own kind of beauty, but was definitely short
on trees and water.

I'll have to check out that book.

<p>
Hi,

<p>
My partner Tracey is an alcoholic. Having been through detox once before and now
desperately waiting for her next date for an available bed in hospital, she was
seriously considering AA. Having researched AA recovery rates in the past as part of
my Social Sciences Degree, I tried to convince her that this wasn't a good idea.
As she sat beside me while I typed in AA on the internet, we found your excellently
written series of articles and my point was proved. She's now going to wait for her
hospital detox treatment and we'll take it from there together. Tracey's a fine
lady, who suffers from low self esteem, depression and ulcerative colitus, a
degenerative illness. It was the pain that led her to drink in the first place but
now the cause of her depression is her lack of control when it comes to booze.
I'm here to help her and just wanted to say thank you so much for putting the facts
here on the web. I have no doubt she'll beat the booze this time round but it's made
it more likely as she's read more and more of the letters etc on your site.

<p>
Thank you again, not only because you've steered Tracey away from a big mistake but
also for the education you've supplied to me as her partner.

<p>
my best wishes

<p>
Kicked out of the program???

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, she was going to an &quot;out-patient treatment program&quot; for alcoholism at PAAC,
the Portland Alternative Addiction Center, in downtown Portland Oregon.
A big part of their &quot;treatment program&quot; was sending people to A.A. and N.A. meetings.
A funny characteristic of the program was that they demanded that people quit drinking
at the start of the program, and stay sober all through the program.
<p>
She relapsed too many times, so they kicked her out of her housing and the program.
<p>
That reveals the twisted logic of the program. She was expected to keep herself 100% sober, even
before she had gotten the treatment. How is that supposed to work?
<p>
And A.A. teaches that you are powerless over alcohol. So what is the logic of demanding that
the patients keep themselves sober, and then sending them to meetings where they are taught
that they are powerless over alcohol, and their lives are unmanageable?
<p>
If the patients really are able to quit and stay quit before getting the course of treatment,
then how is treatment needed, and what is it supposedly doing that the patient hasn't
already done for himself or herself?

<p>
Inquiring minds want to know.

I smiled over that one.   It seems you have a deep running resentment with
the 12 Step Programs, as you've made it your mission to find fault with
them.  Good for you!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Robert,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Well, you are the umpteen-dozenth Stepper to jabber about &quot;resentments&quot;. That is like a big
red flag. The flag says,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Look at me! I'm thoroughly indoctrinated! I think in terms of slogans
and lines out of the <i>Big Book</i>!&quot;</font>
<p>
Here is
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment99" target="newwin02">the list of
previous accusations of resentments</a>.

</font>
<p>
Why are YOU anonymous?   Protecting your anonymity?   Worried the &quot;CULT&quot;
will kidnap and convert you?  hahaha!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, so now anonymity is a bad thing, is it? Not a holy virtue of Alcoholics Anonymous?
After all of Bill Wilson's sermons about the glory of anonymity?
<p>
Are you demanding that I practice anonymity like how Bill Wilson did? 
Getting his name and picture printed and broadcast until he was
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">the most famous
&quot;anonymous&quot; person in the USA</a>...

<p>
Well, in response the complaints of many Steppers like you for many years, who complained that I was
practicing anonymity just like how the Eleventh Tradition demands, I broke my anonymity a long
time ago. My birth name is Terrance Hodgins, and I live in Forest Grove, Oregon.
</font>
<p>
<a name="watered"> </a>
I read through you site.   Much of what you have is accurate, sadly,
accurate.  There never where nor ever will be a vast amount of &quot;old
timers&quot;.    Thanks to the original program getting watered down by all the
&quot;cash and carry&quot; recovery centers and such.   By the Way, Hazelton is no
part of A.A.   They too are a Cash and Carry business.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the agreement that I research carefully. But I disagree about the &quot;watered down&quot;
argument. There was never a Golden Age when A.A. worked great. Bill Wilson was just lying
and falsifying the numbers when he made
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">those grandiose claims
of success in the <i>Big Book</i></a>.
<p>
The story that A.A. was great in the Olden Days is just like any other fairy tale.
The fairy tales always jabber about how the magic of today's wizards is only a small part of what was
known to The Ancients, and how the knights of old were so much braver and nobler than
today's knights, and the kings of olden times were much more heroic and wiser than today's kings...
But that is just fairy tales.
<p>
The story that A.A. worked great in the olden days, before somebody &quot;watered it down&quot;, is
just another fairy tale.
<p>
And I know that Hazelden charges a lot of money for their quack medicine.
But Hazelden is also the single largest promoter of Alcoholics Anonymous and
12-Step superstition in the world.

</font>
<p>
As for Judges ruling that AA is a religion, poppy cock.   IN the 1930's,
unless you missed your history, Courts, Very high courts would rule and
order mentally challanged women to be sterilized so as not to procreate more
mentally ill.    They actually believed and enforced such, can you
image?!?    The eugenics program was SO effective that Nazi Germany's leader
sent represntatives over to study it.    You know where that took that one,
right?
<p>
So, it's really not too impressive that a legal mind decides that AA is a
religion.   That is there business, not AA's.     Having to lean on that is
very comical, and be careful, as with most rulings in courts, they change
from generation to generation.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And that is an example of the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#straw_man" target="_blank">Straw Man</a> propaganda technique.
<p>
Yes, A.A. is a religion. It not only demands that you believe in God, they declare what
kind of a God it is, and how this peculiar dictatorial God will perform miracles for you,
but only if you confess all of your faults and moral shortcomings and defects of character,
like in Steps 4 through 9,
and <i>Seek and Do the Will of God</i> every day, like in Step 11.
<p>
That is a religion. All of the A.A. denials are just dishonesty.
</font>
<p>
I notice that you didn't mention that AA separated from the Oxford group for
a number of reasons.   ALSO, The Oxford group WAS an offshoot of a 1st
Centry approach to Christanity.  Very religions in there basic approach.
The &quot;Drunk Squad&quot; of the Oxford group as they where called, was not actually
just for Drunks to get better, but I&quot;m sure you knew that already, yes?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I did mention
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#kicked" target="_blank">why A.A. was separated from the Oxford Group</a>:
The O.G. kicked Bill Wilson out for refusing to follow orders &#8212;
especially the order to quit recruiting alcoholics. And Bill Wilson was
committing the ultimate crime for any cult: he was building himself up as
a leader of a sub-cult, the Alcoholic Squadron, in direct competition
with the cult leader Dr. Frank Buchman. Rev. Sam Shoemaker Jr. even had
his assistant preacher deliver a sermon one Sunday morning
that denounced Bill Wilson for &quot;the divergent work of this secret group&quot;.
<p>
One of the laws of a cult is,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Thou shalt have no other cult leaders before me, for thy cult leader
is a jealous cult leader, and wants your whole life.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Unfortunately, when Bill Wilson stole the Alcoholic Squadron and made it into his own cult,
he kept all of the theology of the Oxford Groups, and still practiced the
same religion. They just dumped the Oxford Group name, and they dumped Dr. Frank Buchman,
but they kept all of Buchman's crazy beliefs and heretical theology.
And that is what A.A. still is today.
<p>
All of that other stuff that Bill Wilson said, about how he separated
his group from the Oxford Group because he had a better vision,
is just a cover-up for the fact that they kicked him out.
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#calculus_prof" target="_blank">His vain ego
couldn't stand rejection, so he had to rewrite history to make it look
like he rejected them</a>.
</font>
<p>
Thanks for the chuckle.   I love reading from those on the outside and their
opinions and views of us on the inside.        Nothing you have to say is
inaccurate, but most of it is misinterperted.   You are looking through the
eyes of disgust and distaste.   I  know them well, as I used to be just like
that.    Your web site and mission to &quot;reveal the truth&quot; about AA and such
only shows how really upset you are with AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, what I am &quot;upset with&quot; is the A.A. failure rate, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the A.A. death rate</a>, while they
tell lies about how great they are and how well it works.
</font>
<p>
No one forces anyone to come to meeting or to stay or to leave.   Hell, got
a court card?   Go to the bar and have  beer, you could get anyone there to
initial it and who's to know, I mean really?   How IS to know?   The court
system doesn't know us by our names or initials.    They get it filled on a
card and think, GREAT!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Of course
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">somebody forces people to go to A.A.</a>. Get real.

The court card system is junk.    Always was a joke, always will be.

Hi,

<p>
Been a fan of your illuminating site for years. I think you are one of
the reasons that convinced me to write &quot;Cognitive Recovery&quot;, a secular
program. It contains some AA type concepts but focuses mostly on CBT,
AVRT type techniques, living mindfully, and acceptance. Acceptance of
yourself, of whatever comes to you in life, and so on.  I didn't link to
your site because most AA people throw up their hands in horror at what
you display and I think CR can help be a weaning method of people
working recovery their own way. Lifering, Women for Sobriety, SOS, SMART
are all excellent as well. I'm not a fan of RR but that is just because
of the way Trimpey comes off. :)

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162637/http://cognitiverecovery.net/" target="_blank">
http://cognitiverecovery.net</a>

<p>
I'd appreciate your comments on the site if you have time to review it.
Also, I'd be happy to send you a copy of the book. It is basically my
method for staying sober but is a composite of many techniques out
there. I'm no genius or prophet, have seen no blinding white light, I
just put together stuff that works for my kind of addict/drunk. :)

<p>
I'm about to rewrite (yet again) the book and expand it and still don't
want to go &quot;anti-aa&quot; but you give me a lot of ideas what else to focus on.

<p>
The best thing (only good thing?) about AA is the social aspect. A
support group can be enormously helpful and like it or not, there are a
shit load of AA groups out there. They might help sustain someone until
that person can find a true method of recovery.

<p>
So, thanks!

<p>
Steve

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the tip, and thanks for the thanks.
I will review your site as soon as I can, and I'd love to see your book.
As you already know, I think, &quot;Whatever will help. Let's have dozens of choices.&quot;
And Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is definitely a good part for the mix.

<p>
So have a good day now.

world, and the little thing has already learned how to beg, and ask humans to hand over more munchies.
And some people think that these birds are stupid.

Hello Mr. Orange, hope you are doing well.

<p>
I've been using beer on and off most of life and never saw any reason to quit
or think that I was mentally dysfunctional enough to not think on my own and
be a functionable part of society. I'm 57 yrs. old or youbeer on me as young
depending on how I feel when I wake in the morning. I have never had any law
trouble till the last several years.

<p>
I've had a couple of DUI's and numerous POV's (protection order violations)
because of drinking beer and possessing beer only. Like about 8 of them (POV).
Each one landed me in jail with no way to bond out thus making a miserable
situation even worse as I lost a lotta work and jobs over this. It is
unfortunate in the way that our Judicial system treats any and/or all of us
these days in regards to Trust, Integrety and overall Judgement as humans. The
way I feel about their lack of compassion and regards for our true well being
borders on contempt.

<p>
The protection orders all stemmed from my DUI's, every time I landed in jail and
got out after lockdown from anywhere between 2wks to 2 months on the grounds of
time served they would reimpose a new protection order against alcohol for a
another year. This went on for about three years. Damn!!! Every where I went I
had eyes behind my back. Seems like they were kinda enjoying tracking me around
and searching me on demand. I was riding my bike to the beer store one day and I
heard voices behind me &quot;PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR&quot;. I thought to myself without
looking back &quot;What the hell is this a jokester&quot; Well I gave them a one finger
salute. That did not go too good as next thing was drawn guns and tasers and the
ol' reading of the riot act. They smelled the usual beer on me and I got locked
up again.

<p>
The last time I got locked up was when me and my wife were drinking as usual and
fighting as usual and she had the cops escort me out of the house. At this time
no arrests for POV's. Well my wife and the cops left the neighberhood and I
snuck back in to get some clothes and belongings(my beer) as it was extremely
cold out. 5minutes later cops and wife came thru the door and I was told a final
time to leave and not return regardless of clothes or no clothes. The cops asked
if I had a place to go and I told them of one of my sisters. I was really drunk
and they knew it. They told me to stay on sidewalks or I would get arrested. How
comforting, to this day I wish they would had aressted me instead of letting me
walk to my sisters. So I managed to get to my sisters house 3miles away and went
in and sat and waited for her to get back from work. That didn't fly to good, I
passed out in the back room and awoke to cops as usual. I got arrested for
criminal tresspassing and numerous other charges. I did not hurt anyone, have
any bad words with anyone, break anything, or break and enter, I simply walked
in and tried to wait for her. If I was not freezing to death I would have waited
outside. Oh well life goes on, I Think!!!.

<p>
So sitting in jail trying to get a Public Pretender OOOPS! I mean public
defender I finally was given my alternatives in the sacrid courtroom  6yrs
DOC (Dept. of Corrections) &quot;OR&quot;,  1yr of drug court and classes, 2 classes wk., 1
court review a month, combined with 2yrs of AA meetings twice aweek plus weekly
testing for drugs and alcohol for 2 yrs plus 2yrs supervised probation and
reporting weekly to the PO. Anything to get out of jail sounded goood at that
point so I took their incredibly shitty offer.

<p>
The last time in jail gave me time and think that I decided enough is enough I
am never drinking again considering all the misery it has brought me. It used to
be fun but through the years all of the fun turned into agony. I have quit on
many occasions thru my life for years at a time. I made up my mind it's time to
do this again QUIT.

<p>
So here I am stuck with what seems like an eternity of AA meetings. At first it
kinda seemed allright but I knew that something about the whole thing was
grating me really badly. I even attended 4 to 5 meetings a week out of boredom
and a sense inside of me that wanted to figure the AA thing out. After being
there for 7mths I got a good idea about their expectations and fallacies. At
first for awhile I figured I could just ride this thing out and it 'd be over
before I knew it. Was I ever wrong !! Get a sponsor, do the steps, read the
book, turn the only residue of a human being left in me (MY WILL!!!!!) over to
GOD and then be audacious enough to ask GOD to cure ME. What is wrong with these
people. Every thing and word that comes out of their mouthes ends in praise for
this so called wonderful program, how it saved them how they have a new life by
adhering to all the bigbook bullshit. I am so sick of hearing the preamble the
daily reflections and all the goodly praise blathered by these people. This is
absolute pure torture in the tenth degree for me but I am court ordered to do
this.

<p>
Oh, I have an alternative , I can attend Celebrate Recovery instead if I find it
more suitable to my needs. WRONG. They are a Christain-based 12-step program
also. Gee what a choice I have in this screwed up 2 horse town. There aint no
other alternative here. Nothing else is acceptable to our prideful courts
system. Whatever happened to the seperation of church and state? I am profoundly
against forced indoctrination of any kind against any person. What are we
turning into in this country a bunch of NAZIS. There is no choice in the matter
of what I believe in, it's either AA or prison. God help us all cause I don't
think any one else will. As you can see I believe in God but not what they are
proposing in the meetings. I cannot accept praying with them bacause I do not
know Whom they are praying to.

<p>
At present I also attend 2 drug court classes a wk and I don't even do drugs. But I
gotta do it or off to prison. One thing about these classes is they are not based on
spirituality or any kind of twelve step bull. They are based on self cognitive
thinking therapy. I can not find any fault or discredits in the approach, readings or
therapy. I actualy am benefiting from it. One thing that angers me is that the AA
teachings and the Drug Classes teachings totally oppose each other in their concepts
of recovery. In AA  &quot;You Do Not Recover!!!&quot;, In drug classes recovery is a goal that
can be obtained thru relearning or learning acceptable thinking processes. Damn,
talk about night and day cold and hot, good and evil. Damn, what is with these
judges and courts doing this sort of sentencing.

<p>
Well thats enough complaining for now, I admire your writings and intuitive
aparoach to to the problems of addictions. I truly believe that we all must use
our own will and choices when it comes to our recovery. Not have to be spoon fed
a bunch of heretical propaganda that has no resolve but its own.

<p>
THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH,   It sure feels good to breath some fresh air and know I am
not alone in my thoughts.

<p>
Sincerely Brian

Hello Brian,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story, and thanks for the thanks.
I'm sorry to hear that you are going through so much suffering.
I hope things are getting better now.
<p>
You clearly expose the hypocrisy of claiming that America has Freedom of Religion,
while people get sentenced to attending the services of a very strange cult
religion that still basically sells a Nazi philosophy:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;You must devote your life to serving <i>Der F&uuml;hrer im Himmel</i>.
The highest virtue, and the highest patriotism, is unquestioning obedience to the leader.
The average man is unfit to run his own life, and must follow the orders
of someone better than him.
You must have Faith in the leader, and do as you are told.&quot;
</font>
<p>
(You know how well that worked out for the Germans...)

<p>
<a name="sue_the_judge"> </a>
Oh, by the way, keep in mind the fact that you can now sue the judge for sentencing
you to a religion. And you can also sue whatever other bureaucrats and officials
were part of the coercion. That is a new wrinkle in the law, courtesy of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is simply blatantly wrong
and illegal and unConstitutional to force somebody to go to a religious service
against their will.
Look
<a href="orange-letters159.html#sue_judge" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters148.html#Inouye" target="newwin2001">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters162.html#Inouye" target="newwin2002">here</a>.
<p>
I would save that for after you get done with your legal difficulties, and they
cannot retaliate.
If a few people do sue that pants off of some judges, the religious coercion will
stop real fast.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hey, maybe you want to take that James Frey quote off your site since he's a
compulsive liar.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello RHP,
<p>
Actually, calling James Frey a &quot;compulsive liar&quot; is a bit much. The way that I hear it,
he originally presented his story as a work of fiction &#8212; a realistic novel
that was largely, but not entirely, autobiographical.
But his publisher said that the public wants sensational true stories, fiction doesn't
sell that well, so rewrite it as &quot;a true story&quot;, and jazz it up a bit.
<p>
Now you can criticize James Frey for being less
than 100% honest about the reality of the story. Personally, I wouldn't have gone along
with the publisher's instructions.

<p>
About the quote, I've thought of deleting it. But it is a true quote:

It makes sense that you would make excuses for James Frey.

<p>
I doubt Frey was, or is, an alcoholic.  He had heavy drinker written all
over him.  So, yeah, he needs one step.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, RHP,
<p>
No, I'm not making excuses for James Frey. I just said that calling him a &quot;compulsive liar&quot; is inaccurate.
Words mean things, and James Frey does not fit the definition of a &quot;compulsive liar&quot;.
<p>
Dishonest author? Yes. &quot;Compulsive liar&quot;? No.
<p>
The &quot;alcoholic&quot; versus &quot;heavy drinker&quot; is just another word game, just a false dichotomy.
Fashionably rich alcoholics prefer to call themselves &quot;heavy drinkers&quot;.
It sounds so much more fashionable and macho.
<p>
Have a good day.
