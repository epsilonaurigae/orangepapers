Undoubtedly you and whatever staff you have are highly overworked.   Some
of that I'm sure is due to budget constraint read about two hours of your
on-line sites.  I cannot determine who you are or what occurred in the  past
to promote your feelings, but you do what you must.  Unfortunately the  blog
responses have been deleted.  You are probably aware of that.   Hope to read
more.  Much is disturbing never hearing that AA was a  cult.  How many
groups out of hundreds of thousands are like that?   Clean house brother.

Hello Bruce,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, I'm overworked. (There is no &quot;staff&quot;, just me.)
<p>
For who I am, and what prompted my feelings,
<a href="orange-letters136.html#who_r_u" target="newwin88">see the list here</a>.

<p>
I don't know what blog you are referring to, where my responses were deleted.
My responses get deleted a lot, and so do the responses of other people who
dare to criticize the 12-Step orthodoxy.
Steppers are not very good at tolerating criticism, and they definitely don't
want to hear the truth.
So they erase things that they don't want you to know.
Steppers vulch on Wikipedia, for instance, and anything that they don't like
is editted out in an hour or so.

<p>
Yes, it is disturbing to hear that A.A. is a cult. I was very surprised myself.
I started off thinking that A.A. was the biggest and best self-help group in
the USA. It came as a bit of a shock to discover that &quot;it ain't necessarily so&quot;.
It was rather disgusting to see that sick people were getting quackery and
superstition from criminals and mentally-ill people, rather than anything resembling good
medical treatment.

<p>
Which groups are like that? Well, apparently, a lot. I don't have the entire list,
but you can start with
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin25">Mike Quinones' Midtown Group</a>
 and
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="newwin26">Clancy Imusland's Pacific Group</a>.

<p>
And then there are stories about the
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="newwin28">Phoenix Young People's A.A.</a>,
and groups in
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322003623/http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=185546838&amp;blogID=265904083" target="newwin29">Minneapolis</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters100.html#Bainbridge" target="newwin89">Bainbridge Island, Washington</a>.
<p>
So click on those links to read more about them.

Have a good day now.

It helps to be a speed reader.  Thanks for the updates.  You my  friend
have found a quite unique means of securing &quot;Recovery&quot;.  Whatever  works I
always say.  I'm probably not the first &quot;sex addict&quot; who has read  any orange,
but it makes a few of us comfortable in knowing that  whatever you do TAKES
TIME.  Doing anything that lesson the power of the  drug that desires to
control us is great.  Keep it up.  Keep looking  for other programs.   There
are dozens of them.  Not all are  12-step.  Some definitely are religious (not
cult), but they don't judge  nor hide that fact.  We are weal when we try
to control our addict on our  own...without some knowledge or help or prayer
or surrender.  Would you  agree?

<p>
I'm in Chicago.  Perhaps some day we meet in person.  I applaud  your work
because it keeps you sober.  You could not write what you have  otherwise.

Hi Bruce,
<p>
Thanks for the response. I wish you luck on your journey.
<p>
You know, doing this web site isn't really what keeps me sober.
What does it is things like going outside, and feeling the air and sun on my skin,
and inhaling, and my lungs don't hurt. Then I can feel my body move, and it's a healthy
body, with the muscles and tendons moving smoothly (even if the joints are getting a little
old and sore now).
<p>
And then, because I am so healthy, I have to move. I can't just sit around, doing nothing.
So I go outside, and walk down to the river, and see the geese, and feed the cute baby goslings,
who joyously come running when they see me, because they know that I bring them goodies.
And I watch the river flow by, and see the clouds floating across the sky, and take in
the whole cityscape... And feel the sun, hot on my skin.
<p>
I wouldn't trade that for all of the beer in Portland.
<p>
And then there is waking up without a hangover. Waking up without that little voice asking,
&quot;How much longer do you think you can keep on doing this,
and being this sick, before you die?&quot;
<p>
(And the answer being, &quot;Oh, about 3 years.&quot;)
<p>
I just have zero desire to go back to that kind of suffering.
<p>
And then there is just the clarity. My mind is clearer than it has been in a lot of years,
and I don't want to give that up and go back to being cloudy-headed, or foggy.
Just one night of drinking would take the edge off of the clarity for a long time.
It has taken 9 years to get this clear, and I think I'll keep it.
<p>
Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I am free at last.
<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

<p>

you've spent so much time on this slaying of AA. I'm fascinated to
hear your solution.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Alex,
<p>
We have talked many times about what works, and what has helped people to quit
drinking or drugging.
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works" target="newwin36">Here is a list</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin37">here is another</a>.

<p>
But please note that there is no magic &quot;solution&quot;.
The idea that there is a &quot;solution&quot;
(Bill Wilson's word) is a myth that A.A. has been spreading for 70 years now:
&quot;Just do these 'spiritual' Steps, and 'Work A Stong Program',
 and Hey Presto-Chango! Abra-Cadabra! You will quit drinking.&quot;
<p>
But the truth is that you really have to quit drinking yourself. Nobody can or will
do it for you.
<p>
But, of course, then they say, &quot;You have to do all of the work yourself. The Program won't
do it for you. The reason that the Steps didn't work is because you didn't <i>thoroughly</i>
follow our Path.&quot;

<p>
So A.A. doesn't really offer a solution either. The idea that A.A. has &quot;a Program&quot;
that &quot;works&quot; is just a bait-and-switch trick:

<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#make_you_quit" target="newwin40">First it works, and then it doesn't.
First, the story is that the Twelve Steps will work and make you quit drinking, and then they won't.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#a_cure" target="newwin39">First, a cure, and then, no cure.
First, hope of recovery, and then hopelessness.</a>

</ul>

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	the orange papers<br>

<p>
Based on your writings on your website, you will do your best to shoot this email to
pieces and be on with your day.  You don't know what you're talking about.  The
problem with AA isn't that the 12 Steps don't work, it's that people don't do any of
them.  I agree completely that people come in and out and relapse all the time.
These are the people who didn't do any of the work involved.  I have sponsored
several people and lead them through the work of the 12 Steps and had a %100 success
rate.  Every single person that went through all 12 Steps and did them thoroughly
are still clean and sober today.  Every single one.  The only people that relapsed
are the ones who came in, asked me to sponsor them, I tell them what to do, then
they don't do any of it.  You're a narrow minded fool, I don't like you personally.
Your examples are (what I could force myself to read) are over-simplified and just
plain stupid.  Just because the court system
pumps somebody through AA who doesn't even want to be there and they don't
magically get sober after one meeting, doesn't give you the right to spew idiocy on
your crappy website.

<p>
Get bent, your writing sucks.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Ryan W, hard core heroin addict clean for 6 years thanks to God and the Steps.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ryan,
<p>
Congratulations on your 6 years off of heroin. That is good. I hope you stay with it.

<p>
Now, about your claim that
<font color="black">
&quot;The problem with AA isn't that the 12 Steps don't work, it's that people don't do any of them.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Wow. There seems to be a strong echo in here. The same subject came up in the previous
letter,
<a href="orange-letters164.html#solution" target="newwin41">here</a>.

<p>
The problem is, even if you do the Steps, you still don't get cured. It's a bait-and-switch
trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#a_cure" target="newwin39">First a cure, and then no cure</a>.

 <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#make_you_quit" target="newwin40">First, the story is that the Twelve Steps will work and make you quit drinking or drugging, and then you have to
quit drinking and drugging to &quot;Work The Steps&quot; properly</a>.

<p>
Your insistence that people must &quot;Work the Steps&quot; properly, or else, makes it another
bait-and-switch trick, too:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="newwin43">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

<p>
And what about all of the people who faithfully work the steps and then get so depressed that
they commit suicide? Like
<a href="orange-letters100.html#Bainbridge" target="newwin89">this story</a>.

<p>
It is good that you have several sponsees that have quit heroin. But such anecdotal
evidence does not in any way prove or even indicate that doing the 12 Steps to
Frank Buchman's religion actually cause people to quit addictions.
Your story just proves that you were able to collect half a dozen people who
really wanted to quit heroin &#8212; people who were willing to do just about
 any silly thing to succeed in quitting
&#8212; people who were willing to <i>&quot;go to any length&quot;</i> to succeed.
Those are the people who are highly motivated to quit and stay quit, so
of course they did the best.

<p>
What about the judge telling them that he would put them back in prison if they
didn't stay clean? Don't you think that had something to do with it?
<p>
What about marriages saved, or children reclaimed?
<p>
What about the expense of a drug habit, and the shame, and nightmarish junkie
environment?
<p>
What about the desire to not die that way?
<p>
That's the problem with such claims that the 12 Steps work.  You are ignoring all
of the other facts, and just trying to give the credit for successes to the 12 Steps.
<p>
You are also ignoring the obvious fact that when the other people decided to go back to
heroin, they didn't do the steps any more. And you then complained that they
weren't doing the Step work right.
Then you convinced yourself that they went back to heroin because they didn't work the Steps,
which is reversing the cause-and-effect chain.
<p>
Oh, and there is one other big hole in your logic: You never counted those junkies who successfully
kicked the habit without any 12-Step nonsense.
There are lots of them &#8212; more than the number of junkies who quit with the 12-Step program.
But you are ignoring them.  They prove that the 12-Step hocus-pocus routine is unnecessary.
<p>
Now, you accused me of simple-mindedness. I have just one simple question for you:
Can you explain how doing
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="newwin42">the strange practices of Frank Buchman's pro-Nazi cult</a>
will cause junkies to quit shooting heroin?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Even when I was seven and had just heard about AA, I always felt there was
something... off about it. Something that made me uncomfortable and edgy, even
though I've never known someone who has gone (or spoken about it). I always chalked
it up to being unable to accept that there was nothing religious about a &quot;Higher
Power&quot;*, but now I'm fairly sure that it was an innate intuition about what is safe
and what is not.

<p>
Thank you for the website, it's very enlightening. Albeit long. I'm going to have to
spend the next few days/weeks reading through it all.

<p>
*I've never understood the atheist cop-out of &quot;use the person you want to be as a
Higher Power&quot;. I can't comprehend it. Why would I bother to envision the person I
want to be telling me what to do, when I can try immediately to be me now? And what
happens if my standards change? Some days I fancy an enigmatic mystique, and some
days I feel like a raging warrior... I can't give myself a box and still be free.
Change is central to who and what I am.

<p>
Also, I'm pantheist pagan. What &quot;higher power&quot; do I have? The gods I believe in are
individuals with a special connection to and power with/through some force of
nature. I've always thought that if you're trying to subjugate yourself and your
mind and your will to anything, you immediately have a huge unhealthy problem on
your hands.

Hello Em Dot,

Do you realise how many thousands (if not millions) of lives have been saved by AA?
Do you realise how many people you may have killed by putting them off seeling the
help they may have needed thro AA by your irresponsible paper? Did youever read
'Emotional sobriety' written by Bill in which he admits after 21 years he is only
just beginning to realise the humility required for good living. Are you a saint
yourself?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kate,
<p>
Here we go again. A.A. has not saved millions of lives. In fact, the number is so close to zero
that A.A. actually kills more people than it saves.
I have answered that grandiose false claim so many times that I'll just point you at some of
the previous answers:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters3.html#saved_millions" target="newwin71">AA has saved millions
 of lives so what do you or anyone else care if its bull crap?</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters55.html#saved_millions" target="newwin72">AA has saved millions of lives all over the world.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters60.html#saved_millions" target="newwin73">I can see that
you haven't worked the steps or you wouldn't be wasting your time cutting
down a program that has saved millions of lives.</a>
</ol>

<p>
Then, your next line was:
<font color="black">
&quot;Do you realise how many people you may have killed by putting them off seeling the
help they may have needed thro AA by your irresponsible paper?&quot;
</font>
<p>
Wow. You are repeating all of the standard A.A. lines, aren't you? Not an original thought in
there anywhere.
<p>
Again, since A.A. kills more people than it saves, warning people about A.A. is not killing them.
<p>
And again, I've answered that line so many times that I will point you at the list,

'Please realize that your &quot;need&quot; to defame AA may literally kill.'</a>

Bill's &quot;Emotional Sobriety&quot;? You've got to be joking. Bill Wilson
was a screaming raving lunatic, who tried to minimize and deny his insane behavior 
by saying that he was going on &quot;emotional benders&quot;.

<p>
Bill Wilson wrote that Al-Anon Family Group members spoke at the
Alcoholics Anonymous 20th Anniversary convention,
parroting Bill's teachings like this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Family Group speakers asked and answered plenty of questions like these:
&quot;Weren't we just as powerless over alcohol as the alcoholics themselves?
Sure we were.&quot;
&quot;And when we found that out, weren't we often filled with just as much bitterness
and self-pity as the alcoholic ever had been? Yes, that was sometimes a fact.&quot;
&quot;After the first tremendous relief and happiness which resulted when A.A. came
along, hadn't we often slipped back into secret and deep hurt that A.A. had
done the job and we hadn't? For many of us, it was certainly so.&quot;
&quot;Not realizing that alcoholism is an illness, hadn't we taken sides with
the kids against the drinking member? Yes, we had often done that, to their
damage. No wonder then, that when sobriety came, the emotional benders in our
homes often went right on and sometimes got worse.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 33.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Humility had nothing to do with it. It wasn't a matter of humility; it was a matter of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="newwin76">a narcissistic
personality disorder with delusions of grandeur</a>.
The self-pitying Bill Wilson claimed that he was &quot;damaged&quot; by
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#drunken_sot" target="newwin83">his wife Lois calling him a drunken sot</a>.

So Bill continued to throw screaming temper tantrums to get his own way.

<p>
No, I'm not a saint, but I'm much better than Bill.

Have a good day.

&quot;My name is Jaime Banks and I was the victim of coerced 12-Step &quot;treatment&quot; at a
Salvation Army &quot;rehabilitation&quot; program in Sarasota, Florida. The following poem is
a testament to the emotions I experienced following the realization that I was being
forced into a cult. It is also indicative of my general woe over mental health and
substance hyper-use issues, and how both are addressed in contemporary America. In
addition to forced &quot;treatment&quot;, I also spent a short amount of time in jail, and a
lot of time on probation, due to my use of cannabis. All of these factors have made
indelible impact upon my psyche.

<p>
I have seen throughout the Internet your bashing of AA with facts you deem
as being important by obscure individuals who as they say ( birds of a
feather flock together ) . I have been sober in the Fellowship Of Alcoholics
Anonymous for 26 years now. I work a simple program of recovery based on the
Book Alcoholics Anonymous. I have sponsored men who come into AA and when
they they follow the instructions outlined in the book Alcoholics Anonymous,
they stay sober and live productive lives NO LONGER living in a life of
DIS-EASE from the effects of addictions. The 75% expressed in the Big Book
convey to me that when I follow the instructions I am happier, more joyous
and freer than I was was when I was in the bondage's of my addictions The
percentages you spout are nothing more than generalizations of information
that can be twisted in any pretzel shape you wish. I believe what you
attempting ( and attempting is giving you way to much credit ) is to put
down thru your own prejudices ( for whatever reason ...your issues ) some
thing that has saved millions of lives and really asked for nothing in
return except to do what we do ANONYMOUSLY, you are trying to compare apples
and oranges ( no pun intended ) A spiritual program of recovery with a bunch
of numbers and biased opinions. All you have to do is look and listen in AA
who has saved people lives and the change in the Fellowship because most
people are like sheep, if they don't want to do something and they hear
something that fits into their agenda of AVOIDING what is going in their
lives ,they will buy it. My experience is that if I come into AA do the
simple things suggested in the Book, I will have a change in attitudes and
actions which will allow me to recovery from MY seemingly hopeless state of
mind and body I came here with 26 years ago

Hello Rick,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
It's funny that you believe &quot;the 75% expressed in the <i>Big Book</i>&quot;,
and then complain that &quot;The
percentages you spout are nothing more than generalizations of information&quot;.
You have it exactly backwards. But that is a common cult characteristic &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_denial" target="newwin69">Denial of the truth. Reversal of reality.</a>

<p>
Bill Wilson was flat-out lying when he made up that &quot;75% recovered&quot; number.
Specifically, he was lying with qualifiers. Remember the words that came before
the 75% number?
What Bill Wilson really wrote in 1955, in the Foreword to the Second Edition
of the <i>Big Book</i>, page XX, was:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="newwin68">Of alcoholics who
came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.
Other thousands came to a few A.A. meetings and at first decided
they didn't want the program. But great numbers of these &#8212; about
two out of three &#8212; began to return as time passed.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The truth is that very few alcoholics qualified &#8212; in Bill's mind &#8212; as &quot;came to A.A. and really tried&quot;.
A.A. had a terrible failure rate, and Bill hid the truth by
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="newwin68">lying with qualifiers</a>.
Everybody from Bill's secretary Nell Wing to Lois Wilson's secretary Francis Hartigan
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin80">reported that A.A.
really had a success rate that was only five percent</a>, but Bill Wilson
wrote &quot;75%&quot; in the <i>Big Book</i>. He was lying to make his cult sound better.

<p>
That whole paragraph is just loaded with weasle words. &quot;Began to return&quot; is another weasle.
&quot;Began to return&quot;? Either they really did return, or they didn't. Well, they didn't.
<p>
And how could Bill Wilson have possibly kept track of &quot;thousands&quot; of nameless &quot;anonymous&quot;
people who only came to one or two
A.A. meetings, and didn't like what they saw, and left, only to &quot;begin to return&quot; years later?
The answer is, Bill didn't have a computer, and Bill did not keep track of them, so Bill could
not compute that &quot;about two out of three &#8212; began to return as time passed.&quot;
Bill was just lying again.

<p>
I have discussed the fraud in that quote before,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="newwin76">here</a>.
<p>
And A.A. has not saved millions, either. The previous letter made the same false claim,
so I'll refer you to that discussion,
<a href="orange-letters164.html#millions_saved" target="newwin77">here</a>.

<p>
The reason that I express the opinions that I do is because of the facts. The truth is
that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="newwin78">A.A. is a failure as a cure for alcoholism</a>.
It is merely
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="newwin79">a successful cult</a> that fools millions,
just the same as Scientology.
<p>
It is not spiritual to lie to sick people about how well a suggested cure really works.
Such behavior is despicable. Alcoholics Anonymous is not a spiritual organization.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Thank you for reply. I am not going to argue about something that I have
seen work time after time. I was a product of medical model therapy and I
could not stay clean &amp; sober. As a member of the so-called cult you speak of
,I have been able to put together a life I could not have dreamed of. As for
the 75% I have seen it in my AA lifetime, that is a very accurate figure.
BTW as someone who has been a part of something and found it wanting as in
your personal case I would question who in fact has a closed mind to all
principles. As you well know ,&quot; there is a principle which is a bar against
all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail
keep a man in everlasting ignorance &#8212; that principle is contempt prior to
investigation

<p>
Namast&eacute;. May you walk your journey in peace and harmony.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rick,
<p>
It is good that you quit drinking alcohol. That really improves your life, doesn't it?
<p>
You are still just assuming a cause-and-affect relationship where none exists.
<p>
So you thought about quitting drinking twice. You gave it a half-hearted attempt the
first time, and that didn't work. So you got serious about it and really did it on the
second attempt. So what? That is the story of millions of people. Most people do it that way.
<p>
That has nothing to do with whether you were trying &quot;a medical model&quot; or a cult religion model.
<p>
Assuming that the medical model did not work, but A.A. did, is two logical errors:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc" target="newwin39">
&quot;It happened after X, so it was caused by X.&quot; == <i>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="newwin38">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>
</ol>
<p>
The proper way to figure out whether a treatment for a disease
really works is clinical tests, like
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>.
Anecdotal evidence is completely unreliable, and totally worthless.
<p>
And that 75% success rate was just one of Bill Wilson's brazen lies. He was
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers"><i>Lying with Qualifiers</i></a>,
trying to fool people into thinking that A.A. really worked.
We just talked about that. You claim that you see a 75% success rate,
but you don't say what qualifiers you are using to get that success rate,
like &quot;who really tried&quot;, or &quot;who thoroughly followed our path&quot;.
What is the success rate when you take all of the qualifiers off of
the sentence?
What success rate do you get with <i>ALL</i> of the alcoholic newcomers in general?
<p>
How about this question:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">here</a>.)

<p>
Parrotting
<a href="orange-letters165.html#Spencer">
the &quot;contempt before investigation&quot; misquote</a>
in defense of ineffective cult religion quackery is really disingenuous.
<p>
By the way, I have thoroughly examined and investigated Alcoholics 
Anonymous and it's &quot;cure&quot;, or &quot;non-cure, but one-day reprieve&quot;, and found it wanting.
I have <i>contempt after investigation</i>.

you for your site.  I first attended an AA meeting in 1981.  Fortunately for
me, someone belched over purposefully and at great length during the Lord's
prayer.  It took me about 7 more years of AA meetings before I found a group
in Los Angeles, We Agnostics.  There I met Ernie, who burned the Big Book in
disgust after a first reading. And Steve who went through and re-wrote his
(a trick I hear Thomas Jefferson did with his bible).  We Agnostics was (and
still is) an AA group, but I think you need a big city to get that lucky.

<p>
Two of the members went to Portland.  One quit going to AA, the other
started a meeting called Rebellion Dogs.  Over these past 29 years, I've
come to know lots of people who stopped drinking on their own, and who have
remained sober after they stopped going to AA meetings.  I've got 22 years,
and AA did not do shit for me until I found a group of people who 1) did not
believe in god (or were at least ambivalent) and 2) did not lie about how
fucking wonderful sobriety was.

<p>
Your site is hysterical except where the awfulness of AA is too much.
<p>
Thanks again.

Hi Sherril,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
And congratulations on all of your years of sobriety. Why you would be one of
the High Holy Old-Timers, if you weren't such a heretic... :-)
<p>
I'm in Portland, and never heard of the Rebellion Dogs group. I'll have
to keep my ears open, and maybe I'll run into them some time.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Interpretation of 5M/12-90/TC<br>

<p>
Dear Mr Orange

<p>
I came across your website, and believe I found a mistake in your
interpretation of the document labelled  &quot;5M/12-90/TC&quot; on the page
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="newwin82">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts</a>

<p>
As I read the document  the percentages given are &quot;the proportion of
those who are in their first year who are within their nth month&quot;.
That is, out of 100 people who have been in AA for less than a year,
19 have been there less than a month, 13 between 1 and 2 months etc.

<p>
Thus, the correct number for &quot;one year success rate&quot; is around 26%
(5/19), not 5%.

<p>
I will agree that this is not clear from the graph itself, but if you
read the accompanying text, the above interpretation is the only one
making sense.

<p>
I do believe you have some valid points,  and  hope you will make
corrections to your site to reflect the above.

<p>
Best regards,

Hello Nis,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I agree with your first statement, but not the second.
That is, other people and I originally interpreted that chart as a longitudinal study,
tracking how long people remained in A.A. But it was not a longitudinal study, something done over time.
It was just an easy-to-do one-day snapshot picture of the membership with less than
a year of membership.
<p>
But that snapshot still revealed a huge dropout rate. Look at the further discussion
of that chart where somone in the New York A.A. reinterpreted the chart, and then
I reinterpreted it again,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ny_aa" target="newwin79">here</a>

<p>
No way does that chart of numbers indicate that 26% of the newcomers are still around
at the one-year point. Either way you look at the numbers (correctly), they still reveal
a high dropout rate.

<p>
And then there is the corroborating evidence. All of the other people who have studied the
problem and given numbers also reported the same five percent retention rate (which also happens
to be
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="newwin88">the normal rate
of spontaneous remission in alcoholics)</a>:

<ol>
<p><li> Bill Wilson's secretary
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Nell_Wing4" target="newwin81">Nell Wing</a>

<p><li> Lois Wilson's secretary
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Hartigan1" target="newwin82">Francis Hartigan</a>

<p><li> Dr. George E. Vaillant, a former member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc., who spend about 20 years treating alcoholics with A.A., and who
also spent 8 years tracking his first 100 patients, trying to prove that A.A. works.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="newwin83">He had to conclude that A.A. was completely ineffective</a> and had an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate.
He also got a five percent success rate &#8212; and it was from normal spontaneous remission,
not from the A.A. program. And Dr. Vaillant said so.

<p><li> Then there is the Chairman of A.A. in Australia. He also reported that they had only
a five percent retention rate.
</ol>
<p>
And last but not least, you have your own eyes. If you have been going to A.A. meetings for
very long, you know about the revolving-door problem. 
They come in, they go out, they come in, they go out. If you like the looks of some newcomers,
you had better get to know them fast, because they probably won't be around for very long.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Dear Mr Orange

<p>
While you agree that your original interpretation was wrong, it is
still up there on your website as the first bit of analysis of that
report.

<p>
You refute your critics by introducing an out-of-nowhere statistic of
&quot;first days&quot; attenders, which by coincidence gives the same retention
rate as in your original analysis.

<p>
This suggests to me that you are constitutionally incapable of being
honest, and I will not try to change your mind.

<p>

Hello Nis,
<p>
I have been reluctant to erase
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="newwin241">the first
interpretation</a>,
because it has historical
relevance, and has been discussed by both sides many times.

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ny_aa" target="newwin242">The following
interpretation by the New York A.A. group is</a>
based on it too, and that response would become
confusing and irrelevant without the context of the first interpretation.
<p>
Still, I suppose I should put an explanatory note there, saying that I have
gradually come to the conclusion that the study is a one-day snapshot.
I'll add it to my list of 1000 things to do.

<p>
What you are overlooking is the fact that the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ny_aa2" target="newwin243">second way of
interpreting the chart</a>
makes the results <i><b>worse</b></i>, not better. So it wasn't necessary
for me to go all through my writings and change all of
the &quot;5% retention rate&quot; statements in my web site
as I gradually came to the conclusion that the study was a
cheap-and-easy one-day snap-shot of the
newcomers, rather than a longitudinal study.
<p>
What is worse about the one-day snap-shot interpretation is the
fact that a one-day survey done only once every three years, when the
triennial surveys are conducted, will not count the immense number of
A.A. beginners who only came to a few A.A. meetings and were appalled
by what they saw, and walked out and didn't come back.
When you include them in the count, the retention rate is way below 5%.

<p>
And then of course we have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin244">all of
the historical quotes</a>
from Bill Wilson and the founders' secretaries, declaring that they
had a disastrous retention rate then too, no better than 5%, and often
worse.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hello again, anonymous,
<p>
It's easy to be homeless. All that you need is a new property management corporation to
take over the building that you live in and decide to crack the whip and get the
tenants in line with lots of new rules and threats. And I was gone.
I was not about to pay money to live under such conditions.
 I hired a crew with a truck
and moved all of my stuff to a storage locker.
<p>
And then, out of sheer vindictiveness, the manageress declared that she had a new rule:
Tenants were no longer allowed to load trucks at the truck loading area in the garage,
which is conveniently located directly across from the elevator.
No, I had to hand-carry everything that I owned through the lobby to the street out front,
where we had to park the truck in a metered parking space, when we could find one.
That tells you what kind of people they are &#8212; torturing an elderly disabled veteran
at Christmas because she was angry that I was moving out,
rather than obeying her orders, which I suppose messed up
her averages for occupancy and keeping tenants.
It took four days to get everything packed and out that way. And one of those four days,
the manageress allowed incoming tenants to unload their truck in the truck loading
area. So much for the new rule.
That was Pinnacle Property Management who did that. They are also on the Internet.

<p>
But now I have finally found a much better place to live.
The story is
