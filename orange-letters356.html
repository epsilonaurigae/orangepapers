My apologize. I did forget to mention that 30 million book sales was over a period
of 77 years and the natural attrition rate is due to natural death<br>
And not suicide. Sometimes those looking for statistics will overlook simple truths
and would rather state that they commitetd suicide because they drank against there
will

<p>
Thank you

Hello again, Randy,
<p>
Yes, of course I knew that the A.A. book sales were over a 70-year period.
<p>
The fact remains that you do not measure the success rate of a treatment
program for a &quot;disease&quot;, as A.A. calls &quot;alcoholism&quot;, by book sales.
The numbers for book sales show that Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
in New York City, is a successful publishing house, just like Random House or
Simon &amp; Schuster.  But that has nothing to do with curing a disease.
The book sales are actually irrelevant when it comes to helping alcoholics.
But A.A. members love to brag about book sales, as if that makes A.A. big and
important and successful. (See the signature below.)
<p>
The A.A. attrition rate is not due to &quot;natural death&quot;. It is due to dropouts who
just quit A.A. The A.A. organization in Australia did a formal study of the problem
and found that 95% of the newcomers were gone in a year. They did not all die;
they just walked out. (And then some of them ceremonially burned their <i>Big Book</i>
and 12X12.
I've received several letters from people who did that. Photographs of it, even.)

<p>
About the suicides: I never heard of relatives claiming that someone committed
suicide, to avoid revealing that someone drank too much.  When people want
to gloss over death by alcohol, they usually call it death due to
complications from liver failure or renal failure.
<p>
Oh, and people who die from alcohol abuse are not &quot;drinking against their will&quot;.

Have a good day now.

From: 	&quot;Rick D.&quot;<br>
Subject: 	My story<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
I went to rehab in 1985 at the age of 24 (my decision), and was told to go to
AA upon my return home.  I went to meetings for 12 years, worked the steps,
service, etc..
<p>
  In 1997 I wanted a drink (my drug was heroin), and started
drinking. I drank because I WANTED TO.  I continued going to meetings, I
believe due to my ego and not wanting to look like a loser due to the
&quot;brainwashing&quot; that I had allowed to happen to me over the years.
<p>
I stopped going to AA in 2001 and started using heroin again, BECAUSE I WANTED
TO.  After a 4 year run, which destroyed my life, I put myself into a detox and
returned to AA.  Right from my return, I started to see things MUCH differently
about AA. The same flowery BS was being spewed by the regulars who had some time
and the constant whining and complaining by just about everyone. I knew within
myself that &quot;I&quot; had made the decision to get clean again.  I started sharing
with brutal honesty how I felt about what I was witnessing. Needless to say, it
wasn't received too well. I realized that no matter what I shared about my own
experience it couldn't help anyone else, they had to do this on their own.
<p>
I stopped going to AA in 2006 and my life is incredible.  I'm clean 8 years, have
a wonderful wife and an amazing daughter.  I have nothing to do with anyone in AA
and have rebuilt old relationships with people that I lost touch with while in
AA.
<p>
In my opinion (taken from personal experience), most of the people in AA are
broken in one way or another (as I was), and by choice or coercion remain
helpless and needy.  I knew a gentleman who was clean over 12 years and still
called his sponsor everyday to &quot;check-in&quot;.  And . . . AND, he went to school to
get his counseling degree and let his very profitable business go under, because
he &quot;knew&quot; that his experience could help others get clean.
<p>
I saw it all over the years; 13th stepping, molestation, control freaks, overblown
egos, constant relapsing, the list goes on and on and on..  I AM HAPPY, JOYOUS,
AND FREE, no thanks to the lunatics in AA.

<p>

Hello Duke,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story, and I'm glad to hear that you are healthy and happy now.

Subject: 	Re: Another Bullshit Comment from the Peanut Gallery<br>

<p>
I got back from my 21st birthday party not too long ago. I had me two cocktails and
two shots over the course of four hours. One of the shots was the free birthday cake
shot. So I'm a bit tipsy. Probably can't take my Saphris tonight, but I'll be fine.
I actually feel less drunk now than I did with drinking just one bottle of Redd's
Apple Ale earlier in the week. I hear that's normal. People overestimate how drunk
they are when they drink a little, then underestimate when they drink a lot. And
whatever an alcoholic is, I don't think I'm one. I can set a limit to how many
drinks I want in a night and stick to it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Right. That doesn't sound like an alcoholic at all. And happy birthday,
and welcome to adulthood. (Although you will find that it doesn't get you as
much as you imagined.)

</font>
<p>
My tablet's still working pretty well, other than the mouse receiver finally dying.
Poor thing was bare circuitboard. I just swiped the unifying receiver from my
wireless keyboard and paired it with the mouse. It was easy to do, though I don't
know if the software works under WINE. The receiver should still work with the
keyboard, too. Logitech stuff is great.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I shall have to get one of those unifying receivers and try it. I have a couple
of good Logitech wireless mice without receivers.
</font>
<p>
How's your tablet doing?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Fine. I finally got the updates figured out, so it is running Android 2.1 and working
well. And I got FTP, SSH, and a root terminal window all working. So it really is
like a tiny Linux computer. Next I want to repartition the internal SD card because
they made the &quot;system&quot; partition far too small. Only 150 MB out of 4 GB. I could use
much less &quot;book storage&quot; space and much more system space, because the system space
gets full fast when you install a bunch of apps. The tricky part of that is that the
card is not removeable, so I need a bootable program that will repartition and
reformat the card with three file systems (swap, ext3, and FAT32) all in one go.

</font>
<p>
And to be fair to human children, goslings do have the advantage of not having
grown-ups manufacture and market food to them that are specifically designed to be
tasty, but lacking in nutrients. I wonder what this country would look like if
advertising during children's programming stayed illegal.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Really. Goslings are not bombarded with TV commercials that teach them to
eat bad food.  I think that a lot of food company executives should be shipped off to
Leavenworth for what they have done to our children.
Like High Fructose Corn Syrup in everything.
They have literally killed a lot of people. Like with diabetes.

</font>
<p>
Drunk though I may be, I believe I can still reason better than Randaron. Last I
checked, nobody's painting Sigmund Freud like a religious figure. Nobody's making
pilgrimages to wherever Freud came from like AAers do with Akron or wherever Bill
Wilson came from (cannot be bothered to check). And there's been several decades of
advancement in the field of psychology since Freud. Can't say the same for AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, really.
</font>
<p>
Besides, what exactly are people like me supposed to do without psychiatrists? Spend
the rest of my life miserable and hallucinating while locked up like a hardened
criminal? No thanks. I don't wanna be like you, Randy.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I find it curious how some mentally-ill people just rave about how psychiatrists
are so bad, and all wrong, and evil.  Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of
Scientology, comes to mind. He was a raving lunatic &#8212; a paranoid
schizophrenic &#8212; who claimed that he had died
and returned to life twice. (He's really dead and gone now. Third time is a charm, I guess.)
And he died screaming that he was plagued by interplanetary cooties that he couldn't
get off of his body. Hubbard taught that
we are all bothered by memories of injuries that we suffered in previous lifetimes
on other planets, but if you only give him $100,000 or $200,000, he will help you
with that problem. And psychiatrists are wrong about everything, and
they are just trying to keep human minds enslaved.
<p>
Oh yeh, right. Now there's a church that will restore you to sanity. <i>(Not!)</i>

<p>
Anyhow, that's enough of that. Did you hear about that Google Wallet thing coming
out where you can attach money to an email? I think I'll finally be able to send a
few bucks.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I did hear about it, and I set up an account. And it worked in the sense of
I still have not figured out how to set up accepting donations. Their web pages
are not at all clear about that. My Google email address is orange.papers@gmail.com.
<p>
(But people, please do not email to that address. I never check it. It's just
a spam bucket. A friend emailed me there and I didn't see his letter for a month.
The reason that I don't use Gmail is because Google reads our email to figure out
what advertisements to show us next. No privacy whatsoever.)

<p>
Last year, they froze my debit card one Saturday when I bought two disk drives online
and deactivated the card.
I discovered that the card was not working when I tried to pay for a purchase
at Goodwill and it was declined.
<p>
Worse, the only way to get the card turned back on was to call a particular
phishing). But I didn't have a phone.
I emailed them and they said that I must call the number. That there was no
other way to resolve the problem. Another help line guy said
that he would try to fix it, but that didn't happen. That went on for many
months and was never really resolved. They just issued me a new card the next year.
<p>
of my identification and email them the images. (Enough documents for identify
theft.) A friend said that that was illegal.  That sudden, arbitrary demand came
purchased thousands of dollars of goods, like computers and cameras.
Suddenly they didn't believe who I was and I had to prove my identity.
<p>
good competing online payment systems so that no one company can dominate the market and
become arrogant and demanding.

Now I'm gonna loaf around with Alley, then get some sleep. Some feral cat bit
Alley's tail last week, and she has an abscess on it now. We took her to the vet.
They shot antibiotics and painkillers in her, and they're both supposed to last for
two weeks. I appreciate not having to give a sneaky cat pills, but where's that
option for humans? And her butt is staying inside at least until she gets
vaccinated. Couldn't vaccinate her during that visit because she had a fever.

<p>

I hope your cat recovers okay.

Have a good day now, and a good night.

Hello again, Keith,
<p>
That is a standard A.A. trick. 
<a href="orange-letters355.html#promotion" target="_blank">The A.A. promoters
constantly publish articles in professional journals</a>,
encouraging the criminal justice system and the rehab
system to send people to A.A., telling lies about how good A.A. is at sobering

<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;We didn't force anybody to attend A.A. meetings.&quot;

Brainwashed...really??? I was drinking 2 quarts of alcohol a day (in the
end) call it what you will but I am no more religious than I was
previously. I have now been sober for several years, I had time before but
I never let go of fighting AA on everything, Including Bill Wilson's
activities

<p>
<font color="blue">
The fact that you were drinking suicidally immense quantities of alcohol, until
you finally chose to quit drinking rather than die, does not in any way show that A.A.
makes alcoholics quit drinking.  Congratulations on your several years of sobriety.
I'm glad you decided not to commit suicide after all. I made the same decision too.
<p>
The fact that you broke down and &quot;stopped fighting A.A.&quot; just means
that you were desperate enough to surrender your life, your will, and your mind
to the cult. And that is why you won't be honest and realistic about the facts now.
</font>
<p>
Yes there are crazy people in AA, at the Ford factory, in the medical
field, living next door so what! That is part of life on this planet.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And that is minimization and denial. Denial that A.A. is fatally flawed.
Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.
<p>
Arguing that A.A. is okay because there are crazies and perverts everywhere is as
bad as arguing that because there are pedophile perverts in the Catholic Church, it should
be okay to have perverts teaching in our schools, preying on our children. No, it isn't okay.
And it isn't okay to have a criminal organization exploiting sick addicts.

</font>
<p>
The bottom line was it works. There is no more effective way of treating
alcoholism for one who has lost the choice whteher he drinks or not.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No it does not work. That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">the Big Lie</a>
of Alcoholics Anonymous.  We have been over
that again and again and again, but brainwashed A.A. members will not stop repeating
that lie.

<p>
Even a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous  &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. George E. Vaillant  &#8212;  proved that A.A. does not work at all, and
just raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.

Charles Bufe wrote a book &quot;AA Cult or Cure&quot; where he determined the
political structure was wonderful and he also did not determine it to be a
cult. As a member AA is an offer not a demand. I tell people AA may not be
for you I don't know. I tell them I really don't care if they do it or not.
My expereince is that it does work. No one at anytime EVER tried to talk me
into believing in any scripture or what God was ...it was entirely a
personal affair.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. You are ignoring the second edition of the book. In the first edition,
Charles Bufe was hesitant about calling A.A. a cult. 
But then the Steppers attacked him mercilessly for even mild criticism of their
favorite cult, and then a Stepper torched his garage to
destroy his files on Alcoholics Anonymous.
In the second edition, Charles Bufe was not so reluctant to call A.A. a cult. 
<p>
A.A. is not an offer when people are forced into it. A.A. is not an offer when
a treatment center pulls a bait-and-switch trick and sells A.A. instead of real
treatment.

The fact that no one tried to talk you into believing in Bill Wilson's god does not
change the fact that lots of other people have had it happen to them.
And it wasn't just talk, it was pressure and coercion.
I just received a letter from a fellow who is suing for that:<br>
<a href="orange-letters355.html#Jeff_F" target="_blank">

<p>
Then check out the A.A. Horror Stories for lots more stories of such abuse
of A.A. newcomers:<br>

<p>
Especially check out:<br>

After I gave birth I had severe postpartum depression. I had not
healed from the birth and my sponsor told me not to take any medication.
...
My sponsor had said that god would heal me and when god wanted me
to sleep I would.</a>

As soon as I divulged that &quot;The God of my understanding&quot; is God Almighty</a>
(God The Father, God The Son, God The Holy Spirit) &#8212;
I noticed a HUGE change.  I experienced being ostrasized, I was keenly made aware
that I was the &quot;joke in the room&quot;.... people laughed when I &quot;shared&quot; anything. I saw
people in the room nodding their head, rolling their eyes at the ceiling,
snickering, putting their finger up to their nose and looking in my direction.  
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters239.html#horror" target="_blank">
I believe I have a very real Faith in God and what goes on in those rooms is at best, a very diluted version of Christian Principles in action...... and at worse, nothing short of evil.

<p>
Why you attack something that has saved the lives of a countless amount of
people is baffling. If you don't like it leave it be.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>A.A. has not saved countless lives. A.A. does not work. A.A. kills more people than it saves.</b>
<p>
That has been shown over and over again:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma found that A.A increased binge drinking</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found that A.A increased the rate of rearrests</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Walsh found that A.A increased the cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant, who went on to become an A.A. trustee, found that A.A. did not increase sobriety in alcoholics at all, not even a little bit, but it did raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
</ol>
<p>
The fact that you see a few sober people with several years of sobriety at meetings only
shows that some sober people are attending the meeting. You don't know what made them
get sober.  The truth is, they quit drinking because they chose to. 
The fact that they yammer about
how A.A. saved their lives shows that they have been hoodwinked and indoctrinated into
believing and repeating falsehoods. Yes, they have been brainwashed.
<p>
Then of course there is the status thing. When someone with several years of <i>Time</i>
speaks at a meeting and
delivers the standard rap about A.A. and God saving him, he gets status and
group acceptance and
Brownie Points and admiration of the newcomers. If he tells the truth, and says
that he got himself sober by determinedly sticking to the decision to not drink
any more, and that the 12 Steps and God didn't do anything for him, he gets hated
and ostracized and maybe even attacked.
So which do you hear more at meetings?
</font>
<p>
What would you do if lets say your son or daughter was drinking and
couldn't stop..just tell them to not drink no matter what? And lets say
they couldn't do that...what would they have to lose?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I would talk to them about the damage that alcohol does, and remind them that
alcohol is one of the worst of drugs. And I'd send them to SMART and SOS.
And have them read Jack Trimpey's books, like <i>The Small Book</i> and 
<i>Rational Recovery</i>.  Heck, I'd have them read my entire
<a href="orange-top10.html" target="_blank"> &quot;Top 10&quot;</a>
 list of books.
<p>
Then I would point them to the discussions of how I and others quit:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>
<p>
In addition, they are not powerless over alcohol... &quot;just couldn't stop&quot;.
Addiction is a choice.

</font>
<p>
Even Carl Jung believed that alcoholics of the hopeless variety need to
have some sort of spiritual expereince and he was a man of science and
medicine.

<p>
<font color="blue">

Bullshit. That is one of the lies that Bill Wilson made up. Carl Jung never said
any such thing. That whole story about Carl Jung telling Rowland Hazard that he must have
a spiritual experience or he would die was just Bill's Bull, another scarey fairy tale
intended to fool and frighten people into joining Bill's cult.
<i>&quot;The Big Bad Booze Bogeyman will get you unless you believe in Bill's religion.&quot;</i>
<p>
If you think that Jung said it, find the quote in his writings.
It isn't there.
Lots of us have been searching <i>The Collected Works of Carl Jung</i> for years,
searching for anything like Jung proclaiming that alcoholics must have a spiritual
experience, and Jung never said that.

<p>
Scaring patients with threats of death was what Dr. William Silkworth did, not Carl Jung.
That was not Jung's style.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then came that little man that we who live in this area saw so much, him with the kind blue eyes and white hair, Doc Silkworth. You'll remember that Doc said to me, &quot;look Bill, you're preaching at these people too much. You've got the cart before the horse. This 'white flash' experience of yours scares those drunks to death. Why don't you put the fear of God into them first. You're always talking about James and <i>The Varieties of Religious Experiences</i> and how you have to deflate people before they can know God, how they must have humility. So, why don't you use the tool of the medical hopelessness of alcoholism for practically all those involved. Why don't you talk to the drunk about that allergy they've got and that obsession that makes them keep on drinking and guarantees that they will die. Maybe when you punch it into them hard it will deflate them enough so that they will find what you found.<br>

UPDATE: In response to this letter, I went to the library and got a bunch of Jung's books,
to see what he really said. Here is:
<a href="orange-Jung.html" target="_blank">What Carl G. Jung really said about treating alcoholism</a> 
</font>
</font>
<p>
What do you believe would be better for the person who can't stop? And lets
say they have tried what you suggested?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I already listed better things above.
<p>
Again, you are repeating Bill Wilson's bull about &quot;just can't stop&quot;. That isn't
how it works.   People drink when they wish to, and stop when they really want to.
<p>
The single biggest factor in whether someone will quit drinking (or doping or smoking) is
<b><i>MOTIVATION</i></b>.  People do not quit bad habits until they <i>really</i> want to
quit doing it.
Just saying, &quot;I want to quit,&quot; is not good enough. As soon as the
withdrawal and the cravings hit,
the guy changes his mind and goes back to indulging his addiction.
He is doing just what he wants to do at that minute. He is not powerless.
He is making a choice.  People need a really strong reason to quit an addiction;
they must be strongly motivated to override a bad habit that they have had for years.

<p>
I was in the same boat. I supposedly just couldn't quit drinking and smoking,
I had failed repeatedly, and backslid on smoking more times than I could count, and 
it was killing me. I had been drinking for 20 years and smoking for 30.
<p>
Then the doctor told me to quit drinking or die, choose one.
And I was so sick that I could believe him.
I thought it over for a while, like a month, and got some more alcohol and drank on it
and thought about it some more, and then I decided to live, so I quit everything.
All at once. Just like that. Now I have 12 years off of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.  
And I am so much healthier and happier. Life is good.
<p>
Addiction is a choice. Drinking is a choice. It's a bad choice, but it's a choice.
So is cigarette smoking (which Bill Wilson never quit). So is taking drugs
(<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Hartigan6" target="_blank">which Bill
Wilson also did, <i>after</i> he got &quot;sober&quot;</a>).
<p>
And millions of people have quit those bad habits without joining a cult religion.

Sent to a 12 Stepper, they will probably 'delete'....

<p>
I spent 19 years in the 12 Step Program of AA and a year in NA. I was a
co founder of NA in Spanish in 1988 in Guatemala City, as local
Guatemalan AA meetings it was forbidden then to speak of drug use. In
New York City I was active in chairing Beginners Meetings using
&quot;Living Sober&quot; instead of the Big Book, more common sense, that was
squashed by the powers that be. I also sponsored several ex convicts
from the Bowery Residence Program as I had been homeless myself. I
volunteered with AA World Services and brought the first AA literature
to then Communist Poland in 1982 to be translated and we donated
literature in Spanish to groups unable to afford them and in 1992 our
English language AA groups in Mexico City sent literature to the first
Cuban AA group. Was proud of all this of course, made many friends in
AA.
<p>
However by 1994 could no longer tolerate much of what I heard and
saw in AA meetings. The last straw was all that I had shared in
confidence in my home group was spread all over town and at one point my life
was threatened. I no longer COME, I CAME TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS
EMPOWERED AND NOT 'POWERLESS' AND I CAME TO, AWOKE TO THE FACT AA WAS
NOT FOR ME!!!! I am Abstinent and Atheist, Moral without 'prayer' and
coping with life without listening to either Psycho or &quot;God&quot; BABBLE.
<p>
Best to all of you, the 5 to 10% who stay in AA, and to others, do not
drink and drive, you will be remanded to AA, a Religion!

From:  	&quot;JG&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank you for the gift of sanity<br>

<p>
I wrote a letter long ago. But I did just want to drop a note &#8212; you saved
my sanity. I had spent years drinking way too much and finally thought that
I'd had enough. Sadly, I was ignorant of what AA truly was. I relied on the
fallacy of their public face. I thought that I would find support in a
welcoming environment to help me be a better person. How wrong I was.

<p>
I entered a sober living facility in december of 2011. I was required to
attend 5 meetings a week, and to attend house meetings twice a week. I soon
discovered that these were not healthy people I wanted to emulate &#8212; but a
social circle of self congratulating hypocrites who quickly showed their
true colors. My activities were closely monitored and made a discussion
piece for the other roommates. I was instructed to only take 1 class a
semester at the local junior college (I was returning to school after a
long hiatus), since anything more might damage my sobriety. (Also, because
that's how the house owner ran his sobriety, and thus it's the best
possible way.) I was instructed to find a god, but when I attempted to
rekindle an interest in Buddhism was told that I should instead give the
program a chance first since I did not know best. I had a sponsor, who was
a friend of the landlord, thrust upon me &#8212; and was castigated when I did
not regularly call him at 6pm sharp even though my job usually happened at
those hours.

<p>
Speaking of my job &#8212; I had sought out many better office jobs, but was told
that I needed a low level starting job for my sobriety. So I became a
bagboy at a supermarket. I was told that this would give me the skills for
sobriety I needed. I was told not to rush my improvement. How wrong they
were. This held me back and kept me trapped in their home.

<p>
Your site was a saving grace during that time. It was reassuring to see the
misgivings I held private put into writing. I truly think you saved my life
and sanity during those days. I am intellectual by nature, and never
trusted AA's war on intelligence. My first sponsor dumped me because of
that and I am ever thankful &#8212; too many people give up resilience and free
will to this cult. I don't malign current practitioners &#8212; anything that
gives their life improvement should be celebrated. I merely hope they will
one day see that they are the keys to their own destiny.

<p>
These days I'm free. I live my life unburdened by their threats of &quot;Jails,
hospitals, and death&quot;. Any time I see one of them on the street I get to
say I'm doing great and watch them desperately rationalize that I'm either
in denial, damned, or soon will be.

<p>
And I wouldn't trade places with a single one of them.

<p>
(If you publish, which you can, just put me as JG)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello JG,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments, and congratulations on your
freedom and sanity.  I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
And I'm really happy to hear that you escaped from the madhouse.
<p>
I'm adding this letter to
<a href="orange-horrors.html" target="_blank">the list of A.A. Horror Stories</a>.
It's a fair warning of what can happen in &quot;half-way houses&quot;.

<p>
The sentence about &quot;watch them desperately rationalize that I'm either
in denial, damned, or soon will be&quot; gave me a laugh. Yes, I know that experience
too. I can't count how many of them have said that I'm going to relapse <i>real
soon now</i> because I'm not practicing the 12 Steps, and I dare to criticize
A.A. and Bill Wilson:
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment99" target="_blank">
&quot;You will still relapse. Somebody with a resentment as big
as yours can't help but go back out.&quot;</a>
<p>
(Although I'm not hearing that so much lately. After 12 years, I think they got
tired of waiting.)
<p>
Have a good day now.

BLOG NOTE: 2013.06.10:  There is a very interesting thread over in the forum,
about ASAM.  ASAM is the &quot;American Society of Addiction Medicine&quot;, a club
for fallen doctors who have lost their licenses to practice medicine because of
drug and/or alcohol problems, and who have &quot;recovered&quot;
through the 12 Steps, and who are now scheming to foist their religion on
everybody else.  There is an scholarly paper listed there that is well-documented,
and it explains how ASAM has weaseled itself into a position where it can pass
judgement on other doctors as the judge and jury for all addiction issues in
medical personel. See:

Bill Wilson's 10 COMMANDMENTS.

<p>
1. Thou Shalt Not Fall in Love With The Old Timer:

<p>
This is the most common newcomer mistake. The thing to remember is that this is a
sexual release for the Old Timer/Sponsor. Their goal is to get as much sex from the
newcomer as possible in the shortest amount of time so they can move to the next
Newcomer. Most Sponsors/Old Timers take the emotional attention/declarations of love
the wrong way. Just because he says you are cute doesn't mean that he wants to marry
you. Sponsors/Old Timers will tell a newbie anything she wants to hear to get laid.
They are there dominate and that's it. Don't let it go to your head.

<p>
2. Thou Shalt Not Spend Your Rent Money:

<p>
Whenever you go to a meeting, it's a good idea to budget how much you plan to spend.
If you can afford 100 bucks, that's all you should bring to the meeting. You don't
want to be put out on the street because someone confessed on how he is struggling
financially and you couldn't stop handing him/her money. The Sponsor/Old Timer is
not going to return the money and is not going to feed your family. And seriously,
do you really want to explain to your wife that you can't take her out to eat
because your Sponsor took your last 200 bucks? I think not. Be smart about it and
don't spend more than you can afford.

<p>
3. Thou Shalt Not Touch The Old Timer in the meeting:

<p>
However, some Old Timers/Sponsors will let you touch them. But most will not. A good
rule of thumb to follow is to let the Old Timer/Sponsor take the lead. If a 13
stepper is sitting 5 feet in front of you, his body language is saying &quot;hands off
bitch&quot; Then you have the ones that will grind down directly next to you or grab your
hands and put them where he wants them. Those are my personal favorites because an
interactive meeting is the best meeting. Sometimes he will put your hand near his
crotch, but don't fall for that age old trick and do not under any circumstances
touch it in the meeting. That will get you kicked out the meeting pretty damn fast
and probably earn you a good serenity rant as well. Just sit back and enjoy the
ride.

<p>
4. Thou Shalt Not Pay Attention To Those Who Question The Dogma:

<p>
At just about every meeting I've been to, the Angry Person talks shit. Don't let
that affect your good time. While he makes his gay jokes and berates the Old Timers
for not thinking straight, stay focused on the reason you came: Sex. After all, you
are in recovery and you can do whatever you want. Don't let the fear of
embarrassment cause you to get pressured into not kissing your Sponsor's arse.

<p>
5. Thou Shalt Not Get Drunk:

<p>
A Old Timer/Sponsor getting drunk at a meeting is a risky prospect. Firstly, the
alcohol may cause you to pay attention to an ugly or fat Newcomer. You know what
they say about lowered inhibitions. Secondly, if you are in an inebriated state, you
are far more likely to do something stupid like touch the your previous sponsee. You
don't want to go that route. Finally, the money that you will spend on drinks could
be put to far better use by buying the pretty newcomer that coffee. Some Old Timers
would suggest drinking beer because it costs less than liquor and you have a much
greater chance of staying sober. A side note I feel I must add is that LSD and
Belladonna does not make you drunk!

<p>
6. Thou Shalt Not Use Plastic:

<p>
Another common Old Timer/Sponsor mistake I see way to often. Don't bring your credit
or debit card into a meeting. All that's going to do is create an electronic trail
of your whereabouts. Imagine your wife's surprise when she gets the monthly bill and
sees a $500 charge to a jewelry store for jewelry she did not get. Don't think
you'll be out of the doghouse anytime soon. Hit up the ATM before you even get near
the meeting. It's just smarter and also more fun to use cash. You can't tip a
prostitute with a credit card receipt, nor will they take your plastic, all of them
prefer money in the color green for all transactions.

<p>
7. Thou Shall Pick Wisely:

<p>
This one is very important. You know what you like. If you like short girls, get
one. If you like big booties, by all means pick that one. Nothing sucks worse than
hitting a newcomer you are not attracted to in the first place. They are going to
ask you for a advice, but please listen to the little voices in your head and
politely decline to be their sponsor. And if your dream girl is on the other side of
the meeting, don't settle for the closest thing to you. You will not be satisfied.
It also is not a good idea to sponsor a newcomer because she reminds you of your
girlfriend or wife, really bad mistake. You can see that at home, you are 13th
Stepping an newcomer to give you a brand new experience. Once you become a 13 Step
pro like I am, you can spot the girls that are going to be the freakiest. Make sure
that's the newcomer you hit on every single time. You can also sample a variety of
different skin tones and body types without repeating yourself. So pick wisely. As I
have said in the past, AA meetings are very similar to a &quot;meat market&quot; leaving the
Old Timer/Sponsor with many choices and combinations.

<p>
8. Thou Shalt Not Infringe On Another's Sponcee:

<p>
One of my pet peeves about meetings Old Timers/Sponsors who don't hit on their own
Sponcees. These characters will sit up in the meeting all night and hit on your
meat. It is well within your right to do this, but if I am spending my precious time
on a Newcomer, don't stare at your Sponcee. Keep your eyes on the stage; this is my
table dance. And please, do not talk to me during my dance. I can't count how many
times I've heard someone buzzing in my ear about one thing or another while I was
getting a dance. I know she's hot, that's how come I'm paying. Leave me alone and
get your own dance.

<p>
9. Thou Shalt Not Use Your Last Name:

<p>
No good can come from using your real name. I've seen Sponsors/Old Timers give out
their last name, phone number and place of employment to newcomers. Why? This serves
no purpose other than to potentially mess up your happy home. If a 13th Stepper
would have used a fake name, he could have at least chalked all coincidental
situation up to mistaken identity. This also goes for email lists. Don't give them
your real email address or you will be getting messages from crying newcomers for
the rest of your natural life. For some reason, you just can't unsubscribe from a
newcomers mailing list no matter how hard you try. Bottom line is this: newcomers
are encouraged not to use their real names so why should you?

<p>
10. Thou Shall Hand Your Friend A Newcomer:

<p>
There are unspoken rules when going to meetings with a friend. You have to get him a
newcomer, especially if this is his first time. This is mandatory even if he has
more girls than you. This shows that he is your friend and you will look out for
him. The newcomer has to be super dirty too. If you organize him a shag from the
obligatory ugly girl at the meeting, you are really sending the wrong message
altogether. If you get your friend a newcomer, and he doesn't do the same for you,
he is a moocher, y'all should part ways, because you're better off going to the
meeting by yourself.

<p>
So, in review, follow these commandments and your next 12 Step experience can become
your best 13th Step experience. One other thing to remember is that there will be
many female Old Timers/Sponsors at the meeting, usually they are there just to have
a good time, and not to find a man. Leave them alone and focus on the girls that you
know will be taking their clothes off. If you are looking to meet women, you should
check out a dating service. But if you are looking to have a good time at the
meetings and shag as many newcomers as possible, follow Bill's 10 Commandments.

Subject:  	Hi<br>

<p>
I read many of your pages online tonight. I disagree with your fundamental premise,
that people do not have a spiritual component and I believe this flaw in your logic
undermines your entire treatise. You can not prove there is no god and neither can I
prove that one exists.

Hello Jim,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
My &quot;fundamental premise&quot; is certainly not that humans do not have a &quot;spiritual component&quot;.
I never said that there is no spirituality or no God.
What I said is that there is no Santa Claus, and you cannot get what you want by praying or
begging a ghost or fairy or stone idol or &quot;god&quot; to give you the goodies.
<p>
Personally, I have been studying and loving spiritual things since the nineteen-sixties. That is
why I object to criminal frauds, like cult leaders, selling fake spirituality to the young people.
If I didn't love spirituality, I wouldn't care so much about the con artists cheating people in
the name of God.

<p>
I have actually been talking about spirituality all through my papers. I do not
try to push it, because I'm not trying to sell any religion, but I never denied
spirituality or its existence. What I have said is that Bill Wilson did not have
any, and he was a lying fraud who exploited sick people, and that is unforgiveable.
<p> Some of the things that
<a href="orange-letters22.html#spirituality" target="_blank">I said in my pages</a> are:
<p> <blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One Indian judge said, while ruling on a dispute between two brothers, both of whom claimed to be
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_guru_special" target="_blank">The One And Only Perfect Master</a>&quot;, that
&quot;There is no lower crime than deceiving men in the name of God&quot;, and I
feel the same way. (It turns out that the judge was quoting Mahatma Gandhi.)<br>
</font>
</blockquote> 
<p> And
<a href="orange-rroot180.html#Gandhi_claims" target="_blank">Mahatma Gandhi said</a>, 
<p> <blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I know of no greater sin than to oppress the innocent in the name of God.<br>
== Mahatma Gandhi, April 1947.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>All Men Are Brothers</i>, Mahatma Gandhi, page 73.

</blockquote>

of Alcoholics Anonymous is this one:
