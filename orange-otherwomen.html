Ordinarily, I could hardly care less what a man does with his women friends,
or whether he has a mistress as well as a wife.
There are millions of men who are cheating on their wives, and I'm not going
to say a thing about them.
But when a group holds a man up as an example of how to live a
spiritual life, and even claims that
the man is some kind of a saint and a prophet, a man who wrote
divinely-inspired books while being
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot030.html#Bill_guided" target="_blank">guided by
God</a>&quot;,
but who turns out to be a
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_to_heretics" target="_blank">hypocritical</a>
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">thieving</a>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">lying</a>
philanderer,
then I think we can safely cancel his application for sainthood.
And I believe that it casts a lot of doubts on his religious
teachings.

<p>
Bill Wilson cheated on his wife Lois with many different
women, both before and after sobriety.
He even cheated on her while she worked in Loesser's department store
to support him.
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;I'm going to a meeting&quot;</i></font>
was often a double-entendre when Bill Wilson said it.
Bill actually invented the old A.A. tradition of <i>Thirteenth Stepping</i>
the pretty women who come to A.A. meetings seeking help for alcoholism.
<i>(First you teach them the Twelve Steps, and then you take them to the bedroom
and teach them the Thirteenth Step....)</i>

<p>
Even worse, Bill Wilson's treatment of his wife Lois can only be
described as &quot;cold, cruel, vindictive, and heartless&quot;.

<p>
<a name="TomP"> </a>
<a name="Hartigan1"> </a>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#TomP" target="_blank">Tom Powers</a>
helped Bill Wilson to write Bill's second book, <i>Twelve
Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>. Francis Hartigan, who was Lois Wilson's
private secretary and confidant, recently wrote a biography of
Bill Wilson. For it, Hartigan interviewed Tom Powers, and quoted Tom as
saying that he had urged Bill to quit his smoking and womanizing:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;All the while we were working on the 'Twelve and Twelve',"
Tom said, &quot;I would argue with him, 'you're killing yourself.
And think about what you're doing to Lois!'&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
While other people I spoke with insisted that Lois never knew about
Bill's affairs, Tom insisted that &quot;Lois knew everything and
she didn't have to guess about it, either. A lot of people tried
to protect her, but there were others who would run to Stepping
Stones to tell Lois all about it whenever they saw Bill with
another woman.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I asked Tom how Bill reacted when Tom would insist that Bill's guilt
over his infidelities was responsible for his depressions.<br>
<a name="mother"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I think that was the worst part of it,&quot; he said.
&quot;Bill would always agree with me. 'I know,' he'd say.
'You're right.' Then, just when I would think we were finally
getting somewhere, he would say, 'But I can't give it up.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;When I would press him as to why the hell not, he would
start rationalizing. What would really kill me is when he'd say,
'Well, you know, Lois has always been more like a mother to me.'
Which somehow was supposed to make it all right for him to cheat
on her.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Tom himself had also been sexually compulsive even after he quit
drinking, and he found it very hard to change his behavior. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Tom said that it took him five years after he quit drinking to change
his behavior in this area, and for five years after that, he tried
to get Bill to change, too. &quot;Besides what he was doing to
the women he was chasing and to Lois, his behavior was a huge source
of controversy in AA,&quot; Tom said. &quot;He could be very blatant
about it, and there were times when it seemed like the reaction to
a particularly flagrant episode would end up destroying everything
he had worked for. But then people would scurry around and
smooth things over, or cover it all up.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
According to Tom, Bill's behavior caused some of his most ardent
admirers to break with him. Eventually, Tom broke with Bill, too.<br>
<a name="Powers_quits"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I told him that I still considered him to be my sponsor, but
that I didn't want to work with him anymore. I said that I hoped
we could be friends, but I didn't want to have anything more to do
with him publicly. I just couldn't go on feeling as though I was
in any way supporting what he was doing to Lois &#8212; and to himself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Bill said, 'Fine. I feel the same way about you, too,' and
we shook on it. As though it were some mutually agreed upon parting
of the way, with fault on both sides. Which was a real switcheroo,
you know. I think he knew that I saw right through it, but I guess
it made him feel better not to have to take responsibility for
destroying what had been a very enjoyable and productive working
relationship.&quot;<br>

with his grandiose proclamation on page 58 of the <i>Big Book</i>
that A.A. members must

Bill Wilson taught that he was

by having sex with all of the pretty young women who came to the
meetings.
That's an interesting excuse for cheating on your wife,
one of the more novel ones, but it doesn't wash.
<p>

Notice how such an <i>&quot;Admission of Powerlessness&quot;</i> is really
just a veiled excuse to continue such behavior:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I can't quit jumping
on all of the pretty young women at the meetings,

Bill Wilson was habitually unfaithful to the wife who was supporting him,
both before and after sobriety.
Bill was such an outrageous philanderer that the other elder A.A. members
had to form a &quot;Founder's Watch Committee&quot;, whose job it
was to follow Bill Wilson around, and watch him, and
break up budding sexual relationships with the pretty young things
before he publicly embarrassed A.A. yet
again.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The impression that he was a ladies' man seems to have come from the way he sometimes
behaved at AA gatherings. When Bill wasn't accompanied by Lois (or later, Helen), he could
often be observed engaged in animated conversation with an attractive young newcomer.
His interest in younger women seemed to grow more intense with age. Barry Leach,
who knew Bill nearly thirty years, told me that in the 1960s he and other friends
of Bill's formed what they came to refer to as the &quot;Founder's Watch&quot; committee.
People were delegated to keep track of Bill during the socializing that usually
accompanies AA functions. When they observed a certain gleam in his eye, they
would tactfully steer Bill off in one direction and the dewy-eyed newcomer in another.<br>

Susan Cheever reported the same thing in her biography of Bill Wilson,
although she tried hard to downplay its importance,
using standard stereotypical alcoholic
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a></i>
to claim that it didn't matter much and wasn't any big deal:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many people in A.A. worried that Bill Wilson's sexual behavior would be
discovered and reflect badly on the movement.
Whether or not they were necessary, self-appointed &quot;Bill watchers&quot; usually
stayed close to him at meetings and conferences to prevent him from interacting
with attractive newcomers in a way that might appear unseemly.<br>

<i>What kind of a healer or spiritual leader is that? You have to follow him around and watch
him, to prevent him from sexually exploiting the newcomers?</i>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Also notice how Susan Cheever totally ignored and avoided the important
issue of the harm done to the women alcoholics who got used by Bill for his
sex games and self-aggrandizement.
Susan Cheever wouldn't touch that issue; she only wrote about how some
silly worry-warts unnecessarily fretted over Bill's behavior, worrying that it might
&quot;reflect badly on the movement&quot;, and &quot;might appear unseemly&quot;.
Susan Cheever writes as if the women in recovery didn't
matter and didn't have any feelings worth worrying about, and their
recovery, their health, their lives, and their continued sobriety was of no consequence,
not even worth mentioning.
The women whom Bill Wilson used and exploited were treated like irrelevant objects both
in Bill's sex games and in Susan Cheever's mind.
</font>

<p><br>
Bill Wilson just didn't want to be bothered with the hard work of
resisting temptation. Like so many other phony gurus, he lived a life of
hypocritical irresolute self-indulgence, preaching &quot;spirituality&quot;,
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#too_good" target="_blank">absolute purity</a>&quot;,
&quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, and self-sacrifice to others
while indulging in all of the pleasures of the flesh himself &#8212; with
the sole exception that he does appear to have finally quit drinking
alcohol after it nearly killed him.
(And some people dispute even that, and say that
<a href="orange-letters67.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">Bill never got more than a year of sobriety</a>.
Susan Cheever herself reported that
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Cheever_book" target="_blank">Bill Wilson died screaming for whiskey</a>.)

<p>
So just how was Bill's behavior an example of a life
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#only_spiritual_experience" target="_blank">lived
on a spiritual basis</a>&quot;</i>?

Besides the fact that he hypocritically yammered the words
&quot;God&quot; and &quot;working selflessly&quot; all of the time,
and held s&eacute;ances and
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">played with Ouija boards</a>,
just what was &quot;spiritual&quot; about William G. Wilson?

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another alleged mistress has been outed by novelist Carolyn See
in a memoir of her familial drinking life.
It seems that Wynn C. [Corum], See's father's second wife (he was her
fifth husband), had once &quot;come within a hair-breadth
of becoming the First Lady of AA.&quot; For a while during
the late 1940s or early 1950s, &quot;she and Bill had been a mighty
item.&quot; A tall and buxom beauty, with pale skin, high
cheekbones, red hair, and turquoise eyes, Wynn &quot;was a
knockout, and she knew it, and dressed like a chorus girl.&quot;
Unfortunately, Bill was already married, but he struck &quot;a
hard but loving bargain with Wynn: &quot;He wouldn't, <i>couldn't</i>
marry her, but he'd put her in the
Book.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>19</sup></font>
That is, he included her story, &quot;Freedom From Bondage,&quot;

of the Akron A.A. archives.<br>

&quot;Freedom From Bondage&quot; became the matching bookend for
&quot;Bill's Story.&quot; The narrative was retained in the
third edition (1976) but shifted to the penultimate position.
At one point the author quips that her history of multiple
marriages (she admits to four) &quot;caused the rather cryptic
comment from one of my A.A. friends ... that I had always been
a cinch for the program, for I had always been intrested in
mankind, but that I was just taking them one man at a time&quot;

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Full disclosure: I grew up with a stepmom, Wynn, who had been fully prepared
to marry Bill. He disengaged himself but put her &quot;story&quot; in the second
edition of &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous,&quot; in which the accounts of recovering
alcoholics were included for the first time. She married my dad, her fifth
husband, as a sort of consolation prize. Wynn was a wonderful woman, but
I saw AA then from the point of view of a prissy, still-sober teenager,
<font color="#9F0000">
watching members bicker about whether taking an aspirin for a headache
constituted a &quot;slip,&quot;</font>
listening to stories of their friendships with a
Personal God &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#operator" target="_blank">I told God to have you call
me today</a>,&quot; my stepmother would
say after I moved out of the house. (And what could I possibly say? Maybe
she had, and maybe He did.) But they didn't worry much about sex. &nbsp; ... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So I want to say for the record (and you won't find it on &quot;Grapevine,&quot;
or any other AA publication) that early AA, at least on the West Coast,
was full of raucous men and women bursting with the physical energy that
drying out brings. I speak now for Wynn (the Wynn I knew), who wrote &quot;Freedom
From Bondage&quot; in the Book, and who, though she had five husbands, considered
the high point of her life her amorous connection to Bill.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Wynn stood on our front steps one bright Christmas morning enthusiastically
kissing a different handsome AA swain as others crowded past them, pushing
inside to a party, where they would drink tomato juice and laugh like banshees,
delirious with joy. They had found God (as they understood Him), and as
long as they stayed away from booze and aspirin, they were okay; they were
in the clear. They weren't ashamed of sex; they gloried in it.<br>

that they even considered <i>taking a few aspirin</i> to be a slip from perfect sobriety?

<a name="two_women"> </a>
Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary, went on to describe how
Bill Wilson used his leadership position in A.A. to get more women:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As the AA office staff expanded in the 1940s, Bill seemed to take
an active part in its recruitment efforts. One longtime AA member
told me that at first she didn't know why in 1946 Bill hired her
and another young woman AA member. &quot;Neither of us could type
or take dictation,&quot; she told me. Then, one night soon after
they were hired, Bill took both women to an AA meeting. He sat
between them and, all during the meeting, he had a hand on one leg
of each of the women.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There was also a young woman Bill had begun an affair with whom
he subsequently hired for the AA office. She worked at the office
from about 1948-1950. She seems to have been very much like Bill's
mother, a strong-willed, stubborn woman who was very insistent about
having her way. Because everyone knew she was Bill's mistress,
she expected to get it.
Apparently, she did not appreciate the extent to which AA is a
democracy. Bill's recommendation might have gotten her the job,
but her behavior became so disruptive that in 1950 the AA trustees
told Bill that she could no longer work there.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
While Bill often seemed to feel free to take advantage of whatever
opportunities were available to him as AA's head man, a number of
people who were close to him told me that there were times when
he was painfully aware of the threat his philandering posed to
everything he had worked for. Barry Leach, a longtime AA member
who was a close friend of Bill's for more than twenty-five years,
Jack Norris, and Nell Wing all said that Bill had let them know
how badly he felt about his unfaithfulness to Lois. That he
nevertheless was seemingly unable to control himself filled
him with despair and self-loathing at times and left him feeling
unworthy to lead AA.<br>

how people see and respond to them.

And they must stay in control because
loss of control evokes their fear of insanity.

Bill Wilson's own psychiatrist,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">Dr. Tiebout,
criticized Bill Wilson</a> by saying that he had been trying to live
out the infantilely grandiose demands of &quot;His Majesty the Baby&quot;.

There is a chapter in the <i>Big Book</i>, titled
&quot;<i>To Wives</i>&quot;, which is ostensibly advice from the
alcoholics' wives to other alcoholics' wives.
But Bill Wilson did not let his wife Lois write the <i>To Wives</i>
chapter of the <i>Big Book</i>.
In spite of the fact that the chapter begins with the words:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;As wives of Alcoholics Anonymous, we would like you to feel
that we understand as perhaps few can&quot;</i></font>,
<br>
Mr. Wilson actually wrote the entire chapter
himself while pretending to be his own wife,
because, he said, he didn't trust Lois to get it right.
He mumbled something about how she wouldn't get the style the
same as the rest of the book. Lois felt hurt by the rejection,
but that was the way it was going to be.
<p>
Bill had already asked Doctor Bob's wife Anne
if she would write the chapter, but she declined. Apparently, Bill
felt that Anne Smith was qualified to get the style right, but his own wife
Lois was not. That gives us an indication of Bill's opinion of
his wife's intellect.

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Bill would not let even Lois, who was dying to do so, write the chapter
titled &quot;To Wives.&quot;
After all, she was the wife who had endured Bill's drunken years and the
houseful of alcoholics he was trying to wrestle into sobriety.
&quot;I have never known why he didn't want me to write about the wives,
and it hurt me at first,&quot; she said.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Nan Robertson, pages 70-71.</font>


<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Bill originally thought, as he told Bob, &quot;that Anne [Smith] should do the
one [chapter] portraying the wife&quot; (DB, 152).
When she demurred, Bill did it himself, much to the chagrin of Lois, who
reasonably supposed she was better qualified than her husband on this
score. In fact, Lois had hoped Bill would ask her to write not only
&quot;To Wives,&quot; but also the following chapter, &quot;The Family Afterward.&quot;
But when &quot;she shyly suggested this, he said no; he thought the book,
except for the stories, should all be written in the same style&quot;
(LR, 114).<font size="-1"><sup>9</sup></font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Obviously, Bill's excuse to Lois makes no sense at all, given his first
offering the assignment to Anne Smith. Lois, who kept her disappointment
to herself, later recalled: &quot;I have never known why he didn't want me to
write about the wives, and it hurt me at first; but our lives were
so full that I didn't have time to think about it much&quot; (LR, 114).
It may be that Wilson himself was feeling so insecure in his new authorial
role that he shied from creating a potential rivalry with his wife.
Or, perhaps, he was nervous about what she might say!<br>

Bill Wilson's imagination was certainly vivid: Even while Bill was
still busy just writing the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i> in
late 1938 and early 1939,
he was describing wives who were already jealous of the book because the
book had already cured their husbands of alcoholism <i>in just a few weeks</i>.
There's nothing like being confident that your book is going
to revolutionize the world, and have <i>magical</i>, nay,
<i><b>miraculous</b></i> effects on alcoholics.
<p>
That's insane delusions of grandeur, again. It's also characteristic of a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
narcissistic personality disorder</a>.
<p>
(The real question is, <i>&quot;Was Bill Wilson
totally disconnected from reality, a completely delusional raving lunatic,
or was he just coldly lying and manufacturing propaganda to promote his new cult
and make some money by selling the book?&quot;</i>)

<p><br>
But Bill didn't have a very flattering view of wives, did he?
Normal, sane, loving wives are overjoyed when their husbands are cured
of a life-threatening disease. Wives don't usually resent the
doctor for curing their husbands of cancer, tuberculosis, or diabetes.
But here, in Bill's weird world of A.A., the wives are all resentful and jealous of
God, The <i>Big Book</i>, and the alcoholics who cured their husbands
of alcoholism in just a few short weeks.
<p>
And Bill Wilson just never came off it, either. In his next book, written
a dozen years later, he wrote the same things again:
<p>
<a name="wife_unhappy"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After the husband joins A.A., the wife may become discontented, even
highly resentful that Alcoholics Anonymous has done the very thing
that all her years of devotion had failed to do.
Her husband may become so wrapped up in A.A. and his new friends
that he is inconsiderately away from home more than when he drank.
Seeing her unhappiness, he recommends A.A.'s Twelve Steps and tries
to teach her how to live.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 118.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The little woman becomes &quot;discontented, even highly resentful&quot;,
supposedly because A.A. has fixed her husband when she couldn't. So, Bill says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He tries to teach her how to live.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Isn't that a laugh? Bill Wilson suicidally drank his brains out for years
and stole money from his wife's purse to go buy more booze
while she worked in Loesser's department store and supported both of them,
year after year,
but now that Bill has become a religious maniac who is obsessed
with a cult religion, spending all of his time at meetings
and recruiting, he suddenly imagines that he is a religious leader who is
qualified to teach his wife how to live, as if she didn't already know.
Again, Bill Wilson was displaying
glaring evidence of his
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">
<i>narcissistic personality disorder</i></a>.

<p>
Note the interesting little goof, the small slip of the tongue that betrays the
truth: If the Twelve Steps were really a formula for quitting drinking,
then there would be no reason for the guy to teach the Twelve Steps to
his sober wife.
She has no need of a quit-drinking program &#8212; she doesn't drink.
Only if the Twelve Steps are something else, like a
formula for building up a cult religion, or a formula for that religion's
&quot;way of life&quot;, is there a reason for him to teach the Twelve Steps
to his wife, to &quot;teach her how to live.&quot;
Bill Wilson just revealed that Alcoholics Anonymous is a cult religion, not
a program for sobriety.

<p>
Then Bill told us how &quot;the wife&quot; was jealous and felt neglected:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Still another difficulty is that you may become jealous of the attention
he bestows on other people, especially alcoholics. You have been starving
for his companionship, yet he spends long hours helping other men and
their families. You feel he should now be yours.<br>

Chapter 8, <i>To Wives</i>, page 119.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="Lois_rem"> </a>
<a name="ftnt05_ret"> </a>
Reading between the lines, we can see that Bill's wife Lois was
very unhappy with his maniacal obsessive behavior. She admitted,
in her own book, <i>Lois Remembers</i>, that she got fed up
and screamed,
&quot;<a href="#old_meetings">Damn your old meetings!</a>&quot;,
and threw a shoe at
him.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt05">5</a></sup></font>
She might have been getting tired of supporting the unemployed bum.
She had to support him while he drank, and then, after he sobered
up, he decided that he liked proselytizing for the Oxford Group religious cult,
and then for Alcoholics Anonymous, indulging his messianic complex
and going to lots of meetings where he was a big fish in a small
pond, much more than working for a living, so she still had to support
him for many more years, while he did nothing but his &quot;spiritual
practices.&quot;
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#unemployed" target="_blank">In 1944, Clarence Snyder complained</a>
that Bill Wilson had been unemployed and mooching off of
his wife Lois or the Alcoholics Anonymous organization for nine years.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We have elsewhere remarked how much better life is when lived on a
spiritual plane. If God can solve the age-old riddle of alcoholism,
He can solve your problems too.
We wives found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted with pride,
self-pity, vanity and all the things which go to make up the self-centered
person; and we were not above selfishness or dishonesty. As our husbands
began to apply spiritual principles in their lives, we began to see the
desirability of doing so too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first, some of us did not believe we needed this help.
We thought, on the whole, we were pretty good women, capable of being
nicer if our husbands stopped drinking. But it was a silly idea that we
were too good to need God.
Now we try to put spiritual principles to work in every department
of our lives. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We urge you to try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to
your husband as the radically changed attitude toward him which
God will show you how to have. Go along with your husband if you
possibly can.<br>

Notice how Bill had Lois supposedly saying to the other wives,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;We urge you to try our program...&quot;<br>
</font>
Once again, Bill Wilson says that Alcoholics Anonymous is not a quit-drinking
program for Daddy, or a therapy program for alcoholics, or a self-help group
for alcoholics.
It's a religion for the whole family. (It's <a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">the Oxford Group</a>.)
And of course it was not the wives' program; it was Bill's.
<p>
<a name="ftnt06_ret"> </a>
<a name="temper_tantrums"> </a>
Bill declared that the wife needed to get a new attitude towards her husband.
Again, the narcissistic Bill Wilson felt that his wife Lois was being unfair to him
when she criticized his drunken behavior like throwing screaming temper tantrums,
tearing up the house, kicking out door panels, and throwing a sewing machine at
Lois.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt06">6</a></sup></font><p>

<font color="#9F0000">
<b><i>So, Bill said, she needed God to give her a new attitude.</i></b>
</font>
<p> 
Bill didn't say anything about the husband needing to
get a new attitude towards the wife that he was treating so poorly.
<p>
Mind you, when Bill Wilson wrote those pages of the <i>Big Book</i> in
December 1938 or early 1939, Lois was
working in Loesser's department store in New York City to support both herself and Bill,
while he did nothing but go to A.A. meetings,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">thirteenth step</a> and sexually exploit
the pretty women who came to the meetings seeking help for a drinking problem,
and write this garbage where he slandered his long-suffering wife,
calling her proud, vain, self-centered, selfish, dishonest, and unspiritual
&#8212; <i><b>in print</b></i>.
<p>
If Lois irritated Bill by asking him to go get a job, quit messing around
with other women,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">quit chain smoking cigarettes</a>,
or quit acting crazy,
he responded by calling her selfish, dishonest, unspiritual, and a nag.
<p>
Such hateful, arrogant behavior goes far beyond bad manners. It is
flat-out insane &#8212; completely delusional.
Bill grandly proclaimed he was a great spiritual teacher with a mission,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#Bill_guided" target="_blank">guided by God</a>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Broad_Highway" target="_blank">walking on the Broad Highway,
hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe</a>,
while he was treating his wife like that.
Bill Wilson was nuts.

<p>
Then the paranoid Bill Wilson even attacked the wives  &#8212;  and by implication, Lois  &#8212; 
accusing them of being unfaithful. That is a classic textbook example of psychological <i>Projection</i>.
Bill cheated on Lois, so Bill accused Lois of cheating. Bill put these words into the mouths of the wives:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Dr. Alexander Lowen described the behavior of a narcissistic patient named Erich:

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another aspect of narcissism that was evident in Erich's personality was his
need to project an image. He presented himself as someone committed to &quot;doing
good for others,&quot; to use his words.
But this image was a perversion of reality. What he called &quot;doing good for
others&quot; represented an exercise of power over them, which,
despite his stated good intentions, verged on the diabolical.
Under the guise of doing good, for instance, Erich exploited his girlfriend:
He got her to love him without any loving response on his part. Such
exploitativeness is common to all narcissistic personalities.<br>

Bill Wilson just couldn't stand his wife Lois criticizing him, nagging him, or

Then Bill Wilson even went so far as to basically endorse the idea of
divorce, by insisting that A.A. must even come before a man's marriage:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If there be divorce or separation, there should be no undue haste
for the couple to get together. The man should be sure of his recovery.
The wife should fully understand his new way of life. If their old
relationship is to be resumed it <font color="#9F0000">must</font>
be on a better basis, since the former did not work. This means a
new attitude and spirit all around. Sometimes it is to the best
interests of all concerned that a couple remain apart. Obviously,
no rule can be laid down. Let the alcoholic continue his program

Yes, the wife must &quot;fully understand&quot; that A.A. will now dominate his
life. The A.A. cult comes first &#8212; it's his &quot;new way of life&quot;,
and she gets second place in all things.
And they shouldn't get back together until she knows her place and
is willing to stay in her place. And if she won't approve of the A.A. program,
then the marriage should end.

<li>
Let's see now: He drank too much alcohol. That was the problem.<br>
<li>
Bill Wilson lied and drank and philandered and stole money out of his wife's purse to go
buy more booze...<br>

So how was that the fault of his wife or their former relationship?<br>

Again and again, we see that Bill Wilson just couldn't stand the idea that
his wife might be a better person than he was, so Bill repeatedly slapped
her down with veiled attacks, talking about how &quot;the wife&quot; was
selfish and silly and dishonest and jealous, and needed God to give her a new attitude....

<p>
<font color="black">
And if they don't get back together, the ex-wife gets this advice:

So ladies,
even if A.A. breaks up your marriage, you should still join Al-Anon

&quot;a spiritual way of life&quot;. Any woman who could not only
tolerate an obnoxious lying thieving philandering drunkard like Bill Wilson,

Oh really? If the husband will stop drinking or moderate just because his wife smiles
sweetly and never criticizes him for his binges and drunken escapades,
then she must be the real cause of his drinking. It must be her fault that
he drinks.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#colored_grievances" target="_blank">Her nagging
must be driving him to drink</a>,
and her keeping a civil tongue in her

Elsewhere in the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson even gave us good old
boys instructions on how to cheat on our wives and get away with it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Perhaps we are mixed up with women in a fashion we wouldn't care to have advertised.
We doubt if, in this respect, alcoholics are fundamentally much worse than other
people. But drinking does complicate sex relations in the home.
After a few years with an alcoholic, a wife gets worn out, resentful, and uncommunicative.
How could she be anything else?
The husband begins to feel lonely, sorry for himself.
He commences to look around in night clubs, or their equivalent,
for something more than liquor.
Perhaps he is having a secret and exciting affair with &quot;the girl
who understands.&quot;
In fairness we must say that she may understand, but what are we
going to do about a thing like that?
A man so involved often feels very remorseful at times, especially if he is
married to a loyal and courageous girl who has literally gone through hell
for him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Whatever the situation, we usually have to do something about it.
If we are sure our wife does not know, should we tell her?
Not always, we think...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Our design for living is not a one-way street. It is as good for the wife as for
the husband. If we can forget, so can she. It is better, however, that one
does not needlessly name a person upon whom she can vent jealousy.<br>

In another chapter of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson advises us good old boys not
to confess our little
infidelities to our wives in our Fifth Step, where alcoholics are supposed to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;admit to God, to ourselves, and to another person the exact nature of
our wrongs&quot;</font>, because:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<i>&quot;I can't tell my wife about all of my mistresses because
it will hurt her feelings and make her unhappy if I do.&quot;</i></font>

Earlier in the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson had made the grandiose declaration
that A.A. is &quot;a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty&quot;
<font size="-1">(page 58)</font>, but now we shouldn't tell the wives anything.

<p>
<a name="no_infidelity"> </a>
And Bill didn't confess his infidelities, either.
Even after all of that, Bill Wilson still had the nerve to deny that he
was ever unfaithful to his wife. Bill wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There were many unhappy scenes in our sumptuous apartment. There had been no
real infidelity, for loyalty to my wife, helped at times by extreme
drunkenness, kept me out of those scrapes.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Edition, <i>Bill's Story</i>,
page 3.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such behavior and gross dishonesty goes far beyond bad manners. It is insane &#8212; completely
delusional. Bill Wilson imagined that he could deceive,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">embezzle</a>, philander, and sexually exploit
women newcomers to A.A., and then lie about it, and still be an inspiring
spiritual teacher to his followers.
<p>
<center><table width="96%" border="4" bordercolor="blue" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font color="blue">
And the apartment was not &quot;sumptuous&quot;, either.
Everything that Bill Wilson wrote in those two sentences was untrue.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Clinton_Street" target="_blank">The house at 182 Clinton Street</a>
was a rather ordinary old house, not a sumptuous palace, and then
Bill and Lois got evicted from that for non-payment of the mortgage, and were homeless.
So they went and crashed at Henry Parkhurst's house.
After living off of the charity of various A.A. members for two years,
sleeping at one friend's house after another, and camping on a friend's property
in the country when the weather was good, they ended up living
upstairs in a tiny single room in the first A.A. clubhouse in New York &#8212; a room so small
that a bed barely fit in there. So much for Bill's &quot;sumptuous apartment&quot;.
<p>
<li>
The part about &quot;many unhappy scenes in our sumptuous apartment&quot;
is deceptive and inaccurate, too.
<ul>
<li> Why would there be many unhappy scenes if Bill Wilson wasn't
cheating on his wife?
<ul>
<li>
Was Bill slyly accusing Lois of making many false accusations of infidelity, just
bitching and nagging and creating unhappy scenes for no good reason?
<li>
Is Bill telling us that he came home one morning and Lois was furious
because Bill had been out all night with another woman, and Bill said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Yes, it's true that I was with her, and yes we ended up sleeping together,
but nothing happened because I was too drunk. We passed out.&quot;</font><br>
That excuse wouldn't work after Bill Wilson sobered up and founded
Alcoholics Anonymous and started using A.A. meetings as meat markets.
Bill wouldn't have been too drunk then.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
Bill and Lois' contemporaries like Tom Powers tell us that Lois was not
the kind of woman that would make a scene. She was too proud to humiliate herself by
making a big scene over Bill's infidelities. She was the kind of person to
keep quiet, and bottle it all up inside.
The only story of her exploding in anger is when she threw a shoe at
Bill and screamed, &quot;Damn your old meetings!&quot;
Bill Wilson explained away that incident by writing
that Lois was unhappy because she was
&quot;<a href="#old_meetings">jealous of God and A.A.</a>&quot;, not that
she was unhappy because Bill used A.A. meetings to pick up more cute
young things.
</ul>

<p>
<li> And Bill had absolutely no &quot;loyalty to his wife&quot;
that would &quot;keep him out of those scrapes&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
The degree to which everything that Bill Wilson wrote was
either a lie or just completely
delusional grandiose nonsense borders on the unbelievable.
<p>
What's even more unbelievable is how many A.A. members believe that
Bill Wilson's insane ravings are Holy Scriptures, inspired by God.

<p><br>
Then Bill Wilson did the
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a></i>
tap-dance some more,
insisting that his little infidelity problem couldn't really be all that bad,
because if it was, he wouldn't be able to avoid relapsing and
returning to drinking alcohol.
And Bill said that he ignored the &quot;fanatics&quot; who told him to
knock it off and behave himself &#8212; Bill Wilson declared that
<font color="#9F0000"><i>only God could judge him</i></font>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
God alone can judge our sex situation. Counsel with persons is often
desirable, but we let God be the final judge. We realize that some people
are as fanatical about sex as others are loose. We must avoid hysterical
thinking or advice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Suppose we fall short of the chosen ideal and stumble?
Does this mean we are going to get drunk? Some people tell us so. But this
is only a half-truth. It depends on us and our motives. If we are sorry for
what we have done, and have the honest desire to let God take us to better
things, we believe we will be forgiven and will have learned a lesson. If we
are not sorry, and our conduct continues to harm others, we are quite sure
to drink. We are not theorizing. These are facts about our experience.<br>

<p>
Well, there had to be something wrong with Bill Wilson's logic, because
he screwed every female he could get his hands on, both before and after
sobriety &#8212; he never stopped it &#8212; but there is no hard evidence that Bill
returned to drinking after he finally quit in December of 1934 (although
<a href="orange-letters67.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">there are rumors</a>...).
So apparently, Bill Wilson <i>was</i> able to both sin and stay sober.
<p>

<center><table width="87%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
Although there is much doubt about whether Bill Wilson was really able to both sin and stay sober.
Many people have said that Bill Wilson relapsed constantly, and he never got more than a year sober,
and he died screaming for whiskey.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters67.html#never_sober_for" target="_blank">A correspondent wrote</a>, 
<blockquote>

<p>
And the biographer Susan Cheever, who was allowed access to the secret sealed archives of A.A.,
and who read the nurse's log book describing Bill Wilson's last days, wrote that
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Cheever_book" target="_blank">Bill Wilson died screaming for
whiskey</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On James Dannenberg's log for December 25 &#8212; Bill Wilson's last Christmas Day
&#8212; at six-ten in the morning,
after a long night, the patient &quot;asked for three shots of whiskey,&quot; Dannenberg noted.
He also noted that Wilson was quite upset when he couldn't have what he asked for.
There was no whiskey at Stepping Stones. A few days later he became belligerent
and tried to punch the nurse. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the seventh of January, Nurse Dannenberg noted that Bill had been visited by
some family members and that after the visit he and Lois had an angry argument.
The next morning Bill again asked him for whiskey. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
By the fourteenth of January, Bill Wilson, a man who hadn't had a drink in
almost thirty-seven years, a man who had discovered what is still the only
successful way to treat alcoholism, was asking for whiskey again.<br>

<p><br>
Bill Wilson did the same <i>Minimization and Denial</i> tap-dance again
in his next book, written a dozen years later,
declaring that some unnamed philandering &quot;A.A. alcoholic&quot;
was now behaving himself because the 12 Steps
&quot;often&quot; gave &quot;fine results&quot;:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The alcoholic, realizing what his wife has endured, and now fully understanding how much
he himself did to damage her and his children, nearly always takes up his marriage
responsibilities with a willingness to repair what he can and to accept what he can't.
He persistently tries all of A.A.'s Twelve Steps in his home, often with fine results.
At this point he firmly but lovingly commences to behave like a partner instead of
a bad boy. And above all he is finally convinced that reckless romancing is not a
way of life for him.<br>

couldn't handle the super-high moral &quot;principles&quot; of the Oxford Groups with
their &quot;Absolute&quot; standards like
<i>Absolute Purity</i> and <i>Absolute Honesty</i> (like Bill could):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find sobriety,
nothing else. They clung to their other defects, letting go only

Somehow, Bill Wilson seems to have imagined that he could cheat
on his wife and not tell her, and even write lies about it in the
<i>Big Book</i> (page 3), and that didn't violate those Absolute Purity and
Absolute Honesty standards.
<p>
While Bill may have been <i>Absolutely Loving</i> towards his current
mistress, he sure wasn't towards his long-suffering wife Lois.
All he did with her was attack her and slander her, even in print,
calling her a selfish, silly, dishonest nag in the <i>Big Book</i>
while she worked in Loesser's department store to support his lazy
philandering unemployed ass.

Mathew J. Raphael had this to say about the above <i>Big Book</i>
quotes:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
What's truly incredible in Wilson's handling of adultery is his
impersonation of a woman's point of view in the chapter that he
would not permit Lois to write. &quot;To Wives&quot; opens with
three brief paragraphs that ostensibly turn the ball over to the
women, who then appear to speak in a first-person plural voice,
which is really Wilson's ventriloquism. &quot;Sometimes there
were other women,&quot; he writes as if he himself were one of
those loyal and courageous girls. &quot;How heartbreaking was
this discovery; how cruel to be told that they understood our
men as we did not!&quot; (AA, 106). Later, still in narrative
drag, he seems to hold women accountable if their men should stray.
&quot;The first principle of success is that you should never
be angry.&quot; Even if your husband becomes so unbearable
that you have to leave him temporarily, you must try to &quot;go
without rancor.&quot; You should definitely not tell him what
to do about his drinking; for he will dismiss you as &quot;a nag
or a killjoy&quot; and use your interference as an excuse to
drink all the more &#8212; or worse! &quot;He will tell you he is
misunderstood. This may lead to lonely evenings for you.
He may seek someone else to console him &#8212; not always another
man.&quot; (AA, 111). The menacing coyness of this threat
is calculated to put any uppity wife in her place, which is
to be seen, perhaps, but definitely not to be heard.<br>

Speaking of <i>Minimization and Denial</i>, Susan Cheever was pretty
good at it too. In her recent biography of Bill Wilson, she tried every
which way to rationalize Bill's behavior. She even implied that it was
because Lois Wilson looked old:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A photograph of Bill and Lois in 1957 shows a raffish man who might be
in his thirties with his long arm around a kindly looking white-haired
woman with her blouse buttoned up to the chin. He was sixty-three, and she
was sixty-seven. They look like mother and son.<br>

Ah, so Lois Wilson looked like an old <i>Hausfrau</i>, did she? And that made it okay
for Bill Wilson to take advantage of his leadership position in A.A. to
seduce every pretty young thing who came to an A.A. meeting seeking
help to survive alcoholism?

<p>
Twelve-Step morality is really something else.

if she thought that Bill looked young and sexy &#8212; and in his thirties.
<p>
I've seen that photograph, and Bill did not look anything like 30. He looked
sixty-ish, just like Lois. And that was a terrible photograph, showing Lois at
her worst. Also remember that Bill Wilson was a philanderer most all of his adult life,
not just in 1957. Lois didn't always look that frowsy, and Bill didn't always
look very good, either. Lois stayed faithful to him even when he was just a stinking
derelict drunkard.

Susan Cheever must have something wrong with her eyes.
Bill looked like a gaunt burned-out chain-smoking old alcoholic in that

make it okay for Lois to cheat on her husband and start collecting a stable of
sexy handsome young studs for her amusement?)

any A.A. old-timer who has a frowzy, dumpy-looking wife to thirteenth-step

Alcoholics Anonymous was supposedly a therapeutic program that in some

It is grossly unprofessional and highly unethical for a doctor,
psychiatrist, or counselor to take advantage of his position of authority
to seduce female patients.
Real doctors who do that get their license to practice medicine revoked.
They get kicked out of the healing profession. They even get put in prison for
molesting patients.
<p>
But since Bill Wilson wasn't a real doctor or therapist, just a cult leader with a quack cure,
he didn't have any license to yank.
And there is no oversight board that monitors the ethics or behavior
of Alcoholics Anonymous sponsors or leaders. They can do anything they wish
to the newcomers.
And that is one of the big problems with Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">And such blatant sexual exploitation continues, right now</a>,
in Washington DC, Arizona, California, Minnesota, Florida, New York, and lots more places.


<p>
Such thirteenth-stepping behavior can be very harmful to the female newcomers.
Instead of getting therapy and healing, they get screwed and exploited,
and leave A.A. with bitter, resentful feelings.<br>
<font color="blue">
<ul>
<li> So, according to the standard A.A. dogma, they will invariably relapse
and drink again, because they left A.A., and because they &quot;have a resentment&quot;.

<li> So they will die drunk because they are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<li> So Bill Wilson was apparently killing sick women who came to A.A. seeking help.
</ul>
</font>
<p>
Bill Wilson had to be a heartless monster to keep doing that to the young women
who came to Alcoholics Anonymous seeking help for their alcoholism. When they
were weak and shaky and cloudy-headed and still unsure of their sobriety,
Bill Wilson was scheming to
get into their pants. Bill Wilson exhibited total disregard for their welfare or
their recovery. They were just so much fresh meat to him.
<p>

When it came to serious life-or-death matters of alcoholism or sobriety, Bill Wilson
exhibited a total lack of compassion, morals, or ethics.
He callously disregarded the health and welfare of the pretty young women newcomers,
and just concerned himself with his own pleasures.
Bill Wilson was a sexual predator, not a helpful therapist.
That is not the behavior of a great man, or a prophet, or a spiritual man,
or a religious man, or a healer.
And that sure isn't
<b><i>&quot;rigorous honesty&quot;</i></b> or <b><i>&quot;unselfish spirituality&quot;</i></b>.
And it isn't the much-ballyhooed
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes" target="_blank"><i>Four Absolutes of

<p><br>

<a name="Hartigan4"> </a>
And then there was Helen Wynn. She was special. The other women
didn't last long, but the affair with Helen lasted many years,
right up to Bill's death.
Bill Wilson even ended up
<a href="orange-BillWill.html" target="_blank">putting her in
his will</a>, giving her ten percent of the estate that was going to
his wife Lois.
<p>
Helen Wynn was a former actress and a very attractive woman.
She was 22 years younger than Lois Wilson.
Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's personal secretary, described them as:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The two women were
bright and bold, attractive and accomplished, but where Lois seems
always to have been self-sufficient and rock-steady,
Helen could be mercurial and needy.
Like Bill, she seems always to have possessed a restlessness
that couldn't be more than temporarily slaked.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W., A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous
Co-Founder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan, page 193.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill and Helen seem to have met at an A.A. meeting. Soon after, Bill got
Helen a job at the <i>AA Grapevine</i>. Most everyone in the office
knew that Helen was hired because she was Bill's girlfriend.
But unlike most of the women whom Bill hired, Helen proved to be
competent and capable, and worked her way up, over a period of
years, to become the magazine's editor.
Bill and Helen became frequent companions whenever he was in
New York, and Helen sometimes
accompanied him to A.A.-related events.
Whenever Bill came to New York, he would stay overnight in a hotel,
and Helen stayed with him.

<p>
After Helen left the <i>Grapevine</i> in 1962, Bill continued to
contribute to her support. He wanted the A.A. trustees to route
a portion of his royalty income directly to Helen, but the
Trustees refused, and told Bill to pay his mistresses himself.
Bill was furious at their effrontery.
<p>
<a name="ftnt04_ret"> </a>
<a name="Cheever3"> </a>
<a name="SC3"> </a>
Then Susan Cheever reports something rather odd:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some old-timers remember that Bill had larger financial dreams for Helen.
They worked together on
<a href="#loved_LSD">the experiments and distribution of LSD</a>
and niacin,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt04">4</a></sup></font>
which became one of Bill's late-life enthusiasms. Some A.A. old-timers say
that Lucille and David Kahn, the couple who financed much of the LSD research,
were poised to give a lump sum for a research headquarters to be run by Helen.
Ultimately, that didn't happen.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then the A.A. trustees &#8212; the new truly democratic government of A.A. &#8212;
refused to allow Helen the percentage of the <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>
royalties that Bill had earmarked for her.<br>
<hr>
231 <i>that didn't happen:</i>
This is part of Tom Powers's story about why he stopped working with Bill.
&quot;Helen went crooked,&quot; he said. Powers says he went to the Board and
kept them from allowing Helen to get the money for an LSD research headquarters.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Helen went crooked&quot;?</i></font> What on earth does that mean?
To toss out a generalized slur like &quot;Helen went crooked&quot; is just
gossip-mongering. Specifically, what crimes did Helen Wynn commit that made her unfit
to be the leader of the LSD research foundation?
For the sake of accurate history, we should know. Unfortunately, so many of the participants have
died that it is unlikely that we shall learn that.
Perhaps the answer is locked in the sealed historical archives at the A.A. headquarters, but the
A.A. leaders aren't about to open the archives of the secret history of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
In 1968, with his emphysema growing worse, Bill and A.A. executed
<a href="orange-BillWill.html" target="_blank">a new will</a>
that called for Helen to receive 10% of his book royalties, and his wife
Lois the other 90%, after his death.


<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="Nan_rationalizes"> </a>
Nan Robertson wrote a history of Alcoholics Anonymous that just
repeated the standard A.A. party line about everything. She glossed
over Bill's philandering with these words:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Wilson's marriage to Lois Burnham in 1918 lasted until his death at
the age of seventy-five in 1971. She believed in him fiercely and
tended his flame. Yet, particularly during his sober decades in A.A.
in the forties, fifties and sixties, Bill Wilson was a compulsive
womanizer. His flirtations and his adulterous behavior filled him
with guilt, according to old-timers close to him, but he continued
to stray off the reservation. His last and most serious love affair,
with a woman at A.A. headquarters in New York, began when he was in his
sixties. She was important to him until the end of his life, and was
remembered in a financial agreement with A.A. This affair, and
experiments in spiritualism, LSD and megavitamin therapy, scandalized
A.A. trustees and other veterans in the home office. Some felt Wilson
was not upholding the high ideals of the organization and was
muddying its singleness of purpose and peddling crackpot ideas to
a membership that worshiped him. But his qualities of generosity,
openness to change and humility about his own shortcomings were
particularly endearing. &quot;I never heard him bitch about anybody,&quot;
said a man who joined A.A. in the 1940's and was one of its first
homosexual members. &quot;It wouldn't have mattered if I was a
cannibal. He was delighted by eccentricities. His attitude was, 'Here's
one of the camels that wandered into our tent! Aren't people
wonderful?'&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Another said, &quot;As a failed human I couldn't stand it if I
thought Bill hadn't failed. I couldn't live up to a perfect
example.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Nan Robertson, page 36.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

What a white-wash. So Bill's cheating on his wife, repeatedly,
constantly hurting Lois, was just a little
&quot;straying off the reservation&quot;, huh?
Just like a fun-loving naughty little Indian, sneaking off of the
reservation to go get some beer, right?
<!--
(That <i>&quot;&quot;straying off of the reservation&quot;</i>
phrase might have
been one of Bill's inventions, because both Hartigan and Thomsen
also used the same phrase in their biographies of Wilson,
to describe his philandering behavior.)
-->
<p>
And
<font color="#4f007f">
Bill &quot;never bitched about anybody&quot;</font>?<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li> What about
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#screw_Hank" target="_blank">Henry Parkhurst</a>?
Bill pretty much destroyed him after Hank criticized Bill for
taking all of the credit for writing the <i>Big Book</i>
(and all of the <i>Big Book</i> money, too). Bill took
Hank's share of the <i>Big Book</i> profits, and left Hank
to die drunk and pennyless.<br>
<p>
<li> What about atheists? Ed, who was
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_to_heretics" target="_blank">ostracized and exiled to an alcoholic death</a>
for refusing to believe in God as Bill Wilson dictated, might have
been very surprised to hear that.

<p>
<li> Also read chapter four of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank"><i>We Agnostics</i></a>, to
see how tolerant Bill was of people who held different religious
beliefs than his own.
<p>
<li> And Bill Wilson sure
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Ernie_Galbraith" target="_blank">bitched about Ernie Galbraith</a>,
Doctor Bob's son-in-law and A.A. Number Four:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I gave up on you a long time ago, you son of a bitch!&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Children Of The Healer; The Story Of Doctor Bob's Kids</i>,
Bob Smith and Sue Smith Windows, page 54.</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
And Bill had to be less than perfect so that other A.A. members
could relate to him? Well, he had already failed in business and
in life, and he was already
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#Bill_imperfect" target="_blank">far less than perfect</a>
&#8212; he was an alcoholic,
a fraud, a failed Wall Street hustler, a quack healer, a phony holy man,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">a felonious embezzler</a>,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock2" target="_blank">a stock swindler</a>,
a madman, an evil cult leader,
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">a narcissistic pathological liar</a>
&#8212; so he didn't really need to keep on cheating on his wife Lois
just to make the other A.A. members feel comfortable...
<p>
Isn't that one of the lamest rationalizations you've ever heard?

<p>
<a name="Cheever4"> </a>
<a name="SC4"> </a>
<br>
Susan Cheever came up with some equally inept rationalizations of
Bill Wilson's behavior:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sexual compulsion itself is still a confusing secret in our world, even today.
On the one hand, we chuckle at a sexually compulsive athlete, and even encourage
the circumstances of their compulsion, but on the other hand we decry it.
Our girls must be virgins, but they must also be sophisticated.
Our boys must be man enough to score, but also gentleman enough to provide
emotional and permanent financial support for any child they father.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the world in which Bill Wilson matured, men were assumed to be
sexually driven creatures whose bestial desires could only be tamed by
the love of a gentle woman, if they were lucky enough to find that gentle
woman. In the meantime, bundling boards &#8212; low walls clapped into place across
the bed &#8212; and homemade chastity belts were used to keep the beast at bay.
In a world without birth control, the general result was men trying to express
themselves sexually and women, terrified of pregnancy, failing to respond.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>My Name Is Bill; Bill Wilson &#8212; His Life And The Creation Of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Susan Cheever, page 228.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What a crock of B.S. It is highly unlikely that Bill Wilson ever saw a bundling board
or a chastity belt in his life. Besides, notice the propaganda trick that Susan
Cheever is playing &#8212;
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert" target="_blank"><i>create a diversion</i></a>:
<ol>
<p><li> Sexual compulsion is not &quot;a confusing secret&quot;.
There is nothing confusing or secret about getting horny and wanting
to grab a pretty woman.
<p><li> Bill's behavior had nothing to do with the lack of birth control
pills or women being afraid of sex. Bill was scoring anyway.
(And more primitive, less reliable, means of birth control, like the
diaphram and the sponge, did exist.)
<p><li> Odd Victorian attitudes about sex, like thinking that men were sexually driven
beasts, did not justify Bill's exploitative behavior either.
Bill Wilson was not living in the Victorian age &#8212; he was living in the
Roaring Twenties, and in the Depression Thirties, and in the Wartime Forties.
Bill Wilson was what he was, regardless of what some old Victorians may
have thought many years earlier.
Bill Wilson controlled his own behavior and deliberately chose which attractive
young A.A. woman to take advantage of next.
<p><li> Bill Wilson was sexually exploiting the pretty women who came to A.A.
to get help to survive alcoholism. Real healers don't screw their patients.
<p><li> Also notice the attempt, in the first paragraph,
to explain away Bill Wilson's predatory behavior with yet another diversion.
Bill's sexual exploitation of female A.A. newcomers had nothing to do
with some unnamed boys' and girls' sexual frustration during another
period of history.
Bill Wilson was a married man who was cheating on his wife,
not a horny young athlete who was compulsively trying to get
some sexual satisfaction from a reluctant girlfriend.
<!-- (And what kind of an example of a sober spiritual life is that?) -->
</ol>
<p>
Then Susan Cheever salted the rest of her book with equally misleading statements
like:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Marty Mann, for instance, kept her [lesbian] sexual preferences a secret
for years. She called herself &quot;Mrs. Marty Mann,&quot; although she wasn't married,
in order to protect her secret.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet when Bill wanted to keep his sexual behavior secret, he was met with controversy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>My Name Is Bill; Bill Wilson &#8212; His Life And The Creation Of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Susan Cheever, page 237.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><b>
That is simply untrue. That is the exact opposite of the truth.</b></font><br>
The early A.A. members were worried that Bill's flagrant non-stop
philandering would bring discredit and disrepute down on the fledgeling
Alcoholics Anonymous organization. They wished that Bill's shameless
behavior was more of a secret. They wished that Bill Wilson would quit
advertizing and flaunting it and showing off.
Tom Powers, the co-author of Bill's second
book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, found Bill's behavior
to be so brazen and vulgar that he quit Alcoholics Anonymous in disgust
because he couldn't stomach any more of Bill Wilson's misbehavior, and he
<a href="#Powers_quits">didn't even want to be publicly associated with
Bill Wilson any more</a>.

Many who have an Exhibitionist DNP [Destructive Narcissistic Pattern]
openly solicit admiration for their sexual prowess. They want others to
admire and envy them for being sexually attractive or more successful and
better at sexual games. They seek to be the fantasized lover with many
conquests and a string of broken hearts. This provides them with much
satisfaction and validation that they are superior, worthy, admired,

others except through sexual means.<br>

Nan Robertson said of Bill Wilson:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;But his qualities of generosity, openness to change and
humility about his own shortcomings were particularly
endearing.&quot;<br>
</font>
That is <i>the charismatic charmer</i> at work.
Nan Robertson was unable to see Bill Wilson clearly.
She couldn't even see that Bill was most certainly <i>NOT</i> open
to change. He never stopped philandering, or grandstanding, or taking
all of the money for himself, or demanding his own way about everything.
<p>

The Europe SOS web site had a page that
<a href="orange-cult-sos.html#charismatic" target="_blank">described cult leaders</a>
as:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Cult leaders are often charming, charismatic figures with
above-average intelligence. The &quot;charismatic charmer&quot;
is one their personalities &#8212; a pseudo-personality.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Many cult leaders suffer from borderline, disassociate or multiple
personality disorders. Members feel honored to be with, and be seen,
around them. But their personality can change dramatically in a flash.
Cult leaders are always very disturbed individuals. They are usually
victims turned persecutor, having a history of involvement in other
social, political or religious cults and/or suffering the effects
of a traumatic childhood. Behind their strong and confident exterior
(pseudo-personality) they need their leader position to compensate
for a very fragile sense of self-worth, self-esteem and self-identity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nothing will stand in the way of their visions, schemes and
self-glorification &#8212; not even the well-being of their partners or
children. They manipulate the minds of vulnerable members, extorting
money and sexual favors and/or abusing them psychologically,
physically and/or sexually.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That sounds a lot like Bill Wilson:
<ul>
<li>
Bill Wilson was a charismatic figure with an above-average intelligence.
<li>
He had a history of involvement with another cult, the Oxford Groups, before he started
his own cult.
<li>
He was a former victim turned oppressive cult leader.
<li>
Behind his &quot;strong and confident exterior &#8212; <i>pseudo-personality</i>&quot;,
he was a weak, vain man who couldn't stand his wife criticizing him.
<li>
He had an extremely fragile sense of self-worth,
and he plunged into a deep, crippling, years-long depressions when things didn't go his way.

The idea that Wilson might come and go unnoticed at meetings,
as merely a private A.A. citizen, was literally the stuff of
Hollywood fantasy. At the end of <i>My Name is Bill W.</i> (1989),
the powerful made-for-television movie, James Woods (playing
Bill) is shown slipping anonymously into a meeting. At first
Wilson is piqued to go unacknowledged as the cofounder, but
he quickly suppresses his vanity; after the meeting, as just
plain Bill, he lends a sympathetic ear to another suffering
alcoholic. As the film fades to black, we see Bill,
properly fortified with coffee, beginning what we know will be
a long talk with someone who desperately needs his help.
Lois, beaming with devotion, understandingly absents herself;
she knows Bill must be about A.A.'s
business.<font size="-1"><sup>24</sup></font>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In reality, when Bill W. went to meetings, not only was he
inevitably recognized, but he was also swarmed by admirers
and pressed into telling them his story. Sometimes he would
hold audiences for small groups of the faithful. One old-timer
remembers waiting for two hours in order to spend twenty minutes
with Bill W. at a Boston hotel in 1947. That day more than
two hundred A.A.s were placed in groups of fifteen; each
group was seated in turn in a large lounge, where Wilson
held court. The experience was thrilling; the pilgrim felt as if
he &quot;had been in the presence of some spiritual force.&quot;
Bill's &quot;aura&quot; pervaded the room; he seemed &quot;to be

24. According to William G. Borchert, author of the screenplay,
this incident is based on a true story told him by Lois Wilson,
about a meeting she and Bill attended during the early 1940s
in Barstow, California. Borchert moved the scene forward
chronologically  to 1950, in a way that makes it dramatically
effective but undercuts its historical plausibility. Borchert
also told me that he was aware that the scene in the Mayflower
lobby (see Foreword) could not have happened the way it has
been written. But the legend has become so deeply entrenched,
he felt he had no choice but to follow the myth rather than the
facts.<br>

(Oh, and another reason Bill Wilson was not likely to go unrecognized at any

<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">he often telephoned ahead</a> and arranged

Given the openness of Bill's pursuits, that anyone who was a friend
of Helen's and part of Bill's inner circle could not be aware of
the affair seems hardly credible. However, in spite of his natural
and unassuming manner, many people were unable to see Bill clearly.
Even today, many AA members believe that alcoholism had them in
a death grip, and they talk unself-consciously about the miracle
of their recovery.
During Bill's lifetime, it would seem that nearly all AA members
felt this way, and a great many saw Bill Wilson as a miracle worker.
For every member who criticized Bill for his depressions, there was
at least one member ready to deny that Bill was ever depressed.
For anyone concerned about

of Bill's smoking on his health</a>, others were ready to insist that
he didn't smoke that much, or if he did, it certainly wasn't bothering him.<br>

This biography was written by Lois Wilson's private secretary,
Francis Hartigan. If anybody should be privy to the insider secrets
about Bill's infidelities, it would be Francis.
And he says that Bill was about as faithful as a horny alley cat,
all of his life, both before and after sobriety.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When Bill took LSD, use of the drug was legal. He first took it as a participant
in medically supervised experiments with Gerald Heard and Aldous Huxley
in California in the 1950s. Lois also participated in the first LSD experiments
in California. At Bill's insistent urging, she took LSD herself but always claimed
later not to have felt anything. Bill insisted that she did too feel something
and that she in fact had a very pleasant time. Nell Wing, who took LSD herself during
one of these sessions and was there when Lois tried it, tends to believe Lois.
She explains LSD's lack of impact on Lois by noting that she took much less than the
others had. Father Ed Dowling was among the people who accepted Bill's invitation
to join him in these early experiments. Bill also invited Jack Norris, medical
director for Eastman Kodak and long-serving nonalcoholic chair of AA's General
Service Board, but Norris declined.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is hard to appreciate today the enthusiasm with which LSD experimentation
was initially greeted. Aldous Huxley wrote Father Thomas Merton that LSD might
even be the SOMA he had written about in his futuristic novel, <i>Brave New World</i>,
and that it was deserving of the most serious and thorough scientific research.
Sam Shoemaker wrote to Bill about the wholehearted endorsement of LSD experimentation
by an Episcopal bishop, and Wilson wrote to Carl Jung, praising the results
obtained with LSD and recommending it as a validation of Jung's spiritual
work. (Word was received of Jung's death, and the letter was never sent.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Wilson is thought to have continued experimenting with LSD well into the
1960s. Lib S., a longtime AA member who lived in New York for many years,
told me that she participated in LSD experiments with Bill in the late 1950s
in New York. Marty Mann, Helen Wynn, and others participated in the New York
experiments, which were supervised by a psychiatrist from Roosevelt Hospital.
Lib S. said that the alcoholic participants in the New York researches were
all sober. The purpose was to determine whether the drug might produce insights
that would serve to remove psychic blocks that were preventing people from
feeling more spiritually alive. Each participant had to agree to undergo
extensive debriefing, and all were urged to make detailed notes about what they
were experiencing.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill agreed with Huxley's assessment of LSD's power to open the &quot;doors of
perception.&quot;
He described his first experiences of the substance's effect as being akin
to what he had experienced in Towns Hospital the night his obsession with
alcohol was lifted. Nell Wing told me that her own LSD experiences were something
that she had always valued. Although Nell denies that Bill ever went this far,
other people who knew him during this period said that his initial enthusiasm
for LSD was so great that he thought it should be available to all alcoholics.<br>

<b>&quot;Damn Your Old Meetings!&quot;</b><br>
That is the title of chapter 8 of Lois Wilson's book, <i>Lois Remembers</i>.
Lois' book is also pretty pathetic:
it was probably ghost-written for her, somebody else putting words into
her mouth, yet again, because it came out
in 1979, long after Bill's death, when she was also very
old and frail. The <i>Lois Remembers</i> book parrots much of
the standard party line from the <i>Big Book</i>, including the
&quot;jealous of God and A.A.&quot; story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Slowly I recognized that because I had not been able
to &quot;cure&quot; Bill of his alcoholism, I

<p>
All I can say is: What pathetic, brain-damaged tripe. Any normal wife
would be overjoyed to see her husband cured of a deadly disease. But not
in the weird world of A.A. &#8212; not in the delusional mind of Bill Wilson.
There, the wives are all jealous of God and A.A. (and not simply furious
that he insists on going to A.A. meetings all of the time,
and 13th-stepping the pretty women there,
instead of getting a job).

This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is
very positively slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author
knew Mr. Wilson and worked beside him for the last 12 years
of Mr. Wilson's life. And rumor has it that this book was prepared
from autobiographical tapes that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's
warts, his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his
years-long &quot;dry drunks&quot;...

like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his and Bob's spook

to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping,
clairvoyance, and channeling, LSD use, and publicity-hound megalomania.

She even implies that Bill Wilson was right when he was conducting s&eacute;ances &#8212;
that he really was talking to the spirits of the dead.<br>

ISBN: 0-02-575890-X<br>
LC: RC553.N36L38 1983<br>
LCCN: 83-18794<br>
This is a great book, a real classic. Dr. Lowen advances the idea that
narcissism is not falling in love with one's self, but rather with a
false image of one's self. That small subtle difference actually makes
a very large difference. In the original Greek mythology, Narcissus died
&#8212; starved to death &#8212; because he was obsessed with his own image and
stared at it endlessly.
But as Narcissus approached death, his real emaciated appearance could not have
been very attractive. Narcissus was seeing an illusion, not his true
appearance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Lowen advances the idea that narcissism is often caused
by child abuse and prolonged humiliation and pain in childhood. The child
adopts a persona where he feels no pain and is powerful and invulnerable.
The child thinks, <i>&quot;When I grow up, I'll be so powerful and strong that no
one can hurt me or humiliate me ever again.&quot;</i> Then the child, who grows into
adulthood, spends the rest of his life pursuing and defending an illusion.
Narcissists are obsessed with defending and preserving their image &#8212; they can't
stand it if somebody &quot;makes them look bad&quot; &#8212; they can't stand criticism.
They deny their true feelings and put on a mask of unfeeling, because
they imagine that it will keep them from being hurt again.
Likewise, they completely disregard other people's feelings.
They are obsessed with power and control, so that they can
control the world around them and prevent anyone from humiliating
them again.
Narcissists are often extremely seductive and manipulative people, often charismatic
charmers, and occasionally high achievers as well.
They lie habitually, without giving it a second thought.
They fear insanity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, Dr. Lowen was describing
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Bill Wilson</a>, the
abused son of an alcoholic father and a neurotic mother.

tolerate the least little bit of criticism, and who felt entitled to take the
best of everything for themselves because they were so special, and who threw
