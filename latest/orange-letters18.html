I will not waste your time with the pap and pabulum of religious whimsy but if 
anyone IS doing God's work it is someone like you! I had a really foul time in 
&quot;12-step recovery&quot;. I was about 13 yrs &quot;sober&quot; and started having some problems 
with recurrent nightmares and things that some call post traumatic stress, bla, 
bla, bla... I really wanted to feel differently (stop feeling bad) but I was 
going about it in a way that did not work so well... no matter how much I prayed, 
wrote, talked with a &quot;sponsor&quot;, worked steps, ad nausium... I still felt haunted 
by some shit. I finally got very sick and tired of jerks giving me pat little 
sayings in answer to my queries as to why I felt so lost. I really like your web 
site; it has a lot of things that I personally can attest to the accuracy of.
<p>
 
I really hope you keep your strength and stamina to address 12-stepism as it 
should be addressed. My only question is: ARE THERE MORE FOLKS LIKE YOU? I am 
VERY familiar with professional fellows who address 12-step foolishness (like 
Stanton Peele, etc) but not &quot;just plain folks&quot; as you appear to be.

Hi, John,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. Glad to hear that you are feeling better.
<p>
And as far as doing the Lord's work is concerned, I sometimes like to taunt the
true believers, and joke by asking, <i>&quot;How do you know that the Lord didn't send me to clean
the trash out of the temple?&quot;</i>, although I actually make no such claims... :-)
<p>
About there being more of us, I think that the answer is a very large,
emphatic &quot;YES&quot;. Even the A.A. surveys show that

The vast majority of the people find that they dislike A.A., and they
vote with their feet, and leave.
<p>
You just don't see them or hear from them because they don't write web sites or books
or create any publicity, while the true-believer Steppers do.
The silent majority is silent. But just because the majority doesn't have the inclination,
energy, time, or training to build web sites doesn't mean that they don't know or don't care.
They do.

[Wed, 2 Jun 2004, Liz wrote:]

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
The use of alcohol often stems from undiagnosed post-traumatic
stress disorder and/ or psychogenic amnesia where sobriety prior to
cure
may render the person suicidal and worse off than if they continued
drinking.  I believe that accounts for the suicide rate among those
who
went to AA and got sober. AA may prevent a person getting  cured by
emphasizing symptom alleviation when such symptom alleviation makes
the
underlying illness worse.  I am a living testament that sobriety
prior to
being cured of my underlying PTSD and ruptured psychogenic illnesses
probably would have caused my death.  I am cured now of my underlying
PSTD and ruptured psychogenic amnesia.	As a result of the cure, I
just
gave up needing or wanting to drink or take a drug.  I haven't used
anything for almost five years now. And I never went to AA after the
first meeting years earlier where all I saw was despair.  I never
think
about alcohol or a sleeping pill.  I wake up and love my life every
day
knowing that this day belongs to me and I am free.

<p>
I write my story about the attempted murder/rape I endured
and my
struggle with my illnesses to not vilify AA but to help others, who
like
me, need medical treatment first before they can possibly give up
their
self-medication use of alcohol and /or drugs.  I beg them to get to a
PTSD expert to be tested first for this illness and if tested and
found
to suffer from this illness, to undergo the hypnotherapy treatment
that
saved my life.  My doctors at Stanford never asked me to stop drinking
while I was undergoing treatment although they told me to take no
medications for sleep or anxiety and even advised me to not take
aspirin.
AA telling everyone indiscriminately that they have to stop drinking
is
not good.  It can make a person worse.

<p>
I was subject to an attempted murder/rape in my late 20's.  I
had
no memory of the attack in my bed at 3:00 A.M.	 When I awoke, I was
on
my bed on my stomach and paralyzed from the waist down.  I managed to
drag myself to the edge of the bed and fall off and then grabbing
every
fiber of the carpet that I could hold onto to drag myself with my dead
legs to the kitchen to get ahold of a chair leg and drag myself up to
call for help. I had to have plastic surgery on my face four times.
No
one in my family drank or used any drugs.  I was an attorney when the
attack occurred.  I drank socially at the time.  Over time I started
drinking more.	I became dependent on alcohol to sleep.  Then it was
not
enough. I started taking sleeping pills.  I had no idea that I had a
serious illness.  It was not alcoholism.  Eventually I started to have
seizures.  I was not drinking when the seizures happened.  I was
trying
not to drink when the seizures happened.  I would fall down and not be
able to see, hear, or talk.  I fell into the hands of a quack-quack
who
talked about my mother for two years while I became worse to the
point of
wanting to try and kill myself.  I would wake up in the morning and
have
no sound in my throat and be able to speak in only a whisper.  There
went
my law career.	Quack-quack referred me to AA.	I went to one
meeting.
It was not the religiosity that turned me off.	It was the despair.
In
retrospect I am glad that I never went back.  I might have killed
myself
instead of getting cured of my illness which caused me eventually
just to
not want to take a drink or a pill. I did not and do not need these
things to be happy.  I am happy naturally now.

<p>
Somehow I finally got myself to Stanford Adult Psychiatric
Outpatient Clinic.  Within an hour I was correctly diagnosed with
severe
post traumatic stress disorder and ruptured psychogenic amnesia.  I
knew
what had happened in the attempted murder.  I knew what had happened
and
gave myself amnesia to survive.  The surgeon had told me it was too
dangerous to remember when the police had wanted me to undergo what,
in
retrospect, would have probably resulted in my insanity, to wit,
sodium
pentothal.   But the material over a ten year period of time had
ruptured
and was going to cause my death from my body physically reliving the
attack and causing me seizures.  That or I was going to kill myself
from
alcohol abuse and mixing the alcohol with sleeping pills.  I was a
real
dead man woman walking.  I had survived an attempted murder only to be
dying from the illness it caused. I underwent 18 months of outpatient
treatment two or three times a week for an hour and a half to three
hours
at Stanford with hypnotherapy with a PTSD expert psychiatrist.	My
three
doctors knew from the first session that I had died during the
attack.
Because of posthypnotic suggestions given to me not to remember
anything
that my mind did not want to recall yet, I did not know that I had
died
during the attack until seventeen months later.

<p>
I did not stop drinking right away, but over time,  I just
did
not need or want it.  I noticed first that I would fall asleep real fast
if I drank anything.  That means that my mind is so calm now that I
just
sleep from its effect on me. It got to be no fun to drink as I would
immediately fall asleep.  I now sleep perfectly.  I have no screaming
nightmares.  I am not in a constant state of anxiety.  I guess you can
say that I now have integrated the trauma into my memory and my life.
But that is too clinical.  I remembered that I would have to have a drink
when I felt internally something  cornering me, overwhelming me,
something out of control, something fearful.  I just had to have that
drink to overcome the panic I felt.  It wasn't anything objectively
external.  It wasn't anything actually happening to me.  It could be
something as placid as looking at a pleasant painting.	I now know that
there are reduction cues, or triggers, where something in the
environment, like an electrical jolt, goes right to core of the untreated
memory and rips it open violently so that the pain is just overwhelming.
You have to self-medicate to avoid a heart attack or worse.  So you
have
to get to the memory and treat it first &#8212; what I call a D &amp; C of the
brain &#8212; so that those reduction cues are of no import as there is nothing
of pain for them to jolt into.	 You do no need the drink as you are in
no pain.

<p>
When I had PTSD, I remember the world looked gray.  Everything
was a gray color.  Now everything, even the color gray, is vibrant and
alive with joy and peace.  I hope that your readers will see the
colors
too.

<p>
Try medical treatment first and see if there is something
buried
in you that you need to know and see to feel safe.  Do not go to a
general psychologist or psychiatrist.  Go only to a certified
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Expert and go with hypnotherapy first.
Have no guilt. My advice is that if you feel lousy not drinking, then
drink until you can find out what is making you feel lousy and get to
the
core of the problem and ignore its symptoms until you feel great not
drinking.

Hello Angelle,
<p>
That is the standard propaganda trick of

</font><p>

Who cares whether A.A. is spiritual or religious, it just works.

<p><font color="blue">
Well I care whether it is a cult religion, and

That is the whole problem with it.
<p>
And that is not just my opinion.
Many doctors, including Prof. George E. Vaillant, a Member of the Board
of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc., have found through long and careful testing
that A.A. does not work at all.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709035631/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Vaillant
did an 8-year-long test of A.A.</a>
where he tried his best to prove that
A.A. worked, but in the end he had to report that A.A.
&quot;failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism&quot;.
Meaning: that A.A. did nothing good; that it didn't help the alcoholics at all.
Zero improvement; zilch.
All that A.A. did was kill the patients. A.A. had the highest death rate
of any kind of treatment for alcoholism that Vaillant studied:
&quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709035631/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">our

 It is amazing what lengths people who might have a problem with alcohol go.

<p><font color="blue">
Wrong. Once again, you show what a cult A.A. really is.
That is standard cult characteristic number ten:
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_personal_attacks" target="_blank">Personal attacks on critics</a>.
If someone criticizes your favorite voodoo medicine, you
respond by declaring that he just doesn't want to quit drinking.
You won't for a minute consider that he might have a good reason for the criticism.
<p>
(FYI: I did quit drinking and smoking 3 1/2 years ago.)
</font><p>

The real issue is whether a person is an alcoholic and needs help.

<p><font color="blue">
No,
<font color="#ef0000">
<i>the real issue</i></font> is whether A.A. actually works to cure or treat alcoholism.<br>
You are trying to change the subject. That is the propaganda technique called

<p>
Well, A.A. doesn't work. A.A. is just a cult religion masquerading as a treatment

[Fri, June 18, 2004, 2nd letter from Angelle:]
<p>
Thank you kindly for the information. I am not an angry person; quite 
the opposite, but it is necessary to choose my battles and yours was 
one of them. A.A. is a support group to me but not the be all and end 
all. Alcoholism is only a symptom of other problems and so the 
studies cannot define alcoholics in black and white terms. It is one 
of the ways in which it saved me from a miserable existence. 
Alcoholics Anonymous has helped me stop drinking and live a life not 
just go through the motions. For me, it is important to know that I 
am a spiritual being striving for goodness. I abhor religion for 
myself but would never judge anyone else if that is the support they 
need.

<p><font color="blue">
Hi Angelle,
<p>
It is all fine and well that you enjoy the A.A. social club, but it is of course
a religion, and a rather crazy dogmatic cult religion at that.
See definitions of the word &quot;religion&quot;
<a href="orange-definitions.html#religion" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Remember Bill Wilson's ravings in the <i>Big Book</i> about how you
simply <font color="#BF0000"><i>MUST</i></font> believe in his version of God, or else:
<ul>
<li> &quot;it had to be a Power greater than ourselves&quot;
<li> &quot;an All Powerful, Guiding, Creative Intelligence&quot;
<li> &quot;a Power beyond ourselves&quot;
<li> &quot;a Supreme Being&quot;
<li> &quot;Creator&quot;
<li> &quot;our Maker&quot;
<li> &quot;Spirit of the Universe underlying the totality of things&quot;
<li> &quot;the Realm of Spirit is broad&quot;
<li> &quot;God is everything&quot;
<li> &quot;the Great Reality&quot;
<li> &quot;God was going to be our Director&quot;
<li> &quot;He is the Principal&quot;
<li> &quot;He is the Father&quot;
<li> &quot;We feel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe&quot;
<li> and then alcoholism is &quot;a spiritual disease&quot;,
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#sp_exp_conquer" target="_blank">which only a
spiritual experience will conquer</a>&quot;
<li> &quot;... you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
And then Bill Wilson laid it on even thicker in his second book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
I must quickly assure you that A.A.'s tread innumerable paths in their quest for faith.
You can, if you wish, make A.A. itself your 'higher power.' Here's a very large group of
people who have solved their alcohol problem. In this respect they are certainly a power
greater than you, who have not even come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in
them. Even this minimum of faith will be enough. You will find many members who have crossed
the threshold just this way. All of them will tell you that, once across, their faith
broadened and deepened.
Relieved of the alcohol obsession, their lives unaccountably
transformed, they came to believe in a Higher Power, and most of them began to talk of
God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, pages 27-28.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Excuse me, but A.A. was supposed to be an &quot;acquire sobriety&quot;
program, not an &quot;acquire faith&quot; program.

<p>
That is a religion, no matter how much some members yammer the double-talk
about <i>&quot;It's spiritual, not religious.&quot;</i>
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">See the file on that</a>.
<p>
That is also
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">a bait-and-switch trick</a>,
where first the beginners are told that no beliefs are
required, but later belief in Wilsonism is declared to be essential for survival.

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested
<font color="#BF0000">[MY required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to
<font color="#BF0000">[MY]</font> spiritual principles
<font color="#BF0000">[cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,

</blockquote>
</font><p>



I don't believe for a minute that A.A. has helped people to 
their death;

<p><font color="blue">
Sorry, but it doesn't matter what you believe.
Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services Trustee, Professor, and Doctor, George E. Vaillant
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">proved that A.A. kills patients</a>.
You should read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve Step Treatment</a>
</font><p>


 the statistics show the perceived &quot;success&quot; rate which I 
believe cannot be measured so why can't it show the natural rate 
whereby people would have died anyhow?
<p><font color="blue">
Excuse me, but that is confused gibberish. What statistics? Whose statistics?
<p>
Of course success and failure can be measured. It isn't hard to tell whether patients
are sober, drunk, dead drunk, or simply dead.

<p>
There are some statistics that do show both the success rate and the failure rates.
The first that come to mind are
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the Harvard Medical School</a>,
which declared that
slightly over 50% of all alcoholics eventually quit drinking and save
their own lives, so the other almost 50% die of complications due to
alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction. That is clear and easy to understand.
And 80% of those winners who successfully quit did it alone, on their own, without
any &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.
That is also simple and easy to understand.
<p>
Another set of statistics that come to mind are those of
A.A.W.S. Trustee <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Prof. George Vaillant</a>.
Using an A.A. treatment program on his alcoholic patients for 8 years,
he got a 95% failure rate, and a 5% success rate. But 5% per year is just the
normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics, so the real A.A.
success rate, above and beyond normal spontaneous remission, was zero.

<p>
Then there are the statistics of Doctors
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Brandsma</a>,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Walsh</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditma" target="_blank">Ditma</a>,
all of whom found A.A. to be a failure, too.

</font><p>

 
 But that's enough of this. I 
am so glad you quit drinking, in any way you needed to. It's too bad 
you've spent your time and energy debunking A.A.
It doesn't matter as long as you're happy and have a quality of life.

<p><font color="blue">
Why is it too bad? Isn't debunking harmful cults a good thing to do?
Is it also unfortunate that
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">I debunk other cults like Scientology</a>,
the Moonies, Hari Krishnas,
and 
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">children's torture camps</a>?
</font><p>

Three fingers pointing back at you regarding anger.

<p><font color="blue">
Thanks for repeating yet another brain-damaged A.A. cult slogan.
(<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_thought_stop" target="_blank">There are so many</a>.)
<p>
You are also repeating Bill Wilson's insane nonsense about anger &#8212; that you can't
be angry:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about
&quot;justifiable&quot; anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't
we entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly angry with self-righteous
folk? For us in A.A. these are dangerous exceptions.
We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those
better qualified to handle it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 90.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well guess what? I am one of those people who is better qualified to handle anger.
I can do something useful with it, like use the energy to build a web site that tells the truth
about some nasty cults.

[Thu, June 24, 2004, 3rd letter from Angelle:]
<p>

Three fingers pointing back isn't from A.A. It's from codependent 
recovery.

<p><font color="blue">
Hi Angelle,
<p>
Sorry, but it is. It is a <i>very</i> old A.A. slogan, one that dates
all the way back to
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the Oxford Group cult roots of A.A.</a>, back in the
early nineteen-thirties. Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups had the slogan,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When I point my finger at my neighbor there are three fingers pointing
back at me.&quot;<br>
</font>
See:
G&ouml;sta Ekman, <i>Experiment with God</i>, page 26.
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson copied the slogan from the Oxford Groups, and then your codependent
recovery organization copied it from Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font><p>

I guess if you need to channel your anger, your website is 
a harmless way to do it. Me, I'd rather work on the anger and not 
have it and I'd rather experience life than just talk about it. There 
certainly is a need for anger. There is a lot of injustice in life 
but I'm living proof I don't need to drink over it.


<p><font color="blue">
I don't need to drink over it either, but I have chosen to do something besides
sit on my duff and do nothing while a dishonest cult misleads, misinforms, and harms people.
</font><p>

I've been 
involved with several &quot;programs&quot; dealing with sexual abuse, spousal 
abuse and none of them brainwashed me. I do not let anyone brainwash 
me.

<p><font color="blue">
So far, everything you have said here shows that you have been well indoctrinated
with the standard cult dogma. You show no signs of being able to think independently.
You just parrot one A.A. slogan after another, as if they were the answer to everything,
and then you use the standard cultish propaganda and debating techniques like
sarcasm,

<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i> attacks</a>
(kill the messenger) and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#divert" target="_blank">create a diversion</a> to avoid
discussing the real issues like the A.A. failure rate and death rate.
<p>
Have you even bothered to read
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">what Prof. George Vaillant,
A.A. Trustee, wrote</a>?
Mentally blanking out and refusing to even look at information that contradicts
the standard group dogma is another sign of having been brainwashed.

<p>
You really should do a <i>searching and fearless <b>mental</b> inventory</i>...
</font><p>



Still glad you're not taking that drink but I have to wonder 
about your quality of life but that's your business. I'm finished 
with this. It's tiresome. Hope after you're done debunking all your 
causes, you can put effort into your own recovery. If you put as much 
effort into yourself as you do your webpage, you'll do well, Mr. 
Orange.
<p>
Angelle


<p><font color="blue">
You have a good life, too, Angelle. I hope you recover some day.

&quot;are you a big drunk who's afraid to sober up&quot;
<p>
 
Since you are attacking AA.
DO you offer any advice or suggestions to help those who

<p>
 
Here are the facts about alcoholism.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709035631/http://www.ncadd.org/facts/numberoneprob.html" target="_blank">

<a name="Athens_Georgia"> </a>
<p><font color="blue">
Hi. There are no easy answers, and no magic bullets, unfortunately.
<p>
About your references, those are not &quot;the facts about alcoholism&quot;.
Be very wary of propaganda that comes from the NCADD. Remember that it is just
a front group for A.A.,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Marty_Mann" target="_blank">founded by Marty Mann</a>
for the purpose of promoting Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
When they demand &quot;parity&quot; and &quot;fair treatment&quot; for
alcoholics, that is just a veiled
demand for more money for A.A. counselors who want to force more people into the A.A.
cult. The vast majority of treatment centers in the USA are just A.A. recruiting centers.
Specifically, a National Treatment Center Study, done by Paul Roman and Terry Blum,
Institute for Behavioral Research, Athens, Georgia, 1997,
says that 93.1% of all treatment centers in the
USA utilize the 12-step approach.
So &quot;more money for treatment&quot; really means &quot;more money
for stepper recruiters and proselytizers&quot;, whose answer to alcoholism is
to send all of the patients to A.A. meetings.
<p>
But since treatment is ineffective, it's all just a waste of money.

<p>
Now I know that they keep on yelling that &quot;treatment works&quot;. They have to.
They would lose billions of dollars if they admitted that it was all ineffective
quack medicine.
<p>
The NCADD web page on &quot;The Number One Problem&quot;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709035631/http://www.ncadd.org/facts/numberoneprob.html" target="_blank">
http://www.ncadd.org/facts/numberoneprob.html</a><br>
ended by claiming that &quot;treatment works&quot;,
and then they listed some statistics that they were quoting from a couple of
&quot;studies&quot;. Out of the entire world of studies and reports, they
hand-picked just two studies that seemed to report positive results from treatment &#8212;
one from Ohio, and one from California.
How were those studies done? Were they valid tests,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#test1" target="_blank"><b><i>randomized tests with
control groups</i></b></a>
that could really show what the success rate was?
Probably not, almost invariably not. A.A. propagandists almost never cite
anything like a valid,
fair tests, because the few valid tests that have been done have shown that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">12-Step
treatment is completely ineffective and just a big waste of time and money</a>.
<p>
The footnotes on that NCADD web page cite:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohio Dept. of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services, New Standards, Inc., St.
Paul, MN, 1994.<br>
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gerstein, et al,
&quot;Evaluating Recovery Services: the California Drug and Alcohol
Assessment,&quot; Sacramento, 1994.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first one is ostensibly a report by the State of Ohio
 &quot;Dept. of Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services&quot;.
But it appears that the document was actually written by
 <i>&quot;New Standards, Inc., St. Paul, MN&quot;</i>. Now that is strange.
 Who are they? What do they know?
What do they have to do with Ohio and its treatment of addictions?
 Why are the authors located just down the road from The Hazelden Foundation, the world's
biggest A.A. propaganda agency in Center City, MN? (That is not idle conjecture.
There is another such A.A. promotion agency in St. Paul that appears to be another
front for Hazelden, or a Hazelden subcontractor. Remember that the
&quot;recovery industry&quot; is a multi-billion-dollar game.)

<p>
The publication of the second document is uncertain.
They don't say who published it (maybe the California state government).
 I'll see what I can do to track
them down and see what they really say, and whether they were anything like
valid tests of treatment programs. (Probably not, because valid tests get published
in peer-reviewed journals.)
<p>
Remember that when government agencies report on the success rate of their programs,
that they are passing judgement on themselves. So of course self-serving bias kicks
in and they find that their work is pretty darned good, with lots of great results
and success stories....
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE: 2010.05.21<br>
I was looking at this page again, and realized that I had never gotten
around to tracking down that article by Gerstein. I used a Google search
for it, and the results were interesting, to say the least.
It seems that those same two articles from 1994 are repeatedly cited by treatment centers
that are claiming that &quot;Treatment Works!&quot;, while providing no other evidence for that claim.
Look at these three hits:

== this one is especially good. It is Scientology selling their &quot;Narconon&quot; scam,
where they claim that the ravings of the paranoid schizophrenic Lafayette Ronald Hubbard
will cure drug and alcohol problems. Look carefully at the bottom of the page. See &quot;ARCONON&quot;
in the photograph? See the menu box next to it that sells &quot;Narconon&quot;. That is Scientology.<br>
So Scientology is using fudged studies that had nothing to do with Scientology to claim
that &quot;Narconon&quot; treatment works.
</ol>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p><br>

That still leaves the giant question of &quot;Well, what does work?&quot;
<p>
Tough as it is to hear, the first thing that works is spontaneous remission.
Just let them recover by themselves. They will do it when they feel like it,
and not until.
<p>
Rational approaches to recovery have shown small positive results.
Rational Behavior Therapy (RBT), and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)
(like the SMART meetings) have shown good results in some tests.
In
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma's test</a>, RBT scored better than no treatment while A.A. scored worse
than no treatment for reducing binge drinking in alcoholics.
<p>
Still, the bottom line is that there is no easy answer and no magic bullet,
and no treatment program that produces great results.
And funding 12-Step treatment is just funding voodoo medicine and quack medicine.
And it is government support for, funding of, and promotion of, a cult religion.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Keith,

First off, yes I am an alcoholic and the son of an alcoholic who drank himself to death.

<p>
You are parrotting standard A.A. dogma.
Alcoholism is not a disease &#8212; at least, not a disease like tuberculosis,
cancer, or diabetes.
You cannot stop dying from cancer just by abstaining from eating fats or white sugar or
something, but you can stop dying from alcoholism just by not drinking any
more alcohol. Obviously, alcoholism has more to do with behavior than anything
else. Cancer, tuberculosis, and diabetes do not.
<p>
Now there is a genetic component to alcoholism that lots of alcoholics have, including
my father and I. But that gene simply makes us unable to drink &quot;normally&quot;.
It does not force us to drink, and it does not make us powerless over alcohol.
Drinking is still a choice.
I simply choose not to drink alcohol any more, and, apparently, so do you.

<p>
There is no evidence that A.A. has saved countless lives.
The A.A. claims are gross exaggerations at best.
The fact that you see some sober people sitting in a room does not prove that
the room or the meeting made them get sober.
And it really wasn't the Twelve Steps poster hanging on the wall.
You might as well give the credit to the rug or chairs or the paint on the walls.
<p>
Bill Wilson's claims of great success in sobering up alcoholics
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">were lies</a> that he told
because he wanted to sell the Big Book and grow his cult so that he wouldn't
ever have to work again &#8212; which he didn't.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">
Bill stole all of the money and the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i></a> and
made A.A. support him for the rest of his life.

<p>
Those people who quit drinking are those who were going to quit anyway.
There is such a thing as spontaneous remission. People do &quot;just get over it&quot;.
Go read <a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the
Twelve Step Treatment</a>.

And yes, it is a cult, a cult in the truest sense of the word.

I don't think you know what an alcoholic is ! did you

the way your brain  handles social skils and causes
people to drink BECAUSE of this. did you know that you
are three parts, physical (your body), intellectual
(brains such as school work) and your soul ( what
makes you what you are). Did you know that AA helps you
with your soul and if you seek help with your soul God
will help you not to drink !!, did you know that an
alcoholic can NOT process out his or her problems by
them selfs.

Yes I do know about alcoholism. I know all about it, because I am an alcoholic

A.A. does not help anyone with their soul. (Not unless you consider

&#8212; But the early Christian church found that the practice of public
confessions in church services
created all kinds of horrible problems, including
<a href="orange-heresy.html#confessions" target="_blank">
corrupting the children, and people taking pride in their sins</a>,
so they banned the practice of public confessions.

<p>
And it is a great stretch to go from that one line that St. James wrote
to making a circus and a public spectacle out of confessions.
This is old hat &#8212; a 2000 year old mistake.
<p>
Notice that the Catholic Church has people confess to an ordained Priest in private,
in sworn confidence, in a confessional, not in public.
There are a number of good reasons why the Church has a ban on public confessions.
<p>
The Oxford Group cult, from which Bill Wilson derived the practices of A.A., had
the same problems. Frank Buchman just resurrected a very old mistake, and then
Bill Wilson copied it from Frank.

<p>
Good morning  &#8212;  I visited your web site for the first time today and spent
over 3 hours there. Finding you was like finding a sane voice in the midst
of the babble of nonsense. Will you tell me who you are and why you have
taken such an antithetical stance against the sacrosanct AA? What are your
credentials to challenge this &quot;pillar&quot; of group therapy?

<p>
I am nearly 3 years married to a man who boasts of 18 years of sobriety.
I've known him for nearly 9 years and knew he was a &quot;former&quot; alcoholic early
on. When we became a couple, he told me right up front that he went to
meetings twice a week without fail, and that his participation in AA was not
to be questioned by me. I've respected that and never complained when he
left for his Tuesday and Thursday night meetings, sometimes not having time
to eat dinner with me beforehand. I did not complain when I was very ill and
in cancer treatment, too weak to move from the couch or bed, and still he
never missed a meeting. I even accompanied him to an AA meeting when we were
in Florida over Christmas holidays in 2001 and bit my tongue about my
impressions of it.

<p>
In the course of adjusting to our marriage and each other, differences of
opinions and stubbornness on both our parts brought up some emotionally
unpleasant times, especially this past holiday season, once again in
Florida. After returning home, I decided I would accompany my husband on
Thursday evenings and attend Al-Anon meetings while he went to AA. He was
very pleased at my decision. I was curious to see what it was all about and
I wondered whether it would help me better understand alcoholism. Let me say
here that my father was an abusive alcoholic, as was his father. My oldest
younger brother (I had 4) died in 1999 at 51 after a lifetime of alcoholism.
He wanted to be just like dad, and he was. My first husband died at 52 of
diabetic complications exacerbated by his alcoholism. Then, I hooked up with
an abusive alcoholic boyfriend. (You'd think I'd run the other way.) After
him, I disappeared into a platonic marriage of too many years to a man who
didn't drink but was narcissistic and devoid of emotions. In 1992, my only
child, my 29-year old son, was killed by a drunk driver. So, you can see,
alcohol has been a prominent factor throughout my life. I chose not to
drink.

<p>
From the first Al-Anon meeting, I knew I did not belong there. I am above
average in intelligence, prefer the company of people with whom I can share
ideas and be understood, and I am not interested in group therapy. After my
son's death I attended Compassionate Friends only a few times until I
realized that there were people at those meetings whose child was 20-years'
dead and they still wanted to sit there crying and telling others about it.
Those meetings kept me from healing and getting back into life, albeit a
different life without my son. I would leave feeling as if scabs had been
ripped off the wounds of my heart.

<p>
Anyway, my impression of Al-Anon is that if those people were paying $100 an
hour for weekly counseling they would soon pronounce themselves cured of
what ails them. Instead, I hear them speak of Al-Anon as a &quot;life program&quot;
and how grateful they are for that. One woman brags that she has been coming
to meetings for 22 years! She has no life but to attend as many meetings as
are available in a 50-mile radius, and her husband is a psychologist! I've
never attended a class or seminar that didn't offer some sort of hope of
change and growth if not a cure, spiritual or physical. The first night at
Al-Anon, I was taken aback by their rote recitation of the Lord's Prayer. I
don't need a church or a new religion. I am a student of the Tao and there I
was adrift in a sea of Baptists. Every week I've heard the same &quot;poor me&quot;
stories from people who scarcely know the King's English. I recognize that
there is a benefit to opening oneself without fear of judgment or criticism
to other people who understand the insanity you are living with. But I do
not see any attempt at healing at Al-Anon. After all I've been through with
alcohol, I'd sooner get the hell out of a relationship than to ever put up
with a drinker's bad behavior again. Some at the meetings speak of their
tribulations with the tone of martyrdom. They say their lives are out of
control because of &quot;their alcoholic.&quot; They just don't let it rile them any
more.

<p>
More than one new person has come to an Al-Anon meeting but never returned.
One was a young woman with two babies and a frightening, desperate home
situation. The 22-year veteran brought her as a &quot;guest.&quot; The girl never
uttered a word. Instead of any helpful information on how to deal with her
active-alcoholic husband, she heard the group talking about US taking a
moral inventory of ourselves and making amends to those we have hurt, as if
WE need fixing to improve our marriages. She was clearly afraid for her
safety and that of her children. She needed to go to a shelter instead of
Al-Anon.

<p>
I don't want to make friends with any of the people I've met at the Al-Anon
meetings or coming out of the AA meetings. Outside that building we have
absolutely nothing in common. I love my husband more than I've loved anyone
I wasn't kin to, but I cannot attend another Al-Anon meeting nor can I say
anything supportive about his involvement in AA. I won't bitch about his
attending meetings, but I will no longer let it inconvenience me or subvert
my plans. He is good and intelligent and I am honestly proud of his strength
and conviction to overcome the obstacles of his life. He says AA saved his
life, and that he goes to meetings to be an inspiration to the new people.
When we were stressed out with each other, I found the words to convey to
him that it was not AA keeping him sober but the strength of his life
decision to be sober. He thought about that for a moment and said he liked
that.

<p>
I've not read everything on your web site but will keep going back to read
through more of the material. It is wonderful that you have the courage to
speak out against what is, in every sense of the word, a cult. Why are there
no expose' television programs about AA?

<p>
Thank you for being there for those of us who also think &quot;the emperor has no
clothes,&quot; when it comes to considering the validity of AA.

Hi Sherron,
<p>
Thanks for a great letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
<a name="biography"> </a>
As far as who I am, that is a tough question because I am many things.
<ul>
<li>
First off, I'm an old hippie from the sixties who has taken everything under the sun,
only to end up getting addicted to alcohol and tobacco &#8212; the straight people's drugs.
Go figure.
<p>
<li>
I'm also the son of an abusive alcoholic father, so I've been educated about alcoholism
all of my life.
<p>
<li>
I am also somebody who is &quot;in recovery&quot;,
as they call it,
working on rebuilding my health and growing
a few new brain cells. And I've been to a bunch of A.A. meetings in the process,
and that is what actually started this whole thing.

<p>
<li>
I'm also somebody who has spent years reading about and studying alcoholism,
as you can see from the <a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">bibliography</a>.

<p>
<li> I am also someone who has enough native intelligence to read doctors'
scientific reports and understand what they mean. I started off studying biology
in college, but ended up being a computer programmer.
<p>
<li>
The
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">introduction</a>,
this description of
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program" target="_blank">treatment</a>&quot;,
and the file &quot;<a href="orange-ratpark.html" target="_blank">Rat Park</a>&quot;
also give a bit more autobiographical information.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="old_peoples_drug"> </a>
You described how you came from a family with a history of alcoholism and then married
another alcoholic, and said,
<font color="black">
&quot;You'd think I'd run the other way.&quot;
</font>
Yes, that is the hell of it. I also came from an alcoholic family, and married a
girl who came from an alcoholic family. And I wasn't even drinking at that time.
She thought that I was a non-alcoholic. (Well, I was at that time.
Hippies weren't into those old people's drugs...)
Oh, and her previous husband had been an alcoholic too...
Years later, she cried to me that every man in her entire life had been an
alcoholic.
<p>
It's like birds of a feather. The sons and daughters of alcoholics are attracted
to each other because there are all kinds of subtle ques, clues, attitudes,
mannerisms, body language things,
that come from being part of an alcoholic's family,
that all say, &quot;He or she is one of us.&quot;
The prospective partner just feels familiar and comfortable, one of us, somehow,
in some indescribable way... even when he hasn't even started his drinking career yet.
<p>
I knew another girl who was the daughter of an alcoholic who never got
into relationships
with any men except alcoholics. She knew that she was just buying herself an endless
river of grief and troubles by doing that, but she couldn't seem to
help it because she felt that non-alcoholic men were just boring.

<p>
<a name="Stossel"> </a>
<br>
Why are there no honest TV programs about A.A.? That's a good question.
It seems like maybe it's a combination of laziness and cowardice.
The closest thing I've seen lately was John Stossel's
ABC News 20/20 TV program, <i>&quot;Help Me, I Can't Help Myself&quot;</i>,
April 21, 2003, which questioned the standard myths about addiction and
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<p>
The A.A. propaganda machine continues to
<a href="orange-letters13.html#ER" target="_blank">plant favorable references
to A.A. in TV programs like <i>ER</i></a>,
but nobody wants to stir up a hornet's nest by telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. can be just as punishing as Scientology when people criticize it.
That came up in a previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters14.html#unchallenged" target="_blank">here</a>

[Wed, June 23, 2004, 2nd letter from Sherron:]
<p>

Dear Orange  &#8212; 
<p>
Thank you for your candid response. I appreciate you and what you are
attempting to accomplish. AA is for the sheep of the world. We rams just keep
butting heads with the madness. I want no part of any group &#8212; religious or secular &#8212;
that tells me what to think, what to believe, or how to behave. The scary thing is,
so many others buy into letting someone else do all their thinking. &quot;It's a Life
Plan. Neato!&quot;
<p>

After my son's death, I spent a lot of time in grief counseling that included going
over other aspects of my life. My counselor helped me to understand that I had
sought out what had been &quot;modeled&quot; for me in my childhood &#8212; i.e., the dysfunction,
tension, and misery born of alcoholism and inflicted on the entire family. I was
drawn to men like my dad because it was &quot;familiar,&quot; I knew what to expect. Knowing
that, accepting that, and forgiving myself for my stupid mistakes, empowers me to
face life with less fear and more self-determination. At this stage, I'm not willing
to take anything abusive off of anybody. That is no way to live. If people can't
live together as friends and in harmony, what's the point!!? I'd rather live alone.
I am grateful for every day I have and I don't intend to waste another one. As much
as I love this dear man I am with, it would be a deal-breaker if he started drinking
again or became abusive in any way. My days of being a martyr or &quot;rescuer&quot; are long
over. 
<p>

At least I've learned my lessons. In an Al-Anon meeting, after talking about all the
hell she'd been through with her late husband and recent boyfriend, a women stated
matter-of-factly that she would not hesitate to get involved with yet another
alcoholic. She found them &quot;interesting, exciting.&quot; I found her masochistic and
pathetic.
<p>

Keep doing what you're doing. Don't let the turkeys get you down. Meanwhile, I'm
adding you to my short list of heroes &#8212; right up there with Depak and Wayne.
<p>

Warm regards to you,<br>
Sherron, in KY

Hi Sherron,

Hello AO,

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is a thread on a nursing forum that I thought you might find 
interesting.  The topic is 12-step coercion.  The thread was started by Tommy 
Perkins (owner of 12-step Coercion Watch) after he gave a presentation to the 
North Caroline Board of Nursing regarding the unconstitutional practice of 
mandating nurses to participate in 12-step programs.  As you might expect, the 
steppers and AA apologists have come out of the virtual woodwork to defend their 
sacred program and propagate the lies and fallacies that are the foundation of 
AA.  You don't need to be a member to read the posts, but you must register to 
reply to any post.  You do not have to be a nurse to register.  I would love to

I am a member of the Unitarian  Universalist Association. There have been
articles favorable to AA in our monthly magazine. Let me explain that  the UU
(our denomination) is extremely liberal with very little in the way of church
dogma. This makes it very easy for AA to &quot;worm its way in&quot;.There is now an
addictionology counselor who doubles as a UU minister in Newton, MA. From here
he is launching an &quot;Addictions Ministry&quot;. The irony is that the UU is supposed
to be a religion for sophisticated, formally educated, liberally minded
individuals. The subtle sophistry of AA is scary. It can literally appeal to
desperate intellectuals just as easily as it can to those with shallow minds. It
berates one group of people for their intelligence (which couldn't solve their
drinking problem) while it rewards others for being anti-intellectual. In the
end I am offended by a minister in my own denomination who spreads the message
that recovery is not about taking the moral resposibility to resist temptation.
I quit drinking 8 years ago. I've been to AA, and it was worthless. I just quit
on my own. So can anyone.

Hello Kari,

So you didn't bother to actually read what I wrote, but you just have to criticize it
anyway?
That shows your level of involvement with facts and the truth....
</font><p>

If you
would do a little more research into the subject...for example, how many thousands
of lives that blue book has saved, you might realize the impact that it has.

<p><font color="blue">
I have done <i>a lot</i> of research.
You should read

Just read the entire list of books,
not all of the books listed there, like I have. That's how much research I've done.
How many books on the subject have you read? Let's see your list.
<p>
Notice that the <i>Big Book</i> is the first book on the list, closely followed by Bill
Wilson's other delusional ravings like <i>12x12</i>
and <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>.
</font><p>

Yet insted you decide to pick and tear at every small detail that might be askew.

<p><font color="blue">
I insist on telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
</font><p>

You have no idea how it REALLY works.
<p><font color="blue">
I have a very good idea of how it doesn't work. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank"><i>The Cult Test</i></a>
and the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
<i>The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</i></a>.
<p>
Also read the information about the A.A. failure rate
that comes straight from the A.A. headquarters.
The GSO published a summary of the triennial surveys that showed that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">A.A. had
a 95% dropout rate in the first year</a>. That only leaves 5 percent who
could possibly be success stories. But 5% per year is the normal rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholics. That's the people who get sick and
tired of being sick and tired, and just quit drinking and save their own lives,
usually alone, without any so-called &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.
Well 5 minus 5 leaves 0.  Zero is the real A.A. success rate.
A.A. does not increase the amount of sobriety
in the world above and beyond those people who were going to quit anyway.
A.A. just takes the credit for people quitting and saving
their own lives.
<p>
Also read the work of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who is a member of the
Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services.
He shoved A.A. treatment on his alcoholic patients for many years.
After an 8-year-long test of A.A. treatment, he reported that A.A. did nothing
except raise the death rate in alcoholics.
It didn't help the alcoholics to get and stay sober.
The A.A. treatment program had the highest death
rate of any treatment program that Vaillant studied.
<p>
And that information comes straight from a leader of A.A.. (Nevertheless, Vaillant
is such an intense religious nut that he wants to shove all alcoholics into
A.A. anyway, even though he admits that it doesn't work,
to &quot;get an attitude change&quot; by &quot;confessing their sins to a high-status
healer&quot;.)

<p>
Just because you can gather a bunch of sober people in a room does not prove
that the room or the meeting made them get sober.
</font><p>

The level of spirituality is up to the individual,
the big book gives us the oppurtunity to stay sober long enough to see that.

<p><font color="blue">
The talk about &quot;the level of spirituality&quot; is absurd.
You should read the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank"><i>The Heresy of the 12 Steps</i></a>.

The <i>Big Book</i> is a hodge-podge of

<a href="orange-recruit.html#stress_spiritual" target="_blank">deceptions</a>,
and <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">lies</a>.
It offers an opportunity to become confused and misinformed, nothing more.
</font><p>

And
slowly but surely every one of those promises that are mentioned are coming true in
my life.
<p><font color="blue">
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#promises" target="_blank"><i>The Promises</i></a>, huh?
So now
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle" target="_blank">God is your servant</a>
and is doing for you what you &quot;can't&quot; (won't) do for yourself?
How did you get God to be your slave and grant your wishes?
<p>
There is nothing in the Bible says that God will be your servant just because
you practice
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the cult religion of Frank Buchman</a>,
which is what A.A. theology really is. (Bill Wilson just stole it all from the
Oxford Groups.)
<p>
And there is nothing in the Koran, the Talmud, the Bhagavad-Gita, or Buddhist texts
that says that God will be your wish-granting servant, delivering miracles on demand, either.

</font><p>

So continue on with your crusade, but you are missing the point. Try going
to a meeting and being open-minded... because to me it sounds like you are the
typical hypocite. You say you're open minded, but the truth is you are only open to
your own mind.

No, I am not missing the point. You are. The point is supposed to be to save people

But there is no evidence

is because they get sick and tired of being sick and tired, and don't want to suffer
like that any more.
<p>
And if you think practicing A.A. is practicing Christianity, then you should read the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank"><i>The Heresy of the 12 Steps</i></a>.
<p>
I know it was just a misspelling, but it's almost a Freudian slip:
You said, <i>&quot;I prey that one day you
discover it and are released from it.&quot;</i>

Preying is what predators do. Preying on innocent and confused people is what cults do.
Preying on sick people is what A.A. does.
And that is why I criticize it.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

[June 30, 2004, 2nd letter from Bill H.:]
<p>

When we think we are in control of our own lives we are living in denial.

<p><font color="blue">
That is just another dumb A.A. slogan. That is completely untrue.
Like so many cults, A.A. likes to teach its members that they are weak and powerless,
their minds are defective, and they can't make it without the cult.
<p>
See:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">Cult Test item 43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">Cult Test item 67. Don't Trust Your Own Mind.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_cant_without" target="_blank">Cult Test item 84. You can't make it without the cult.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong" target="_blank">Cult Test item 2. You are always wrong.</a>
</ul>
</font><p>

We're all just one heartbeat away from being totally disabled or dead.

<p><font color="blue">
So what? Welcome to life. As Jim Morrison said, &quot;Nobody gets out of here alive.&quot;
</font><p>

Do you have the power
to prevent your own untimely death?  What if a random terroist attack was aimed
right at you?

<p><font color="blue">
That is just some lame fear-mongering. See
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">Cult Test item 34: The Cult Implants Phobias</a>.
Fear of death will not make me join Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font><p>
<a name="bow"> </a>
AA just tries to put alcoholics in touch with the great mystery of
life, that is why many became alcoholics... because this world just didn't offer
enough without God in it.    When we come to the end of ourselves &quot;ego&quot; we will all
realize this.  &quot;Every knee will eventually bow&quot;.  However, it is better to gladly
realize this now, and get on with the plan that God has for our lives.

<p><font color="blue">
Okay, now you have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Alcoholics Anonymous is a cult religion,
not a treatment program for alcoholism.
<p>
You have the right to belong to any religion you wish, but you do not have the legal
or Constitutional right to shove that religion on sick people while telling them that
it is a cure for alcoholism (or a cure for
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">any of a zillion other &quot;spiritual diseases&quot;</a>, either).
<p>
Also see:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_dual_purposes" target="_blank">Cult Test item 23: Dual Purposes, Hidden Agendas, and Ulterior Motives.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_total_faith" target="_blank">Cult Test item 50: Demands for Total Faith and Total Trust</a>
</ul>
<p>
Lastly, you are mistaken about the causes of alcoholism. There are many different causes,
ranging from child abuse to genetic defects to mental illnesses.  You are trying to declare
that alcoholism is just a religious problem, that people become alcoholics because they don't
have the right relationship with God. That is again just Bill Wilson's ravings about God
and religion.

<p>
Have a good day anyway.

Secret Agent Orange,
<p>
I greatly appreciate your writings.  I am an alcoholic and addict, who first got 
sober over 20 years ago.  I have had a problem with relapse, and AA has never 
worked for me, and I have never believed in it. Although my relapses have been 
short, lasting anywhere from 1 day to 3 or 4 weeks, they are always tragic.  I 
have lived MOST of the past 20 years sober.  You got any suggestions for someone 
who relapses every 2 to 5 years?  Any writings on this?  Any suggestions?
<p>
Suzanne H.

<p><font color="blue">
Hi Suzanne,
<p>
Brother do I have something to say on the subject. The same thing happened to me.
<p>
Well, let me rephrase that. I only relapsed once in my life, but it was a doozy,
after a long period of sobriety.
<p>
I quit drinking about 15 years ago, and stayed quit for 3 years, and then relapsed
and drank for another 9 years, until I really got messed up.
(So now I have 3 years of sobriety again, and I'm determined to not make
the same mistake again.)
I've spent a lot of
time thinking about that, and what happened, and how it happened, and how to keep
it from happening again.
<p>
When you say that you relapse at the 2 to 5 year point, I immediately
think of the brain-damaged logic (lizard-brain thinking) that fooled me:
<ul>
<li> &quot;It's been so long since I've had one; I have it under control now.&quot;
<li> &quot;Three whole years of not drinking, and no cheating whatsoever, I've got
a handle on it now. I can drink one beer and it will be okay.&quot;
<li> &quot;Oh heck, you're strong, you're smart, you aren't really an alcoholic.
Not like those poor fools who are always crawling the wall for a drink and have
to call their sponsors all of the time... Not like those alcoholics who keep
relapsing all of the time...&quot;
</ul>

<p>
One of the things that tripped me up was the belief that because the second
and third years of sobriety were so easy, that I was not really an alcoholic.
Indeed, according to the A.A. stereotypes, sobriety isn't supposed to be easy
for an alcoholic. You are supposed to be white-knuckling it all of the time
and always craving a drink.
In fact, you are supposed to be so hopeless and so powerless over alcohol
that only Higher Power can save you.
<p>
Well that stereotype is totally wrong.
It is grossly unrealistic. It
is just another one of Bill Wilson's stupid ideas that
declare that you are weak and only joining his cult will save you from
an alcoholic death.
<p>

My doctor explained it much better: He said that alcoholics have great
control over their sobriety; they can stay sober for years at a time.
They just don't have any control over their drinking. Their drinking
will spin out of control very rapidly.

<p>
I find that I am also very vulnerable to nostalgia. It wasn't so much a factor in the
alcoholic relapse, but it fooled me for the better part of 20 years when it came
to relapsing back to smoking cigarettes:
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Oh for the good old days, when we could just kick back and relax
and have one...&quot;
<li> &quot;Let's just have one for old times' sake...&quot;
<li> &quot;Oh yes, the good old days, back when we could do anything we wanted to...&quot;
<li> &quot;Wouldn't it be nice to just have one and relax like we used to?&quot;
<li> &quot;Remember what it was like to smoke in the beginning, how good it
tasted and how you weren't addicted? Well, after all this time not smoking,
it will be like that, if we just have a few...&quot;
</ul>

<p>
But what is going on there? Especially, who is <i>&quot;WE&quot;</i>?
(As if you have fleas or something?)
That little voice in your head keeps saying &quot;we&quot;:
<ul>
<li>
&quot;We should have one.&quot;
<li>
&quot;We should just sneak out and smoke a quick one.&quot;
<li>
&quot;We can have just one; one will be okay. That won't hurt anything.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
Well, &quot;we&quot; is old base brain and the higher centers of the brain.
That is, old lizard brain and you.
We have a node in the base of our brains, right at the top end of the
spinal cord, that is basically just a hungry horny little animal that
hasn't changed much since the days of the dinosaurs.
It is totally relentless when it comes to
<i>&quot;survive and reproduce, no matter what.&quot;</i>
The funny way that evolution sometimes works is that once Mother Nature
gets a good, working design for something, she just keeps it, and then
adds new stuff around it later. Well, our brains are like that.
The higher brain centers are just piled on top of old base brain.
The higher brain centers are
very intelligent and able to think rationally
and logically, but old base brain is still the same old dumb horny lizard
as lived 60 million years ago.
<p>
But the base brain isn't a bad thing &#8212;
The base brain handles lots of critical functions like keeping us
breathing at night while we sleep, regulating our heartbeats, and it also drives us
to survive &#8212; <i>&quot;Eat, feel good, have sex&quot;</i>.
We can't live without base brain.
<p>
Base brain isn't bad, it is just stupid. It cannot understand things like,
&quot;You shouldn't drink a bunch of beer and feel good now because you
will get readdicted and end up drinking far too much and
you will feel terrible in the long run.
It will wreck your health and mess up your life.&quot;
Base brain does not understand &quot;tomorrow&quot; at all.
For him, everything is right now &#8212;
<i>&quot;food now, sex now, feel good now&quot;</i>.
Base brain is the original &quot;instant gratification&quot; animal.

<p>
The really nasty kicker is that base brain learns very fast when it comes
to learning that alcohol, tobacco, and drugs can act as painkillers and can make
you feel better, sometimes even ecstatic. Base brain is all for that,
and he is too stupid to understand that getting quicky feel-goods by short-circuiting
the system with brain-altering chemicals usually has some very nasty side effects
in the long run.
So we can end up in a situation where the upper brain is logical and
rational, and making sane, sensible choices, while the lower brain is
complaining, &quot;Screw that noise. Grab the goodies. Feel great right now.&quot;
And old lizard brain is really great at screaming. It has an endless
supply of lines, like the ones above, that it will try out on you,
to get you to do what it wants whenever you decide to do something else.
<p>
I wrote a whole web page on this,
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
Check it out for the rest of my rap on old base brain. Enjoy.
<p>
One last note on the lizard brain thing &#8212; I find it extremely helpful
to understand that the lying, scheming, thirsty little animal brain
is not me. It's a part of my body, but it isn't really me.
Old lizard brain is just doing his thing, always scheming to get me to
smoke or drink, as well as to eat, have sex, and feel good by taking care
of myself. (So it's both bad and good...)
Recognizing that allows you to detach and not feel guilty about what is
going on. Sometimes I laugh when I see what he is doing, and how he is
thinking.
<p>
It's like a couple of summers ago, I went to a blues festival.
It was a hot sunny summer day, and in the middle of it an attractive
tall slinky young woman with a big foaming cold beer in a mug walked by,
and old lizard brain immediately said, <i>&quot;Both. I'll take both.&quot;</i>
(Yeh, grab the girl, drink up all of her beer and screw her. Sounds like
a plan to me.) I just said, &quot;No, we aren't doing that one today.&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject: Miller Newton/Straight, Inc.

<p>
Hi,

<p>
<a href="orange-letters13.html#Straight" target="_blank">I wrote you a few months ago</a>
regarding my experiences in Straight, Inc.   I was so glad to see that you posted it.
The tragedy of the Teen &quot;Help&quot; Industry needs the
light to be thrown on it and if Miller Newton and Mel Sembler get what they really
deserve it will be a perfect world.

<p>
You said that I piqued your interest.  I'm glad.  I hope you still interested.
There is a new website being set up by a someone that I was in that hellhole with.
It's one of the easiest sites to follow about Straight.  It's still under
construction, so please bear with her.
<p>

<p>
The name is
derived from the fact that Straight condensed the 12 Steps of AA into 7 new and
improved steps.

<p>
It amazes me that this is still going on.  I had no idea how widespread it was until
I entered Straight into a search engine a few years ago.  It's branched out into so
many different areas that I really can't believe it sometimes.  There's  boarding
school/treatment center/behavior modification school for anything and everything.
Whatever a parent doesn't like about their teen, they can fix it.  By force if
necessary.  Read this.

<p>
The money that these people make off of the suffering of God knows how many kids is
truly disgusting.  And there are no words and there is no forgiveness for Miller and
Mel  and the rest connected with that place and how they continue to boast about
their &quot;successes&quot; in the War On Drugs.  The people that run these places and
perpetuate this insanity need to be stopped.  Quite a few of us who have been
through these places call ourselves Drug War P.O.W.s.  I think it's appropriate.  I
was one for two years of my teenage life.

<p>
Keep up the good work!  If you decide to publish this, again, please do not use my
name or email address.

Hi. Yes, you piqued my interest, so I got a book by Newton Miller on how to &quot;help&quot;
children with his style of counseling. It was rather chilling.
I added a section about it to the web page
on children's gulags,
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Miller_Newton_book" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Enjoy, and have a good day, and you keep up the good work too.
