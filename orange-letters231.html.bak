I think I saw your picture somewhere in either one your letters or in your

 It looks like you were born in the same
era I was; the rejected baby boomers.  My &quot;friends &amp; neighbors&quot; selected me
in 1969.  You don't look like you'd be a good dancer, but based on your
responses you obviously are.  Your response to one of my statements was:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

You say that you didn't refer people to other programs that work better than
A.A. because you didn't know that they existed. Well now you know. So what
are you doing now?
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
I never did say other programs work better than AA.  What I said was.

<p>
In it you asked me why I didn't refer others to what I assume you feel are
more effective methods in addressing substance abuse.

<p>
Knowing other programs exist does not qualify me to make any comments, pro
or con, about them.  Not exactly a direct response was it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Nope. That's kind of dodging the question.
</font>
<p>
I did ask you several questions however; why you think the court system, the
treatment centers referred by corporate EAP programs direct people to AA.
When you think about it that's a lot of people in positions of power.  Why
do you think they are all so blind?

<p>
<font color="blue">
There are several factors:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First off, there are the hidden persuaders and proselytizers for the 12-Step religion,
doing their &quot;12th-Step work&quot;.
They routinely get themselves credentials as &quot;recovery experts&quot; or &quot;certified
addiction counselors&quot;, and then go around
insisting that everybody must get shoved into A.A. meetings.
And they have been doing that for 70 years now.
<p>
Being a 12-Step counselor is one of the more popular occupations for burned-out alcoholics and
drug addicts.

<p><li> Then there are the treatment centers that make a fortune from selling 12-Step
cult religion as a cure for alcoholism and drug addiction. They get anything from $7000 to
$40,000 per person (in advance, of course) for 28 days of indoctrination.
They are not about to blow the whistle on themselves and admit the truth.

<p><li> Then there are missionaries who just love the 12-Step religion even though
they are not alcoholics. Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant comes to mind. He has spent 40
years promoting A.A., even though he admits that it doesn't work to make alcoholics
quit drinking.
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Vaillant2" target="_blank">
He brags about the &quot;social rehabilitation&quot; of individuals</a>
through A.A., and claims that the goal is to 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#high_status_healer1" target="_blank">get the
alcoholics an &quot;attitude change&quot; through &quot;confession of sins
to a high-status healer&quot;</a>.
That is of course crazy.

<p>
<li> Which leads to the other people in power who don't really know what is going on,
and who are fooled by the proselytizers. They get told by the &quot;experts&quot; that A.A. works
great, and is the best thing, and they never hear anything different.
So they go along with it.

<p>
<li> And then there is just institutional inertia. Institutions keep on doing it this
way because they've been doing it this way for 30 or 40 years.
<p>
<li> Then there is cheapness. A.A. doesn't cost anything, so it is the lowest bidder.

</ol>
<p>
But the times they are a'changin. The current attitude of the NIH is to demand
results. They are demanding more and more evidence-based methods.
A high-ranking official of the NIAAA &#8212; Mark Willenbring, director of treatment and
recovery research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism &#8212; recently
declared that Alcoholics Anonymous teachings about alcoholism
were &quot;inconsistent with the evidence&quot;.
(<a href="orange-letters151.html#bozo" target="newwin84">Look here</a>.)

</font>
<p>
You did take me to a couple of places in an effort to prove Alcoholics
Anonymous adversely affects the divorce rate and promotes suicide.  In my
observations a big portion of suicides are brought about because the people
are suffering from some form of depression.  And alcohol is a catalyst for
depression.  Whether they are or have been AA members is NOT what causes the
suicides, it's the &quot;ism&quot; or the effects brought on by alcohol consumption &#8212; 
more depression &#8212; which leads people to taking their own lives.  There are
even times people commit suicide when alcohol wasn't even involved!  Why
don't you say being employed in law enforcement promotes suicide?  There are
statistics to support it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I said that the statistics on suicide were not scientific and had not been established
in randomized longitudinal controlled studies. There is however a preponderance of evidence.
<p>
And yes, people do commit suicide because of depression. And chronic depressives (like
William Griffith Wilson) do often drink to excess. So what do A.A. sponsors do?
Tell those people not to take their medications. That has unfortunately occasionally led to suicide.
<p>
The same thing goes for people with Bipolar Disorder or PTSD or Borderline Personality
Disorder or child abuse issues or rape issues or any of the rest of the psychiatric
problems.

</font>
<p>
<a name="divorce"> </a>
I do believe all marriages are affected by AA; many improve and others end
in divorce.  Quite a few &quot;drinking buddies&quot; get married and when one quits
drinking the marriage isn't fun anymore.  It's up to each couple to decide
what they want in their marriage, what they can live with and what kind of
changes they are willing to make in order to sustain it.  Once again this is
not a direct affect brought on by AA; it's brought about because only one of
the partners is willing to change.  The recovering alcoholic knows he must
change.  I'd be willing to bet that each of those other programs you
referred to in you previous note promote change, but there's probably no
statistics implicating their impact on marriages is there?

<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank"><i>Psychology Today</i> magazine reported
that A.A. has a 25% divorce rate in the first year</a>. That is sky-high.
<p>
It isn't just a matter of &quot;somebody needs to change&quot;.
It is also a matter of,
<font color="#4f007f"> 
&quot;She isn't one of us. She won't go to Al-Anon and get with the program.
She is dangerous to your sobriety. Dump her and get an A.A. girlfriend.&quot;
</font>
</font>
<p>
I believe Alcoholics Anonymous is not for everyone and statistics going back
more than 75 years will support it.  Their success rate is less than 10% if
your yardstick requires everyone who, once he enters AA never drinks again.
Have you got any statistics relating to your other programs?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Saying that A.A. isn't for everyone is a bit of a dodge, isn't it? For whom is
A.A. appropriate when it just raises the rates of binge drinking, rearrests, and death?
Not to mention cult religion irrationality and cliqueishness and devaluing the
outsider and divorcing the wife...

<p>
The other modalities are not &quot;my other programs&quot;. I got sober,
and stay sober, with no program.
<p>
Unfortunately, there just have not been nearly enough good randomized longitudinal controlled
studies of the various possible treatment programs.
Nevertheless,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">the one test I know of</a>
where A.A. was directly compared to both no treatment
and Rational Behavioral Therapy (similar to SMART), found that A.A. produced five times
the amount of binge drinking as no treatment, and nine times as much binge drinking
as the RBT group.

</font>
<p>
Keep going with your papers.  I really enjoy them, especially the AA history
you've been able to gather.  I don't agree with all of it, but I don't think
I've found anything considered non-fiction where I've been able to swallow
all of it; not even the Big Book.  I've even found some stuff in there in
which I was unable to find where you have addressed it.  (Hint; chapter one)
<p>
<font color="blue">
If you are saying that I have a misquote, then I want to know about it.
What are you talking about? Please be specific.
</font>
<p>

<p>
We folks in Illinois are looking forward to the upcoming change in the
weather, but it won't be long before we're complaining about it again.

<p>
Thanks again for all the work you've done,

<p>
Hi orange, these were some of my thoughts when i read
<a href="orange-letters229.html#sober_by_choice" target="_blank">&quot;sober by choice's&quot; letter</a>:

<p>
It's all about the money, billion$ are coming in and business has to grow, treatment
center and law enforcemet organizations need to keep the wheels turning. AA is just
a front for the addiction recovery industry and you (and others) have shown us how
dangerous it is. Maybe, time has come to take the next step and unveil the scam?

<p>
Thanks and have a good day too.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Diego,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm sure that some of the characters at the top are only
in it for the money. When some guy takes home nearly half a million dollars a 
year for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot; to A.A., something is very fishy.
<p>
And many treatment centers are just organized crime units that are certainly only in
it for the money. According to the New York Times, &quot;treatment&quot;
of alcohol abuse and drug addictions is a $20 billion
dollar per year industry in the USA. That's where the real money is.
And 
<a href="orange-letters217.html#NTCS" target="_blank">75% of the treatment centers
in the USA sell 12-Step quackery</a>
as their &quot;treatment&quot;.
That's a lot of money for dispensing some old cult religion.

<p>
But A.A. is really a multidimensional thing, like a pyramid with lots of levels,
and a third dimension too.
There are many other people who don't get any money. They have other desires and rewards.

<p>
<ul>
<li> At the bottom of the pyramid there are true believers who just love the cult religion
and make it their lives. They don't get any money; in fact, they pay &#8212; for books and
tapes and conventions and literature to give away, and regular donations to the basket.

<p><li> There are some deluded people who actually imagine that A.A. works great, and
they get a kick out of going around and &quot;saving lives&quot;.

<p><li>
And then there are the people who are afraid of dying. They fear that if they leave A.A.,
they will relapse and die drunk in a gutter. They aren't in it for the money.

<p><li> Then there are the people whose desires and motivation are things like power or
sex. They enjoy sponsoring newcomers and getting something from them &#8212; ego gratification,
status, sex, or cheap labor, or something. Money isn't their main motivation.

<p><li>
Way up the pyramid are various con artists who manage their own sub-cults and get some money
out of it. I hear that Mike Quinones of the Washington DC Midtown Group, and his grand-sponsor
Clancy Imusland in California, are doing quite well for themselves.
But still, money isn't their only motivation. I hear that they also get plenty of power,
status, fame, and sex, and they get (or got) to pass themselves off as real experts on recovery.
(Mike is dead now, so he isn't getting anything.)

</ul>
<p>
We talked about what people get out of A.A., and why the cult endures,
a few times in the past, and got some more lists of motives there:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters3.html#why_cult" target="newwin31">here</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters40.html#LauriJean" target="newwin32">here</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters107.html#why_cult" target="newwin30"> here</a>
</ul>
<p>
About unveiling the scam and revealing the truth, I've been doing that for 10 years
now, and by and large, the general public just doesn't want to hear about it.
They have their own problems, and their own fish to fry. But the word is getting
out slowly, little by little.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Orange!
<p>
<a href="orange-letters227.html#cut_off" target="_blank">Mike's recent letter</a>
to you caught my eye....

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I am still struggling to deprogram myself and would love some tips. The
fear that is planted that I will die if I leave AA or drink again is very
strong. Also should I cut off all ties with even people I liked?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
All I can tell Mike is that the fear of &quot;Jails, Institutions and Death&quot;
etc, implanted in our minds by sponsors, meetings and the blue book, takes
some time to purge, and in my case professional help to overcome. I realize
now that these thoughts are placed in our minds quite deliberately in order
to keep us trapped. Nothing compares to the professional help a good
therapist and psychiatrist can provide. It is probably why, in my close circle
of Clancy inspired AA nuts, &quot;therapy&quot; and &quot;medication&quot; were frowned upon.
In fact, there are still some moments when I find myself running those
dreadful scenarios through my mind. But, it does get better, much better in
fact, it just takes time and effort. Remember Mike, you didn't become an AA
zombie over night, it took you years to get that way!

<p>
Also, as far as cutting ties with old AA friends? Don't worry Mike, they
will cut the ties as cleanly as a surgeon's scalpel for you. They bugged me
for awhile, you know trying to get me to come back, but after about a year
they stopped. It's pretty funny actually, immediately after I left AA I was
the one who would run and hide if I spotted one at the grocery store or the
park..... now THEY are the ones who run in the opposite direction when they
see me. In fact just last Saturday, I was walking through a Florida
airport with my family as we were headed home from a spring break getaway......
Anyway, I glanced up and just happened to spot my old hag of an AA nazi
sponsor. She was dragging herself, and her very large suit case (probably filled
with AA literature) right towards me! In fact, I thought she might be on
our flight because we were both obviously headed home. She was alone, maybe
on business, who knows, who cares! Strangely enough, after I spotted her
she looked up from her phone and stared directly at me. Then, (and this is
when it gets funny) she darn near tripped over herself in her attempt to
get out of my path. The poor woman ended up doing a complete about face and
walked in the other direction! Oh my goodness it was a sight to see. The
look of complete terror/horror on her face was priceless! I just laughed out
loud, it was pretty funny..... I wonder how long it took her to get to her
gate? Do you think she ran and hid in the ladies room? She's lucky we were
not on the same flight back home, it would have been torture for the poor
thing to avoid me on a 737!!!

<p>
The active AA'ers do their level best to avoid those of us who have
successfully left their evil clutches. We really scare them, and threaten their
way of life, as well as everything they believe in their small little AA
world..... We can stay sober AND happy without the time eating, mind bending
and yes, dangerous AA BS... Oh! and Mike, it is a hoot when they pretend not
to know who the heck you are! I'll save that story for another day.

<p>
take care....and good luck to you Mike!<br>

night I was lead to your site and stayed up till 4 reading. Most of it brought my
gut feelings to light since you wrote everything out so clearly. So I just want to
say thanks, and I enjoy my 6 months of sobriety next week. I love sobriety and my
life now. And looking back I don't see how going to meetings and reading literature
ever once made me sober. I feel like the only things that helped me were the support
of friends and family and changing my routines and thinking. Never once does AA seem
to have done much except guilt tripped me into attending meetings so that I can hear
the same stories over and over from other alcoholics.
<p>
Anyways it's just a nice
weight off my shoulder knowing I can enjoy sobriety for
the sake of sobriety and being happy without the 500 pound monkey on my back that
is AA. Oh and keep me anonymous please ;-)

Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the positive letter and congratulations on your sobriety. That really
brightens my morning. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and free too.

<p>
The thing about cutting off your hair and beard is kind of personal, too. I don't
know if you saw one of my pictures, but here is one:

</center>
<p>
Well, I look like that, and I never cut my hair or shaved my beard, and it didn't
hurt my sobriety at all. I now have 10 years off of alcohol, tobacco, and any other
drugs (except great kick-ass Espresso coffee), and I still have all of my hair and beard too.
<p>
It reminds me of another fellow who loved to play music, and his sponsor told him
that he had to give up music and get rid of his guitars, to become clean and sober.
(By the way, I have half a dozen guitars, too.)

<p>
It never ceases to amaze me how some pompous fools can prop themselves up and claim
to be experts on addiction, and give out such bogus advice and bad guidance.
<p>
And this is nothing new. Back in the nineteen-sixties,
<a href="orange-ahcain.html" target="newwin8716">Dr. Arthur H. Cain wrote</a>
about the problem of A.A. pundits giving out bad advice on many subjects:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Many people I have tried to
help,&quot; said one Chicago member, &quot;have abandoned the program
just because they couldn't take the <i>ex cathedra</i> homilies
on drugs, alcohol, psychiatry, medicine, sociology, biology, to
name a few subjects on which they speak with authority.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The old saying about the blind leading the blind comes to mind. But it's worse than
that. It's the blind leading the sighted, and insisting that the sighted cannot see
straight. It's like the H. G. Wells story about &quot;The Country of the Blind&quot;.
They did not consider the one-eyed man king in the land of the blind.
They considered a man with eyes to be
deformed, and they wanted to do some surgery on his head and get rid of
those two round lumps to &quot;fix&quot; him and make him stop talking
insane nonsense about &quot;seeing&quot;.

<p>
Yuk. No thanks.
<p>
So welcome to freedom, and have a good day and a good life now.

I wanted to also add something that came to me today while hanging around the house.
My sponsor had given me an old lecture from the 70's on a CD that he said was his
sponsor. I for some reason just listened to the entire thing today and yesterday. He
then gave me another CD that I had listened to that he said he was affiliated with
his sponsor in California. I looked at the CD and it had written on it Pacific Group
09. I then did a little searching on your site and saw that they were connected to a
man named Clancy who I had seen come up a few times. And then it hit me that Clancy
was my sponsor's sponsor and has been for a number of years!

<p>
Mind you we live in Maine which is pretty damn far, and he had gone to visit him
recently in LA and I think Montana for some sort of get together. But I couldn't
believe that my &quot;grand sponsor&quot; was this nut bag that
I had read about on your website. This is the man who I sponsor went to for
guidance and passed it along to me and others. I read about how he did not allow
beards on men and that's why I was to cut mine off just like my sponsor had years
ago to &quot;enhance his sobriety&quot;. Thank you for helping me get away from these control
freaks.

Hello again, Anonymous,
<p>
Okay, that makes sense. That connects up a few more dots. Just a little while ago,
I got another letter from a woman who was getting bossed around by Clancy's Clones
(<a href="orange-letters219.html#Clancy" target="_blank">here</a>),
and she had to go to Montana to do homage to one of Clancy's sponsees, Carleen.

<p>
The correspondent described the group as, &quot;women were not allowed to wear pants to meetings,
men had to wear ties&quot;. And of course men had to have short hair and be clean-shaven.
All of Clancy's Clones have to put on a super-straight image.
Yes, now you know why your sponsor insisted on you cutting off your hair and beard.

<p>
On the bright side, Clancy's Clones may well finish the job of destroying Alcoholics Anonymous.
They will make A.A. so fascistic and intolerant and insane that people will be leaving in droves,
and the organization will become unacceptable to any but the craziest of doctors or counselors.
<p>
So have a good day now.

Orange,

<p>
I love your website, and I promote it greatly (and just recently got to share it
with a friend who entered AA last month &#8212; he is now seeking
self-recovery...thank you!). I do , however, want to call your attention to
something that may be inaccurate on this page:<br>

<p>
Whilst certain forms of alcohol can be damaging to the brain, and whilst
excessive alcohol consumption can alter the way the brain functions, it is not
actually true that alcohol binges kill brain cells.

<p>
Best wishes to you,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Dave,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments and for helping your friend.
And thanks for the correction. Another urban legend bites the dust.
First, there was no such dinosaur as the Brontosaurus, then Hitler wasn't really
a vegetarian, and now alcohol doesn't always kill brain cells.
<p>
Well, that is actually good news. That explains why I've still got some left.
<p>
I was taught that thing about one good binge killing 100,000 brain cells at least
30 years ago. It really was a long-lived myth.
<p>
Speaking of which, one of those articles mentioned growing new brain cells.
That brings up another very old myth that just died about 10 years ago:
The idea that you never grow any new brain cells. The old story was that
you were born with all of the neurons that you will ever have, and you just
slowly lost them during your life.
And there was some sense to it, because if your neurons were
reproducing by splitting in two,
it would mess up the logic functions that depended on which neuron was connected
to which.
<p>
But recent research found that you actually have a lump
of stem cells in the center of the brain, and they reproduce, and then some of
the offspring stem cells differentiate into neurons. Then the new neurons actually crawl
around on their little dentrites, looking for an empty slot where a brain cell
died, and when they find such a hole, they crawl into it and plug themselves in
and start growing connections to neighboring neurons.

<p>
It's almost unbelievable, but true. The research was published in the British
medical journal <i>Lancet</i>, among other things.

<p>
So, the neurons don't die by the hundreds of thousands just because we get drunk,
and we can grow some replacements after we have killed some off.
There is hope for us yet.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	After searching restlessly for your e-mail, I believe I have found it.<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
Perhaps instead of looking at how many people don't stay sober in the AA
program, you should look at how many people do. I understand you're not an
alcoholic or a drug-addict so this might sound senseless to you. I will use
myself as an example. When I was using I was an unemployable, home-less at
times, criminal, who actively and more often then daily injected Heroin. Perhaps
for a man that would not be so bad, but I am a 19 year old female. Most
EVERYTHING Bill talks about in the Big Book, I can relate to &amp; I honestly
believe that book has given me a new life. When you take someone who felt like
they had absolutely nothing to offer this world and turn them into someone who
can help other people and connect with God, it is a feeling that I'm sure no one
besides an alcoholic can encounter. I wish I could let you borrow this feeling
because it is nothing less then phenomenal. For me, it doesn't matter what Bill
did, if he smoked himself to death or had an affair. It doesn't matter what
other people have done. It is no doubt that alcoholics are mentally sick, some
sicker than others. It is the solution that brings us back to health. Also, I
believe that anyone who can stop drinking WITHOUT AA is not a real alcoholic,
perhaps a moderate-heavy drinker but, I do not believe they have any idea about
the phenomenon of cravings that us real alcoholics experienced and felt.

<p>
Thanks for your time.

<p>
Please don't try to twist my words around like you have with the other AA's who
have e-mailed you.

<p>
Sammi

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sammi,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I do not twist the words of people who write to me.
But if someone is wrong about something, I will say so.
<p>
Like you started your letter by saying that I was not an alcoholic or addict,
so presumably I don't know what I'm talking about.
<p>
Wrong, wrong, wrong. I lived on a hippie commune and tripped my brains out for years.
I took LSD and other psychedelics at least 200 times. I've smoked more pot than
I can count or measure. I tried almost every drug that was available, just to learn
what they were like.
I got Hep C from sharing needles while shooting heroin and cocaine.
<p>
Then I drank too much alcohol for nearly 20 years, until my doctor said, &quot;Quit drinking
or die. Choose one.&quot;
<p>
And now you somehow decide that I'm not really an alcoholic or addict?
You haven't really read much of my web site, have you?

<p>
On to the next point: I most assuredly do look at the successful people who
have quit their addictive behavior. We have lots of discussions about that,
and I have a couple of lists of letters where we have discussed what works:
<a href="orange-letters177.html#what_works" target="newwin7319">The short list is here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters170.html#what_works" target="newwin37">the longer list is here</a>.

<p>
The fact that you enjoy reading Bill Wilson's lies in the <i>Big Book</i>
does not prove that Bill's Bull is anything but lies.
The fact that you get a big kick out of practicing
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>
does not make it a good religion.
<p>
While you are having such a good time, you have to also look at what A.A. is doing
to other people.
The sad truth is still that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin24">A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
on top of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin21">increasing the rates of binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin22">rearrests</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin23">increasing the costs of
hospitalization</a>.
<p>
We can do far better than that, and we are doing better than that.
<p>
By the way, when you say, &quot;it is a feeling that I'm sure no one
besides an alcoholic can encounter&quot;, that is a standard cult characteristic:
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="newwin123">The cult and its members are special.</a>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Only another cult member can understand.&quot;</i></font>

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> says it this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You poor guy. I feel so sorry for you. You're not an alcoholic.
You can never know the pure joy of recovering within the Fellowship of
Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 334.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Devoting our lives to chasing fun feelings is what got us into trouble in the first place.
Now, instead of getting a good feeling from shooting heroin, you are getting a good
feeling from indulging in cult religion. You are still just chasing a feeling.
That isn't any answer to how to develop a sane, positive, balanced, lifestyle.

<p>
Here is what William James had to say on the subject. Remember that Bill Wilson
claimed that William James was one of the two philosophical fathers of Alcoholics
Anonymous. (Which he was not;
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman was</a>.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font size="+1" color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If merely &quot;feeling good&quot; could decide, drunkenness
would be the supremely valid human experience.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
William James (1842&#8212;1910), U.S. psychologist,
philosopher, in &quot;The Varieties Of Religious
Experience&quot;, lecture 1, &quot;Religion and Neurology&quot; (1902)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lastly, this line is standard Alcoholics Anonymous misinformation:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Also, I
believe that anyone who can stop drinking WITHOUT AA is not a real alcoholic,
perhaps a moderate-heavy drinker but, I do not believe they have any idea about
the phenomenon of cravings that us real alcoholics experienced and felt.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, no matter how fervently you believe it, that is not true at all.
The vast majority of alcoholics who quit drinking do it on their own, without A.A. or any
treatment or &quot;support group&quot;. And yes,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank">they are &quot;real alcoholics&quot;</a>.
The NIAAA says that 75% of all recovered alcoholics quit
drinking on their own, and the Harvard Medical School says 80%.
Alcoholics Anonymous is quite unnecessary.
<p>
And A.A. members do not have any special knowledge that is denied to the rest of us.
So you felt some cravings. So what? So have I. You just say, &quot;No, I'm not going
to drink, or smoke, or drug, any more. I'm not going to die that way.&quot;
Problem solved.

<p>
And isn't there an A.A. slogan that says, &quot;Feelings aren't facts.&quot;?
Cravings are just feelings. You don't have to let them run your life. Consider this:
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
<b>Self Discipline and Patience</b><br>
&quot;Discipline&quot; is a difficult word for most of us. It conjures up images
of somebody standing over you with a stick, telling you that you're
wrong. But self-discipline is different. It's the skill of seeing
through the hollow shouting of your own impulses and piercing their
secret. They have no power over you. It's all a show, a deception. Your
urges scream and bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they threaten;
but they really carry no stick at all. You give in out of habit. You
give in because you never really bother to look beyond the threat. It is
all empty back there. There is only one way to learn this lesson,
though. The words on this page won't do it. But look within and watch
the stuff coming up &#8212; restlessness, anxiety, impatience, pain &#8212; just watch
it come up and don't get involved. Much to your surprise, it will simply
go away. It rises, it passes away. As simple as that. There is another
word for self-discipline. It is patience.<br>

Hi, Orange.

Hello again, Researcher,

I have read over several times
<a href="orange-letters229.html#sober_by_choice" target="_blank">the post by Sober-by-Choice (CCXXIX Mar 17, 2011)</a>
and have to say it is a brilliant and damning piece of investigative reporting. For all
intents and purposes the forces of truth allied against Steppism had a mole inside
the Cult's temple.
<p>
The account clearly shows an institution/organisation and a philosophy on the
ropes and taking punches it cannot sustain, which may well bring it to being
knocked out cold on the mat. It also shows Wilson's Step Cult to be (at the top
of the pyramid and near the top) very much a money making cult. Yes indeed, the
dough we put in those baskets wasn't going to buy coffee and pecan
sandies &#8212; no, it was funding big $ salaries and cushy pensions &#8212; and Stepping
Stones and Wilson's harem.
<p>
The &quot;Program&quot; can't go on losing blood like this for long, so I predict there
will be some kind of a reformation to salvage the wreck and re-float it with
new and improved, modern ideas. A new revelation; a new book; a new structure;
perhaps modernised steps &#8212; how about &quot;the suggested movements&quot; instead of the
steps?
<p>
It is a dying cult. Like Father Divine, EST, Synanon, and the Branch Davidians
it is going down! Down into the dustbin of history.

some good insight into something that has been a huge part of my life. I
have often thought that AA instilled in me a guilt complex that worsened my
drinking. I have been going to AA off and on for a while and I am failing to
see any efficacy in &quot;the program&quot; anymore. That does sound so cultish &quot;the
program&quot;. More and more I am seeing I was drinking because of emotional
issues, not physiological ones. Not to say that alcohol is not physically
addictive, I have had one withdrawal seizure in college, so I know first
hand that the body adapts in very profound ways. However my drinking has
always been a choice and AA tries to convince us otherwise. In fact the
longest periods of sobriety I have had were without AA, and I was goping to
bars all the time with friends, they all knew I quit and no one ever made me
feel uncomfortable. I am resentful that I allowed a program dominate my
thoughts and make me feel hopeless. I'm resentfule that all the people I
know there are talking about me and gossiping. I am certain they all think I
am drinking, and it just get's old. I hate that AA has dominated the
recovery market, leaving very little support for other programs. I live in
Houston and in a city this big there is one SMART recovery meeting once a
week, and about five people go.
<p>
 You obviously have a lot of experience with
AA I am just curious, did you quit drinking, or did you never have a problem
in the first place? I guess I am just looking for someone to say I did, I
quit on my own and I am happy, because you won't ever here that in a
meeting. It's just wrong how they discredit any other approach, refuse to
engage in any type of debate, and try to control people. I don't know if you
heard this one but it goes something like this, &quot;AA is brainwashing you but
your brain needs a wash.&quot; I've been told that a few times all by different
members.
<p>
Anyhow keep up the good work like I said it has been very
interesting.

Hello Ryan,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. 
<p>
Taking one of your last questions first, did I have a problem?
Oh yeh. Twenty-two years ago, my ex-wife said that she would not send my son to
spend the summer with me unless I quit drinking and stayed sober for the whole
summer. I said okay, and didn't think it was that big of a deal. About 36 hours
without alcohol and I went into DTs, same as you did. I had never imagined
that I was that addicted or habituated to alcohol, but I was.
It was a hell of a night, one of those nights where you are glad to just live
through it and see the sun again.

<p>
That impressed me enough that I stayed sober for the following three years.
In the beginning, I went to four A.A. meetings, only four, ever, just to see if
I could learn anything useful there. I quickly tired of the routine. I decided that
they were nice people and everything, but I didn't want to spend the rest of my
life sitting around talking about drinking. There are other things to do.
<p>
(At that time, I had no idea that A.A. was a cult. It just seemed like a bunch of people
who spent an awful lot of time talking about drinking.)

<p>
After three years, I was looking at the calendar one day and realized that I had had
my third anniversary off of alcohol a few weeks earlier. I had not even thought about it,
or celebrated in any way, or even noticed it. Then I thought a very dangerous thought:
&quot;It shouldn't be this easy.&quot;  That is, I had learned some of the A.A. mythology about
how alcoholics have to call up their sponsor every Saturday night, crying that they
are about to relapse and all of that. I never went through any of that. I never even had
a sponsor. I went through some cravings for alcohol in the beginning, but they were
manageable, and then they faded out. And then I basically cruised on autopilot for
three years, and staying sober wasn't hard at all. I abstained from drinking simply
by deciding that I wasn't going to drink.

<p>
But then I thought, &quot;It shouldn't be this easy.&quot; I began to think that maybe I
wasn't a real alcoholic after all. Maybe that counselor was just trying to fill her quota
for the month when she labeled me an alcoholic. Then I thought about going into
DTs when I quit. And the little
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>
 answered,
&quot;Remember what that woman at A.A. said: You just had a minor reaction to withdrawal.
Now she <i>really</i> went through withdrawal. She went into convulsions and they
had to tie her down to the bed for three days. You aren't really an alcoholic, not
like her.&quot;

<p>
I still didn't drink again right away, but the idea was planted. A few months later,
I was at a friend's birthday party, and it was wall-to-wall beer and whiskey.
I still didn't drink for most of the night. But finally I decided that I could handle
one beer. It tasted great. One turned into three. I wanted more, but the party was
shutting down, and it was too late to go to the liquor store. The next morning,
when I woke up, my first thought was, &quot;Go get some more beer.&quot;
I held out until noon, and then went and got a six-pack, and thought that I could have
a couple each day, and make it last for three days. They were all gone in a few hours.
<p>
And that was the beginning of nine more years of drinking, which ended in
sickness and homelessness, and the doctor telling me &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
<p>
Yes, I think I had a little problem with alcohol.

<p>
About quitting on my own, yes, I did, twice.
And I think you can count both times as successful. The first time, I stayed sober
for three years, and this time, it's ten years and I don't intend to ever drink again,
or get fooled again.
<p>
And, the second time, I had two weeks of sobriety before
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">I started a &quot;treatment program&quot;</a>
that sent us to A.A. and N.A. meetings.
I agreed to participate in an outpatient treatment program in trade for housing,
so that I wouldn't be homeless and have to sleep in the rain. 
The treatment basically consisted of &quot;group therapy&quot; meetings twice a week,
where we sat around and talked about drinking and drugging, and
then we had to go to A.A. or N.A. meetings at least three times a week.
It was quite useless. The major thing that I learned is that the 12-Step organization
is a crazy irrational cult.  And then, later,
I learned that my &quot;counselor&quot; in the &quot;treatment program&quot;
was actually a cocaine-snorting Internet child pornographer and child molester.
No joke. They sent him to prison the next year.

<p>
So yes, I count that as quitting on my own, and staying sober in spite of
&quot;help&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot;, not because of it.

<p>
Oh, about quitting on your own: <b>Taper off slowly</b>. The second time, I didn't
go into DTs because I was careful not to shock my system by going from full-bore drinking
to total abstinence in one day. That is not a good way to do it.

<p>
And if you think you are heavily habituated to alcohol, definitely see a doctor.
They have medicines that can keep you from going into convulsions and things like that.
Contrary to what A.A. says, doctors are your friends. I count the doctor who told
me, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot; as one of the best I ever had.
His approach was just right.
No B.S., no &quot;go to A.A.&quot;, just quit drinking or die, choose one.
I must remember to look him up and send him a Christmas card and tell him what happened.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life. And if you have any more questions,
don't hesitate to ask.

Hello Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the good wishes, and don't worry about me. I'm doing just fine.
I have 10 years of sobriety now, and I'm looking forwards to the next 20.
<p>
By the way, A.A. does not really have millions of sober successful people, not
even anything close to that.
That is just one of their standard fairy tales.
You can see that for yourself. You know how many first-day and one-month coins
are given out, and how few 10-year and 20-year coins are given out.
If A.A. really worked, you should see almost as many people picking up 10- and 20-year
coins as are picking up one-month coins. But you don't see that, do you?
A.A. isn't keeping them sober worth a darn.

and

<p>
