<a name="suicide_list"> </a>
I believe that a good case can even be made that Alcoholics Anonymous also increases the
suicide rate of its members. People have sent me these stories of A.A. suicides:
<p>
<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters139.html#suicide" target="_blank">The suicide rate in AA of people sober longer than 15 years</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters19.html#suicide" target="_blank">there was 7 suicides the first year and 5 the second year.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters50.html#suicide" target="_blank">I... saw 2 suicides in that time period.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters44.html#suicide" target="_blank">another sponsee commits suicide</a> after his sponsor tells him him not to take his medications</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters31.html#suicide" target="_blank">I have seen many young men commit suicide</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters31.html#suicide2" target="_blank">That young man, along with at least two others he sponsored committed suicide.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters39.html#suicide2" target="_blank">Two of my sponsors had kids either dead from, or attempted, suicides.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters40.html#suicides" target="_blank">Total of seven overt suicides of people that attended meetings, my first two years of sobriety.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters53.html#suicide2" target="_blank">Out of 60 people 2 suicides (that i know of) in 1 year after &quot;recovery&quot;.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds_suicide" target="_blank">a mental patient commits suicide</a> after his sponsor deprives him of his medications
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters22.html#suicide" target="_blank"> I myself, have heard more than a handful of stories of people I KNEW in AA over the last 17 years, who, on the advice of their sponsor, stopped taking medication and as a result committed suicide because their depression was untreated.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters.html#suicide" target="_blank">Not long after I returned I went to a meeting one night to note that some of the older members were in a rather stunned state. Another older member who attended a nearby group had commited suicide.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_meds_suicide2" target="_blank">another mental patient commits suicide</a> after the A.A. old-timers talk him into not taking his medications 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters4.html#no_meds_story" target="_blank">the source of that story</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters30.html#suicide" target="_blank">more on that suicide story</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters13.html#co_dependent" target="_blank">The Heaven's
Gate suicides in 1997 disturbed me greatly, but when it happened I ran into
immediate opposition within NA to automatically making these people out to be wrong.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters13.html#suicide" target="_blank">that poisonous pedagogy is so harmful that it seems to drive some people to suicides</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters13.html#Smith_suicide" target="_blank">on this same tape Bob, Jr., told the story of his son (Dr. Bob's grandson) killing himself!</a> 
<!---- <P><LI> <a href="orange-letters8.html#suicide" target="_blank">this</a> ---->
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters18.html#suicide" target="_blank">The use of alcohol often stems from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder and/ or psychogenic amnesia where sobriety prior to cure may render the person suicidal and worse off than if they continued drinking.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters28.html#suicide" target="_blank">doctors, nurses, and dentists driven to suicide</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters31.html#suicide3" target="_blank">&quot;Go to AA and all your
problems will be solved&quot;. I was suicidal for crying out loud!</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters31.html#suicide4" target="_blank">I nearly committed
suicide while I was in the program.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters33.html#suicide" target="_blank">I have known of some
violent tragic suicides &#8212; nice people, they just couldn't quit drinking.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters37.html#suicide" target="_blank">Three women from that AA-group had committed suicide in as many months, but nobody questioned themselves or the group, let alone the program.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters107.html#suicide" target="_blank">My first nine months, two new comers killed themselves</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters108.html#horror" target="_blank">I had a sponsor 
by now and was scared that if I didn't go to meetings, then I would go &quot;back
out&quot; and then I would commit suicide, like two people in the program had done
recently.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters39.html#suicide1" target="_blank">But maybe you have to have actually lived
the darker side (watching street people with diseases 13th step young
confused people and see people commit suicide during the
re-socialization therapies), to understand the implications.</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters39.html#suicide3" target="_blank">Trying to defend myself against these crazy, erroneous ideas
caused such a horrifying state of confusion that I could have wrecked my
car... anything.   I almost was led to suicide.</a> 

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters68.html#horror" target="_blank">
...two of my sponsers had dead kids from suicide. You'd have thought that might
stop them from &quot;helping&quot; so many other youngsters.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters100.html#suicide" target="_blank">he did all the necessary stepcraft, and proceeded to take some anesthesia and slit his aorta, causing instant death</a> 

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters126.html#horror3" target="_blank">
A good friend of mine that came from another state, 38, married, good
life ahead, changed noticeably after some dickhead gave him the Big Book,
he told me about it but I never told him what I knew about A.A., and
he killed himself last year.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters165.html#suicide" target="_blank">she hung herself</a> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters175.html#suicide" target="_blank">...lots of people kill themselves after 20 years or so, it is the hump thing</a>.
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters149.html#sister" target="_blank">my own sister had five years sober when she committed suicide in a most horrible way</a>.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters279.html#no_meds2" target="_blank">The suicide rate was almost a dead even 5 percent.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters327.html#suicide" target="_blank">two more suicides</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters342.html#horror2" target="_blank">I knew a woman who was fresh in AA, told to stop her psych meds &amp; when attempting
suicide during a meeting in the meeting bathroom, she was shunned ...</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters352.html#suicide" target="_blank">And two months after my &quot;AA Anniversary&quot; I myself attempted suicide and drank again.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-Midtown_stories.html#suicide" target="_blank">
&quot;they&quot; had told her that she could no longer take her prescribed meds for her depression and bi-polar disease because if she did, she would be &quot;using&quot; ...  at about 90 days she found a gun and blew her brains out.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters410.html#Robin" target="_blank">
Robin Williams commits suicide while working a 12-Step program for depression.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters412.html#Anonymous" target="_blank">
4 people from the <font color="#9F0000">[Deleted]</font> Foundation (the program I was recruited to initially for gambling) committed suicide or overdose in the last month  &#8212;  two being close friends.</a>
