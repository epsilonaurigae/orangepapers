Dear A,

<p>
I was just reading your article titled 'What's Not Good About AA'. You had referred
to AA at one point as a cult. I was wondering if you could expand a bit more on
this. I believe that I lost someone very near and dear to me to what I've come to
think of as the AA cult.

<p>
At first he was in a drug treatment facility. He sounded scared, but still had his
own identity and wanted my support and encouragement. As soon as he left the
treatment facility and started attending AA meetings he almost immediately became
cynical of all that wasn't 'AA'. He abandoned everyone and every activity with
non-alcoholics and became completely absorbed by his AA world.  Is this a common
result of these meetings? Is AA powerful enough to turn an intelligent free
thinking person into a drone who can only deal and live with other AA members and
believe that this is healthy?

<p>
I have struggled to understand what has happened to this once very wonderful person
and would appreciate any insight you could offer.

<p>
Thank You,<br>
Rebecca

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Rebecca,
<p>
First off, for more information on A.A. as a cult, see
the Cult Test,
<a href="orange-cult.html">here</a>.
<p>
The personality changes you are describing are just so typical that it
is heartbreaking. That is precisely what cults do to people.
<p>
About the question:
&quot;Is this a common result of these meetings?&quot;<br>
Well, sometimes. I can't really generalize
or quote exact statistics, but it sure happens too often. Look at
<a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor">this previous letter</a>
which describes a similar case.
<p>
&quot;Is AA powerful enough to turn an intelligent free thinking person into a drone?&quot;<br>
Yes, sometimes. And sometimes no. It depends on the person.
One of the things that cults do is play on people's weaknesses.
Some people are more vulnerable than others.

<p>
For some more good information on getting someone out of a cult, Steve Hassan
has a new book out:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan">
<i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>.
It contains a wealth of practical advice for how to get through to somebody
whose thinking has been taken over by a cult.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hello,
<p>
I have been sober since Jan. 2nd 1977 and have only AA and the 12 steps to
thank for that.
<p>
I pray each day to God and give thanks and ask for help.
<p>
I had a profound Spiritual Experience after I did my 7th Step. At first it
frightened me because I had not experienced freedom from fear and guilt
since I was about 12 or 13 years old.
<p>
Everything that AA said would happen did happen and it also happened to
another fellow I knew about a year later and seeing the change in him was
really astounding and wonderful.
<p>
I have no doubt that the Holy Spirit, God, the Higher Power is directly
responsible for these miracles and I do not get too concerned over the fact
that Jesus is not mentioned in the 12 steps.
<p>
And when someone calls a material object his higher power that is usually
people who have just come into the program and are having trouble giving up
their pessimism regarding what they think of as a link to organized
religion. They usually always change their attitude and thinking on this
after they have been in the program a while and after they have done the
Steps with Self Honesty.
<p>
Thanks for you Web Page and information.
<p>
God Bless, Regards,<br>

<font color="blue">
Hello Robert,
<p>
Thanks for an interesting letter and congratulations on your many years
of sobriety. You did the work, you deserve the congratulations (not some
organization).
<p>
So you had
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#sudden_release">an ecstatic experience
after you did the 7th step</a>?
You got over a guilt complex?<br>
Okay, good, but so what?<br>
That does not prove that A.A. is a good religion, or an effective
alcoholism treatment program.
<p>
You like A.A. because it makes you feel good.
You could say the same thing in praise of the local whore-house.

<p>
You say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I have no doubt that the Holy Spirit, God, the Higher Power is directly
responsible for these miracles...&quot;</font><br>
First off, quitting drinking is not a miracle. It is a very good thing for an
alcoholic to quit drinking, but it is not a miracle.
A miracle is where somebody uses supernatural powers to break the laws of physics
and change reality in impossible ways. No supernatural powers are required to
stop drinking ethyl alcohol &#8212; you just don't put it in your mouth any more.

<p>
Then, why is it that A.A. members rate so highly in God's great plan?
Sixty thousand people die of starvation on this planet every single day.
Most of them have brown or black skin. Half of them are children.
Your A.A. God doesn't bother to give them a miracle, does He?
He just lets them all die.
<p>
Other dark-skinned foreigners are dying in wars &#8212; like in Afghanistan and
Iraq &#8212; or are dying from AIDS, all over the world. But God isn't giving them
a miracle, is he?

<p>
Apparently, the A.A. God is too busy worrying
about whether some white Americans drink alcohol to care about the lives or
deaths of foreigners.
<p>
Heck, speaking of white-skinned Americans, the A.A. God didn't even bother
to give a miracle to the people who were trapped at the top of the
World Trade Center on September 11, did He? Don't you imagine that some of them
were praying like mad too?
<p>
I am reminded of a critic of the Oxford Groups,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">who criticized Frank Buchman's claims</a>
that God was answering his prayers and granting his wishes:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I count it blasphemy for Dr. Buchman, or anybody else, to pretend to
testify to what God has done for him while humanity is at this moment perishing.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Rev. John Haynes Holmes, quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>, July 16, 1934, page 9.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Don't you ever stop to think about the implications of your words?
You would make God into a horrible dictator who caters to the needs of A.A. members
while letting millions of little brown and black children starve, get sick, and die.<br>
<ul>
<li>
Do you really believe that God is such a heartless monster?<br>
<li>
Do you really believe that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">Alcoholics Anonymous
members are that important to God</a>?
(Ego, ego, ego...)
</ul>

<p>
This issue is old hat. Bill Wilson broached the subject in the <i>Big Book</i>
back in 1938, but he never answered his own question:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery that religious
dispute had facilitated, made me sick. I honestly doubted whether, on
balance, the religions of mankind had done any good. Judging from what
I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human affairs was
negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest. If there was a Devil,
he seemed the Boss Universal, and he certainly had me.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 1, <i>Bill's Story</i>, page 11.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Fitz M. mentioned the same issue in his story in the first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>OUR SOUTHERN FRIEND</i><br>
What is life all about anyway? &nbsp; ... &nbsp; Religion is a racket.
How could there be a loving <font color="#BF0000">God</font> who would allow
so much suffering and sorrow? Bah!
Don't talk to me about <font color="#BF0000">religion</font>. &nbsp; ...
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Steppers like to declare that such thinking is silly &#8212; that it's just the thinking
of a beginner.
<i>&quot;He will eventually learn to think right.&quot;</i>
(That is the cultish idea that
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong">Newcomers can't think right</a>.)

<p>
But the true believers are just avoiding the issue.
Neither Bill Wilson nor Fitz M. answered that question about how or why a micro-managing
God would let such massive pain and suffering happen to most of humanity
while helping only a few A.A. members.
Bill and Fitz just blissed out and declared that having a
spiritual experience is wonderful and everybody ought to get one.
They got drunk on spiritual make-believe, and never answered their own question.
<p>
I have never heard a stepper sincerely address these issues and explain
how their micromanaging God can be more than happy to take care of steppers'
wills and lives for them (Step Three),
and grant them
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle">miracles on demand</a> (Step Seven),
while ignoring millions of sick and starving children elsewhere.
<p>
Does drinking alcohol really make God care about you more?
<p>
More on that subject <a href="orange-heresy.html#God_anything">here</a>.

<p>
You say of newcomers,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;And when someone calls a material object his higher power that is usually
people who have just come into the program and are having trouble giving up
their pessimism regarding what they think of as a link to organized

<p>
Is that really it? What is so bad about organized religion?<br>
Why do we so often get this
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_denigrate_others">
cultish game of spiritual one-upmanship</a>
from the A.A. true believers? &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html">Organized religion is bad, but A.A.

<p>
I am far more concerned about
<a href="orange-cult.html">A.A. being a cult religion</a>
than that it might
be some kind of an introduction to mainstream religions.
<p>
Then it is a ridiculous heresy for a sponsor to tell newcomers that they
can use a bedpan or a motorcycle or a
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#G_O_D">Group Of Drunks</a>
as their Higher Power for a while &#8212; you know,

until they get converted to the standard A.A. beliefs.

<p>
Then you say of newcomers,
<font color="#4f007f">

</font>
Do you have any idea how chilling those words sound to the rest of us?<br>
What you are saying is that the A.A. indoctrination and brain-washing program
really works after a while.
Newcomers may think independently in the beginning, but they will eventually
learn to conform and parrot the standard party line.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<ol>
<li>  Bill Wilson would cater to every audience he spoke in front of exactly what he
thought they wanted to hear.  Audiotaped talks at Akron Founders Days between
1954-1962 are an example.  He often spoke of the Carl Jung &#8212; Rowland Hazard link to
AA, and in front of the typical audience (i.e. International Conventions), he would
allude to Rowland as having a &quot;spiritual experience.&quot;  Yet at one Founders Day talk,
he said the same thing, but then added, &quot;We can be frank here.  He had a religious
conversion.&quot;

<p>

[The Jung debate continues here:

<p>
Bill would often speak of AA as being a &quot;synthesis of religion and medicine.&quot;  In
these same Akron Founders Day tapes, he said, &quot;By far the most influential source
was religion.&quot;  You will not find this anywhere else.

<p>
There are several examples like this.  He had always called the Akron-Midwest crowd
the &quot;ultraconservatives,&quot; and he did not shy away from being open about religion in
front of them.

<p>
<li>  Become familiar with the Big Book's First Edition stories.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>
&gt;From Tom Lucas of Akron, <i>&quot;My Wife and I&quot;</i>:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Here were these men who visited me and they, like myself, had tried everything else
and although it was plain to be seen none of them were perfect, they were living
proof that the sincere attempt to follow the cardinal teachings of Jesus Christ was
keeping them sober.  If it could do that for others, I was resolved to try it,
believing it could do something for me also.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&gt;From Jim Scott of Akron, <i>&quot;Traveler, Editor, Scholar&quot;</i>:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I had never, since the believing days of childhood, been able to conceive an
authority directing the universe.  But I had never been a flippant, wise-cracking
sneerer at the few persons I had met who had impressed me as Christian men and
women, or at any institutions whose sincerity of purpose I could see.  No conviction
was necessary to establish my status as a miserable failure at managing my own life.
I began to read the Bible daily and to go over a simple devotional exercise as a
way to begin each day.  Gradually I began to understand.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&gt;From Bill Van Horn of Akron, <i>&quot;A Ward of the Probate Court&quot;</i>:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;This doctor (Dr. Bob) in plain words was a wonderful guy &#8212; he spent many hours with
me telling me his experience with alcohol.  Others of his band, which then was
small, visited me &#8212; told me their stories.  They were all strangers to me, but
treated me as a friend.  I was impressed with their interest and fellowship.  I
learned the secret.  They had a religious experience.  I was willing, and renewed my
acquaintance with God and acknowledged Him as a reality.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
&gt;From Bob Oviatt of Akron, <i>&quot;The Salesman&quot;</i>:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;They made it very plain that I had to seek God, that I had to state my case to Him
and ask for help.  Prayer was something I had long forgotten.  I think my first
sincere utterance must have sounded pretty weak.  I didn't experience any sudden
change, and the desire for liquor wasn't taken away overnight, but I began to enjoy
meeting these people and began to exchange the liquor habit for something that has
helped me in every way.  Every morning I read a part of the Bible and ask God to
carry me through the day safely.&quot;

</blockquote>
</ol>

<p>
***IMPORTANT NOTE***
The latest AA Conference-approved offering, <i>Experience, Strength &amp; Hope</i> (2003),
contains the First Edition stories.  HOWEVER, an editor took the liberty of writing
this gratuitous statement (pp. 2-3)

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Much of the terminology is strange to us: they wrote of 'former alcoholics,'
described their recovery as a 'cure,' and referred to alcohol in terms such as 'John
Barleycorn.'...
Some of the rough edges found in the first edition stories (the use of profanity,
for example, references to specific religious beliefs, and several rather
disorganized stories) would be smoothed out in those chosen for later editions...
But with all their faults of style, the differences between the stories we hear
today and those written in 1939 are not important.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Religion was &quot;smoothed out&quot; to the tune of a 5% success rate
(at best)!  This is according to AA itself
(<i>&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">Comments on AA's
Triennial Surveys</a>,&quot;</i> 1989)

<p>

Here are some other important excerpts from notable folks who were witnesses to the
early days:

<p>
&gt;From Dr. William Duncan Silkworth, MD:<br>
<i>&quot;A New Approach to Psychotherapy in Chronic Alcoholism&quot;</i><br>
&gt;From the Journal-Lancet: Vol. 46, July 1939:<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;This peculiar ability, which an alcoholic who has recovered exercises upon one who
has not recovered, is the main secret of the unprecedented success which these men
and women are having.  They can penetrate and carry conviction where the physician
or the clergyman cannot.  Under these conditions, the patient turns to religion with
an entire willingness and readily accepts, without reservation, a simple religious
proposal.  He is then able to acquire much more than a set of religious beliefs; he
undergoes the profound mental and emotional change common to religious
'experience.'...It is paramount to note that the religious factor is all important
even from the beginning.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

If none of the above convinces, this one will do the trick.  Whenever someone asks
GSO for a response to the &quot;religious&quot; question (or about anything for that matter),
the standard reply is &quot;Nobody speaks for AA.&quot;  On this note, I wish to give you a
short article I wrote on Conference-approved literature and the &quot;Voice of AA&quot;:

<p>

&quot;AA General Service Conference-approved literature&quot;:

<p>
The Collective &quot;Voice&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous States &quot;AA is Religious&quot;

<p>
In order to determine what is the &quot;official&quot; definition of Alcoholics Anonymous
regarding its &quot;religious&quot; characteristics, it is vital to understand the role of the
General Service Conference with regards to AA's literature.  All books and pamphlets
produced, published and distributed by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. are
first reviewed and then formally adopted at AA's annual General Service Conference.
The following excerpt is from the &quot;AA Service Manual&quot; (S129):

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A. as a Publisher

<p>
&quot;Very early, AA made the decision to be its own publisher, a decision that has meant
a great deal to the unity and growth and general good health of the movement.  By
acting as its own publisher, AA can be sure that its highly successful recovery
program is not tampered with by those who may be well-meaning but overzealous.  The
program and the Traditions go on unchanged &#8212; in essence and in presentation.

<p>
AA publishes all its own books and pamphlets and its own magazine.  The addition of
a new book or pamphlet is not approached lightly.  First, the need is well
researched by everyone involved in literature: Conference and trustees' committees,
the publishing company, and all AA staff members.  In many cases, the need does not
appear to be urgent or broad enough to justify a new publication.  If the need is
strongly apparent, work is started.  The first four books were written by Bill W.
Since then, all literature has been written by AA's who take great pains to gather
their material from all over the movement.  From the first draft to the last (there
have been as many as seven), committee and staff members &#8212; and frequently a broadly
representative special panel &#8212; are free to criticize and to suggest, underlining
what they feel will best express the AA point of view.  This process takes time &#8212; 
months &#8212; but the results are worth the effort.  When the pamphlet or book is finally
completed, it is entitled to carry the &quot;Conference-approved&quot; seal, having fully
earned it.  AA World Services Inc. takes completed and approved manuscripts and
prints and distributed them.  It runs with business-like efficiency and provides
additional funds, from literature sales, to help support services to groups and to
carry the message to the public.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Equally important is the following statement from the AA Service Manual (Annual
Conference Meeting) (S79):

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;While no one can speak for AA officially, the Conference comes close to being AA's
voice.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
As expressed in the aforementioned excerpts, AA General Service Conference-approved
literature represents the lifeblood of Alcoholics Anonymous, the movement.  Though
any personal stories, reviews, etc. within the literature may not have been written
by the co-founders or by members of Alcoholics Anonymous, any and all material
located within the literature, as expressed by the AA Service Manual, have undergone
a thorough critique, analysis and approval before the General Service Conference.
Hence, all &quot;AA General Service Conference-approved literature&quot; is deemed appropriate
for representation of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
With this in mind, the most important, and highly revealing, body of evidence as to
the &quot;religiosity&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous can be found in the book <i>Alcoholics
Anonymous Comes of Age</i>, first published in 1957.  Under &quot;Appendix E:d&quot;, a 1939
review of the text Alcoholics Anonymous by Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick can be found on
pages 322-324.  This document is an AA General Service Conference-approved
indictment of Alcoholics Anonymous as indisputably being a &quot;religious&quot; program.
Excerpts:

<p>
From  <i>&quot;1939 BOOK REVIEW OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS&quot;</i><br>
By Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick; also a quotation from his autobiography

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The core of their whole procedure is religious.  They are convinced that for the
hopeless alcoholic there is only one way out &#8212; the expulsion of his obsession by a
Power greater than himself.  Let it be said at once that there is nothing partisan
or sectarian about this religious experience.  Agnostics and atheists, along with
Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, tell their story of discovering the Power greater
than themselves.  &quot;WHO ARE YOU TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO GOD,&quot; one atheist in this
group heard a voice say when, hospitalized for alcoholism, he faced the utter
hopelessness of his condition.  Nowhere is the tolerance and open-mindedness of the
book more evident than in its treatment of this central matter on which the cure of
all these men and women has depended.  They are not partisans of any particular form
of organized religion, although they strongly recommend that some religious
fellowship be found by their participants.  By religion they mean an experience
which they personally know and which has saved them from their slavery, when
psychiatry and medicine had failed.  They agree that each man must have his own way
of conceiving God, but of God Himself they are utterly sure, and their stories of
victory in consequence are a notable addition to William James'  'Varieties of
Religious Experience.'&quot;

<p>
The next excerpt from the same Appendix of
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> quotes
Dr. Fosdick's autobiography, <i>The Living of These Days</i>.
Referring to Dr. Fosdick's
quotes as &quot;generous&quot; (and not &quot;misleading&quot;), in reads, in part:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Month after month I read the Grapevine, AA's official journal &#8212; about the moving
collection of testimonies to the possibility of personal transformation of which I
know.  Moreover, these testimonies bear witness to religion's reality, for
Alcoholics Anonymous is deeply religious.  That Eleventh Step is an essential factor
in its program: 'Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious
contact with God, as we understand Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for
us and the power to carry that out.' The meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous are the
only place, so far as I know, where Roman Catholics, Jews, all kinds of Protestants,
and even agnostics get together harmoniously on a religious basis.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Whenever an AA General Service Office representative is officially asked about the
position of AA being religious, he/she usually gives this response: &quot;I cannot speak
for AA.&quot; At the same time, if the question was reversed, and if the representative
was asked if Alcoholics Anonymous is a &quot;spiritual, not religious&quot; program, he/she
will immediately verify that question with a &quot;Yes, you're right&quot;
answer. This type of practice, hiding behind &quot;anonymity&quot;
traditions to avoid so-called &quot;controversial&quot; topics, has been
going on for years.

<p>
For the subject at hand, it doesn't matter.
The &quot;Voice of the AA Group Conscience,&quot;
in the form of Conference-approved literature, speaks louder than words. And it
cannot hide behind anonymity, for it is on print and available for all to see.

<p>
It speaks for itself.

Thanks for the letter. That is an interesting essay.
<p>
I especially like the way that the author exposed the behavior of
<i><font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I cannot speak for AA (except for when I do)&quot;</font></i>.
I hear the same thing too. People send me letters which begin,
<i><font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I cannot speak for A.A., because nobody is authorized to speak
for A.A...&quot;</font></i>
and then they spend the next five minutes speaking for A.A.,
singing the praises of A.A., and justifying
and rationalizing its doctrines and practices, all while &quot;not
speaking for A.A.&quot;.

<i>THE BACK-SLIDER</i>, by Walter Bray:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In one hospital, a Catholic Institution, one of the sisters had talked <font color="#BF0000">religion</font> to
me and had brought a priest in to see me. Both were sorry for me and
assured me that I would find relief in Mother Church.
I wanted none of it. "If I couldn't stop drinking of my own free will,
I was certainly not going to drag <font color="#BF0000">God</font> into it," I thought.
&nbsp; ...
<p>
This doctor came and sat beside my bed. He tried to cheer me up about my future, pointed out I was still a young man with the world to lick and insisted that I could do it if I really wanted to stop drinking. Without telling me what it was, he said he had an answer to my problem and condition that really worked.
&nbsp; ...
<p>
He simply asked me to make a practical application of beliefs I already held theoretically but had forgotten all my life. I believed in a <font color="#BF0000">God</font> who ruled the universe. The doctor submitted to me the idea of <font color="#BF0000">God</font> as a father who would not willingly let any of his children perish and suggested that most, if not all of our troubles, come from being completely out of touch with the idea of <font color="#BF0000">God</font>, with <font color="#BF0000">God</font> Himself. All my life, he said, I had been doing things of' my own human will as opposed to <font color="#BF0000">God</font>'s will and that the only certain way for me to stop drinking was to submit my will to <font color="#BF0000">God</font> and let Him handle my difficulties.

<i>AN ARTIST'S CONCEPT</i>, by Ray Campbell:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<blockquote>
&quot;There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which
is proof against all arguments and which can not fail to keep a man in
everlasting ignorance &#8212; that principle is contempt prior to investigation.<br>
&#8212; HERBERT SPENCER&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>
THE above quotation is descriptive of the mental attitudes of many
alcoholics when the subject of <font color="#BF0000">religion</font>, as a
cure, is first brought to their attention.
<p>

It was about this time that I began &quot;flirting&quot; with
<font color="#BF0000">religion</font> as a possible way out.
I approached the subject in a wary, none too reverent, attitude.
...
<p>
There was, however, so much that seemed illogical or sentimental about
<font color="#BF0000">religion</font> in general &#8212; so many doubts assailed
me, so many problems to be confronted &#8212; yet there was within myself a
strong and urgent desire for spiritual satisfaction. The occasional
periods in which I felt a spiritual emotion, I immediately examined with
all the ardor of the inveterate analyst. Was this emotion just a form
of <font color="#BF0000">religious</font> ecstasy? Was it fear? Was it just
blind belief or had I tapped something?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Most men,&quot; wrote Thoreau, &quot;lead lives of quiet
desperation.&quot; It was the articulation of this despair that led to
my drinking in the beginning.
<font color="#BF0000">Religion</font>, so far, had only added to
my desperation. I drank more than ever.
<p>
... He told me very little but what I already knew, in part, but what
he did have to say was bereft of all fancy spiritual phraseology &#8212;
it was <font color="#BF0000">simple Christianity imparted with Divine Power</font>.

The next day I met over twenty men
who had achieved a mental rebirth from alcoholism.
Here again it was not so much what these men told me in regard to their
experiences that was impressive, as it was a sense or feeling that
<font color="#BF0000">an invisible influence was at work</font>.
What was it this man had and these other men exemplified without their
knowing? They were human every-day sort of people.
They certainly were not pious.
They had no &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude.
They were not reformers, and their concepts of <font color="#BF0000">religion</font> in
some cases were almost inarticulate.
But they had something! Was it just their sincerity that was magnetic?
Yes, they certainly were sincere, but much more than that emanated from them.
Was it their great and terrible need, now being fulfilled, that made me
feel
<font color="#BF0000">a vibratory force</font>
that was new and strange? Now I was getting closer
and suddenly, it seemed to me, I had the answer.
These men were but instruments. Of themselves they were nothing.
<p>
How foolish I had been in my quest for spiritual help. How selfish and
egotistical I had been to think that I could approach
<font color="#BF0000">God</font> intellectually.
In the very struggle to
<font color="#BF0000">obtain faith</font>
I had lost it. I had given to the
term faith a <font color="#BF0000">religious</font> significance only.
I had failed to see that faith was &quot;our common everyday manner of thinking.&quot;
That <font color="#BF0000">good and evil</font>
were but end results of certain uniform and reliable
<font color="#BF0000">spiritual laws</font>.
Obviously,
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong">my own thinking had been decidedly wrong</a>.

Normal most of the time, it was abnormal at the wrong times.
Like everyone's thinking, it was a mixture of good and bad, but mainly
it was uncontrolled.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I had been sticking my chin out and getting socked by
<font color="#BF0000">spiritual law</font>
until I was punch drunk. If one could become humble,
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult">if he could become
&quot;as a little child&quot;</a>
before this
<font color="#BF0000">powerful spiritual thought force</font>, the pathway could be discovered.

<p>
The approaches of man to <font color="#BF0000">God</font> are many and varied.
My conception of <font color="#BF0000">God</font> as Universal Mind is after
all but one man's approach to and concept of
<font color="#BF0000">the Supreme Being</font>. To me
it makes sense, opens up a fascinating field of endeavor and is a challenge,
the acceptance of which can make of life the &quot;Adventure Magnificent.&quot;

<i>EDUCATED AGNOSTIC</i>, by Norman Hunt:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
On the third day a man came to talk with me. He was an alcoholic who had stopped! He talked about alcoholism and
<font color="#BF0000">a spiritual way of life</font>.
I was deeply impressed by his seriousness, but nothing that he said made sense to me. He spoke about <font color="#BF0000">God</font>, and a power greater than one's self. I remember being very careful not to say anything that might shake
his faith in whatever it was he believed!
I was deeply grateful to him for taking the trouble to talk with me, but what he had was not for me. I had thought much about <font color="#BF0000">religion</font> and had come to rather definite conclusions. There was no <font color="#BF0000">God</font>. &nbsp; ...
<p>
The next day another man visited me. He, too, had been an alcoholic and stopped drinking. He pointed out that I had found myself unable to handle my liquor problem by myself. He had been in the same position, yet he hadn't had a drink in over three years! He told me of other men who had found sobriety through the recognition of some power beyond themselves. If I cared to I was to consider myself invited to a gathering the following Tuesday where I would meet other alcoholics who had stopped. &nbsp; ...
<p>
May I stop at this point and address a few sentences direct to agnostic or atheistically inclined alcoholics: You can't take less stock in the references made to <font color="#BF0000">God</font> in this book than I would have if this book had been available to me at that time.  To you those references have no meaning. They have simply used a name that people give to a fond delusion.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp; 

Some such thinking must have been going on in your mind as you have
weighed these incredible experiences against your own inability to cope
with a problem that is gradually destroying your personality. Rest
assured that such questions were in my mind. I could see no satisfactory
solution to any of them. But I kept hard to
<font color="#BF0000">the only thing that seemed to hold out any hope</font>,
and gradually my difficulties were lessened. I
have not given up my intellect for the sake of my soul, nor have I
destroyed my integrity to preserve my health and sanity. All I had
feared to lose I have gained and all I feared to gain I have lost.

<i>THE EUROPEAN DRINKER</i>, by Joe Doppler:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

There are alcoholics who have been without any consciousness of <font color="#BF0000">God</font> all their lives; there are some who are actual haters of the idea of a Supreme Being; there are others, like myself, who have never given up a belief in the Almighty, but who have always felt that <font color="#BF0000">God</font> is far off. And that's the way I felt. I had a closer sense of <font color="#BF0000">God</font> during the mass at church, a feeling of His presence, but in everyday life He seemed to be at a distance from me and more as a righteous judge, than an all-wise, pitying Father to the human race.
<p>
Then occurred the event that saved me. An alcoholic came to see me who is a doctor
[Doctor Bob]. He didn't talk like a preacher at all. &nbsp; ...
<p>

&quot;You've been trying man's ways and they always fail,&quot; he told
me. &quot;You can't win unless you try
<font color="#BF0000">God's way</font>.&quot;
I had never heard of the remedy expressed in just this language. In a
few sentences he made <font color="#BF0000">God</font> seem personal to me,
explained Him as a being who was interested in me, the alcoholic, and
that all I needed to do was to be willing to follow His way for me;
that as long as I followed it I would be able to overcome my desire for
liquor.

Gradually, however, <font color="#BF0000">God</font> began to clear my
channels so that real understanding began to come. Then was the time when
full realization and acknowledgement came to me. It was realization and

realization of the fact that I had not fully given my problems to

I suppose there are many who feel a strong resentment against such a
<font color="#BF0000">
spiritual approach</font>. Some of Alcoholics Anonymous whom I have met since
that day tell me they had difficulty in accepting a simple, day to day,
<font color="#BF0000">plan of faith</font>.
In my case I was ripe for such an opportunity,
perhaps because of early <font color="#BF0000">religious</font> training.

This doctor told me that unless I was sincere in wanting to quit drinking, I would be wasting his time and mine and also money in doing this. My answer was I would try anything that would release me.
I went into the hospital and started to build my body up again through proper nourishment, and my mind through a different method than I had ever known of.
A <font color="#BF0000">religious awakening</font> was conveyed to me through some unseen force. I at one time would have laughed at such a possibility because I had tried it and failed because I had not applied it properly. I, at last, was shown the way by these men to whom I am now most grateful.

<i>THE SALESMAN</i>, by Bob Oviatt:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The meeting was informal, nevertheless I was little impressed.
It is true they did no psalm singing, nor was there any set ritual,
but I just didn't care for anything <font color="#BF0000">religious</font>. &nbsp;...
<p>
Some six months later, after a terrific binge, in a maudlin and helpless
state, I made my way to the doctor's home. He gave me medical treatment
and had me taken to the home of one of my relatives. I told him I had
come to the point where I was ready for the remedy, the only remedy.
He sent two of the members to see me. They were both kindly to me, told
me what they had gone through and how they had overcome their fight
with liquor. They made it very plain that I had to
<font color="#BF0000">seek God</font>, that I had to
<font color="#BF0000">state my case to Him and ask for help</font>.
Prayer was something I had long forgotten. I think my first sincere
utterance must have sounded pretty weak. I didn't experience any sudden
change, and the desire for liquor wasn't taken away overnight, but I
began to enjoy meeting these people and began to exchange the liquor
habit for something that has helped me in every way.

Then comes a thought that is like

<font color="green">
[Notice Fitz's use of several propaganda tricks in the line
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Can all the worthwhile people I have known be wrong about God?&quot;
</font>
First off, he is using the propaganda tricks of
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody">Everybody Knows</a></i> and
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#stroking">Stroking Ploys</a></i>.

He is trying to imply that
&quot;everybody&quot; who is &quot;worthwhile'&quot; shares his bizarre
heretical beliefs about God and religion.
<p>
And then he is also trying to slip another couple of propaganda tricks in there:
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii">Assume Facts Not In Evidence</a></i>
and
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#one_similarity">The Fallacy Of One Similarity</a></i>.
&quot;All of the worthwhile people whom he has known&quot; most assuredly did not
believe in his strange cult religion, like he tried to imply, so whether they were
'right' or 'wrong' had nothing to do with Fitz's choice of religious beliefs.
Believing in Bill Wilson's adaptation of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9">
Frank Buchman's fascist Oxford Groups cult</a> was not at all the same thing as believing
in generic Christianity, or believing in God in general, but Fitz glossed over the difference

Subject: Dick B. speaks about AA and religion
<p>

Hi Orange
<p>
I recently have become embroiled in a controversy at an AA chat site about AA's
deceptive recruiting practices. Mainly the &quot;Spiritual Not Religious&quot; AA lie.
I decided to settle this controversy for all time by writing Dick B. and asking him
what he thought about the subject. Dick couldn't have been more kind and gracious.
He relied the same day to my query. He gave me permission to reprint it on the
internet if I desired. It's a blockbuster! When I first printed this on the chatsite
the AA members went ballistic. Anger, insults, diatribes, threats, everything but
the kitchen sink was thrown at me. And I didn't even write the letter. One of their
own members, Dick B, did! Some of the steppers turned on him like hyenas attempting
to devour their own progeny! The whole scene was quite remarkable.
<p>
Here is the letter from Dick in it's entirety and you may use it as you wish. I know
you are very busy but if you get a chance, write me a note and let me know what you
think. Please delete my name.
<p>
Thanks for everything.

1.. Thanks very much for writing and for your astute observations.

<p>

2.. AA is a religion and a religious program.
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges">Five courts have so ruled</a>. And you
only need a dictionary to dub it &quot;religious.&quot; As Mel B. wrote in his title &quot;New
Wine,&quot; probably no one in AA could define the difference between &quot;religious&quot; and
&quot;spiritual.&quot; Just trace AA from its roots: Christian Endeavor and the church
influences from Dr. Bob's youth in St. Johnsbury (see <i>Dr. Bob and His Library</i>).
The Oxford Group, which was called &quot;A First Century Christian Fellowship. (See
<i>The Oxford Group and Alcoholics Anonymous</i>).
Anne Smith's writings and sharings (see <i>Anne Smith's Journal</i>).
Rev. Sam Shoemaker, who was the major source of Big Book
language and Step Language (See <i>New Light on Alcoholism</i>). And the religious
literature such as <i>The Upper Room</i>,
<i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>,
<i>The Meaning of Prayer</i>,
<i>The Runner's Bible</i>, Drummond's <i>The Greatest Thing in the World</i>
(see <i>The Books Early AAs Read for Spiritual Growth</i>).
See it all in Turning Point
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709035358/http://www.dickb.com/turning.shtml">http://www.dickb.com/turning.shtml</a>)

<p>

3.. I personally agree with your analysis of why AA began talking about
&quot;spiritual&quot; and trying to distance itself from &quot;religion.&quot; There is the strong
influence of &quot;spiritualism&quot; which was big in Wilson's life, in Lois's
Swedenborgian background, in Rudolph Steiner, in William James's studied, and so
on. Second, the Roman Catholic Church, for several reasons, opposed the early
practices of AA (King James Bible, confession, a religion different from that of
the Church, and the &quot;heretical&quot; Oxford Group teachings. They could swallow AA by
calling it a &quot;spiritual&quot; program and by saying the Church was the place for
&quot;religion.&quot; Add to all this Nell Wing as a Buddhist, the atheists, the humanists,
and the disenchanted Catholics, and AAs began to settle for &quot;any god,&quot; &quot;nonsense
gods,&quot; &quot;Something,&quot; &quot;Santa Claus,&quot; and &quot;nothing at all.&quot; That just ain't AA &#8212; past
or present. But it feeds the ever-rolling AA publishing, the faltering recovery
programs and treatment centers. And it adds fuel to the First Amendment argument
that compulsory AA violates the &quot;Establishment of Religion&quot; clause in the U.S.
Constitution.

<p>

4.. I'd like to think of myself as a writer, historian, Bible student, Retired
attorney, and recovered (cured) AA who has spent 14 years trying to locate the
Bible roots of AA and, collaterally, to define the other Christian roots of what
began as a Christian Fellowship (what Dr. Bob often called it).
<p>
Was AA Protestant Christian? Yes.<br>
Is it today? Certainly not.<br>
Is AA a religion today and was it yesterday? It certainly is, just as the &quot;humanist&quot; organizations have been so
ruled by the courts.<br>
Can anyone join AA? Not in early Akron AA. Certainly today.
They are arriving in droves and leaving in droves - atheists, humanists, Roman
Catholics, Jews, Protestants, people on probation, people bussed in from treatment
programs, new thought advocates, New Age advocates, and on and on. Anyone!<br>
Is there a difference between the &quot;program and recovery&quot; and
the &quot;fellowship?&quot;
Certainly. And no one has taught the point better than the Big Book itself and
also Joe McQ and Charlie P. in their popular Big Book Seminars.

<p>

5.. Publish away, my friend. There is nothing secret about my views.
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Dick_B">22 published titles</a>
&#8212; more than 150,000 in print. Over 60 articles splattered all over the

Not a dime of profit, but the pleasure
of realizing that lots of people (mostly AAs, and often Christians) are hungry for
the facts of AA history &#8212; whatever anyone chooses to call AA.

I just whipped up this response to an AA &quot;True Believer&quot; about the power structure
in AA. He was claiming that AA somehow &quot;magically ran itself or somesuch nonsense. I
couldn't resist so I crafted this response. Do whatever you want with it just take

To Marvelous:

<p>
Somewhere in the fray I managed to ignore your post. You bring up a very interesting
point about the leadership in AA. AA is essentially a pyramid shaped power
structure. First up the rung in the meeting structure, are the Big Book Thumpers
and Oldtimers. They are the &quot;Praetorian Guard&quot; so to speak of the AA religion and
philosophy. These sage individuals are also the &quot;AA Political Correctness Police.&quot;
When new thoughts, ideas or philosophies interfere with the dogmatic belief system of
AA they are very often the first to intervene with some idiotic comment designed to
humiliate the miscreant/heretic. I.E. &quot;Keep it simple stupid.&quot;

<p>
Next up the ladder in the pecking order is the AA GSO. This organization is
headquarters for the AA propaganda machine and makes sure it's wheels are constantly
being greased by the &quot;voluntary contributions&quot; of the unwitting membership. These
guys and the board of trustees really know how to spend the money wisely! Like on
frivolous lawsuits and fancy broadway shows, expensive restaurants and hotel rooms.
To the tune of one million dollars. MMM must have taken a lot of meetings and
contributions to pay for that!

<p>
AA literature is routinely censored by GSO to make
sure the &quot;Huddled Masses&quot; of Alcoholics&quot; don't get any wild ideas or ask any valid
and important questions! For instance, like
<ul>
<li> &quot;What does <i>rarely</i> mean?&quot;
<li> &quot;Is AA a Religion?&quot;
<li> &quot;Is it possible to get sober without AA?&quot;
<li> &quot;Will freedom of thought and Common Sense get me drunk?&quot;
</ul>

<p>
You know. The usual litany of questions that us &quot;stupid,
insane, powerless, drunks&quot;, aren't capable of answering or figuring out for
ourselves.

<p>
Let's not overlook one of our most treasured tomes. The AA Grapevine. Yes, the
monthly Mein Kampf or Pravda, as it were, designed strictly for the consumption of
the AA &quot;True Believer.&quot;
This serves as the fuel to keep the AA propaganda train rolling down the tracks.

<p>
<a name="Trustees"> </a>
I would be remiss if I failed to mention the AA Board of Trustees. The true &quot;power
behind the throne&quot; as it were, (vacated by Bill Wilsons' death.) These &quot;trusted
servants&quot; are the true intellect of AA. In the true spirit of the mysoginist
tradition of AA there are
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#Trustees" target="_blank">5 women and 15 men on the board</a>.
Give or take one or two.
You get the point. The men get the seats on the 50 yard line and the women get the
ones in the bleachers. These &quot;trusted servants&quot; are paid handsomely for their duties
to the tune of $75,000 a year each or something in that vicinity.

<p>
Yeah Marv, it's just amazing how AA runs without anyone in charge!

<p>
P.S. &quot;Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.&quot;

All the best

Your writing expression is insanely manic;  your ideas, obsessively

I believe the evidence is clear that people can and do recovery from

I suggest you seek out a competent psychiatrist as soon as possible.    I

we entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly angry with self-righteous

Bill did that because he was suffering from a

Is your statement <i>always</i> true? &#8212; is denial the basis of <i>ALL</i> failure to ask

<li> Being poor, dead broke, and living in a country that does not offer
universal health care?
<li> Deciding that one would rather die and leave an inheritance to his children
rather than blow the family fortune on medical care that will only buy a few
more years of suffering?
<li> How about just not knowing that one is mortally ill?
Ignorance can be a reason for &quot;failure to ask

Bottom line is, that if what you are doing seems to work for you, and it
works consistently, then why change?  Right?  

<p><font color="blue">
No, actually, the bottom line is that people are being illegally and
unconstitutionally
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">sentenced,
pressured, coerced, pushed</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">conned and deceived</a> into
a religious cult
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">whose program
<i>does not</i> work</a>. You keep overlooking that ugly fact.
<p>
It is also felony fraud to foist quack cures and voodoo medicine on sick people
and then charge their health insurance for &quot;treatment&quot;.
<i>That</i> is the bottom line.
<p>
(Incidentally, I was just reading the November 2002 issue of the <i>AA Grapevine</i>,
and pages 32 and 33 summarized the results of the latest General Service Office
membership survey, and it reported that
61% of the current members were pushed or coerced into A.A. by the courts,
criminal justice system, or health care systems.
If A.A. is so wonderful, why do you have to force so many people
to join it?)

But, if it's not working (and only you can answer that question honestly to
yourself &#8212; but from this end, I have to say it doesn't appear to be
working), then there are other answers that may provide you relief and give
you the results you desire.

What do you mean by &quot;<i>IT</i> is not working&quot;?
I don't do the 12-Step cult religion routine at all.

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
Your site is one of the best sites I've ever seen which contains
information on propaganda and debate techniques. I have captained a
couple [of] debates whereby our team won not so much by our team's position
or research quality, but by the fact we were able to show that the other
team was appealing. I am glad to see such access-ease to so much
practical information as I write dozens of letters to editors and
politicians regarding societal issues.

<p>
After reading sections of the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html" target="_blank">PROPOGANDA AND DEBATE TECHNIQUES</a>,
I feel additional empowerment necessary to win arguments or change a person's
issue position. I will continue to draw from my newly-found resource,
ORANGE-PAPERS. In the event I cite any of your material, I will
certainly refer to you in my source list.

<p>
I want to thank all involved in the ORANGE-PAPERS' creation, and I will
direct as many truth advocates as I can to your site.

Hi, Dan,

That is really flattering. Thanks much.

And I know what you mean by the feeling of being empowered.
As I put the page together, and gathered information about
all of those techniques, I sort of felt like I had stumbled
across a Rosetta Stone or something. All kinds of political
garbage and speech stunts became transparent.
I now listen to politicians with that list in mind, and say
to myself, &quot;Now he's using blah, and now it's blah-blah,
and now it's this other thing...&quot;

But it is kind of appalling when you see that some politicians'

Again we meet Mr. Orange,
<p>
You are a thinker.  You are a rebel.  You hate A.A.  We are about the same age.  I
was a straight drunk with some LSD background in the 60's.  I come from an abused
home.  I am a Viet Nam era vet.  I am well educated and a professional.  I &quot;failed&quot;
at A.A. for 14 years.  I have been sober for a good while.  We do have some things
in common.

<p>
You claim that you cannot ever pick up a drink again....  Hogwash......  That is
A.A. fear and paranoia.  With substantial sobriety (detoxifying) and never
forgetting where alcohol has taken us, we can drink if we are careful.  We can even
get drunk once in a while.  But the vast majority of us don't because alcohol doesnt
work for us anymore.  THAT is why we long timers dont drink anymore.  It just isnt
discussed in meetings at all.  Or on your website.

<p>
I am in contact with Harvard University with this concept. (former student)
Something biochemically changes with age and substantial sobriety.  I do not agree
that either you or I quit simply because we were sick and tired of being sick and
tired.  We quit because our bodies were able to because of age or whatever.  If one
will chat very secretly with old timers in sobriety, one will find out that most of
them have tried to return to drinking and it &quot;just didnt work anymore.&quot;  (ever hear
that one in meetings?)

<p>
My wife works in the medical profession and she allowed me (very nervously) to
experiment with alcohol.  (No, I didnt drive a motor vechicle at any time either.)
My &quot;desire&quot; to drink is simply gone.  The euphoria of the drunk isnt there.  I do
beleive that I could re- addict with enough effort just like anyone else.  It will
take many years for this &quot;disease&quot; of addiction to come directly to the floors of
real medical science.  Until then, it will take people like myself, experimenting
with my body and mind, to get some kind of data for the professionals to work with.
I personally beleive that someday, some form of LSD induced therapy, will prevail
for the illness of addiction.

<p>
I am not as square as you may think Mr. Orange.

<a name="genetic_alcoholic"> </a>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Tom,
<p>
Well, I must certainly thank you for an intriguing and provocative letter,
but I have to strongly disagree with your ideas about controlled drinking.
<p>
The truth is that <i>*some*</i> alcoholics can return to drinking and keep
it moderate and under control, and some cannot.
The Rand Corporation report on alcoholism,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1">
<i>Alcoholism and Treatment, Rand Corporation Report R-1739-NIAAA</i></a>,
by Dr. J. Michael Polich,
Dr. David J. Armor, and Harriet B. Braiker, Ph.D., in 1978, found that about half
of the alcoholics who recover from chronic alcohol abuse
(i.e., &quot;alcoholism&quot;) do it by total abstinence, while the other
half do it by tapering off into controlled drinking.
<p>
The crucial trick for us alcoholics who want to live
is to figure out which half we belong in.
<p>
In his book on SOS recovery,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS">
<i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-step Programs</i></a>,
James Christopher
interviewed Dr. Kenneth Blum, the doctor who discovered the first gene
for alcoholism. Dr. Blum's take on this question was that genetic alcoholics
cannot drink moderately. For them, drinking even just a little is &quot;taboo&quot;.
I think he's right.
<p>
I am undoubtedly a genetic alcoholic. My father killed himself on it; his mother
was an alcoholic wreck too.
<p>

My own experience on the subject is that 15 years ago, I quit drinking and
stayed quit for three years with no big problem. It was comparatively easy,
after I got through the withdrawal.
<p>
Then, after three years of sobriety, I thought that I could have just one at
a friend's birthday party. I thought that after three years of not drinking,
no cheating whatsover, I had it under control.
That one beer turned into three, which was still okay.
<p>
But what wasn't okay was that all desire to stay sober or maintain sobriety
died right there. Three beers totally killed it.
My three years of sobriety became meaningless and irrelevant.
I no longer thought about staying sober; I was thinking about
how to get more beer, and how to drink without suffering the negative
consequences of habitual alcohol over-use. In other words, how to drink and
just keep it down to a dull roar.
I no longer desired to be sober; I desired to drink.
All of my thoughts were along the lines of continuing a drinking career, not
getting sober. I ended up drinking for another 9 years until things really got bad.
<p>

Perhaps alcohol stops working for some people, but that sure wasn't my problem.
My problem was that it worked far too well.
When I resumed drinking, I could almost hear the Democratic Party
theme song <i>&quot;Happy Days Are Here Again&quot;</i> playing in my head.
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The little addiction monster</a> was in his glory.
He was singing and dancing.
Nobody was complaining that the stuff didn't work.
<p>

The other nasty &quot;gotcha&quot; that I see is this:
<ul>
<li>
If it is okay to have just one, or to get drunk just one night of the year,
like maybe New Years, then it might also be okay to have one (or get loaded)
on the Fourth of July.
<li>
If that works out okay,
then certainly Easter and Halloween must also be okay.
<li>
Heck, one weekend a month will be okay.
That never killed anybody.
<li>
Heck, every Saturday night would be okay. Doesn't everybody unwind on Friday and
Saturday?
<li>
Heck, why wait until Friday? What's the matter with just one or two on Wednesday?
</ul>
<p>
You see where it's going. Once I start down that slippery slope, all Hell breaks
loose. There are very few things in life that are really absolute black-and-white
issues, but for me there are two: tobacco and alcohol. I can either totally abstain,
or I can kill myself on the stuff, but there seems to be no way to just
drink a little, moderately, or to just smoke a little, moderately.

<p>
I can actually moderate on heroin and cocaine, but not on tobacco and alcohol.
Now don't get me wrong, I don't do those things any more, and haven't done heroin
in 30 years. The point is that I was able to just walk away from heroin,
saying that I didn't want to do it any more.
And I didn't even officially quit cocaine or make any effort to quit;
I just stopped doing it because it seemed like a waste of money.
Too many bucks for too little buzz.
But I sure couldn't quit alcohol or cigarettes so easily.
<p>
The lesson there is just that different drugs affect different people in different ways.
And obviously, when you find that some chemicals are extremely addicting to
you, then you are better off if you don't consume those things.
<p>
Now if you can drink moderately, which you seem to be doing, then good for you.
I wish you well. But I'm just not going there. I already tried that experiment,
for 9 years, and didn't like the results.
<p>

Have a good day.

[May 17, 2004, 2nd letter from Tom H.:]
<p>
Thanks Mr. Orange for your well thought out response.  Sometimes I feel guilty about
not letting you know of my REAL feelings about the cult of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
(maybe my use of the &quot;cult&quot; word gave me away)   If you, my friend, are a genetic
alcoholic then I might assume you cannot control your genes and their destiny
anymore than say genetic homosexuality. The gay world has suffered terribly because
of ignorance, as I might assume you would agree with.
<p><font color="blue">
Hi Tom,
<p>
Yes, totally agree. At the risk of sounding like a politician, one of my best friends
is gay (and he has been enthusiastically cheering for the gay marriage court cases,
lately).
<p>
I can't help but remember that I had no choice in the matter of my own sexual
orientation. I didn't read the Bible and then decide to be a heterosexual.
What really happened was,
around 12 to 14 years of age, the girls started growing breasts and I started going
nuts.
They just looked so good, I wanted to get my hands on them. No choice in the
matter at all.
<p>
I really feel for somebody who woke up at 14 and found that he preferred other boys.
</font><p>

If a gay person has no  control over their genes, then would you not have any
control over your alcoholic genes?  Would that not make you &quot;powerless&quot; over
alcohol? There are some concepts in A.A. that are hard to argue even though I
would be first to nuke  A.A. headquarters in New York.
<p><font color="blue">
I would say, <i>&quot;Watch out for the word games, and the twists in the sentences.&quot;</i>
<p>
I would say,
<i>&quot;I have no control over my genes, and no control over the fact that
I just don't react to alcohol in the same way as normal people do. But that does not
make me powerless over alcohol. That's a different thing.
<p>
&quot;I am not powerless over alcohol; I am just powerless to change my genes.
But I can choose to abstain from drinking alcohol, and that is what I am doing now,
so I'm not powerless.&quot;</i>
<p>
And do you know what is really twisty logic? I am still being very selfish.
I abstain from alcohol because I want to feel good. I just don't want to suffer
and die that way (alcoholism and lung cancer).
So I'm being selfish, which according to A.A.
theology, is unspiritual. (So I guess I should go drink to become more spiritual
and less selfish...)
</font><p>

Probably one the most debatable issues with your site is that you nor anyone else
can speak for ALL of A.A.  Sad but true, there are some very hip and understanding
meetings that take place.  But they are as few as hens teeth.
<p><font color="blue">
Sad but true. And I know that I've said many times that you can't stereotype
alcoholics, either in or out of A.A.. That came up in
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Frase2">another recent letter, here</a>.
Every so often I have to say that I have known some good A.A. members.
Unfortunately, they don't control the organization.
</font><p>

A.A. started out for
hard core, down in the gutter alcoholics.  Alcoholics Anonymous is out of control
and is a  dangerous religion.  The biggest mystery of alcoholism is the word
&quot;desire.&quot;
In my opinion, the &quot;desire&quot; word does not have to do with alcohol but
some form of mental illness or genetic dysfunction.  
<p>
Take care my friend.
<p>
Tom H.
<p><font color="blue">
Hmmm. I'll have to think about that one for a while.
I don't think that just having desires, even intense desires, is necessarily
a sign of mental illness. It might just be a sign of being human.
(Now self-destructive obsessive compulsions are something else...)
<p>
Buddha spoke of desire as the source of unhappiness, and taught people to
maximize their happiness by minimizing their unfulfilled desires.
But you can't really get rid of all desires unless you are willing to become
an ascetic monk.
And then even that is another trap: <i>&quot;But Master, how do I get rid of my last
desire, the desire to be free of all desires?&quot;</i>
<p>
In some of the letters that I receive, I hear stories of people who seem to
have a chemical imbalance in the brain that drives them to self-medicate,
in a vain attempt to fix what's broken. I don't know if we should call
that &quot;desire&quot; or something else.
<p>
I'll have to think about that for a while.
<p>
Have a good day, and you take care too.

Thanks for your reply. I have a few questions that I hope you will answer
although you obviously are not required to do so.

<p>
1. Why are you so hell bent on the destruction of something that actually
has provided meaning and value to a large group of people? It has obviously
provided you more value than many of its members. Your life seems to revolve
more around AA than mine and I am a member.<br>

<p><font color="blue">
<font color="#BF0000"><i>...provided meaning and value to a large group of people</i></font>?<br>
You are assuming a lot. 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Other people, including doctors</a>,
including
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">one of the members
of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.</a>,
have found that A.A. does more harm than good.
You also totally ignored the issues of
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">
deceptive recruiting</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coerced_attendance">
coercive recruiting</a>.

<p>
Many cults, including Scientology, the Moonies, the Hari Krishnas, and even
The People's Temple, also claim that they provide
<font color="#4f007f"><i>meaning and value to a large group of people</i></font>,
but it ain't necessarily so...
<p>
You seem to feel that there is something wrong with me if I do a thorough job
and write a lot. If I did not do a thorough job, would you accuse me of
being shallow and lazy and having barely scratched the surface?
That sounds like a good
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind">double-bind</a>.
<p>

</font><p>

2. When you make a mistake, within the documentation that you have
presented, are you open to correction?<br>

<p><font color="blue">
I am always open to correction. Getting the truth out is my number one goal.
I always correct mistakes, and there have been a few &#8212; misspelling Henrietta
Seiberling's name, and saying that King Leopold was Danish...

<p>
I imagine that you plan to immediately tell me where you think I am wrong.<br>
Warning: you had best have a lot of documentation and facts to back up your
statements &#8212; even more than I have &#8212; and it should come from fair, honest,
reliable sources, not
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html">some A.A. propaganda mill</a> or
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys">faked study</a>.
Also be very wary of quoting Bill Wilson &#8212; he lied like a rug and it isn't hard to
prove it.
</font><p>

3. What is the purpose of your work? I have read the secrets to arguing you
have listed and it really does explain a large part of your web site. It
doesn't however explain the extent to which you have gone to research,
prepare, and present information that some must view factual.<br>

[Tue, May 18, 2004, 2nd letter from Brian G.:]

<p>
I am really grabbing for words to express what I feel. Although feelings
have no room in an intellectual world, they seem to go hand in hand with
my thoughts these days. I suppose that is another handicap provided by
AA or maybe I should blame my parents.

<p>
First of all, your view of value and meaning obviously carry completely
different definitions than the way in which I have expressed them. Your
response reminds me of many AA meetings I have attended. The debate of
recovered verses recovering has plagued meetings for years. People will
spend an hour arguing two completely different arguments, and neither
side understands the position of the other. Therefore I will pass on the
opportunity to debate here and will simply clarify my statement.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That propaganda technique is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hit_and_run"><i>Hit and Run</i></a>.
</font>

<p>
Value, is a principle, a standard, or a quality to be considered
worthwhile or desirable. Meaning, in one definition, is defined as, to
have a purpose or an intention. Using these definitions, it is quite
simple to PROVE that these things do in fact exist within AA.

<p>
There are many principles which are communicated and a standard that
when practiced will provide a quality that is viewed within our society
as worthwhile. I suppose these principles and standards could be deemed
as a type of value and would provide something of worth to the person
using them. You may not agree, but AA provides meaning to some people.
It may be viewed as odd or crazy, but there are many people within AA
that do have a purpose and a definite intention. You might view the
purpose and intention as wrong however, it does exist.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a load of double-talk. You could just as easily argue that Scientology,
the Moonies, and Heaven's Gate &quot;provide value and meaning&quot; to their members.
You could even say the same thing for the Nazi Party or the Ku Klux Klan.
The fact that some people enjoy group meetings does not prove that an organization
is good, or that it has a good effect on its members.
</font>

<p>
In my first question I mentioned that AA has provided you with more
value and meaning than many of its members. The cult like intentions,
controlling purpose and religious principles have driven you to work,
promote, and convince yourself and others that your view, supported by
quotes, and pieces of data, are in essence the truth. I have met
evangelical reformers like you in AA and out. They all have on thing in
common. When the plate gets hot they never get off. They just dance.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Neat
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>ad hominem</i></a> attack,
which proves nothing. What am I supposed to do,
&quot;get off it&quot;,
surrender to you, and agree that you are right about everything?
<p>
That is also a cute
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind"><i>double-bind</i></a>:<br>
If I continue to disagree with you, then I am wrong because I won't &quot;get off it&quot;.<br>
If I &quot;get off it&quot; and stop disagreeing with you, then you are right and I am wrong.<br>
Either way, by your illogic, I am wrong.
</font>
<p>

In
your responses, you neatly evaded, (and I know you like that wording),
the basis of my first statement. Your life has revolved around AA more
than mine, and why are you so hell bent on the destruction of this
entity?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. What makes you think you know how much my life revolves around A.A.?
Since you don't know me, and we have never met, you don't know what I do with
my time.
All you know is that I have written a web site.
You could just as easily argue that my life revolves around the Oxford Group more
than yours, or around Christianity more than yours, since I have also spent
time studying and writing about those things, too.
<p>
And, using your same logic, you could also argue that an abolitionist who
worked day and night to help runaway slaves (in 1860)
was more involved in the slave trade than a slave owner
who only occasionally beat his slaves.
</font>
<p>
I have read the quotes you have provided about the trustee and other
doctors. I am aware that there are doctors and other people closely tied
to AA that share opinions as truth. They are free to do so. If you feel
the need to reference those that oppose and or condemn, don't you think
it would be appropriate to quote those that advocate and endorse along
with their supporting evidence? This would provide a more accurate
representation of reality otherwise known as truth.....
<p>
<font color="blue">
Talk about dancing around the issue and trying to dodge the point
&#8212; I quote A.A. leaders and you
say that it would be more appropriate for me to quote somebody else?

<p>
I find that those who praise A.A. are often the best evidence for just how bad
it is. (Even you complained that I was quoting A.A. trustees, like
Prof. Vaillant, who praised A.A..)
<p>
If you have some more A.A. boosters whom you wish to quote, bring them on.
But please be forewarned, just because somebody raves &quot;I love A.A.&quot;,
does not prove that it is a successful treatment for alcohol abuse.
You have to count the failures as well as the success stories.
Unsubstantiated praise is worthless.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote">Proof by anecdote proves nothing</a>.
</font>
<p>
Regarding the first question I addressed to you, I do not have any issue
with your claims of deceptive and coercive recruiting. I am not sure why
you chose to discuss these issues in your response.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I brought it up because you were trying to ignore it. You were claiming
that A.A. <font color="#BF0000"><i>provided meaning and value to a
large group of people</i></font> while simply ignoring the other
side of the coin. There are plenty of other people who have been forced into
A.A. and/or deceived about the
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spirit_rel"><i>real purpose</i></a>
of the program,
who don't think that it was such a wonderful &quot;meaningful&quot; experience.
<p>
It's just like how some women do not find rape to be &quot;meaningful sex&quot;.
It is faulty logic to point to a group of women who enjoy sex and claim that
they prove that forcing sex on some other woman is okay.
<p>
So now that we have both brought up the issues of
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">deceptive recruiting</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">coercive recruiting</a>,
what about it? You say that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I do not have any issue with your claims of
     deceptive and coercive recruiting&quot;.</font><br>
Okay, so what are you doing to stop it?
Do you really believe that an organization that does such things is &quot;spiritual&quot;?
Or even good?
</font>
<p>


People have choices
and for someone to place blame for the way in which they chose to live
their lives is not only foolish but is also a guarantee that continued
failure will follow.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you are trying to use the propanda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#blame_victim"><i>Blame the Victim</i></a>.
<i>&quot;It's just the fault of those stupid addicts and alkies that they don't
like having the 12-Step routine forced on them.&quot;</i>

<p>
I tend to agree that it is pretty much someone's own fault if he continues
to kill himself on drugs or alcohol &#8212; there is an element of choice involved
because we are not powerless over alcohol or drugs &#8212; but your unsubstantiated
statement has nothing to do with the merits of A.A. deceptive recruiting and
coercive recruiting.
</font>
<p>

By your response, I gather that you are somewhat
worried about being sucked in by this type of recruiting.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I just don't like seeing it done to people while A.A. boosters
like you sing the praises of A.A. and tell everybody how wonderful A.A. is.
</font>
<p>

Fortunately
for your followers, your intelligence is superior to the na&iuml;ve
&quot;sots&quot; (ha) that need to be rescued from the evil brain washing of twelve
step programs.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm"><i>sarcasm</i></a>.
You still have not given a single good reason for why people should be forced into
A.A., or even join it voluntarily.
</font>

<p>
It has simply been my observation, but you seem to be (spearheading) a
movement of sorts. Agent Orange is a pretty cool name. The orange
papers! Certainly you are aware and have citied that one characteristic
of cult movements is the idolization of its leader.
<p>
<font color="blue">
What absurd nonsense. I write a single book, and you claim that I am the leader
of a movement? No &#8212; even better &#8212; I'm the leader of a new cult.
</font>
<p>


In response to your
last claim, as part of evading my first question, I don't feel there is
anything wrong with extensive study and documentation. Contrary to your
assertion, I am impressed with your knowledge of the historical data of
AA. I found your web site by seeking information about the historical
past of AA. What I have found turned out to be, not a plethora of
information or fact, but simply a feeble attempt to create another cult
movement. Your extensive study is great for proving to the tired and
weary that have fallen from the grips of AA that you have relief. You
are like an (oasis drinkers are like that you know).
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, to claim that one web site constitutes an attempt to create
a new &quot;cult movement&quot; is absurd &#8212; especially since I spend a lot of time
<a href="orange-cult.html">analyzing and criticizing cults</a>
and telling people how to not get sucked into one.

Moving on, you are very insightful to realize that I would provide you
with a correction. I wish it were on a spelling or a grammatical error
however I am not literate enough to make those adjustments. You have
sited that there was not any stock sold and that this was a bogus and
illegal transaction. You are partially correct however your presentation
is absolutely wrong. The One Hundred Man Corp was in fact a business
name that was created by Bill and Hank. This company never sold any
stock. You are correct about that. Works Publishing did. There were a
few shares sold to investors mostly within AA. There were also a large
number given to the Alcoholics Foundation. This stock was sold for $25
per share and was repurchased later. The certificates have the raised
seal of Works Publishing and are signed not only upon sale but also upon
the repurchase. Your claims that this transaction was illegal are not
correct. The securities act of 1933 and 1934 created by the Securities
Exchange Commission clearly define the rules for selling stock in any
entity. These acts speak of transaction made in public markets as well
as private markets. In addition they discuss the rules that define who
may sell stock and provide exemptions from registrations. This was not
necessarily a public offering of a security and therefore would not
require any registration whatsoever. Your claims are slanderous at best
and are clearly delivered without any type of factual understanding of
the laws defining the securities business. I do appreciate the way in
which you fill in the blank when you have no idea what you are talking
about. Never let them see you down. You Father was a tough man I bet.
<p>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. You are trying to weasle out of the whole thing on a technicality &#8212;
&quot;privately held, not public&quot;.
You had best go read <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> again.
<p>
You are also trying to distort the time line of Works Publishing, Inc..
These are the facts:
<p>
The One Hundred Men Corporation was never publicly traded on an exchange.
It couldn't be; it was never incorporated.
But Bill was certainly trying to sell it to the public.
Bill Wilson plainly, repeatedly, stated that he and Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst
were trying to sell stock to anybody and everybody who came along, including
people fresh off of the streets, during the whole period
of 1938 and 1939 when the A.A. members were busy writing the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Among our new prospects a couple of the more prosperous variety
had just turned up. Henry went after them, brandishing his pad of
Works Publishing stock certificates. They did not want any stock,
but they would take promissory notes signed by the defunct
publishing company and personally endorsed by Henry and me.
Quite unbelievably, Henry extracted $500 from them.<br>
</font>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957), page 174.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>

Bill Wilson was lying when he stated that he and Hank were selling stock in
Works Publishing.
Bill, Hank and William Ruddel were selling &quot;One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; stock
in 1938 and 1939. They were not using the name &quot;Works Publishing&quot;, and
they were not selling stock in &quot;Works Publishing&quot;.
Read
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="pixwin1">the Stock Prospectus</a> again.

<p>
Works Publishing, Inc., a New York corporation, was not
incorporated until June 1940, after Bill and Hank had collected and
spent a small fortune from the sale of stock subscriptions for
&quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;, a Delaware corporation.
(Well, the stock prospectus said that it was supposed to be a Delaware corporation,
but it was never incorporated in Delaware or anywhere else.)

<p>
The name &quot;Works Publishing&quot; was not used until Bill Wilson fraudulently filed
for the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i> on 10 April 1939, claiming
that he was the sole author of the book and the owner of the publishing company, too
&#8212; <b>&quot;Wm. G. Wilson, trading as Works Publishing Co.&quot;</b>.<br>
See the 
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocImgWindow">copyright application
of the <i>Big Book</i></a>.<br>
Also see
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite2.gif" target="DocImgWindow">the back side.</a>
<p>
The fact that other A.A. members later sold stock in a new corporation that was called
&quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; is a different issue
(both literally and figuratively).
<p>
No matter how you try to explain away the switch from
&quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; to &quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; as a mere
name change, it was undeniably dishonest and fraudulent of Bill Wilson to file for the copyright
of the <i>Big Book</i> in his own name
by claiming that he was the sole author of the book and that he was
&quot;trading as Works Publishing Co.&quot;.
The publishing company was owned by everybody who had
bought stock in it, not just Bill Wilson, and the company was not
a sole proprietorship, &quot;Bill Wilson, trading as...&quot;.
Even Doctor Bob's daughter
<a href="orange-Sue_Smith.pdf">Sue Smith Windows stated in a sworn affidavit</a>
that Bill Wilson stole the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund and the copyright of the book.

<p>
&quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; was a completely different
entity than either &quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; or
&quot;Wm. G. Wilson, trading as Works Publishing Co.&quot;.
One simple proof of that fact is that Bill Wilson had to sign over the copyright
of the <i>Big Book</i> to Works Publishing, Inc..
If &quot;Works Publishing Co.&quot;, which owned the copyright,
and &quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; were the same company, then there would be
no need to sign over the copyright.
Here is the original <a href="orange-BB-cpyrite3.gif" target="DocImgWindow">
<i>Big Book</i> assignment of copyright to Works Publishing, Inc.</a>.
This document proves that they were different companies.

<p>
<font color="#BF0000">
[Note that even that assignment of copyright was invalid.
Bill Wilson was not the sole author of the book, like he fraudulently
declared on the
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocImgWindow">copyright application</a>.
He didn't own all rights to the book, so he couldn't sign over &quot;the copyright&quot;.
There were more than 40 other guys, and one woman, who were co-authors of the book.
<i>They</i> did not sign over their rights to their stories in that
so-called &quot;assignment of rights&quot;, so &quot;Works Publishing,
Inc.&quot; never got ownership of a valid copyright.]
</font>

<p>
&quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; was even incorporated in a different state
than what Bill wrote on the copyright form &#8212; New York, rather than New Jersey.
And the original stock prospectus stated that the &quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;
was to be
<a href="orange-Prosp06.gif" target="newwin7">incorporated in Delaware</a>, which
never happened.

<p>
You are quibbling over details in complaining that
&quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot; or
&quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; did not need to be registered with the SEC
because it was not publicly traded.
You act like my whole argument falls apart if you can find a technicality in
the Securities Act of 1933. What I wrote was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Somehow, some time after that, the name &quot;The One Hundred Men
Corporation&quot; was simply quietly abandoned, and then the early
New York Alcoholics Anonymous group
issued a financial statement that purported to describe
the operations of &quot;Works Publishing Company&quot;.
Such conduct would appear to be felonious stock fraud, selling
shares of stock in a company &#8212;
&quot;<b>The One Hundred Men Corporation</b>&quot; &#8212;
that was never incorporated,
never registered with the SEC, and never even existed.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every word of that paragraph is still true, isn't it?
&quot;<i>The One Hundred Men Corporation</i>&quot;
was never incorporated, never registered with the SEC, and it never even existed.
But Bill and Hank still went around selling stock subscriptions in it &#8212; all
that they could. And that is a felony.
Later, Bill tried to cover up what he had done by talking only about
&quot;Works Publishing&quot; when he
wrote the history of Alcoholics Anonymous in <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>.
<p>
Would it really make your day if I deleted the phrase &quot;never registered with the SEC&quot;?
I could do that. It wouldn't change anything.

<p>
It's also misleading for you to say that the One Hundred Men Corporation
&quot;never sold any stock.&quot; They sold stock subscriptions, didn't they?
<font color="#BF0000">
<i>They took money for stock.</i></font>
The fact that they never got around to issuing those shares
is a different matter (one that does not make things any better).

<p>
&quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; was so named as a cover-up.
Bill Wilson had stolen the copyright, and had registered it under the name of
&quot;Works Publishing Co.&quot;, so that was the name that the other
A.A. members had to use as they tried to clean up the mess that Bill had created.
They did not want to make it glaringly obvious to everyone that Bill Wilson had
stolen the copyright &#8212; the only asset that &quot;<i>The One Hundred Men Corporation</i>&quot;
had &#8212; so they also used the &quot;Works Publishing&quot; name.
But it was a new, different, legal entity.

<p>
You are correct in stating that the stock in &quot;The One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;
was never issued; stock in &quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; was issued instead.
You correctly state that the Works Publishing Inc. stock was repurchased.
But even that was
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock3">another crime, cheating the investors</a>.
Bill refused to share the profits with the stockholders when the book started selling:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now that the book was beginning to sell, some of the subscribers began
to demand a share of the profits.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Early in 1940, Bill and the trustees decided that the book
should belong to A.A., not to the individuals who had subscribed for shares.
By issuing some preferred shares, and obtaining a loan from the Rockefellers,
they were able to call in all outstanding shares at par value of $25 per share.
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>'PASS IT ON', The story of Bill Wilson and how the
A.A. message reached the world</i>, Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. staff,
1984, page 235.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The investors did not get a penny of the <i>Big Book</i> profits, not a single penny,
as their reward for investing in Alcoholics Anonymous. They bought stock for $25
per share, and that's all they got back.
<b><i>Bill decided</i> that the investors would not get the share of the profits
that they had been
<a href="orange-Prosp11.gif" target="newwin6">promised in the stock prospectus</a>
to get them to buy the stock in the first place.</b>
That's felony fraud. Bill had no right to decide that the stockholders would not
get their promised share of the profits. (It would all go to the Alcoholic Foundation, and
then become his salary &#8212; undeserved &quot;royalties&quot;. So by a slight of hand
Bill diverted the <i>Big Book</i> profits from the stockholders to himself.)
That is even more obviously a case of securities fraud than anything
Martha Stewart is going to prison for.
