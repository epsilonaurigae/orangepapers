<p>

Throughout the year 2002, Paul Diener posted a lot of very interesting
messages to the mailing list Addict-L, from Kent State University.
These letters are particularly interesting in how they relate
to Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism, addiction, and the politics
of addiction, &quot;treatment&quot;, and recovery.
<p>
In the following letters, I have removed other people's names.
You will occasionally see a name like "DDDDDD", or "RRRRY".
That is because Diener sometimes sharply criticized other members
of the mailing list, and it is not my desire to repeat any
attacks on those people.
<p>
Please note that I do not personally agree with everything
that Diener says, but I agree with a lot of it, and find it
fascinating. In addition, he cites and quotes many books
and papers. I have checked a lot of his references, and have
never found one to be wrong. He knows his stuff.
<p>
Enjoy.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The core of Heidegger's philosophy was the concept of 'spirituality'.
&quot;The question,&quot; he once remarked, &quot;is whether or not we want to make
a spiritual world.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This was the core idea in ALL of the classical fascist movements, too.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The classical fascisms themselves grew out of a broader cultural trend which the historian, Zeev
Sternhell, labels the Modern Spiritual Tradition.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Modern Spiritual Tradition in the West arises in opposition to the
Enlightenment/Materialistic/Naturalistic Tradition, around 1870. These two great intellectual currents in the
industrialized world have faced one another in opposition ever since.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 'addiction' myth needs to be placed within the context of the Spiritual Tradition. This means that
'addiction' professionals should become much more familiar with modern intellectual history than they are.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is disingenuous for an 'addiction' professional - whose field, after all, is part of a vast War On
Drugs funded massively by the American government - to talk about seeing the world in apolitical terms.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need to see the world in political terms, with 'politics' here having its broad, original meaning. That
is, we have to see people as living in the 'polis', in community. What 'addiction' mythology does is create a
non-existent 'individual' whose problems stem from his/her own self, and NOT from connection to the 'polis', to
the community.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But no one is an island in this way, divorced from the main. (Neo-conservatives, like Peele, would like
us to believe in this 'entrepreneurial' vision of the individual, though).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spiritual healing, and crusades for purity, lie at the very heart of the bourgeois reaction to modern
economic crises. If one takes the long and global view - and one MUST start with this view to get the right
context - then the modern Spiritual Tradition is seen as beginning with the Long Depression of the late
Victorian Era.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There has been ebb and flow in the Spiritual Tradition since 1870, correlated with what economists call
'long waves' in productive expansion. During the post-WW II expansion, for example, 'spirituality' seemed a
cultural trend in decline. The 'Religious Right' and the 'Conservative' political movment seemed nearly
defunct..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, with the massive devaluation of the dollar and the oil shocks of the 1970s, the middle class was
thrown into crisis, internationally. A sudden resurgence in &quot;spirituality,&quot; across the industrialized world,
occurred. Appeals for 'purity' and 'traditional values' mount. The War On Drugs begins.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modern 'Spirituality' is a philosophical perspective of a middle-class in crisis. (If you actually READ
Heidegger, you would discover he himself says this.) And anti-'addiction' crusades are a part of this crisis
response.
<p>
<a name="proto"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not all movements thrown up by the spiritual tide have, or will, become political and fascistic. Indeed,
most remain merely diffuse protofascist cults - like the Oxford Groups, or AA, or the various Jungian cults, or
the cultic formations that have embraced the mystical ideas of Heidegger.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such protofascist movements are not great
dangers, by and in themselves. AA is NOT a great danger in the U.S. today.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But AA IS a protofascist, spiritual movement, and its expansion serves as a warning signal to us. AA is
important for what it tells us about where our culture is heading.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To focus ONLY on AA - and, worse, to distort and lie about AA, to wildly exaggerate its 'dangers', only to
promote some other variety of right-wing thinking - is pernicious.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is required is that we step back, and put the mythical concepts of 'addiction' and 'spirituality' in
historical, cross-cultural perspective. We need to see 'addiction' as a core concept of the Spiritual
Tradition, which emerged in the West when the Industrial Revolution first began to falter, around 1870.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will 'addiction' professionals ever do this? Probably not.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Semmelweis won no prize for medical research.
<p>

<p>
16 April 2002
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Some critics of A.A.] fail to place AA in the broader historical
and cultural perspective of SPIRITUAL REVOLUTIONS and MASS PURITY MOVEMENTS.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, as historians like Sternhell, Mosse, Pachter, and dozens of others have noted,
'Spiritual Revolutions', and the Mass Revitalization Crusades for Purity which almost universally accompany
such movements, are a major feature of modern history.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have evidence of Spiritual Revolutions - which begin in the cultural realm, but can move into social
policy and politics, too - from scores of countries. Purifying the nation from 'impurity', curing the
population of its 'spiritual diseases', has been an important theme in industrialized countries from about
1870. But these movements have ebbed and flowed, and have taken different forms in different countries.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have cited scores of works relevant to the topic. The obvious starting point for someone new to the
literature would probably be the Proctor book - written by an Ivy League academic of 'left-liberal' persuasion,
very, very widely praised for its original archival scholarship, and focused heavily upon anti-alcohol,
anti-tobacco, anti-'food addiction', and anti-'sex addiction' in the German fascist case.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AA is like, say, the European protofascist youth movement (the Wandervogel, see H. Pachter, 1982, kWeimar
Etudes, Colombia U. Press, pp. 18ff.). The Wandervogel, and AA, PORTEND great danger, but such movements
virtually never are the actual INSTRUMENTS of that danger. The Oxford Groups, too, was clearly a protofascist
cult. But it was much too disorganized and friviolous to ever be a fascist PARTY.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (re the Wandervogel:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Most [members] abstained from smoking and drinking.... The new morality was for the chosen
community, who, by definition, would be pure and devoted.... The movement was not just apolitical but
antipolitical.... [Yet] the majority [of member's] later became susceptible to Nazi slogans.&quot; in Pachter

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, he doesn't really admit that the government's anti-drug ads 'haven't
worked'. Nor has any proof been presented that they 'haven't worked'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He HAS admitted that drug use in target populations did not decline after
the media campaign, which cost nearly one billion dollars. No surprise
there. But this is very different from saying that the government's ad
program 'hasn't worked'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The U.S. government is run by, and advised by, smart people. This may
not hold for some politicians, but it certainly holds for those who ADVISE
politicians. I don't like the values of DDDDDD, XXXX and their ilk, but I
don't deny that they are savvy. The government is advised by the 'best
brains money can buy'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The government anti-drug advertising campaign has been a success, as has
the overall War On Drugs.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The goal here, however, is NOT to 'reduce drug use in target
populations'. That may be the expressed goal, the 'manifest function' (to
use a phrase coined by Merton). But that is only a cover story. Government
experts are not so stupid that they thought disaffected youths would change
their lifestyle due to a 30-second spot.
<p>
<a name="Untermensch"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The latent function - the REAL function - of the anti-drug advertising
blitz was to increase 'drug hysteria' amongst the American middle class.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, indeed, the most brilliant success of this anti-'addiction'
campaign was the media announcement that the campaign had failed!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For this supposed 'failure' demonstrates to the middle-class that the
government tried to go about things nicely. It advertised and advised, it
informed and cajoled.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the little Untermensch bastards living in Black and Hispanic ghettos
didn't listen, did they?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The obvious conclusion is that 'playing Mr. Nice Guy' does not work with
genetically-flawed scum.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, the government is now justified in turning to means a bit more
'drastic', no?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The billion dollar advertising campaign has been a success. It has
increased bourgeois drug hysteria. And it has paved the way a bit more
towards a Final Solution to the 'addiction' problem.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In last Sunday's Parade Magazine supplement - distributed with many
Sunday newspapers, nationwide - appeared an article on Attorney General John
Ashcroft. Ashcroft was described as a firm anti-terrorism fighter, and as a
government warrior in the battle against drugs. (The Justice Dept, of
course, oversees the DEA).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; Ashcroft describes himself as a believing Pentecostal Christian, whose
conservative Christian faith is at the core of his being. Early in life, he
says, he took a vow never to taste alcohol (along with many other 'purity
vows' he assumed). Every day, Ashcroft says, it is the spiritual realm that
guides his actions.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In <i>Second Opinion</i> (2001, May,
a journal published by the Park Ridge Center in Chicago),
Martin E. Marty speculates about
&quot;Why The Talk of Spirituality Today?&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Marty, at the U. of Chicago, is one of the
nation's leading academic
researchers on religion and spirituality.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The U.S. has entered a Spiritual Revolution over the last several
decades, Marty notes. (Concommitant with the Conservative Revolution in
politics, which forms a part of the larger, spiritual change in our culture
and society).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In healthcare, around 1950, Marty says, secular ideas were absolutely
dominant. (Marty has published over 50 volumes; see esp. his Health,
Medicine and the Faith Traditions, 1982 with K. Vaux, and his Faith and
Medicine in the Lutheran Tradition, 1985). Religion and spirituality at
mid-20th century was seen merely as a comfort offered by the chaplain to
some patients. It was NOT seen as a part of scientific medicine.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Today, however, things have changed. The Spiritual Revolution has
entered the medical and health fields in a dramatic way. Yet, Marty notes,
the traditional mainstream, liberal faith traditions continue to decline.
It is the fundamentalist and charismatic faiths that are surging, such as
Ashcroft's Pentecostalism.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why? One reason, Marty says, is the failure of liberal,
technology-and-science-based social philosophies to deliver the goods.
&quot;Thus, in the heartland of Euro-American cultures, where 'postmodern' elites
now question the Enlightenment Project, there is less confidence in science
as such.... The Enlightenment investments in progress... have turned
bearish.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (I have suggested that this global trend toward spirituality and
superstition relates to the global economy, in which growth has slowed from
above 5% in real terms in the 1950s, to just over 2% in real terms in the
1990s. As the world slips into global economic depression, we are moving,
culturally, into a situation resembling that of the 1930s. Then, too,
spirituality and superstition surged.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Marty notes, the American drive towards Spiritual Revolution is
supported by the elites, while the rank and file of society have sometimes
had to be dragged into this vast cultural movement. This holds in the
medical and health fields, too.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Christina Puchalski, Director of Education at the National Institute for
Healthcare Research, notes that no courses were offered in American medical
schools in the 1950s dealing with the topics of spirituality/religion.
Today, she says, over 60 medical schools (around half of all schools, with
the number rapidly increasing) teach their students about the 'spiritual'
aspects of patient care. Most of these new courses having been introduced
in the last ten years.
(in &quot;Medical Schools Explore Benefits of
Spirituality,&quot; CNS News, go to
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731040153/http://www.CNSNews.com/">www.CNSNews.com</a>).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Harold Koenig,
founder of the Center for the Study of
Religion/Spirituality and Health, at the Duke University Medical Center,
points to some 1,200 studies that indicate the powerful role 'spirituality'
plays in human health, supposedly. Dr. Herbert Benson, another guru of the
spirituality and medicine movement, says he is 'addressing God and belief in
the language of science'
(in &quot;Science Meets Spirituality,&quot; E. Livini, 2000, at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731040153/http://ABCNEWS.com/">ABCNEWS.com</a>).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benson is at Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston,
and is affiliated with Harvard.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps the most notable thing about this whole movement - a dramatic
cultural revolution, which is changing the United States in unprecedented
ways - is that it is a revolution FROM THE TOP DOWN. Spirituality comes
from well-funded centers at Harvard and Duke, and is pushed on medical
students - whether they like it or not. Spirituality comes from Ashcroft in
the Attorney General's office, and is pushed on minor marijuana
violators -whether they like it or not.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spirituality, as Steven Tipton put it in a notable study, is America's
way of &quot;Getting Saved From the Sixties&quot; (1982, U. of Calif Press).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Spiritual Revolution is an elite-led movement of 'reactionary
revitalization'. It provides cultural and superstitious justifications for
dominance by 'higher powers'. Its goal is to deflect popular demands for
MATERIAL reforms in society, and in economic institutions.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Technically, today's Spiritual Revolution is a form of 'protofascism',
which always takes the shape of an elite-led cultural revolution.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have challenged academics who post on this site - eg, ZZZZZZ, XXXX -
to address this critical matter. For starters, I have suggested that they
comment upon Robert Proctor's seminal <i>The Nazi War On Cancer</i> (1999,
Princeton U. Press).
<p>
<a name="purity2"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proctor discusses the Nazi battle against 'addictions' to alcohol,
tobacco, and other 'impure' products and acts. He shows how the Nazis used
'addiction' as a symbolic evil, in order to create hysteria, and foment a
vast 'symbolic crusade' against ALL forms of 'impurity'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Ashcroft, many of the top leaders of the National Socialist
movement were deeply 'spiritual' men, who merged pseudo-medical ideas with
their spiritual superstitions.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proctor's book has been very widely reviewed, and very widely praised
as accurate and important. Yet, DDDDDD and RRRR have so far refused to
comment on the book (or on any of the other of the several score sources I
have cited bearing on this matter).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the marketplace of ideas, academics too often enter only to sell
their goods. They thus avoid embracing ideas that might be unpopular in the
marketplace. They only think what sells.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A commitment to truth, and to the welfare of humanity, demands a sterner
mettle.

Hi Paul...

<p>
It would be nice to believe (if you hate this spiritual sort of thing),
that it was imposed from the top down.

<p>
But the fact is, there are zillions of middle class, working class and
yes, poor people who find in evangelical religions meaning and hope. The
millions of people who have gone to AA represent only a tiny slice of this
group-- but it is far from an elite-only phenomenon.

<p>
In fact, elite academics are amongst the few that admit atheism, for one.
<p>

Same is true with the spirituality/medicine thing-- it's not coming from
the &quot;elite.&quot; Medical schools are hugely conservative in the sense of
resistant to change. It was the patients' embrace of alternative medicine
that drove them to try to bring &quot;spirituality&quot; into the mainstream, not
big bucks funders.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
MXXX -
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is a huge amount of research which bears on 'conversion'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I disagree with both WWWWW (whose approach is 'too hot'), and with you
(your approach is 'too cold').
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Goldilocks, I want an approach that is 'just right'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; WWWWW thinks spiritual converts to AA, for example, are brainwashed and
manipulated by the elite. But the idea of 'brainwashing' has very little
scientific credibility. And conversions to AA are voluntary.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure, those exposed to AA are often under social and economic
pressure, they are given limited information, they are pushed and badgered.
But these are pressures, not 'brainwashing'. Most people resist the
pressures, and reject AA. (Though I think AA has been gradually improving
its 'conversion rate', as its social prestige and influence have increased,
and as America's general Spiritual Revolution has gained strength).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your theory, on the other hand, is 'too cold'. You suggest that
conversions to spiritual movements occur because religous consumers simply
find the 'product' attractive ('it gives them hope').
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is much too simple.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Notice how your thinking betrays a libertarian bias, and posits
'autonomous religious consumers'. But consumers - whether of products or
ideas - are not purely autonomous in modern capitalist states. They are
subject to mass advertising. And they face limited choices, since products
tend to be supplied by oligopolies. Yes, consumers do choose, but UNDER
CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED BY THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC STRUCTURE.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If we were to accept your 'it gives people hope' idea, how would we
explain the explosion in spirituality NOW?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Paul Tillich said, in the 1950s, that the concept of 'spirituality' had
died out in the West, and that it could never be revived. But, today, it
has arisen as if from the dead.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Why now? Surely any 'hope' the spiritual realm offered, it offered in
1950, too.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And spirituality has spread only in some groups, in some economic
segments. It has been fiercely resisted in others. Why?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are some people - the Untermensch? - just blind to the 'hope' that the
spiritual realm offers us? You seem close to saying this, and, of course,
this is John Ashcroft's view of materialistic infidels.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't agree. I think if we look more closely at the economic, social,
and historical variables involved, we will discover why some groups and
classes tend to embrace spirituality, while others reject it.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, the phenomenon is global. Consider, for example, the
collapse of Nasser's secular socialism in Egypt, and the subsequent rise of
Islamic fundamentalism in that country (along with increased alcohol and
drug avoidance). Are we to explain this eruption of spirituality by saying
that the mullahs offer people 'hope'. Is that a sufficient explanation?
Didn't Nasser offer hope, too?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Myself, I researched the rapid rise of evangelical Chrisitianity in
the Chorti Maya area of Guatemala after the military defeat of the peasant
rebellion led by the F.A.R. (Many peasants described the rebellion's defeat
as 'el fracaso de la gente', the 'failure of the people').
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similar sudden explosions of fundamentalist Christianity have occurred
in post-Allende Chili, and in post-Sandinista Nicaragua, and elsewhere in
Latin America.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You see the same thing all across sub-Saharan Africa, where a huge
growth of evangelical and cultic Christianity is occurring, following upon
the collapse of 'African Socialisms'. Ditto in Eastern Europe and Russia.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spiritual Revolutions seem to take place, as Martin Marty says, when
science and material change fail us.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many people, it seems, repair to spiritual solutions at the personal
level when change at the social level appears hopeless. The classic
example, of course, is the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the sudden
explosion of fascist movements across Europe, ALL of which defined
themselves as spiritual movements.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, while Spiritual Revolutions may begin with a focus on the self,
and on 'family values', these reactionary revolutions are not static. They
evolve, grow, and change. The Wandervogel movement was almost entirely
about personal life; but its members later flooded into the Nazi movement.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Common people make personal choices. But their choices are
constrained by the larger systems within which they are encapsulated. And
these larger systems change, too. 'Internal meanings' thus help people
function in a world whose external, changing constraints they mostly do not
control, and may not even understand.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In today's new, meaner world - in which welfare states are collapsing,
and dreams of 'economic development' and 'progress' have turned into
nightmares - 'spiritual' ideologies may, indeed, serve much of the
population as a strategy for coping. These ideologies encourage people to
'hitch up their belts and try harder', they insist that wasteful habits be
put aside, and they encourage the formation of local voluntary-group
cliques, which serve as instruments of mutual aid.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are survival techniques for a meaner era.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But will the world stop here? Will the downward spiral of the global
economy toward economic depression stop today, and go no further?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or will present trends continue? If so, will the Spiritual Revolution
carry us onward, far beyond just a reformation of personal habits. Buchman,
after all, went from the Oxford Groups to M.R.A. And 1950s AA has been
transmogrified into today's 12-Step treatment movement, government funded
and coercive. ZZZZZZ says all this is 'stupid', and
will soon fade away. Not very likely!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look at the Christian Conservative movement. Look at Fundamentalist
Islam. Most of all, look at the history of protofascism and fascism, from
1870 to the end of WW II.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spiritual Revolutions BEGIN as movements of personal transformation, but
they can easily become movements of social revolution.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As intellectuals, we need to connect the personal life of meaning,
with the larger political and structural constraints which limit our choices
and channel our efforts. And we need to speak the truth about power.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Spiritual Revolution in the U.S. - and in the world - is the most
important phenomenon of our time. The crusade against 'addictions' and for
'personal purity' is part of this larger phenomenon. We need to put things
into context.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, [neither of two others] will comment on the much reviewed
and highly praised work of Robert Proctor. Proctor's original research
revealed 'addiction' fighting to be a central project during the Third
Reich. Hitler had his own WOD, it turns out. It is important to understand
the significance of this, and Proctor's highly praised work should be read
by EVERY person with an interest in 'addiction'. (Only for starters, of
course).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intellectuals study important matters. But academics, it seems,
restrict their thinking to what they can sell in the marketplace of ideas.
Shame!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have cited a great deal of polling data to document the Spiritual
Revolution. For a recent summary, see Timothy Jones and George Gallup, Jr.,
2000, <i>The Next American Spirituality: Finding God in the Twenty-First
Century</i>, Chariot Victor Publications.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Spirituality' does NOT mean 'religion'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While Pentecostal, Neo-Pentecostal, Charismatic, and other Christian and
non-Christian religious movements of an 'enthusiastic' variety have been
spreading, there has been a concommitant decline in the mainstream, liberal
faiths. The result is that church and synagogue attendance has not changed
a great deal, though the content of faith and the form of worship has.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To this, though, must be added all the other 'spiritual' movements which
have arisen in recent years.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Especially, the 'spiritual therapy' movement needs to be taken into
account. (This is where AA, the 12-Step Movement, and the treatment
industry fit.) Also, you must count spiritual dietary movements, spiritual
ecology movements, spiritual bodywork movements, spiritual 'animal rights'
movements, spiritual astrology movements, spiritual psychic communication
movements, the new 'spiritual' movement in medicine, the 'spiritual' and
'values' movement in education, and on and on. This stuff is more
widespread than you think - though I agree it tends to be puerile and
jejune.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We even have a new, spiritual politics.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(Have you heard of the 'Faith-Based Initiative'? It is the spiritual
answer to poverty, we are told, and is meant to replace the materialistic
welfare state.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I don't, of course, argue that the Spiritual Revolution has swept over
the entire American population. There are opponents, amongst whom I count
myself.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan and William Bennett all observe, there
is a 'culture war' going on in this country. And that war, they say, will
be to the death. I agree, and I think the battle has hardly been joined.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 'addiction-treatment' movement is part of the culture war. It is a
government-corporate funded propaganda effort, designed to convince
Americans that the malaise in this nation is rooted in INDIVIDUAL impurity,
and not in social and political inequality on a world scale.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the reason ZZZZZZ and his ilk are so well-paid by the big
corporations. They are paid to teach us that the fault lies in ourselves.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the solution is not to be sought in a pill, but in a political
program. Not in dopamine, but in true political and economic democracy.
Democratic politics must be global, it must embrace
ALL people, and it must begin with a massive redistribution of the world's
wealth and power.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Spiritual Revolution in America is what George Mosse calls a
'displaced revolution'. It is a reemergence of the fascist deception.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ZZZZZZ's 'mystical biology', you need to understand, is a form of
spirituality, too. Jonathan Edwards long ago condemned it as the
'physicalist heresy'. More recently, German fascism offered us a 'medical'
road to social recovery:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;There is in truth only one humane idea, that is, 'furthering the good,

strong, good and victorious one and separates the chaff from the wheat. We
simply fulfill the commandment, no less.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This is an important book that will encourage the reader to reflect on
the ways in which medical science was conducted and used in the twentieth
century&quot; (Nature).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Fascinating, substantial.... a major contribution... will
undoubtedly (and deservedly) become a standard item on reading lists of 20th
century history&quot; (P. Fritzsche, American Scientist).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Appears to be a work of public health history but is really much
more.&quot; &quot;Much of what the book reveals may well prove disturbing to many
readers.... All who consider themselves participants in the contemporary
war on cancer had best read this book&quot; (Journal of the American Medical
Association)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;A remarkable study&quot; (M. Jay, London Review of Books)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;pathbreaking and courageous.... an important historiographic
critique.... Proctor challenges readers to contemplate what it means for
fanaticism, crime and callousness to have coexisted with common sense and
rigorous scientific inquiry&quot; (B. McFarland-Ickes, Medical History).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a couple of years now, I have been urging [two people]
to look at historical and comparative materials that raise troubling
questions about modern, state-operated 'purity crusades'.

be a good place to begin consideration of this sort of material.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Our admissions of personal POWERLESSNESS finally turn out to be firm
bedrock upon which happy and personal lives may be built.... Until he so
humbles himself, his sobriety - if any - will be precarious&quot; (12 Steps and

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;This philosophy must be SOLD to every victim.... It must be
accepted UNSTINTINGLY&quot; (Anonymous, 1941, &quot;Ex-Souses Tell of AA,&quot; Milwaukee
Journal, April 30, my emphasis).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As in many states, the AA movement spread into Wisconsin through links
to the elite. In Milwaukee, a local judge adopted AA as a 'project' after
the Rockefeller dinner, and began pushing people into the movement from the
bench. The above article describes the group as having only 20 members in
the entire city in 1941, yet 35 column inches are devoted to this fledging
politico-religious movement! And this was only one article of many to
appear in the major area newspaper during the formation of AA in
southeastern Wisconsin.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is a research project for an enterprising masters candidate.
Every urban locale will have a newspaper record of the first stirrings of
AA. And in every locale, I am sure, the record will show the very same
thing: the movement was introduced from the top down.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Judges, law enforcement officers, prison officials, leaders in the
medical community, prominent businessmen first adopted AA as a project.
Then, they found willing agents in the community, who volunteered to join
the movement, and disseminate its 'program', in return for social and
economic benefits.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In short, right from the beginning, being 'powerless' vis a vis the
elite came packaged with being arrogant and totalitarian in relationships to
those of lower class-standing.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From its very origin, AA worked with
the concept of <i>F&uuml;hrerprinzip</i> &#8212; just as had Buchmanism.

societies. Each claims a certain wisdom concerning the problem it treats.
Each has a specialized system of teachings that members venerate as the

capsule form at the start of each meeting.<br>

The quote's from the first Burton.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
NOBODY is an &quot;alcoholic.&quot; The 'physical disease' that only a 'spiritual
treatment' can successfully address is a politico-religious myth.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Heavy drinking, on the other hand, is a naturalistic conception of a
habitual behavior.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Virtually anyone can develop a heavy drinking
habit, given the right circumstances and the desire to 'escape' from SOCIAL
dis-ease and discomforts. Alcohol impairs cognition, and aids in the task
of psychological repression. Like all psychotropics, alcohol interferes
with higher-order information processing. You do not think straight when
drunk or stoned, contra MXXX's bio-racial myth.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Narcissistic Americans, especially of the lower-middle class, who enter
into
the 'recovery movement' (or into the very similar neo-Pentecostal or
Charismatic
movements, for that matter) often mythologize themselves into 'wounded
healers'. They become modern-day shamans.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is nothing wrong with a lemon. And you don't have to add refined
sugar to it, either, to make it nutritious.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the other hand, there is nothing right about being a drunk.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Being a drunk is immoral. (Though we need to understand that
'immorality' has a SOCIAL locus. We need to blame individual drunks less,
and blame the society which creates the need for 'escape' a lot more.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Liberation theologists have a concept of 'social sin,' which I think has
merit when stripped of its 'spiritual', superstitious connotations.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12-Stepping isn't lemonade. Instead, it is intellectual poison.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An example: 12-Step treatment for 'gambling addiction', a speciality
you are now acquiring under order from the state government.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the government is the biggest PUSHER of gaming in Minnesota!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gaming, pushed and advertised, becomes widespread - and it brings with
it inevitable problems. These problems don't just threaten some class of
'biologically-inferior Untermensch.' In fact, gambling problems emerge
anywhere gambling is pushed, and they emerge through stochastic processes
which operate across the whole population. Some parts of the population,
though, are more targeted by gambling pushers, and are also more susceptible
to their advertising pleas.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gaming is a substitute for the now-dying American Dream. As the economy
has decayed since the early 1970s, real wages have undergone steady erosion.
The hope of improving one's life, and one's family's welfare, have come
under assault.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Government, with its own fiscal crisis to face, has offered the
fraudulent hope of getting rich via gambling. In fact, state lotteries bilk
the poor and lower-middle class - those whose American Dream has been most
damaged - by offering them a substitute: the mirage of getting rich by
gambling. Many are sucked in, and some get into serious economic problems.
Just as with alcohol, widespread use causes inevitable widespread damage.
This damage must be explained away.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Enter the dishonest 12-Step therapist.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is the job of this jackel to explain to the victims how the whole
process is a result of THEIR biological inferiority!!!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This exculpiates the real evil-doers: the greedy and gutless
politicians, the big corporations that diminish hopes and real economic
opportunities by closing factories and demanding tax reduction (while
corruptly enriching themselves), the gaming industry vampires who suck
profit out of the poor and pocket high salaries, the advertising flacks who
dress the whole thing up as a munificent enterprise. And to this list is
rightfully added the cowardly 12-Step therapists, who meekly report on time
to their 'addiction therapy training classes', when Big Brother orders them
to do so. Their job is to 'cool out the marks'. That is, they are to
explain that the problems are all 'in the man, not in the bottle.'
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a lie. The problems associated with mass alcohol use are SOCIAL
in generation, and the problems associated with mass gambling are SOCIAL in
generation.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A REAL 'therapy' for gambling in America would get at the root of the
problem, and attack the corrupt politicians and corporate executives who
promote these scams.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But 12-Step professionals never do this. For them, the 'higher powers'
are sacred authorities, and only the victims are to bear the blame for
social ills.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This kind of dishonesty is not 'lemonade' - it is political poison.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (See Robert Goodman, 1985,
<i>The Luck Business: The Devastating
Consequences and Broken Promises of America's Gambling Explosion</i>, Free
Press, for a good political-economic of who, and why, the deceit of gambling
is being pushed on Americans by their political and corporate leaders).

[To a critic:]
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do you have a citation for your claim that Wilson was 'sequestered
away' at Towns Hospital, and 'allowed only Oxford Group visitors'?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have not read this in any of the secondary accounts.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Towns Hospital did not include Oxford Group indoctrination as part of
its brief drying-out treatment, to the best of my knowledge. In fact,
adapting the 'spiritual treatment' to the 'physical disease' of 'alcoholism'
seems to have been Wilson's own innovation.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, critical researchers are not allowed access to the
archives. Only AA boosters, like Kurtz, have that privilege. So my
knowledge here is necessarily incomplete. If you have discovered evidence
that the Oxford Group program was integrated into the Towns treatment before
Wilson arrived, that would be of the great interest.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think you misunderstand Wilson, though. I don't believe he was ever
'brainwashed' into the Oxford Groups purity cult.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson's contemporary associates in the Oxford Groups consistently said
that Wilson, and Lois, never became 'maximum'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson found the spiritual claptrap of the Oxford Groupers attractive.
But he was attracted to all sorts of other superstitious nonsense during his
lifetime, too, including even contacts with ghosts during s&eacute;ances in his
home! But these attractions to the 'spiritual' did not seem to influence
the corrupt nature of the man.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson remained a vulgar womanizer. He bragged about his adulterous
sexual affairs in very coarse terms, disgusting those around him. He
continued to be a heavy cigarette smoker (the OGs frowned on the habit). He
continued to be dishonest and corrupt in his business affairs, too.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I think we have to conclude that Wilson, while attracted to puerile
superstition and spirituality, manipulated such ideas for his own benefit.
He remained very much an opportunist, who USED the Oxford Groups to promote
his own selfish interests. This is not to say he did not have SOME belief.
But his belief was always shallow. (Think of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, or
Jimmy Swaggart, as comparative types - though Wilson seems to have been even
LESS 'truly committed' to the OGs than these are to Christian
Protestantism.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Wilson sobered up at Towns Hospital on his several visits, he
learned
of Charlie Towns's earlier prominence, and that Towns had run a chain of
profitable hospitals before Prohibition.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FDR and the New Deal had repealed Prohibition. Obviously, some new
means of dealing with drunkeness was going to be required, and this was
being discussed in all the newspapers. Wilson, who had made a living
analyzing businesses and their potential for expansion, could see that an
operation like Town's would benefit from repeal. Just as Towns's business
had been highly successful before Prohibition, so it was likely that a
similar business would succeed after Prohibition.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From his personal experience, Wilson knew that the belladonna, etc.,
treatment offered by Towns was hooey. But then came Ebby, pointing out that
the Oxford Groups already had a very low-cost means of 'curing' drunks, and
that this 'program' was being praised in all the newspapers, and lauded by
the rich and powerful.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson figured that, with Repeal, he could easily raise money to open a
drunk-fighting chain of for-profit hospitals, which would use the Oxford
Group program
instead of Towns's method, in the fight against 'alcoholism'.
And he figured he would become very rich in the process of 'doing good'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We don't have to assume Wilson was totally insincere in his Oxford
Group affilitation. What we do need to do, though, is take the historical
record for what it is.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How can we claim that Wilson was brain-washed, when the Oxford Grouper
themselves say he never really bought their program, was never really
'maximum'.
<p>
He dropped out after only a couple of years. He never reformed his own
'bad habits', from
compulsive adultery to cigarette smoking. In short, there is no real
evidence that shows Wilson to be
a committed true-believer. Instead, he remained a flim-flam man and an
opportunist, with a penchant for superstitious nonsense.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed, when you talk about the people running the big 12-Step
treatment outfits today, this is how you tend to view THEM, as flim-flam men
who try to sell themselves on the product they huckster.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson was like this, too.
<p>

<p>
[to a critic]
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... where in the world do you get the idea that the Oxford
Groupers &quot;selected&quot; Towns Hospital as the facility in which Wilson would
sober up?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This is total nonsense.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson was in Towns Hospital on FOUR occasions, and each stay was brief
(and expensive). The admissions were:
<p>
<pre>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Autumn, 1933
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Late Spring, 1934
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Summer, 1934
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dec., 1934
</pre>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, Wilson had no contact with the Oxford Groups until his friend,
Ebby, stopped by and visited him, and extolled his own 'recovery from
alcoholism' via the Groups. That happened in November, 1934. By then,
Wilson had already been in and out of Towns THREE TIMES.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Towns Hospital was a well-known drying-out tank for wealthy drunks. It
was selected for Wilson by his sister's, Dorothy's, husband: Dr. Leonard
Strong. Strong was an osteopathic physician practicing in the New York
area. Strong also picked up the tab for Bill's four short stays at Towns
(each less than a week, if memory serves).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no evidence that Dr. Strong was an Oxford Grouper.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no evidence that Oxford Groupers had anything to do with
Wilson's four admissions to Towns.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bill's first real exposure to the Oxford Group method came in November
of 1934, via Ebby.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to Silkworth, it would be worth looking into his background.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was a Princeton grad, and you will remember the big controversy at
Princeton over Buchmanism.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Buchman started recruiting on elite east-coast campuses in 1919. He was
on and off the Princeton campus until he got banned, in 1927, for harping on
'sex problems' too much. This did a lot of damage to Buchman's reputation,
and made the scandal columns of a lot of newspapers.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Silkworth had already graduated Princeton by 1919. Still, he must
have know about the Groupers, and about the controversy. Yet, in 1935, he
did not object when Bill embraced the OG method.
<p>
<a name="Rockefeller_05"> </a>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This does NOT, of course, indicate that Silkworth was a Grouper, or
even particularly attracted to the Groups himself. He may have been just an
open-minded doctor, willing to let his patient go in any direction that
seemed to be helpful. Still, there is evidence here of a GENERAL sympathy
to a mixture of spirituality and medicine. And Silkworth had been trained
at Bellvue, where there was a Rockefeller influence. It would be
interesting to know more about Silkworth, his values, and his career.
Probably an M.A. thesis in that.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But we must conclude, I think, that Towns Hospital was not an Oxford
Group facility, that Oxford Groupers never 'selected' Towns as the place
Bill should be treated, and that Bill was not 'oxfordized' at Towns, either.
(Meaning he was never 'brain washed').
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson was an unhappy man, and a business failure. He came up with an
innovative insight at Towns, an insight which mixed doing 'good' with doing
'well.'
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, right from the beginning, Wilson was imagining a chain of FOR
PROFIT hospitals. This was anethema to true Oxford Groupers, who regarded
Wilson and Lois as 'not maximum', and as 'trying to commercialize' their
spiritual movement.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, the Wilsons never were whole-hearted OGs, and they stayed in the
movement less than three years, leaving in the summer of 1937.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Akron crowd was MUCH more OG-oriented than was Wilson. Most of them
did not break with Buchman until fall of 1939. Even then, many participated
in BOTH movements for some further time.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But not Wilson. His devotion to the OG just never ran that deep.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The hospital in Akron you refer to was St. Thomas's Hospital. No, it
did NOT use 'Oxford Group' methods. It was a CATHOLIC hospital, and
Catholic's were not allowed to join the Oxford Groups at that time, under
pain of ex-communication from the church.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sister Ignatia (nee, Della Mary Gavin) was quite a case. She was an
Irish immigrant, and 45 years old when she began to cooperate with Smith in
treating drunks. She herself had suffered a severe mental breakdown a few
years earlier, and appear to have been a VERY superstitious and emotional
woman.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sister Ignatia and a doctor at St. Thomas's, Thomas Scuderi, had been
treating drunks before Smith arrived to request their assistance.
Ironically, part of the treatment they had been employing involved large
doses of morphine! (Which, I guess, just might get you past that desire for
a drink).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, Mary Darrah goes into all this in her book,
<i>Sister Ignatia</i>, 1992, which I assume you have read.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What needs to be understood is that 'spirituality' was in the air
during the Great Depression. It was the solution being offered by all sorts
of groups on the political right, for the 'spiritual' approach blamed the
Great Depression on the flaws of individuals, and NOT on the
politico-economic system.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Catholic reactionaries had come up with their OWN mingling of alcohol
problems with spiritual politics, long before the Oxford Groups existed.
After all, alcohol is a very old political metaphor in the U.S.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take a look at, for example,
Rev. Daniel A. Lord, 1939, <i>I Can Take It
Or Leave It Alone</i>, St. Louis, The Queen's Work.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lord was Father Dowling's supervisor
in St. Louis (Dowling was to become 'Bill's sponsor').
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The St. Louis Jesuits were fighting alcohol abuse in their own
'spiritual way' in the 1920s and 1930s. At this time, they were also
cheering for General Franco's Army in Spain, describing Mussolini as a
friend of the Church, and attacking Cardenas in Mexico for his land-reform
and secular government. Of course, the big devil was the U.S.S.R., while
these Catholic reactionaries tended to excuse the Nazis as bad, but perhaps
necessary to avoid a communist Europe.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your narrow focus on the Oxford Groups alone, the fact that you haven't
even mastered (or at least remembered) the basic AA and OG materials, and
your use of the meretricious 'brain washing' idea leads you to make
everything simple and mechanical.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But history doesn't work that way. The Oxford Groups wasn't an
all-purpose demon, using horrible 'brain washing' methods. There was a LOT
of stuff going on in the 1930s. And, on the political right, that 'stuff'
was SPIRITUAL stuff.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh, by the way, the St. Louis Jesuits, including Dowling, also admired
Father [Charles] Coughlin, the Catholic priest who invented right-wing
hate radio.
(Roosevelt called Coughlin one of the most dangerous men in America,
around the time Dowling was praising him).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A Nazi can be CONSISTENT, but not authentic.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Authenticity means facing external and social reality HONESTLY, to the
best of one's ability. And to act in accord with what one knows.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be a person of 'good faith' does not mean that you have all the
answers. But it does mean trying to understand, including trying to
overcome your OWN little lies and easy escapes. You want to face life. You
want to know the truth. You see what is there, and say what you mean, and
mean what you say.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It helps to work toward 'good faith' with others, and in
criticism-self-criticism, so long as this does not degenerate into a lot of
narcissistic babble. For good faith means DOING what you believe in, too.
You have to put your money - and even more, yourself - where your mouth is.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Look at the life of Malcolm X. Look at his growth. He was open to
knowing, and he was changing radically even the day he was killed. He
didn't have all the answers, and he made some very large mistakes. But he
seems to have been TRYING to be honest. He seems to have been authentic.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nazis did not do this. None of the fascists did, including none of the
American fascists. One reads Hitler's Tabletalk, and one is confronted by
lie after lie, some of which Hitler seems even to have come to believe
himself. The lies are often minor. Little white fibs. It is as if Hitler
had come to be so used to lying, that he could not even describe minor
incidents of his childhood without distorting them. Little men tell little
lies. But little men can do terrible evils.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To be a fascist, one had to WILL to believe lies. For fascism
postulates Supermen and Untermensch. It postulates 'race'. But these are
not concepts that can be held if one is open to the world.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It took no genius to discover that Jews were not sub-humans, in the
Germany of the 1930s. All you had to do was have the guts to talk to one.
The lie of Nazism couldn't last a minute, for any person who honestly
confronted the reality of a living Jew.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nazism was a twisted dream. People CHOSE the dream, over a reality
they feared. This was an inauthentic choice. It was 'bad faith'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Jews are not a mystically 'chosen people', divinely ordained to
take the land of the West Bank from impoverished Palestinians, either, as
the Zionist Right's dream would have it. Sadly, as Martin Buber once
observed, many Jews learned from Hitler only that it is better 'to do it to
the other guy, first'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nor do Americans have any right at all to incomes of $30,000 a year, per
capita, while many Guatemalan peasants starve on 1/100th of that amount.
Any real contact with the poor of the underdeveloped world reveals them to
be FULLY human, and fully deserving of an equal share in the world's
production. (Divided equally, every single person in the world could
receive about $5,000 - plenty to live on.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, DDDDDD earns triple that average figure, or more - and RRRR
probably twice what DDDDDD gets. No wonder they want an unfeeling,
inauthentic, neutral scientism. But this 'science' dances to the tune
played by the government and the big corporations. And it is a science that
mystifies and lies, but ignores the rhinocerus in our living room, our
overriding world reality: SOME STARVE, OTHERS ARE OBESE - AND THIS IS
IMMORAL!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the things Arendt noted about Eichmann was his superficiality.
He seemed to be very emotionally controlled. He did not let himself feel
freely or honestly. He spoke in stereotyped, 'approved' utterances. He was
logical and consistent, if you accepted his premises. But his ideas were
trite, superficial, out of touch with reality.
<p>
Yet, Eichmann seemed 'happy' in his way. The psychiatrist who examined him
described him as having an admirable family life, regular and predictable.
He appeared 'well-adjusted'. He would have made a 'pleasant' neighbor. He
'got along'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arendt labeled this kind of adaptation to the world 'banality'. To be
banal is to live by a superficial code, that limits thoughts and feelings.
To be banal and inauthentic is to stay within what Chomsky calls 'the
boundaries of thinkable thought', while ignoring what Sartre le ve'cu,
'lived experience'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People may seek to conform, to escape from freedom. They may use
powerful chemicals to help them do this. They may even BEG for Prozac or
anti-depressants, when they sense they are getting out of step with the
herd. Many have conformity pushed at them by superior authority.
Heretics are burned at the stake.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Authenticity does not imply consistency. The world is a confusing
jumble, if we are willing to experience it as it is. We struggle to MAKE it
consistent, but as soon as we do this, new contradictions appear. Every
synthesis becomes a thesis, and generates a new antithesis. The process has
no end. Only dogmas have a perfect form. Real human knowledge grows, and
is always imperfect.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Staying rooted in reality, striving to know, allowing ourselves to feel,
is being authentic.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not easy to be human, but humanity is the crown of the universe.
George Gaylord Simpson once remarked that in humanity, the evolutionary
process has become conscious of itself.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is an amazing thing. Humans can consciously know, and we are free,
in a world of determinism.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To seek to escape from that freedom, to turn our backs on consciousness,
is to be inauthentic, to live in bad faith. This is immoral for
human beings. It is a sin, not against gods, but against our own
nature, our own essence.

I don't believe Wilson was ever actually a 'stockbroker'. He was an
investor, a speculator, and a sometimes analyst, but he never had a seat on
the NY Stock Exchange, nor even a New York broker's license.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The issue about Wilson's immoral behavior does not have to do with what
happened when he was a heavy drinker.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It has to do with how he conducted himself AFTER his 'recovery', and
AFTER his founding of AA.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Wilson has been widely portrayed in the media as something akin to a
saint. And AA has offered itself as a program which can turn immoral people
into moral, 'spiritual' actors.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet, the truth is quite different.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Wilson didn't just have one mistress, he was an inveterate womanizer who
bragged about his conquests in vulgar terms for many years after the
founding of AA.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was also a corrupt and dishonest business cheat - a criminal, in
fact. Not in 1934, when he was still a heavy drinker, but in 1939.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wilson was much like Jim Bakker, or Jimmy Swaggart. He was a
charismatic flim-flam man. He probably believed some of the ideas he
floated in the creation of AA, but these ideas did not transform his
character.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jimmy Swaggart probably believes some Christian tenets, too. But it
doesn't stop him from living like a millionaire, and cavorting with
prostitutes, does it?

--------------------
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No comment of mine could be interpreted as 'fascist' by anyone who knows anything about the topic.
Your comment reflects lack of knowledge.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Fascism' - as a generic socio-political phenomenon - can be defined as spiritual, palingenetic,
reactionary-modernism, which has reached the stage of political organization.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Protofascism or pre-facism is spiritual, palingenetic, reactionary-modernism, but BEFORE such a
movement has become politically organized..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Protofascisms have been very diverse during the last 150 years of Western history, eg, Coughlin's
Social Justice movement, the German Wandervogel, various Bundist youth communes in pre-Weimar and Weimar
Germany (which provided a model for the British 'therapeutic community' movement), the Italian Futurists,
the Jesuit 'Social Order' movement, and on and on.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hundreds of protofascist movements have been studied. As both George Orwell and Reinhold Niebuhr
observed in the late 1930s, the AA/Oxford Group movement is also a protofascist formation. The majority
of protofascists formations, it should be noted, never develop into fully-fledged fascism.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protofascisms often claim to be 'apolitical'. This shows their basic distain for the corrupt
parliamentary political haggling one sees in corporate capitalisms. But this 'apolitical' stance, in
fact, is evidence of the revolutionary potential of protofascisms, for apolitical cynicism comes mixed
with spiritual utopianism.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Protofascism and fascism are not found just on the traditionally-defined 'right'. As Sternhell
notes, fascism is 'neither left nor right.' One finds unorthodox 'Marxists', for example, often
in amongst the fascists, eg, Sorel, Mussolini.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For a fuller explanation of fascism, and a more careful statement of the definition given
above, consult works by George Mosse, Stanley Payne, A. James Gregor, Walter Laqueur, Zeev Sternhell,
Mark Neoclaus, Ian Kershaw, Emilio Gentile, Roger Eatwell, Roger Griffin, amongst, of course, many, many
others.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A still useful bibliography is,
P. Rees, 1984, <i>Fascism and Pre-Fascism in Europe, 1890-1945</i>.
Stanley Payne's <i>Fascism: History and Interpretation</i>, 1995,
U. of Wisconsin, also has a very extensive bibliography.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To understand the distinction between the
communist tradition, and the fascist tradition, see,
W.  Laqueur's essay, 1995, <i>&quot;Post-fascism, Post-communism,&quot;</i>
in Partisan Review, July.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
While the communist tradition is quite distinct from the
fascist tradition, all the
'socialisms-in-one-country' so far observed have reverted to state capitalism after only a brief period
of progressive reforms. The difficulty, it seems, lies in the fact that any national state remains
trapped in the world system. Under such conditions, the pigs, as Orwell said, soon take control of the
farm.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If possible at all, then - and history is
for us to make, there are no guarantees about its outcome
- 'communism' would appear to be possible only as a WORLD-WIDE form of social organization.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personally, I am - and have been for 50 years - a materialist, a secularist, a humanist, and an
independent political radical.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I consider myself a 'communist', by which I mean that I support massive economic redistribution and
political change in order to provide the poor of the Third World with a fair and totally equal share
in world production. And I support revolutionary violence, where counter-revolutionary repression makes
radical change impossible by any other means.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I was brought up in a working-class family, and myself worked in factories in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as
a young man. But my already radical political orientation was changed greatly by living and working in
some of the poorest rural regions of Central America.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There, I encountered, and came to respect, hundreds - indeed, thousands - of human beings whose lives
are made miserable by American-sponsored political repression and economic exploitation.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But to say this in the abstract is not the same as being in a dirt-floored hut in the mountains of
Mesoamerica, a 5-hour-walk away from the nearest road, and watching a Mayan mother grieve over the body
of her dead infant son, who had just just succumbed to a starvation-related disease.
<p>
<a name="Guatemalan_killings"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is not the same as interviewing a member of Guatemala's elite Policia Ambulante Militar over a
bottle of rum one night, and being told of how he was trained to kill by American experts in genocide.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (This counter-insurgency fighter told me his American instructor assured the class that there are
times when it is necessary to use torture, to kill women, and even to murder babies. Such acts are
necessary at times, the instructor said, &quot;in order to send a message&quot; (&quot;dejar una promesa,&quot; was the exact
phrase my informant used).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not the same, either, as walking into the plaza of the small pueblo in which you reside, and
observing the machine-gunned bodies of Mayan youths, dumped there by La Mano Blanca (a C.I.A.-assisted
death-squad organization). Then, upon looking into the faces of the corpses, suddenly realizing that you
had been in the hut of one of these young peasants, had talked to him, and had shared a humble plate
of tortillas and beans prepared by his now-widowed wife.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That incident occurred in Chiquimula, Guatemala, in August, of 1973. Those young people were killed
by order of a local wealthy land-owner, who wished to seize control of a tiny patch of sugarcane.
But the U.S., and the local henchmen it supports, have murdered scores of thousands of innocents in
Central America since then.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Even Catholic nuns have been raped and murdered, in order, 'to save civilization', to quote the
words of George W. Bush - himself a coward, and a draft-dodger during the Vietnam era.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The single, most important fact of our time is that the world is divided into an
over-consuming North, and an exploited South.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over-consumption in the West must be reduced, and the resources freed must be redirected to meet
human needs in the poor countries.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If this can not be accomplished peacefully, then it must be accomplished by other means.

[to a critic:]
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You end your precis on Churchill's career by coming to a spurious conclusion about the genesis of his
published work:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Most of it [was] achieved while drunk and very little if any while wholly sober.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You offer not a shred of evidence for this claim. Yet you present it as a fact.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The kind of evidence you need to garner is quotations from contemporary observers of Churchill at
work - family members, house servants, political associates, journalists who might have had the
opportunity to visit Churchill at his home or office, and so on - who gave personal testimony that
Churchill completed his published writings while drunk..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A summary from a respected biographer(s) would support your argument, though it would not be as
convincing as testimony from direct observers.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need to have some sort of working definition for 'drunk'. Let's say it equates, for our purposes,
with the behavioral signs of drunkeness used in a standard roadside test for drunk driving.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Show me the evidence from contemporary observers that Churchill routinely wrote while so inebriated
he could not walk a straight line, or touch his finger to his nose. Indeed, show me ANY evidence that
Churchill routinely wrote while drunk, and that this work was subsequently published to acclaim..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Churchill was a heavy drinker. But, like a lot of heavy drinkers, he seems to have been able to
schedule his intake of alcohol in such a way as to 'manage' the problem. With many such people, daytime
work associates are not even aware that the individual has an alcohol problem, or that he/she routinely
gets drunk in the evening.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You have offered an IDEOLOGICAL argument with no evidence.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ideology you are defending is that of Western consumerism. For you, as for ZZZZZZ, massive
overconsumption - drinking oneself blind-eyed, or, in ZZZZZZ's case, eating himself into obesity - is
natural, unavoidable, ethically-acceptable, and even productive of creativity.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Western consumerism is not natural at all. Instead, it is a product of a specific social and
economic order.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Massive over-consumption in the West is relatively recent, and is the conscious outcome of government
policies aimed at stimulating aggregate effective demand. That is, overconsumption is orchestrated by
government, corporations, and the advertising industries, and is meant to encourage the spending of money
by people who have it. Demand-stimulation came to dominate Western economic policy only in the 1930s.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as the rich West spends, the impoverished of the world must go without. For example, fresh
vegetables, fresh-cut flowers, fresh fish, and prime cuts of beef are now air-lifted from Guatemala into
the American market. The ZZZZZZs of the United States are encouraged to buy these items. But as
ZZZZZZ feeds himself into obesity, the poor in Guatemala die of starvation.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Effective demand is NOT the same as human need. The two concepts are very, very different.
Effective demand can be generated ONLY where money is possessed, and it exists whether the demand is for
items that brings good or ill. One can buy things that hurt.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some well-off Nigerian students, you tell us, believe it natural and good to get drunk, often.
But drunken comportment by some in Nigeria means that grain, which might go to feed hungry Nigerians, is
diverted into the alcohol beverage industry instead. You defend this diversion, but many Nigerians
angrily contest it. This is a battle which, amongst other things, opposes the interests of rich
consumers with poor people..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Consumerism and over-consumption has nothing to do with meeting real human needs. Instead, it has to
do mostly with increasing aggregate effective demand, with stimulating a decrepit and deeply troubled
world capitalist economy.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To understand the problem, we have to escape the mystifying alcohol metaphor.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just as the War On Drugs is not really about drugs, so the debate about drunkeness is not really
about alcohol at all.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alcohol is a metaphor which embodies two contradictory facets, two needs, of advanced corporate
capitalisms:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) the need to prime consumer consumption and increase effective demand, and,
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) the need to control and discipline the mass of the population, and force them to conserve and
save.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced capitalism suffers BOTH from too little consumer demand, AND from a much too low rate
of savings and investment.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the drunkeness debate, one group of ideologues is proclaiming that 'consumption' is the more key
element in Western capitalisms. Such people even laud and/or defend OVER consumption, such as drunkeness
and obesity.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An opposed group of ideologues, who also are defending capitalism, see the problem of controlling
government spending and increasing the savings rate as more critical. They want to cure the poor of
their 'addiction' to welfare programs and to other wasteful behaviors. They want a 'mean and lean'
government and society. That want the masses to abstain from consuming..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But these two groups of opposed ideologues are only touching the capitalist elephant in different
places.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Capitalism needs BOTH vastly expanded consumerism, AND vastly expanded savingings and investment, in
order to correct the very serious problems it now faces.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But, of course, it is impossible to have these two things at one time. One cannot be both drunk with
consumption, and a sober saver, simultaneously.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Western consumerism is morally evil and politically unacceptable. To defend and laud excess - even
to the point of defending drunkeness and obesity - is to defend the ideology of Western over-consumption.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But neither corporate-liberal consumerism, nor protofascist asceticism, is morally acceptable.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We must meet the real needs of flesh-and-blood human beings, and we must do this over the entire
surface of the globe. Each and every person has a moral right to be free from want, and each has an
equal claim on the world's wealth and productivity.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Understanding requires that we see through the myth of 'addiction'.

The Big Book goes into detail on how one needs to apologize to
those harmed, make restitution, establish new relationships with one's
employer, reformulate domestic life (how hypocritical!), and so on.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to drinking, this is quite clearly put in its place:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Our drinking was ONLY A SYMPTOM&quot; (Big Book, p. 64).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, most 12-Steppers today do not have, and have never had, a
drinking problem. Most enter the movement propelled by other problems and
concerns.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And what newcomers seek is what Bill Wilson said they needed: &quot;a
revolutionary change in their way of living and thinking&quot; (Big Book, p. 50).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is for this reason that I include the 12-Step movement within the
much larger 'Spiritual Revolution' now taking place in America.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are right that 1950s style AA strayed less far from 'alcohol
problems' than has the post-1970 12-Step Movement. This is significant. We
need to look at the 12-Step movement, not as having a program set for all
time, but rather as a social movement with a lot of capacity for evolution
and change. It is a very dynamic phenomenon.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As to advertising, you are half-right. Early AA was puffed by the Ivy
Lee firm, and often even the AA members did not know what support they were
getting behind the scenes. The whole Cleveland press campaign, for example,
remains to be explained.
<p>
<a name="Rockefeller_06"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But AA has always cooperated with the press. And Wilson went around
the country on a media trip for AA in the early days, having his picture
taken, giving interviews, and using his full name. It was the Rockefeller
Men who determined this must end, just as it was they who decided 'money
will only spoil this thing'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since the 1980s, AA has accepted public declarations by its members
without chastising the celebrities involved.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AA has never chastised Betty Ford, or describe her headline-seeking
behavior as out of place, for example.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nan Robertson talks about the change in policy in her book. She quotes
Lois Wilson as saying that 'anonymity' was always only a tactical measure,
and was now no longer necessary. Hazelden, of course, URGES its more
well-known clients to go public, 'in order to help those still suffering'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I wish you could step back from your deep emotional commitment to AA.
I don't think unless you can honestly question your own attachment to the
movement, and investigate how this attachment serves you in your own life,
you will ever see clearly on these matters.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am not saying, of course, that I am an unbiased person. I have my
biases, too, and I believe they limit my insights in important areas. I
just don't think my blinders are on when it comes to AA.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The myth of Bill Wilson is very well developed in American culture.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A few years ago, a made-for-TV movie focused upon Wilson's life. It
aped the hagiography AA itself has published, and an even more dishonest
book by an academic hack who gets his royalties from Hazelden.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That movie is now on video/dvd, and can be found in most movie rental
stores in the U.S. My local Blockbuster carries it, for example.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In some treatment facilities, I have been told, clients are instructed
to watch this movie so as 'to give them hope'. At a local community
college, which offers paraprofessional training in 'addiction counselling',
the movie is shown to some introductory classes, in conjunction with
lectures on 12-Step treatment and voluntary groups.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Popular myths of this sort are important. And, when the myths are
lies, and are dangerous, exposing them is important, too.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Noam Chomsky has remarked that 'the new mandarins' of American academia
never question the myths of the powerful. To do so would annoy those who
pay them.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is willed ignorance.

[To a critic:]
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is one key question, and we need to keep the focus on it:
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Are 'alcohol and drug problems' really a major and serious threat to
the social well-being of Western societies?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Have 'alcohol and drug problems' been massively inflated,
exaggerated, and loaded with emotion for POLITICAL reasons?&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You say alcohol and drug problems are real. (The first President Bush,
asked to name three major problems facing the U.S., responded, &quot;Drugs, drugs
and drugs.&quot;)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I disagree with you, and Bush, senior.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say alcohol and drug problems, as they have been presented, are
largely unreal. These 'problems' are myths and POLITICAL SYMBOLS. They
have been used to fuel a vast moral panic, a symbolic crusade. Many on the
right (eg, Szasz, Peele), and many on the left (Breggin, Chomsky) agree with
me.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I want to expose the myths, and dig into the roots of this widespread
moral panic. I want to understand why this vast social deception and
propaganda effort is taking place. I want to look at the issue
comparatively and historically.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You, on the other hand, do funded research on alcohol and drug problems,
assuming the myths to be real, e.g. the 'vast threat' of drunk driving..
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, I am quite aware you tweak the 'addiction' concept a bit. That is
hardly important. There were major differences between German biologists,
and Italian political scientists, too, over how social 'degeneration'
develops.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Germans tended to think in medical, biological, genetic, and
neurological terms. They thought the problems were caused by the physical
organism, the brain, and the 'blood'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Italians, like Giovanni Gentile, the Minister of Education and a highly
respected international intellectual in the 1920s, scoffed at the Germans.
Degenerates were not biologically different, he said. They were merely the
products of bad cultural upbringing. They could be changed by government
action, and by educational reform. Your thought is more like this.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These debates were acrimonious, and the disagreement sometimes quite
significant.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still, these two streams of quite different thought both formed part of
the protofascist-fascist tradition.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This tradition leads to a misplaced revolution. It does this by
focusing on INDIVIDUAL problems, and not SOCIAL contradictions.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead of changing society to meet the needs of men and women,
displaced revolutions seek to change men and women in order to save a
failing socio-economic system. This is what 'spiritual revolution' is all
about.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It matters greatly where you see the crux of the problem: in the PERSON,
or in the SYSTEM.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You see 'alcohol and drug problems' as manifesting themselves in the
individual, though, like Giovanni Gentile, you believe government can
intervene and chastise, or educate, individuals to do better. You see, for
example, the flaw as mostly in the individual drivers.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I say this is nonsense. You must go to the root of the problem. And
the root of the problems facing Western societies has to do with vast,
systemic contradictions that are simply hidden from view by the 'alcohol and
drug' mythology. I am unwilling to exaggerate the role of 'drunk driving';
I insist that the entire locational-transport system must be the focus.
<p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On political philosophy, suffice here to say that individual freedom
vs. system influence is not so nettled a problem as you think. The key is
to give up the idea of social CAUSES, and switch to the idea of social
CONSTRAINTS.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Constraint' here is used the way the concept is applied in
mathematics, or in dynamic systems engineering.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The river is CONSTRAINED by the banks, but it moves according to fluid
dynamics within those boundary conditions.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An animal is free to move within its cage, but the cage bars CONSTRAIN
its movement.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Michael Polanyi notes, constraints can be INTERNAL. A gasoline
engine, for example, routes and channels the flow of energy through itself.
The design of the engine's structure are 'control constraints' which guide
the energy, allowing useful work to be done.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Internal constraints or 'boundary conditions' can be symbolic, instead
of material. A gas engine routes energy through its material constraint
structure. But a computer program routes information by reference to
information-constraints, ie, program rules.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Linguists distinguish 'grammar' from 'speech'. Grammar is the set of
rules that constrain what you say. You are free to utter an unlimited, and
wholly unpredictable, number of sentences. But only grammatical utterances
will be understood. (Note for those with no linguistic training, 'grammar'
to the linguist does NOT mean PRESCRIPTIVE 'grammar', ala the grammarian.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speech acts form an unlimited, but bounded or constrained, set. You are
free to say more things than the universe has atoms (many more, actually),
but only if you stay within the boundary conditions can you communicate.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, in our behavior, we are also free, but constrained. We are
constrained by internalized rules of moral behavior that exist in our heads.
We create these rules, just as we each create the grammar which guides our
speech acts.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We use social input to help us create our individual behavioral
constraint rules, but we each are able to test and challenge and reformulate
these constraints, too, when contradictions arise.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is in this constant process of real living, of information exchange,
of creativity, and, sometimes, of willed repression, that a human life is
lived. (And not 'determined' by our dopamine level!)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are BOTH free, AND constrained. But - and this is a big 'but' - we
are always able to revise our constraint system. We can change our moral
outlook, our code of ethics, our 'program for action'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When crisis arises, when contradiction leads us into 'fear and
trembling', we overthrow the rules in our minds and think in new ways. We
are 'converted' to a new 'program for living'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Saul becomes Paul.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The process, and the informational dynamics that underlie it, can be
theorized without the problems you think might be necessary. In fact,
Chomsky, and others, have already done this.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As to what will happen 'after the revolution', I have no idea. Anyway,
I don't have so many years of life left. I criticize what I see as
dishonest and false today. I leave it for the young to build the future.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, it doesn't bother me that my left critique sometimes resembles
the critiques of those on the libertarian right. Remember, it was the
conservatives who made the only real attempts to assassinate Hitler.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; goes an Arab saying. And
Churchill once remarked that he would join forces with the devil himself, to
beat the Nazis. If Churchill could ally with the U.S.S.R., and vice versa,
then I should not be embarassed to quote Szasz from time to time.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The state's special role comes from the fact that it defines itself in
terms of 'exclusive use of legitimate force.'
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bribes are somewhat more effective than force. But globally, states
are facing fiscal crises. The welfare-state's bribery simply is no longer a
viable option.
Everywhere, welfare states are collapsing.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, across the globe, we see a shift to coercive techniques of social
control - including coerced indoctrination. Can this be reversed?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Orwell longed for a world of equality, justice and brotherhood. But,
disappointed in his mature years, he grew pessimistic.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In Orwell's novel, 1984, Winston is interrogated by the state's
inquisitor.
Winston tells the inquisitor that he disobeyed the rules because he wanted
to bring about a better
future.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The inquisitor laughs:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Future?!&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The future,&quot; says the inquisitor, &quot;is a boot stomping down on a human
face... forever.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like Orwell, I hope for a better, and more equal, world. But I am
afraid humanity could face the boot in the face, forever.

[to another critic:]
<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;War brought the feds to Berkeley, just as it did to Ann Arbor. And
the Cold War kept them there. The enormous expenditure on defense
technology of the 1950s and 1960s bred a near-dependence on Uncle Sam....
By 1964, 58 percent of the University of California's research expenditures
came from federal grants, contracts, and appropriations, [and] research
money wasn't the half of it.&quot;
<br>
Elliot, Michael, 1996,
<i>The Day Before Yesterday: Reconsidering America's Past,
Recovering the Present</i>. NY: Simon and Schuster, p. 129-130.
</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was located across the Bay in the 1960s, but got over to Berkeley
from time to time. Berkeley 'New Left' grad students were, overwhelmingly,
phony draft-dodgers. Loud-mouthed, middle-class phonies. Today, they hold
comfortable corporate and government jobs. Their Strurm und Drang was moral
hypocrisy.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whatever income you enjoyed as a student in the 60s, you were amongst
a privileged elite of the young people in the U.S. at that time. Any
student at an elite university was. Anyway, the paychecks started coming
soon enough, no?
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People in the developed countries believe, overwhelmingly, that they
have a moral RIGHT to live in obese luxury, while billions of human beings
live in unspeakable misery, and starve on incomes of $500 a YEAR, or less.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But there is no such moral right, and no such 'biological
imperative'. The ZZZZZZs of the United States can eat themselves into
obesity, while Guatemalans starve, only because of POWER.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And 'objective' scientists, such as yourself, earn incomes of $100,000
a year, or more, while Guatemalans sweat to earn $200 or $300, for the same
reason: POWER.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This unjust MATERIAL disparity is historical, and is maintained by
FORCE.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As we slip into deepening global economic crisis, a great escalation
of force will be needed to maintain the economic disparity between rich and
the poor.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And force always requires its justifying myths.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, the myth of 'addiction' has been created. The goal is to make
the many - both domestically and internationally - 'powerless', while
putting control of a new world economy in the hands of 'higher powers'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The myth of 'addiction' has not been created out of whole cloth. Its
cultural roots are to be found in the 'spiritual diseases' invented in an
earlier era. The evidence is clear on this, and it exists in many, many
works of unquestioned scholarly competence - works that people like ZZZZZZ
have sworn never to read. (&quot;I am not now, and I have never been, one who
will question the underlying corporate-government 'addiction' myth.&quot;).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps, as you point out, not even three guys could be found in the
United States who would agree with my views.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (While traveling and living in Latin America over the years, I have
made contact with a great many who DO share my general perspective, as do
most of the 40,000 armed 'enemy' that the U.S. Drug War now combats in
Colombia. But Latin Americans tend to think differently about such issues
from North Americans - or from Swedes.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am unconcerned by this lack of popularity of my opinions in the
U.S., or on Addict-L.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have no intention of 'selling' my opinions in the 'marketplace of
ideas'. Hence, I have no need to cut my conscience to fit this year's
Berkeley fashions. I can call them like I see them, and speak the truth
about power.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst others, DXXXXXX has suggested
that 'spirituality' may
be defined without positing any 'spiritual' ontological reality.
That is, 'spirituality' may be conceived of in PSYCHOLOGICAL
terms.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But a word has to be taken to mean what
speakers of a language
SAY it means. We have to accept the definition of 'spirituality'
in the U.S. that Americans give to that word.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A national representative survey by the
Gallup organization
throws light on these matters (G. Gallup, Jr. and Timothy Jones,
2000, <i>The Next American Spirituality</i>, Colorado Springs: Victor).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gallup's polling data shows a culture change
of 'seismic proportions' (p. 25).<br>
&quot;Never in recent memory has spirituality
seemed so much on people's minds&quot; (p. 14).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The nation now sees itself, Gallup says, &quot;battered by a crisis
not so much of politics or education as of soul&quot; (p. 18).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Respondents who say they feel a need for 'spiritual growth'
surged in the late 1990s, up 24 points in just 4 years, to 80%.
For the first time in history, 'ethics, morality and family values'
are now the NUMBER ONE concern expressed by Americans (with the
crimes of the immoral running a close second). Material factors
fall far behind on the list. (p. 31)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Deep worries about alcohol, drugs and child abuse have fueled
this moral revolution, says Gallup (p. 32). A feature of this
Spiritual Revolution is a deep cynicism about 'politics as usual';
people feel 'betrayed by politicians' (p. 32). Are the times ripe
for a great 'spiritual leader', who will transform and purify the
American political system. Not yet, perhaps.... but wait.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;When addictions leave people feeling helpless,&quot; Gallup
remarks, &quot;it is no accident they turn to a Higher Power&quot; (p. 35)
But POLITICAL helplessness in the face of economic collapse and the
new 'terror' threat, may lead to a search for a political Higher
Power, too.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When asked what 'spirituality' meant, 2/3s referred
explicitly to a supernatural 'other' - most of them to the
Judeo-Christian God. (But, of these, over 20% also believed in
astrology, and over 28% in reincarnation). (Pps. 49, 58).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of the third who stated that 'spirituality' was 'internal',
many expressed gnostic beliefs, such as a belief in 'a god within',
a 'divine spark in all of us', and so on. The idea of spirituality
is virutally never expressed in terms of MATERIALISTIC concepts
drawn from psychology; there is virtually always a mystical,
occultic component to this concept. (p. 49).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Over 40% of Americans now participate in small groups of some
sort, and the majority say that one reason for participation is the
'solace of a healing environment'. 2/3s of respondents said they
had prayed in the last 24-hours.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
72% of Americans said 'spirituality' was NOT primarily to be
found in organized religion. (p. 50).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Americans are a deeply unhappy people. The American Index of
Social Health, which has tracked expressed well-being for 25 years,
has fallen an amazing 52% from the level it enjoyed in 1973. (p.
69).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
47% of Americans now describe themselves as 'born-again' or
evangelical Christians; this figure has been exploding in recent
decades. (p. 80).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If spiritual explanations and scientific explanations
contradict each other, 62 % of Americans say they prefer spiritual
explanations. (p. 82).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When Americans pray, 95% pray to a supreme spiritual being.
Only 2% pray to a cosmic force, the inner self, or a god within -
more evidence that Americans DO see 'spirituality' as entailing a
ontological spiritual realm (p. 83).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Many Americans decry the &quot;soul-deadening malaise of
materialism,&quot; says Gallup (p. 91).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An amazing 16 % of respondents say that they felt very lonely
in the last 24-hours!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
22% say they feel despair!
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
61% say that religion can solve all, or most, problems in the
United States.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(all in the Index tabulation of survey responses)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Gallup quotes Martin Marty, who remarks:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;... spirituality increasingly finds its home in management seminars and corporate policy
and practice.&quot; (p. 74).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In fact, it has been a massive government- and
corporate-sponsored Symbolic Crusade, I would argue, that has
shaped popular opinion in this way.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
People like ZZZZZZ argue that the War On Drugs has failed.
Hardly. The War On Drugs has created a phantom evil, and a
'spiritual' solution for that evil. The War On Drugs, and the
'addiction' myth, has been one of the prime movers in shaping the
Spiritual Revolution in America.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is exceedingly odd to read about the history of 'weakness of the
will', and 'loss of self control', in the 19th and early 20th centuries,
with the focus placed very narrowly upon DRINKING behavior, and drinking
behavior only.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the most commonly diagnosed medical diseases of the 19th
century, for example, was 'neurasthenia' (Gr., 'neuron', nerve + 'asthenia',
lacking power). The condition was diagnosed by alienists ('mad-doctors',
psychiatrists), neurologists, family practitioners, and others. The
assumption was that observed behavioral deviancies - from insanity, to
insomnia, to dipsomania - eminated from organic defects in the brain, or in
the vast network of nerves branching from it. A primary result was weakness
of the will.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A plethora of causes were thought to contribute to neurasthenia.
Amongst these were a whole range of 'poisons' - in foods, in drugs, in
beverage
alcohol (if taken in excess, or, for some, if taken at all), in the
environment, etc. Poisons were thought to damage 'nervous tissue',
initiating a vicious cycle. Thus, once suffered, neurasthenia
showed itself as a 'weakness of the will', amongst other symptoms. But,
with will so weakened, the individual had less power to avoid exposure
to poisons in the future. To take alcohol consumption as an example,
drinking could 'poison' nerve tissue, weaken the will, and thus make future
drinking episodes even
more likely and more problematic.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Poisons', however, were never viewed as the only cause of
neurasthenia, nor was alcohol ever considered the only 'nerve poison'.
Some behaviors - like masturbation - were also thought to have a damaging
effect
on nervous tissue. And some environments were viewed as hazardous for the
human
nervous system. Urban living, for example, due to a whole range of factors,
was thought to impact nervous tissue in a highly detrimental way. This
seemed to
account for the crime and social deviancy associated with city life.
Heredity was also thought to contribute to cases of
neurasthenia.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An American physician, George M. Beard, was one of the most tireless
publicists of 'neurasthenia' in the 19th century, but the 'disease' became
central to medical
thinking on both sides of the Atlantic.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another, related condition drew even greater attention as the century
wore on. This was 'degeneration', &quot;one of the most important generic
clinical diseases of the nineteenth century&quot;
(S. Gilman, 1985, &quot;Political Theory and Degeneration,&quot; in
<i>Degeneration: The Dark Side of Progress</i>.
Ed. by J. Chamberlin and S. Gilman, Columbia U. Press, p. 165).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In effect, 'neurasthenia' came to be subsumed as an early, and
INDIVIDUAL, manifestation of 'degeneration', which was then conceived of as
a broader, overall affliction, progressive in nature, which effected not
just individuals, but hereditary lineages, social groups, and even entire
nations.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A French psychiatrist, Benedict-Augustin Morel, published the first
medical text on 'degeneration' in 1857 (the same year, significantly, in
which Baudelaire published Les Fleurs du mal). &quot;Much of the book centers on
what Morel called intoxicants and allied products, and these discussions
have a strong chemical tinge.... Alcoholism received the main attention&quot;
(E. Carlson, 1985, &quot;Medicine and Degeneration,&quot; in Chamberlin and Gilman, p.
121).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Morel was a Lamarckian, and his formulation of 'degeneracy' emphasized
environmental factors. As with neurasthenia, we find 'poisons' listed as
causal agents. But exposure to alcohol, opium, hashish, and tobacco could,
Morel thought, damage not only nerve tissue, but the 'reproductive fluids',
too. Hence, 'degeneracy' would 'progress' and worsen, not only in the
individual, but in whole lineages, ever worsening if not corrected.
Degeneracy, Morel thought, was a 'family disease'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only psychoactive substances caused degeneracy, in Morel's view.
Some minerals were nerve and reproductive-fluid poisons, too (lead, copper,
phosphorus, mercury, arsenic). Also, some physical environments had a
deleterious impact on the human organism (marshlands, hot climates), which
explained, among other things, the degenerated state of the negro race. And
some social environments caused degeneration (eg, cities, isolated rural
regions), leading to the degradation of the proletariat, and the
backwardness of the peasantry.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Diets based on 'degraded' foods could cause degeneracy (eg, ergotism).
Other diseases and injuries might cause damage to the nerve and reproductive
tissues, leading to the condition. And some behaviors could degenerate the
nervous and reproductive tissue (eg, sexual impurity).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Alcoholic excess was thus considered one - but ONLY one - important
cause/symptom of degeneracy:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Dipsomania became a popular term in the nineteenth century and
illustrated the spreading view that drunkeness was not wilful, but an
illness, a particular form of mania.... Morel considered alcoholism a
degenerative state and many who came after him agreed&quot; (Carlson, op cit, p.
130).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beard, Morel, and other early theorists of neurasthenia and degeneracy
worried about the impact these diseases had on the social body, but they
remained confident that medical and public-health measures could arrest the
maladies. But, as the 19th century wore on, hopes for 'progress' dimmed,
and, concommitantly, medical visions took a darker turn.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 19th century in Europe can be classified into two, very broad
periods. The first half of the century was marked by unprecedented economic
growth, beginning in England but then spreading to the continent. However,
in the 1840s, a confusing pause to growth occurred, a pause that was
accompanied by ever-increasing signs of social turmoil and urban
restiveness. Growth then resumed briefly in the 1850s. But, soon, came
the so-called Great Depression of the Victorian Era, initiating &quot;slow growth
and even deceleration from the 1870s to 1913&quot;
(F. Crouzet, 1982, <i>The Victorian Economy</i>, Columbia U. Press, p. 53).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moreover, even as many economies stumbled in the second half of the
19th century, the European bourgeoisie was shocked by violent episodes of
resistance from the 'underclasses', both domestic and foreign (eg, the Paris
Commune, the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857, etc.). The stumbling economy, and
the rise of 'terrorism' at home and abroad, shook to its foundations
bourgeois confidence in Inevitable Progress. Now, it seemed, history could
move downward, too, into the mire and muck of a 'degenerate condition'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Eugene Talbot's
<i>Degeneracy: Its Causes, Signs, and Results</i> (1898, London, Walter Cott)
became paradigmatic for this more hopeless vision of
the medical condition of society which was embraced at the end of the
Victorian Era. Not Lamarckian enviromentalism, now, but Social Darwinistic
'racial science' undergirded the idea. Nancy Stepan (1985, &quot;Races and
Proper Places,&quot; in Chamberlin and Gilman, p. 112-113) puts it this way:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;In Talbot's formula, even an apparently healthy and wholesome
individual could be harboring, unknowingly, a degenerate condition.
Degeneracy in this sense was a pervasive, social decay of the individual and
the group... Talbot himself expressed some concern that no discipline or
reform could eliminate the congenital criminal class, the sexual perverts,
or the constitutional prostitutes. The Lamarckian model of biological and
social inheritance, which allowed for the environmental reform of individual
heredity, was beginning to lose favor.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This same pessimism permeated the work of
William Hirsch (1896, <i>Genius and Degeneration: A Psychological Study</i>,
NY, Appleton), and that of the
enormously influential German-Jewish physician, Max Nordau (1896,
<i>Degeneration</i>):
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; George Mosse remarks, regarding Nordau:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Nordau was a doctor and looked at the
challenges to contemporary
society through a physician's eyes.... Nordau voiced a majority opinion
when he saw degeneration exemplified by the cities and their industrial
proletariat.... The conflict... at the fin de siecle was conceived as
a struggle to preserve society's norms and thus to protect the normal
against the abnormal.... The term degeneration had been coined in 1857
in order to characterize those whose nerves had been shattered by poison
like alcohol and opium, through inherited bodily malfunctions, but also by
their social milieu and moral debility.&quot;
(G. Mosse, 1993, &quot;Max Nordau,&quot; in
<i>Confronting the Nation</i>, U. Press of New England, p. 162 ff.,
see also J.  Oppenheim's excellent,
<i>Shattered Nerves: Doctors, Patients, and Depression in Victorian England</i>,
1991, Oxford, esp. the chapter on 'Nervous Degeneration').
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For the disease of degeneration, Nordau believed that &quot;police action
would do no good, nor the threats of the philistines; presumbably only true
personal regeneration would help&quot; (Mosse, op cit).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is highly ironic, as Mosse notes, the a liberal, German-Jewish
physician, Nordau, became one of the most influential proselytizers of
neo-fascist ideas at the end of the 19th century. For Nordau argued that
degeneration was a physical disease for which only a 'spiritual treatment'
would suffice. For Jews, whom Nordau believed suffered more than others
from
a weakness of will, physical exercise, spiritual discipline,
healthy diet, and escape from urban living were all essential. Nordau
became an exponent of Zionism, and of a New Jew, to be created in a new,
rural Israel. &quot;A new type of Jew must be created,&quot; Mosse tells us Nordau
believed, &quot;who could end the threat of decadence among the Jews.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But 'spiritual recovery' from neurasthenia and degeneracy did not come
first and foremost amongst Jews. Instead, 'spiritual recovery' from
'degeneration' was most forcefully advanced in the early 19th century by
protofascists and fascists in France, Italy and Germany. In was here that
'spiritual recovery' from materialism, individualism, and degenerate
behavior was first accomplished by joining together in spiritual fellowship,
bound one to another by irrational myth. Degeneracy was cured by a Triumph
of the Will.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sorel, in Reflections on Violence, argued that personal recovery and
national salvation could only be accomplished through an irrational,
spiritual, and total dedication to the group and its myths - a dedication
that would inevitably lead to violence, combat, and conquest by the
'spiritually superior'. Nietzsche, too,
saw the Ubermensch arising, like a phoenix, out of the ashes of degenerate
society, powered by complete dedication to mythic belief. Arthur de
Gobineau also
argued that group loyalty must come before individual calculation, if
degeneration was to be overcome. Gogineau added that the health of the many
might require that the 'diseased' perish:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Societies perish because they are degenerate.... The word
degenerate, when applied to a people, means (as it ought to mean) that the
people has no longer the same intrinsic value as it had before&quot;
(1915, <i>The Inequality of Human Races</i>, p. 24).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The degenerate can infect the healthy, not only through biological,
but also through cultural, pollution. The healthy have a right to protect
themselves through vigorous public health policies. This might include
interning the polluted in a domestic context, or even invading a foreign
source of international pollution. &quot;Racism, Fascism and Nazism would carry
degeneracy theory
into the twentieth century&quot; (S. Gilman, op cit, p. 190).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (It is of interest that the U.S. has invaded Colombia, claiming as
justification a need to clean that nation of drug pollution. Recently, too,
Attorney General Ashcroft has apparently raised the prospect of
concentration camps for American citizens who qualify as 'enemy combatants'.
No trial would be required, nor even a formal charge; mere government
accusation would suffice for indefinite internment. It may take until after
the next - and, I surmise, worse - 'terrorist incident', but I believe such
a system of internal concentration camps is inevitable for the United States
in the not-distant future).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For several decades after WW II, Americans bathed in the luxury of
progress and affluence. But the economic crisis of the early
1970s initiated a long-term secular decline in the global economy. For over
three decades now, the world has been trapped in a sickening malaise.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many Americans simply do not realize - or do not care - to what degree
the third world has
suffered economic per-capita decline in recent years. Instead of
understanding the horrendous conditions that now prevail over much of the
globe, creating hundreds of millions of desperate people, the comfortable
bourgeoisie of
the industrialized countries prefers to see the rest of humanity as
'diseased'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today's 'alcoholism' and 'addiction' - and you can add 'terrorism' to
the list, though the medicalization of this concept is not yet complete -
are reformulations of older ideas, like 'neurasthenia' and 'degeneracy'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, like those older ideas, these concepts, too, are generative
metaphors used, not to explain, but to deceive. The 'War on
Drugs/Terrorism' hides from us the material realities which underlie present
day conflicts. And these have very little to do with 'drugs' or
'terrorism'.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Addiction' professionals are not paid by common people. Instead, they
are paid by governments and corporations (often to do things TO common
people).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hence, 'addiction' professionals have little interest in the economic
struggles of the common person. Instead, like ZZZZZZ,
most 'addiction' professionals embrace economic Pollyanna-myths. America,
and the world, they say, is filled with opportunity, and things are getting
better. (Ergo, 'addicts' do not HAVE problems, they ARE the problem.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By subscribing to reactionary economic myths, ZZZZZZ and
other 'addiction' professionals reveal themselves as ideologues,
uninterested in empirical fact.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will continue posting some fundamental facts about the long-term
economic crisis, in the U.S. and in the world. My goal is to contrast
economic FACTS with the mythology of the 'addiction' reactionaries.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A useful, well-documented source is
Jeffrey Madrick, 1995,
<i>The End of Affluence: The Causes and Consequences of America's
Economic Dilemma</i>, Random House.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madrick's perspective on the American economy is historically deep.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Economic historians believe that, even by the middle colonial period,
per capita incomes in North America exceeded those of England. By the time
of the Revolutionary War, for example, revolutionary soldiers averaged
several inches taller than their English counterparts, due to the better
diets made possible on American incomes. From a whole variety of sources,
economic historians calculate that North America has, for centuries, been
especially economically blessed.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Madrick notes several reasons for the superior performance of the
American economy. First, the U.S. enjoyed a rich resource base, including
a vast continental expanse of land (after dispossessing Native Americans
and Mexico).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Second, as the American population moved west, the world's largest free-
trade zone was created. This generated enormous domestic aggregate
demand. Aggregate demand grew apace with the astounding population
increase and territorial spread of the American nation.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Third, before the Civil War, America's internal market, with its huge
aggregate demand, was protected by oceans and distance (ie, transport
costs) from foreign competition. Post-bellum, as transport costs began to
come down rapidly, the U.S. instituted a very high protective tariff.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth, the population flow westward, and the massive increase in
aggregate demand through time, fomented a chronic labor shortage at the
same time as it promised significant profit to new production.
Entrepreneurs responded to high demand in an environment of tight labor
supply with large capital investments, and with openness to technological
improvements. Yankees gained a reputation, worldwide, as 'practical
minded', 'profit oriented', 'technologically innovative', even crassly
materialistic. Yankees were 'can do'. And the American economy DID do,
for several hundred years.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the 1900s, for example, real wages rose by about 1% per year over the
entire century, a pattern which continued and accelerated for the first two-
thirds of the 20th century. These real wage increases were based on a
remarkably consistent long-term expansion of the GDP.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Only in the late 1960s/early 1970s did the economy falter. Thus:
&quot;[There has been] a sharp slowdown in economic growth from our
historical average of about 3.4% a year, and often higher, since the Civil
War to little more than 2 percent a year since 1973.&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (The growth spurt at the end of the 1990s did not change this pattern,
since the 1990s opened with a recession, and the U.S. was again in
recession in 2000.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Some reactionaries, like Jimmy Carter in his famous 'malaise' speech,
have argued that the immediate post-WW II decades were unusual, and that
those economic good times were bound to pass. Americans must now accept
inevitable 'reality', they say, and adapt to an Age of Declining
Expectations.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the 1948-1973 period produced real growth of just under 4% per
year. Since 1820, the American economy averaged real growth of around
3.7%. And in the 1870-1910 period, growth was around 4% per year, above
that of the 1948-1973 period.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hence, &quot;It was not the first two post-World War II decades, then, that
were especially unusual compared with our historical record, it was the two
decades of slow growth that began in 1973.&quot; (p. 13.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Symptoms of economic difficulty begin to appear even before the growth
slowdown, ie, by the Kennedy recession of the early 1960s, and slow growth
has continued up to the present - diener).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is involved here is a fundamental, PLANNED restructuring of the
American political economy, not an 'inevitable' economic slowdown.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After WW II, the U.S. became the center of a FREE WORLD EMPIRE, a vast
political-economic unit that embraced more than half the globe. American
corporate and government leaders began to think in terms of IMPERIAL
interests, and not just in terms of American domestic interests. Hence,
capital investment flowed out of the domestic U.S., to less stable, low-
wage parts of the empire. These areas were also given free access to the
American domestic market. This helped stabilize politically unstable
regions of the empire. It also helped earn profits for international
corporations.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as the rate of capital investment in the U.S. fell, and imports
surged, two predictable results followed:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Productivity growth in the U.S. slowed. Faltering domestic
productivity reflects the decimation of the U.S. industrial base, which in
turn results from declining capital investment (7-8% of GDP in the 1950s;
under 3% of GDP by early 1990s, p. 80).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scarce resources are invested in OTHER regions of the New World
Order, where the higher powers believe they are more needed to promote
imperial stability, and also where they often earn better profits.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Imports surged as America's domestic industrial base withered and
as wages fell, but as consumer demand fell less quickly.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From the 1890s through the early 1960s, the U.S. enjoyed a constant
trade surplus. After WW II, the U.S. was the world's largest creditor
nation. It is now the world's largest debtor nation, by far.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The change began around 1970, when the U.S.
began to run ever-increasing trade deficits. The merchandise trade
deficit grew from $1.5 billion in 1971, to $30 billion in 1978,
to $150 billion in 1987, to more than double that number by the
mid-1990s (p. 70-71).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This pattern continues, and shows no sign
of abating &#8212; though, of course, eventually credit WILL run out.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The inevitable result of all these
cumulative economic trends has been
an on-going collapse in American living standards. For this collapse,
there are no answers: it WILL continue, and accelerate.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The U.S. resource base (eg, oil) no longer provides for American
needs. And the contained domestic market U.S. producers once enjoyed is
gone forever: the New World Order is here to stay.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The result has been economic misery, which will only get worse.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For example, looking at the 25-35 year-old age-cohort, we note that
this group was earning a full 25% LESS in real wages in the early 1990s
than the same cohort earned in the early 1970s (p. 135). On average, real,
non-supervisory wages overall have fallen only a bit less than 1% per year
now for over three decades. Minorities and low-income groups have been hit
particularly hard. This has never happened before in America.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Americans are taught hard work brings material reward. But American
lives show this is not true. Average Americans are raised on the American
Dream, but many live an American Nightmare:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The results are repeated disappointment in our personal lives, waning
confidence in long-standing institutions, and rising cynicism in our public
life....&quot; (p. 4).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reactionaries, like ZZZZZZ - who often hold equities in international
corporations - deny the economic crisis that impacts less fortunate
citizens.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ZZZZZZ offers what Madrick calls a 'fantasy of political escapism'.
That is, ZZZZZZ suggests that if 'addicts' just enter 'recovery', then
economic benefits are easy at hand.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;[T]he belief that all we have to do is behave morally,&quot; says Madrick,
describing these myths. &quot;Such nonsense reflects the ambitions of cynical
and timid politicians afraid to tell the truth and the wishful thinking of
a fearful, angry electorate&quot; (p. 156).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;As our old values have become increasingly undependable, many
Americans have looked elsewhere for stable ground: personal fitness,
psychotherapies of various sorts, exotic religions... &quot; (p. 130).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ZZZZZZ's 'addiction' mythology, with its bio-racist assumptions, is a
particularly nasty version of a psychotherapeutic 'exotic religion'. There
is no such thing as 'addiction' - though ZZZZZZ tells us even 'unemployment
addiction' exists, and that the unemployed are 'addicts' who could
be 'treated' for their 'disease'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Instead, people face REAL problems, which are rooted in the real facts
of economic, social, and political life.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Addiction' mythology cannot solve real problems. But it can deflect
anger, away from the elites who fund 'addiction' research, and onto the
persons who get labeled 'addicts'.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The pattern has been seen before, and the historical origin of
the 'addiction' myth is clear enough (though intellectual and cultural
evidence is another body of data ZZZZZZ brags he will totally avoid, along
with basic economic research).
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Modern, medicalized 'purity crusades' have often emerged as elements
in 'reactionary revolutions'. This is the case in America today.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have two pieces of data for you which relate to AA's origins.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) As you know, a book that was read, and much admired, by virtually
all the early AAs was the 'spiritual' bestseller,
<i>The Fool Hath Said</i>, 1936, by Mr. Beverley Nichols.
Bill Wilson's copy of this book is still in the
library at Stepping Stones, or so I have read.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nichols was associated with Buchman's Oxford Group, as were, in
1936, Wilson, Smith, and many others of those who LATER formed AA. (NOT in
1935! That date is a lie.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The interesting point, though, is that Beverley Nichols was
associated with ANOTHER group at this very same time.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the mid-1930s, Nichols was collaborating with Sir Oswald
Mosley, and his British Union of Fascists. Around the time he wrote
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Beverly_Nichols1">his 'spiritual' best-seller</a>,
so beloved by the early A.A.'s, Nichols was
writing other 'spiritual' pieces - which were published in the B.U.F.
press. (This would make a wonderful M.S. thesis topic, if we actually had
academics with any guts - which, sadly, we do not.)
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The source for this information is:<br>
Collins, Tony, 2000,
&quot;Return to Manhood: The Cult of Masculinity and the British Union
of Fascists,&quot; in
<i>Superman Supreme: Fascist Body as Political Icon - Global Fascism</i>.
Ed. by J. A. Mangan. London &amp; Portland, OR. p. 149.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) There is another interesting piece of
information in the same article.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you know, Dick B., in his
<i>Design For Living: The Oxford Group's
Contribution to Early AA</i> (2nd Ed, 1999), provides overwhelming
proof of the immense role Oxford Group ideas, methods, and strategies
played in early
AA. It is not too extreme to say AA was an outgrowth of the OG, a small
sectarian splinter group that began to form between 1937 (when the New
Yorkers left the OG) and late 1939 (when most, but not all, of the
Akronites left the OG).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1936, though, those who would later found AA were virtually all
Oxford Groupers. Like many other OGs, they had a special interest in
alcohol problems.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And, in 1936, too, the leader of the Oxford Groups gave a press
interview, in which he said that 'Adolf Hitler was sent by God to save the
world from communism.' (Bill Wilson, by best evidence, was present at the
press conference, and was certainly an OG member, when Buchman praised
Hitler. Wilson did not leave the groups at that time, and he never
criticized this remark by Buchman, so far as I know).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, many have discounted this comment by the OG leader in 1936. They
claim Buchman just made a slip of the tongue, didn't really mean it, was
naive, etc.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Oxford Groupers were NOT naive about fascism. Buchman himself had
been visiting NSDAP members, and fellow-travellers, in Bavaria, since the
early 1920s, as Garth Lean's biography of Buchman shows.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The above you already know. (I recounted it for those on this
service who might not know these facts). But here is a piece of evidence
that may be new to you.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You will remember that Peter Howard was Buchman's long-time, younger
assistant. After Buchman's death, it was Howard who took over the OG, by
then re-named Moral Re-Armament.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Howard was an upper-class Englishman, Oxford University graduate, and
an Oxford and all-England rugby captain. Naturally, Howard was drawn to
Buchman and his movement, for he was deeply enamored of spirituality....
AND fascism.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Howard served under Oswald Mosley in the early 1930s, when Mosley was
organizing his New Youth Movement (sort of an imitation of the
HitlerJugend). Howard rose to secretary of the NYM.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the the Great Depression deepened, the conflict between fascists
and workers turned violent. It was Howard who played a key role in
organizing the 'Defense Force', a group of young toughs who protected
Mosley at his public speeches. (The model, it seems, might have been the
S.S. in Germany, which protected Hitler at HIS speeches).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1931, Howard, the rough-and-ready rugby player who idolized BOTH
Buchman and Mosley for their 'spiritual' programs, was in the middle of a
violent brawl in Birmingham. While defending Mosley and other British
Union of Fascist leaders, Howard had his temple badly lacerated.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This information is on p. 156 of the Collins article.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are several other articles in this book you would benefit from
reading. Especially the one on China. (Hong, Fan, <i>&quot;Blue Shirts,
Nationalists, and Nationalism: Fascism in 1930s China&quot;</i>).

<p>
<a name="purity3"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hong remarks that the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek used &quot;male
bodies as political metaphors symbolizing and ensuring a strong state.&quot; In
1934, Chiang launched a vast social reform movement, one he labeled
the 'New Life Movement'. It's goal was to 'spiritually purify' the Chinese
population, and amongst its targets were the 'diseases' of 'impurity', like
tobacco use, alcohol drinking, out-of-wedlock sex, etc.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chiang at this time was getting military assistance from Germany, and
a substantial German military mission was in China. Chiang had long been
an admirer of German fascism. And he admired, too, the Germans' War
On 'Addictive Diseases', a topic so well-discussed by Robert Proctor.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like XXXXX, Chiang conceived of social problems as public
health problems and 'diseases'. And - like early AA, Mosley's BUF, and the
NSDAP in Germany - Chiang thought that a SPIRITUAL treatment was needed for
these maladies.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hong quotes Chiang's own words. Here is one sample:

<p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Can Fascism save China? We answer: Yes! Fascism is what China now
most needs. At the present stage of China's critical situation, Fascism is
a wonderful MEDICINE exactly suited to China, and the only tonic that can
save it.&quot; (p. 207 in Hong, my emphasis).
</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is my belief that researching the interconnections between today's
symbolic crusade for bodily purity, and the history of world-wide
protofascist and fascist movements, is a vital task.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The money-grubbers getting rich off the AA-treatment hustle, of
course, have fought that kind of investigation tooth-and-claw.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They don't want anyone looking their gift horse in the mouth.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
ZZZZZZ bleats the right-wing line: Reaganomics worked!
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A REAL economist - Lester Thurow, at M.I.T., and one of the nation's
premier economists - has a very different opinion. the following comes
from Thurow's, The Future of Capitalism, 1996, NY, Wm. Morrow and Co.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;In the decade of the 1960s the world economy grew at the rate of 5.0
percent per year after correcting for inflation. In the 1970s, growth
dropped to 3.6 percent per year. In the 1980s there was a further
deceleration to 2.8 percent per year, and in the first half of the 1990s
the world could manage a growth of just 2.0 percent per year. In two
decades capitalism lost 60 percent of its momentum.&quot; (p. 1, data on this
topic are collected and collated by the IMF and World Bank)

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [note, since 1995, when Thurow's data for this book ends, things have
gotten worse. The Japanese recession has deepened, and both the U.S. and
Europe are now in recession. Latin America is currently in very deep
crisis, eg, Argentina, Brazil. Things are worse in other places, too.
More on the current situation later - diener]

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;... suddenly, in 1968, much like a sudden surge in a long-immobile
glacier, inequality [in the U.S.] started to rise. By the early 1990s the
share of wealth held by the top 1 percent of the population (more than 40
percent) was essentially double what it had been in the mid-1970s and was
back to where it had been before the introduction of progressive taxation.&quot;
(p. 21-22]

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [note, the Bush tax cut for the rich will
greatly worsen this disparity - diener]

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;By the end of 1994 real [non-supervisory] wages were back to where they
had been in the late 1950s. With current trends, by the turn of the
century real wages will be below where they were in 1950. Half a century
with no real-wage gains for the average non-supervisory worker. IT HAS
NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE IN AMERICA.&quot; (P. 24).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [note, wages did not fall as fast as Thurow thought they might. We
fell to the 1950 level only this year, and not in 2000 - diener].

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This post is long enough. I will cite a few more snippets from Thurow
in another post, before moving on to other economists, and to raw data from
U.S. and World Bank sources.

[to another person]
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I do not believe you, or anyone, has a moral right to be 'naive' about
politics. 'No man is an island, separate unto himself. Each is a part of
the main.' You have an obligation to understand politics, and political
history. ESPECIALLY, you have an obligation to learn about early AA's
close ties to fascism, and how cultural movements of bodily purity in
general tend to feed into the fascist project.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I won't get into Afghanistan. Too complicated, and I am no expert.
But, yes, Afghanistan DOES have to be understood in world-system,
historical terms. (You DO know who funded and armed the Muslim extremists
in Afghanistan, and thus put the Taliban in power, do you not? Hint: the
same people who sent anthrax, arms and much money to Saddam Hussein a few
years ago.)

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the wonderful nature of the capitalist economic miracle, see my
posts on economics, labeled, 'contra-the-idiot/econ'.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Regarding revisionism and China.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a very serious topic, and a very great danger. My position is
the one Orwell held. I deplore the fact that the pigs take over the farm,
once the animals make a revolution. I have not discussed the topic in this
forum only because it does not directly relate to America's Purity
Crusade. But China is a great tragedy and a great danger.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I much admire Joan Hinton, who has now lived in China for some 50
years, and speaks fluent Mandarin.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hinton is the grand-daughter of the inventor of Boolean algebra. The
family was working class, but made up of brilliant minds. Joan ended up
getting a Ph.D. in physics, was recognized as extremely gifted, and was
touted by Fermi as a future Noble winner. She was invited to work on the
atomic project under Oppenheimer, to which she made important
contributions. She was then invited to continue that work, by helping to
develop the H-bomb.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the U.S. dropped the bombs on Japan. And then McCarthyism and the
Cold War began. Hinton was disgusted. Her brother was doing research in
China (he later wrote a classic ethnography of a Chinese commune), and he
wrote to her to say that the communists were fighting for worker equality.
She gave up her career in physics, and went off to participate in the
Chinese Revolution! (What a woman!)

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She made, and is still making, an important contribution to China's
poor. She has become a world-class expert in the management and breeding
of dairy cattle, adapting dairy stock to fit the Chinese situation. Now in
her last years, she and her husband run a dairy farm some 50 miles from
Beijing. They are tolerated by - but NOT loved - by China's current
rulers. But the poor Chinese who work on the farm love the Hintons. It is
run as a communist commune.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Interviewed lately by NPR, Hinton said bluntly, &quot;The Chinese revolution
has failed; capitalists have regained control of the country.&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She points to mass poverty in China today - which was absent in the
Maoist era. She believes the Cultural Revolution was basically correct,
though there were serious excesses, too. She notes that today's economic
gains are built on an infrastructure ALL Chinese fought and struggled to
construct. But the rich are reaping the profits now, while millions of
poor are starving.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was it all a failure, a waste?

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No, says Hinton. Poor and working people will have to fight MANY times
to gain a just and egalitarian world. Stalinism in the U.S.S.R., and now
China today, show us that the rich and powerful may be knocked down, but,
like an experienced boxer, they take an '8 count', and return to the fray.
The rich won the round in the former U.S.S.R., and they are winning the
round in China, too.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the fight goes on, says Joan Hinton.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Spartacus and his slave revolt failed, and slavery lasted another 2,000
years. Indeed, there is STILL slavery in the world. But Spartacus was
right to fight injustice. It is better to die on your feet, than live on
your knees.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Personally, I am a weaker personality than Joan Hinton. Weaker, too,
than comrades I know in Latin America. One advantage of traveling a lot is
that I get the chance to interact with others who are better than I, and
who stiffen my sometimes too-weak spine. Solidarity makes us strong, and
the fight WILL go on.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bush will get no easy victory, in his Hitlerite attempt to re-
colonialize the world.

<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
ZZZZZZ has stated that economic trends over the last 50
years &quot;have been mostly positive.&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is wrong.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The issue is crucial. REAL material and practical problems generate
social dis-ease, and it is social dis-ease that underlies 'addictions'.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here are a few more points made by Lester Thurow, nationally-prominent
economist at M.I.T.:

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) &quot;In the decade of the 1980s, all of the earnings gains went to the
top 20 percent of the workforce and an amazing 64% accrued to the top 1
percent.&quot; (p. 2)

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) The social welfare state, in both the U.S. and Europe, &quot;has
essentially gone broke.&quot; (p. 5)

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Thurow notes the U.S. has been running massive trade deficits for
some time. [I will post the raw data later]. In some years, $400 BILLION
dollars in imports have been 'charged', i.e., foreign firms take and hold
U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. corporate bonds, or U.S. currency, etc., in
exchange for goods they export to the U.S.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thurow asks, &quot;When the lending to America stops, and it will stop,
what happens to current world trade flows?&quot; There is no other market that
can sop up the massive surplus in world productive capacity that now
exists. Yet,

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;No one can run a large deficit forever.... The question is
not whether an [economic] earthquake will occur. It will. The only
question is when.... &quot; (p. 196).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Meanwhile, average Americans watch their wages fall, their
government services evaporate, and the nation's infra-structure decay
around them.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Until the early 1970s a truly global economy did not exist and
unskilled Americans were awarded a wage premium simply because they were
Americans.&quot; (p. 78).

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This has stopped. Average Americans - and especially minority and
poor Americans - are no longer needed. They are not needed in factories.
Many factories have moved overseas. They are not needed in the U.S.
military in mass numbers. The U.S. military is smaller, more high-tech,
and voluntary-mercenary now. Moreover, much of the cannon-fodder that
protects GLOBAL capital is recruited in the countries where that capital is
located, e.g., the Colombian Army guards the U.S.-owned oil pipelines in
Colombia.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The average American is, simply, surplus labor, and, as such, is no
longer needed nor respected. Global capital sees him as unnecessary,
selfish, weak. The unemployed, ZZZZZZ has said, are 'addicted' to not
working. THEY are the problem.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;You are 'addicted' to a decent salary, you ass. Shut your mouth,
and pee in this cup!&quot;

[to a critic:]

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That you are 'proud' to be in on the War Against
Drugs/'Addiction'/Terrorism - along with others who post on Addict-L - is
hardly surprising. You earn your living off the 'addiction' myth.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Many German biologists lamented the 'stupidity' of the crude Nazi
politicians - even as they accepted government money to work on the 'race'
problem.)

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please, don't BS us about how independent your clinic is from
government.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is a total crap, and you know it. That you would say such a
thing demonstrates you are dishonest. As you well know, if the government
and corporations did not FORCE 'addiction' indoctrination on people, and if
the elite had not created and hyped an 'addiction' moral panic in America,
there would BE no clinics such as the one you work in. How many such
clinics existed, for example, in 1960 - before the 'conservative
revolution'? Basically, NONE.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had the U.S. government continued to pursue a 'welfare state' strategy
towards 'managing the poor', you and your type would now be mouthing
corporate-liberal baloney, instead of the 'addiction'-myth baloney that you
actually do mouth. If the Great Society still were intact, you and your
type would be picking up a paycheck for helping to distribute food stamps
and AFDC checks, instead of indoctrinating people with the 'addiction' myth.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the War On Poverty gave way to the War On Drugs. This was a major
STRATEGIC change on the part of America's elite, which faced an economic
crisis in the early Nixon years. When you suck up to [Congressman] Hatch, you are
sucking up to a voice that has long been heard, arguing that
a 'conservative revolution' in America is necessary.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The 'conservative revolution' introduced a new method of dealing with
the mass of Americans. The elite shifted from corporate-liberal bribery,
to a strategy of discipline and indoctrination. Hence, poverty programs
declined, wages fell, prisons blossomed, and phonies like you changed your
mantra. The 'mechanical materialism' of welfare bribery fell out of
fashion, and the Age of Spiritual Recovery was born. Jobs opened up for
charlatans like you.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have never said ALL those who monitor Addict-L are corrupt. (I would
not waste time posting here if I thought this to be true.) Especially, NON-
professionals monitor this site. I spend a bit of time each week providing
a critical voice, so that the kind of bull you guys serve up does not go
without refutation. Research shows that even one voice of dissent can
greatly decrease the effectiveness of propaganda.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I do not even claim that all the 'addiction' hacks are CONSCIOUS
evil-doers. People have a remarkable ability to do evil deeds, yet see
themselves as moral and heroic. (Even Eichmann thought he had offered
humanity a difficult, but necessary, medical service, that he had helped
eliminate a deadly, inherited brain disorder: 'Jewish materialism').

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Addiction' hacks limit facts, impose speech codes, get court orders to
push occultic myth on others, etc. But they often act in totalitarian ways
while BELIEVING themselves to be doing the 'higher powers' spiritual work.
One even finds 'admirable' types, at the PERSONAL level, amongst this evil
crew:

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;In most cases, evil is a cultural phenomenon., It results from the
breakdown of tradition. Often it is the most intelligent, most honest, and
most brave who go astray under such circumstances.&quot;<br>
