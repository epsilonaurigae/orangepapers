orange,
<p>
what is your take on the symbolism of the triangle on the coin? You
realize that its very occultic? Do you think Bill W. or Frank Buchman
were  Freemasons?<br>
<p>

Hi JT,
<p>
I suspect that Bill Wilson was just being a copycat.
He and Dr. Bob were (or had been) members of the Oxford Group,
which was very occult and superstitious, so Bill
wanted a symbol for A.A. that looked mystical. So what did he borrow from?
The pyramid and eye in a circle on the dollar bill.

<p>
I've been asked several times
(like
<a href="orange-letters127.html#Mason4" target="newwin37">here</a>),
if Bill was a Mason, and I haven't seen even a shred of evidence,
or hint, that he was. And nobody has sent anything in.
<p>
Frank Buchman is another question. I haven't thought about that before.
I also doubt it, but it bears checking out. I can see how membership
in a secret white boys' society could have
helped him in networking with millionaires.
But then again, Frank may have considered himself above that kind of thing. He wouldn't
go join somebody else's organization; he would demand that they come and
join his society, where he was the leader.
I don't think that Frank Buchman's narcissistic ego could have long tolerated being
a low-ranking member of somebody else's organization.

Have a good day.

Hello,

<p>
I just found your website as I was coming back from an AA meeting
where we discussed Step 6, and I was trying to figure out what Defects
of Character were, so I searched Google for &quot;Defects of Character&quot;.

<p>
I read your pages much like a child who finds a banned book might,
reading hesitantly at first, worried that I was fooling myself and
looking for an excuse to not &quot;work my steps&quot;. I've been sober now for
almost a year and find I am happy to be free from alcohol and
marijuana. I read your pages more and more enthusiastically at the end
and I am grateful to you for having published them on the Web. It is
very refreshing to see the facts about AA and its founders. Though I
agree with what you've disclosed, I don't plan on using this as an
excuse to undo all the good that going to AA meetings has done for me
over the past several months, but I will definitely consider what you
have posted. I agree with much of what you've written and found myself
laughing at times (you have a good sense of humour).

<p>
I thank you for maintaining this website and hope this message finds
you in good health and in good spirits.

Hi Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks and the compliments.
<p>
I especially liked the line about,
<font color="black">
&quot;I don't plan on using this as an excuse to undo all the good...&quot;</font>
[that <i>you</i> have done].
I agree totally. I occasionally say that &quot;I am abstaining from both alcohol and
A.A.&quot;
The fact that A.A. may be screwed up is no reason for us to wreck our health.
A.A. is completely irrelevant when I consider the fact that alcohol is poisonous
to me, and I'm so much better off without it.
<p>
And of course the same goes for tobacco and other drugs, too.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
I am a former heroin addict and general substance abuser.  Back when I
was using, I got high every single day on anything I could get high on.
When it was in full swing, my heroin habit topped a hundred dollars a
day (and that was in 1983 dollars).  I never went into rehab, detox, or
a 12-step program.  I never even tried methadone.  After years of
shooting dope, I just got tired of it and stopped.  It's been almost 20
years now since I used heroin, or any other drug stronger than
marijuana.  Yes, I still smoke pot... but only on rare, isolated
occasions.  I also drink beer and whiskey, but more for the taste than
anything else.  I insist on good microbrews and single-malt scotches
from Scotland (my favorite is Laphroaig) and turn my nose up at swill
like Budweiser, Miller, Coors, etc. even if it's free.  It's entirely
typical of me to go without a drink for a month or two at a time, then
have one or at most two pints of some interesting microbrew, and if I'm
really celebrating, maybe sip on a shot of good scotch for half an hour
to forty-five minutes, savoring the taste.  The last time I got drunk
was almost six years ago, and that was a special occasion.  I remember
at the time thinking how odd it was that I was drunk, since it was the
first time in years.

<p>
Recently an old friend took me to a 12-step meeting, and I was
appalled at what went on there.  I'm only a neophyte at the AA-bashing
business, so there won't be any surprises here for an old hand like
yourself, but I thought you might enjoy the write-up I did of my visit
to the strange unreal world of 12-step.  Here's what I wrote:

<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

&quot;You're so stupid,&quot; said Humann, &quot;you're gonna buy me a steak dinner.&quot;

<p>
&quot;You're so stupid,&quot; I replied, &quot;I'm gonna buy you a raw fish dinner, and
you're gonna eat it.&quot;

<p>
And so it came to pass. The two of us went to a sushi restaurant, and
the dumb son of a bitch gorged himself on uncooked penguin chow on my
dime... and how did he repay me? He took me to an AA meeting.

<p>
Bastard.

<p>
It was a late-night affair, held in a tiny Hollywood playhouse called
the Next Stage Theater, on La Brea just north of Sunset Blvd. The
turnout, I was told several times by several attendees, was unusually
light due to it being the night before Easter Sunday (I guess Lindsay
Lohan had eggs to dye). I helped myself to coffee from the urn outside
the door, dropped a buck in the hat when they passed it, and settled in
to listen and observe.

<p>
The guest speaker was a slender, older black man who climbed up on the
stage and recited a tired-sounding litany of his sin and degradation in
the clutches of demon tequila. An occasional half-hearted whoop of
encouragement or agreement came from the audience, startlingly loud in
contrast to the quiet, almost hypnotic monotone in which he spoke.

<p>
Some of what he said seemed a little preemptively defensive, all of it
regarding God and/or the AA concept of a &quot;higher power.&quot; Several details
of the room's minimal decor had caught my eye, including the phrase &quot;God
loves you&quot; on the meeting's main piece of signage. Two large posters
hung crookedly on the upstage walls,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731063946/http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=67292131389&amp;h=5bb21f3fb75ca1cc58f554149fe06139&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oc-aa.org%2F1212.htm" target="newwin12">
one with the 12 Steps</a>
printed on it, and the other with
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731063946/http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=67292131389&amp;h=5bb21f3fb75ca1cc58f554149fe06139&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oc-aa.org%2F1212.htm" target="newwin13">
the 12 Traditions</a>.
Of the 12 Steps, five mention God by name, a sixth mentions the &quot;higher
power,&quot; and a seventh refers to the AA experience as a &quot;spiritual
awakening.&quot; Of the Traditions, number two on the list designates &quot;a
loving God&quot; as the group's &quot;one ultimate authority.&quot;

<p>
These churchly features of AA must generate friction with stubbornly
atheist or agnostic recruits with great regularity, as our speaker spent
several minutes obliquely defending them without having been challenged
on any of them. He stressed the idea that the &quot;higher power&quot; can be
anything more powerful than you are, and gave the ocean and electricity
as examples. This was nonsensical enough by itself, but he went on to
compound the WTFitude of his statements by saying that you could have a
doorknob as your higher power if you liked.

<p>
During the break, I spoke with him about all this and tried to get him
to clarify a bit. How, I wondered, could a doorknob be more powerful
than you? I can see how the ocean, or electricity, could be seen as more
powerful than a person, but a doorknob?

<p>
What kind of power are we talking about, anyway? The ocean is
undoubtedly more physically powerful than a human being, but can the
ocean write a sonnet, lead a revolution, or travel to the Moon?
'Powerful' is too vague, relative and arbitrary a term... and how does
sheer dumb unknowing physical power render the ocean loving? How can
(and why should) people willingly abdicate responsibility for their
lives and their addictions to an object, no matter how much brute
kinetic force it possesses?

<p>
The specific mentions of God, I told him, were something I simply
couldn't choke down. If AA is sincere about God being &quot;as we understand
Him&quot; then we are still left with two immutable qualities that the AA God
has: 'He' is male, and He exists. I don't buy that, I said, and frankly,
if I were given some kind of hard evidence that a God exists who created
this world and all that is in it, my immediate and heartfelt reaction
would be a resounding cry of &quot;FUCK YOU, GOD!&quot;

<p>
Why is spirituality and religious belief considered a necessary
component of recovery from addiction? Clearly, despite all the
rhetorical dodges used by AA to qualify their statements about God and
submission to Him codified in their Steps and Traditions, what we're
dealing with here is a church. Why are our courts ordering people to
attend church? Wouldn't there be some kind of concern and even outcry if
judges were sentencing people like my friend Humann to attend
Scientology meetings, or Catholic mass?

<p>
Taking another tack, I told him that my personal experience has been
that not only can you stop being an addict (AA says that once you're an
addict, you're an addict for life), but you can do it entirely without
the 12 Steps. I did. I haven't had a needle full of heroin in my arm for
almost twenty years now, and while it wasn't easy and the cravings
lasted for most of a decade, I have in the intervening years moved
beyond all that. My desire to shoot dope remains as an intellectual
memory alone, the visceral memory having long since faded away to nothing.

<p>
I told him that I thought he and his AA friends were selling themselves
short. You don't clean yourself up and stay that way without wanting to,
and no program or set of steps is going to do that for you if you aren't
ready and aren't willing. Boozers and dope fiends who quit because they
think they should rather than because they want to nearly always relapse
eventually. Overcoming addiction simply is not an externally-actuated
process. If you've been clean for a week or six months or twenty years,
I told him, then that's something YOU did, and it's OK for you to own
that and be proud of it.

<p>
He listened to my objections, observations, and questions about AA
dogma, nodding his head and furrowing his brow as though concentrating
on what I was saying. When I finished and was obviously waiting for some
sort of response, he continued nodding for another long moment, then
seemed to be distracted by an invisible fly that drew his darting gaze
away from me and towards the door... the door, his escape hatch back
into the warm safety blanket confines of his idiotic, hypocritical
faith. I felt as though I had suddenly turned invisible and inaudible as
he fled back into the theater without a single word.

<p>
The second half of the meeting consisted of testimonials from the
audience. Two or three broken, sad-faced derelicts rambled pointlessly
about the awful things addiction had inflicted on them, then spoke
without a trace of irony about how God had waved his magic dick and made
it all better. One even mentioned Jesus by name, without a hint of shock
or protest from the rest of the crowd.

<p>
The bottom line is that it's a church. It's a cult. The Steps and
Traditions are carefully structured to destroy the ego, induce feelings
of powerlessness, and keep people in the group, thinking the groupthink
and spouting the group dogma, at any cost.

<p>
I could take the easy way out and simply end this little diatribe with a
big hearty &quot;fuck AA&quot; and be done with it, but I know that the response
from many who read this will be something along the lines of &quot;well, if
it helps people stay clean, it's a good thing, right?&quot;

<p>
I have two responses to that: First, NO, it's not necessarily a good
thing even if it does help people stay clean. The phrase &quot;by any means
necessary&quot; is a noxious one to me and should be to any reasonable
person. I would rather ruin my entire life carousing my ass off, even to
the point of partying myself straight into prison or an early grave,
than join any cult and have my courage and my confidence surgically
removed, my ego crushed and recast in the group's mold. Substitute the
word 'Scientology' for 'AA' and see if you still think it's such a good
thing just by virtue of helping people overcome their drug and alcohol
addictions.

<p>
Second, according to AA's own statistics, it DOESN'T help people stay
clean. I have already mentioned what I intuitively and experientially
know about addiction recovery not being an externally-actuated process;
you have to truly want to stop. You have to be ready and willing, and
you have to take charge of yourself and take responsibility for what you
are doing every waking moment. Statistics show that only 3% to 5% of
those who try to stop drinking and/or drugging outside of 12-Step
programs succeed, and this reflects the fact that most people who try to
quit are doing it because they think they should, not because they
actually want to. If AA was truly an effective program, the recovery
rate of their members would be significantly higher than that 5%.
Instead, according to their own records, the long-term recovery rate of
the 12-Step faithful is... 3% to 5%. Their pamphlets gloss this fact
over by showing only statistics on the people who stay, so when they
trumpet the fact that 48% of their members have been clean for five
years or more, what they're saying is that 48% //of 3% to 5% who try
their program have been clean for more than five years. That's less than
1.5% to 2.5% who stay clean for five years or more... and at what cost?

<p>
AA doesn't work any better than any other approach that people take to
getting and staying clean. What it does remarkably well is suck people
into a set of faith-based beliefs, shove a big steaming God-turd down
their throats, and forcibly remove their dignity along with any possible
belief in themselves and their own strengths. AA sacrifices its members'
self-confidence on the altar of Bill W. as a means of keeping them in
the group //by any means necessary.

<p>
At the end of the meeting last night, Humann got his 90-day chip,
indicating that he hasn't indulged in three months now. Screw the chip;
fuck AA and their precious Steps and Traditions; Bill W. and all his
friends can go sleep on a bed made of dicks... but congratulations to
Humann on his fortitude and resolve in making it 90 days without
poisoning himself any further. AA didn't do that, and neither did God,
or the ocean, or electricity, or a doorknob. Humann did that, and as far
as I'm concerned nobody gets to take a single shred of credit for it but
him. Good job, my old friend. If you ever need to talk yourself down off
the ceiling of your urges, I'm here for you and you know how to reach me.

<p>
Not long ago, I joined Facebook, and old friends from the L.A. and San
Francisco punk rock scene started coming out of the woodwork.  People I
hadn't heard from in years or decades have been turning out in droves.
It was wonderful!  But then I discovered that about 85% of them are now
12-steppers.  I'm shocked, appalled, incensed, and all fired up to do
something about it.  My wife and I are getting ready to move to
Michigan, and I have some professional videographer friends there who
have agreed to help me make a documentary about AA.  It was in the
course of doing some research for this project that I found your
website.  What an amazingly comprehensive mountain of data you have put
together!  I've been reading your stuff at every available moment for
most of a week now, and I would love to use your site as source
material, if you don't object.  Naturally I will also be looking
elsewhere for source material, and plan on filming interviews with
medical professionals, addicts, former addicts, etc. as well as
surreptitiously making audio recordings of 12-step meetings.  I don't
know if my documentary will go anywhere, but I have to try.  It breaks
my heart and inflames my mind that so many of my old friends have been
suckered into this shitty cult, and I have to do what I can.  In my
wildest dreams, I manage to make a film that deprograms thousands of AA
victims, and convinces the State and the Feds to stop ordering people
into the cult.  Eh, in reality I'll be lucky if a hundred people see the
damned thing, but I'm going to make it anyway.

<p>
So A.A. destroys their self-confidence and self-respect, and makes them afraid of having any.
And I know that
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="newwin14">those constant put-downs</a>
really are harmful to a lot of people.
<p>
By the way, if we aren't supposed to take pride in our sobriety, why do A.A. members
proudly walk to the front of the room to accept another sobriety coin, while the
crowd claps and cheers for them, and congratulates them for their hard work?
<p>
But then it's a major sin if you are proud of your accomplishment:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Congratulations on your 90 days of sobriety.
That is great. You have done some good work.
Oh, and quit being so proud of yourself, you egotist.
God is due the credit, not you. You are sinful and selfish and dishonest and manipulative
and just want your own way... You should do another Fifth Step.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That back-and-forth <i>&quot;build them up, then put them down&quot;</i> routine
is called &quot;battering&quot;, and it's just like wife-battering:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First, the husband is friendly and loving, but then he turns on his
wife and threatens and beats her.
<li> Just when the wife is ready to leave, the battering
husband reverts to being loving and reassuring, telling the wife that
things will be better in the future and that he didn't really mean it
and he loves her.
<li> Then, when the wife stays, the husband soon reverts to attacking
and beating her again.
<li> Then, just when the wife is ready to leave, the battering
husband reverts to being loving and reassuring again.
<li> Eventually, the battered wife is so paralyzed by confusion and
fear that she doesn't know if she is coming or going.
<li> And worse yet, while all of that is going on, the husband convinces
the wife that it is her fault &#8212; that her bad behavior is the problem.
She starts to think: &quot;Maybe if I was a better wife, he wouldn't
get so angry. I must try harder to be a good wife and please him.&quot;
Thus, he gradually destroys what little self-respect and self-confidence
the wife has left, which makes it even harder for her to leave him.
</ol>
<p>
A.A. does the same thing: First you are wonderful because you are sober,
and then you are disgusting because you are proud and selfish and self-seeking.
Then you are wonderful because you are working a strong program, and then
you are despicable because you have done so many wrong things, and you have
so many moral shortcomings and defects of character. Then you are lovable because you are
<i>one of us</i>, &quot;The Friends of Bill&quot;; and then you are a social pariah
because you &quot;took your will back&quot;, and &quot;tried to do it your own way.&quot;

<p>
<a name="Hassan"> </a>
And it isn't just A.A. that does that battering routine. Steven Hassan wrote about how
Rev. Sun Myung Moon (leader of the Unification Church, i.e.,
&quot;the Moonies&quot;) did it to him.
Moon would play the role of the charismatic charmer,
lavishly praising his followers in public, honoring them for all of
their hard and faithful work, and then Moon would take them to his
palatial estate, where he would switch personalities, and play the
role of judge and executioner, attacking and denouncing those same
followers for not working hard enough.


<p>
And this:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;When I finished and was obviously waiting for some sort of response, ...
he fled back into the theater without a single word.&quot;<br>
</font>
... reminded me of Scientology:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
'If the criticism cannot be silenced, then the scientologist should cease
all communication with the critic, or &quot;disconnect&quot;.'<br>
</font>
Yep, turn off the receiver and run away. Don't allow any contradictory information
to lodge between the ears. (I described that process in
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="newwin12">the web page on
Propaganda Techniques</a>.)

<p>
You asked:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;What kind of power are we talking about, anyway? The ocean is
undoubtedly more physically powerful than a human being, but can the
ocean write a sonnet, lead a revolution, or travel to the Moon?&quot;
</font>
<br>
Yes. Undoubtedly, the ocean is big and powerful enough for a gigantic wave to knock
me down and drown me, or even drown hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia,
but does that make the ocean a wise and caring recovery counselor who can and should
seize control of someone's life and will, and force them to get clean and sober?
(Oh, and holy and spiritual, too...) Duh....
<p>
And about the success rate:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;That's less than
1.5% to 2.5% who stay clean for five years or more... and at what cost?&quot;</font>
<br>
Yes, that's what I got from calculating the success rate based on the numbers of
sobriety coins handed out. I got the number 1.63% for 5-year success stories.
The chart is
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin15">here</a>.

<p>
And this is one of the most important, really big questions:<br>
<font color="black">
Why are our courts ordering people to
attend church? Wouldn't there be some kind of concern and even outcry if
judges were sentencing people like my friend Humann to attend
Scientology meetings, or Catholic mass?<br>
</font>
Indeed. People would scream if the victims were sentenced to any other
church.  But through 70 years of clever advertising and self-promotion, the
Church of Alcoholics Anonymous has managed to pass itself off as a
&quot;spiritual, not religious, recovery program&quot;.
I still have to agree with what District Judge John Shabaz said.
In the case of <i>Grandberg v. Ashland County</i>, a 1984 Federal 7th Circuit Court
ruling concerning judicially-mandated A.A. attendance, the judge declared:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous materials and the testimony of the witness established
beyond a doubt that religious activities, as defined in constitutional law,
were a part of the treatment program.
The distinction between religion and spirituality is meaningless, and
serves merely to confuse the issue.<br>
&#8212; Wisconsin's District Judge John Shabaz<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And yet other judges in small traffic courts or drug courts ignore that
ruling, and either sentence people to A.A. meetings, or to
&quot;treatment programs&quot; that send the clients to A.A. meetings.

<p>
Good luck on your video. I'm also working on one for YouTube too, but it's about
<a href="orange-letters118.html#goslings2" target="newwin13">the orphaned gosling Carmen</a>.
It has nothing to do with alcoholism or drug addiction;
it's just a sweet story that I want to tell.
<p>
But then again, I think that is the real recovery process: You don't
spend the rest of your life talking about how miserable you were while
you were drinking or drugging, and become addicted to, or obsessed with, meetings
and cult religion practices
&#8212; you just get on with your life, and go do something better.
<p>
Maybe I'll get into some recovery-oriented videos after I get the hang of movie-making
with the goslings.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	the 3 unwritten rules of AA<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
thanks so much for the website and the truth about this
propaganda that has been sewn into the social fabric of the mainstream
by AA and the recovery/treatment industry. I will write again, but this
first letter is about why I quit AA.
<p>
First off, I admit that I have trouble committing to and
finishing alot of things (college, the Navy, AA).... but I did do the
best I could with AA. I got a sponsor, did the steps as best I could and
shared at meetings... sometimes.
<p>
Before I read the Orange Papers I was not aware of how
dangerous AA thinking (or not thinking) could be. The thing that
really stuck out for me was the information about the Synanon games and
the cult that used them, and their psychopathic leader. What is really
very disturbing is that they use that very method at the main rehab
center here on O'ahu. I've seen them do this while I was in there (17
days, left against 'medical advice')... and no one questioned it.
Everyone seemed to believe that it had therapeutic value. I thought it
was strange, bizarre mind games, and dreaded the idea of being put in
the hot seat. One woman in the outpatient program I currently attend who
went to that rehab for help, had her counselor tell her &quot;you're a drug
addict, you're a thief, and a liar&quot;. Then this woman (the client) said
that that was good for her and what she needed to hear.
<p>
The same woman said that her sponsor grilled her for hours on
her 4th step and asked her 33 questions for each person she &quot;harmed&quot; on
her 5th step. I don't think it was necessary for her to be interrogated
like a criminal suspect.
<p>
Anyway, back to me. After my last &quot;relapse&quot;, my
sponsor's sponsor (grand sponsor) suggested I do 2 things. One was to
write a farewell letter to alcohol (not really a bad idea), and the
other was to write down my thoughts that preceded my last binge
(another good idea, he was much more intelligent than most of the people
I've met in AA).
<p>
Well, I did both, but what I noticed about the 2nd exercise
was that my first thoughts surrounding my last binge were that I was
sick and tired of going to and sitting through AA meetings. Of course
any AAer would say &quot;there's the problem, you gave up on the program&quot;. I
suppose that if a person busies themselves with meetings and service
work and sponsoring, that could keep them sober, but I would think that
they would have to buy into the whole philosophy of the program to stay
motivated and I don't see how anyone can.
<p>
When we were children did we
not learn about right and wrong, good and evil, and religion? The 5th
step seems Catholic in nature, and for most non-Catholics (at least me
anyway) seems bizarre and unnecessary. But I did it, as I was supposed
to, and desperately wanted to lose the obsession, or desire, for
alcohol. Everyone seemed to think AA had (or was) the answer.
<p>
The steps seem to be geared toward the morally inept, and
spiritually bankrupt (by the way my former sponsor and his sponsor were
both atheists that used AA itself as their higher power) and egotists.
This is not a good way to view yourself if part of the reason for your
heavy drinking was low self-esteem (as it was for me).
<p>
<a name="3steps"> </a>
Not knowing the cult origins of AA, and not feeling good
about myself anyway, however, the steps seemed relatively harmless and
had this great reputation as a spiritual, moral support group program.
That's what everyone seems to think. I was not willing however to go
into AA's 3 unwritten steps which sound more like membership rules if
you go to enough meetings. Aside from speakers who go up and praise the
program while at the same time talking about how screwed up they are
even though they're sober, or the ones who just can't shut up about how
great they are now that they're in AA, you hear over and over and over
again...
<p>
1. Get a sponsor, stay in touch with them, and if they become
unavailable (or God forbid get a life), fire them and get a new one.
Later, you must sponsor a newcomer (the only way to keep it is to give
it away).
<p>
2. Get into service and commit to your obligation at your Home
Group (if your job and your family couldn't keep you sober, this will
surely do the trick).
<p>
3. Share at meetings (talk about your personal
life in front of a group of strangers), go up and tell your life story
(not the whole thing, just the part about your alcohol/drug abuse and
how AA saved your life)... and sing the praises of this wonderful
'fellowship'.
<p>
The only thing I can say in favor of AA is that if you get too
lonely and need to be around people who aren't drinking/using they're
available, but other than that... that's it! Don't wait for a miracle
that is not going to happen.
<p>
That's my story (part of it anyway).. Thanks again Orange, and
keep up the great work.

<p>
Ted

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ted, 
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
The first thing that caught my eye was the mention of Synanon
games.  Synanon &#8212; the insane brainchild of Chuck Dederich &#8212; is the
root of all of the &quot;confrontational therapy&quot; and
&quot;attack therapy&quot; techniques and organizations, and it is still quite popular,
as you noticed at your local &quot;treatment center&quot;,
in spite of the fact that it does not work and produces bad results.
Heck, Chuck Dederich and his commune degenerated
into a bunch of crazies, and Dederich's lieutenants
went to prison for attempted murder of critics and defectors, and Dederich avoided
prison only by copping a plea and giving up leadership of Synanon.
So much for the wonderful mental health produced by Synanon Games and confrontational
therapy.
<p>
Nevertheless, Synanon was the model for a whole crop of child and grandchild
programs:
<b>The Seed</b>,
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Straight" target="newwin15"><b>Straight, Inc.</b></a>,
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Miller_Newton" target="newwin16"><b>Kids of New Jersey</b></a>,
<b>Delancy Street</b>,
<a href="orange-gulags.html#DFAF" target="newwin17"><b>Drug Free America Foundation</b></a>,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Daytop" target="newwin19"><b>Daytop</b></a>,
<b>Phoenix House</b>, <b>Amity</b>, and more.
<p>
Right off the top of my head, I know that half of them, <b>The Seed</b>, <b>Straight</b>,
<b>Kids of New Jersey</b>, and <b>Drug Free America Foundation</b> were guilty
of vicious child abuse.  That's why they don't exist any more.
They were shut down amid criminal investigations and lawsuits.
But other descendants have taken their places.

<p>
The professions of psychology and psychiatry must be in very sick shape if shams
and quackery like Synanon Games and &quot;confrontational therapy&quot;
that are the best that they can recommend for drug and alcohol problems.
<p>
I also agree with the rest of your letter. &quot;The Three Other Steps&quot; are true.
Funny how cults' programs seem to always have some more duties that aren't
written down, or mentioned beforehand.
That's <a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_progressive_commitments">Progressive Commitments</a>,
another standard cult characteristic.
<p>
The third one, &quot;Share at Meetings&quot;, reminds me of the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#selfsell" target="newwin23">Self-Sell</a>
propaganda technique. You are urged to speak, and an unspoken assumption
is that you will say things that are acceptable to the group. You'd better,
if you want their approving smiles rather than hard frowns...  So you
scrounge through your mind trying to find something positive to say
about A.A. and the program and the great progress you are making...
The idea is, that you will start to believe that stuff. You will sell yourself
on the idea.
<p>
Make them say it enough times, and they will start to believe it. That's
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_cognitive" target="newwin24">Use of the Cognitive Dissonance Technique</a>.

<p>
A wacky cult called &quot;<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Gohonzon" target="newwin25">Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism</a>&quot; that I was
briefly trying out in the seventies used the same technique. At Sunday
morning meetings, newcomers were urged to get up in front of the whole congregation
and declare what
wonderful things have come to them, and which of their wishes were
granted, by chanting &quot;Nam-myoho-renge-kyo&quot; at a printed scroll.
Absurd as it may sound, say it enough times, and you will start to believe it.
They did.

<p>
Oh, and I can think of one other &quot;unwritten rule&quot; of A.A.:
<i>&quot;You can't criticize The Program.&quot;</i>

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Jim,
<p>
Congratulations on your years of sobriety.

<p>
Well, I'm not going to be making a phone call to you, because, as I explained
<a href="orange-letters103.html#qwest" target="newwin37">here</a>,
Qwest pulled the plug on my phone line for being a nice guy and
letting poor neighbors piggy-back on my DSL line, so I don't have a phone any more.

<p>
I have thought about getting another one, but I found that I usually
make only one phone
call a month (to the Veterans' Administration to renew my medications prescriptions),
so it isn't cost effective to pay $30 or $40 per month to make one phone call.
Right now I am saving $80 per month by not paying Qwest for phone service and
Internet access.
I'm looking at other non-phone methods of Internet access, like Clear, which
uses &quot;WiMax&quot; (microwave radio) technology. Getting one where the USB microwave
transceiver gizmo has a device driver that works on Linux is the challenge.

<p>
I do not conduct private, off-line debates.
I have barely enough time to keep up with answering my email, and have no time
to waste on a pointless back-and-forth argument that no one else will see or hear.
The online debates can either inform the public, or at least
entertain them. If you have something to say, then write it, and I'll print it.

<p>
Whether you believe it or not, the letters that I post are all real &#8212; real letters
that I really received from real people.  Like Ann Landers wrote when somebody accused
her of making up letters, I couldn't possibly make that stuff up.
My imagination isn't that good.
People are so wacky and crazy and creative and different, with such a wide range of
experiences and opinions, my imagination just cannot keep up with reality.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi again, John,

Yes, that is scary, and also just plain old frustrating. The year is 2009,

like the appropriate treatment of a life-threatening condition.

NOT REQUIRED: Knowledge of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,
Rational Behavioral Therapy,
Addictive Voice Recognition Therapy, or Self-Management and Recovery Training, or
anything else that actually works.

<p>
So I guess I'll have to write something.

Orange,

<p>
I'm loving the new letters you've posted. Thank you for keeping this
site going. It's a safe &amp; sane haven for people seeking recovery help.
Also, I follow the story of Carmen with great interest, and I love your
beautiful photographs of her and her fine feathered friends.

<p>
In
<a href="orange-letters129.html#halfway" target="newwin16">my last letter</a>
I recounted my interaction with the CARF folks &#8212; the
ones who don't give a damn about whether the facilities they approve
actually have any success jamming the 12 step program down peoples' throats.

<p>
My company (Fortune 500) donates a sizable amount of money to the same
halfway house I've been scrutinizing, which is the same halfway house I
got sentenced to back in the '90's and the same one which makes its
residents work for free on weekends restoring houses to turn into
extended treatment facilities (3/4 houses &#8212; does it never end? Once
these places get their hands on you they won't let you go for 1, 2 even
3 years.)

<p>
I found out one of my company's upper managers is the president of this
halfway house's board, so I decided to send her an e-mail outlining my
concerns about them shoving ineffective and dangerous cult &quot;treatment&quot;
on its hapless residents. I cited as much data as I could and kept the
e-mail unemotional (for fear of being labeled a nut.) I concluded by
asking that our company refrain from giving monetary support to the
place as long as they employ the 12 step method.

<p>
Here's the answer I got:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;As you are aware, many many treatment facilities adopt this approach to
sobriety and it works for many many people. I have no intention of
resigning from the board or advising (company name) to discontinue
supporting this program.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(For the record I never asked her to resign.)

<p>
Not a big surprise. So the next thing I did (and I should've done this
first) was to find out who at my company is in charge of doling out
money to worthy charities and causes. I sent this person an e-mail too,
outlining the same facts and studies, including information about AA's
side effects, like increased binge drinking and how the death rate
increases. A day later I got an e-mail back from the legal department
(!) from one of our attorneys asking if I would be willing to meet with
him to discuss the matter further. I agreed so we set up a meeting a
week hence.

<p>
The next day the head of my department calls me into his office and says
to me, &quot;I understand you have some concerns about how (company name)
disperses donations. Well, I would advise you to have your facts in
order.&quot;  I said, yeah, I got my facts straight and plenty of them. But
later as I sat at my desk I started freaking out. How did he know about
this so soon? Who told him? Was this some kind of veiled warning I
should heed? But it was too late &#8212; I set this thing in motion and now I
had to see it through.

<p>
So with some trepidation I met with the attorney. I have to tell you the
meeting went very well. He actually thanked me for raising the issue.
The very first thing he wanted to know was whether criminal activities
were taking place at this halfway house. I said I wasn't sure, so I
couldn't give him a definitive answer. Our company's reputation is
extremely solid and valuable so he needed to know if this was something
we had to urgently disengage ourselves from.

<p>
I explained my concerns and gave him copies of studies and statistics,
including the stats from the halfway house itself where it claimed a
90+% success rate. Rhetorically I asked him how it was possible that out
of 1400 men who entered the program, they could base their success rate
on only 43 survey responses &#8212;  and &quot;self-survey&quot; responses to boot, which
are notoriously unreliable. He nodded thoughtfully and asked a few
questions.  He told me he would raise the issue in a board meeting this
fall.

<p>
He then mentioned something really interesting which makes a lot of
sense and which is probably the main reason why companies just can't
seem to stop supporting places like this. He noted that although the
numbers I presented concerning AA's lack of success may be true,
companies support programs like this with money and &quot;personal assets&quot;
(people) because it looks and feels good both to the company to the
local communities. It's the same old bind: corporations and individuals
simply don't want to believe that they have been duped all these years.

<p>
There is a tragic irony that the shear size and breadth of the 12-step
falsehood is the very thing keeps people from believing that it's all a
lie. It's the craziest and most twisted of paradoxes. In addition,
there's a feel-good by-product to be gained by giving support which is
extremely hard to disabuse people from. After all, it sure feels so good
to be noble and helpful.

<p>
No matter what the facts are, people want to feel like they're doing
something good.

<p>
Like I said, the lawyer told me he would certainly raise these issues at
the next meeting. I think he sees my point. He also said that though my
company might not stop donating money to the place, it could very well
start asking for more accountability from it, beginning with an
independent study of its graduates to obtain a more accurate picture its
success rate.

<p>
I would be happy with that result.

<p>
Anyway, keep on truckin'.

<p>
Bill

Hi again, Bill,
<p>
Thank you for your efforts. Every little bit helps. It is both amazing and
appalling how the hoax continues because the hoax has continued for so long.
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Everybody knows it works,&quot;</font> just like how
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="newwin38">everybody knew</a> that the world was flat.
<p>
Hopefully that will change.
<p>
Have a good day.
