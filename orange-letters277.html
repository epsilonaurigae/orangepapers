<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I'm writing regarding a portion of Emma H.'s letter:<br>
<a href="orange-letters276.html#Emma_H" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters276.html#Emma_H</a><br>
as well as your response. I wouldn't wish to address all of it, as much of that was new info to me.

<p>
In regards to mental health and drugs/drink, I must disagree that &quot;I'm self
medicating&quot; is an excuse. Or rather, is always an excuse, or even usually an excuse.
I have no been diagnosed as bipolar, although it runs in the family, however I have
been diagnosed with some other mental disturbances. And alcohol was an excellent
means of self medication, at least for a while. It really was, with the anxiety and
depression and mild delusions, it was just the thing. Sure, I liked to get drunk,
but more often than not I was just trying to drink myself into the booze version of
a K-hole to escape the racket in my mind. Alcohol ceasing to function as an
effective means of self medication was one of the many factors that caused me to
decide that abstaining from alcohol was the way to go for me. However, in my case,
there's simply no denying that it worked, at least for a while.

<p>
I think cannabis is even more useful. I've been on the marijuana maintenance program
since long before I had sobriety to maintain. And I have no desire to give it up,
nor do I see adverse effects in my life beyond the fact that it involves inhaling
smoke. Which is easily solved with the introduction of a vaporizer.

<p>
It's been my observation that the US (and certain other countries as well) operate
much like a giant balance scale. The response is always too far in the other
direction, and it takes a while for things to level off. That's part of what's wrong
with the medical syndicate. Obviously, doling out mothers little helper and having
everyone and their brother low-grade speedballing on oral stimulants and sedatives
was bad juju. That said, now it's too far the other way. There are all sorts of
people who would be better off with discretionary access to a benzodiazapine or some
other kind of hypnotic or sedative drug, or even just a little grass, as opposed to
SSRI's, MAOI's,, tricyclic anti-depressants, whatever the hot new thing I'm missing
is.

<p>
All of the specialists I've seen have at least initially tried to foist those drugs
on me, despite my having a long history of those classes of drugs being unsuccessful
for treating my symptoms. When people need to ease their symptoms, they've sought
help and been denied it (simply due to people being hidebound no less), it would be
illogical not to seek to treat their own symptoms. The medical industry, while
perhaps less fraudulent, is an even more successful racket than the recovery
industry.

<p>
I must agree completely on your feelings regarding people who are doing a lot of
talking and have no genuine interest in cleaning up their act. It might be a bit
bleak, but more and more, I think (and this would go back to the gene thing) some
folks snap out of it, some die. And I think it will always be this way, at least to
some extent. Even miracle drugs would be useless until we could re-write someones
psyche.

<p>
P.S. I realize now that you were careful in how you worded that statement I misread.
SOME people absolutely do use self medication as an excuse. I should have known
better than to think you'd make such a sweeping statement. But, well, now I've
gotten this far, so I'm gonna hit send.

<font color="blue">
Hello Taylor,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Last item first: Yes, I was very careful in how I worded that response.
It's tricky. I don't want to appear to be just endorsing taking drugs, but neither do I want to condemn
medications.  If I appear to be just advocating smoking pot, then the rest of my message gets quickly
dismissed or ignored or lost in the hubbub.
(I hate to play politics, but sometimes you have to, at least a little bit.)

<p>
I'm actually a member of the Facebook group on marijuana as an alternative to addictions to drugs and alcohol.
And I've gotten some flack for that. What the heck.

<p>
Personally, I'd much rather see somebody smoking pot than drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco.
The annual death toll for just U.S. citizens is: over 400,000 dead from tobacco, over 100,000 dead from
alcohol, and about 15,000 more dead from drunk driving fatalities &#8212; both the drunk drivers and the
innocent sober people whom they hit.
And the score from marijuana: approximately zero. Oh, there might be one or two guys whose lung conditions
were made worse by smoking pot, but I cannot find any fatality counts for them.
<p>
I don't have a solid number for the death count from prescription drugs, but I know that it is sky-high too,
maybe 200,000 or 300,000. Michael Jackson and Elvis are just the most famous ones.

<p>
I'm all for the medical marijuana movement, and I'm happy that Oregon is one of
the states that has legalized medical marijuana. Still, I have not gotten a
marijuana card, and do not plan to. I've done my years of smoking pot, many years
ago, and now I'm saving my lungs for marriage. And I really like the clarity that
I have now, and you have to admit, pot does intefere with crystalline clarity.
So, the times they have a'changed.

<p>
But for those who do need some pot, it can be a big help. It's just another medicine,
and one of the least harmful ones we have.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I was directed to you from the Expose AA site regarding a particularily dangerous
and scam rehab facility in Battlecreek, MI.

<p>
It was originally a Narconon facilty but they closed down due to law suits. However
the previous owner merely opened it up under another name, and the same Scientology
nutjobs still run the place.

<p>
I am hoping one day a reporter will actually infiltrate the &quot;A Forever Recovery&quot;
center and verify all the stories and conditions listed in the compliants on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222909/http://RipOff.com/" target="_blank">RipOff.com</a>
and elsewhere.

<p>
I can testify to the truth.  A well meaning friend put me there a few years ago, but
I escaped within a few days.

<p>
This place is extremely dangerous and needs to be shut down.

<p>
Here is a link to the stories and abuses that occur there:

Hello C.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for your work to spread the word.
<p>
Scientology has a long history of trying to pass off their science-fiction lunacy as valid medical treatment
for drug and alcohol problems. They call it &quot;Narconon&quot;, and it features the teachings of the paranoid
schizophrenic Lafayette Ronald Hubbard. They have a treatment called the &quot;Purity Rundown&quot; 
that consists of lots of sweat baths and strange diet and drinks.
The U.S. Surgeon General has stated that their &quot;Purity Rundown&quot; is complete
quackery, and may kill you.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Carmen is the gosling that is sitting on the rock, and Blondie is the one that is looking at me.
You can see how Blondie is so much lighter than the other two goslings.
That is just natural variation. Some kids come out darker, and some lighter.
Blondie is just a &quot;blond-haired kid&quot;.  Carmen, on the other hand, is one of the darkest
of all of the goslings. She is a dark-haired beauty.<br>
Sam has decided to climb up on the rock and join Carmen. The mother is nearby, just off-screen.
<br>
By the way, this is the first day that I noticed Carmen letting go of the mother's skirts and relaxing
and being separated from the mother, by even a few feet. Previously, Carmen was pretty traumatized by
getting orphaned at such a young age, and she clung to her new mother like she was glued to her, for
fear of getting orphaned again.
But it appears that Carmen is beginning to get over it.

Subject:  	Re: 75% recovery rates?<br>

<p>
Hello Again Orange,

<p>
Thanks for the reply. I followed the link and found your analysis of the claimed
recovery rates in the 1940s, which answered my question.

<p>
As I said before, I'm right on the verge of leaving AA, but I've been so intertwined
with the culture for such a long time that it's proving to be very difficult. I'm
pretty sure that no one in my family will speak to me if they know I've left, and my
family is pretty involved in the local AA community. So much for &quot;anonymity.&quot;

<p>
Anyway, I've been reading so much more on your site and I'm seeing that I'm not the
only person who was dragged, kicking and screaming, into AA early on. When I was
about eleven years old, my mother became a devout AA member. Even though I'd never
had a drink in my life, she started telling me that I was an alcoholic anytime that
she and I had an argument, which only got worse when I was a teen. There wasn't an
Alateen group in my area at that time, or else she probably would have made me go
there. As it was, she manipulated me into going to AA with her by the time I was
thirteen. I trusted her because I had thought that as my mom, she knew me better
than I knew me, and I wanted to be a good daughter and overcome my rebelliousness
(even though the extent of it was a couple of times that I stayed at the mall with
friend past 9pm... blows my mind now to think of how &quot;bad&quot; she thought I was). My mom
urged me to get into the program myself, even though I
still hadn't had a drink ever. As much as I wanted to please her, I knew that
something was wrong. How could I say that I was powerful over alcohol when I was a
thirteen year old kid who had never had a drink, and was terrified of alcohol? So I
resisted and still went to meetings with her.

<p>
By the time I was seventeen, I was forced into the AA program in its fullness. I was
spending the night with a friend my age who had made the unfortunate decision to
steal a bottle of alcohol from the liquor store around the corner. I was scared to
death when I saw her pull out that bottle, so I started to leave her room. As I
opened the door, her mom walked in and saw the bottle. My friend, reacting in fear,
told her mom that I had brought the bottle. This would change my life forever. Her
mom called mine, and I was sent to a rehab. My mom never believed me when I told her
what had really happened, and to this day my former &quot;friend&quot; claims that I stole the
bottle. We're in our 20s now: you would think she'd have the guts to stand up for
the truth now. Anyway, in rehab I was the most horrible patient &#8212; because I wasn't
sick. Every day, at every meeting, I cried and asked to go home, stating again and
again that I hadn't ever had a drink in my life. They
kept me there, telling me I was in denial. After 30 days, I had made no
&quot;progress&quot; &#8212; I had only become very depressed. When my mom came to take me home, I
was so relieved... until she told me that we would be going to three meetings a day
for as long as it took to get me to see my problem. To accommodate this, she pulled
me out of school and began teaching me at home so we could go to a meeting whenever
&quot;I needed&quot; (she wanted). I felt like a prisoner, so I made the very difficult
decision to run away. Unfortunately, the police found me after my mom reported me
missing, so I ended up back at home for a couple of days before she shipped me off
to another rehab. Same story again: I cried my eyes out every day and tried so hard
not to internalize the untrue messages I knew I was hearing. But during this stay,
I reached my eighteenth birthday. I signed myself out immediately and went home,
but my mom would not let me stay.

<p>
I ended up living with a couple of friends from my old high school who had graduated
three years before. I lived there for about six months and barely made ends meet
working at Long John Silvers and finishing high school at night. Still had never
taken a drink &#8212; ever. Then, my mom hired an interventionist and staged an
intervention &#8212; and one of the people who showed up was my old friend who stole the
liquor! I couldn't believe it. I felt like I was going crazy. No one believed
anything I had to say. The interventionist kept saying that I was in denial, my
disease was talking, and I couldn't trust my own thoughts. I know now that
interventions try to force people to hit &quot;rock bottom,&quot; and I also know that since I
was out of the house, my mom had nothing to take away from me in order to force a
rock bottom. I figure the interventionist suggested that she start making promises
of what she would do for me if I entered rehab. My mom talked about how poor and
destitute I seemed &#8212; how I was such a smart girl, and it would be a shame to spend
my entire life struggling financially at Long John Silvers instead of going on to
fulfill my dream of becoming a scientist. So she promised that if I would spend
another 30 days in rehab, then really work the AA program after I got out, she
would pay for my college tuition and support me through college so I would not have
to work all day and take night classes. I was so exhausted by this time, and it
made me very weak. I started to think, &quot;Maybe I can pretend to go along with this
until I get through college. If things stay as they are now, I'll never afford an
education.&quot; I gave in and accepted the offer. My mom cried, and I didn't know
whether to sigh in relief or cringe at what was to come. I completed rehab,
pretending I was a real alcoholic the whole time. Brainwashing is a funny thing:
once you give in to it the slightest bit, even in pretend, it can start to take
effect. Within 30 days, I was convinced that I was an alcoholic. Again, never a
drink. I put myself fully into AA afterward, sponsor and all. I found myself making
up past drinking stories to report to my sponsor, who praised me for my submission
to the program.

<p>
I kept this up all through college, but God, I don't know how. My mom paid for
everything, as promised. I wanted for nothing, all through my BS and MS
education... except a bit of real sanity. I was so confused by the time I finished my
MS that I didn't know whether my thoughts or the ones I made up for the sake of AA
were true. It wasn't until I met another graduate of my MS program who was an ex-AA
that I began to deprogram and process the horrible events associated with my AA
experience. I'm so ready to leave AA for good. Now, I'm just afraid of what will
happen if my mom finds out. After finishing my master's degree I am now financially
independent, so it's not about that anymore. It's about the fact that I want to meet
someone, get married, and have children, and I want my mom to be part of that. I
know she'll refuse if I leave AA.

<p>
Thank you so much for listening and for your informative site. It nearly broke my
heart when I read the part about parents accusing their toddlers of being alcoholics
for being selfish, because in a way I could relate. How can parents do this to their
kids? How can medical professionals condone this? You're doing a much needed work
for mankind in maintaining this site. It's both comforting and chilling to know how
many others have been hurt.

<font color="blue">
Hello again Cecily,
<p>
Thank you for the story. That says so much.  I am glad to hear that you have escaped from 
the madness. 
<p> 
One thing that you really bring out is a giant problem
with the 12-Step culture: People who are insane get to decide whether other people are insane.
Anybody with some years in &quot;The Program&quot; is supposedly a fountain of light and wisdom, and qualified to
decide who else should get what &quot;treatment&quot;. That is quackery of the worst sort.

<p>
If your mother cuts you off and refuses to associate with you because you quit A.A., then that is her
choice. And that isn't love at all. It never was. Foisting such a cruel old cult religion on children
is not love. It is insanity.
<p>
Here is a frightening thought: Won't your mother try to shove your children into A.A., the same way as she
did it to you?
After all, her meddling and scheming worked with you, didn't it?
She got her way once, so why won't she do it again?
Won't she be calling the police on your children, too?
Maybe even give false testimony to take the children away from you,
because you are an &quot;unfit alcoholic mother&quot;?
Can you imagine her going into a courtroom and telling the judge that you are such a terrible
alcoholic that she had to put you into rehab repeatedly before the age of 21?
All of those false confessions could come back to haunt you.

Are you sure you even want her around?
Do you trust her to behave any better with your children than she did with you?

<p>
I am reminded of another story of a relative trying to hijack a daughter and get
her into A.A. and 12-Step &quot;treatment&quot;:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters42.html#lia" target="_blank">
her father's sister got involved, deciding that my daughter is a hopeless addict</a>,
she kinda kidnapped my daughter to a 3 month 12 step program. (90 meetings in 90 days)
</ul>

<p>
I hope the rest of your life is much happier. And have a good day now.

Hi Orange.
<p>
 The last time I wrote was in the spring. I want to say that your
site and the associated community continues to be a valuable resource to my
ongoing sobriety.

<p>
Before going on (long, long email), I want to mention that I would have
probably posted this in the forums, but I haven't received activation for
either of the two accounts that I registered three weeks ago. I don't think
you moderate them, but if you do, hook me up :)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Adam,
<p>
As you already noticed, it's fixed.
<p>
TO ALL:  I hate to have to hand-approve each registration,
but the Russian spam-bots are hammering the forum with attempts to post advertisements
for everything from London call girls to fake Viagra. I get 30 to 50 bogus registrations from
spam-bots for every real human registration, and I have to poke through them and guess
which ones are real humans. I'm getting to be very good at spotting spam-bot generated account

<p>
I want to take a moment to spread some information that I found. It's 4AM,
so hopefully I'm mostly coherent. Anyhow, as a brief introduction, I made
it to &quot;The Rooms&quot; at a fairly young age, and I have a considerable history
of drug/alcohol abuse starting in my teenage years. From ages 14-24 I was
at least partially suicidal with several attempts in the mid period. Given
such a disposition, I have struggled with a concern that the drugs/alcohol
I consumed (often with reckless abandon) would permanently affect my
aptitude as an adult, in term limiting my ability to achieve happiness
later on in life.

<p>
That led me to do some research. Before getting into some studies, I'd also
like to say that my real recovery from alcoholism began some time after I
left AA (as they say, &quot;if you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep
getting what you're getting,&quot; so I moved on). The paradigm shift that
changed my approach came from reading a text that addressed the
physiological aspect of alcoholism as opposed to the &quot;spiritual&quot; aspect. I
can't speak for you, but we may agree that education of this nature would
be more valuable than religious cult propaganda and psychobabble. I'll name
the text here, even though it is a decade old and some of the science is
outdated: <b>Seven Weeks to Sobriety</b>, by Joan Mathews Larsen, PhD. I don't
follow the diet they outline, but I am grateful to the author regardless.

<p>
Generally, what I have learned (and I realize I'm stating the obvious) is
that alcohol dependence/abuse has long-lasting (but seldom permanent)
effects on the body's systems that make recovery difficult, mentally and
physically. Appreciating some of these mechanisms has helped me
tremendously. For example, although the sample size is relatively small,
Dr. Larsen's treatment center found 88/100 patients had abnormal glucose
metabolism(Larsen, Joan Mathews 2011). It's not hard to imagine that
bombarding the body with pure sugar may throw metabolic systems out of
balance. As you probably know, some symptoms of blood sugar problems
include fatigue, depression, and panic attacks. Here's an article that
discusses the topic:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222909/http://knol.google.com/k/alcoholism-and-hypoglycemia" target="_blank">
http://knol.google.com/k/alcoholism-and-hypoglycemia</a><br>
<p>
(why didn't I learn this in my expensive rehab?). Ya'd think that with this
information, AA wouldn't stock its rooms full of coffee, cake, and cookies &#8212; 
right? Guess they have to get that whole &quot;attraction&quot; element somewhere.

<p>
Now, I'm no neuroscientist. From what I've read, as far as cognitive
impairment goes, it's well known that alcohol abuse/dependence does cause
brain dysfunction, with emphasis on the frontal lobes (Kril, Halliday
1999). It is also known that in as few as thirty days, the brain shows
notable improvements in the region, and long term abstinence can lead to at
least partial reversal in lost functionality (Sullivan 2000). Emphasis on
&quot;at least.&quot; Although I don't have an article to cite, I previously found a
few pieces that led me to believe that this reversal is so dramatic that
permanent impairment is negligible (if existent), especially in the average
alcohol abuse/dependence case.

<p>
So, what? Well, some symptoms of prefrontal cortex injury:

<p>
<ul>
<li> a decrease in voluntary motor behaviour
<li> decreased will and energy
<li> a tendency to engage in repetitive or preservative behaviour
<li> difficulty in shifting response set
<li> abnormalities of affect and emotion, particularly apathy, indifference, and shallowness
</ul>

<p>
Sounds like &quot;dry drunk&quot; behavior to me. Also, it reads like a relapse in
list format. What I get from this is that these are symptoms to watch for
and treat appropriately in the first year, which is roughly the amount of
time it takes the body to heal (no citation; variable). Just KNOWING these
facts is a huge thing for me. Knowing what I'm up against.. what to
expect.. and that there IS a light at the end of the tunnel, and that it
may be brighter than I can even appreciate now.. gives me a powerful
sensation.

<p>
I certainly find these symptoms easier to treat than &quot;resentment.&quot; I don't
mean to discount psychology &#8212;  just AA. I plan to continue taking wellbutrin
for a year (bonus of helping me quit smoking, which has been shown to
improve cognitive healing). I also am much more cautious about my diet.

Thanks for the information, Adam. That is highly relevant, and like you said, far more helpful
and realistic than confessing your resentments.

<p>
About the recovery from brain damage, yes, it really takes time. It took me 9 months before I could
remember faces &#8212; <i>any</i> faces, even Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, and Peter Jennings, whom I had seen
for 20 years.
And it took 5 years before my ability to remember little factoids and details returned.
But that stuff did come back. The brain really does heal itself.
So yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
<p>
I described that more
<a href="orange-letters31.html#memory" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters58.html#damage" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Someone else also mentioned <i>Seven Weeks to Sobriety</i> and hypoglycemia, and diet in recovery,
<a href="orange-letters126.html#seven_weeks" target="_blank">here</a>.
Check it out.

<p>
Not coincidentally, I faithfully take vitamins twice a day. I take a big one-a-day like Centrum Silver,
and B Complex with C, and more C, and Calcium with D, both morning and evening.
It helps. I don't get a big dramatic boost from them.
It isn't like a Popeye cartoon where he instantly turns into superman from a dose of spinach,
but over the years, the vitamins really make a noticeable difference in the quality of life and health.
(And I just had my annual checkup with the doctor again, and they made like a vampire and sucked a bunch
of blood out of me and ran about every test in the laboratory, and all of my numbers look very good.)

<p>
Oh, and congratulations on the quitting smoking. That really does matter, too.
It is much easier for the body to heal the damage and get healthy when it doesn't have to also
survive chronic tobacco poisoning.
<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

From:  	&quot;Ward&quot;<br>
Subject:  	NA and the Big Bad Wolf<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
I have followed your site now for a few months and I'm amazed at the level of
commitment and depth of the research that you have amassed in your endeavor to
debunk much of the pendantic dogma that pervades throughout the 12 step culture. My
hat's off to you. I'm certain you're aware that one of the most difficult things for
a human can do is to push against the tides of ignorance/arrogance that courses
through blind faith.

<p>
So having lauded your efforts, why will I actually have the timerity to defend (to a
certain point) Narcotics Anonymous? Well, it certaintly has nothing to do with
sponsorship, working the steps, or submitting the will up to an autocratic space
ju-ju who doesn't give two fucks about whether you shoot,smoke,drink, or snort your
body into a quivering piss stinking mass of pain or choose to live soberly. Nope,
I'm talking about the simple decision that's made when we excerise our will. At a
certain point, any thinking person must, when evaluating the consequences of
continued substance abuse, finally weigh the pros and cons and make a choice. Live
or Die. Simple.

<p>
If a decision is made to attempt sobriety, we can face substantial hurdles if our
addiction has reached an advanced state. Often we are unemployed, mal-nurished,
divorced from friends and family, spiritually/morally bankrupt, perhaps without
shelter, possibly being investigated by law enforcement, and always, always, always
aware that we have entirely contributed to our own destitution. We are to blame in
toto. No one has forced us to abuse substances.

<p>
So what to do? Well....here's the rub. The price of NA is certainly right. One can
come straight off the streets and into a welcoming group of people, who appear to
accept us without reservation. The newcomer is showered (sometimes quite literally)
with attention and affection. Now Orange...you and I know that this is the hook.
But, in my case (annectdotal of course) it seemed like a reasonable compromise. So I
went in. Eyes open. I took freely of their hospitality, never once conceding to
accept their dogma and have returned the favor by offering my assistance when I
could. I remain, to this day, an avowed strident athetist. I share at meetings and
am truly accepted for my integrity. I have never given credit to Narcotics Anonymous
for the remission of my addiction however; I do acknowledge that in fellowship with
recovering addicts, I monitor and maintain my own sobriety. Hence, my &quot;need&quot; to
continue to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

<p>
I have no problem counseling either the atheist or the believer. If a person needs a
method, I point them to the 12 steps and sponsorship. (with people that I'm
absolutely certain have only the persons continued sobriety as a goal) If not, I
discuss the power of the will and accoutability to self and community. I would like
to point out that while my views are in the minority...I have never been told that I
had to change them. I've not been ostracized or ridiculed. As a matter of fact, I
often get sent the most hopeless cases. I sponsor no one. I do not believe that a
person has any right to dance in another's head when they are sick and
impressionable. I just let them know that, however they chose to clean up; it's the
right way for them. And that a better life is available with a few choices and some
hard work.

<p>
I guess this is where you and I part in our opinions Mr. Orange. I take umbrage with
the statement that AA/NA has helped no one. While I agree with you that Bill W. was
a two-bit con man with messianic pretensions. I truly believe that the program, at
this stage in it's development, has the ability to self correct. I've seen evidence
of that....no longer are people told to discount their doctors courses of treatment.
Measures are being implemented to identify and purge predators. You see
Orange...while I completly agree with you concerning the origins and some the
continued garbage /pitfalls/ and dangers that this program harbours, I have to
(gently) admonish your tone, my friend.
<a name="steered"> </a>
 I will ask you a rhetorical question. Have
you considered the fact that your strident style may have actually steered a person
away from an experience that could possibly have saved their lives? If one person
dies because they believed in your message completly, do you not assume some
culpability? You're obviously an intelligent man. But is your passion tempered with
compassion? Only you can find that answer. That old phrase...don't throw the baby
out with the bathwater comes to mind. I have read your bio and I empathize with your
experience. Sometimes even the best of intentions fail. Have you ever pondered if
the same drives that powered Mr. Bill Wilson vision may also reside in your personal
crusade?

<p>
Going to end this now. I thank you for allowing me to have my say. I respect the
fact that you will no doubt read this little missive and address me with a reasoned
response. And that my friend, is the best we have to offer one another.

<p>
Best to you, Ward

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ward,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You make a bunch of good points. And thank you for your non-conformist work
to help sick addicts.
<p>
These simple sentences are so true:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I'm talking about the simple decision that's made when we excerise our will. At a
certain point, any thinking person must, when evaluating the consequences of
continued substance abuse, finally weigh the pros and cons and make a choice. Live
or Die. Simple.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is also what SMART teaches. They call weighing the benefits and costs of any course of
action a &quot;Risk/Reward Ratio&quot;.
(For some examples, look <a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters15.html#cost_benefit2" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters38.html#cost_benefit3" target="_blank">here</a>.)
I use the accountants' name &quot;Cost/Benefit Analysis&quot; for the same thing.
And considering the dire consequences of continued drinking and smoking is basically how I saved my own life.
My doctor put it this way, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
I thought it over for a while and decided to live.

<p>
Alas, that is at odds with 12-Step teachings. They say that you are powerless over your addiction and your
thinking is screwed up and self-reliance is a bad thing, and you have to just surrender to &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
And Bill Wilson raved about how
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#self_reliance" target="_blank">will power and self-will was evil, and against the Will of God</a>.
Those teachings do more harm than good.

<p>
What you are defending is common-sense sanity, not the 12-Step programs of A.A. or N.A.
<p>
Now this line is totally true:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Often we are unemployed, mal-nurished,
divorced from friends and family, spiritually/morally bankrupt, perhaps without
shelter, possibly being investigated by law enforcement, and always, always, always
aware that we have entirely contributed to our own destitution.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So does N.A. conduct cooking classes? Give any education on nutrition? What a lot of addicts really need
is a good meal, not a confession session. Coincidentally,
<a href="orange-letters277.html#Adam_M" target="_blank">the previous two letters</a> both discussed the
problem of malnutrition in addiction and ADHD cases. 

<p>
Do A.A. or N.A. run any social service programs, the way that the Salvation Army does?
Help people to get jobs? Housing? Money? Clothes? Medical care? No. In fact, Bill Wilson instructed the
12-Step recruiters not to be of service:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th editions, William G. Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 98.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So don't help the alcoholics, and don't perform any services for them.
Bill says that <a href="orange-rroot930.html#Tod_Sloan" target="_blank">they must learn to rely on God</a>.

<p>
Your last phrase,
<font color="black">
&quot;always, always, always aware that we have entirely contributed to our own destitution&quot;</font>
does indeed describe a problem that recovering addicts and alcoholics have.
The answer is not to repeatedly do Steps 4 through 7 and confess our &quot;wrongs, moral shortcomings, and defects
of character&quot; to man and God. That just makes the burden of guilt worse, and drives people crazy by
dwelling on the negative. A.A. and N.A. confession sessions do not erase guilt, like they advertise.
The guilt often drives people to relapse.

<p>
This line seems to be describing the 12-Step organization on some other planet:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I truly believe that the program, at
this stage in it's development, has the ability to self correct. I've seen evidence
of that....no longer are people told to discount their doctors courses of treatment.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No longer? As of when? The last time I checked, &quot;the program&quot;
had gotten worse. Ever heard of
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy Imusland and his &quot;Pacific Group&quot;</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Mike Quinones and his &quot;Midtown Group&quot;</a>?

<p>
I never said that <font color="black">&quot;AA/NA has helped no one.&quot;</font>

<a href="orange-letters206.html#helped_nobody" target="_blank">What I said is</a>,
that they kill more people than they save:
<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font color="black">
Though millions of people have attended AA, Orange will not admit
that AA has helped a single one of them.<br>
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, that is not accurate. I have said several times that it is impossible
to prove individual cases from statistics.
Four years ago, I wrote this in
<a href="orange-letters12.html#prove_individual" target="_blank">a response to a letter</a>.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is not possible to prove or disprove that one individual
person was helped or not helped by A.A.; it is only possible
to show that A.A. did or did not help A GROUP of people
become more sober than another group who didn't get any
A.A. treatment.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is possible that A.A. helped one guy &quot;Joe&quot; to quit drinking,
while pushing 5 or 6 other guys towards their deaths by indoctrinating
them with horrible cult dogma like that they are powerless over alcohol,
and can't quit on their own, and can't ever get cured, and are disgusting
sinners who need to do a Fifth Step and confess everything to their
Sponsor...
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Oh, and you need to stop taking those pills that the
psychiatrist gave you. Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;
</font>

<p>
So it is theoretically possible that
<a href="orange-letters12.html#prove_individual2" target="_blank">A.A. helped one guy in some way, while simultaneously
killing five or six others</a>.
I don't consider that &quot;helping people&quot;.

A.A. killed Tom, Dick, and Harry with bad advice and crazy dogma and misinformation and cult religion
and telling sick people not to take their medications.<br>
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
I'm sure that some people benefit from the moral support, but
the 12-Step program does more harm than good.  For every Joe who got helped by A.A./N.A. moral support,
Tom, Dick, and Harry were made worse by the dead-wrong teachings of Dr. Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant</a>,
for instance, tracked his first 100 A.A.-treated alcoholic patients, and at the end of
8 years, the score was 5 continuously sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
That is nearly a 6 to 1 kill ratio  &#8212; 29/5.
<p>
Now we cannot blame A.A. for all of the deaths. I am sure that many of them were going to die anyway,
from what alcohol did to their livers, and kidneys, and brains, and the rest of their bodies.
But Dr. Vaillant studied several other ways of treating alcoholism, and no other method for treating
alcoholics created such a high death rate.
So A.A. is sure due the credit for some of those deaths.

<p>
Then of course
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma found that A.A. increased binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found that A.A. increased the rate of rearrests of alcoholics</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Walsh found that A.A. increased the cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.

<p>
What is obvious is that the 12-Step teachings are harmful.
It's really not much different than teaching people that they can cure streptococcus and
staphylococcus infections with prayer and incantations and confessions.
The fact that some people survive that treatment and recover does not prove that the treatment works.

<p>
Now you mention that you are an atheist. That really does not change the nature of the 12 Steps or
what they do. The 12 Steps are really
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the recruiting and indoctrination and brainwashing techniques
of Dr. Frank Buchman's cult</a>.
They never had anything to do with quitting alcohol or drugs.
They had everything to do with messing up people's minds.

<p>
The 12 Steps don't really have much to do with God, either, in spite of the repeated mentions of God in
6 of the 12 Steps. Remember that the Chinese Communists used the same practices on American prisoners of war
during the Korean War, and they were not converting the soldiers to belief in some God. Rather,
they were converting the soldiers to belief in Communism.
In the Chinese program, the &quot;Higher Power&quot; that you surrender to is The Communist Party.
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">It's still just the same program</a>,
with different labels slapped on things. (Click on that last link for a cheat-sheet on brainwashing.)

<p>
This line is classic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Have you considered the fact that your strident style may have actually steered a person
away from an experience that could possibly have saved their lives?
If one person
dies because they believed in your message completly, do you not assume some
culpability?
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, I've considered it. I've also considered that I might have warned someone away from an extremely
harmful cult that might have driven them to relapse and death.
And many people have told me that, and thanked me for it.

<p>
The accusation that I'm killing alcoholics (or addicts) by driving them away from the 12-Step salvation
is really an old over-used Stepper's line. I have a long list of such accusations here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin42">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters128.html#disservice</a>
<p>
And not a one of those true believers who accused me of driving people away from the 12-Step cure has ever
plainly stated what the actual A.A. or N.A. cure rate is. So I'll ask again,
<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman"> 
<font color="blue">

What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year

Or even several years later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">here</a>.)
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
You may substitute the N.A. cure rate, and N.A. keytags given out, in the above questions if you wish.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
As a human there is no denying the 12steps and  this way of life has helped
millions in the AA fellowship and every other step program inspired by AA.
I can hear the anger in what you write about Bill and wonder why you have
it.  Good luck to you and I will say a prayer for you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello GFM,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
A.A. has not &quot;saved millions&quot;, or &quot;helped millions&quot;.
That is a standard lie that A.A. constantly repeats,
but there is no truth to it. The real answer is much closer to zero.
The claims that A.A. is a great success that has saved millions is just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's bombastic
grandiose lying</a>. (Click on that link and check it out.)

<p>
The 12 Steps were not &quot;inspired by AA&quot;. Bill Wilson copied them from
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion,
the &quot;Oxford Group&quot;</a>.
Dr. Buchman used those practices for recruiting and indoctrinating his new cult members.

<p>
Your subject line, &quot;Even if he failed&quot;, implies that maybe Bill Wilson failed. No, he didn't fail
at all. His goal was to set up a cult that would support him in comfort for the rest of his life and make him rich.
Bill succeeded. He never worked a straight job again, and he retired to his country estate, driving a Cadillac,
while the money rolled in. He spent the rest of his life
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">collecting royalties for a copyright that he stole</a>.
Bill Wilson lied and
<a href="orange-aaws.html" target="_blank">he stole</a>
and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">he philandered</a>
and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">he raved grandiose lunacy</a>
and the suckers worshipped him for it.

<p>
I consider it a despicable crime to foist an old cult religion on sick people and lie to them about how
well it works to cure their problem. That's why you hear some anger in my voice.
Such behavior is not only unspiritual, it is beneath contempt.
And lying to sick people in the name of God is really unforgiveable.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas now.

You're making more controversy than objective understanding. The criticism you have
and fierce pursuit to lay AA in the dust forever is exactly what you accuse AA of
doing to you. You are as bad as they are!!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Nick,
<p>
That makes no sense.
Criticizing quackery is not the same thing as foisting quack medicine on sick people.

Criticizing quack medicine that hurts people is a good thing to do.
And of course we want to lay the fraud in the dust.

</font>
<p>
AA is free. It is a mutual help network. In such, it attracts the worst cases. For
people who can and want to work the program, people who have nothing to lose, it is
a godsend.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<ul>
<p><li>
A.A. is not free. It costs you your mind and your soul.
And the 12-Step treatment center will be happy to empty your bank account for you.

<p><li>
A.A. is not a &quot;mutual help network&quot;. It is a lying cult religion.

<p><li>
A.A. is not a Godsend.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
 A.A. even drives sick people to
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">suicide</a>.
<p><li>
Everybody has something left to loose. Like their life and their mind. And their soul. And their morals.
And their self-respect.
</ul>

</font>
<p>
You act like the spirituality aspect of it is bad. That is okay. But think about how
many people are grateful for that aspect. AA is like a book, if you don't like it,
put it down.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. I am all for spirituality and spiritual behavior. Foisting
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>
on sick people and lying to them about how it works as a cure for
alcoholism is not spiritual.
</font>
<p>
AA is silent on the levels of press radio and film. They don't promise anything
publicly. Court cards and connections to rehabs are at the desire not of AA, but
those institutions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is not silent. Their fake anonymous attitude is outrageous hypocrisy.
<p>
Don't you remember all of the plugs in
<i>Cagney and Lacy, Hill Street Blues, ER, Dr. Phil, Dr. Drew, The West Wing, The History Detectives</i>...
And then <i>28 Days, Clean and Sober, The Days of Wine and Roses</i>...

<p>
Then the salesmen and promoters of 12-Step treatment plant fraudulent articles in every journal that they can.

<p>
Look
<a href="orange-letters236.html#promotion" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters191.html#promotion" target="_blank">here</a> for much more on that promotion.

<p>
Of course the coercive recruiting in courts and rehabs is &quot;at the desire of AA&quot;. They help to
do it.
<a href="orange-letters55.html#AA_cooperation" target="newwin60">Look here</a> for quotes from the official
A.A. policy statement.

I hope you'll include this in your site. Have a great day!
