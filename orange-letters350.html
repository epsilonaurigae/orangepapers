<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Here's a story of a poor young person struggling with drugs. She completes rehab,
goes to an NA meeting and meets a man whom her mother believes was her downfall. One
more 12-Step fatality.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321215152/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/local/20130328_Mother_of_dead_Falls_Twp__woman_found_in_Burlco_always_held_out_hope.html" target="_blank">

I always enjoy your site and your bird photos &amp; stories. I hope you have a beautiful

Hello Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the tip. That is really sad. Obviously, the police detectives have not
figured it all out yet, but I guess they will. It would be jumping to conclusions
to say that she went to N.A. and then she got killed, so N.A. caused her death
(<a href="orange-propaganda.htlm#post_hoc" target="_blank"><i>pos hoc, ergo propter hoc</i></a>), however,
that may well turn out to be the case.
<p>
The mother of the girl, Dee Lynch, said that her daughter
met a boy at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.  
&quot;That was the beginning of her downfall,&quot; said Lynch, 51, of Levittown.
<p>
This story certainly indicates the danger inherent to going to a meeting of drug addicts, ex-convicts,
and psychopaths, and expecting to find loving friendships and good advice and trustworthy counselors.

<p>
Murdering a young woman always strikes me as especially sad. Maybe it's just my biological imperative,
but I can't help but think that she could have been some man's wife and lover. She could have had a full
and useful and meaningful life. Instead, some asshole just kills her. What a waste.
<p>
This story bears watching to see what the police learn.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Snake Oil of Steppism on the job<br>

<p>
Hi, Orange.
<p>
 I've been thinking about Wilson's Step Cult a lot lately
because of an episode at work and because &quot;the program&quot; is now
advertised on the radio here. I wonder when they started that; years ago
they always claimed it was a program of attraction, not promotion.
Orange, keep up the good work. Your site is helping people, and
hopefully sending them down the road of the great journey of reality.

<p>
Lately the moonbeams and gibberish of the Step Cult intruded upon my
place of work, and I was freshly reminded of how counter-productive and
yes, harmful the Step fraud truly is. We had a guy in our department who
was bitterly resentful about the past, self-piteous, angry, sullen,
always quick to take offense and ready to confront, and apparently also
very unlucky in love. He was involved in some type of a bar fight in
which women, broken glass, the county jail and the state police were all
featured.......and then we started to hear the timeless cultic crap
which betrays immersion in the Step quackery: &quot;I have a disease! I have
a disease that wants to see me dead! My sponsor says....! I have to get
goin' on my 4th Step! There but for the grace of God! KISS! Take the
cotton out of your ears and stuff it into yer mouth!&quot;
<p>
Then he started to volunteer highlights of his &quot;alcoholic
insanity&quot; to all of us, which I realized immediately were his rehearsals
for his 90 day &quot;qualification&quot; or drunkalogue before a live audience of
the fellowship.
<p>
Well, we never found out if he made his 90 days and got his
coin. He was on the second shift, and he left a note on the manager's
desk explaining, &quot;I can no longer work at this business. This business
as well as this region are threats to my sobriety....&quot; From the
grapevine (npi) we heard that he left the state (took a geographic as
they say in the Step Cult). He walked away from a position of authority
and responsibility without informing anyone. The physical plant of a
business employing hundreds and serving thousands was abandoned without
security or supervision. There could have been a fire or a flood or
similar emergency, but he didn't give a rat's ass because it &quot;endangered
his sobriety&quot;.

<p>
Steppism bills itself as &quot;a bridge back to reality&quot; but as this man's
case clearly shows that is their biggest lie of all. The guy had
psychological problems. Maybe low self esteem. Maybe chemical
imbalances. Maybe lack of education. He had legal problems.
Interpersonal problems. He had financial problems. But AA convinced him
that his <i>_only_</i> problem was &quot;the disease of alcoholism&quot; and the only
solution was meetings, meetings, meetings.
<p>
His sponsor very likely told him that anything that threatened
his sobriety had to go as a matter of self preservation---this is like a
blank check and a visa to irresponsibility and the shunning of
adulthood. It is flight from reality.

<p>
So what did working the Steps and the Program deliver to this poor guy?
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Perhaps.......he isn't drinking.
<li><p>
He has no job, income nor hope of unemployment comp.
<li><p>
He will be a fugitive if he doesn't go back to court.
<li><p>
He swallowed the magic bullet &quot;disease concept&quot; and might never address
his real problems.
<li><p>
He is more isolated from reality than ever.
<li><p>
He has no relationships now; he only has instant Step Cult pseudo
relationships.
</ul>

<p>
Joyous Easter, (your friends have plenty of eggs)

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Andy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the sad story. That says so much. About all that I can do is agree.
<p>
There are some things that are just so obvious that they are self-evident. Like one judge said,
<b>
&quot;There are some things, like finding trout in your milk, that are just self-evident.&quot;</b>
Obviously, that poor guy needed a good psychiatrist, not an A.A. sponsor. But A.A. hides behind
the self-aggrandizing line in the <i>Big Book</i>,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Here was a book that said that I could do something that all
these doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd
been going to for years couldn't do!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.</font><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
So A.A. sponsors imagine that they can cure cases that the doctors cannot cure. And with Bill Wilson's
quack medicine and Buchmanite cult religion, yet. Fat chance.
<p>
About the advertising, I don't know when it started either, but I can remember 12
or 13 years ago, seeing A.A. commercials on late-late-night TV, and hearing
commercials for Al-Anon on the radio (<i>&quot;We want our lives back.&quot;</i>
So join Al-Anon and confess what a bitch you are, and how you drove hubby to drink.)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	predators anonymous<br>

<p>
Terrance,

<p>
This is Jennifer again.  Something that's been on my mind is why more victims of
fellow members don't come forward.  Where I live there is a spinoff of Clancy's
group.  One of my boyfriends I had in AA, (which I now call Predators Anonymous,
lol) was asked by many men in AA to do male porn.  This was at a meeting that
attorneys, doctors etc attended.  Two of my female friends in AA had their children
molested by men they were dating in the program.

<p>
Then look what happened to me over and over again by the old timer men.

<p>
I had highly educated sponsors that were true believers of the AA nonsense.  Just
because you are educated in a certain field doesn't make a person intelligent.

<p>
I wish more people that have been victims of fellow members would come forward, but
unfortunately I think they ultimately blame themselves.  Its quite sad really.

<p>
Anyway keep at it.  Love your site. :)

<p>
Jennifer

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello Jennifer,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments, and the question. I guess that people don't report
abuse in A.A. for the same reason as most women don't report rapes (and in fact, it is sometimes
the same crime). I hear that something like 80% or 90% of all rapes are never reported.
The women don't want to be tortured again by a police interrogation and then a defense attorney
grilling. And they are afraid that they cannot prove the crime. It's just she said versus he said.
Wasn't she secretly willing and inviting it?
<p>
And yes, they do blame themselves. That is shown in a lot of the standard cult characteristics:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong" target="_blank">2. You are always wrong.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">33. Newcomers can't think right.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_confessions" target="_blank">36. Confession Sessions.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness" target="_blank">43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_no_respect" target="_blank">51. Members Get No Respect. They Get Abused.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_dispensed_truth" target="_blank">60. Dispensed truth and social definition of reality</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_obliterate_self" target="_blank">66. Calls to Obliterate Self</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">67. Don't Trust Your Own Mind.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">68. Don't Feel Your Own Feelings.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_new_identity" target="_blank">75. New Identity &#8212; Redefinition of Self &#8212; Revision of Personal History</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">90. Newcomers Need Fixing.</a>
</ul>

<p>
On top of that, A.A. has the advantage that people are afraid that they will die if they leave
the organization.  A.A. is very good at
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">Phobia Induction</a>,
so some people imagine that they just have to put up with the abuse in order to survive.
Then they rationalize and minimize and deny and think that it isn't so bad. And that was just one bad apple...
The rest of the organization is okay.

<p>
You are right that being highly educated does not necessarily make someone intelligent, or wise, or sane.
Synanon had a doctor member who performed vasectomies on all of the young men so that the cult leader
Chuck Dederich wouldn't be bothered by crying babies. And Jonestown had a doctor and a nurse who mixed
up the cyanide Flavor-Aid for everyone to drink. Hard to believe, but true. Even highly educated people can
still desire a guaranteed ticket to Heaven, and they are often willing to give up their logical thinking
minds to get it.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Hello Monica,
<p>
Thanks for the note. What a clever idea. Give the A.A. &quot;Big Book&quot; a negative book report. But of course.
And there is so much to criticize, from the exploitative Buchmanite cult religion to the medical quackery
to
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's insane ravings</a>
about how practicing Buchmanism and confessing his sins made him feel like he was riding a rocket into the
fourth dimension...

<p>
And then of course there is the horrendous failure rate that comes from actually practicing what is in the book.
And the death rate. And the divorce rate. And the suicide rate.
<p>
Here is a little ammunition:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">Birth of BigBook</a>
<li> <a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">A.A. and Religious Faith</a>
<li> <a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank"><i>Big Book</i> Recruiting Mind Games</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. raises the rate of binge drinking</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">A.A. raises the rate of rearrests</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">A.A. increases the costs of hospitalization</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">The effective A.A. cure rate, above and
beyond normal spontaneous remission, is zero.</a>
<li> For more about the high A.A. failure rate and dropout rate, look
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">here</a>.

<li> <a href="orange-letters317.html#iamnotastatistic2" target="_blank">A.A. has a really bad sexual abuse rate.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">A.A. increases the suicide rate.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">A.A. increases the divorce rate.</a>
</ul>

<p>
And then there are all of the contradictions where Bill Wilson talked out of both sides of his
mouth on every issue. And
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">all of the inherent bait-and-switch tricks</a>.
Oh yes, there is much to talk about.
<p>
Oh, and we can do the same thing with Bill's second book, &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;, too.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Your site is pretty immense so I apologize if I missed it, but if AA is not
the answer, then what is?

<p>
Bruce

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bruce,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. At the risk of sounding like I'm joking or being sarcastic (which I'm not), I'll ask,
&quot;When you say, 'What is the answer,' I have to ask, 'What is the question?'&quot;
<p>
You asked for an answer without saying what your question is.
<p>
Now I'm going to make an educated guess, and assume that you must mean, &quot;How does someone quit drinking
alcohol without participating in A.A.?&quot;
<p>
The answer to that is simple: You just quit. Quitting is often very easy. You can quit drinking in
five minutes flat. I did.  (That story is
<a href="orange-letters26.html#what_works" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters303.html#pizza" target="_blank">here</a>.)
<p>
What is difficult is staying quit. Like Mark Twain joked, &quot;Quitting smoking
is easy. I've done it thousands of times.&quot;
The same goes for quitting drinking or drugging or smoking, or any other bad habit.
At any A.A. or N.A. meeting, you will hear somebody bragging
about how many clean-and-sober-1-day coins and keytags he has collected. But it took him forever to
get to a year, if he ever did.

<p>
So how do you stay quit? And why would someone backslide and go back to drinking or drugging or smoking
after he has quit and stopped the miserable routine?
 
<p> 
The problem is that people are of two minds: On the one hand, they want to quit
drinking or drugging or smoking or over-eating, so that the pain and discomfort
and expense and inconvenience will stop. But on the other hand, they want the fun
and pleasure to continue. Part of them still wants to indulge.
<p>
To make matters more difficult, after you quit your bad habits,
the craving center in the base brain will constantly complain
and argue and beg and wheedle for you to consume more drugs or intoxicants.
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster"</i></a>&quot;
has a zillion excuses that say why a little more drinking or drugging or smoking will be okay.
(So click on that link and read about that. The knowledge in that web page was a life-saver
to me.)

<p>
To really quit and stay quit, you have to get your head straightened out and be very clear
about just what you really want. As the Sufis call it, you need to <i>set your will</i>,
and <i>set your intent</i>.  Just sort-of-wanting-to-quit rarely ever works out well.
<p>
Now this is where the various kinds of rational recovery come into the picture. They can teach
you things that help with that. Note that I used
lower-case letters there. Rational Recovery, with capital letters, is one kind of rational recovery.
But there are also SMART and SOS and Lifering and WFS and HAMS, and more, and they all have something
to offer. The entire list of them is here:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>
<p>
SMART teaches a few techniques like how to recognize and reject irrational thoughts
that slip into your mind and drive you crazy and get you into trouble. They also
teach a &quot;risk-reward ratio&quot; analysis that helps to straighten
out your thinking about drinking.  (I prefer to call it a &quot;Cost-Benefit Analysis&quot;,
which is what accountants call a projected business plan.) That is where you
compare the likely pleasure and the pain that will come from various possible courses
of action, and decide which hurts less, and which gets you more of what you want.
I already wrote up a couple of examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit" target="_blank">Cost-Benefit Analysis</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#cost_benefit2" target="_blank">another cost-benefit analysis</a>
</ul>

<p>
Then, I discussed various things that helped here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>
There are a couple of lists of links to letters and discussions of what works, and how well
they work.

<p>
Also see the Top 10 reading list for some good books that say a variety of things.
There is some good stuff there:
<a href="orange-top10.html" target="_blank">Top 10 Reading List</a>.
                                                   
<p>
Good luck now, and don't hesistate to write back if you have more questions.

<p>
because I stopped going to meetings. Somehow I don't &quot;count&quot; as a sober person anymore.

<p>
I stopped getting coins quite a few years before I actually left. I also stopped
listening to the pompous ass old-timers. Not long after I left, this local AA
old-timer guru called me up. Not to see if I was doing OK, but to see if I'd crashed
&amp; burned yet. First thing he asks is if I'm drinking. When I say no, I'm actually
doing really well. He says &quot;Well, things aren't always what they seem. What's your
spiritual condition?&quot; I told him to fuck off and hung up on him. I guess he got the
answer he wanted.

@Jim: about the old-timer guru calling you up to see if you had relapsed yet:
They really are like ghouls, aren't they? Seeing if you are dead so that they can

Hi again, Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I saw that. Impressive. And appalling. It's disgusting how &quot;loopholes&quot; in the
law allow gangs of criminals to foist quack medicine on sick people and and commit fraud and
 bilk them out of millions of dollars.
And even kill the patients. When, oh when will the Attorney General get his act together and shut down
Scientology?

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Re: Another Bullshit Comment from the Peanut Gallery<br>

<p>
I think my last email got lost in the spam filter. There's probably a copy on my
laptop still, but I've stopped using it, for reasons I'll explain below.

<p>
For a couple of weeks now, I've been having an issue where the charger stopped
charging the laptop, so I kept having to fiddle with it until it started charging
again. I took it in to Best Buy, and it turned out the A/C port was loose and I
would have to send it in for repairs. For fuck's sake, I sent it in a month ago!
That was pretty much the straw that broke the camel's back right there. Laptops
shouldn't need major repairs every year when they're still covered by a warranty.
Fucking hell, the 20th century laptop is still ticking over five years after I got
it (I did manage to get freedos installed, by the way), and the only hardware
problems it has are dead speakers and battery.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
It's good to hear from you. It sounds like you are doing well.

<p>
Yes, the quality of things is just steadily going downhill. (Is it just a coincidence that it's
all made in China now?)
I am currently running two big, heavy, old Viewsonic CRT-type monitors, an E75f and an E771, right at my left elbow,
each on top of its own system,
one for Linux and one for Windoze.  They have to be at least 15 years old, if not 20, and they still work perfectly.
Four years ago, because these Viewsonic monitors are so good, I bought two brand-new flat-screen Viewsonic
monitors, and both died within two years. Like right after they went out of warranty. Go figure.
So I'm back to using the old monitors, which act like they will work perfectly for another 15 years.

</font>
<p>
I was planning on selling the laptop off for whatever money I could get and grabbing
an old (but still 21st century; 10+ lb laptops don't count as portable anymore)
thinkpad off of ebay, shaking my dad down for at least some of the money he owed me
if necessary. I wanted nothing more to do with the laptop and was willing to trade
specs for reliability.

<p>
Dad had a different idea, though.  He repaid what he owed me and got me a birthday
present at the same time. He had me pick out something to replace the laptop, and I
picked a tablet (the budget allowed for either a decent tablet or a low-end laptop).
Since this was from a Rent-A-Center type website (Dad can't afford to buy anything
up-front), Dad is gonna end up paying twice what the tablet is actually worth, and
he knows it. Now that is love.

<p>
The tablet is a Dell XPS 10. It's pretty sweet. When I was looking at tablets, I
mostly focused on finding one that had a keyboard dock (virtual keyboard won't cut
it for IRC) and was something Dad could afford. The tablets I noticed that fit that
description were Windows RT. I wasn't expecting much from the OS, but it is
surprisingly good. It's a walled garden, and not one with a vast selection of apps.

<p>
But, much like Windows 8, it has a desktop mode. Due to this being for ARM systems,
though, most native Windows programs won't run. And Microsoft only bothered porting
Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office. Jailbreak it, though, and the program
selection is better:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321215152/http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092348" target="_blank">
http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2092348</a>

<p>
Still not a particularly big selection, but very versatile. Enough to make desktop
mode useful as a laptop replacement, in my opinion. And it works well enough as a
straight tablet. I like being able to switch between tablet mode and pseudolaptop
mode. I do rather miss the Linux installation from my laptop (good software, awful
hardware), especially since I managed to get it exactly how I like it, but I might
be able to recreate at least some of it with Bochs.

<p>
But that's enough waxing about my honeymoon with the new tablet (though I doubt I
could ever loathe this thing as thoroughly as I do the laptop). In other news, I
asked my psychiatrist about drinking, and he said he wouldn't advise it. Not so much
because of my meds, but because of the reason I'm on the meds in the first place.
He's got a point. Dad still wants to buy me a drink for my birthday, though. Eh, I
probably won't finish the first drink, and he'll be there if something goes wrong. I
don't really have much reason to believe I'll develop an addiction, since I haven't
been able to stomach more than a couple of sips of the drinks I've tried.

<p>
There's more I want to write, but I just realized I've been up for nearly a full day
and my reading comprehension is shot. (What can I say? I get that way about new
electronics. And even &quot;new&quot; electronics. And I'm still elated about not needing to
use the fucking laptop. Ironic that I named it AM, yet I'm the one who feels like
using its namesake's speech on it.) Better save it for later.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Coincidentally, I just picked up a Pandigital Novel 7-inch eReader at Goodwill. It was just one of those
things. It just showed up. The box said &quot;Remanufactured&quot;, but it is in like-new condition.
Somebody else had bought it, and didn't
like it, and returned it. It was priced at $70. I waited until it went to half price and got it for $35.
Yeh, I know, a steal. Now it isn't totally great. It is the most inferior under-powered unit that Pandigital makes.
Still, it has a 500MHz Arm4 processor, and 128MB of RAM, and 4 GB of internal SD card memory. It also takes a 32GB
external SDHC card, which I immediately put in there. So it is what it is. It's worth $35, and I think it
will serve my needs until I bite the bullet and get something better. I already rooted
it, several times, with various versions of the firmware, and learned a lot about that stuff, and how to do it.
<p>
The best part of that is that I can now install all kinds of other programs (&quot;apps&quot;)
that it wasn't intended to run.
Someone figured out how to get Android 2.1 to run on it (it came with 1.5).  See:<br>

<p>
And I learned that Android is really a Java shell running on top of Linux.
It has a file explorer mode that lets me look around in there, and yes, it's Linux. 

<p>
HINT: If someone else is trying this, I learned the hard way that it will only accept a firmware update with the
same name as what is already in there. In my case it's &quot;S64N_SLSB_PDUI_PD_20110302.dat&quot;.
No other name worked. It took about 40 failed attempts to discover that.
(The date is variable. I just picked one newer than what was already in there, just in
case the machine was checking for dates.)
So no matter what firmware you want flash into the machine, rename the file to that name,
and put it on the SDHC card, and the tablet will accept it
and install it, while rejecting every other name.
Other people have to use other names, often something like &quot;polaris_update.dat&quot;
or &quot;S64N_SLST_KOBO_BB_20101104.dat&quot;.  Picky little machines.

<p>
The wifi works quite well, so I can carry it around and communicate with various wifi nodes and browse the web, and
check Gmail and whatnot, and even the visit Barnes and Noble bookstore.
My goal is to get a shell like &quot;bash&quot; and FTP and SSH
on it so that I can upload updates to the web site without always carrying around a heavy backpack with
laptop, power supply, and lots of accessories. The little tablet only weighs 1 pound.
<p>
It's getting incredible. I remember that my first computer, a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8I, had a
0.66 MHz clock (1.5 microsecond cycle time), 8 KWords of 12-bit-wide core memory,
and weighed over 100 pounds &#8212; several hundred pounds if you add in the disk
drives and tape drives and rack cabinet. And then the big Teletype terminal was over another 100 pounds. 
Now a 1-pound tablet runs 750 times faster and has 10,666 times as much memory, not counting the internal 4GB SD and
 32GB SDHC add-on card, which are like its disk drives.
Speaking of which, the PDP-8I had two 32 Kword (12-bit words) fixed-head disk drives that weighed over 50 pounds each.
<p>
Ah, the good old days.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now. Oh, and the story of the spiders is still coming. But right now I'm going to
be chasing the goslings. I saw

Hi Orange,

Subject: Another curious fact is that
<p>
Another curious fact is that the more serious addictions get the least
reverence. Most people agree smoking is the hardest thing to give up, but
many people scoff at the idea of a 12-step group for smoking.
so-called&quot;abstinence-based&quot; groups, both 12-step and not, will insist one
ought never drink to be thought &quot;clean and siober&quot; even if it never presented
any trouble, but tobacco, caffeine, chocolate and sugar (all highly
addictive) may not only be consumed but actually provided at meetings. People
often get round the first by laughing at me about the last two ignoring the
fact that morbid obesity and diabetes are major killers, just like smoking.
While not all AA/NAs may laugh at Overeaters Anonymous (though many do) since
one always has to eat OA is perhaps the one 12-step group where life
attendance makes sense, but it is the one that people will drop after the
weight loss while still attending AA/NA for life.

Those are good points. It's funny how A.A. has set itself up as the most spiritual and prestigious of
the 12-Step groups, with Al-Anon coming in second, and then the others, like Over-Eaters Anonymous and
Nicotine Anonymous and Caffeine Anonymous, are way down the totem pole and are the subject of jokes,
and like Rodney Dangerfield says, &quot;They don't get no respect.&quot;
As if drinking too much alcohol makes you much more spiritual than eating too many chocolate cakes.

Ego, ego, ego. Ah, the ego games that people play while they are &quot;reducing their egos&quot;.

Thanks.

I dunno if u remember, but I sent you an email about being in an ex-cult
rehab center b/c of my experience in the Atlantic group. The chairman of
the group this year used to be like a mom to me. Now she wants nothing to
do with me and just emailed my therapist trying to make me sound crazy and
claimed I was harassing her. It was way out of line and my therapist is
writing her back... not exactly in the way she will be expecting! Lol
I am sending a complaint about the group. I am gonna start with the GSO and
work up to a more legal chain. Have you heard of the Lifton criteria? The
UN uses it to assess whether a government is engaging in dangerous behavior.
Very popular with cult experts. I have a long form of it that makes it
easier to determine if someone is experiencing any criteria. I can send it
if you like. The Atlantic Group fits every criteria.

Hello Emily,
<p>
I'm very much interested in the work of Dr. Robert Jay Lifton. I have a lot
of admiration for him and his work. I have a short
list of his 8 Criteria for brainwashing here:<br>
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cultinfo.html#Liftons8</a>
<p>
And I have two of his books listed in the bibliography, here:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Lifton1" target="_blank"><i>Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism:
A Study of 'Brainwashing' in China</i></a>.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Lifton2" target="_blank"><i>Destroying the World to Save It, Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic
Violence, and the New Global Terrorism</i></a>
</ul>

<p>
But I don't know if I have the &quot;long form&quot; of the criteria. I'd love to get it.
<p>
Have a good day now, and welcome.

This is one of the parents of the Bald Eagle chick. I'm guessing that this is the father, and the next
picture is the mother. It's extremely subjective, but this one just looks more masculine, and more like
a father, while the next one looks more feminine. At least, to my eyes.
<p>
Notice how the father (above) has more of an outrageous mane of hair (so to speak), while the mother (below)
has more subdued plumage. That is a characteristic that is common to many bird species, and even
to lions. The male has all of the impressive plumage, and the female looks rather drab and plain
in comparison.

Whenever I hear someone say that they do not want to get rid of 12 step groups or
they claim 12 step groups are helpful for millions, I cringe a bit. I do not care if
12 step groups continue to exist or not. I do care that the truth be revealed so
that people can make informed decisions. I do believe that only an evangelical,
narcissistic, bombastic and otherwise unsuccessful person is genuinely helped by the
12 steps. They are helped by having a place to evangelize, blow their horn with
their claims of 'time,' and be able to play the big shot to vulnerable people they
refer to as 'newcomers.' This reference to these newcomers is done with pity and
disrespect, and the newcomer is broken down with mantras that break their ability to
think for themselves: 'Your best thinking got you here,' is one of many demeaning
references newcomers must adopt as truths. For that group of misfits who would
otherwise have nothing to brag about in their lives, the 12 steps are perfect.

Orange: Yes, about the bombastic fool being helped by the 12 Steps &#8212; Bill Wilson was a narcissistic personality with delusions of grandeur. When he said that all alcoholics needed to have their egos reduced, he was really talking about himself. But most alcoholics have just the opposite problem &#8212; feelings of inferiority, feeling like they are not worth much. The 12 Steps are just the opposite of what they need for therapy.

Hi Orange,
<p>
Sorry I'm just getting back to you.  I try to register on the forum last Friday
afternoon, then got busy and am just getting back to it!  I believe the user name I
was trying to use was &quot;Faith&quot;.   I am definitely legitimate and have been reading
the Orange Papers for a while.  I also am a member at the &quot;Expose AA&quot; site.  I won't
go into the long story about leaving AA, but I've been out for almost three years
now and I still get riled up about the almost 20 years in and out.  It's a common
story- I always thought something wasn't quite right, blah, blah, and finally was
triggered after a particular meeting.  I began reading AA criticism, got
&quot;deprogrammed&quot; and am happy to now live a normal life.  Interestingly, I've haven't
even had one AA &quot;friend&quot; contact me to find out where I've gone!

<p>
Keep up the good work!

Best,
