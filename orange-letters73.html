From:  	&quot;Shannon H.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	your article about the program<br>

<p>

Hello,
I just wanted to say your &quot;theories&quot; and &quot;rationalizations&quot; are ingenious.
Everything you wrote has been exactly what I've been thinking since I've been
in the program. I'm fairly new to it, so some of the things you've written
about are foreign but I think I understand anyways. Let me just explain my
story.....
<p>
I guess you could say I'm in the program both voluntarily and involuntarily.
The New York State DMV has told me after several changes of their minds, that
it'd be best for me to get an alcohol evaluation before they allow me to get
my license back. I got a DWI four years ago. I got a DWAI three years before
that. Now this automatically labels me as an alcoholic because I have no
control over alcohol because i do not think of the consequences of my
drinking.
<p>
Well, first off, I honestly, swear on everything I love, that I
don't have a problem like they think I do. Now I know all about the denial
part of the program and getting through that but I just recently admitted to
an anger problem, unrelated to alcohol, so why wouldnt I be open to admit I
have a problem with drinking. Even if it gets me through this program
quicker. They told me to participate in group meetings and AA and 12 step
meeting for twelve weeks. I have a sneaky suspicion that its gonna be alot
longer than 12 weeks.
<p>
Now, the DWAI, was a mistake. I had three drinks over an eight hour
period. Three of those eight hours were me standing in the frigid cold trying to
get my car started so I could leave the Christmas party I was at. I was so far from
intoxicated, it wasnt even funny. I passed the field sobreity tests and then the
officer wasnt satisfied to he gave me a breathelizer. It was high enough for them
to charge me with DWAI. According to my calculations, it was impossible. I have an
unbelieveable fast metabolizm as well. Come to find out, the officer wasnt trained
to give breathelizers nor had the damn thing been calibrated in a year and  a half.
So, without a doubt the test was wrong. I wanted to fight it and bring it to trial
but my defense lawyer was a golf buddy of the judge and told me that he didnt want
to upset the judge and make a mockery of his court and law enforcement colleagues
and advised me to &quot;just take the slap on the wrist&quot;. He scared me into
thinking that if it goes to trial I coulda been sent to jail for longer than I
wanted to be there.
<p>
But ya know what? No one cares about that. They just see that
I've been convicted and that's that. The DWI a few years ago, well, I haven't an
excuse except I made the best decision for the situation I was in. It happened to
be the wrong one and it's that exact reason why I haven't or have not had any need
for, urge to, or anything of that nature to want to put mysrelf in that kind of
predicament again. I dont like the feeling of being drunk, I dont like the next
mornings, I dont like the feeling of not controlling whats around me or what
happening (and you can't do that if your annebriated), the affects on my health are
less than desirable and I'm usually just downright too tired to drink beer not too
mention the fact I dont like to drink alcohol when I'm thirsty. And I'm thirsty all
the time.
<p>
My counselor said that I'm an &quot;alcoholic in remission who manages his
disease very
well&quot;. If this is the case, then why do I have to go through this program. Isn't
that what they want you to do? Isn't that what a recovering alcoholic does? Manages
his/her disease very well? Unbelieveable.
<p>
They're threatened by those who aren't
ignorant, by those who are a little educated and have common sense. A lot of what
they say are the opposite of common sense. Its just straight brain washing if you
ask me. It reminds me of my ten years in the Army. It's a do as we say, not as we
do&quot; type of thing.
<p>
But they have the upper hand. I can't get my license back any
other way. They say that they wanna make sure that I don't get behind the wheel
again drunk. That's fine but what's all this other shit have to do with it? It's like
they have every angle covered. I got a hand out of all the compulsive behaviors
that are tell-tale signs of an alcoholic and increases your chance of relapse. I
thought I was going to lose it. Working too much? Shopping too much? Internet
usage? Eating?
Cleanliness? Forming relationships? EXERCISING? Come on, what the &amp;*%#. What can
you do? Are we allowed to do anything?
<p>
I think if anything, the program causes
problems and if you didn't have a problem before, you will by the end of it all.
<p>
The
program takes up so much of your time, that before long, all of your time is spent
with those who need help that you can't give, you lose your job because you
constantly have to take time off or you're in meetings until the wee hours of the
night, then you go into debt, you lose your family, and before you know it, you're
just like most of these guys except for the alcohol addiction. That soon changes
and then the next place you find yourself in is the halfway house with the others
and now the program has full control over you and you are now property basically.
<p>
It takes years and years for you to get your life back. But they have an answer for
EVERYTHING! Just like those of us who are in denial. So who's right and who's
wrong? I have
half a mind to just roll with the punches and tell them what they want to hear but
half of me doesn't want to oblige them like that. I don't feel I need to be in this
program and I'm afraid with my attitude, it'll keep me in this program for a long
time.
<p>
I haven't driven in three years, haven't drank more than two beers in any one
sitting in just as long of time. I have complete control and always have. I've been
that person who can drink one beer and that's it. I've been that person who doesn't
drink at all. I've never been that person who's gotten belligerantly drunk,
repeated drunken driver, pissing on myself, spilling beer and stumbling home, black
out-can't remember what happened the night before drunk. NEVER! I'm a social drinker
who's gotten drunk his fair share but has only once compromised his safety and the
safety of others and has never let it get the best of me before or since then. I
have way too much to lose and nothing to gain from this behavior. So, what do you
suggest? Any help would be appreciated

<p>

Shannon

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Shannon,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and your story. I wish I had an easy answer for you, but I don't.
<p>
The best that I can suggest is to just go through &quot;the program&quot;, even as stupid and insane as it is,
because that's all that you can do. Then, once you are through with them, you can write and speak
to expose the truth. Get your revenge that way. You should also write to your politicians &#8212; Senators
and Congressmen and opposing candidates &#8212; especially right now before the election,
when they might actually care about what you thinking (for a few more weeks).
<p>
And remember that you are not alone. A lot of people are going through the same bullshit.
Sooner or later, the truth will out. We can do this.
<p>
And in the mean time, try to have a good day anyway.

Dear Sir:

<p>

I thought perhaps as you seem very concerned with the truth and as
far as I can see, there is only one truth and lots of opinion, the
above link. If it of value, I hope you enjoy it.

<p>

Best wishes ...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Drew,
<p>
Thanks for the link. Yes, I like that essay. Michael put a lot of work into research, ferretting
out the truth about that misquote that Ray Campbell and Bill Wilson mistakenly attributed
to Sir Herbert Spencer.
<p>
And the thing that I find really interesting is that it sounds like something that
Sir Herbert Spencer could have said.
But he didn't.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:        AA as Cult<br>

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
I'm a social work student doing research on AA, positive and negatives. I
had a look at your web cite and have a couple of questions for you:

<p>
1)    In &quot;Alcoholics anonymous as cult, scorecard, answers. . .&quot; you list
the elements of a cult and analyse AA from this             framework. I
can't find the source for your list. Without a &quot;legitimate&quot; source, I
can't really use your analysis. I'd appreciate it if you would provide a
reference.

<p>
2)     I'd be interested in learning who you are, and what your
credentials are.

<p>
Much appreciated

<p>
-Robin

Hello, Robin,
<p>
I listed some of the sources for the cult test on the introduction
web page:<br> 
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult.html">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-cult.html</a>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;And then there is this list of cult characteristics, which I have
assembled from a wide variety of sources &#8212; books and magazine articles
on cults, other people's descriptions of cults, and my own personal
experiences with cults. It incorporates the ideas of Lifton, Singer,
Schein, Hassan, and many others.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
In addition, I assembled the list of cult characteristics myself
by studying a lot of other cults, which are listed on that page.

<p>
Each of the questions in the test gives examples of that particular
behavior in other cults.

<p>

dropped out of Berkeley in 1966 when I changed my major to LSD.

Date:  	Wed, September 20, 2006 1:06 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Mike B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Saved How Many Lives?!!!<br>

<p>

Hey, Again,
<p>
Glad to see you have been enjoying your summer.  I just sat here for about
three minutes and came up with some names.  Here they are &#8212; Keith, Phil
H., Linda Kay H., Millie B., Judy G., Gloria C., Danny M., Dale R., Gary B.,
Dean H., Dean G., and my cousin Jeanann B.  These are all long-term AA members
who traded years of life because they followed the suggestions of the Big
Book of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS as outlined on page 135 and frankly just never
really felt like giving up their less-serious ailment of smoking, and died
from smoking-related illnesses.  To these names I could, but won't add three
more who will soon join their comrades in recovery.
<p>
Now, let me think... my cousin, Don B. (Jeanann's brother), Gary B., and, gee,
not counting a couple suicides, that is about it for people I have known from
the rooms who actually died from drug and alcohol use.
<p>
Now, let's see if I can come up with an equal or greater number of folks I
know here in town with 25-year coins... Nope, the dead smokers are the
majority.
<p>
I would invite all the Big Book-thumping AA Nazis to conduct the same survey
in their own little realms.  What the heck, make it 15 years instead of 25.
Dead smokers will still be in the majority, I bet.
<p>
In my 25 years of listening (or not) to AA and NA leads, I have only ever
heard one person say that you should quit smoking if you are going to set a
positive example to those people you are trying to talk to about addictions.
<p>
Me (I never heard Orange lead).
<p>
Does anyone out there know PERSONALLY of anyone who has actually had a
nicotine-withdrawal-induced alcoholic relapse? Me, either.
<p>
I'm thinking
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">page 135 of the Big Book</a>
has actually killed more drunks than the other 163 pages have hypothetically saved.
<p>
Later,<br>
Mike B.<br>
Marion, Ohio<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. That is all just so true. The death toll from tobacco is
just staggering. It's monumental. It's like crashing a fully loaded Boeing 767 jet airliner
into the ground every single day of the year, including Christmas.
(And that's just in the USA.)

<p>
To ignore the tobacco deaths is just plain stupid. (And a great example of minimization and denial.)
<p>
One thing that so many A.A. members seem to be ignoring is: Lots of people drink to kill the pain
of how bad they feel because they are so sick from smoking tobacco.
It is lots, LOTS, easier for me to stay sober now that I don't smoke. There isn't any giant depressing
sick-to-death feeling to mask or drown.
<p>
I think that deciding to also quit smoking, as well as quit drinking, is almost certainly
the smartest, wisest decision I have made in the last 7 years. Maybe even more important than deciding
to quit drinking, because tobacco also causes drinking.

<p>
And yet, I got a lot of this routine from 12-Stepper &quot;counselors&quot;:<br>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Don't put too much on your plate, or something might spill off.<br>
Don't bite off more than you can chew. Just concentrate on your recovery.&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
Fortunately, I ignored them and followed my own conscience. (And my own guts, which were definitely of
the opinion that they didn't want any more tobacco.)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. (And it sure is easier to have a good day when you can breathe,
and your chest doesn't hurt, isn't it?)

<p>

I don't know who you are, but you cannot possibly grasp the
spiritual basis of AA and have written what you have about
AA as a cult. The hogwash you write in comparing AA to a
cult is dangerous.  I have 24 years of continuous sobriety &#8212;
I am clearheaded, more in control of my life than ever, at
peace and in harmony with all the people in my life.  You
have done a great disservice in putting this vile stuff up

Hello Pierrette,
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">fails to cure alcoholics,
and then lies about it</a>. How spiritual is that?

<p>
A.A. has even been shown to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">increase the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
So what part of the spirituality do I not understand?
Is the real goal of Alcoholics Anonymous just to get the alcoholics into Heaven sooner?

<p>
You have 24 years of sobriety and feel clear-headed because you have chosen to abstain from drinking alcohol
for the last 24 years, not because you love a cult religion.

<p>
What is dangerous to alcoholics is foisting completely ineffective quackery on sick people and
telling them that it is the best thing &#8212; the only program that really works.
<p>
Oh, and I like your repetition of the standard A.A. line about how telling the truth about
Alcoholics Anonymous is &quot;doing a great disservice to alcoholics&quot;. I've heard the same line
so many times, from so many parrots:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters.html#disservice">You are doing a real dis-service...</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#great_disservice">I am afraid you
are doing a great injustice to society by maintaining your website.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice">Your &quot;online book&quot;
does a great disservice to those looking for an answer.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#disservice2">My dog demonstrates more care
and responsibility than you do.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters46.html#disservice">...can keep people who
need real help from finding it...</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters48.html#irresponsible">...please try to be
more responsible in espousing your version of the truth, it could prove
deadly to someone.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters54.html#disservice">I feel you are doing
AA a dis-service for those who CHOOSE to try it, like I did.</a>

</ul>

<p>

No, that isn't it. I did meet some objectionable characters, but what really matters to me is

I actually did click around a bit and all I hear are angry,
illogical statements (supported by weak research) by you
that in fact only highlight in relief the opposite &#8212; AA's
philosophy of love, tolerance, and acceptance.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Weak research? No,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">I have the best research available</a>.
 It is Alcoholics Anonymous that
uses weak research, and rigged &quot;studies&quot;, and outright lies to promote its program.
</font>
<p>
  For example,
sure there are some who think that AA is the only answer (my
sponsor is one of them who happens to have 33 years of
sobriety), but my sponsor also honors and respects that we
are ALL being lead by a higher power and that this entity of
love will direct my path, not her.  I could respond to many,
many (perhaps even all) of your statements.  But one keeps
staying with me.  Yes, AA is a spiritual program. Why does
that bother you so badly?
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is not a spiritual program.
A.A. is a superstitious program.
There is nothing spiritual about lying to sick people about
how well a suggested treatment works.
A.A. begins every meeting by reciting lists of Bill Wilson's lies from pages 58 through
60 of the <i>Big Book</i>,
like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;</font>,
which is intended to fool the newcomers into thinking that the A.A. program actually works,
which it doesn't.

<p>
The 12 Steps are not &quot;spiritual&quot; &#8212; they are
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">the cult recruiting practices of Dr. Frank Nathan
Daniel Buchman</a>.
</font>
<p>

  Anyone with a brain and a heart
and a soul can gradually discern the distinction between a
science and a spirituality &#8212; I am not confused about the two
and I don't know anyone in AA who feels that AA is passing
itself off as a psuedo-science.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You don't know? Well let me enlighten you. Read these articles:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-spirrecov.html">A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>Spirituality: The key to recovery from alcoholism</i></a><br>

<li> <a href="orange-pseudo2.html">More A.A.-Booster Pseudo-Science: <i>The Spiritual Dimension of Healing</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-big_lie.html#Renascent">The Renascent Treatment Center's propaganda</a>
<li> <a href="orange-Galanter.html">More A.A.-Booster Propaganda: the book
<i>Cults: Faith, Healing, and Coercion</i>, by Marc Galanter</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys">The Humphreys-Moos faked studies at the Palo Alto Veteran's Center</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2">more from Rudolf H. Moos</a>
</ol>
<p>
There is a regular A.A. propaganda mill just cranking out those phony pseudo-science articles by the dozens,
just some more pro-A.A. publicity that has the goal of
keeping the flow of tax dollars into the 12-Step-based treatment centers, and ensuring
the flow of sentenced newcomers coming into the A.A. meetings.
</font>
<p>
Finally, AA does not hide
the fact that it's statistics are poor; why should that keep
all of us from trying to get and stay sober?  And if AA
helps even %5, isn't it worth it?
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. does not even score 5%. The apparent 5% success rate at the one-year point is just normal
spontaneous remission. That is the success rate of people who quit on their own.
A.A. cannot claim that it saved those people. When you subtract the people who would have quit anyway
from the apparent A.A. success rate, you get:
Five minus five equals zero. That is the real A.A. achievement &#8212; no additional sobriety.
And that was even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
verified by a doctor who is a member of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.</a> &#8212; Dr. and Prof. George E. Vaillant.
<p>
Oh, and that's some of that solid research that you were wishing for &#8212; really good, solid
long-term research done by a man who is both a doctor and a professor of psychology at Harvard University.
And he just loves A.A. and he thinks that everybody should get shoved into A.A., even though
A.A. does not work and it just raises the death rate. He said that.
</font>
<p>
  I am one of those who
believed that if I followed the guidelines I would get and
stay sober and I have.  This is my only response to this
statistic.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You may have <i>believed</i> that, but that does not make it true.
<p>
You are assuming a cause and effect relationship between working the A.A. program and quitting drinking.
There is no evidence to support that belief. The real evidence says that people quit when they wish to.
When they get tired of suffering, then they decide to quit drinking. And in your case, you then also
decided to join a cult and follow their program. And to become a true believer.
</font>
<p>
  But I don't know anyone who really believes that
AA is the only way &#8212; not even my sponsor &#8212; just the way that
worked for them.  One of the greatest principles of AA is
&quot;take what you like, and leave the rest.&quot;  Sometimes I take
more, sometimes less &#8212; I have a great mind now, thanks to
sobriety and AA, and I now have the ability to choose the
direction of my own life &#8212; this is the 12th step in action.
I also have a great sense of self, so I distinguish between
a safe environment and one that is not.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hmmm. The 12th Step says,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Go recruiting for fresh meat (carry the message to alcoholics), and also
practice these principles in all of our affairs.&quot;
</font>
<p>
But there are no spiritual principles in the 12 Steps.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">The 12 Steps are Buchmanite cult <i>PRACTICES</i></a>, not
spiritual principles.
Doing Buchman's practices does not improve people's lives.
<p>
Now I agree that your life was improved by sobriety. When you stop poisoning yourself with alcohol,
your life usually gets much better.

I'm so sorry that you came across a few very flawed people.

Hello Paul,
<p>
In looking back through my email, I realize that I never answered your reply.
<p>
My definition of &quot;truth&quot; is the same one as in the dictionary:

<blockquote>
<font color="black">
<pre>
Truth \Truth\, n.; pl. {Truths}. [OE. treuthe, trouthe, treowpe,
   AS. tre['o]w?. See {True}; cf. {Troth}, {Betroth}.]
   1. The quality or being true; as:
      (a) Conformity to fact or reality; exact accordance with
          that which is, or has been; or shall be.
          [1913 Webster]
      (b) Conformity to rule; exactness; close correspondence
          with an example, mood, object of imitation, or the
          like.
          [1913 Webster]
</pre>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now other people use other definitions. Scientology uses the definition that whatever furthers the
cause of the Scientology cult is &quot;truth&quot;, and when you tell true facts about the negative side
of Scientology, that is a &quot;lie&quot;.
<p>
What definition of &quot;truth&quot; are you using for Alcoholics Anonymous?
<p>
Have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	thanks for the info<br>

<p>

Hello Orange,
<p>
I appreciate your trip through Buchmanism.  I had heard about that connection a
while ago and at the time I was suprised that anything as &quot;democratic&quot; and
loose-knit and non-dogmatic as AA could be linked with fascism.  In it's infancy,
recovered drunks even argued strenuously about the inclusion or exclusion of God or
&quot;God&quot; in their book and meetings.  Some thought it better to present a fellowship
with social attraction, and spring the &quot;God-thing&quot; later.  Others felt the far
opposite, but there was some sort of a compromise and I guess it was decided that it
would be dishonest and trickery to omit &quot;God&quot; completely.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi GG,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, historically, A.A. members have been on both sides of the fence on that issue.
But Jim Burwell, the village atheist, finally got converted and became a true believer.
</font>
<p>

Compared to typical religion, it's hard to be less dogmatic than &quot;God as we
understood Him&quot;, meaning of course individual choice and open searching, IMO.  As a
matter of fact, some of the evangelical Christian rightwingnuts in America see AA as
some Satanic apostasy due to the &quot;God as you understand Him&quot; clause and reliance on
meditation instead of Biblical authority.  (There are some potential risks with &quot;God
as you understand Him&quot; &#8212; God could be a neighbor's dog telling you to kill people
 &#8212; but there's a general understanding of a Spirit which is Good and Unselfish and
Forgiving ... and we all need a sense of forgiveness.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Part of the undogmatic freedom of religion is merely
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html##re_education">a bait-and-switch trick</a>, you know.
You can't really have just any Higher Power you want. Bedpan Almighty as I understand Him, for instance,
does not help people to quit drinking, not ever. He likes people pissing more.

</font>
<p>

I personally am a member of AA in good standing, i.e. sober 19 years.  I too found
AA very hokey at some points.  Sober dances in Detroit with slick DJs were pretty
cool, but sober dances in Akron have a tendency towards schmaltz or frat party or
country bowling night.  I certainly appreciated ICYPAA in New York City with some
top NY House Music DJs.  Different cultures projected within AA.

<p>

(Oddly, some complained it was like a bar scene ... so what ... I loved some of the
hipper bar scenes ... it was just the chemical cocktail in my bloodstream that
wasn't working.)

<p>

Some members I know would seem to do well in the MRA scene, very much into rules and
authoritarianism.  I argued with one about asking people to leave &quot;closed meetings&quot;
if they were non-alcoholic, &quot;you have to go&quot;, vs. letting them stay and explaining
to them afterwards, with politeness and concern, the reason and purpose for closed
meetings.  This guy was putting rules ahead of principles of compassion and
&quot;charity&quot; i.e. helping another person and making them feel welcome.

<p>

Myself, if I had not been exposed to Taoism and other more reality-rooted viewpoints
(and hallucinogens) in my youth, I might not have been able to mentally translate
the written AA into something I could live with, a little bit of God, a little bit
of Jesus, a little bit of Tao, a little bit of punk and rock poetry, a little bit of
pop culture rhetoric where it fits.

<p>

I never had to &quot;give up&quot; on intellect, though I did have to try to give up my
internal arguments, give it a rest, put &quot;Reason&quot; on the back burner for a while.
Some imply that Reason or Thinking is bad, but it was just that my logic was tainted
with too much illogic and emotionally-driven conclusions, self-deception, fear.
After a time, I was able to slide back into Reason and Logic with more confidence,
and even be able to develop my logic and reason to a higher degree.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What? If your logic was &quot;tainted&quot;, then it wasn't logic. Stopping thinking is not the cure for
bad logic.
<p>
You know, what you are describing is one of the classic text-book characteristics of a mind-controlling
cult:
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind">67. Don't Trust Your Own Mind</a>.
They taught you not to trust your own thinking.
<p>
Now that is not to be confused with the yammering and complaining of
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">the Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>
as it demands its creature comforts. But that little's toad's jabber
is not &quot;your thinking&quot; &#8212; it is merely the wheedling of a stupid little
animal that wants to feel good.
<p>
And of course you also got
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers">90. Newcomers Need Fixing</a>.
That one is tricky, because of course you really did need to quit drinking and recover your health.
But what the cult wants to fix in you is other things, like your &quot;spirituality&quot;
and your &quot;faith&quot;, which has nothing to do with quitting drinking.

</font>
<p>

I think it's possible that AA was rescued in some ways by the inclusion of hippies
and alcoholic drug users, towards some useful shifts in culture towards inclusivity
and harmony.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Rescued? I think A.A. is over the hill and will eventually die out.
</font>
<p>

I think that Hitler and Fascism has very little to do with modern AA (at least where
I live).  I wish I could say the same thing about Herr President Bush's Nazi past
... but that chain of fascism is very much alive.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Current A.A. does not worship Hitler or the Nazis, but a lot of the religious dogma is still

<p>

Dude,
<p>
you really over exaggerate

<p>

As for the 'Bedpan Almighty', certainly while the bait and switch is to &quot;God&quot;, that
&quot;God&quot; remains undefined.  Some go all whacked out on Christianity.  Some become (or
remain) nominal Christians as are many Americans.  Christmas, etc.  Some prefer
other religions or explore Taoism which is like a religion with no gods.
I'm not saying there's no &quot;God&quot; in AA, it's just not heavy handed, least heavy
handed compared to any ordinary church or synagogue.

<p>

As for needing spiritual uplift, with myself as the judge of my own condition, I
needed to be able to 'let go' of my ego. I didn't understand that, but later on I
was able to see parallels between that concept of 'letting go' in hippie terms,
gettin' in the groove, etc.  Nowadays, some young people 'let go' on House Music,
with or without Ecstasy at some raves.  To me, the spiritual dimension of AA was one
other way to describe the same territory, and a method to get there without having
to be
<ul>
<li>
a) dancing
<li>
b) drinking
<li>
c) tweaking or spacing on any drugs
<li>
d) listening to Led Zeppelin.
</ul>
<p>
Hence, something you can do at work or any time.

<p>

Given my condition, this went far beyond the mere animal brain seeking comfort.  I
know myself, and I understand what was wrong with me, in retrospect, and a
personality change 'at depth' was needed.  My personality was fear-based and wired
to need alcohol to cope with being with myself.
I'm very glad I got my head 'shrunk' via the AA process rather than some
professional 'shrink'.  I remained an active participant, I got independence, I
didn't need to submit to any medication routine, nor submit my deepest secrets to
someone who had the authority to lock me up.

<p>

I personally am not a 'heavy' in any AA dogma.  I hardly know anyone who is, some
more than others.  Maybe in some parts of the country.  People have a tendency to
get obsessive about things, but that's people.

<p>

I'm too lazy to debate further, and I'm sure you're happy with your little gig, so
enjoy it.  I'm just not convinced that AA is some corrosive or destructive cult.  I
am slightly convinced that some people take the passivity of live and let live a
little to literally, considering serious stuff like From Freedom to Fascism, but
plenty of non-AA non-religious people are equally passive.

Date:  	Fri, September 22, 2006 10:01 am<br>
From:  	&quot;Andy M.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Dear Orange,<br>

<p>

Since first coming across your site about a month ago, I have read it all with great
interest.  I was familiar with some of the murky backround of Frank Buchman and his
Oxford Group Movement a.k.a. Moral Rearmament, but I had no idea that his sympathies
with Fascism went as far as your researches clearly indicate they did. I have
actually owned and read one of the ghastly sycophantic  biographies of Buchman by
Garth Lean.  I'm pretty sure it was the
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot930.html">Tail of a Comet</a>&quot;
one.  It had me laughing
out loud in places, a masterpiece of pompous unintentional humour.  I seem to
remember that it quoted letters written home to his mother from the seminary by
Buchman saying things along the lines of &quot;Dear Mummy, I have a divinely ordained
mission to save the world.  Please send me more money so that I can keep up the good
work.&quot; I must confess that I have also laughed out loud at the awful, corny and
pretentious verbiage that comprises AA &quot;literature&quot;, most especially those cloyingly
unctuous homilies in &quot;As Bill Sees It&quot;.

<p>

I grew up in the UK and still live here, so I actually live in the country where
the Oxford Group phenomenon had its greatest successes, but it is interesting that
today it is virtually unheard of here except by the minority of AA members who
bother to look into the history of the fellowship. Oxford Group ideas and
practices only  survive in AA, and their true nature and origin is rarely
understood by the people exposed to them. If they really understood that the
beliefs and practices which they are encouraged to subscribe to had their origin
with a crackpot heretic preacher with strange occult beliefs, serious sexual
hang-ups and an unashamed admiration for Adolf Hitler, I am sure that they would
think twice, but of course newcomers to AA are not honestly and fairly apprised of
the relevant facts.

<p>

Although Buchman and the Oxford Group are probably virtually unheard of here today
by people too young to remember the Second World War, I well remember that my late
father recalled clearly the great shock and controversy caused by Buchman's
praise of Hitler, when I asked him a few years ago if he was familiar with
Buchman's religious movement.  He also remembered and despised the Quisling
behaviour of those Oxford Groupers who dodged the draft.

<p>

Of course, it is next to impossible to discuss any of the matters you discuss or
any reasonable doubts or misgivings concerning the received untruths purveyed by
AA within the context of an AA meeting, although I do occasionally show up at a
meeting and express my point of view.  It makes me as popular as a fart in an
elevator, but I am past caring what believers in the 12 steps think about me, and
who knows, a newcomer might even get a little bit of hope from someone saying from
personal experience that it is entirely possible for someone with an alcohol
problem to stay sober without subscribing to an occult belief system.

<p>

Finally, I would like to thank you for giving me some badly needed hope when I was
feeling very low and embattled as a result of the attitudes of step-Nazis. I have
what some people term a dual diagnosis, in that I am bipolar as well as alcoholic,
and of course some shit-heads around AA rooms are not above making malicious use
of their knowledge of this to try to upset or compomise me. Consequently I have to
be very judicious about showing up at meetings and saying outspoken things .

<p>

Anyway, thank you so much for all the work you have done. I can't say how much it
means to know that there are other thinking and feeling people who see through
this awful attempt at mind-control and spiritual fascism.  Though your site I
discovered and read the work of various other people with broadly similar views,
and it has given me a great deal of hope.

<p>

All the best,<br>
keep up the good work,<br>
Andy<br>

From:  	Egretqueen<br>
Subject:  	what about the anger thing?<br>

<p>

The 12 step people insist that anger is an inevitable way to return to
drinking. This is a SERIOUS flaw in the AA cult-like rhetoric.  Anger is a part of
being human, and this group of converts are asking us to give up so much of
our humanity.

<p>

There is no doubt that life is unfair, and drinking excesively makes
everything worse. However, asking a woman to not be pissed off at an abusive
situation, or anyone who has been victimized, is insane, as far as I'm concerned.
I was sober for 20 years, I went to NA and AA regularly for 10 (or more) of
those years.

<p>

I gave up on all of it , and now I am drinking alcoholically again. I dread
going back to AA. I always had a mind of my own during the years in AA ans NA,
and I swear the people thought a bolt of lightning would smite me every time I
critisized the &quot;progam&quot;. I specifically looked at the 12 step thing from a
feminist point of view, and I guess that was not to the liking of (especially)
male members of the group.

<p>

Anyway, I need to stop drinking. I have several chronic illnesses, which led
me to drink in the first place. I controlled it for a long time, but i have
become uncomfortable in the amount I drink. Some of what I learned in AA was
true, some not. But I just want to stop without listening to the constant
reiteration of the 12 step philosophy (or, as you say, &quot;cult&quot;)

<p>

Thanks for reading this<br>

<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>
I would just like to thank you for your replies and generous use of your
time. You appear to be an enourmously talented researcher and writer, which I
might be had been if I had not become ill and also had courage that you have.

<p>

I deeply appreciate you and your emails. I do have doctors; too many, in
fact. but the balance between pain management and addiction is precarious. My
friends and I, who began recovery in the 12 step groups over 20 years ago, are
aging and fighting to maintain sobriety. I said to hell with it and began to
drink. Life of suffering became not so different, sober or not.

<p>

Anyway, thank you from the recesses of soul,<br>
Lisa

Hi again Lisa,
<p>
Thanks again for all of the compliments. Sorry to take so long to answer this letter; I've been
way backlogged in answering email.
<p>
I hope you are feeling better. May I suggest finding your own path somehow? Obviously you are not
happy with the 12-Step routine, and it isn't doing you any good. But you don't have to drink because
A.A. is a failure.

<p>
I appreciate your remark about the difficulty of balancing pain management with avoiding addiction.
That is a terribly difficult tightrope to walk, and you are performing without a net.
Still, it seems like you don't have to despair and resign yourself to drinking
too much just because you can't totally
abstain. You might be happier if you could find some middle ground or middle path somewhere.
That's just a suggestion, not a guaranteed cure-all solution.

<p>
Take care of yourself, and have a good day.

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;In the early days our failures were legion&quot;


So, on this late Fall afternoon in 1937, Smithy and I were talking together
in his living room, Anne sitting there when we began to count
noses. How many people had stayed dry; in Akron, in New York, maybe
a few in Cleveland? How many had stayed dry and for how long?
And when we added up the total, it sure was a handful of, I don't know,
35, 40 maybe. But enough time had elapsed on enough really fatal cases
of alcoholism, so that we grasped the importance of these small statistics.
Bob and I saw for the first time that this thing was going to succeed.
That God in His providence and mercy had thrown a new light into the
dark caves where we and our kind had been and were still dwelling by
the millions. I never can forget the elation and ecstasy that seized us
both. And then we sat happily talking and reflecting. We reflected that
well, a couple of score of drunks were sober but this had taken three long
years. There had been an immense amount of failure and a long time
had been taken just to sober up the handful.

I think this has been rephrased in another of Bills writings.. (In the
early days for every person who got sober,) &quot;Our failures were leigon&quot;

It might be in <i>AA comes of age</i>, their noble struggle bullshit...

Yes, Bill Wilson had an outrageous case of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">delusions of grandeur</a>.
<p>
I know of a very similar quote, just rephrased a little.
In his history of Alcoholics Anonymous (AACOA), Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It was on a November day in that year [1937] when Dr. Bob and I sat in his living room,
counting the noses of our recoveries.
There had been failures galore, but now we could see some startling successes too.
A hard core of very grim, last-gasp cases had by then been sober a couple of years,
an unheard-of development.
There were twenty or more such people.
All told we figured that upwards of forty alcoholics were staying
bone dry.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As we carefully rechecked this score, it suddenly burst upon us that a
new light was shining into the dark world of the alcoholic. Despite the
fact that
<a href="orange-letters10.html#Ebby">Ebby had slipped</a>,
a benign chain reaction, one alcoholic carrying
the good news to the next, had started outward from Doctor Bob and me.
Conceivably it could one day circle the whole world. What a tremendous thing
that realization was! At last we were sure. There would be no more flying totally
blind. We actually wept for joy, and Bob and Anne and I bowed our heads
in silent thanks.<br>

So, after two years of intense full-time recruiting work (while his wife Lois worked in
a department store to support him), including
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">deceptive recruiting</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#early_coercion">coercive recruiting</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">cherry-picking</a>
only those alcoholics who were ready to quit drinking,
Bill and Bob counted 40 ex-drinkers in their club (who had anything from two years
down to a few days of sobriety).
On the basis of that, Bill Wilson concluded that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery">he had discovered
a new cure for alcoholism</a> that would sweep the world.

<p>
Bill Wilson was literally delusional.

Yeah the bullshit contrast.... this came up in the searching.

It was on a November day in that year [1937] when Dr. Bob and I sat in his living room,
He had three visitors. After a bit, he said: &quot;The way you fellows put this
spiritual stuff makes sense. I'm ready to do business. I guess the old
folks were
right after all.&quot; So one more was added to the Fellowship.
All this time our friend of the hotel lobby incident remained in that
town. He
was there three months. He now returned home, leaving behind his first
acquaintance,
the lawyer, and the devil-may-care chap. These men had found
something brand new in life. Though they knew they must help other
alcoholics
if they would remain sober, that motive became secondary. It was transcended
by the happiness they found in giving themselves for others. They
shared their homes, their slender resources, and gladly devoted their
spare hours
to fellow-sufferers. They were willing, by day or night, to place a new
man in
the hospital and visit him afterward. They grew in numbers. They experienced
a few distressing failures, but in those cases, they made an effort to
bring the
man's family into a spiritual way of living, thus relieving much worry and
suffering.<br>

A member gives us a vivid glimpse of those days.  &quot;At one time,&quot; he says,
&quot;every A.A. group had many membership rules.  Everybody was scared
witless that
something or somebody would capsize the boat and dump us all back into the
drink.  Our Foundation office* asked each group to send in its list of
'protective' regulations.  The total list was a mile long.  If all those
rules
had been in effect everywhere, nobody could have possibly joined A.A. at
all,
so great was the sum of our anxiety and fear.<br>
<hr>
*In 1954, the name of the Alcoholic Foundation, Inc., was changed
to the
General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous, Inc., and the Foundation
office
is now the General Service Office.<br>
<hr>

&quot;We were resolved to admit nobody to A.A. but that
hypothetical class of
people we termed `pure alcoholics.'  Except for their guzzling, and the
unfortunate results thereof, they could have no other complications.  so
beggars, tramps, asylum inmates, prisoners, queers, plain crackpots, and
fallen
women were definitely out.  Yes sir, we'd cater only to pure and respectable
alcoholics!  Any others would surely destroy us.  Besides, if we took in
those
odd ones, what would decent people say about us?  We built a fine-mesh fence
right around A.A.<br>
&quot;Maybe this sounds comical now.  Maybe you think we
oldtimers were pretty
intolerant.  But I can tell you there was nothing funny about the situation
then.  We were grim because we felt our lives and homes were threatened, and
that was no laughing matter.  Intolerant, you say?  Well, we were
frightened.<br>
Naturally, we began to act like most everybody does when afraid.  After all,
isn't fear the true basis of intolerance?  Yes, we were intolerant.&quot;<br>

<h2>The Saddest Day In A.A. History</h2>

<p>

The history of Alcoholics Anonymous is constantly being made. Events
that happen today comprise a page in the overall picture that future
generations of alcoholics who seek A.A.'s help will eventually read.
Recent events, sad to say, are part of the darkest days in A.A.'s future
history.

<p>

* A member of Alcoholics Anonymous in Germany, a brother in recovery,
has been attacked by the very organization espousing spiritual
principles &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous. *

<p>

As a student of the history of Alcoholics Anonymous for the past 18
years, and in almost 23 years of sobriety, this writer is having a
difficult time reconciling what A.A. has stood for in his own personal
recovery journey with recent actions. These actions taken and endorsed
by the General Service structure of Alcoholics Anonymous worldwide have
disturbed this writer to the point of questioning his own continuing
membership in this fellowship.

<p>

This writer has believed that the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions
stood for a way of life, based upon rigorous honesty and spiritual
principles. However, recent events brought to light have caused personal
questioning of the actual validity and placing into practice of these
principles.

<p>

A member of Alcoholics Anonymous in Germany, a brother in recovery, has
been attacked by the very organization espousing spiritual principles &#8212;
Alcoholics Anonymous. This brother has been vilified and ostracized by
Alcoholics Anonymous to the extent that his membership and personal
continued sobriety could be in jeopardy. All in the name of unity, but
in reality, due to problems relating to money and property.

(What you mean he is so brainwashed that he can't think for himself...
Actually Mitchells whining is probably true.)

<p>
Mitchell is a wanker anyway.

<p>
<font color="blue">
In defense of Mitchell, I have to say that he tells the truth, which is very unusual
for an A.A. publicist. I like him just for that.
(In fact, Mitchell K. and Dick B. are <i>the only two</i> A.A. members that I know of who consistently
tell the truth while writing about Alcoholics Anonymous.)

Some pointless but interesting stuff.

<p>
gallon (gal) [1]<br>
a traditional unit of liquid volume, derived from the Roman galeta,
which originally meant a pailful. Gallons of various sizes have been
used in Europe ever since Roman times. In the United States, the gallon
is legally defined as exactly 231 cubic inches; this is equal to the old
English wine gallon, standardized during the reign of Queen Anne in
1707. The U. S. gallon holds 4 liquid quarts or exactly 3.785 411 784
liters. American colonists were also familiar with an older unit, the
Elizabethan beer and ale gallon, which held 282 cubic inches (4.621
liters).

<p>

gallon (gal) [2]<br>
a traditional unit of dry volume. The U. S. dry gallon is 1/2 peck, or 4
dry quarts, or 268.8025 cubic inches, or approximately 4.404 884 liters.
This unit is the English corn or grain gallon, standardized during the
reign of Elizabeth I in the sixteenth century. The earliest official
definition of a dry gallon in Britain is a 1303 proclamation of Edward
I, where the gallon is defined as the volume of 8 pounds of wheat; the
current U.S. gallon contains about 7.5 pounds of wheat.

<p>

gallon (gal) [3]<br>
currently the British use a larger gallon than either of the American
gallons. The Imperial Weights and Measures Act of 1824 established a new
unit for all volumes, liquid or dry, replacing all the other gallons in
previous use in Britain. The imperial gallon, designed to contain
exactly 10 pounds of distilled water under precisely defined conditions,
holds exactly 4.546 09 liters or approximately 277.4194 cubic inches.
The imperial gallon equals 1.20095 U.S. liquid gallons or 1.03206 U.S.
dry gallon.
