Hi again Orange

<p>
I'm a bit late replying but I'm catching up on my OP letters reading. In reply to
<a href="orange-letters272.html#CJ" target="_blank">CJ  &quot;AA Horror Story&quot; posted Nov 5th</a>,
 forget your injured pride, we all fell for the
AA bull shit, you survived, many didn't, including two friends of mine one of whom is
an AA suicide and I think it truly great of you to go to meetings to protect
newcomers and I also think its a duty more of us could do with performing.

<p>
I also  choose to moderate alcohol while abstaining from cigarettes and cocaine,
but as you say &quot;no one needs to have their psyches interfered with by a cult.&quot; I
truly wish you very best for the future my friend.

<p>
In reply to
<a href="orange-letters272.html#Martin D" target="_blank">Martin D again posted Nov 5th</a>,
 I get tired of hearing how many years you
old time recovery gurus have been abstinent from Alcohol. (Whether you have founded a
&quot;recovery home&quot; or are opposed to the disease lie or not.)  47 years at first
sounds impressive, especially to vulnerable AA newcomers.  But you people never say
how long you were actually drinking for.  47 years abstinent, correct me if I'm
wrong the legal drinking age in the US is 21, that doesn't leave much time for
problem drinking unless you are 100 years old or so. In which case my hat is off to
you if you also manged to keep working till you were 89 years old.

<p>
Did you actually have much of  a drinking problem in the first place or are you just
another old timer stepper bull shitter who is in love with his own self-obsessed
importance and thrives on continual boasting to the gullible newcomers down at the
local cult indoctrination session? I would never grace an AA (or AA front group)
gathering with the name &quot;meeting&quot; that implies intelligent discussion and
argument as opposed to repetitive brain washing cult garbage.

<p>
To the rest of you stepper zombies who continually have a go at Orange.  Terry is by
no means the only person who despises your disgusting satanic cult, which thrives on
fear, lies, misinformation and manipulation and sexual exploitation of the
vulnerable.  Terry just has much more of a sense of honour and duty than the rest of
us silent majority, and is prepared to go the extra mile to expose this 12 step
thing for the true evil it is.

<p>
Best again Orange and have a great day

You can tell that she is begging for bread, rather than threatening to kill me, by how she is hissing.
She has her mouth wide open and her tongue is out, and she is hissing softly. When geese are threatening
to attack, their mouths are nearly closed  &#8212;  it's like they are hissing through clenched teeth, even though
they don't have any teeth  &#8212;  and they lower their heads and point their beaks at you
and hiss an ominous sort of growl.
This mama isn't doing that. Also, if she were alarmed by my presence, she would be up on her feet,
facing me, and defying me. And the children would be up on their feet and running for the water,
and the father, whose tail you see, would turn and face me and threaten me too.
Nope, this mama just wants some breakfast in bed for her and the kids.

Hello Daneng,
<p>
Thanks for the links. That research finds that there is a genetic basis for how some people get more
pleasure out of alcohol than others. Also, I noticed their statement that there was a lot of variation
in how much dopamine people got out of drinking alcohol. That suggests different mutations of a gene, 
or several different genes involved in the reaction to alcohol. Personally, I have long suspected that
it is the later. But in this case, they actually have the dopamine response pegged to two specific mutations of
the 118 gene  &#8212;  118A and 118G. That is pretty darned specific.
<p>
I also liked the director's optimistic note that this may lead to personalized medications for alcoholics.

Subject:  	your writings<br>

<p>
Let me begin by saying that I have found your writings interesting and enjoyable. I
also would like to thank you for just having saved me a waste of 2 hours going to an
AA meeting.
<p>
I first started going to AA in 1996. I never knew anything about the organization,
only that people with alcohol problems went there to stop drinking. Upon my first
meeting, I indeed found it off-putting and not quite right that God and a big book
were introduced. I never thought that that was what I had to put up with. Nor did I
realize there was a collection of money that was &quot;optional.&quot; I mean really, if it's
optional, why have it?
<p>
Anyhow, I continued to go once per week and tried to keep it at that. I just wanted
some like-minded people to talk to. Unfortunately, I couldn't &quot;keep it simple&quot;
because the other veterans forced a sponsor upon me and were constantly telling me
how I needed to &quot;go to more meetings.&quot; The sponsor was useless and just a pain in
the ass. Like church attendance, a short talk on the phone was time I could have
used to do other, more enjoyable things....like stabbing myself repeatedly.
<p>
I stopped going to these meetings after about 6 months and was sober for 3 years. I
found other things that motivated me to stop drinking. Then I started again after
1999 and want to stop again. Of course, I thought that going to AA was the solution
and should have known from past experience that it wasn't. Funny how one would doubt
oneself and disregard the truth.
<p>
What I wanted to do is thank you for the reality check and the enjoyable read.
<p>
Best regards,

<p>
Patrick

<p>
O,

<p>
Nicely done.  I am impressed by the breadth of your critique, if not by the
arguments.  There are some deep crevasses in your arguments that stem from the bias.
Now, I have a bias too, and it is that AA is working for me in a way that my
experiential will-power was not working.  If that's a trick of mind, I am okay with
that, because at least I am no longer winding up in hospitals and waking up in
different states (Wyoming?), etc.  I am living now because of the help I received
from AA.

<p>
I wish I had time to comb through your papers to give you my considered thoughts
from my side of the wall, but, alas, I work like a dog and I am newly a parent.  I
confess, I have thought many the same things as you.  It took a minor miracle to
have a change of perspective.

Hello Luke,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well and maintaining your sobriety, in spite of your belief in a hoax.
Such is life. It is especially good that you are keeping yourself sober when children are involved.
<p>
Now if you want to delude yourself into believing all kinds of things that are not true, that is your right.
It's a free country, and you can join any cult religion you wish, and believe any crazy thing you want.
But it is definitely a sin, and probably a crime, to deceive sick newcomers about what might cure them, and
how well the suggested cure works.

About your Shakespeare line: Remember that you can put a bunch of drunk
monkeys in a room with a cult leader, and sooner or later,
five percent of them will quit drinking anyway.

Hello Sir or Madam,

<p>
I have just recently read your preposterous essay that slanders Alcoholics
Anonymous.  I too, like you, once fancied myself an intellectual.  I am 25
years old and know the merit of AA and the God-given program that he and
Dr. Bob created.  There is no worse sin than spreading misinformation.  I
hope that someday you will become truly open-minded.  You will be able to
use that brain that God gave you a little better then.  Why strive to write
arguments that have no meaning?  It's a fruitless endeavour my friend.   I
had a lot of resentment and contempt for organized religion before and
still am weary of a starry-eyed religious folk that preaches but know there
is a God, of my understanding.  He/she/it is everything.  Hope someday you
come to this realization and stop writing such foolish essays.  It is good
that you are trying to help people, but maybe (just a possibility) you are
being detrimental.  Not writing this to offend you, just because I take
offense to your page.  Have a good day.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Lee

<font color="blue">
Hello Lee,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It is a good demonstration of parrotting of the standard A.A. misinformation.
<p>
For example, the A.A. &quot;program&quot; is not &quot;God-given&quot;, and it was
not created by William Griffith Wilson and Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith. They actually
just repackaged Dr. Frank Buchman's pro-Nazi Oxford Group cult. And Bill Wilson even said so:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>The Language of the Heart</i>, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>
<p>

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got its ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.

</blockquote>
<p>

Bill Wilson was being dishonest when he listed Rev. Sam Shoemaker as the leader of the Oxford Groups.
Sam Shoemaker was the Number Two man.
Dr. Frank Buchman was the leader, the founder, and the author of those
&quot;steps&quot;, but Bill didn't want to mention Frank Buchman's name because
Frank Buchman had a horrible reputation for
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler2" target="_blank">his praise of Adolf Hitler
and Heinrich Himmler and the Nazis</a>,
and his
<a href="orange-rroot420.html" target="_blank">unpatriotic draft-dodging schemes</a>
during World War Two.

</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Now those are the facts. You may not like people telling the truth about A.A., but those are the facts.

<p>
Speaking of facts, while you are praising A.A. so strongly, why don't you answer this one
simple but very important question that no Stepper has ever answered honestly?

<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
Or even several years later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">here</a>.)
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Lastly, telling sick people the truth about how well suggested cures work is not &quot;detrimental to them&quot;.
It is in fact the least that you can do, and doctors are required by law to do full disclosure.
Why not A.A. sponsors?
<p>
A.A. routinely uses the dodge that telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous is &quot;doing a disservice to
those seeking sobriety.&quot; They also like to complain that I'm killing alcoholics by telling the truth.
And some even claim that I don't care how many alcoholics I kill.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="_blank">Look here</a>. 
But the real facts of the matter are that it is A.A. that is killing alcoholics by telling them that
they are powerless over alcohol, and cannot ever recover, and should not see a doctor, and should not take
their doctor-prescribed medications, and should just devote their lives to the practices of an old
pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties...

<p>
Have a good day now.

Well I guess you have an opinion.  I hope that you are doing this out of a

Frank Buchanan maybe correct.  I, honestly, acknowledge that I don't know
the facts behind that.  I think that the message stated in the steps of AA
has merit though.  I disagree that you are correct in putting that web page
up, based on the opinion that people should have access to other methods of
recovery.  There are a lot of rehabs which deal with psychological
approaches to addiction.  You just have to flick on the tube to see that
(Celebrity Rehab, Dr Phil, etc).  But hey, it's still a free country right?
You should have the right to your opinion.  I just disagree with it lol.
There is more to the universe than meets the eye.  More to the Universe
than we can explain from our limited conciousness. Have a good day Orange.

Hello again, Lee,
<p>
The problem with &quot;the A.A. message&quot; is that the message is really that
<ul>
<li> Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion practices will make you holy and special.
<li> And you are powerless over your problems.
<li> And you are insane.
<li> And that you should surrender <i><b>your will</b></i> and your life to
somebody else and let them &quot;take care&quot; of your life for you.
<li> And that you will be a better person if you confess everything all of the time.
<li> And <i>Somebody Else</i> will fix your defects for you.
<li> And that you should conduct s&eacute;ances and hear the Voice of God
(<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">or spirits, or devils, or something</a>...),
giving you orders and telling you what to do.
<li> And you will get
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">a wonderful &quot;spiritual experience&quot; or &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;</a>
 from those cult practices.
<li> And that you should go recruit more members for the cult.
</ul>

<p>
All that Bill Wilson did was hijack a branch of Frank Buchman's &quot;Oxford Group&quot; cult and rename it to
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;. The 12 Steps are
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">the recruiting and indoctrination and brainwashing
practices of Frank Buchman's cult</a>, not a formula for quitting drinking. That is why none of the 12 Steps
even mention quitting drinking.

<p>
Then it appears that you do not believe in freedom of speech, and you don't think that people should have
access to all of the information about a suggested &quot;cure&quot; for addictions.

<p>
The least that I can say about that is that it is un-American. Americans believe in freedom of speech.
It is also in violation of the medical laws that require doctors and healers to do full disclosure of the
success rates and risks of any suggested treatments.

<p>
I do not endorse either celebrity rehabs or Dr. Phil or Dr. Drew. I find them to be just some more quacks, really
heartless quacks who exploit sick people for TV ratings.
Look here for some correspondence about Dr. Drew and Dr. Phil and his recovery hoax:<br>

<p>
Please note that changing the debate to a discussion of celebrity rehabs is a diversion.
I'm talking about the failure of 12-Step treatment, not the failure of celebrity rehabs on TV.

<p>
Nonsense. Somebody can use the same lines to promote voodoo, black magic, and witchcraft:

<p>
<blockquote>

<i>&quot;There is more to the universe than meets the eye.  More to the Universe

wearing a pointed black hat and muttering spells while stirring a cauldron doesn't work?&quot;</i><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a bogus argument because we don't need to know everything in the universe to be able to test
whether medicines and treatments really work and cure our ills or are just quack medicine.
The FDA tests medicines every day.
And A.A. has been properly tested, and it failed every test. A.A. is just quack medicine that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increases the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
By the way, you never answered my question about the A.A. cure rate. What is it? Is A.A. really worth doing?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

Your research (didn't read all of it) is very detailed and well presented.

<p>
I wonder if you have time to answer these questions (I already know the
answer from your site....attitude change)

<p>
Why do some alcoholics recover and some don't? (apart from the 5% natural
attrition rate.) Compare my mother (never stopped drinking or lying, now
dead) to others I know who have given up late in their lives (aged 62).

<p>
A bipolar friend has been a chronic alcoholic for years &#8212; sure he's
'self-medicating' is this a bit of a cop out? Compare him with other
bi-polar people who give up the grog &amp; their medication starts to work
properly so they become 'well'... How much of being 'well' involves pulling
your finger out &amp; how much is just 'its part of their condition etc'. DO
alcoholics require compassion or honesty when they are full of shit?

<p>
I'm confused. Your opinion would  be appreciated.

Hello Emma,
<p>
Thanks for a great letter. Unfortunately, you are asking some of the toughest questions in the world.
Plenty of people with letters like &quot;Ph.D.&quot; and &quot;M.D.&quot; after their names are trying to answer those
same questions.

<p>
Coincidentally, I just got a letter that referred to a study that was published by the NIAAA, here:
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005331/http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/NewsEvents/NewsReleases/Pages/dopamine_response.aspx" target="_blank">
http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/NewsEvents/NewsReleases/Pages/dopamine_response.aspx</a>
<p>
This study found that mutations of the gene that grows dopamine receptors
in peoples' brains makes some people get much more pleasure out of alcohol than other people.
So this evidence supports the idea that there are some people who are just born alcoholics.

<p>
Also notice how they talked about two mutations of that gene, the 118A and 118G variations, that cause different
levels of response to alcohol.  Things like that help to explain how one alcohol will eventually get a grip
and stop drinking, and another will just stubbornly commit suicide by bottle.


<p>
Then there are a zillion other factors, like bi-polar disorders, which certainly cause people to drink excessively.
Those people may not even have the mutated 118 gene; they have something else instead to make them bi-polar.
(But if they have both, then Wow!)

<p>
Then there are factors like the environment and childhood abuse and the mental condition of the person in question.
That matters a lot too.
See this study of how childhood abuse causes
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">a shrunken Cerebellar Vermis in the brain</a>.
Those people's ability to feel joy or happiness has been damaged.
Some people's heads are so messed up that they don't feel like life is really worth living.
Sometimes, getting stoned is the only way they can feel ecstacy.

<p>
You are right when you say that some people just use lines like &quot;self-medicating&quot;
as excuses. Yes, that is true.
And the &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; line is another excuse.
<p>
I also feel a lot of frustration when I'm dealing with an addict who just won't get honest,
and won't be realistic, and just lies and makes excuses for continued drinking or doping
even though it is obviously killing him. 
I try to be compassionate when dealing with such people, but I don't feel any
obligation to take their shit or agree with their bull.
Sometimes all that you can do is walk away and save your own sanity. I know that
isn't much of an answer, but until modern medicine invents some better cures,
sometimes that is all that you can do.
<p>

And in the end, it is undeniable that some people simply choose to quit drinking
and save their own lives, and some people choose to die. Now why is that?
I don't really know all of the answers.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

Subject:  	75% recovery rates?<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
Sometimes I attend AA meetings, but I'm trying to get out of the habit of it because
I am now seeing what a false system AA is. But I was wondering if you could help me
find the answer to a question. At the clubhouse I have been going to, I saw a flyer
for a Back to Basics course that claims AA had a recovery rate of nearly 75% in the
1940s. I've attached it to this email. You've proven that a lot of AA's claims are
lies, but I can't seem to find any evidence either for or against this one. I asked
about it at the club, and the three people I asked said something like, &quot;Just read
what Bill W. wrote in the Big Book and you'll see why so many people recovered in
the 1940s.&quot; This doesn't answer my question and it sounds like a way of sluffing off
the issue. Do you know where they get this 75% figure. I'm pretty sure it's false
anyway, but I'd like to know. Have a good day.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Cecily,
<p>
Thanks for a great question. And the answer is, &quot;That boasting about 75% recovered is a total lie, just
some B.S. that Bill Wilson made up and put in the Foreword to the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>
to encourage more people to join his cult and buy his book.&quot;

A lot of what you right is very inaccurate.  For example, joking and
laughing is not allowed in AA.  You forgot to mention rule 63 in the Big
Book is to never take yourself too seriously and laugh.  There are even
meetings in LA that encourage heckling speakers and making complete asses
of each other.  So, I'm not sure what the whole point of the website is,
but it seems like either propaganda or limited intelligence in conducting
your research.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Nicholas,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I know all about &quot;Rule 63&quot;, which says that you are not
&quot;allowed to take yourself seriously&quot;. Translation: you must constantly
criticize yourself and put yourself down. You must lament how stupid you were, until wonderful A.A.
and your sponsor showed you The Path. You are not, however, allowed to criticize the 12 Steps, or
Alcoholics Anonymous, or The Founders Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith.
You are not allowed to tell the newcomers about the real A.A. failure rate, and how A.A. is just a bunch
of cult religion bullshit that doesn't work at all.
Anybody who talks like that will get shouted down immediately, for &quot;making a
complete ass of himself&quot;.

<p>
I've been to plenty of A.A. meetings, so I know how the subtle censorship works. My criticism of A.A.
isn't just &quot;propaganda&quot;.

Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
I've been reading many of your papers on different aspects of AA and I
wanted to thank you for getting the word out. You gave a voice to all those
nagging thoughts and suspicions I tried so hard to quell during my nearly
11 month stint as a fully active member of Alcoholics Anonymous. I withdrew
from college 2 years ago, drinking and drugging to deal with untreated PTSD
and DID. I had also just gotten out of an abusive relationship, so my
self-esteem was completely shot. I am only too embarrassed now to see how I
fell for AA hook, line and sinker. I became convinced that I needed help,
decided to focus on the alcohol abuse rather than my mental issues, and did
2 full weeks of day treatment at Kaiser CDRP before being sent into a
12-step based rehab for the full 60 days allowed on my insurance benefits.

<p>
At first, AA was amazing. I loved the groups and the camaraderie, and the
instant intimacy. I've always had a way with words, and that helped me gain
popularity quickly. It was 'suggested' that I step down my treatment, from
rehab to a Sober Living Environment, and I went back to Kaiser's CDRP and
completed their whole program. I was living in SF, going to Kaiser
inpatient in the morning and 2 meetings in the afternoon, living with a
bunch of people forced to work the 12 steps, and developing a large network
of AA pals. Around 3 months sober, I started to wake up, but at the time my
only two options were living sober in the city or living back with my
parents. Considering they were cult members of Adi Da for nearly 2 decades
and were the main reason I deal with PTSD and DID in the first place, I
decided staying in the city and continuing to do AA was better than living
with them.

<p>
At 6 months sober, I was gaining respect in the rooms. I only hung out with
people who were fully &quot;in the boat&quot;, I knew how to talk the talk, and I
will admit that I really enjoyed the excess attention and support and
admiration I was getting. But something wasn't right. If almost all the
women I had attended rehab with had already relapsed, if the 'elders'
seemed to relapse no matter how 'spiritual' they were getting, if
everything that stands for the program is god's will and everything that
conflicts with it is your disease, then wait......what??? How can the bad
times be god's will just as much as the good times are? How can AA be
accountable if they are shoving the responsibility of drinking or not back
onto their members? If you're unhappy, that's God testing you, and if
you're happy, that's God blessing you. The circular logic started to gnaw
at me, little by little, until first I stopped talking in the meetings,
then I went to less meetings, and then I finally dropped out.

<p>
I am happy to say that I only fully tried going back to AA once this year.
They got me so badly, that after I went on a stress-induced total bender, I
bought back into the program and went back to Day Treatment at Kaiser. And
brainwashing feels so good at first! My old friends, who were part of the
5% success rate and now active, prominent members of AA, brought me to
meetings again and suggested I dump my boyfriend. After all, I was working
the program, and he obviously wasn't. His disease was going to get me! I
dropped AA, finally went back to college this past quarter, and joined a
sorority instead. And wow, I was actually hanging out with 'normies', and
they didn't think I was a defective, flawed piece of shit? I was
flabbergasted that I could associate with such 'normal' people.

<p>
Anyway, I completely agree that AA is a deadly, horrible cult. And I'm
angry and feel betrayed by the medical system who sent me to 12-step
programs in the first place and filled my head with lies when I was at my
most vulnerable. It's hard to get over thinking of yourself as diseased and
defective, or to start to believe that hey, maybe sometimes i DON'T have a
part in someone else's bullshit. I was tired of being blamed for everyone
else's actions, simply because I was the alcoholic. Sometimes, people are
just assholes. It's a weird way they teach you to accept that you're
powerless over yourself, but somehow responsible for everyone else's
actions towards you.

<p>
What I'm really struggling with right now is trying to enlighten my
boyfriend, who also struggles with DID and PTSD. He never got into AA like
I did, yet he fully subscribes to their beliefs. When all he did was
AA-lite, I'm trying to understand how he can so devoutly stand behind a
program when he is living proof that you don't need it to be sober. He did
a few meetings, went to Kaiser's day treatment, and dropped out and got his
life back together on his own. He never got a sponsor, or worked the steps,
or did anything AA supposedly requires for sobriety. And yet he parrots
back to me the same old &quot;How dare you say something about a program that's
saved millions of lives, relationships and families??&quot; and refuses to look
at any outside evidence. This is quite possibly the largest fight we've
ever been in. In general, I would say that he is highly intelligent and
rational. But he is acting like a complete moron and I'm sort of disgusted
by him for being so dogmatic. I finally told him I was going to stop
debating with him, because he had yet to show me any shred of proof that AA
worked, and yet he calls me an arrogant child for disagreeing with him.
He's 'disappointed' in me, I think he's acting like an idiot... How can he
claim to be a success of AA without working the program? AA certainly
wouldn't call him a success. AA told me to stay away from him. He won't
listen to reason, and it's driving me up the wall.

<p>
Anyway, thanks for all your hard work putting your website together. It
certainly helped me a lot. Now I have to deal with the fact that Kaiser
sent my parents, semi-deprogrammed cult members, into Al-Anon, where they
are absolutely flourishing. I always knew my parents were total nutjobs,
but I was really hoping my boyfriend wouldn't drink the kool-aid. I do
think that if he saw me at my AA best (read:worst) though, he would start
to understand what I was talking about. If he saw me ignoring him at all
hours for meetings and AA socializing and constantly quoting those stupid
slogans like I used to, he would probably start to think differently. I
don't think he ever got involved enough to see the true workings of the
program. He only saw enough for that propaganda to become firmly lodged in
his head. Is there any way to deprogram a person who doesn't think he needs
deprogramming??

Hello Elly,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It says a lot. I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better, and you have
found your way to health.

<p>
I wish I had an easy answer for your boyfriend, but I don't think there is any easy answer.
I am reminded of the words of Carl Sagan:
<b>&quot;You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not
based on evidence, it's based on a deep-seated need to believe.&quot;</b>
<p>
And that's it. Your friend immediately rejects all evidence that contradicts what he wants to believe,
and he rejects information simply because it contradicts what he wants to believe. He is not
searching for the truth, or interested in finding the truth. He just wants his
favorite beliefs repeated back at him.
<p>
It is very revealing that he didn't even &quot;work the Steps&quot;, or
&quot;work the Program&quot;, and yet he fervently believes
in it.  That reveals a strong need to believe in <i>Something</i>. He is not a person who is
reporting his own experiences, and his belief is not based on observation or experiences. 
He is just parrotting the dogma of the cult. &quot;Millions saved....&quot;

<p>
This line is also significant:
<font color="black">&quot;he calls me an arrogant child for disagreeing with him.&quot;</font>
Yes, that is standard cult behavior. Don't debate the actual facts of the matter;
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">just attack the critic personally (<i>ad hominem</i>)</a>.
People who criticize the cult (any cult) are routinely called stupid, lazy, low-I.Q., evil, satanic, willfully
disobedient, blind, stubborn, obtuse, and &quot;arrogant and childish.&quot;
He cannot really debate the facts, because he doesn't have any facts on his side,
so he resorts to personal attacks on you.

<p>
The word &quot;arrogant&quot; also has special meaning: In the A.A. cult,
everybody is supposed to be meek and submissive and confess that they
don't know anything, and they are supposed to just think what they are
told to think, and do what they are told to do (in Step 11, or by their sponsor).
People who insist on thinking for themselves, and following their own conscience
and doing what they believe is right, rather than what the cult tells them to do,
are criticized for being &quot;arrogant big-shots&quot; who are &quot;against the Will of God&quot;.
<p>
Not at all coincidentally, a recent letter also accused me of &quot;playing God&quot;, apparently because I
insist on thinking for myself.
<a href="orange-letters275.html#Al_C" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
Now, about deprogramming him: Well, I'm not holding my breath, but there might be a small chance of success.
The first thing that occurs to me is Steve Hassan's trick of criticizing a different cult.
Cult members immediately reject any criticism of their own cult,
but they happily criticize other cults.
Cult members are notoriously hypocritical, and are quick to criticize other cults for obnoxious, insane
behavior, even when it's exactly the same things as they are doing in their own cult.
They do a lot of &quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#projection" target="_blank">projection</a>&quot;.

<p>
Pick out some bad characteristics of Scientology
or the Moonies or Jim Jones's People's Temple or the Heaven's Gate cult, and criticize them.
(<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Check out the Cult Test</a> for some material.)
Just accidentally, coincidentally-on-purpose pick some evil cult characteristics that A.A. also displays and
talk about how deluded those poor other cult members are, to act that way and believe that nonsense.

<p>
Never mention the A.A. name.
You have to just hope that maybe your friend will eventually connect the dots in his own mind, and maybe,
just maybe, the light bulb will go on in his head. Maybe, just maybe, when he is at an A.A. meeting
and listening to someone parrotting exactly the same words as they do in Scientology or the Moonies or
the Hari Krishnas, maybe he will see something.

<p>
Check out this anti-cult book by Steve Hassan:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank">
<i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>.
It is loaded with techniques for getting somebody out of a cult.
His other book isn't bad either, 
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="_blank">
<i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i></a>.
Both are described in the bibliography.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day now.

<p>
Sorry it took so long for me to respond. There's two reasons for that.
First reason is that I discovered that Morrowind runs about as well in
WINE as it does in Windows (I admit it: I'm a video game junkie. That
was probably pretty obvious from the mention of the expensive gaming
rig, and that's far from the only bit of paraphernalia I possess.)
Second is that AM melted the tip of its own charger, limiting my
computer access for a while (hopefully, AM's not getting any ideas from
its namesake). Judging by the fact the replacement charger has a
different design, it seems like charger-melting is a rather common
problem for this particular model laptop. And no universal charger fits
this thing. I tried. Why is it I could find both a standard third-party
universal charger and a car charger for a then-12-year-old laptop that
outlived the company that made it (Marvin's original charger disappeared
long before I got it), yet nothing for a Samsung laptop that's not even
a year old? Turns out that extended warranty I bought has paid off.

<p>
I've checked Knoppix's minimum system requirements, and it apparently
requires 96 MB of RAM for it's default graphical mode with KDE. I could
bring that down by replacing KDE with IceWM or Fluxbox (not really a big
KDE fan, anyway), but I'm not sure if that would be enough. Slitaz
&lt;http://www.slitaz.org/en/get/flavors.html&gt; could potentially work,
specifically the loram-cdrom one, but I really don't like the idea of my
CD drive being unusable, especially since that's one of the only ways
for Marvin to receive files from my newer systems.

<p>
I did manage to find this &lt;http://rescup.winbuilder.net/bootdisk/&gt;,
which seems like it would be a really useful tool for Marvin. I think
the utility you were thinking of is Smart Boot Manager, which is on that
disk.

<p>
Seems like you got some amusing pro-steppers since my last email.<br>
&gt; There is no worse sin than spreading misinformation.<br>
<a href="orange-letters276.html#Lee_M" target="_blank">Lee M.</a>,
you owe me a new irony meter. You also owe me medical expenses
for the injuries I incurred as a result of the explosion. And why
exactly are you so offended by something that, according to you, has no
meaning? It's simple. You disagree and have no way to refute Orange's
arguments, so you declare his site to be false and meaningless. I'm not
even sure if you've read most of his site. It's confirmation bias. Like
any other stepper, you reject any information that does not fit AA
dogma, regardless of its veracity. You're no intellectual. Odds are, you
never were. Your backstory seems as phony as Bill W. and AA itself. It
looks exactly like all the other phony stepper backstories.

<p>
Sorry about hijacking your soapbox there, Orange, but it's been a while
since I've sharpened my teeth on some snark.

<p>
As for
<a href="orange-letters271.html#Richard_M" target="_blank">Richard M., 90%</a>,
seriously? Am I really supposed to believe that
hardly any alcoholic ever noticed that those brown bottles were making
them feel like crap before Bill W. told them it did? As you correctly
pointed out, there was already a recovery movement before AA. Any decent
U.S. History text mentions said recovery/temperance movement. Why? The
first half of the 19th Century had a lot of reform movements (school
reform, prison reform, mental health reform, etc),  and the temperance
movement was a sort of proto-feminism, since a lot of women supported it
as a way to fight domestic abuse (of course it was a lot easier to
target the booze than the assholes drinking it). AA, on the other hand,
is just another cult religion that's worth a footnote, at best.

<p>
And you're apparently Fox News now. Really? In that case, Orange, you
really need to get busy on posting all about the War on Christmas. It's
December. There is absolutely nothing more newsworthy than a fake war
based on how that Walmart greeter greets you.

<p>
You know, your father sounds a lot like my paternal grandfather, judging
by what I've heard about him. My dad never says much about either his
father or his childhood, but he does his absolute best to not be like
him. I believe he's succeeded. My dad is not the brightest crayon in the
box, but he's a very loving man, and his current alcohol habits (going
out to a bar twice a week) are more accurately defined as a mid-life
crisis, rather than alcoholism. Apparently, my grandfather was also a
sexist asshole. Going by my mom's story, he was very disappointed that
my sister was not a boy, and when my brother was born, he ignored his
female grandchildren in favor of him. He never had a chance to be
disappointed by me, though, since he died before I was born. Thank
heavens for small favors.

<p>
Just as a note on the tough love and the Pearls nonsense, that reminds
me a lot of Attachment Therapy
&lt;http://childrenintherapy.org/essays/overview.html&gt; (entire site is
worth reading), which is the same child abuse wrapped in a
pseudo-psychology. Here
&lt;http://web.archive.org/web/20100815050600/http://stopchildtorture.org/&gt;
is another website, written by a survivor of AT. I'm not surprised that
that second site can only be found in the Wayback Machine, since these
&quot;therapists&quot; do have a history of taking down sites critical of their
practices. Sadly, a lot of that site's best posts were not archived, but
the In Memorium page
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005331/http://web.archive.org/web/20100904194427/http://stopchildtorture.org/2008/02/26/in-memoriam/" target="_blank">
&lt;http://web.archive.org/web/20100904194427/http://stopchildtorture.org/2008/02/26/in-memoriam/&gt;</a>

<p>
and half of the survivor stories
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005331/http://web.archive.org/web/20100729195249/http://stopchildtorture.org/survivors-index/" target="_blank">
&lt;http://web.archive.org/web/20100729195249/http://stopchildtorture.org/survivors-index/&gt;</a>

<p>
are intact (the link to the second half of Katrina's story doesn't work,
but you can find the text for it on the front page.) If those sites get
too depressing, here

 &lt;http://cuteoverload.com/tag/birds/&gt;</a>

 is a minor
antidote for that.

<p>
Now to determine which video game will become my latest addiction. Happy
Holidays, Orange.

Oh, and I just opened up my ex-host Windows 7 VM after not touching it
for weeks, in an attempt to get The Elder Scrolls Construction Set for
Morrowind (does not work as well as the game itself does, and I had no
luck with my Windows 2000 VM, either) to work, and clean up some
extraneous programs so that the damn thing's actually somewhat useful.
Now, Microsoft has declared my copy of Windows 7 to be counterfeit. Fuck
you very much, Microsoft. If I actually pirated your product, I would
probably not have that problem. And the fact that Windows 7 is now one
of many VMs rather than my host OS is entirely your fault, too.

Hi again, Rebecca,
<p>
Thanks for the input. It's okay for you to &quot;highjack my soapbox.&quot; I find the comments amusing.

<p>
About the father thing, yes, I think that it is pretty much human nature to go to extremes in such
a situation. Either the child is brutalized and turns out exactly like good old Dad (shades of the Stockholm
Syndrome), or else the child goes to the opposite extreme and turns into a parent who
never beats the kids. I took the latter path and became a good peacenik Hippie.
