Subject:  	Hi again<br>

<p>
Hi again Orange,
<p>
Hope you are well. Just one or two even more things i forgot to mention in my
previous letter which I'm sure you will appreciate.. Members are repeatedly
told to &quot;use a Group Of Drunks&quot; in the third step as an understanding of
God.... Ok here's the problem with that one..... Does that mean that AA members
in step 5 have to go around all of AAs meetings and confess to the group
their moral failing etc etc as they have done in step 4.... Also how on earth
does a &quot;Group Of Drunks &quot; &quot;completly&quot; as said in the step remove all our
defects????? Also how does a &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot; take away somebody's
shortcomings?????? Does that mean that we are a looking at a collection of
AA members as God??
<p>
Also how can one pray to a group of drunks in step 11????? I have heard
people say that &quot;your defects and shortcomings don't get taken away; you just
become aware of them&quot; Hmmmmm doesn't that PROVE the steps dont work???? They
say COMPLETLEY remove our defects.  If that's the case, and they don't get
removed &#8212; just highlighted so to speak &#8212; the steps dont do a damned
thing????? (Am i right in that?)..
<p>
 Also now this one's my favourite.. If we can
have a Group Of Drunks as our higher power (that word makes me cringe), then
we are looking to a human aid to solve our alcoholism, and it even says in
the big book that human aid was useless... Page 60 4th edition
<ul>
<li> a) &quot;that we were alcoholic and we could not manage our own life&quot;
<li> b) &quot;THAT PROBABLY NO HUMAN POWER COULD HAVE RELIEVED OUR ALCOHOLISM&quot;
<li> c) &quot;That God could and would if He was sought...&quot;
</ul>
So that more or less proves the steps are a tool for
conversion.  Repeatedly folks will say &quot;your best thinking got you here&quot; &quot;dont
trust your mind&quot; etc etc but in step 3 they say its Ok to use human
intelligence in the form of an AA group?????? Does that smell fishy or more
importantly Plain stupid and hipporcritical????? Its always one-sided with
AA &#8212; they want it both ways all the time and cant see the obvious flaws and
mistakes in their program.. Or ignorantly they fail to acknowledge
them....
Now personally speaking if a person chooses faith of one kind then
I'm all for that person provided they have CHOSE to follow faith, not had it
rammed down there throat and told they will relapse etc etc .... Basically what
AA doesn't understand is that regardless of what alcoholism is (I personally
prefer the term compulsive behaviours) whether it's a disease, illness, or
whatever, you can go round and round trying to figure out why we drank &#8212; were we
diseased, did we fail as people, are we weak, etc etc.
 you always draw upon the
same conclusion and that is &quot;JUST DO NOT PICK UP THAT FIRST DRINK&quot; and it
really is that simple.... Complicating things like AA does just repeatedly
makes you question things and also makes you very paranoid especially if you
are vunerable towards mental health conditions......
<p>
Anyways orange just
thought I'd throw that one in the mix and look forward to what you think of
it so to speak...
<p>
So take care and keep up the good work keep on enjoying
life the way you do and all the best.....
<p>

Hi again, Jamie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Yes, using a &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot; as your &quot;G.O.D.&quot; is barking mad.
Theologically, it is beyond insane, it's practically Satanic.

<p>
Quite right: Just &quot;highlighting&quot; your &quot;defects of character&quot;
is totally different from God actually removing them. Bill Wilson wrote in Step 7<br>

<font color="black"><b>&quot;Humbly, on our knees, asked Him to remove our shortcomings &#8212; holding nothing back.&quot;</b></font><br>

(Of course Bill later rewrote that Step to
<font color="black"><b>&quot;Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.&quot;</b></font>,
but that is
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">another story</a>.)<br>

Bill did not write anything about &quot;just highlighting&quot; your
defects and wrongs and moral shortcomings; he wrote &quot;remove&quot;.
Somebody is playing switcheroo word games again. But that is normal for A.A.

<p>
I like your points about Bill writing that &quot;No human power would save us&quot;,
but then suddenly the A.A. group (as G.O.D.) is human power that works and will save us.
That smells like another bait-and-switch trick. And so does the &quot;remove, no highlight&quot; excuse.


<p>
And yes, the final answer to alcohol abuse is simply,<br>

Subject:  	They're at it again...<br>

<p>
Hi, Terry:
<p>
  One of the feeds that I subscribe to gave me these two stories
yesterday.  The first is a study claiming that twelve-step attendance for women who
have been incarcerated (starting during incarceration and continuing after release)
reduces drinking:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162625/http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-effects-alcoholics-anonymous-women-prison.html" target="_blank">
http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-effects-alcoholics-anonymous-women-prison.html</a>

<p>
And this one claims that there is a &quot;robust association between an increase in
attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a decrease in the
frequency and intensity of alcohol use over time.&quot;

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162625/http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-effects-spirituality-alcoholics-anonymous-alcohol.html" target="_blank">
http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-12-effects-spirituality-alcoholics-anonymous-alcohol.html</a>

<p>
Both of these studies are being published in the March 2011 edition of a journal
called &quot;Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research&quot;, which I hadn't heard of
before.  According to Blackwell Publishing's web site &#8212;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162625/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0145-6008" target="_blank">
http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0145-6008</a><br>
&#8212;
 the journal was founded by the National Council on Alcoholism.  Hmm, that name sounds familiar.<br>
*cough cough AA front group cough*

<p>
Considering the source, I'd say it's pretty much a given that both these studies are
flawed.  I hope you'll take the time to review and critique them, publishing your
findings on your web site.  I'd pursue this myself, but I'm afraid I just don't have
time right now.  (In a few weeks, things will slow down for me.)

<p>
Hope you're doing well.
<p>
 Best, P

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Parrish,
<p>
Thanks for the links. That is some interesting sleuthing.

<p>
The first paper, the one about the women prisoners, has numerous flaws:

<ol>

<p><li> It was not a controlled study. The proper way to do such a test is to get a large
group of women and <b>randomly</b> divide them into two equal groups. Then send one group to
A.A., and send the other group home to do whatever they wish. And then see what happens.
Check back a year later and see who is sober, and who is dead, and who is in jail, and who
is unemployed, and so on.
That will tell you what the effect of Alcoholics Anonymous really is.

<p><li>
The people who went to A.A. were a self-selected population. That is, the women who really wanted
to stay clean and sober,
and who had been lied to and made to believe that 12-Step meetings would really help,
 went to A.A. (and/or maybe N.A.), and also kept themselves clean and
sober, while the women who just wanted to get high again didn't go to 12-Step meetings.
A.A. is not due any of the credit for any sobriety there.

<p><li>
The women were <i><b>prisoners</b></i>. That is not a normal population. You know that a lot
of them were out on parole. You know that their parole officer told them that they must stay clean
and sober, or else they go back to prison. And you know that if a woman had any prior problems
with drugs or alcohol, she got sent to A.A. or N.A. meetings. And in fact,
the article says that the women in question were
&quot;incarcerated hazardously-drinking women returning to the community.&quot;

<p>
So, then some four-eyes &quot;researchers&quot; come along and want to study the women. The women get taken
into an office where somebody is questioning them about their meeting attendance and sobriety.
Does anybody imagine that the women ex-prisoners are going to say anything but that they
are going to meetings all of the time, and they are 100% clean and sober?
<p>
It doesn't matter how much the &quot;researchers&quot; promise confidentiality, there is nothing like
a few years in prison to teach distrust of authorities. No way is a woman going to hang herself
by confessing that she has been drinking or doping. She has too much at stake.
You can bet money that the women will report that they go to three meetings per week, at least,
and never drink or dope at all.

<p><li>
This &quot;study&quot; is worthless.

</ol>

<p>
Now, about the second paper:
&quot;The effects of spirituality in Alcoholics Anonymous on alcohol dependence&quot;.

<p>
This is even worst bullshit. Pardon my language, but it's bullshit.
The word &quot;spirituality&quot; is the dead give-away.
There isn't even any agreement on what that word means. &quot;Spirituality&quot; is different
things to different people.
<p>
And there is no scientific way to measure &quot;spirituality&quot;. What is the researcher supposed
to do?

<ul>
<p><li> Count how many times per hour the subject yammers a religious slogan?

<p><li> Guess how superstitious the subject is?

<p><li> Measure the degree of dissociation from reality?
<ul>
<li> &quot;God is going to provide, and pay the rent.&quot;
<li> &quot;My 20 years of drinking was just God's way of preparing me to help others.&quot;
<li> &quot;Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in God's world by mistake.&quot;
<li> &quot;I have surrendered and turned my life over to God.&quot;
</ul>

<p><li> Worst yet, it is a matter of opinion
&#8212; subjective judgement &#8212; on the part of
the &quot;researcher&quot; when judging how &quot;spiritual&quot; somebody is.
And, due to the anti-Christian bias of A.A., often the opinions are:
&quot;Joe is going to A.A. meetings, and they taught him to believe in &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
and he is really spiritual. Kathy is going to the Catholic
Church with all of its dead old rituals, and that isn't spirituality.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
This line is important:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The results indicated that there was a robust association between an
increase in attendance to AA meetings with increased spirituality and a
decrease in the frequency and intensity of alcohol use over time.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
As soon as you hear the word &quot;association&quot;, you know that it's fraud.
When you hear about &quot;associations&quot;, you know that they did not do a proper test
with a control group to establish a real
cause-and-effect relationship. They just ran a statistics program and found that people who do something
besides go to a bar and drink alcohol actually do drink less alcohol.
As in, &quot;Devoting all of one's time to playing tiddly-winks was associated
 with increased sobriety.&quot;
Yes, if you do nothing but play tiddly-winks, then you aren't drinking.
If you spend all of your spare time at the meetings of a cult religion, then you aren't drinking.

<p>
And then this is the dead give-away of what is really going on:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Many people will be surprised that alcoholic patients with little
or no interest in spirituality attended AA and seemed to change even
more than did those who had a pre-existing, strong sense of spirituality,&quot;
said Keith Humphreys, a Career Research Scientist with the Veterans
Health Administration and Professor of Psychiatry at Stanford University.
&quot;AA is thus much more broad in its appeal than is commonly recognized.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have discussed Keith Humphreys' and Rudolf Moos' pseudo-science many times before, like
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="newwin2222">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="newwin2223">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters31.html#Moos3" target="newwin39">here</a>. They run a non-stop
propaganda machine for the 12-Step industry.

<p>
It is really disgusting when frauds and quacks use the trappings of science to promote
their favorite superstitions.
And they are also using taxpayers' money to do it.

<p>
Have a good day, and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Thanks in advance for not using my name &#8212; feel free to make up a name as you wish.
Very impressive work &#8212; would've saved myself a lot of grief had I come across this
*a lot* earlier.
<p>
Will keep this brief as I'm sure you can assume most of the background information.
During group therapy (A.A. recruitment), I stupidly mentioned that I was interested
in exploring the SMART approach after completing current therapy.  Yeah... this
didn't go over well.  Since then, group therapy is now led by scowls, put-downs,
A.A. propaganda videos, etc.
<p>
Anyhow, I'm coming up on completing my 20 mandatory sessions.  Have noticed that for
others who are close to completion, the therapists call the respective insurance
companies requesting to max out on coverage of additional sessions (read:  $$$$).
Total scam.  I can endure finishing the 20 sessions to keep a smile on my employer's
face &#8212; as for additional sessions, do you know of any success stories regarding
individuals contacting their insurance companies to put the kibosh on requests for
further coverage?
<p>
Thanks and enjoy the holidays!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sunflower,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and a darned good question. I don't know about that.
Perhaps the readers have some ideas.

<p>
I imagine that the insurance companies would sure like to cut their losses.
There must be someone that you can talk to.
<p>
And the &quot;treatment center&quot; or &quot;therapists&quot;
won't continue the &quot;treatment&quot; if they aren't getting paid.
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">The so-called &quot;treatment program&quot; that I was in</a>
graduated me just as soon as the available health
insurance money ran out.
I even graduated early because I had used up a lot of the available
funds getting acupuncture to kill the pain of the flu.
So there wasn't so much money left for &quot;group therapy&quot; sessions,
so hey-presto! I was cured early.

<p>
I would definitely call the insurance company, and find out who to talk to.
I am amazed that the health insurance companies are not really on top of this one.
They are usually very good at figuring out how to not pay.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Hi Orange,
<p>
love your site; one of the things I noticed about AA members in my 3 years
in the cult, was how many smoked and ate the most trashy food, as if this had nothing
to do with staying sober. The problem with this religious program is that it never
moves forward, which of course is proof of its religiousity.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Garry,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, I have to agree. Totally ignoring simple basic health like a good
diet, and living on coffee and cigarettes, is a huge flaw in the Alcoholics Anonymous
lifestyle. What they ignore is the fact that a lot of people are drinking to excess to
mask the pain that comes from killing yourself with cigarettes and malnutrition &#8212;
and then alcohol.
And there is nothing &quot;spiritual&quot; about that.
<p>
Real recovery requires building a positive, balanced, healthy lifestyle so
that you can be happy sober. And A.A. just doesn't do that.
<p>
Have a good day, and a Merry Christmas now.

Dear Mr. Hodgins.

<p>
First of all, your pen name is strange.  I am a Viet Nam veteran whose
diabetes was traced back to being in a defoliation zone in which agent
orange (dioxin) was used. I'm not angry about that but are you too a victim?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Bill,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
I'm sorry to hear about your medical problems.
Fortunately, I never got poisoned by Agent Orange.
The name began as a joke about mixing Apples and Oranges.
And then the name became &quot;Secret Agent Orange&quot; because I was really anonymous.
And then it got shortened to just &quot;Agent Orange&quot;.
And then I dropped the &quot;Agent&quot; and now
it's just &quot;Orange&quot;. So we've come full circle, from Orange to Orange.
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Agent_Orange" target="newwin129">
See the story of the &quot;Orange&quot; name, here</a>.

<p>
But there is a link to the chemical: I was involved in 
<a href="orange-letters179.html#agent_orange" target="_blank">the protest project to prevent
the DOD from dumping their left-over Agent Orange here in the USA</a> 
and poisoning a lot of people's water. And we actually won that fight.

</font>
<p>
Anyway,  I read a Tom Powers book entitled &quot;First Questions in the Life of
the Spirit&quot; published in 1958(?) by Harper.  It is now out of print.  If you
can find a copy I encourage you to read it.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'd love to find a copy. I'll look for it.
</font>
<p>
Powers never says directly he is an alcoholic in the book, but he makes
mention of AA as an organization that helps drunks get on the spiritual
path.

<p>
Powers was an atheist at one time, but later seems to have become a
Christian.

<p>
He makes reference to the fact he went through a number of sessions of shock
therapy at a sanitarium with the 'aid' of a drug called metrazol.  This
story is very similar to the one in the Big Book that talks about the &quot;one
time president of the (American?)  atheist society...&quot;
<p>
In Powers' AA talks (these are also worth hearing) he makes mention having
known of Bill W. but leaves it at that.  He is more interested in other
things &#8212; like living the spiritual life.  He has an understanding of drinking
that few AA speakers can relay.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What understanding?
</font>
<p>
His book was later revised and published as &quot;Invitation to a Great
Journey&quot;.  This volume leaves out the incredible bibliography that powers
graded from easy to difficult. It also leaves out much of the investigation
he conducted on life after death and the journey of the soul.

<p>
Good stuff all in all.

<p>
I read it early on and it's lessons have remained with me to now.

By the funniest of coincidences, I just got a letter from a fellow who lived with

I'll print that letter next,

<p>
Merry Christmas to you to.

<p>
FWIW, I can offer no proof, but I do know for a fact that Thomas E Powers,
co-author of the 12+12, that gave Bill such a hard time about his womanizing
and smoking, died as a drunk bitter senile despotic cult leader. His East
Ridge group is/was a cult, to the point where even the
<a href="orange-letters207.html#Family_Foundation" target="_blank">Family School</a>
folks that came from there shun it.

<p>
I know he was drunk most of his later years because I saw that first hand
when I lived at East Ridge for 6 months. I saw him constantly squirting home
brewed homeopathic remedies that were made from 95% grain alcohol into his
mouth.  He probably took about a pint of neutral grain (aka: Everclear)
spirits a day this way. PLUS I found out after I left that he had been
telling people for years that consecrated wine (consecrated by their own
ministers for their own private church) doesn't count since once it's
consecrated, it transubstantiates and is now the blood of Christ, not wine,
so you can drink that. I heard third hand that he was good for a couple of
quarts of Holy Jesus' blood a day, and pushed that on his sponsees as a cure
for stress. That part may or may not be true, but the grain alcohol in
squirt bottles I saw with my own eyes.

<p>
Oh, and as for the four absolutes? One of the members of East Ridge, who
happened to be an attorney, was convicted of, disbarred and jailed for
embezzling nearly half a million of his clients escrow funds and giving it
to East Ridge, i suspect to help pay the mortgages on their properties,
which I was told were all mortgaged to the hilt at the time. This was
pre-real estate bubble collapse, BTW, so I can only imagine what their
financial situation looks like now.

<p>
Absolute cult devotion maybe? We could drop the 'e' and make it a vodka
advert! I'd laugh, but it's a shame really. I knew Mickey, and he was truly
honest at heart. I'm sure somehow it got rationalized as being for the
greater good, etc. I'm also sure Thomas E Powers put him up to it, too.<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162625/http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2004/09/22/grady22.htm" target="_blank">
http://archive.recordonline.com/archive/2004/09/22/grady22.htm</a>

<p>
Tom was an ex-adman, a born persuader who seemed to find his true calling
and forte in convincing others to mistrust themselves and to trust him to
run their lives. A truly despicable character if ever there was one. Since
the 70's he had basically been financially supported and waited on hand and
foot by his family/followers. East Ridge, now I think on it's 5th generation,
is so interbred that there is hardly a defining line left between East Ridge
members and his extended family &#8212; pretty much everyone of the 100 or so
community is related to him if not by blood, then at least one if not
several intermarriages.

<p>
All this from the co-author of AA's second most sacred text. Bill or at
least Bob, misguided as their approach may have been, I think honestly
believed what they preached. No doubt I think Bill also saw it as his trip
to success as well, but i think there was sincere belief, at least to some
extent, in what they taught. Not so for Tom, on the other hand, who i think
saw it all as nothing more than an amazingly good racket from the beginning.
Getting people to believe they can't trust their own thinking was just too
good a setup for the con-artist in  him to pass up. I think he was a
manipulative fox that used Bill's guilt over his acknowledged yet continued
shortcomings (women and smokes) to guide Bill a bit and carve out his own
powerbase. Yeah, Bill may have had affairs. But, um, Thomas E. Powers was
investigated by children's services after his own daughter accused him of
molesting her. She was found credible enough that she was placed in foster
care for a year or so. I think she eventually recanted her accusation, but
given what I have seen of the Tom, I ain't so sure the recantation was the
truth.

<p>
OH, and another little historical tidbit: Thomas E. Powers once told me &quot;I
wrote the godamn 12+12 and I am telling you that those people who tell you
your higher power can be a doorknob or a rock, well that's not AA. Your
higher power must bear some resemblance to The Living God.&quot; Pretty close to
an exact quote. I decided to remember that little gem as well as I could
when he dropped it on me.

<p>
So there you have it. The co-author of the 12+12 officially says you can't
have a doorknob as your higher power.

<p>
:)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Sean,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. That is very interesting. The link to the lawyer getting sent
to prison is especially good, because that is corroborating evidence.
<p>
And the detail about Child Services taking a child away from Tom Powers
and putting her in a foster home is also evidence,
and maybe they can be contacted, and some more corroborating evidence obtained.
Do you have any idea what year that was?
<p>
Coincidentally, I just received
<a href="orange-letters211.html#Bill_P" target="_blank">another letter about 
Tom Powers</a>, one that was very favorable to Powers.
But that guy also revealed that Tom Powers got electro-shock treatment &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;he went through a number of sessions of shock
therapy at a sanitarium with the 'aid' of a drug called metrazol.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Ummm, that is not healthy for the brain. I consider electro-shock treatment to be barbaric, in
spite of the fact that there are still some doctors who favor it.
Electro-shock is little better than the snake pit. Maybe worse. The snake pit doesn't burn
out brain cells.

<p>
By the way, there is a great similarity between your story and a story
that appeared in
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Fransway" target="_blank">Rebecca Fransway's
book <i>A.A. Horror Stories</i></a>.
There, the author also described an inbred community on a mountain-top
 where they supposedly based the community on
&quot;spiritual&quot; recovery principles, but it was really a cult ruled
by a crazy &quot;recovering&quot; drunkard who kept on
drinking. As I recall, the author got forced into that
&quot;recovery community&quot; by a court, as an alternative to prison, and the community
turned out to be a worse prison.
Is there any chance that both stories described the same community?
(I'll have to go back to the library and get Fransway's book again.)

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	Is coffee just as bad as alcohol<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,
<p>
 I have been reading your articles on AA, and it has occured to me
that, hey this AA shit is really going to turn me into a raving lunatic. I just
recently started working with a sponsor, and the first thing he had me do was
write down a 100 resentments. Well, I told him I do not have that many. Did he
hear that? No. He demanded I would write them down. So what do I do. I make some
up. now some are real, but most of them are dead or are just not around. I have
133 to be exact.
 When I actually started doing it. I noticed that it doesn't
matter what the other guy does. I am the bad guy in this.
<p>
 Well anyway i am
trying to come up with a written way of putting it down. I am not the kind of
person who can be one with his feelings. If it says 'how were you selfish'? I
would say I don't know. but what I really want to say is, &quot;screw this shit, I do
not have to take this psychological abuse.&quot;

<p>
Now on the subject of coffee. I have to say that to me it is another form of
substance abuse. What do you say? since i have been going to AA i have drank
more coffee than I have alcohol. And I still drink. If alcohol doesn't kill me,
coffee will.

<p>
thanks for allowing me to vent,

<p>
Darrell

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Darrell,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You are right, it is psychological abuse, and it is harmful.
You are supposed to go on and on about how bad you are, and how you are so full of
resentments &#8212; which actually has nothing to do with drinking alcohol, but Bill Wilson
wrote some crazy stuff in the <i>Big Book</i> about resentments, so now all of
the true believers repeat it as if it were Gospel Truth:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Resentment is the number one offender. It destroys more
alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual
disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill,
we have been spiritually sick.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 5,
<i>How It Works</i>, page 64.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But with the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth
of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is
infinitely grave.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 66.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Actually, Bill Wilson was crazy. He had no medical evidence, no psychological evidence,
and no reason to believe that resentments cause people to drink alcohol.
He just thought that resentments were bad things, because Buchmanism had taught him that
a &quot;spiritual&quot; person is meek and serene. In other words, a &quot;spiritual&quot; person
is a good submissive cult member who goes on and on about how bad and sinful he is.
<p>
That is no way to live.
<p>
By the way, &quot;Don't Feel Your Feelings&quot; is a standard cult characteristic.
It's in the Cult Test.
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_feel" target="_blank">The question is here</a>,
and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">the answer is here</a>.
Telling you that it is wrong to feel resentments keeps you from getting angry at some
grinning frauds who are selling you an old cult religion as a never-fails cure for
alcoholism.

<p>
About the coffee: I'm happy to say that coffee is not as bad as alcohol, not nearly.
A hundred thousand US citizens die from alcohol every year, but I can't recall the last
time I heard of somebody dying from coffee.
Drinking way too much coffee can be bad for your health, but it takes a lot.
The one negative thing that I've heard about coffee is that excessive coffee drinking
can increase the rate of pancreatic cancer. Still, it's a crap shoot.
It's just a matter of odds.
You can drink a ton of coffee for many years and suffer no ill effects.

<p>
If you are drinking a lot of coffee, the first thing I recommend is to buffer it with milk.
Drink Latt&eacute;s, not straight black coffee.
That will save you from an ulcer.  And use real milk, not that white powder
sodium caseinate &quot;coffee whitener&quot;. Real milk has calcium, which helps to take
the edge off of the caffeine.
<p>
If you are really drinking way too much coffee, then just cut down.  Alternate drinks.
Drink water or fruit juice or something other than coffee, like every other drink.
And avoid caffeinated soda pop. If you drink soda pop with caffeine alternating with coffee,
you are just getting hot and cold running caffeine.
Your head will jangle less if you cut down on the caffeine.

<p>
Have a good day, and Merry Christmas.

Hello R.M.
<p>
Thanks for the input.
Yes, that is an interesting article, isn't it? Dr. Cain makes so many good points
there.
<p>
And one of the most interesting side notes is this: The <i>&quot;Dr. E. M.
 Jellinek, a cofounder of the Yale School of Alcohol Studies&quot;</i>
whom Dr. Cain mentioned in that article, was apparently a fraud.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162625/http://www.peele.net/jellinek.html" target="_blank">Stanton Peele reported</a>
that
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162625/http://www.roizen.com/ron/rr11.htm" target="_blank">Ron Roizen investigated Jellinek</a>,
and found that Jellinek
didn't have the degrees that he claimed to have. Jellinek claimed that he had
a master's degree and a doctorate
from the University of Leipzig in Germany, but they said that Jellinek never got a
degree from them.
In fact, Jellinek's transcript shows that Jellinek was dropped from the University's rolls
in 1913 and 1914 for failure to attend classes or lectures.
Then it gets worse. Jellinek's whole academic career is faked.
<p>
So one of the &quot;leading authorities&quot; on &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
the guy who was big on promoting the disease theory of alcoholism,
the guy who spent his career advancing A.A. ideas of alcoholism like that alcoholics
are &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol,
was a non-degreed fake &quot;expert&quot; who just conned Yale into putting him on
the faculty. And then the so-called &quot;research&quot; that Jellinek did
consisted of little more than handing out questionaires to 60
Alcoholics Anonymous members, and generalizing from their answers, and declaring
that he knew all about alcoholism, and writing an authoritive book on the subject.
<p>
That's like giving questionaires to 60 Scientologists and then declaring that you
are the world's leading authority on psychiatry.

<p>
It just goes on and on. The level of deceit and quackery in the
 &quot;recovery industry&quot; is unbelievable.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas now.

<p>
Hey Orange, Terry,

<p>
You know I was just thinking about you a few days ago. My girlfriend has
just got sucked into paying $30,000.00 to send her daughter to treatment in
Ontario because I think she watched too much of that show <i>Intervention</i> and
thinks she can't do it at home here for free. Anyway on it goes. I was
telling my friend about your web site, but I don't think she really
understands. I told her how smart you were and that you were starting a mini
revolution by dispelling the A.A. myth. I wish you the  bestest (little kid
talk) Christmas ever. You do so much for so many, I hope you realize how much
you do by creating at least some awareness out of the bleakness of being an
addict. Heck I wish I knew there was a guy like you out there when I was
going through all my stuff, just so I knew I wasn't crazy because I couldn't
adapt to A.A. and thought I am doomed, I can't be honest, I must be one of
the unfortunates, etc. Anyway the reason I sent the guy a letter to Wired
was because I didn't read your post all the way through and I thought you
were asking for support to tell them to get real. Yes the article in Wired
reminded me of the Big Book, and the excerpts I have read from Susan
Cheevers' book. Music from the jazz age playing in the back ground etc. But
really bless your heart for all you do and bless Carmen and the little
goslings. I read your page more than you know. I think you are chosen to
make people take a look at what they are doing. The being powerless thing is
so nasty to teach people. We may not be able to handle booze and drugs, but
who could if they took a bunch, but anyway, thanks once again for what you
do. Sending you Christmas hugs and kisses in the ether. (no I am not trying
to put the moves on you. Haha)

<p>
Blessings All Ways,

<p>
Cindy R.

<font color="blue">
Hi again, Cindy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and don't apologize for sending the letter to Wired. They need
somebody to criticize them for publishing such obviously wrong garbage.
And I wish more people would send them a letter.

<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your friend getting cheated out of $30,000.
Bummer. Selling quack medicine sure is profitable, isn't it?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

BLOG NOTE: 23 December 2010
<p>
To All: Have a Merry Christmas, and remember that eggnog is great without whiskey.
<p>
At this time of the year, a lot of ex-drinkers feel deprived of their fair share of the fun and games.
I don't.
Some people ask me if I don't feel left out, or cheated in life, if I can't join in the partying and
get high at Christmas and New years. My answer is, &quot;Do I feel deprived and cheated because I can't consume
a poison that will leave me with a splitting headache and hung-over and cloudy-headed and sick and jittery?
No, I don't feel deprived. Been there, done that. It wasn't all that great. I really like the clarity
that I have now, and I plan to keep it, thank you.&quot;
<p>
Have a Merry Christmas.

Terrance,

Mike and I have made a new video on confirmation bias within AA. I was
hoping that you might link it as it has been a while since I have posted a
film and we could do with the comments and ratings.

<p>
I am still working on getting all the material for the AA/Hollywood film but
I have found some gems. I will keep you posted as to its progress but as I
am sure you appreciate a video like this is a little more ambitious than any
of my previous attempts.

<p>
I trust you are well, along with the goslings ;)

<p>
Take care now my friend.

It's good to see you back at it. I tried to view the video, but got a consistent message about

And yes, I am well, and so are the geese, thank you.
