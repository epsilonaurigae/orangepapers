Subject:  	I found your article interesting<br>

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html</a>

<p>
Are you privy to A.A. statistics?  Your article is well-supported, but your
assumptions are bold.  One in particular is describing sobriety as &quot;dry for x
months, years&quot; etc.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Patrick,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I'm not sure what you are referring to there. I cannot find any line in that file
where I defined sobriety as &quot;sober for X amount of time&quot;.  It helps a lot if people
use exact quotes so that I know what they are talking about.

</font>
<p>
Having been a newbie, and seen other newbies...indeed..some self-doers,
professionals and cold-turkey types.  My father has been dry for 15 years.  I can
tell you with no reservation that he is not sober.  There are heavy drinkers/users
who quit cold-turkey without A.A. or N.A.  Then there are alcoholics/addicts that at
some emotional bottom turn to A.A..

<p>
<font color="blue">
If your father has not drunk any alcohol for 15 years, then he is most assuredly sober.
Now his behavior may not meet with your approval. He may not be nice.
He may not even be sane. But he
is sober, and he has been sober for 15 years.
<p>
That is a classic example of
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak" target="_blank">
how Alcoholics Anonymous twists the definitions of the
words</a> and rewrites the English language (as if they had any right to do so).
Alcoholics Anonymous does not get to redefine the world &quot;sober&quot;.
<p>
And that is nothing new &#8212; &quot;Loading the language&quot; is
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak" target="_blank">standard cult behavior</a>.
It's also
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#loading" target="_blank">standard brainwashing technology</a>.


</font>
<p>
It is the fellowship of understanding, being understood,  self assessment, working
the steps, addressing emotional and spiritual emptiness, making ammends in good
time, and giving back that keeps people sober.  And that term is starkley different
than being dry.  For an alcoholic, remaining dry for the rest of your life could
never give you the inner peace that sobriety does. Why not?  Because alcoholism is
not just about an addiction, it is about bad thinking and an inability to emote
effectively.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are trying to redefine &quot;sober&quot; into something else, like
<i>&quot;A.A.-approved behavior and attitudes&quot;</i>. No. The word &quot;sober&quot;
means that you don't have any alcohol in your body.
<p>
And the rap about &quot;inner peace&quot; seems to be just so much self-delusion.
I get far too many
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="_blank">horror stories
from A.A. members and ex-A.A. members</a>
to believe the jabber about
&quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;inner peace&quot;.
<p>
Do you even feel that &quot;inner peace&quot; while
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the sexual predators are exploiting the
young girls who come to Alcoholics Anonymous seeking help</a>?
What are you going to do about that while you are feeling so serene and grateful?
</font>
<p>
And frankly, the testament is the people you meet...in every city or town.  People
you knew drunk, know sober, do business with, are friends with that show the results
of success.  Thousands upon thousands of sober, not dry, human beings.  I have not
once experienced a tone of arrogance or holier than thou attitude from my fellow
A.A. members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, quitting drinking often improves peoples' behavior. But A.A. does not deserve
the credit for that.

</font>
<p>
If I'm an apple, I can be the best apple I can be...but I'll never be an orange.
So, the statistics don't apply.

<p>
Peace

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, statistics do apply, just like how they apply to any other medicine or
treatment being tested. And A.A. failed all of the tests. A.A. does not make people
quit drinking.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">A.A. does not increase the amount
of sobriety in this world</a>.
That counts.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
As I've said before, that's a lively website you have there. Would you like some
more fuel for the fire?

<p>
Here, in part, is a description of an Oxford Group meeting published in 1934 by the
great American man of letters Edmund Wilson.

<p>
I came across it in Wilson's &quot;The American Earthquake: A Documentary of the Twenties
and Thirties&quot; (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1958).

<p>
The title is: &quot;Saving the Right People and Their Butlers.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;   ... The whole occasion makes an impression infinitely sad and insipid. I have
seen these people before: these people whom their work does not satisfy, these
people who are coming to realize that their functions in society are not serious and
to seek anxiously for something to hang on to which will give them an anchor outside
it all. If they were a little more uncomfortably neurotic, they would be going to
psychoanalysts; if they were sillier, they would be nudists; if they were cleverer,
Gurdjieff would get them. But the house parties, the butlers and the ballrooms of
the First Century Christian Fellowship seem to be just what is needed for these
particular cases. It has been the great achievement of Frank Buchman to put
patent-leather pumps on the Christ of the missions and get him into a dinner jacket,
and to give him for Mary Magdalene a refined Anglo-Saxon lady, chastely but
expensively gowned. They have invested Him with the fatuous cheerfulness of the
people in American advertisements and of the salesmen who try to sell you what they
advertise. One of the characteristic features of the Oxford Group is the continuing
chuckling and bubbling, the grinning and twinkling and beaming which goes on among
its members, and which makes an outsider feel quite morose ...&quot;

May 11, 2009, Monday: Day 11, continued:<br>

<p>
When evening came, Carmen's family decided to leave. I snapped a picture of them swimming
away, and then noticed that there were only four goslings following the parents.
I was afraid that Carmen had somehow gotten separated from her new family, and was
getting left behind. But I couldn't find her anywhere.

</center>
<p>
I couldn't believe that Carmen could somehow just suddenly lose her family, after
successfully staying with them for four days.  And yet, there were only four goslings
following the mother home.
<p>
I followed the family around the bend, but then lost them. I saw many other geese
and their goslings,
and found our friend &quot;Beethoven&quot;, the Great Blue Heron, but no Carmen.

</center>
<p>
This is our resident Great Blue Heron. It is an endangered species, but this one is
individually anything but endangered. It's quite tame, and likes to hang out on the docks
and mooch fish from the fishermen.  It is intelligent enough to know that the fishermen
have to throw the small ones back, so he hangs around and gets them. He also gets
whatever extras the fishermen don't want. Whenever fishermen are fishing from the docks,
Beethoven usually shows up and perches up on one of the tall posts that anchor the docks,
peering over the fisherman's shoulder like a vulture, waiting for dinner.
The fishermen all know him and like him, so Beethoven makes out like a bandit.

Beethoven actually swallowed the fish whole. (2007.11.05)<br>
</center>

<p>
I call him Beethoven because he looks just like Beethoven when the wind messes up his &quot;hair&quot;.
With the glaring stare and his wild-haired look, he really does resemble Beethoven.
Here is a photo of Beethoven from previous years, up on one of the posts, vulching:

Beethoven the Great Blue Heron, all wild-haired and glaring (2007.11.04)<br>
</center>
<p>
But there is one big problem with Beethoven: no Mrs. Heron.  Year after year, he has no mate.
I keep bugging him and telling him, &quot;Go get an old lady. I want to see lots of little cheeping
chicklets. You're an endangered species. Go reproduce.&quot;
Still, no luck yet.

<p>
Well anyway, I was talking about Carmen being lost. I couldn't find her or her family anywhere.
They swam off somewhere and disappeared. Finally, all I could do was give it up and go home and
hope for the best.
<p>
May 12, 2009, Tuesday: Day 12:<br>
<p>
I came back to the river bright and early the next day to see if I could find
Carmen. And I did. The whole family was there, acting as if nothing had happened. There they are,
with all five babies:
<p>
<center>
<img src="/web/20161103231309im_/https://www.orange-papers.org/P20090512_213-Carmens_family.png" border="0" width="800" height="599" alt="Canada Goose family"><br>
Carmen's family, the next day. (2009.05.12)<br>
</center>
<p>

I was puzzled by the whole thing, and couldn't figure out how Carmen could get lost and unlost so
easily, so I went back and studied the photographs again. I zoomed in on the photograph of
them swimming home the previous evening: 
<p>
<center>

Carmen's family, swimming home.<br>
</center>
<p>
And then I saw it. Do you see it?
<p>
I'll give you a couple of big hints:
<ul>
<li> The father is in the lead, and the mother is following
him, and the four goslings are following her.
(Ignore the male Mallard Duck that is in front of them.)
<li> The father's wings are laying down flat on his back the way that they should.<br>
The mother's wings are pushed up in the air, as if she has a lump of something under her
wings, keeping them from laying down flush against her body.
</ul>
<p>
Yes, there was a lump under the mother's wings, all right, and that lump is named Carmen.
Carmen wasn't lost or separated from the family. She was taking a warm nap under the
mother's wings, and pulling her &quot;refusing to leave the mother's warm embrace&quot; stunt again,
and getting a free ride home.

<p>
Talk about lazy. She doesn't even bother to swim home. She just climbs into bed and lets
the mother carry her home.

<p>
And then I reminded myself that I really shouldn't worry so much.

Subject:  	Your web site on AA<br>

<p>
Dear Sir.

<p>
It is quite obvious that you have no idea what it is like to be tormented by an
addiction. Or to live with someone who has. Thank G-d. I am a recovered alcoholic
and I have the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous to thank for that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tovah,
<p>
Yes, I do know what it is to be tormented by addiction. I also know what it is like
to stare into your own grave, and have the doctor say, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
<p>
Claiming that I don't know anything about alcoholism or addiction is such a lame old
A.A. attack. I can't count how many Steppers have tried to use that particular
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i></a>.
Rather than debating the facts, they just want to claim that I don't know about
addiction.
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Oh, you don't know how bad it is. You don't understand the suffering that
alcoholics go through.&quot;</i>
</font>
Actually, I do know, and I do understand, because
<a href="orange-letters124.html#autobio" target="_blank">I've been through it myself</a>.

</font>
<p>
Therefore I am very aware of what happens and what is said and what the meanings are
of our Big Book and the 12 steps. Unfortunately Sir you are Not.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's more of the same <i>ad hominem</i>.
</font>
<p>
Firstly do you know of any other way for an addict or alcoholic to successfully live
without his drug of choice. AA is the most successful method and we are only a very
fortuante 5% of the world alcoholics to survive.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is totally wrong. That is exactly backwards &#8212; a complete
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_denial" target="_blank">reversal of reality</a>.
(Reversal of reality is a common cult characteristic.)
<p>
There are several other better ways to recover, and other recovery groups,
and A.A. is actually the <i>worst</i> way to recover. Nothing produces a higher
death rate.
<ul>
<li>
See the list of
<a href="orange-letters124.html#alt_list" target="_blank">better recovery groups, here</a>.
Also see
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231309/http://www.rational.org/" target="_blank">Rational Recovery</a>
and
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">the Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
<p>
<a name="tests"> </a>
<li>
Read about the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. rate of binge drinking here</a>,
<li> the <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">A.A. increased rate of rearrests</a>,
<li> the <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">A.A. increased cost of hospitalization</a>,
<li> and the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">appalling A.A. death rate, here</a>.

<p>
<li>
Furthermore, the recovery rate from alcoholism is not 5%.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Medical School
put the alcoholism recovery rate
at over 50%</a>, and said that 80% of those who successfully recovered did it alone.
Five percent is just
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">the miniscule A.A. retention rate for the first year</a>.
</ul>
<p>
So you are not &quot;the lucky 5%&quot;. Again, that is
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="_blank">
another standard cult characteristic: &quot;We are special.&quot;</a>
</font>
<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
In fact i hope that nobody who is in need of help from a 12 step program reads the
misinformed drivel that you have written. Most unrecovered alcoholics either end up
dead or locked up in a psych ward with wet brain.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And there it is again: the standard A.A. claim that telling the truth about A.A. will
harm alcoholics.  You are just spouting all of the standard A.A. lines, aren't you?
<a href="orange-letters103.html#disservice" target="_blank">Look here for more
of the same parrotting</a> of
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;You are doing a great disservice to those who are seeking sobriety.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Telling the truth is a good thing, not a bad thing.
Alcoholics and other addicts need more true information, not less.
</font>
<p>
I suggest Sir before you write anymore injurous drivel of this nature that you do
your homework and at least get the facts correct even tho you won't understand them.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I've done my homework. Read
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">the bibliography</a>.
Read the whole thing. You don't have to read all of the books
listed there, like I have. That would take you years.
Just read the list of books. And notice that the list
starts with the &quot;Big Book&quot; <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, and includes all of the
council-approved books that I've been able to get my hands on.
<p>
Have <i>you</i> done your homework? How many anti-A.A. books have you read?
</font>
<p>
In the end you are no different from the person that you are attacking. What
qualifications do you have to write such drivel. Obviously none, otherwise you
would'n have written what you did.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Qualifications? That is yet another <i>ad hominem</i> attack, just a dodge to avoid
talking about the real issues, like the A.A. failure rate, and the A.A. death rate.
The truth is that the facts, like the &quot;appalling death rate&quot;, speak for themselves.
It doesn't matter whether I, or
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. George E. Vaillant
the A.A. Trustee</a>, or Donald Duck
reports the facts &#8212; the facts are still the facts.
Attacking the speaker does not change the facts.

<p>
Well, anyway, I do have some qualifications to talk about alcoholism and addictions and recovery.
Start with far too many years of experience with alcoholism
and addiction to tobacco, and many years of taking or trying out every drug available,
and then successfully quitting for three years, and then relapsing and
going out for another nine years, and then quitting again
and staying quit, and then many years of study of what works and what doesn't,
and many years of seeing friends and aquaintances succeed or fail in their attempts
to quit their addictions.
And include the 8 1/2 years of sobriety that I now have.
<p>
Again, what recovery methods besides A.A. have you studied? What is your education on the subject?

<p>
The book of Alcoholics Anonymous strongly reinforces any alcoholic to seek medical
advice if neccessary. In the early days of painful recovery anti-depressants are
most definately advised for many alcoholics.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that is a typical A.A. weasle: Bill Wilson said that sick alcoholics should maybe
seek a doctor's care (if they wish). But he also said that A.A. was better than doctors.
<p>
It's just another standard A.A. bait-and-switch trick.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#doctors" target="_blank">First, they will tell you to see a doctor, and say
that &quot;we know only a little&quot;, but then it's &quot;We know
more than doctors&quot;,

And then the <i>Big Book</i> prints a story where a newcomer read the <i>Big Book</i>

And above all, the problem remains that many people who go to A.A. are soon told
to stop taking their medications and just trust the 12 Steps to heal them.
That is quackery and faith healing at its worst.

I myself, have heard more than a handful of
stories of people I KNEW in AA over the last 17 years, who, on the
advice of their sponsor, stopped taking medication and as a result
committed suicide because their depression was untreated. A.A.er's

That means that newcomers have a one-in-six chance of getting a sponsor who might
kill them with bad medical advice. That really is Russian Roulette.
<p>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
<b>The official A.A. web site actually acknowledges that
A.A. members have pushed newcomers into suicide by telling them not to take
their medications.</b>
Their conference-approved pamphlet, &quot;The AA Member &#8212; Medications &amp; Other
Drugs&quot;, on page 13 states
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Because of the difficulties that many alcoholics
have with drugs, some members have taken the
position that no one in A.A. should take any medication.
While this position has undoubtedly prevented
relapses for some, it has meant disaster for others.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
AA members and many of their physicians have described
situations in which depressed patients have been told by AAs to throw away the
pills, only to have the depression return with all of its difficulties, sometimes
resulting in suicide.

We have heard, too, from schizophrenics, manic
depressives, epileptics, and others requiring
medication that well-meaning A.A. friends often
discourage them from taking prescribed medication.
Unfortunately, by following a layman's
advice, the sufferers find that their conditions
can return with all their previous intensity. On
top of that, they feel guilty because they are
convinced that &quot;A.A. is against pills.&quot;

</blockquote>

<p>
Of course the above wishy-washy back-and-forth apologetic quote begs the question:
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So which A.A. members, old-timers, or sponsors are
entitled to decide whether
<ol>
<li> the newcomer <i>should not</i> take medications,
in order to &quot;undoubtedly prevent relapse&quot;, or
<li> the newcomer <i>should</i> take medications, in order to prevent sickness or death?
</ol>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So who decides? Who has the knowledge and the power?
Which sponsors or old-timers are entitled to play doctor?

</font>
<p>
Also for many Al-Anon, obsessive compulsives, shopaholics, workaholics, addicts of
many varieties, you are down right insulting. The pain of these people is great and
their addictions just as deadly at times, and YES addictions are but symptoms of a 3
pronged problem which is mental, spiritual and physical.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What is insulting is telling those sick people that they are immoral and defective and need to get
right with God by confessing all of their sins, like the 12-Step program does.

Please do not insult those of us any more by writing your misunderstood, patronizing

Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I haven't seen any evidence that Bill Wilson as a Freemason. It seems to be a recurring
idea, though, as I've received that question before,
<a href="orange-letters55.html#Mason" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters55.html#Mason2" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters55.html#Mason3" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
I suspect that Bill Wilson thought that the circle and triangle design
on the dollar bill (the pyramid) looked mystical
or something, so he just copied it.  A few years ago, I was paging through a book of
mystical and religious symbols, and there were dozens of old symbols built around
the circle and triangle theme. So it wasn't really anything new, or restricted to
the Freemasons.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
I read one of your E-Mails about Clancy and the Pacific Group
in Los Angeles. The group started about 40 years ago and Clancy appointed
himself the all-knowing guru. It has grown over the years into a very
large cult. The women in the group complained about Clancy's sexual
exploitation for years. To my knowledge nothing was done about it.
<p>
When a
speaker speaks at conventions all of their costs are paid for by AA
members. I heard that for many years, when Clancy spoke he insisted that
they also pay for one of his girlfriends &#8212; often a newcomer. Even though
Clancy is married and often the women were also. Clancy says this is good
for the newcomers' self-esteem.
<p>
He often told newcomers to turn their will
over to him because anyone would make better decisions than they
themselves. When speaking out against this behavior you were told how
Clancy has helped so many people.
<p>
Please keep my name anonymous because
of retribution from cult members. The Pacific Group has taken over many
AA groups in the Los Angeles area. Truly a cult and a perfect example of
abuse of power and many of the things you mention on your site. 
<p>

P.S.:<br>
I found AA to be a fear-based male hierarchical cult of control and
domination.

P.P.S:<br>
Hi Orange,<br>
Clancy the self-appointed guru of the Pacific Group tells
women they have to wear dresses and men jackets when they participate
at their meetings. Men must not have beards. The idea is that conformity
is part of the so-called cure of Alcoholism. Very controlling male
chauvinist.<br>

Hey there Mister Orange.
<p>
I've been meaning for some time to commend you
for providing the best public service on the net: exposing religious cults
that masquerade as a self help group, namely, AA. Exposing cults of any  sort
is always a good thing in my opinion. But AA really needs to have  the
sunlight of truth shone upon it. AA is one of those things  that's simply taken
for granted, it's all pervasive, most laypeople simply  assume it must be a
good thing if judges make you go to meetings (that's  another story), even a
lot of AA jargon has become part of the  mainstream lexicon ie: sobriety,
relapse, sponsor, alcoholism, etc. It  never ceases to amaze me how little
people know of the true creation of AA.  But one only needs to do a bit of
research to learn of it's humble  religious cult beginnings. You offer many very
enlightening albeit  disturbing articles on the fascist dictator known as
Frank Buchman. And for that  I thank you. It further inspired me to read up
even more on the guy, and came to  the sad realization that there are many
buchmans born every minute. We got some  real choice scoundrels now, for
example: pat robertson, john hagee, benny  hinn, hacks like that. Looking back on
the 5 or 6 years I was in AA, I'm  still irked that all we're ever told of
the creation of AA was that it  started as 'the oxford group', and then it's
dismissed. Like an almost  insignificant footnote. When in fact it's a very
important fact that 'the oxford  group' were a simply a bunch of jimmy
swaggert type phony loonies that  people assumed knew a lot about Jesus.

<p>
<font color="blue">

<p>

I should have followed my  own gut instinct that very first
meeting. I suppose I should mention that a few  years before that first meeting, I
was in a cult that was  led by a very famous guru. I got sick of his rules
and deceptive  recruiting techniques and split. So here I am now, in a group
that's supposed to  be a fellowship of recovering drunks/addicts, but most
people  want to deify these two clowns bill wilson and dr. bob. AND
constantly  refer to that infallible holy scripture, the big book. So well written
isn't it? I could read if over and over.. Right. And I  could put out my eyes
with red hot pokers too.
<p>
There's a voice in my  head telling me to get the
fuck out. But I didn't listen. I hate when that  happens. You know, when you
should have listened but you didn't and you beat  yourself up for all
eternity. It is safe to say I hated AA from day one. But  after a while I would
try to work some 'steps', since so many cool people I  liked encouraged me
right (especially Jennifer)? Too bad I didn't know then how  brainwashed they
were too. Oh well.
<p>
<a name="thinking_about_it"> </a>
I admire you A.O., because you tolerate all  the hate
mail from the brainwashed AA faithful. They told me once or a zillion  times
that AA is a spiritual program. First off, I really don't know what
'spiritual' means, but I'm pretty sure I don't wanna be it, since the 'spiritual'
types I always meet in AA are repugnant, intolerable creepy,  repressed
wankers. In short, your typically boring, dreadful AA meeting. You usually leave
wanting to drink more than ever. In fact, you could go in there  feeling
good and wanting to remain abstinent, but now after all those glorious war
stories, you want to drink for the hell of it! Just don't admit that. Just say
it's your disease talking!

Hello Al,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. And of course I couldn't agree more
with what you said.
<p>
What really rang a bell in my head was the fact that meetings make you want to drink.
Other people have written to me saying the same thing, and I've experienced it myself, too.
I'd be fine before I went to an A.A. meeting, but I came out of the meeting thinking
about getting a big bottle and tying one on. I didn't do it, but I was thinking about it.
<p>
Likewise, I'd be fine before going to an N.A. meeting, but I'd come out of those meetings
thinking about getting some dope and getting good and high. I really felt like doing it.
The desire was strong. I could taste it, and I could smell it.
It felt like I would be coming home to the good old days.
Ah, it looked so good in my imagination.
I'm happy to say that I didn't do it, but those meetings really woke up the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">old Addiction Monster</a>.

<p>
I don't know if it was just the power of suggestion &#8212; an hour of people
talking about getting high, doing a stroll down old memory lane, planting
the idea in my head and awakening the desire &#8212; or whether I kind
of absorbed the desire by osmosis from the other people around me.
Whatever that phenomenon was, it was very real.
<p>
Maybe that is part of the explanation for why
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma
found that alcoholics who went to A.A.  did five times as much binge drinking</a>
as other alcoholics who got no such &quot;help&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot; at all.
<p>
It would seem like you are better off doing just about anything else besides going to
12-Step meetings and trading drunkalogues.
<p>
I joke about my daily meeting being with the geese down at the river, but lately, it
isn't a joke. I really do have a daily meeting there.
I've been feeding the goslings nearly every day, and seeing how they are doing,
and getting photographs of them. And you know, that meeting
has never made me want to drink or dope. The idea never even occurs to me. Those meetings
with the geese just make me go back to the supermarket and buy some more oatmeal for them,
which is what I just did an hour ago. Those children are bottomless pits.
<p>
Have a good day.

Today, 2009.06.24, a goose family with two goslings is having some lunch.<br>
The goslings are voracious eager eaters, rapidly growing children.
</center>
<p>
I put some oatmeal on a board for them, which works like a plate.
The two goslings are in front,
and then the mother is behind them, also eating, and the father is behind them, mostly
standing guard, and not eating much. The mother needs to eat &#8212; she is still recovering
from making those big goose eggs. Just like with a pregnant human mother, the babies take a lot
out of the mother, and now she is working on replenishing what she lost and
building her body back up. The father, on the other hand, isn't so hungry.
It doesn't take very many calories or a lot of protein to father children.

<p>
Those two goslings are 6 or 7 weeks old, I guess.  They grow so fast. They already have
feathers now, and they occasionally enthusiastically flap their wings and build up their wing
muscles. You can tell that they are already thinking about flying.
They don't have the big flying feathers on their wings yet, but they will very soon.
You can see the big feathers growing in the blue tubes right now.
That is, how they grow those large flying feathers is: they grow blue tubes out of the
back edge of their wings, one tube per feather, and then the feathers grow
all rolled up inside of the blue tubes.
When the feather is fully formed, then the blue tubes kind of dry up and burst
and fall away, and
the feathers unroll and flatten out and dry hard, and then the gosling has flying feathers
that can really push some air.

This motley-looking gosling has half baby down and half feathers covering its body. It has
allowed a wingtip to droop down, and you can see the blue tubes where the big flying feathers
are growing.

Your writing is fascinating.  Do you write about any other subject, other
than Bill and AA and the nature of addiction?  Just curious.

Hi Linda,
<p>
Thanks for the compliment. I'm glad you like the writing.
<p>
At present, I'm not writing anything other than this web site. But at the rate that
I'm going, I may end up
<a href="orange-letters118.html#goslings2" target="_blank">writing about goslings</a>.
