&nbsp; &nbsp; ...  &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p><li> Another old-timer
<a href="orange-letters29.html#oldtimers_story" target="_blank">writes about his experiences</a>
with &quot;the evil empire&quot;

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Pacific" target="_blank">
In AA, I have encountered countless people who are honestly spooky
and cult-like in their behaviors</a>.  Many of them belong to a subset of AA
that really creeps me the fuck out [that] is called The Pacific Group.

<p><li> 
<a href="orange-letters28.html#relationship" target="_blank">They were mad because I was getting married when I got back.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters32.html#AA_cult" target="_blank">
...after only a half dozen or so AA
meetings he began spouting crap i.e. the slogans, the higher power,  and
instinctively I began to feel that the whole AA thing was very creepy.</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters54.html#Natalie" target="_blank">
In January of 2005 I entered the doors of AA. This was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made in my life.</a>

<p><li> 
<a href="orange-letters57.html#sex" target="_blank">
Firstly, I'm stricken by how firmly AA has held on to it's lecherous,
predatory roots of older men attempting to take advantage of vulnerable
women seeking help. After attending only a handful of meetings it became
clear to me that I could only possibly attend women-only meetings.</a>

<p><li> 
<a href="orange-letters58.html#tx" target="_blank">
However, one of the clauses in the contract stated that it was &quot;recommended&quot; that I attend AA meetings three times a week.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters59.html#crashed" target="_blank">
I crashed and went into depression when I realized that a lot of other people were ignoring me after a while, because I didn't do it their ways.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters60.html#Wolf" target="_blank">
It took a decade and a half of me freezing out my well educated and civilized friends and colleagues in favour of people in various states of damage and recovery to realize that I was not keeping company that helped me much, if at all.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters60.html#Amber" target="_blank">AA gave my dad's selfish, violent behavior justification.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters97.html#Carol2" target="_blank">
When my gut instinct screamed at me to, &quot;Get Out!&quot; of AA, I was really
sick and getting sicker with every meeting.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters97.html#na_cult" target="_blank">a sad story of Narcotics Anonymous,
the &quot;sexual, social cult&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters68.html#horror" target="_blank">I've been pathologized for twenty years. I can't go back there.
...
I had one of those &quot;dual lives.&quot; Like AA convinced me that my &quot;nice&quot; friends could never accept &quot;my disease.&quot; When I got sick, (with a real disease), I lost a lot of my nice world, and only AA was left. It has been hell.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters150.html#Amber" target="_blank">holding a parent's children hostage until they go to AA or NA is just wrong.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters178.html#horror" target="_blank">I had NO IDEA that these programs were like this until I was forced to attend them.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters194.html#horror" target="_blank">I found his fawning, appeasing
attitude distasteful, and was offended by his single minded determination to get forgiveness from me.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters194.html#D" target="_blank">
I have noticed that you cannot criticise AA in meetings. You cannot discuss the
steps in a rational way. You are expected to blindly accept everything about the 12 steps.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters29.html#horrors" target="_blank">I have been
haunted by this program for almost 30 years now.  Often, I would just
give up and resign myself to drinking, rather than submit to AA.</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters5.html#shunned" target="_blank">
I used to attend the badger group in waukesha, the biggest aa cult in waukesha</a>...
What has always been shocking to me is the
rationalization of a death after a person has quit taking their meds
under the so-called direction of their sponsor.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters5.html#horror2" target="_blank">
I didn't like being called insane. I didn't like being told not to think. I didn't
like being attacked when I asked questions. I didn't like being told that
&quot;Your best thinking got you here&quot;.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group" target="_blank">The Q Group:
Young women have been raped by much older men. My old sponsor had sex
with a 14 year old girl and he is in his 30's</a>.
He acted like it was no big deal. I mentioned to him that such things
are wrong. He said &quot;who says so&quot;...

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">more Midtown Group sexual exploitation of youths in A.A.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Midtown0" target="_blank">
There is much more about the &quot;Q Group&quot; or &quot;Midtown Group&quot; here</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Midtown13" target="_blank">
...the leader of the cult was stealing money from the group in the
thousands to go on his own personal vacation with his underage flavor
of the week.  There was indisputable evidence to confirm this, yet
still the &quot;higher-ups&quot; claimed this was okay because he was the leader
and he saved so many lives.  It wasn't till my sponsor essentially
gave me the option to swear loyalty to this disgusting prick or leave.
I chose the latter and am very glad for it.</a>

Washington DC has been reporting on the Midtown issue</a>

Then, they asked me to read the big book, which I did. And, that was when the doubt started to invade me. What was this all about? It was so stupid, so fascistic, so untolerant, so childish.</a>

You basically &quot;chose&quot; to feel miserable because you were a dirty, whining, lying bastard.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters13.html#horror4" target="_blank">
The Heaven's Gate suicides in 1997 disturbed me greatly, but when it happened I ran into
immediate opposition within NA to automatically making these people out to be wrong.</a>
&quot;We don't know they didn't take the right path,&quot; one guy told me.
On his arm was tattooed a self-immolating monk from the Vietnam protest. &quot;It's wrong to
judge.&quot;

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters74.html#genxjunk" target="_blank">
Unfortunately, AA does harm some people.  I've seen people ridiculed for not believing what they have
been 'suggested' to believe.  I've seen people degraded for not doing the
things have been 'suggested' to them.  I have seen AA's holier-than-thou
attitudes chase people away.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Why would someone who has double digit sobriety still go to a meeting every day, sponsor 10+ people and spend 3 out of 4 weekends at some type of service function?</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#horror2" target="_blank">
I thought I was going crazy and still feel guilty and neurotic at times when not &quot;perfect&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#Living_Dead" target="_blank">
...they decided to &quot;intervene.&quot; In the evening I heard numerous individuals (all women from her support group) knocking on my door and windows. I ran in the bedroom and hid. I felt like the zombies from Night of the Living Dead were coming for me.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors3" target="_blank">
*AA sabotage* (framed as a warning from a Good Samaritan, but really a character assassination) was the culprit for much of my grief. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; *AA sabotage* could get me fired from a job with a single phone call, or investigated with a complaint to the police.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters98.html#horror" target="_blank">
The way I stayed sober is almost the exact opposite of the 12 Steps, but of course I would never say this in a meeting. If you don't tow the party line, you are laughed at or ostracized. Even though I have almost 20 years, people would surely say &quot;He's going to be drinking soon.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters120.html#Newsweek" target="_blank">
But something about Midtown was not right. After a few months, the group's embrace of May began to feel like a chokehold. She says the sponsor assigned to give her moral support and help keep her sober pressured her to cut off ties to anyone outside the group. Another member snatched her cell phone and deleted names in the directory. She says she was pressured to stop taking the medication a doctor had prescribed to manage her bipolar disorder: group members told her she couldn't be sober if she was taking any kind of drug.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters126.html#horror" target="_blank">The leader of the group
was a man named Jerry S. This particular group was nicknamed &quot;Jerry's Kids&quot;.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp; About four years ago shockwaves erupted in the rooms
when Jerry wound up marrying a 15 year old girl who came to meetings seeking recovery.</a>.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters126.html#horror2" target="_blank">
My wife just informed me yesterday that she wants a divorce,
within hours after I forwarded to her the information that
I found on line from your web site</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters126.html#horror3" target="_blank">
A good friend of mine that came from another state, 38, married, good
life ahead, changed noticeably after some dickhead gave him the Big Book,
he told me about it but I never told him what I knew about A.A., and
he killed himself last year.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters129.html#horror" target="_blank">
I left unnanounced with the distinct feeling that I had been the
&quot;designated failure&quot; in the group from the start.
One of my friends in a different group experienced exactly the same thing.
I expect this is a standard cult tactic to make the &quot;insiders&quot; feel more...
inside. Or maybe just weed out the people who detect that this is all just a bunch of crap.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters132.html#horror" target="_blank">
&quot;They really seduce you
at first, just like someone with narcissistic personality disorder does when
they are looking for their supply. But then as the relationship progresses,
the constant devaluing begins, as you are only there to give them what they need.
Then ultimately, the victim is depleted and discarded.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters134.html#horror" target="_blank">
The thing that really stuck out for me was the information about the Synanon games and
the cult that used them, and their psychopathic leader. What is really
very disturbing is that they use that very method at the main rehab
center here on O'ahu.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters135.html#Tony" target="_blank">
I can't even recall the number of people I have seen torn apart during
my seven years in AA in London.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters143.html#Jason" target="_blank">
I had no drinking problem or drug problem but went to try and help with my
gambling addiction. &nbsp; &nbsp; I finally started saying I was an
alcoholic so I could fit in. I really became an Alcoholic due to going so much...</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters148.html#horror" target="_blank">
I recently lost two friends in August 2009. One to severe alcoholism (he had major family history of the disease) he had been to meetings and rehabs all over the continent &#8212; didn't help. I lost my second friend to AA.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters149.html#horror" target="_blank">My sister died last month, I don't blame AA completely but I feel that they definitely contributed to her death</a>.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters159.html#horror" target="_blank">I can control my drinking but I can't control the AA person she has become.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters168.html#horror" target="_blank">
It didn't occur to me at the time that my insurance card was about to become their personal credit card.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters173.html#horror3" target="_blank">So I grew up having bits of the 12 step ideology fed to me. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; As she tells the story to her friends now, she waited until I was weak and vulnerable to force me into the program. And she's *proud* of that.</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters173.html#horror4" target="_blank">
Okay, so now I tell my &quot;sponsor&quot; about what happened. Her response was
&quot;there was a womanizer in the meetings that she was from. Even though he
did those things to those women, he still carried a great message.&quot; Oh my god.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters180.html#horror" target="_blank">
I started to think that if after years clean and doing all these steps people still seem as stuck in the rounds of divorce, out of control children, affairs, lack of cash, unhappiness, relapses etc I wonder what good NA is doing for them exactly?</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters184.html#horror" target="_blank">
the resident drug and alcohol counselor invited me into a quiet room where he absolutely GRILLED me over the idea that I was an alcoholic. ... Now, the kicker is that he had no degree. He was just the resident 12 step old timer who was given a job to herd people into AA. He proceeded to grill, badger, and try to cajole me into AA.  &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
...my older brother left for a program similar to mine to quit drinking too.   &nbsp; ... &nbsp; 
When he came back, he was much, much worse.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters187.html#horror" target="_blank">
It was then when I realized that I have absolutely no connection to these people.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters189.html#horror" target="_blank">
i'm writing to you to raise the very bad subject of paedophiles operating within AA.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters198.html#horror" target="_blank">
As soon as I divulged that &quot;The God of my understanding&quot; is God Almighty</a>
(God The Father, God The Son, God The Holy Spirit) &#8212;
I noticed a HUGE change.  I experienced being ostrasized, I was keenly made aware
that I was the &quot;joke in the room&quot;.... people laughed when I &quot;shared&quot; anything. I saw
people in the room nodding their head, rolling their eyes at the ceiling,
snickering, putting their finger up to their nose and looking in my direction.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters200.html#horror" target="_blank">stop taking medications to please A.A.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters209.html#horror" target="_blank">
Since he found AA our life together has been a living nightmare. He stopped communicating... My
husband left me this past week (with 6 children still at home),
choosing his AA family over us.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters211.html#Sean_W" target="_blank">A letter from someone who knew him: Tom Powers, the co-author of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> was a crazy scheming lying child-molesting con-man who never stopped drinking.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters212.html#horror" target="_blank">My first sponsor ... starts screaming at me
because she knew I took medication for some mental illnesses I have.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters212.html#horror2" target="_blank">
He [my sponsor] laughed at me saying that the way I was going I could give up
[drinking] for a month or two, but then I would go on binge and would either die
or end up in prison...</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters214.html#RC" target="_blank">It's all bullshit....
and I paid the price for this quackery for far too many years</a>.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters216.html#Sarah" target="_blank">
My sponsor with 22 years
sobriety behaved like a dictator in my life TELLING me what to do.. 
... My sponsor found out I was on medication and told
me to stop taking it... she then in an open meeting addressed me being
on medication and the meeting proceeded to be a SHIT ON SARAH FEST for
being stupid to allow myself to be medicated!!!!</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters216.html#J" target="_blank">
...every time I felt even a minute amount of any undesirable emotion (sadness,
depression, boredom) [I was told] that I just needed to get busy and get with the
program! Not a word was ever said to me about actually addressing why I felt the
way I did and that it was okay to feel normal human emotions!!!</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters219.html#Renee" target="_blank">
The crap these people taught about medication was reprehensible. I stopped taking medication after MY sponsor called me out on my Prozac.... I was shamed into stopping it.</a>
