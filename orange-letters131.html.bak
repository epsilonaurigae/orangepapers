Hello Mr. Orange,

<p>
What can I say, I'm glad to have found your web site and think that the work you are
putting into your side of the argument is very interesting. Anyhow I have quite the
story and could use some help connecting to others in my area who have left the 12
step program and what it was like for them.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Brian,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>
Im going to send this email to see if you respond then I will send you my story
should you be interested.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, I'm responding. I'm always interested in stories. My personal experience is limited,
but lots of other people have experiences too.
</font>
<p>
what do you know about therapeutic community models? I went to one, worked there for
four years and had to leave as my intuition and that little voice in my head
realized how messed up the whole thing was. I need to talk to other surviviors of
these places, as I've been suffereing from PTSD since I left and still feel guilty
when I speak badly about this place, the program and how I had to get out.........

<p>
Signed,

<p>
Convinced I'm going to die without them.....lol.....

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Therapeutic community models&quot;...
That sounds like either a technical term or a euphemism that could hide a lot of evil.
Everything from
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon" target="newwin70">Synanon</a>
to
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Miller_Newton2" target="newwin69">Miller Newton's <i>&quot;KIDS of North Jersey, Inc.&quot;</i></a>
to 12-Step treatment centers qualifies for such a label.

<p>
I may be cynical, but I tend to think that &quot;therapeutic community model&quot; means
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;Here's our goofy idea of group therapy.&quot;</i></font>

<p>
And I recall that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#therapeutic_group" target="newwin71">Dr. George E. Vaillant also bragged</a>
about the success of the Alcoholics Anonymous
&quot;therapeutic group processes&quot; when A.A. had nothing to show
from 8 years of &quot;helping the alcoholics&quot; except an elevated death rate.

<p>
But I'm very interested in hearing your experiences with &quot;Therapeutic community models&quot;.

Have a good day.

Greetings.

I just wanted to say thank you for all the information provided in The
Orange Papers.
<p>
I have had a horrible time trying to find information that supports what
I've known all
along about AA and like minded groups. And it was refreshing to come across.
<p>
Being Atheist and having difficulty with chemicals put me at odds with the seemingly
only recovery method any health care professional knows of... 12 step.
I state facts to people involved with it and am treated like I'm either not
trying hard enough, simply don't want to be sober, or are just plain mad.
<p>
And I just wanted to say thank you for the glimmer of truth in the sea of
bullshit.

One thing that really rang a bell for me was the line,

I know that feeling, because alcohol destroyed my ability to concentrate and be an excellent

Hello

Before I ask you a bunch of questions I would like to know if you are sober now and
what is the source or reason for your cynicism against AA. I was approching my
sixth step when I googled character defects and found your website. I agree with
much of what you say but before I go up against the hard corps I need to know a
little more of your reasons for your dislike of the program. The fact that the
&quot;think&quot; sign was upside down when I first walked into the &quot;rooms&quot; gave me pause
right of the bat but I kept an open mind and gave it a try. I'm about to &quot;go out&quot;

before I do I need some ammo and solid facts.

My biggest objection to A.A. is that it does not work.

From:  	&quot;pr&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Hello...<br>

<p>
I am deeply saddened by your experiences in AA (although a group counseling
session isn't AA as I know it). I have been sober now for five and a half
years, and while I did swallow a good deal of doctrine in my first year, I
feel that the meetings, the step work, the taking meetings to people in
detox, provided me enough time to have an opinion about the efficaciousness
of the program of AA.
<p>
The AA group to which I belong is very different from what you describe (not
least of all with regards to success rate), as there really is no dogmatism
with regards to how you access (at least not what shape it's supposed to
take) God as you understand God. I don't think I would have stayed, wouldn't
have been able to swallow it, were it some form of Christian sect in
disguise. We have, for instance, avowed atheists in our group with many
years of sobriety, and they are well respected members.

<p>
I am glad that you have been able to stop drinking all on your own, with no
help from anything but your own will and intellect. Perhaps you weren't
(aren't?) an alcoholic. Perhaps there is no such thing as an alcoholic. My
father died of symptoms resulting from his inability to stop consuming
alcohol, but that might have been weak will on his part. It's strange, I
used to either drink or obsess about drinking, and since going to AA, doing
the spiritual work outlined in the twelve steps (for me, at least, there
seem to be all the best parts of spiritual practices in there, although I
choose not to debase myself for imperfection), I do not have this problem,
and my life is, in all wises, much much better. I went a couple of years
with no meetings, staying in touch with members of the fellowship, and
didn't feel the need to drink. I think that maybe the only reason to keep
going to meetings is to help those who are first showing up, as was done
with me. Certainly my psyche has stayed aligned towards positive growth
without much effort after the first couple of years.

<p>
Whatever the case, I wish you well. As a member of AA, I would like to
apologize that AA was unable to help you. It doesn't take much to give an
organization that, as I have been given to understand, only wants to help
people get better, a bad name. Certainly, I wasn't interested in AA until it
was the last thing I could think of to arrest my drinking and drug problems.
I don't know why I felt the need to write you, other than it made me very
sad to think of you however many years ago trying to get sober and not
finding any help in AA, which saved my life.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello PR,
<p>
First off, congratulations on your sobriety. And thanks for the letter.
<p>
While you feel that A.A. and its practices somehow made you quit drinking, you have also
said that you can go two years without any A.A. and still not drink, so A.A. isn't
really necessary, is it?
<p>
You try to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="newwin91">
minimize</a>
my criticism of A.A. by inferring that it was just a corrupt treatment center
that does bad things
&#8212; bad &quot;<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">group counseling sessions</a>&quot;.
Not so. I'm talking about all of the 12-Step empire,
not just obnoxious and dishonest treatment centers.
<p>
In the first paragraph, you speak of
<font color="black">
&quot;the efficaciousness of the program of AA.&quot;<br>
</font>
Sorry, but that is assuming facts not in evidence.
There isn't any &quot;efficaciousness of the program of AA.&quot;.
Every time A.A. has been properly tested for efficacy, it failed the test badly.
A.A. didn't help the alcoholics at all,
and A.A. had very nasty side effects too, like increasing the binge drinking and raising the death rate.
You can see the
<a href="orange-letters128.html#tests" target="newwin77">list of tests here</a>.

<p>
In the second paragraph, you said that you would have left if A.A. was
<font color="black">
&quot;some form of Christian sect in disguise.&quot;<br>
</font>
No, Alcoholics Anonymous isn't a Christian sect in disguise; it's a Buchmanite sect in disguise.
It's a bunch of stuff that
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="newwin79">Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a> made up.
A.A. theology is
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="newwin78">unChristian and heretical</a>, and it is
certainly not a part of Christianity.
<p>
In paragraph three,
<font color="black">
&quot;Perhaps you weren't (aren't?) an alcoholic.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Oh, is that an old dodge. So many A.A. members try to explain away my sobriety
by claiming that I'm not really an alcoholic. Funny that A.A. members just can't
stand the idea that I have successfully quit drinking without joining Alcoholics Anonymous.
It seems to drive them nuts.
<p>
For your information, my doctor said I was a real alcoholic. He said,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
My family agrees that I'm an alcoholic. All of my friends who really know me agree that I'm
an alcoholic. In fact, the only people in this world who declare that I'm not &quot;a real alcoholic&quot;
are A.A. members who just can't stand the idea that I'm still sober without A.A.,
and who are grasping for some explanation to avoid seeing
that their dogma is wrong &#8212; that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="newwin80">A.A. is not the only way</a>.
<p>
And note that those A.A. members know nothing about me except that I have 8 years of sobriety
without Alcoholics Anonymous.
But that one single scrap of information is enough for them to decide that I'm not a real alcoholic.
(By the way, that is <a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="newwin90">The Real Scotsman Logical Fallacy</a>.)
<p>
<font color="black">
&nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;My father died of symptoms resulting from his inability to stop consuming alcohol,...&quot;
</font>
<br>
Inability to stop, or refusal to stop?
<p>
Just because someone says that he wants to quit drinking, and then doesn't, does not mean
that he is unable to quit drinking. It just means that when the hangover wears off, getting high
again looks very attractive. That is a common problem. What an alcoholic wants in the morning,
when he is hung over and in pain and sick as a dog is totally different from what he wants
at night when the beers are popping and the ice is clinking in the glass.
<p>
By the way, my father died the same way too, and I almost followed in his footsteps.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	AA Secrets<br>

<p>
I was delighted to find this article, which corroborated my own views and
gave me further insight and knowledge.  I am grateful for what you are
doing, but how can the members of the rehab community who believe only in the
gospel according to Bill W be persuaded?
<p>
I recently spent 4 days in detox
(my first time ever... I had begun drinking 2 bottles of wine daily) and
when I was released the case manager insisted I do 90 AA meetings in 90 days.
I told her that I had strong philosophical and intellectual issues with
AA, since long before drinking had become a problem for me. She became
huffy and hostile and told me that if I found a better way to please let her
know and she would &quot;shout it from the rooftops&quot;....
<p>
I spent the next 3 days at home doing internet research, and have indeed
found a better way. I called the case manager and offered to send her some
information on that program (SMART Recovery) as well as other articles I
had found debunking the AA myths. She wanted absolutely no part of it.
<p>
Finally I politely told her that I felt she was doing a great disservice to her
current and prospective clients by being so closed minded and refusing to
offer alternatives. She hung up on me.
<p>
Well, I tried. What can be done
to get the word out? I know you are doing all you can, but how about
others? any ideas?
<p>
Thank  you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Naomi,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I hope you are feeling better now.
<p>
How do we get the word out? Just keep trying. Write letters and emails to your
Senators and Congressperson, telling them what you have discovered about
the quackery that is rife in the &quot;recovery industry&quot;,
and requesting that medical fraud not be funded any more.
Likewise, letters and emails to your local newspapers. Also, write to
your local politicians. Often, state representatives and senators fund
local programs.
<p>
Then you could write about your experiences in a blog on the Internet.
Every little bit helps. Every voice that tells the truth helps to shift
public opinion, and that, in the end, is what determines funding of
taxpayer-supported programs, and misinformed public opinion
is what allows the frauds and quacks
to stay in business.
The 12-Step &quot;recovery industry&quot; has an immense publicity and self-promotion
propaganda machine that constantly cranks out more misinformation to
fool the general public into thinking that Alcoholics Anonymous is a good
thing and really works, and we have to counteract that propaganda by telling the truth.

<p>
You could also go on the SMART forums, and other forums, and talk to those people and get suggestions
and news from them.

<p>
And they should feel threatened. The times they are a'changin', and such
simple-minded quackery isn't going to cut it much longer.
<p>
Even worse, many of those professional counselors are actually true-believer members of the
12-Step cult themselves, and that is why they will not tolerate hearing any criticism of the
&quot;The Program&quot; or Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. And that's why they don't
want to hear about alternatives or improvements. That's why they insist that 
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="newwin55">A.A. is the only way.</a>&quot;
So I don't expect those people to learn or change.

I've been in and arround AA for over twenty years. I have not heard any of the
accusations you state here fullfilled except from the mouths of some have said this
about them selves.

<p>
&quot;If you can make the right about face and drink like a gentleman our hat's are off
to you&quot; is what I heard. Bill Wilson also stated many times that AA is not for
everyone.

<p>
Are you trying to make up a fake boogie man for some reason?

<p>
Why don't you like AA?

<p>
If you're not an AA guy why do you care?

<p>
Are you an athiest?

<p>
Respectfully,

<p>
Dale M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Dale,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
The fact that you haven't seen something does not prove that it does not exist.
<p>
Twenty years and you haven't heard about any of it?
That must be some unusual, angelic, isolated group you go to.
I heard about that kind of stuff in my first few
months of attending meetings:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Just go across the river, to the meeting at the St. Francis church,
and there is a guy over there who manages to sponsor every woman who walks
in the door. He gets them all. And he's teaching them more than just
the Twelve Steps.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And,
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;My first sponsor in Dual Recovery Anonymous had women all of the
time. I couldn't even get ahold of him, because he was always out with
some woman. I had to get a new sponsor just to be able to talk to my
sponsor. And my new sponsor said that he doesn't think the other
guy even is an addict &#8212; he just goes to the meetings to get the
women.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And then my friend who was going to Dual Recovery Anonymous was told to stop taking
his medications &#8212; by his sponsor and the other old-timers.
That also happened in the first few months.
<p>
And lest you grumble that D.R.A. isn't A.A., the same stuff goes on in all of the 12-Step monstrosities.

<p>
Some of the problems with Alcoholics Anonymous are:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
A.A. constantly pushes itself on other people,
by a variety of means, including using the criminal justice system and health care system
and treatment centers,
in spite of what 
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="newwin83">Tradition 11</a> says.
<p>
<li>
And A.A. promotes itself as
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="newwin55"><i>The Only Way</i></a>,
in spite of Bill's disclaimers and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="newwin83">bait-and-switch stunts</a>.
<p>
<li>
And A.A. spreads a lot of misinformation about alcoholism, addiction,
and recovery &#8212; like that the 12-Step program really works
to make alcoholics quit drinking and dopers to quit drugging, and alcoholics are <i>powerless</i>
over alcohol, so it isn't their fault and they shouldn't feel guilty,
but alcoholism is really just a symptom of underlying
sin and charcter defects and moral shortcomings, so it really is the fault of the alcoholics after
all, so they <i>should</i> feel guilty.
<p>
<li>
And A.A. does engage in sexual exploitation of minors, and telling newcomers to stop
taking their doctor-prescribed medications, and crimes like that.
Just lately, that has been documented by many newspapers, magazines, and television stations.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin85">Look here for the information</a>.
<p>
And it's also happening in
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="newwin86">Phoenix</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters87.html#Pacific" target="newwin87">California</a>, and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731064005/http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendID=185546838&amp;blogID=265904083" target="newwin88">Minneapolis</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters100.html#Bainbridge" target="newwin89">Bainbridge Island</a>,
too.
<p>
And earlier, I read the newspaper story about
<a href="orange-cult_a5.html#sexual_exploitation" target="newwin91">sponsors sexually exploiting
the newcomers in England</a>. And there, the old-timer
said the same thing as you &#8212; that he had never heard of such allegations before. How is it that
these 20-year old-timers cannot see what is happening in front of them for 20 years?

<p>
<li>
And that is just for starters. You can get a more complete list from the file
<a href="orange-not_good.html" target="_blank">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>
</ul>
<p>
Oh, and I'm not an atheist. (That is such a standard cultish A.A. put-down, as if
someone's religion determined whether he was qualified to analyze sobriety programs.)
Actually, it is none of your business what my religion is,
and my religious beliefs do not determine whether A.A. is a hoax with a quack cure for alcoholism.
Nevertheless, I don't keep my religious beliefs a secret either.
When asked, I will tell the truth, and I already have, several times, like
<a href="orange-letters30.html#hippie" target="newwin88">here</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;James B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Thank You so Much<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
AA is not mandated in my state.  However, if you wish to have a driver's license
reinstated following a DUI conviction, participation in a &quot;support group&quot; is a legal
requirement.  A person can try a support group other than AA.  Good luck ever
driving (legally) again.  Hell will freeze over first before the State will
recognize a &quot;non-traditional&quot; support group.

<p>
I am such an unfortunate.  Other than those occasions when I chose to impair my
abilities with alcohol, I have always been able to depend on my reasoning.  I
quickly discovered that AA does not have a clue as to how to cope with the likes of
me.  I am required to attend meetings but I refuse to sit quietly and listen to
utter bull-droppings.

<p>
The other day, I commented; &quot;My best thinking earned an electrical engineering
degree from a top big-ten university.  My best thinking earned an MBA and built a
career as an engineering manager.  It was the worst of the worst thinking that
resulted in me having to listen to this ridiculous AA nonsense&quot;.  And the big book
thumpers went ballistic.

<p>
I must confess to getting a bit of a twisted thrill from the thought that just maybe
I can cause one of the old-timers to become so enraged that they stroke-out or
suffer a heart attack.  Well, if I must attend, might as well make a sport of it eh?

<p>
I suggested that we dedicate one meeting per week to driver's license reinstatement
issues.  We can all trade character reference letters (which the state requires as
proof of having established AA support group network).  I was sternly told that only
&quot;old-timers&quot; were to give character references.  So I summarily ignored the
old-timers and announced an AA drunken legal problems support group anyway.  Turns
out that 80% of the regular meeting attendees are attempting to get license
reinstated.  The support group caught on like wildfire.

<p>
The old-timers hate my guts with a spittle invective passion.  Talking about a group
that can form resentment.  sheez.

<p>
I truly enjoy reading the clear-minded observations you graciously share.  I used to
sit in AA meetings and wonder; &quot;How can anyone possibly buy into this crap?&quot;  &quot;What
sort of deranged and deluded mind fabricated this dyslogia?&quot;  &quot;Rigorous honesty my
ass!&quot;  Orange my friend, at least you've help me understand where it came from.

<p>
I often find myself wanting to pass the message on to those who still suffer from
compulsive meeting attendance.  Your website an invaluable resource.

<p>
Ben B.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ben,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story and all of the compliments.
<p>
When it comes to that &quot;best thinking&quot; slogan, I like to point out that it <i>really was</i>
my best thinking that decided to quit drinking (and also to quit smoking and quit doping).
(It was my worst thinking that thought that I could consume large quantities of those things with
impunity &#8212; without it harming my health and wrecking my life.)
<p>
And it was my best thinking that decided to examine whatever might help me to quit and stay quit.
<p>
So it was my best thinking that got me to an A.A. meeting.
<p>
But of course they don't want to hear that &#8212; they just want me to confess that my thinking
is defective, so I should let a sponsor do my thinking for me.

<p>
The fact that 80% of the people in the meeting were just trying to get
their driver's licenses back reveals just how much Alcoholics Anonymous
is really a program of coercion and promotion, not attraction, like
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="newwin83">Tradition 11</a> says.

<p>
And the way that the old-timers hated you for taking the initiative and doing something
practical and helpful 
reveals just how insecure they are. They want you to venerate them, and babble about how wise
they are, and obey them, not set up your own support group... :-)
<p>
It reminds me of a cartoon from the sixties (that I can't remember the source of).
In a courtroom, a long-haired scuzzy-looking youth is standing before
an old judge, and the judge is snapping,
&quot;Show some respect, sonny! I had to kiss a lot of ass to get where I am!&quot;

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

Subject:  	hi<br>

<p>
thanks for your Web site. I think you have a very jaundiced view of AA. I
agree with, and lament, some of what you document. However, I have 19 years'
continuous sobriety since first going to AA. I arrived there an agnostic,
and am still agnostic, and have never been otherwise. I have fought some of
the things you criticize within AA groups, with success &#8212; such as
eliminating &quot;prayer cards&quot; with &quot;praying hands&quot; (explicitly Christian) on
one side and the group's meeting schedule on the other ... and I've
successfully fought efforts to give leftover $$$ to churches where meetings
were held, etc., etc. I have also been chairman of groups with a fair # of
religious people &#8212; and in both cases, my term ended up being 3x as long as
it was supposed to be, due to things running smoothly.

<p>
So, I would just like to convey that, in my experience it has been possible
to disagree with folks within AA, and to participate without becoming tied
in to religious brainwashing.

<p>
Just one man's opinions and experience.

Thanks,<br>

Hi Charlie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the comments.
<p>
Somehow, you seem to think that I am anti-religious, like that I would oppose giving
money to churches.
I am not anti-religious, and I don't oppose giving your left-over cash to a local church.
Better to do that than to send it to
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="newwin19">the criminals at the
A.A. headquarters in New York City</a>.

<p>
Rather than erase all symbols of religiosity like the praying hands from all
A.A. literature, why not just stop the
coercion of people into A.A.? Stop sentencing people to A.A., and
that will solve the Constitutional problem of a State-mandated
religion. Then A.A. groups can be as overtly religious as they wish.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Celebrity Rehab/Dog spelled backwards<br>

<p>
Dear A.Orange,

<p>
What do you
think of Celebrity Rehab? Is this not the end-game of the 12-Step movement &#8212; A
modern form of inquisition? Look at how the mass media has treated Lindsay
Lohan.. I heard her parrot some 12-step mantra about her life being unmanageable
after one of her much  publicized stints
in treatment.   What can be more personal than one's health
care and spiritual beliefs?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.  I think that Celebrity Rehab is wonderful &#8212; wonderful for revealing just
how bad &quot;treatment&quot; really is.
(I was recently talking about Celebrity Rehab in another letter,
<a href="orange-letters129.html#celebrity" target="newwin14">here</a>.)
Celebrity Rehab pulls away the veil of anonymity and lets everybody who reads the tabloids
see who is going into treatment now, and how soon they relapse after treatment.
When all of those movie stars and starlettes come out of rehab parrotting mindless slogans,
and then relapse a month or two later, it shows the public what a worthless circus the
whole rehab-treatment-center routine really is.
</font>
<p>

Stepism plays upon the wanton pettiness of the
masses enjoying a high tech form of witch burning. This is the segment of society
that fell for 8 years of  the chest
beater in a phony flight suit, and are  still true believers in stepism.  They have
us mired in 12-step treatment
centers like we are mired in Iraq.
<p>
Never is the basic question asked: What does having the big book have to do
with getting one's drivers license back?
How does finding God through the state-sanctioned 12-steps  make the streets
safer from drunk drivers? Instead, there is this hysteria to destroy the first
amendment with  oblique   punishments like whiskey plates, like the
scarlet letter,  which all hearken back
to the puritanical days of old.
<p>
This celebrity rehab seems  an ultimate ad hominem
attack; instead of
answering the basic question of 12-step treatments' effectiveness, they offer
up poor Lindsay Lohan as some sort of sacrificial lamb, denying her basic
freedoms and the right of privacy &#8212; all under the aegis of the irksome sanctimony
of the Stepists. They pillory celebrities instead of face their true
comeuppance that people nowadays  really
question the cost and effectiveness of 12-step treatment.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, and that questioning is good.
</font>
<p>
Ever since
I was first sentenced to AA I have had my suspicions &#8212; starting with the fact
that I had to attest to monthly attendance  in open court in front of my peers &#8212; 
including
my high school's civics class &#8212; about my &quot;anonymous&quot; meetings. Now I know,
thanks to your web site, that everything in AA is two-faced and cultish.
Only in
AA, for instance, do you hear people
brag about their humility.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, isn't that a laugh? Bragging about one's humility.
That's as good as a guy bragging about how he got rid of ego.
</font>

<p>
I just got done doing another round of enforced
attendance.  I could barely  keep tight lipped after all I have learned &#8212; apparently
they are now collecting phone numbers of AA members &#8212; so much for &quot;what you see
here, hear here, etc.&quot; &#8212; so I could not speak out lest someone report to the
court or something spiritual like that.

<p>
<a name="5bucks"> </a>
I wanted to ask: in tradition seven of the
12/12 Bill brags how he gave 5 bucks to &quot;our prize slippee&quot;, than uses that as
an example of how stingy the rest of AAers are who are not giving enough at
meetings.  Was that Hank P that he patted
on the head and sent on his way? Everyone in the meeting was hemming and hawing
about the iconography of Bill W.'s grand gesture to this &quot;prize slippee&quot;,
completely clueless about the true history of AA: It would  be easy to give away 5
bucks to anybody,
especially Hank P., if one were Wilson at that point in time of writing the
12/12 &#8212; Did he not score some bucks in the murky business dealings already with
the Big Book? What did Wilson
&quot;Do&quot; for a living? &#8212; there seems to be a lot of money he left to Lois and his
mistress in his Will?  I would have
brought all this up in the meeting, but like I said they are taking numbers now
( &#8212;and soon I bet there will be video monitoring!) When I heard all this I just
bristled though; and   then   they
brought up the anecdote of how Wilson
asked for money from the Rockefellers, but he was told AA had to fend for itself.
I thought he did receive some funds from the Rockefellers, but it was just not
as much as he wanted?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Correct. In the early days of A.A., Bill Wilson pocketed 
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#Rockefeller_04" target="newwin25">a stipend of $120 per month</a>
from the Rockefellers, while lecturing about
how A.A. had to be independent and make it on its own. And $120 was a lot of money in 1940.
That was enough to live on, minimally, but enough.
<p>
In his history of A.A., Bill Wilson wrote that
the younger Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., heir to the throne,
hosted a dinner for Bill Wilson and
Alcoholics Anonymous, which was attended by many of the richest and most famous men in
New York City. And Bill wrote that none of them gave Bill any money, like Bill hoped. But Bill didn't
mention his special side-deal arrangement with Rockefeller, where he got that stipend.
<p>
Then Bill Wilson had the gall to write 
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad7" target="newwin26">Tradition Seven</a>, declaring that A.A. should be
self-supporting and not accept outside donations.
<p>
In general, what Bill Wilson did for a living was collect royalties on the books published
by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., like the <i>Big Book</i>, 12X12, <i>A.A. Comes of Age</i>,
<i>As Bill Sees It</i>, and his Grapevine writings, and on and on.
That was what made him a millionaire. And
<a href="orange-BillWill.html" target="NewDocWindow">his wife Lois inherited
all of that</a> when Bill died.
She in turn
<a href="orange-LoisWill.html" target="NewDocWindow">left much of it to her relatives</a>
who weren't in A.A.
<p>
And yes,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Bills_royalties" target="newwin27">Bill Wilson cheated his co-authors out of royalties</a>
on both the <i>Big Book</i> and 12X12.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP" target="newwin27b">Tom Powers</a>,
who co-authored 12X12, quit A.A. in disgust when Bill cheated him, and
 moved to upstate New York, and started his own recovery group there.
<p>
<a name="from_Dr_Bob"> </a>
In the earliest days of A.A., before the royalties on the books built up to a comfortable level,
Bill Wilson was supported
by the &quot;Alcoholic Foundation&quot; office funds, in addition to the $120/month stipend
from Rockefeller.
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#wilson_income" target="newwin90">This link shows an old letter
from the A.A. headquarters</a>
that explained the finances of the Alcoholic Foundation and Bill Wilson.
What strikes me as a really glaring revelation is this line in the document:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;The arrearage of royalties payable to Dr. Smith has been cleared up, a large part of which he
generously turned over to Mr. Wilson.&quot;<br></font>
So Bill Wilson was even taking money from Dr. Bob, when Dr. Bob was desperately poor?
And that was after Wilson had argued that Dr. Bob should get royalties
from the <i>Big Book</i> because Dr. Bob was so poor and in dire straights.
What a scheming con artist Bill Wilson really was.
<p>
Bill Wilson always had his hand in the
till one way or another, like that he helped himself to, and frittered away, the publishing
fund that was supposed to pay for printing the <i>Big Book</i>.
See the files on <a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="newwin88">Birth of BigBook</a>, and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="newwin89">Birth of BigBook II: Financial Analysis of the Creation of the <i>Big Book</i></a>.

<p>
I doubt if the fellow that you mentioned in the 12X12 anecdote was Henry Parkhurst, because
&quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst relapsed and quit A.A. when
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#Parkhurst_cheated" target="newwin23">Bill cheated him</a> 
out of his share of the money and credit for the
<i>Big Book</i>.  Hank wasn't hanging around, he was gone, and he only came back to sell
his furniture to Bill, at which point Bill conned Hank out of all of his stock in the
publishing company (that was really named <a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="_blank">&quot;The 100 Men Corporation&quot;</a>, not &quot;Works Publishing&quot;).
Also, Henry Parkhurst wasn't &quot;a prize slippee&quot;. He was consistently sober for four years,
and didn't relapse until Bill betrayed him.
<p>
With anecdotal stories like that one in 12X12, we have no way of knowing
if it even really happened. Bill Wilson loved to make up
stories like that, where he bragged about how generous he was, giving $5 to a drunkard when
his wife really needed that money for groceries.
Bill Wilson had a whole lot of stories that showed how
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#denied_recovery" target="newwin47">important</a>
and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="newwin48">smart</a>
and
selfless and generous and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="newwin49">spiritual</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters51.html#war_record" target="newwin48">brave</a>
and
<a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html#failure_rate" target="newwin69">hard-working</a>
he was.  Oh, and he was also very
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#humility" target="newwin68">humble</a>, too.
<p>
And notice that Bill Wilson had an ulterior motive in telling that story,
and in talking about how people neglected to send money to the A.A. office
in New York (12X12, pages 162 and 163): Bill was appealing for people to
put more money in the hat, and for the individuals and groups to send
more money to the &quot;Alcoholic Foundation&quot; central office, so
that the office could give more money to Bill Wilson.  Bill declared that
if people didn't send more money to the A.A. headquarters, that the
overworked staff of two people, a secretary (Ruth Hock) and Bill Wilson, wouldn't
be able to answer all of the mail.

<p>
I don't know if Bill Wilson also got speaker's fees for touring the country and speaking at meetings,
but they almost certainly at least compensated him for travel expenses.
If he was collecting speaker's fees, he could have made a bunch of money that way too, because
he spent years touring the USA and grandstanding for A.A.

If there is
one thing I have regretted more in life it is every second I have wasted in
stepism. For years I had reservations, but I could not even express the
slightest dissent. Through your web site that I found that this is a phenomenon
called cognitive dissonance &#8212; like singing out of key. Nevertheless, there were
times and places there where cracks in the wall of deceit where the light of
reason shined through,  and one of which
I wish to care and share with you &#8212; the monologue of Shaun the Alky Angel of Parkland
Hall of how he found God.

<p>
Shaun had already
distinguished himself as a spiritual titan by sucker-punching a minor named
Toney who was talking to the same girl he was hitting on after a meeting.
Later, I am told that someone got so fed up with Shaun's B.S. that they left a
meeting after being cross-talked by Shaun, tried to walk it off,  and then returned
and got in a fist fight with Shaun right in the middle of it of the
meeting.  Parkland Group always was such a veritable wellspring of masterpieces of
mental heath.

<p>
Once Shaun
explained how he came to find God and deliver us the Truth in AA. He had been
in and out of AA not &quot;getting it&quot; ,  and
found himself  riding down the high way
footloose and carefree &#8212; &quot;hip slicking cool&quot; in the jargon of steplore &#8212; on
his Harley one fine sunny day, and
smuggling a ton of cocaine (drug talk in AA meetings, hmmm).  All of the sudden a
Dalmatian puppy ran across
the road and he struck it, and he really stressed the symbolism of it being a
black and white issue at that moment in time and space.  Signs and wonders. The poor
thing looked into
his eyes and then died in his arms &#8212; died for his sins!, and right then and there
he knew he had a higher calling, for Shaun the mental giant, in a stroke of
brilliance, spelled Dog backwards, and it spelled God!

<p>
I had been in
college studying all sorts of complex arguments about God's existence and then
I found myself in a room full of 20 people and all were awe-struck by
Shaun the Biker's spiritual experience of how fido became road kill. Instead of
building a fence to prevent any more puppies from being run down,
Shaun is in an AA meeting trying to recruit new members for his sober biker
gang. To think that after all my studies of ontological, cosmological theories
of God's being, the problem of evil, all I had to do was follow the revelations
that infamous Alky Angel of Parkland Hall &#8212; spell Dog backwards, and there you
have it.

<p>
&quot;Always remember, a cat looks down on man, a dog looks up to man, but a pig looks
man square in the eye and sees his equal.&quot; Winston Churchill.
