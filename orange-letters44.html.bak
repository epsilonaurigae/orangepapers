From:  	Lib<br>
Subject:  	moderation management and Allen Carr<br>

<p>

I just came across your site today and am very glad I did.  I'm
wondering if you have written anything on either moderation management
(moderation.org) or the Allen Carr &quot;Easy Way&quot; books.  I have been
involved with MM for a few years, but am questioning if their 9 to 14
drinks a week limit is doable for someone who has a habit of drinking
too often/too much, and even if it is doable, if it is even really
&quot;moderate.&quot;  I just read Allen Carr's book on drinking and it helped me
immensely. I see a lot of parallels in his book and yours. Thank you for
all that you have written and shared.

<p>

Lib

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Lib,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.
<p>
The question you are asking is a tricky one.

<p>
First, the easy part: Yes, I've written about MM and moderation.
In fact, I once met the founder of MM, Audrey Kishline. Here are some blurbs on MM:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters23.html#MM">Moderation Management and controlled drinking</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#MM">the book Moderation Management</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-Vaillant02.html#MM">Audrey Kishline rejoins A.A.</a>
</ol>
<p>
I've never read the Allen Carr stuff. I'll have to check it out.

<p>
Whether someone can drink moderately is an individual thing. Some people
can, and some cannot. I am one of those people who cannot. I can successfully
abstain from drinking for many years, without even too much trouble (I now have 5 years),
but I cannot drink moderately for even one week. I know, because 14 years ago,
I relapsed after 3 years of sobriety. Just one beer was the kiss of death.
One led to three which led to a six-pack the next day and the next, which led
to 12-packs and soon that led to countless cases...
I ended up drinking for another 9 years, until things really got bad.

<p>
But that is my personal problem; not everybody else's.
Some other people can learn to moderate. 
As I said in the paragraphs about MM linked to above,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1">the Rand Corporation found</a>
that the successful people who had stopped drinking self-destructively
were split between total abstinence and tapering off into
moderate, controlled, drinking.
<p>
Our individual problem is to figure out which half we are in.
Can we individually drink moderately and keep it under control?

<p>
Dr. Kenneth Blum, the doctor who discovered the first gene
for alcoholism (of 2 found), commented that he thought that
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS">genetic alcoholics cannot drink moderately</a>.
That makes sense to me. My father drank himself to death. His mother was an
alcoholic. I don't know where it came from before that, but alcoholism
definitely runs in my family and I discovered the hard way, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, that total abstinence is the only thing that works for me.

<p>
But that's okay. I'm happy with things the way they are.
It's really so much easier to not drink at all, to not even have it be
a question, than to obsess over when I get the next twelve-pack and the next and
the next, and when am I going to run out?
<p>
Now I don't begrudge the people who can have one now and then.
More power to 'em.
That's them and their lives, and it doesn't really have anything to do with me.

<p>
If you think that keeping your drinking down to the suggested limit is
too much of a chore, then maybe it is. Maybe you will also be happier
just not drinking at all.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life.

<p>

Thanks Orange.  I tried to moderate for several years, but it was more
trouble than anything else.  Reading Carr gave me the missing pieces
that allowed me to quit.  I do think MM is worthwhile, as it helps
people like me begin to look at their drinking.

<p>

Thanks again,

<font color="blue">
Hi again, Lib,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks.
<p>
I agree about moderation being too much bother &#8212; for me. Total abstinence works
great for me &#8212; it's actually pretty easy; moderation just doesn't work for me.

<p>
I just got ahold of the Allen Carr books, <i>The Easy Way to Quit Smoking</i> and
<i>The Easy Way to Quit Drinking</i>.
I was impressed. There is a lot of good stuff in there. He even touched on what I
call the &quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
He called it simply &quot;the little monster in the stomach&quot;,
and &quot;the big monster in the brain&quot;.
It's obvious that we are talking about the same thing &#8212; that nagging voice that whispers
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, it's been so long since we've had one. We've got it under control now.
We can have just one, for good old times' sake...
Just relax for a little while... It's okay now.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I can't count how many times that thing fooled me into smoking another cigarette, but
I ain't gonna get fooled again.
I can count with alcohol &#8212; it fooled me exactly once.
And I ain't gonna get fooled again.
Remember <i>The Who</i>'s song, &quot;Ain't Gonna Get Fooled Again&quot;?
I think that should be one of my theme songs now.
<p>

Have a good day, and a good life.

thanks for website!! Would be interesting to know if this (not so noble

From:  	Cris B.<br>
Subject:  	letter<br>

<p>

Am interested in this link between aa, religion and christianity? Where
do these aa members proclaim to be christian and is christianity a
requirement of membership? Do you have to be religious to be a member of AA?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Cris,
<p>
The answers to some of those questions are tricky.
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
Officially, A.A. members do not claim that A.A. is Christian. The official position of
A.A. is that you can be any religion you want, or have no religion.

<p><li>
At the same time, one of the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-rroot810.html">Dr. Robert Smith</a>,
was a fanatical member of the Oxford Group, which claimed to be Christian,
although
<a href="orange-rroot900.html">
contemporary ministers and priests complained</a> that it wasn't.
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban">The Vatican even banned the sect, twice</a>.

<p><li>
Christianity is not a requirement of membership in Alcoholics Anonymous. In fact,
it might be considered a handicap.
Many Christians have found
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Saddleback">strong anti-Christian attitudes</a>
in A.A. literature and practices.
Some people quit A.A. because they find it to be too anti-Christian.
<p>
To quote
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Playfair_antiChristian">
Dr. William L. Playfair</a>, the author of &quot;The Useful Lie&quot;,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In fact, the most striking evidence of the non-Christian nature of AA is in the
testimonials of its members. ...
Not one single reference
to the God and Father of Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ, as the one and only Savior,
can be found. This is especially interesting when one realizes that every other
kind of testimony is recorded. Out of the millions of AA members, surely AA
could have included <i>one</i> Christian testimony in a book filled with
testimonies! If anything, this book shows an anti-Christian bias.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Useful Lie</i>, William L. Playfair, M.D. with George Bryson, page 95.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The mildest thing you can say is that A.A. does not promote Christianity.


<p><li>
At the same time, A.A. is pulling a whole bunch of bait-and-switch tricks
where first you can believe anything you want, and then you should believe
what your sponsor and the group elders say (or else The Program won't work):
<ul>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives">Shifting objectives:
First the goal is to quit drinking, and then the goal is to
&quot;acquire faith&quot; and &quot;come to believe&quot;
in Bill Wilson's religion.</a>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_purpose">First, it's only a &quot;spiritual&quot;
alcoholism recovery program, and then it's a fundamentalist religion
whose 'real purpose' is to make you 'serve God'.</a>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#your_servant">First, God is your servant, and then you are a slave of God.</a>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience">First, expect a great religious or
spiritual experience, and then expect nothing.</a>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod">First, prospective new members are offered a
tolerant, open-minded &quot;spiritual&quot; program, but then they get
narrow-minded demands for belief in Bill Wilson's teachings.</a>

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#keep_your_religion">First, you can keep your own religion,
and then you can't.</a>

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#surrender2God">First it's &quot;Surrender to God&quot;
and then it's &quot;surrender to some A.A. members&quot;.</a>

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education">First, it's <i>&quot;any God as you
understand Him&quot;</i>, and then it's <i>&quot;You don't understand
God. You are 'confused' and 'prejudiced'.&quot;</i></a>
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious">First, declarations of Religious Freedom,
and then demands for Religious Conformity.</a>

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater">First, a loosely-defined &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
and then an explicitly-defined &quot;God&quot;.</a>

<p>

<p>

Where in the Twelve steps does it say Bill DEMANDED anything of GOD.
Bill seved God and his fellow man by TRYING to help the drunken mind
comprehend the availabilty of help. Mr. Orange, Were you ever a DRUNL ?

<p>

Steve

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steve,
<p>
Apparently, you aren't too clear on how the Steps work.

<p>
If your personal version of &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot;
doesn't meddle in this world and deliver miracles on demand, then
<ul>
<li> You won't get any power over alcohol, and your unmanageable life
won't get managed in Step One, and
<li> you won't get restored to sanity in Step Two, and
<li> God won't take care of your will and your life for you in Step Three, and
<li> your many &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; won't get removed in Step Seven, and
<li> &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot; won't talk to you in
Step Eleven, and give you secret messages and work orders and the &quot;sure power&quot;
to carry them out...
<li> And &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot; won't give you a &quot;spiritual experience&quot;
or a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; in Step Twelve.
</ul>
<p>
Oh yeh, and theoretically, somewhere in there, God is supposed to make you quit
drinking alcohol, too, even though the 12 Steps don't actually say that you are supposed
to quit drinking alcohol.

<p>
If God says, <i>&quot;No, you made your bed, so you lie in it. I'm not going to do your
work for you.&quot;</i> then the 12 Steps cannot possibly work. They are useless.
<p>
God <i>must</i> 'Work The Steps', or else the A.A. program won't work.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hey just love your site.. Good old fashioned logic and reason. Most
crazy people dont know they are crazy .. do they??

<p>

Anyways.. in this quote you mentioned 100% recovery chance.. and at the
end you switch to chances are Very high..

<p>

Well a very high chance may be 90% but still isnt 100%. Even 99.99% isnt
100%

<p>

Proves one thing.. that your writing is slipping a little bit.

<p>

Its that hole in the dyke that lets in the water..

<p>

Absouloute black and white.. when it comes to abstinace from booze.. for
sure.

<p>

just one beer means Im not quit...maybe im not drunk but still not quit..

<p>

But few people who havent been beaten up bad enough will realy want to
quit. Perhaps that is the 0.1%.. the confused or the daydreamer  or the
stubborn.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Paul,
<p>
Nope, it's your logic that is broken. You are ignoring the time element, and
you are comparing <i>rates</i> to <i>odds</i>.
<p>
First, I was talking in the past tense, looking backwards in time from somewhere
in the future, recording someone's results,
saying that someone would have succeeded or not.
His success rate will then be 100% or zero, not 5%. He either quit drinking, or he didn't.
<p>
I know that isn't obvious, because I said that his <i>&quot;success rate will be&quot;</i>.
The key word there is <i>rate</i>. A rate is calculated as something per something else,
like miles per hour or miles per gallon, or sober successes per hundred incoming
patients. Such a success rate is calculated after the fact. When the
treatment program is done, or even better, a year after the program is done,
you ask, &quot;How many of them got and stayed sober?&quot;
With only one guy to count, the success rate has to be either zero or 100%.

<p>
Then I spoke in the future tense, speaking of the odds of someone succeeding in
the future.
Now you are talking about a probability, not a success rate.
And, if someone really wanted to quit drinking, then the odds of him succeeding
were very high.
<p>
But when you are trying to predict the future, the odds aren't 100%.
There are no absolute guarantees when you are making predictions.
<p>
(Like Yogi Bera said, &quot;Making predictions is really hard;
especially about the future.&quot;)
<p>
Have a good day.

They also condemned those people who were &quot;too cerebral for their own good.&quot;
Some of those condemned people died in Hitler's concentration camps.

The anti-intellectual tradition that you are promoting has a very bloody, sordid history.

<p>
Oh, and A.A. founders Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith learned all of that anti-intellectual
stuff from Frank Buchman while they were members of his Oxford Group cult.

</font>
<p>

Funny thing is, you probably don't even understand what I am saying.
You are not smart enough.  You are what we would call in the
intellectual circles at Princeton, a 'Grade B' thinker.  You have some
potential, but it's like you keep a poker face in your own head in order
to bluff yourself into thinking that you've got it all figured out.  But
you'll never grow with that brand of close-mindedness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are not saying anything. That's just
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem">a standard <i>ad hominem</i> attack</a>.
</font>
<p>

So I would just run circles around you, obvoiusly.  And no, I don't need
to reference fancy Latin terms.  I can just use my own power of reason,
something you don't possess yet.  You are stuck forcing logical
deductions out of concepts that don't exactly proceed into a valid
point. You lack the power of inductive reasoning.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Please give a working example of the inductive reasoning that you think I am failing
to see. Your rap is devoid of any actual facts or content.
</font>
<p>

Just keeping it real.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Obviously, you are not keeping it real. Do you have any <b>real facts</b> that you
would like to discuss, like the failure rate of Alcoholics Anonymous, or its suicide rate,
or the drop-out rate, or the cultish nature of the organization, or its tawdry history?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>

Hi Orange! It's me again.

<p>

Just thought you'd like to hear about my latest encounter with AA.
<p>
Well, this will be short:)
<p>
Ok I ran into 3 guys from &quot;the program&quot; at the local Tim Horton's coffee
shop today.

<p>

They approached me and asked me why I hadn't been to AA.
<p>
One guy was even looking at me with a look of pity on his face. Imagine
that!
<p>
Anyways, we started talking and the concept of &quot;live and let live&quot; came
up. They told me how wonderful life was in AA. They told me how good
their serenity was, etc.
<p>
I got the distinct impression that they were not only trying to &quot;sell&quot;
it to me, but that somehow in a sick and twisted way they were
validating themselves.
<p>
One guy finally said &quot;We go to AA so that we can live life on life's terms&quot;.
<p>
I said &quot;Really? Are you living life on life's terms or life on AA's terms?&quot;
<p>
They became all silent.
<p>
Then one guy spoke up nervously and said, &quot;Life on life's terms.&quot;
<p>
I asked him to prove it. To explain to me how AA could be a way of life
for him yet not live on it's terms.
<p>
Well, they left me at that point. Thank God!

<p>

Well Hope your having a nice day:)

<p>

Bye for now!

<p>

P.S. Still sober (5+years) No AA meetings. Go figure!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mvega,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. Thanks for the laugh.
<p>
And I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.

Subject:  	AA versus &quot;course in miracles&quot; thanks again for web site<br>

<p>

The &quot;Course In Miracles&quot; is hard to understand, and i do not totally
agree with everything in it.  However, on page  461 at the bottom of the
page, it indicates that the concept of &quot;powerlessness&quot; is an ultimate
cause for misery.  The concept,&quot;powerlessness' is a central component
with 12-steps and is probably 1 of the largest reasons for the
high-failure rates for AA and 12-step approaches.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Keneth,
<p>

Now that's an interesting observation.
<a href="orange-heresy.html#CIM">ACIM</a>
is loved by some Steppers,
as well as various other cult members. The subject of those books keeps
coming up, even just today,
<a href="orange-letters43.html#ACIM">here</a>.

<p>
But logically, you are quite right. Declaring yourself powerless is rolling
out the red carpet for misery.
<p>
Heck, I didn't beat alcohol and tobacco until I took just the
opposite attitude, and declared myself powerful, and said that
I could beat them, and would win the battle no matter what.
<p>
Have a good day.

Orange,

<p>
After stumbling upon your site I was left thinking we need more sites
like yours out there, not necessarily anti-aa but rather pro truth &#8212; I
like the way you make that distinction. I have the skills to build such
a site, and I am a writer by trade. I wondered how you would feel about
such an idea. I would need to borrow some of your work and thoughts, but
this site would be hosted in the UK. I think your work is amazing but I
might try and make a site that focuses on some of the key points and
then sends the viewers your way for a more detailed explanation. It will
take me about 2 weeks to build it &#8212; would you be happy to support me if
you were to approve of my work?

<p>
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. I am feeling
particularly passionate about this at the moment and the more I read,
the stronger that passion gets. Something has to be done &#8212; it must.

From:  	&quot;Laurie N.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Not just AA<br>

<p>

I just found your amazing website after doing exhaustive research on
chemical dependency, religion, legalities and ethics. I have been
working for a chemical dependency clinic for almost a year and couldn't
figure out why things felt so wrong. I was seeing things beyond belief,
things that if you don't actually see it, there is no way a person would
ever believe it. I felt like Alice in Wonderland with a stomach ache
everyday.
<p>
Then I read your Cult Test and was shocked. Point after point,
I was reliving examples of the environment I worked in everyday, not
only regarding staff but clients as well. &quot;Training sessions&quot; that
revolved around &quot;you have to trust us and respect us&quot;, telling my family
members and fellow staff that I am deceptive, not caring, in need of
psychotherapy. I had to stop hiding from my past and share my personal
life, because after all, their job was to keep me healthy and I couldn't
be healthy if I kept hiding, being recommended that certain members of
your family are not to be turned to for support (because they didn't
like them), a female client who was told she had to go to their church
every Sunday because she &quot;needs to come out of the darkness and let us
show you the light&quot;. And by the way, that was a condition of treatment.
<p>
I could go on and on and on and on and on, but I was finally fired last
week, apparently I never fit in. That confused me, because I received 2
promotions in the last 6 months and had a glowing review. Things got bad
for me when I began defending and not conforming.
<p>
In any case, I am still reeling, in shock and truly exhausted from what
the last 4 months has taken out of me.
<p>
I want to thank you however for the time, energy
and work you put into this site. I am looking at my situation and know
there is nothing I can do, but if enough people come to realize how
dangerous some of these organizations can be, especially in the hands of
complete whack jobs, maybe some kind of regulations can come into play.
<p>
In any case, thanks again for a great web site, I don't feel like Alice
quite so bad anymore!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Laurie,
<p>
Thanks for the story and all of the compliments.
<p>
And yes, I am also hoping that if enough people learn what is going on,
that maybe we can make things better.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Stephen B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	an ex-aa member's gratitude<br>

<p>

Hi my name is Steve, and I would like to thank you SO MUCH for the time
and effort you put into your research.  I did the aa cult thing for
about a year.  I knew something wasn't quite right about Alcoholics
Anonymous from the beginning. In fact I even remarked to my first
sponsor that I thought AA seemed cultish.  Yet I was told not to trust
myself and to trust AA.  Plus, lots of people in the general public know
about AA and it is regarded as a benign organization.  It is enjoying
years of propaganda, as you said.  Thus, I trusted myself even less in
regards to my initial response to AA, and I went along with the steps
and everything.  After wallowing in extreme guilt and having simple
slogans go through my head constantly for a year, I finally got fed up.
<p>
I'm not sure what finally broke the camel's back.  Maybe it was some  16
year old from sobriety high (those government-sponsored schools are
another research possibility)  telling me how to run my life and how to
work the steps properly. (I am 24, not that much older, but still...) Or
maybe it was seeing some kid who had grown up in foster care  his whole
life  getting bad-mouthed at group level by a &quot;spiritual&quot; old-timer for
not working the steps properly. He needed acceptance and social support,
certainly not cult religion.   Or maybe it was getting lots of money
taken from me by someone with &quot;quality&quot; sobriety (I think this is
actually called the 14th step, taking the newcomer's money,  but I might
be wrong.).  I don't remember exactly what finally did it, as there are
so many things I would like to forget that either happened to me or
people around me in those rooms.
<p>
Then, after a year, I did my research.  I must say that your website in
particular is what really set me free.  The abused mind of a cult member
needs to be provided with rational facts and lots of clear evidence.
<p>
Awesome job, Mr. Orange.  Humor has also helped me a great deal (thanks
to
<a href="orange-letters30.html#South_Park">South Park</a>
and that Visual Aids for the Sane website).
<p>
Anyways, this email is certainly overlooking a lot of things in my
experiences with the program, but again thank you.  I remember just
staring at your work for the first time for hours.  Oh yeah, I am still
sober and am actually feeling like my life is getting back on track
now.
<p>
However I do miss the social part of AA.  Yes, most people  in
there are not good people to be around, but there are also a lot of
good, though misguided,  people in there as well that just go to
meetings without really selling their souls to the steps.   There are
not that many SMART meetings in proximity to where I live. Is there any
chance that these alternatives will become more popular? Honestly, I am
wary of going to any self-help meetings at this point, but I am
interested in non-12 step groups.
<p>
I guess my worst problem these days is seeing active AA members on the
street.  Can you relate to this? I was exposed to a huge group of people
that I would really like to never see again, but they keep popping up
everywhere in the darndest places (outside of meetings, no less) and I
would like them to go away.  I also am worried about future career
opporunities being ruined by these people (though I don't plan on being
a psychologist as so many of these nitwits often become.  However, I'll
probably never be a construction worker either. Oh well.).  I don't
blame you for staying anonymous.
<p>
My last point is that I wish you would update your activism links and
suggestions more often.  I want to know how to do my part in exposing
these groups for what they are.  AA has created another enemy, I guess.
<p>
Anyways, stay sober, keep living life, and keep up the good work.
<p>
Probably my letter will get lost among the AA support letters, but
writing this was therapeutic. You've helped more people than you know.

<p>

IDEAS ARE BULLETPROOF

<p>

Steve (happily sober  ex aa'er)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
I'm glad to hear that you have escaped from the madhouse and
are feeling better.
<p>
About meeting the practicing true believers on the street, yes, I know what you mean. For the
first few years I would feel odd and awkward when I didn't play along with
their giddy assumptions that of course &quot;everybody&quot; is recovering through the Steps,
and isn't it wonderful?
<p>
Gradually, though, I began to feel differently....
<p>
<ul>
<li>
One of the things that really
did it was the realization that I had more sober time that most of the people
who were yammering about how well the Steps work.
<p>
<li>
And there was the funny thing
that I was the only one out of my class at the treatment center who had not relapsed.

<p>
<li>
And almost all of the sober people around here did it their own way, and the successful
people rarely believe in Steppism.

<p>
<li>
And now
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">my 12-Step counselor is in prison</a>
for snorting coke and screwing his step-children.
So much for 12-Step &quot;spiritual&quot; recovery.

<p><li>
It just became so obvious that I didn't need to apologize to anyone for not
buying into their nonsense.
<p>
In fact, they should feel awkward and stupid for still pushing the same losing proposition.
Like,
&quot;How can you continue to promote a program with a 100% failure rate? Are
you blind and crazy?&quot;
</ul>

<p>
About updating
<a href="orange-action.html">
the activist links</a>, ah yes. The big problem is thinking of new
activities &#8212; new things to do.
Updating the links is easy after I figure out what to do.
That's what's hard.
<p>


The number of SMART meetings is growing. Every month, a few more are added here and
there, although for sure we need lots more. In the mean time, you might find some
companionship in chatting online. Most of the non-cult self-help recovery groups have
online chats now.
<a href="orange-letters43.html#alt_list">Look here for a list</a>.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Date:  	Mon, April 10, 2006 11:17<br>
From:  	&quot;emerson&quot; <br>
Subject:  	A.A. And Bill Wilson<br>

<p>

Thank you for your very enlightening website. I had an alcohol and drug
problem for better than 25 years. After finding that I couldn't stop on
my own in my late 20's and being exposed and made aware of A.A. in a
rehab prior to that, I sought help for myself at a local church and
ended up at an A.A. club. I too was taken and touched by their manner of
dress, their demeanor and outlook on life, so I was determined to give
their program a try and picked up a 'white chip'.

<p>
I ran around for a year and a half doing the first three steps, i.e.
'the three step waltz' program and made a few half hearted attempts at
going through the steps both with a sponsor and through a Big Book
workshop. I finally left the fellowship of A.A. when some members tried
to heap me with the responsibilty of running a Sunday speakers meeting
that I was totally unprepared for. I had also seen some people who had
been around for sometime, still drinking.

<p>
After sucessfully staying clean and sober for six months without
meetings and having nothing to do with the A.A. fellowship, I started to
have a relapse. I was at some friends' house one Christmas when I
decided, at their urging, to have an inch of champagne at the bottom of
a rock glass, which I did and then got so frightened of drinking again
because I was so much of a drunken sot that I didn't dare risk drinking
again for fear of my life, I began using pot to 'stave the craving for a
drink off' and still be half way 'coherient'

<p>
This went on for another six months with more drug addicted behavior. I
was in a business proposition with a couple of other 'buddies' and was
trying to get a meeting together to solve some problems. I had set an
appropriate time and was waiting at our base of operations for the
meeting to happen and nobody showed. I was angry as I tried making phone
calls and waiting for the guys to arrive. Finally, I said &quot;Fuck it all&quot;
had some money in my pocket and brought a case of beer, put it in my
car, and decided to go to some other 'friends' house to share it with so
I didn't have to drink it all by myself.

<p>
We ended up going to the beach so we could polish it off and after
drinking almost a six pack, one right after another, I couldn't for the
life of me get drunk. I was already that way on my own emotions, that,
finally, I just stopped and let my friends have the rest. The next day,
I went back to A.A. in fear for my life, because there was no way that I
wanted to ever be drunk again because there was times that I should've
been killed in car accidents and walking on the railing of a bridge over
an inlet which was at least a 100 ft. drop at it's apex only to be saved
by the local police that told me to get down, which I did.

<p>
So I started to sit in the front at meetings, like it was suggested to,
and raised my hand to shared what had happened. When we were in the
closing prayer circle, I began to cry midway through. As the prayer
circle broke up, instead of welcoming me back to A.A. they just stood
around talking, congratulating each other, patting themselves on the
back, and discussing where they were going for coffee at except for one
elderly lady that came over to hug and console me. Come to find out
later that this woman just liked to chase young men around A.A. and
while it was a nice gesture it was something I didn't really need at the
time.

<p>
Anyway I began to open up about things to other A.A. members and
eventually was steered to a Big Book workshop where they take you
through the steps as described out of the Big Book, at this point I was
willing to try anything. The men that led the meeting had at least 50
years of sobriety and experience between them, and were well known and
in good standing with the local fellowship. So I brought a Big Book and
a highlighter and started highlighting passages in the book that I
related to. At the workshop these men talked about being */_recovered_/*
from alcoholism as opposed to recovering and of not solving just one
of our problems but */_all_/* our problems

<p>

One morning I woke up crying for all the things I had done in my disease
and the idea came in my head to pray, which I did, because I had nothing
else to lose. So I got on my knees, opened up the Big Book to the page
in Bill's Story where it had a form of the 3rd step prayer and the 7th
and 8th step there too. It was then that an amazing thing happened, when
I said the prayer for myself, I'd immediately stopped crying and I felt a
great weight being lifted off of my shoulders, I know it sounds cliched,
but that's exactly what happened!!!

<p>

Getting these kind of results, I saw no reason to stop what I was doing,
so I kept going to the workshop. After a few weeks of reading, praying,
making out the resentment list, doing a 5th step and praying some more, I
began to set out making amends. When I got a quarter of the way through
the 9th step, I saw this woman in the fellowship that I knew whom I
thought was a total 'queen bitch' sharing at a meeting about going
through a particularly rough time of things, but she was coping.
There was a part of the Big Book that said, &quot;We went to our former
enemies, and expressed our ill feelings toward them.&quot;

<p>
So I made it a point to get with her after the meeting to do so. I had
talked to her, asked her to forgive me, hugged her, and walked away.
About 20 seconds later, I was outside on the patio of the A.A. club I
was at, when I suddenly felt a wet spot in my belly, and just as
suddenly, this wet spot just shot down through my legs to the bottom of
my feet and shot up through my whole body like a geyser and all the fear
that had permeated through my body was replaced with just pure and utter
Love.

<p>
It was something I'd never felt before in my life. I was so awed and
dumbfounded, I just gracefully fell into a chair where I sat basking in
the experience for I don't know how long, maybe 20 minutes to an hour.
Finally I got up, wondering if it was safe to drive home, being the way
I was, but I did and went to bed for a nap. When I got up, I was
plesently suprised to find the beatific feeling still with me. The
members in A.A. call what I had a 'White light experience&quot; I recently
found out that what I had was a Kundalini experience. While in the
throes of this, linear time had just stopped for me. I began to exibit
no fear whatsoever, people leading meetings was asking for somebody to
read How It Works, I just walked by, casually grabbed the sheet it was
written on out of the guy's hand and took a seat in front, reading it
with an authority that I had never had before when it was time to read.

<p>
When people began to share, I found out that I had developed an empathy
for them. I could hear and feel their joy, bliss and suffering due to
powerlessness. There were also some people, one in particular who had
been around for many years and 'well respected' just mouthing words. It
was then I learned who had did what in their recovery in A.A. I also
began talk to the fellowship when I was sharing, like 3rd class witch
doctors, which was something I rather enjoyed.

<p>
As time went on, I began to get the notion that there was more to the
'God Thing' than what was being talked about in A.A. I began to be a
'magnet' for spiritual things, like a button with a duck on it that said
&quot;I don't know where I'm going, but I know that I'm on my way&quot; and a
newspaper article about people that had gone through near death
experiences, feeling the same overwhelming feeling of love, peace and
protection that I was going through at the time. The Big Book became an
obsolete thing for me. I found out through many years of spiritual study
on the internet what I was going through was valid and natural,
even though the fellowship would say otherwise.

<p>
My sex drive hightened as well and that too was perfectly natural, and I
got laid a lot just by sharing positively and with authority at
meetings, while most others exploited their sponsorees to do that, both
men and women. I need to say here that I was single at the time and did
no wrong and all the women approached me rather than I to them. Then
there came a day when I found out about the darker side of A.A. One day
one of the men that led the Big Book workshop was at a meeting and
started to share about the Big Book and recovery, when this one guy from
Boston got up and said that he was &quot;full of shit&quot; and proceeded to tell
him why. The argument even started up outside after the meeting with the
Bostonian practically getting in the guy's face while my friend from the
workshop,  just stood there calm and as peaceful as Jesus addressing the
Devil.

<p>
Then this 'gentleman' from Boston who was also well known around the
fellowship started taking on sponsorees, both men and women, for the
purpose of getting the Big Book workshop out. A few months later, I
began hearing stories from women about this guy soliciting sex from
them, saying that he would take them through the steps if they would
sleep with this scumbag, and when they refused, he would have one of his
male sponsorees call up the women and threatened them with death if they
ever said anything.

<p>
Unfortunately he succeeded in getting the original workshop out, which
had a great sucess rate and no problems, with his that has questionable
ethics and scandal. As for me, I've since left the fellowship of A.A. to
get happy and to pursue my spirituality with fervor. I've been clean and
sober ever since.

<p>
What I've since learned is that bad people can have a certain
spirituality too. It is unfortunate, but it's a fact. As far as I'm
concerned the steps are the greatest gift from God to His children in
the 20th Centrury and that He wants us to have the great care and
concern and compassion that He does. This is eveidenced by people like
Helen Schuman that 'wrote'
<a href="orange-heresy.html#ACIM"><i>A Course In Miracales</i></a>
in the 70's, Leo
Buscalia, Marianne Willamson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and even Plato, it's
just that we (mankind) as a whole are hard learners, but nevertheless,
there is a spiritual movement taking place and even A.A. or any other 12
step fellowship can stop it. No matter how much negativity they feed the
newcomer or how much they chose to stick their collective heads in the
sand ignoring it, and somewhere down the road, maybe not in this
lifetime, but somewhere the 12 step fellowships will be offered a
choice, either start changing their minds about some things or be cut
from the branch!!!

<p>
Now about Bill and the Big Book, what the Big Book actually is, is Bill
Willson's story rehashed. Every last bit of the first 164 pages is from
his own experiences. While he may have cheated on Lois, it was a very
right and wise thing to do in not telling her and that he did the right
thing by telling the truth about his infedelity in a roundabout way in
The Big Book, because the need for confession is imparitive in
recovery. it's just a shame that things are going on like they are. Maybe
one day that will change.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Emerson,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety.
It is good that you decided to quit drinking, and then did it.

<p>
I especially want to thank you for such a clear description of the
indoctrination and conversion of
a newcomer into a true believer. It's neat how accurately you catalogued
the breakdown of your mind, step by step, as they worked the program on you.

<p>
And it's great that you finally saw through it and decided to move on.
Good luck in your future endeavors.

<p>
It's funny that you should mention
<a href="orange-heresy.html#ACIM"><i>A Course In Miracles</i></a>.
That darned thing just keeps
<a href="orange-letters43.html#ACIM">popping up again and again</a>,
three times now in just the last few days.
Apparently that hoax is becoming increasingly popular in A.A. circles.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
And have a good life.

<p>
Hi Agent Orange!

<p>
I am very intrigued by your writings on AA.  I have
only been in AA 3 months.  Took me 3 months to get my one month chip.
AA has been a real eye opener for me.  I left 3 meetings frustrated by
some sponsor and drank some.  A bit of humor, yet traumatic too, to know
that as people sit in AA meetings, some are planning to go have a drink
right afterwards because AA is upsetting to them.  I have found it can
be dangerous to very new and vulnerable people.  Some people are quite
nice, but most of the time I feel like I am sitting in the twilight
zone.  Anyway, Like to read your website.

<p>
My name is Cindy Y.  And I don't care if an AA member reads this
with my name attached.  I do have freedom of speech.  Some people have
gone out of their way to lie, and try to make me uncomfortable.  Maybe I
will continue to go and make them uncomfortable. I stood up for myself
when my sponsor outright lied about me using AA to pick up men.  I don't
need AA to pick up a man.  That's not where I am at in life right now
anyway though. So, I confronted her in front of her friends and now I
get the cold stare from some people.  I was very honest and diplomatic
with her.  Funny, how can she sponsor when she was and is being
investigated for molesting her son?

<p>
Anyway, I will keep in touch.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Cindy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I hope you are doing well.
And thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
When I hear that someone is working their way through their first few months
of sobriety, I always want to start dispensing advice.
I don't know if I really have any pearls of wisdom that will help you, but
I have to recommend the web page on
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">the Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
Understanding that little monster has been a big help to me, for staying off
of both alcohol and tobacco.
<p>
And I put together a list of discussions of what works, earlier,
that you might want to look at,
and

Have a good day and a good life.

From:  	&quot;Russ L.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Bill's broads<br>

<p>

This is a very well-researched and very interesting piece on Bill
Wilson's habits with women other than his wife.  It is pretty well known
to anyone who has done any reading or research on the subject that Bill
ran free and loose when it came to women.  To this, I say, &quot;so what?&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Russ,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
So what?<br>
Well, I've heard a lot of A.A. true believers insisting that Bill
Wilson was some kind of holy man who was
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot030.html#Bill_guided">guided by God&quot; to write the 12 Steps</a>
and
the <i>Big Book</i>. But I know that real spiritual people don't act like Bill Wilson
did: cheating on his wife, exploiting sick alcoholic women for his personal pleasure,
cheating his business partner Henry Parkhurst out of 
all of the money, lying constantly, grandly bragging constantly, making himself the
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Poohbah">Grand Poohbah of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>&quot;,
and putting on airs of being spiritual,
attacking those who criticized him or disagreed with him,
and worst of all,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">lying about his success rate</a>
and telling alcoholics that he had a sure-fire, never-fails cure for alcoholism.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
And I know that the teachings of such a phony aren't worth following.
</font>
<p>

Are you an alcoholic?  Has your life been saved by the program and
fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous?  Well, I am and mine has.  So I
could nearly forgive Bill if he were an axe murderer, as long as his
legacy was the program of AA.  While he is credited as the &quot;co-founder&quot;
of the program along with Dr. Bob Smith, it is really the efforts of
Bill Wilson that gave us the program we have today.  He wrote the Big
Book.  He wrote <i>12 Steps and 12 Traditions</i>.  He is the one who
synthesized the 12 steps from the Oxford Group program.  He is the one
who realized and put into motion the guiding principal that, in order to
keep sobriety, we must give it away.  In other words, the only way an
alcoholic ultimately stays sober is by sharing with another alcoholic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<ol>
<li>
Yes, I am an alcoholic, if by the word &quot;alcoholic&quot; you mean someone who is
hypersensitive to alcohol and simply cannot drink any more of it or it will
kill him.

for a larger discussion of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;.

<li> You are assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists.
Alcoholics Anonymous didn't make you quit drinking or save your life.
You did. You decided not to die by alcohol.
<li>
The <i>Big Book</i> and <i>12 Steps and 12 Traditions</i> are some of the worst
garbage ever written in the English language, not holy scriptures that help alcoholics.
<li>
The Twelve Steps are also cult religion garbage
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">that Bill Wilson copied</a> from
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups</a>.
<li>
There is no &quot;guiding principle&quot; in doing recruiting for a cult religion.
Ask any ex-Moonie or ex-Scientologist.
</ol>
</font>


<p>
<a name="not_saints"> </a>
To the best of my knowledge, no one has ever nominated Bill for
sainthood, or to be a bishop, for that matter.  In fact, he writes on
page 60 of <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, &quot;...we are not saints.&quot;  Give the man
his due.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, Bill Wilson talked out of both sides of his mouth, constantly. It was his bait-and-switch
game.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We aren't saints... We know only a little.&quot;

And then it's

His work, along with those who followed him, has saved
countless thousands, if not millions, from the fatal disease of
alcoholism.  It is no coincidence that the vast majority of commercial
treatment programs rely on the 12-step program, as well as all the other
offshoots, such as NA, CA, GA, OA, ad infinitum.
<p>

Russ L.


<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but A.A. has a zero percent success rate above the normal rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholism.
<p>
A.A. hasn't saved millions of alcoholics or even hundreds of thousands.
Alcoholics who don't get the A.A. &quot;help&quot; recover at the same rate,
or even at better rates, than the alcoholics who go to Alcoholics Anonymous.
And the "do-it-yourself" people don't die as much, or commit suicide as much
as the A.A. group does.
<p>

Even a leader of A.A. says so.
<p>
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant, who is a member of the Board of Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous [World] Services, Inc., tried for nearly 20 years to
prove that A.A. worked. In the end he had to report that A.A. had no good
effect on alcoholics at all. Groups of Alcoholics who even got 8 years of
A.A. didn't sober up any more than other groups of alcoholics who got no
&quot;help&quot; at all.
<p>
And Vaillant reported that A.A. had an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate &#8212; the worst
death rate of any kind of treatment that he studied.
See the whole story
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">here</a>.
<p>
And yes, I am aware of the fact that the 12-Step cult, including
Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Narcotics Anonymous, et. al., has successfully
invaded the treatment industry and made it a failure and a national tragedy.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	human_race<br>
Subject:  	Wowwww the penny just dropped<br>

<p>

I just had an exciting moment in the shower.

<p>
Well I thought of a guy I sponsored (harrassed, confronted and nurtured
= he needed it) in AA a few years ago and he kind of crossed my mind.

<p>
And the AA line to get sober of &quot;God could and would if he was
sought..... would make? you get sober.

<p>
e.g.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Our description of the alcoholic, the chapter to the
agnostic, and our personal adventures before and after
make clear three pertinent ideas:

<p>
(a)  That we were alcoholic and could not manage
our own lives.

<p>
(b)  That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism.

<p>
(c)  That God could and would if He were sought.<br>
</font>

<font size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, page 60.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Well I was thinking that there was a fucking shit load of people
standing on the beaches a while back and as the sea surged in to drown
them... all cried &quot;God save me, save me, Oh God... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot;

<p>
And God didn't and wouldn't when he was sought.**

<p>
Thousands of people come into AA get fed this shit and they fuck up all
over the place; AA has a failure rate much higher than people who get
sober all by themselves.

<p>
And I thought.. Yeah... that's just the thing to bring up when they try
to brain wash you with that shit if you ever find yourself in an AA meeting.

<p>
** and he doesn't put in much of a fucking appearance when he is needed
in lots of other places either.. except for cunts like George Bush (who
lives in a magical fairy land.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Human,
<p>
I pretty much agree with you. The only comment that I have is that I am not
angry with God about how things are going, for the simple reason that I don't
believe in a God who meddles and micro-manages this world. I think God is kind
of busy with keeping the Law of Gravity working, and keeping the electrons orbitting
the nuclei of atoms, and keeping nuclear reactions working right, so that the stars
keep on burning bright.
<p>
God doesn't seem to care a whole lot about whether the worms or the
hairless monkees down here engage in reproductive activities.
<p>
On the bright side, we are not just left out in the cold and dark, all alone.
I think that our awareness is our connection to the divine. I believe that when we
die, we wake up into a cosmic community of awareness, and find ourselves coming home.
<p>
But in the mean time, I see no evidence that God cheats at solitaire, and rigs the
football games down here.
<p>
So the whole A.A. program is fatally flawed where it assumes that we can just demand
that God fix our alcoholism for us.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hey Orange,

Why do you call yourself SECRET Agent Orange?

How did you originally get off of alcohol?

Steve

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steve.
<p>
1. Because I'm anonymous &#8212; really anonymous.
<p>
And actually, it's also a bit of a joke.
It started with a joke about mixing apples and oranges, described
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Agent_Orange">here</a>.
And then it sort of grew.

There is Secret Agent Orange, and Secret Agent Apple, and Secret Agent Banana.
Secret Agent Banana tells me that he does his best work in the dark.

<p>
2. I just quit. I just got sick and tired of being sick and tired.
And my life fell apart, and everything went wrong, and I got evicted and
was homeless, and then a doctor told me to quit drinking or I was going to
die. That was the last straw. I decided that I had simply totally had it
with suffering like that, and didn't want to die that way, so I just quit.

From:  	&quot;Peter M.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Religious Roots of AA<br>

<p>

Hi A. Orange,

<p>

I have just been reading your critique of the Oxford Group and AA. I am
currently a member of AA &#8212; been going three or so years.

<p>

I have voiced the same kind of criticisms as your article to other
members of the &quot;fellowship&quot;. One or two agree with me.

<p>

I am actually a Christian first. I was seaching and reading The Bible
just before coming into AA. I came into AA after the proverbial &#8212; and a
somewhat spectular (grandiosity?) &#8212; rock bottom. I'm having trouble
reconciling AA with Christianity for all the reasons you outline. It's
nice to know I'm not alone in this world.

<p>
<a name="suicide"> </a>
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
One guy here in London is so out of control (the cult master) that he
&quot;suggested&quot; one of his sponsees stop taking his perscribed medication.
Two weeks later said sponsee had comitted suicide by jumping off a
motorway bridge.

<p>

These people would do less harm to themselves and to others if they
continued drinking. The best (only) solution is to find Jesus. What do
you feel about Christianity?
<p>
There are many denominations. I currently attend an evangelical church
but enjoy the odd Catholic mass.

<p>

Hope I'm not freaking you out too much here.

<p>

Cheers,<br>
Peter.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Peter,
<p>
You aren't freaking me out at all. I like Christianity, especially as Christ
taught in the Sermon on the Mount. I don't belong to any particular sect, and in
fact am very ecumenical. I have studied and learned from all of the great religions
of the world, so I don't limit myself to any one thing. I'll take wisdom wherever
I can find it.
<p>

You are quite right about whatever religion is practiced in A.A., it doesn't much
resemble Christianity.
<p>
It takes world-class arrogance for an untrained, undegreed
A.A. sponsor to tell a sponsee not to take the medicine that a doctor gave him,
but I have heard that story in connection to A.A.
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications">again</a>
and
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#no_meds">again</a>
and
<a href="orange-coffee.html">again</a>.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE, 2013.01.20: There is now a whole file of such A.A. &quot;no meds&quot; stories,
<a href="orange-no_meds.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
<p>
Bill Wilson loved to rave about &quot;humility&quot;, but I don't see very much genuine
humility in A.A. as it is actually practiced. A little real humility might save
a few lives &#8212; humility like the realization that a sponsor doesn't know much about
being a doctor.
<p>
And it wouldn't hurt if the A.A. people who are meeting in church basements would
really listen to the preacher upstairs now and then, and ignore the nutty sponsors.
<p>
But they don't and they won't and that's why A.A. is more of a cult than a self-help
group.

<p>
Such dogmatic adherence to the anti-medications prejudice
even happened to my buddy in a treatment program.
That is, 5 years ago, I voluntarily went into a treatment program, just in case they could
teach me anything that might help me to stay off of alcohol.
I made friends with another older guy there.
When he said, &quot;You know, we are just getting to be too old for this stuff any more&quot;,
we connected right there, because that was exactly how I felt.
<p>
And wouldn't you know it? His very first sponsor in <i>Dual Recovery Anonymous</i>,
and the other old-timers in the group too, immediately told him to stop taking his medications.
<p>
That guy had already told me that his meds were the only thing that kept him
from relapsing. 
With his Paxil, he was okay. Without it, he flipped out every time, and ended up
drinking and drugging. But his sponsor
didn't even bother to ask about that before they just dogmatically declared that he should
stop taking his medications.
<p>
The sponsor is a fool. Such people have no qualifications to be handing out medical instructions.
<p>

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

the American one. Nothing has really changed at all. Given this, we can
only try and make ourselves and others happy by doing the right thing
for ourselves and for our neighbors in Christ Jesus. It is everything.

Sound familiar ? Holy cow, ripped off hook, line and sinker. Rebadged
and reissued as AA. I guess Christianity has constantly been reissued by
heretics throughout the ages. At least the Oxford Group kept Jesus
Christ and The Bible in there!!! Holy hell Orange. Where's the napalm ?

And you know, the kicker is that the Oxford Group was not really
Christianity. Oh they claimed that it was, but there was no
connection to Christianity other than the fact that they
engaged in name-dropping, and mentioning Jesus and some
saints now and then.

But Frank Buchman's teachings were really heretical, and some

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Probably why Time Magazine had the Oxford Group leader on the cover as a
cultist. When is someone going to have the balls to do this with Bill
Wilson and Robert Smith and the cult that is AA ? (I know you have made
a good start online ...)
<p>
The Oxford Group changed its name prior to WWII to Moral Re-Armament and
believed that divine guidance would prevent WWII from breaking out. The
name was changed also because of dwindling attendance as a result of
cultlike beliefs, whereas Frank Buchman was on the cover of Time
magazine with the title &quot;Cultist Buchman&quot;.

From:  	&quot;Howard W.&quot;

<p>
Dear Orange:

<p>
I am sorry to keep e mailing you  &#8212; but, you are unique.  No need to
publish this.

<p>
I am in the process of deciding that AA is a troubled organism.  I am coming
to think that AA is quite vulnerable and &quot;needy&quot;.  I think that AA has a
patholical need for validation; AA needs to be needed.  AA seems to need
people to tell AA that it is essential and valuable.  It seems to feed on
need.  Perhaps AA is clinically depressed.  A strange notion, perhaps:  AA
is clinically depressed.

<p>
This does trouble me; I have come to think that AA is a deeply troubled
organization.  In a sense, that may be worse than it being a cult.

<p>
Actually, when I went to AA, I appreciated the coerced attendees.  Many
seemed to understand why they were there:  to stay out of jail; and, to fill
the rooms.  They were, I am sure, quite cynical.  But, not far off the mark.
These notions are not in conflict, imho.

<p>
Many coerced attendees are not problem drinkers.

<p>
I am, in fact, very deeply troubled by the substance abuse treatment system.
I regard, in all seriousness, 12 step as iatrogenic.  It causes disease;
not cure it.  It reminds me of leeches.

<p>
I have a real difficulty with a profession which allows this modality to
exist.

<p>
Regards<br>
HW

Hi Orange.
<p>
Just love browsing through your website.  I get so much
pleasure and amusement---.
<p>
Answer me this one.  What do you call a
bunch of folks who 1st &#8212; Say the  Serenity Prayer, calling on the name
of God, asking for His help, guidance etc., etc., then spend the rest of
an hour cursing Him, using his name in vain, and other mean,
disrespectful (to God and other meeting attendees) names that would make
a gutter-bum blush, then at the end of this Pray the Lords Prayer, again
evoking Him and His name to ask Him to intervene in their lives after
giving Him the dickens and raising HELL with Him for 60 minutes?
<p>
You tell me!

You are quite right. There is something very odd about the &quot;love&quot; where people

Subject:  	Letters<br>

<p>

Hi Orange,

<p>

Have written to you several times before, but to no avail.  Just really
wanted to say a big &quot;thank you&quot; for helping me find my way out of NA, AA
etc whilst I was still young.

<p>

I have since done my best to discount the cults in whatever way possible
since leaving, including writing to the English drug worker &quot;trade
press&quot; (I am employed in one of the &quot;front line&quot; drug agencies),
commenting on a 12 step group that works in Prisons (RAPt &#8212;
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731163044/http://www.rapt.org.uk/">
http://www.rapt.org.uk</a>).
<p>
They claim to have
a 50% success rate, which is backed up by government funded research.  I
have written on more than one occasion asking to see the research, and
have always been ignored, so I decided to call them on their lies in a
more public forum.  You can read the rather angry responses that I got
at<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731163044/http://www.drinkanddrugs.net/features/april1006/letters.pdf">
http://www.drinkanddrugs.net/features/april1006/letters.pdf</a><br>

(second
page, as well as someone slating harm min techniques in favour of 12
step on the 3rd page).  I am currently drafting my response, and
information from your site has been invaluable in debunking some of the
&quot;12 step works&quot; claims that were made.

<p>

I have also set up a MySpace group called &quot;Recovering Without AA&quot;, the
URL of which is<br>

I would
appreciate a quick plug, so would be grateful if you do print this
letter.  We link directly to your pages?

Good luck with your continued efforts.  I noticed in a recent letter you

with interest.

From:  	&quot;david r.&quot;

<p>

thanks for your articles on aa. i am a registered nurse with a drinking
problem. i made the mistake of getting&quot;treatment&quot;. it is the biggest joke
and fraud ever perpetuated on the insurance industry (besides home
health care).
<p>
while the physical detoxification saved my life, the ensuing
treatment program was repugnant! i felt guilty knowing that blue
cross/blue shield was paying for me to paint little boxes, play
pictionary and the like. and the facility bills insurance 35 dollars a
meal! and a typical meal was ... a... hamburger... and a slice of pickle. or
... a.... hotdog.... and by this i mean 1 hamburger, no dressings, just 2
pieces of bread, a patty and a piece of cheese. no side dishes! this
after having a dietician preach healthy eating to us. and a hotdog was a
piece of bread and a weiner. that was it! for 35 dollars! (they were
teaching us the rewards of delayed gratification i suppose, as all people
with drinking problems ascribe to their king baby philosophy) and i had
to sit through the nauseating aa meetings.
<p>

dont get me wrong. i am as
religious as they come. in fact the therapists actually derided me
because i did not curse, and i did not rub all over and flirt with the
women (i am engaged, so why go pawing on all the women?) and as to the
meetings they were a joke. say the bland empty steps, then have a few
drunks tell how awful their life is and tell all their problems, then
say the lords prayer, then keep coming back... and noone has solutions.
only problems. then they say &quot;dont you feel better now that we had the
meeting?
<p>

while it may sound funny to you i feel that aa is devoid of true
spirituality. if you think a doorknob is a power greater than you, you
must have a very low opinion of yourself.
<p>

all the while i was in the
meetings i asked god to forgive me for being there but i was doing what
i needed to do to save my job. all the while i felt &quot;there is just
something wrong with this picture&quot; so you dont have to be an agnostic or
atheist to disagree with aa. i am a baptist, and i think aa and popular
alcoholism treatment are a joke. i am convinced that alcoholism is a
disease. but drunkenness is a sin. alcoholism is a disease in that we lack
the proper metabolic enzymes to metabolize alcohol in the way it should
be. it is sinful in that knowing this we choose to drink
anyway. alcoholism is a disease,but drunkenness is a choice.
<p>

thanks again for your article.
<p>

regards.
david

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi David,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
I hope you are feeling better now.
<p>
And thanks for the report on another treatment program.
Indeed, what a hoax.
<p>
And about, &quot;aa is devoid of true spirituality&quot;.
Yeh, I have to agree. I was just thinking the same thing today.
It occurred to me that a lot of A.A. members are so confused about what
spirituality is that they are actually repulsed, and run away, when they
are confronted with real spirituality.

<p>
You know, a lot of good people would really have a hissy fit if they knew what was
going on in the recovery industry, but they don't.
And they don't believe it when somebody tells them,
because the truth is just so outrageous that they find it unbelievable.
<p>
Oh well, we have to just keep plugging away at getting the truth out.
<p>
Have good day and a good life.
