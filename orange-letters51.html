&quot;Internet Addiction&quot;?

<p>

Behavior: It's Addictive
<p>
I'm tempted to write that I found this story about &quot;Internet Addiction&quot;
(

after many hours of aimless surfing the net, but actually I just got back
from dinner with two friends and checked the headlines on CNN.com. Yeah,
right!
<p>
another <i>Internet-Addict-In-Denial-Lie</i>! And anyone who believes it is  an
<i>Internet-Addict-Enabler</i>! As &quot;expert&quot; Dr. Diane M. Wieland points out,
<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Denial is strong in Internet addicts who claim they cannot be  addicted
to a
machine,&quot; Wieland notes. The &quot;one more minute&quot; response to being  asked to
go offline is common and is similar to an alcoholic who says they  will
quit
drinking after &quot;one more drink.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>
Why can't we just say that some people might be happier if they were to
allocate their time differently (more time on sports, or less time on
sports,
card playing, TV watching, eating, etc., etc.)? What's  the point of
calling it
an &quot;addiction&quot; when people develop habits they'd like to  break?

Hi Andrew,
<p>
Thanks for the note. That is both amusing and true. It seems to really depend on
your definition of &quot;addiction&quot;. I know it sure isn't an addiction like alcohol or heroin
or nicotine.
It may be obsessive or compulsive behavior, but as the writer pointed out, there
is a lot of that going around. Just ask any golf widow.

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;william n.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Thanks for the Help<br>

<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>
I just celebrated a year on May 26th. I was sober for
9 years before that, but started to drink again. I
drank again because I was bored and bummed out about
life, to tell you the truth. I got in a mess of
trouble (again) and lost my license for a while, and
so here I am behind the 8-ball again with fines,
surcharges, etc. But I've got my sobriety and I'm
enjoying it immensely.

<p>

Anyway, I did the AA thing for a long time &#8212; too long.
When I first started out in AA 13 years ago, I thought
right away it was a weird group with weird people in
it. But as you have beautifully pointed out time and
again, I was foisted into it by the criminal justice
system. So I had to attend or else I went to State
Prison. So there I was: I had to listen to these guys.

<p>

I was very dazed and confused at that time, and
therefore in a horrendously vulnerable position. And
here were these knuckleheads telling me how I was
willful, and how my thinking was terrible, and how I
wasn't right with God (as if they knew). Well, it did
a number on me so I followed along, dumbly.

<p>
<a name="halfway"> </a>
I then got thrust into a halfway house for 14 months,
where the brow beating continued. The halfway house
was, as you might expect, a farm league for the
12-step program. We used to sit in weekly marathon
Friday night group sessions, confessing all kinds of
inappropriate and extremely personal information about
each other. And then it was expected that we were
supposed to feel &quot;better&quot; and &quot;lighter.&quot; Well, I never
did &#8212; I felt terrible. I couldn't stand that
confessing stuff. It never was cathartic for me. It
just depressed the hell out of me to tell you the
truth.

<p>

After I got out of the halfway house I still went to
meetings for a while. But then I tailed off. I heard
all the doom and gloom pronouncements from the AA
crowd, that I was &quot;out there,&quot; that I was in trouble,
etc. Frankly, life was fine. I was just busy having a
life, doing things that were meaningful and enjoyable
to me.

<p>

Anyway, when I relapsed 2 year ago I went back to AA,
as I didn't know any better (but suspected it.) I used
my grand sponsor as my sponsor and to his credit he
spent a lot of time with me. He drove me around,
helped me do errands, etc. He was very selfless with
his time. But the constant, mindless dogma that came
from his mouth, coupled with his criticism and the
emptiness and frustration I felt from the people and
the meetings forced me to look elsewhere to continue
my sobriety. By the way, for the record I stopped
drinking first, and THEN went back to AA.

<p>
<a name="bad_sponsor"> </a>
One night my sponsor called saying he hadn't &quot;seen me
around&quot; lately. That's program-speak for, &quot;You're not
going to meetings.&quot; I opened up and tried to explain
to him my doubts, fears, and concerns about what I was
seeing in the people and in the program, and he just
said as if programmed, &quot;So &#8212; you're taking your will
back.&quot;

<p>
That cinched it for me. I thought to myself, &quot;You
fucking asshole &#8212; I'm trying to connect to you, trying
to tell you what's on my mind, what worries me, but
the banal platitudes of AA carried more weight and
veracity than my pouring my heart out. That was the end
for me.

<p>
I started citing the facts about AA to him, the
Vaillant study, the AA triennial studies, etc., and he
just couldn't handle it. He kept sneering, &quot;So, you're
gonna do it you're way, huh?&quot; I said yes, I was. Then
I asked him a poignant question. I said, &quot;You DO wish
me well, right? I CAN count on you for support,
right?&quot; And you know what? He had trouble answering
that. What a sad thing. Had I been the sponsor, I
would be happy for anyone who was trying to get sober,
by whatever means. But my sponsor was more loyal to
AA, and its code of conduct than he was to me. I never
heard from him after that night. Never called me to
see how I was doing &#8212; nothing. So if you're in AA and
you're reading this, please ask yourself if this is
really the sobriety and spirituality you want to have.
Are these the kind of people you want directing your
life?

<p>
My advice to newcomers is use the 10-foot-pole rule
when it comes to AA. Stay clear because you can do
better. But if you're forced into it because of the
courts, then my suggestion is watch-out out there,
because you are in a very vulnerable position. If you
get one of these true-believers as a sponsor, be very
careful.

<p>
The problem is the program has built-in mechanisms
that ensure it never gets any better. And it
immediately squashes any individual questions or
doubts it members might have, dismissing them as
&quot;stinking thinking,&quot; or &quot;willfulness.&quot; What a load of
horseshit, honest to God.

<p>
The people who give you &quot;advice&quot; are the same people
who have sat like lumps in church basements day after
day and sometimes even year after year. How they think
they have become enlightened and spiritual during this
mostly passive process is absolutely beyond me. All
they do is sit and repeat the same clich&eacute;s over and
over to each other, for the same problems over and
over, and yet somehow this substitutes for wisdom. It
just doesn't add up if you honestly look at it.

<p>
Anyway Orange I got so pissed after that last
discussion with my sponsor that I wrote an op-ed piece
to the biggest daily newspaper in my state, &quot;The Star
Ledger.&quot; They haven't published it and I kind of doubt
they will. After all, I'm not a famous writer or doper
or celebrity. But I'm including it (below) because I
think you will appreciate it.

<p>
Thanks for letting me get this off. Keep up the great
work. Here's my op-ed thing:

<p>
<center>
<table width="97%" border="5" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

Name:                 William N.<br>
Address:        Annandale NJ <br>

<p>

Op-Ed Article

<p>

I'm responding to the recent article in the Ledger
recently where addiction workers are appealing to the
Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse to
restore funding, and also to the letters criticizing
Stanton Peele's objection that New Jersey had paid
$1.6 million over the past two years for unused beds
in private treatment facilities.

<p>

One of the biggest problems with the 12-step (AA)
program and the attendant addiction industry is the
inability for its proponents to tolerate any criticism
towards it. This is unfortunate, as most treatment for
alcohol and drug addiction provided in the State of
New Jersey (+90%) is based upon the 12-step approach,
an approach with which I am familiar. Often, all these
treatment centers do (with all the money they get) is
simply teach its residents about the 12-step program.
Fortunately I was lucky enough to attend a facility
which had its own code of conduct and behavior above
and beyond the 12-step program.

<p>

What many people don't know and what is assiduously
ignored by the 12-step programs and the treatment
industry that promulgates it, is that the 12-step
"solution" to alcoholism and drug addiction has a
virtually zero success rate. This has been reported in
several studies. The most telling is in an eight year
study of 100 alcoholics performed by Harvard professor
George E. Vaillant, who is a non-alcoholic &quot;Class A&quot;
member of the Alcoholics Anonymous World Services,
Inc. (AAWS) Board of Trustees and a diehard supporter
of AA. Among other findings, Vaillant's study produced
two startling results:

<p>

1) Five non-treated alcoholics (the &quot;control group&quot;)
were sober after 8 years. Vaillant called this
&quot;spontaneous remission,&quot; or &quot;the natural history of
the disease,&quot; and

<p>

2) Five AA-treated alcoholics were still sober after 8
years.

<p>

According to the study, the 12-step AA approach was no
better than doing nothing. In addition, the AA treated
group experienced the highest percentage of
alcohol-related deaths: 29 out of 100. This is more
than any other treatment, including non-treatment. So
not only is AA's failure rate 95%, it's more lethal
than anything else as well.

<p>

Vaillant (who considered the death rate &quot;appalling&quot;)
reported, &quot;After initial discharge, only five patients
in the Clinic sample never relapsed to alcoholic
drinking, and there is compelling evidence that the
results of our (AA) treatment were no better than the
natural history of the disease.&quot; There is also
evidence that the
12-step doctrine of powerlessness leads to binge
drinking. Other studies (Brandsma et. al.) have found
that 12-step participants were binge drinking five
times as much as alcoholics who received no treatment.
Incidentally, the 12-step program teaches its
followers that relapsers either didn't &quot;really try,&quot;
or weren't &quot;real alcoholics.&quot; Either way, the program
itself is always off the hook.

<p>

In other studies, Harvard University found that most
people who stopped using drugs and alcohol and who
remain abstinent simply do it on their own. But most
people don't hear of these successes due to the drum
beat of the treatment industry that would have us all
believe there is only one successful way to attain
sobriety. What happens is AA takes the credit for
people who basically quit, or would have quit on their
own, hence its loyal following.

<p>

Raising issues like these in 12-step meetings or in
treatment facilities are considered anathema.
Criticism/questioning are seen as &quot;denial&quot; or
&quot;willfulness,&quot; which are deemed &quot;disease symptoms.&quot;
Tragically, the program has many built-in, self-defeating
mechanisms which ensure it never changes,
never improves.
Treatment centers which simply groom residents for
lifetime participation in look-good/feel-good programs
like AA vacuum up the lion's share of treatment
related funds &#8212; funds which should be made available
for other programs so that persons interested in
recovery have the option of trying other modes of
treatment. The one-size fits all approach to addiction
and alcohol treatment should be revisited &#8212; and fast.
As AA Trustee Vaillant lamented after his study, &quot;How
can I, a clinician, reconcile my enthusiasm for
(12-step) treatment with such melancholy data?&quot; How
indeed.

<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>
Thank you for answering my e-mail and for printing my
never-to-be-published op-ed letter to my local paper.
When I spotted my letter I said to myself, &quot;Wow, I
made the Orange Papers.&quot; Back in the '60's there were
the &quot;White Papers,&quot; and nowadays we have the &quot;Orange
Papers.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that was the pun. The name is both a take-off on mixing apples and oranges,
(because

the author of www.aadeprogramming.com</a> used the name &quot;Apple&quot;)
and a twist on 'white papers'.
</font>
<p>

Anyway, I'm writing today to make up for a glaring
error on my part: The reason I was able to write that
letter to the editor was due to all your diligent
work, research, and encouragement. I just stole the
material from you and Stanton Peele, to be perfectly
honest!

<p>

Despite my thievery, please keep on keepin' on.

From:  	&quot;Brett W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Question<br>

<p>

Hello-

<p>

Great website! Keep up the good work.
<p>
I wonder if you have come across any information pertaining to how to
obtain life insurance if you have been diagnosed as an alcoholic/addict?
<p>
Here is the quandry I (and I'm sure many like me) face:
<p>
I am an otherwise healthy 30 year old male who has a problem with
alcohol. Bottom line, I cannot touch the stuff. I have finally accepted
that and I have been sober for six months. The bottom line is that this
sobriety is the result of my decision to quit, not the 12 Step programs
that many preach.
<p>
The issue is that in early 2004 I voluntarily checked into rehab. I
asked my intake &quot;couselor&quot; what negative impact this could have on me in
the future, and her response was essentially &quot;we take your medical
insurance, so all will be well&quot;. The &quot;rehab&quot; was a complete joke,
nothing but platitudes and recitations from the &quot;counselors&quot; (side note:
many of these &quot;counselors&quot; have PhD's and a lot of them could not reason
their way out of a paper bag &#8212; what's going on there?). The forced AA
meetings were even more disgraceful... I could not wait to escape those
morose surroundings.
<p>
Anyway, I have a wife and two kids and as part of an estate plan my wife
and I applied for life insurance. On my application I disclosed my
alcoholism and was denied not once, but twice by two separate companies.
The reason for denial was listed as alcoholism, but upon further query,
reps from both companies told me I would never be able to get life
insurance b/c I started drinking again for a period after leaving rehab
and also truthfully disclosed that I do not (and will not) go to AA
under any circumstances. So what to do: do I lie and say I go to
meetings? Do I actually have to go (God forbid) to meetings?
<p>
I am wondering if you or anyone who reads these pages has any input.
<p>
Thanks.

<p>

Brett

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Brett,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments, and thanks for a good question.
I had not heard of that problem before.
Alas, I don't know the answer. Perhaps a reader
has some suggestions. Anyone?
<p>
I can't help but notice that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#stigma" target="_blank">A.A. brags that it removes the stigma from
alcoholism</a>.
And then you get treated like that.

<p>
I don't think that it will help you in the short term, but in the long run, the
people who are fighting against coerced cult religion in America should look
at enforced A.A. as a condition of getting life insurance.
Another correspondent
<a href="orange-letters50.html#mandatory_AA" target="_blank">wrote about a similar problem</a>
in a recent letter &#8212;
mandatory A.A. as a condition of keeping his license to practice medicine.
<p>

This mandatory Buchmanism has to stop.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

A Twelve-Step Program for the Dead<br>
----------------------------------<br>
by Terrel L. Templeman, Ph.D.<br>

<p>

Oregon Trail of Technology

<p>

The <i>Journal of Polymorphous Perversity</i> was the first publication
to address an often neglected though certainly grave topic in the field
of psychotherapy, namely therapy of the dead (Menahem, 1984; Templeman,
1984). Although published studies employing psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy demonstrated promise in clinical trials with dead
clients, mental health professionals have generally found this type of
client most resistant to entering treatment (Burke &amp; Hare, 1988).
Recently, a self-help literature for the dead has been promoted as an
alternative to therapist-directed approaches (Barnum, 1989), but the low
sales of books such as <i>Dead Who Love Too Much</i> and <i>Dead No More</i>
suggest that the dead are not receptive to this approach either.

<p>
My colleagues and I at Oregon Trail of Technology believe that a new
approach to this lifeless field must be undertaken if the dead are to
be engaged in treatment effectively.  We present here for the first
time a 12-step program for the dead, which is modeled closely after
other 12-step programs. Dead Ones Anonymous (DOA) groups allow dead to
meet in supportive, anonymous settings to develop mutual trust and to
realize that they are not alone in their dead pursuits.  Most dead come
from dysfunctional families, and we have encouraged DOA members to
share their feelings about the burden of being unjustly maligned or
irrationally revered by the living, a burden strikingly apparent in the
facial expressions of group members.  Topics in these groups range from
ego boundary problems (especially salient for the borderline dead) to
living up to the expectations of others.  (We have discovered that
living up to anything can be very difficult for the dead.)

<p>
Unlike other 12-step programs, DOA groups are best facilitated by a
non-dead member.  Without at least one living participant, these
meetings often degenerate into protracted and embarrassing silences.
The facilitator also helps to keep participants focused on the 12
steps, not to mention sitting upright in their chairs.

<p>

What Are The 12 Steps?<br>
----------------------<br>

<p>

1. Accept the fact that you are dead.  Stop fighting it.  Remind
yourself that death is simply nature's way of telling you to
slow down.

<p>

2. Take responsibility for your own inertia.  Stop blaming it on
those around you.  Remember, today is the first day of the rest
of your death.

<p>

3. Give your burdens up to a higher power and don't try to play God.
Recite the Serenity Prayer and pray for the wisdom to know the
difference between life and death.

<p>

4. Take a holiday.  In fact, take a vacation once in a while.
Don't take death so seriously.  Remember, you only die once.

<p>

5. Remind yourself that death is a disease.  It begins the day you
are born, progresses until the day you die, and then takes over
completely.  For 10 out of every 10 people, this disease is fatal.

<p>

6. Admit that you are powerless over death.  If you thought life was
unmanageable, just try keep all your loose ends together when you
are dead!

<p>

7. Make a searching and fearless mortal inventory of yourself.  See
what you can find.

<p>

8. Humbly ask someone to see that your grave is kept clean.

<p>

9. Know that you are not alone in this affliction.

<p>

10. Remember that things could always be worse.

<p>

11. Relinquish materialism and let go of worldly possessions.
Remember, you can't take it with you.

<p>

12. Strive for a spiritual awakening as long as you are dead, and
remember:  It's never too late to try for heaven.

<p>

The Role of the Family<br>
----------------------<br>
Family members are encouraged to attend other groups for survivors,
codependants of the dead, and adult children of the dead.  These groups
allow family members to better understand their own dysfunctional
relationships with the dead, usually rooted in an inability to bury the
past.  Toward this end, family members are taught an intervention
called the Internment, which helps them to lay to rest not only
unresolved conflicts with the dead but the body of the problem itself.
Families are generally relieved after the Internment, although for the
dead themselves it is only the first step to recovery.  Thus, therapists
in our program are encouraged to work individually with the dead after
the Internment, as much uncovering is necessary before dead clients are
ready to attend group meetings.

From:  	&quot;rfo&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Where's the money?<br>

<p>

I have been a fan of the Orange Papers for the last few years.  I agree
with and relate to much of what's posted on the site.  I have a
question, though.  I agree that AA has become an institution supported
by a significant number of true believers and society in general.  My
question is, given the apparent problems within AA, what is
the motivation for sustaining this institution?  I realize that the
recovery industry benefits greatly from AA in terms of dollars, but does
AA itself receive a great deal of money from the industry or its own
membership?  Is AA getting big donations from the industry, in violation
of its own traditions?  Just curious. &#8212; RFO

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi RFO,
<p>

The reasons for maintaining A.A. are both corporate and individual.
That is, the corporation executives at the top have one set of motives to keep
A.A. going, while the true believers at the bottom have a different set.
I've already made a couple of lists of the reasons that the true believers
stay in A.A., here:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters40.html#LauriJean" target="_blank">Why people stay in cults</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters3.html#why_cult" target="_blank">Why people stay in cults</a>
</ol>

<p>
Institutions strive to maintain their own existence. That is true of all
institutions, no matter whether it is General Motors, the Catholic Church, or
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>

At the A.A. corporate headquarters, the executives enjoy both status and
a healthy income. The members of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
[World] Services, Inc., get $70,000 per year, and the President of the corporation
gets $125,000.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<p>
Corporate A.A. is supported in a variety of ways. First off, they get millions from the
sales of books like the <i>Big Book</i> and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
They also collect royalties from all of the foreign countries that publish
the <i>Big Book</i>, or its translations, in spite of the fact that it is
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">not legally copyrighted</a>.
<p>
A.A.W.S. (Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.) has even
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">committed perjury in
the courts of Mexico and Germany</a>
to get A.A. members sentenced to prison for printing their own inexpensive unapproved
versions of the out-of-copyright 1st edition of the <i>Big Book</i>.
Just protecting the profits, you know.

<p>
Then A.A. is not above taking outside contributions. They got over $100,000 from
the city of San Diego for holding a convention there. Who knows how much they
get from
<a href="orange-letters22.html#Hazelden" target="_blank">the Hazelden Foundation</a>,
which is the biggest distributor of A.A.W.S.
publications in the world. Hazelden is also one of the biggest promoters and
proselytizers for A.A. in the world too &#8212; they are another bunch of 12-Step true believers.

<p>
A.A. receives support from the treatment center industry too.
I don't know the numbers for cash contributions, but I know that as far as
membership goes, the treatment centers are all just recruiting agencies
for Alcoholics Anonymous.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Come to group therapy three times a week, and
attend at least three A.A. meetings per week.&quot;
</font>
In residential treatment centers, it's A.A. every day, and they do their
best to convince the clients that they must stay in A.A. for the rest of their lives.
<p>
Then there are the proselytizers who have a vested interest in appearing
to be wise and knowledgeable. A lot of them got Ph.D.s by promoting 12-Step
treatment. The last thing they want to do is admit that they
have wasted years and their professional reputations by promoting a
cult religion that is completely ineffective for making people quit killing
themselves with alcohol.
Look at frauds and deceptions like these:

From:  	&quot;anthony k.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Last throw of the AA dice<br>

<p>

Hello again, Orange.
<p>
How are things?
<p>
Keeping up the good work, I see.
<p>
Here's a link and a question.<br>
The link is to the web-site of a new meeting that a friend and I are
starting this week.<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005630/http://www.aa-nomusts.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.aa-nomusts.org.uk/</a>

<p>

The question is a tough one, so you might want to have a bit of a sit down:<br>
What has been the reaction to this meeting of those members not involved?<br>
a) Warm congratulations;<br>
b) Indifference;<br>
c) Barbed comments, hysterical accusations that it's not AA and a campaign
of misinformation, largely centring on accusations that it's for atheists
only.

<p>

If you said (a) or (b), then I may have over-estimated you!
<p>
If you look at the site, you might recognise some of the FAQ stuff and the
alternative preamble from the Agnostic groups in America. I went to one in
Greenwich Village on a recent business trip and it provided the final
motivation to do this. It's what I think a meeting should be like, but to
say I'm in a minority is an understatement.
<p>
I think we both know what kind of mindset you have to be in to interpret
genuine neutrality as a threat and, frankly, if this proves more trouble
than it's worth, I think that's probably it for AA and me (my friend feels
the same).
<p>
I must admit to being torn. I do want to help struggling alcoholics and I do
want to help spare them all the crap they get foisted on them in AA while
too vulnerable and frightened to resist, but on the other hand, I've got a
great life and I have better things to do than argue basic facts with a
bunch of membots (see definition below. I think this is a concept you will
want to use, if you haven't already. I've seen you refer to memes before).
My wife and I spent a glorious month on holiday in Australia earlier this
year. I didn't go to any meetings during that month and it was fine, of
course. I went to one on the day I got back and had the distinct feeling
that I was hearing a load of strange talk that had no bearing on my life
(and that I could happily live without).
<p>
Your site has helped accelerate and support a process of reverting to good
sense that was already underway in me. AA looks distinctly weird now and I
thank you for that.

<p>

Anthony K.

<p>

MEMBOT: A person whose entire life has become subordinated to the
propagation of a meme, robotically and at any opportunity. (Such as many
Jehovah's Witnesses, Krishnas, and Scientologists.) Due to internal
competition, the most vocal and extreme membots tend to rise to the top of
their sociotype's hierarchy. A self-destructive membot is a memeoid.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Anthony,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That is both informative and amusing.
And thanks for the thanks.
And good luck with your meeting.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Very interesting reading but...<br>

<p>

Who are you?

<p>

I've been where you have been and I had that funny feeling that
something wasn't right.  My sister is an AA guru but I just couldn't buy
into the steps &#8212; especially the First Step although I went through 10 of
them a few years ago.

<p>

I think I see a ray of hope if I can de-program myself.  I am a believer
in God but I can't accept that He wanted us to feel this way &#8212;
powerless. This idea of being powerless, in fact, has exacerbated my
problem.

<p>

Thanks for your research and personal observations of the program
(cult).  Maybe I'm not as crazy as I thought I was.

<p>

I'll continue to read and think (a God-given capability) and then come
to a conclusion regarding my path.

<p>

Linda

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Linda,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You don't sound crazy to me.
<p>
The idea behind the &quot;powerless&quot; doctrine is to make you feel so weak and
helpless and desperate that you will surrender to the cult. That's why
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#surrender" target="_blank">Frank Buchman declared</a>
that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You have been defeated by sin, and you are powerless over it.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">Bill Wilson just changed that</a>
to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are powerless over alcohol.&quot;
</font>
<p>
In either case, the only hope that they held out was to surrender your will to the cult,
and trust that the cult would save your soul or your life.
(Step 3.)
<p>

And you most assuredly can deprogram yourself, and recover.
See the web page on <a href="orange-deprogram.html" target="_blank">How To Deprogram Your Own Mind</a>.
<p>
And remember that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the Harvard Medical School reported</a>
that 4 out of 5 of the successful quitters &#8212; alcoholics who
abstained from alcohol for a year or more &#8212; did it alone, on their own.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	After more reading<br>

<p>

I see that I've been led on a political path.  PLEASE &#8212; you can select
quote anyone you want to get the desired result of lies in all its forms
&#8212; especially from politicians!  You quote facts where it becomes your
agenda but nothing to represent your opposition.

<p>

Remember step 4 or is it 5 ? about listing your positive qualities as
well as your immoral ones?

<p>

You've removed yourself from the arena in my head.  Maybe you should
blog your personal political views on some other website.

<p>

I am a registered Republican.  Do I agree with everything that's going
on and the decisions being made by our elected officials on either side
of the fence?  No.

<p>

But when I go to a website about alternatives to AA I don't expect to
get your biases about other issues.

<p>

Linda

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Linda,
<p>
I do not subscribe to the A.A. policy of &quot;no outside issues&quot;.<br>
I do not see life in the real world as an outside issue.
<p>
What is the point of recovering from drugs, alcohol and tobacco, only to get killed off
by industrial pollution or an elective war?<br>
Or a civil war when the oil runs out?
<p>
Beware of that word &quot;expect&quot;. It is one of the
key words that reveal irrational beliefs.
You can make yourself miserable &#8212; even insane &#8212; by expecting the world to be a certain
way and then being constantly disappointed when the world chooses to do something else.

<p>
The same moral and ethical standards that tell me it is wrong to foist
quack medicine and cult religion on sick addicts also tell me that it
is wrong to kill children with <i>Shock And Awe</i> bombing in a war
that some lying politicians chose to get into (for the oil in Iraq).
<p>
Why should I speak out on the first issue but remain meek and silent on the second
issue?
(And it's my web site and I can mix issues as much as I wish.)
<p>

I don't know which signature ticked you off, but whichever it was, I haven't even
used some of my most critical ones yet.

<p>
You think that I am just prejudiced against Republicans? Think again. It's just that
the current sleazy politicians who are running the show are Republicans.
And they rate a lot of criticism.
<p>
Heck, the last good Republican was Barry Goldwater. Now there was a man with some principles.
They don't make'em like that any more.
<p>
Barry Goldwater would be appalled and up in arms at the current crop of amoral
unprincipled neo-Cons.
<p>

As far as Clinton goes, I think he sold us down the river with NAFTA and GAT,
and he was too busy messing around with Monica to deal with the coming oil crisis.
<p>
It is likely that some of your grandchildren and great grandchildren,
and some of mine too, will die because of the
stupidity of the last four Presidents: Reagan, Bush 1, Clinton, and Bush 2.
<ol>
<li> Jimmy Carter started a lot of alternative energy projects because he knew that
the oil was going to run out, and we had to get ready for it.
<li> Reagan stupidly shut down all of those projects.
<li> Bush 1 didn't restart them.
<li> Clinton stupidly did not bother to restart those projects, either.
<li> Bush 2 won't restart them.
</ol>
<p>
Now it's 25 years later, the end is much closer, the price of oil is rising rapidly,
and it isn't going to come back down, and we haven't done a darned thing
about switching our industrial base to something other than petroleum.
<p>
We need a lot of time and energy to switch over our entire way of living.
We won't have it if we wait until the end of the oil and then try to make the switch.
The amount of infrastructure rebuilding that must be done is staggering, and
it will take many years &#8212; probably a whole generation. Maybe more.
(As if we had that much time.)

<p>

Our food comes from big agribusiness, which runs on petroleum.
They use oil for everything from powering the tractors to making insecticides and
herbicides, to powering the trucks and diesel locomotives that bring the food to you.
Likewise, the fertilizers come from natural gas, which is also running out,
and it will get burned up fast as the oil runs out.
<p>
Without petroleum, where are you planning on getting the food for your grandchildren?

<p>
Do you really imagine that Bush's occupation of Iraq is going to get us all of the
oil that we need?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. And stay sober, in spite of the fact that
Bush isn't giving you any reason to do so.

<a name="divorce"> </a>
Date:  	Fri, June 2, 2006 05:47<br>
From:  	&quot;L.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Divorce<br>

<p>

Thank you for a site with a cerebrum, not just a brain stem. I will
keep this missive short, au point.

<p>

Do you have stats on the correlation between AA and divorce rates? My
situation, in a nutshell (well, a big nut, say, Brazil):

<p>

My husband is suing me for custody of children. Ostensibly, this is
based on 1) extended breastfeeding (we have a 3-year-old), which he is
alleging to be sexual molestation, and 2) my &quot;addictions&quot; and need for
a &quot;recovery program.&quot; (I drink  1-2 glasses of wine a day , or did, and
take prescribed medication for depression. And that really is all,
folks. But, of course, I'm in &quot;denial.&quot;)

<p>

Okay, he also invaded my personal computer and found some writings he
didn't much care for. But, of course, that has nothing to do with the
&quot;real issues.&quot;

<p>

My husband is a recovering alcoholic. He has been in and out of AA on
his own terms. Following his reading of my computer, he went to his
first AA meeting in months. He received Instant Sponsor, now his daily
guru. Directly following the meeting, he made plans, oh yes. The next
day my computer was gone. Our bank account was drained. And, on a minor
note, our kids were gone. For nearly a week. I was issued an ex parte
restraining order based on unspeakable lies.

<p>

Last year, my husband also demanded a divorce and custody (that time,
because he was the &quot;breadwinner.&quot;). This also directly followed an AA
meeting and a new sponsor. (who my husband later spurned because
apparently this person was trying to get him into the Amway pyramid).

<p>

My husband has changed, since his indoctrination into AA five years
ago, into a person I truly don't know. I applaud him for his sobriety.
But he has told me repeatedly that if I don't join him in &quot;recovery&quot;
(including giving up my &quot;misplaced values&quot; related to political and
social activism) that we cannot have a &quot;happy marriage.&quot; He reads the
Bible every night, now. Wow. I am not searching for Serenity, per said
husband. He is. He does not seem terribly Serene, nor grateful for
much, but what do I know? I dare to have anger. How unevolved.

<p>

Any information will help. Perhaps these are mere coincidences.
Oh &#8212; but, there ARE not &quot;coincidences,&quot; are there?

<p>
thanks.

<p>
L

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi L.
<p>
They are not coincidences at all. You are describing a textbook case of Stepper.
That's what the cult does to people. That's one of the reasons that I am so down on it.
<p>

I don't have any statistics about the divorce rates of Steppers, but I know that
it is high. Bill Wilson approved of divorce in the <i>Big Book</i>, in an indirect way.<br>
Look

And:
<a href="orange-letters15.html#AA_divorces" target="_blank">more on A.A. divorces</a>.

<p>
Something that I really would bring up in court is the fact that Alcoholics
Anonymous told your husband to divorce you, for the sake of his sobriety
&#8212; A.A. broke up the marriage.
What if A.A. next tells your husband to dump the kids? &#8212; Again, in the
selfish interest of his sobriety, of course?

<p>
As a courtroom tactic, I would bring up the whole A.A. routine of just how bad
alcoholics are. Read the file
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i> Conspiracy</a>&quot;.
<ol>
<li>
I would ask him whether the teachings of Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous are true.
<li>
He will probably argue that they are.
<li>
Then ask him how a horrible person like Bill Wilson described as <i>the alcoholic</i>
could possibly be trusted with the care of children.
</ol>
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Your lawyer:
<ul>
<li>
&quot;Bill Wilson wrote on pages 61 and 62 of the <i>Big Book</i> that alcoholics
are selfish and self-centered and egotistical, and extreme examples of self-will run riot.<br>
<li>
On page 82 Bill said that
<font color="#4f007f">
'The alcoholic is like a tornado roaring his way through the lives of others.'</font><br>
<li>
On page 86 Bill wrote that alcoholics are undisciplined.<br>
<li>
On page 125 Bill said,
<font color="#4f007f">
'Many alcoholics are enthusiasts. They run to extremes.'</font><br>
<li>
On page 53 of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, Bill Wilson wrote:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
'But it is from our twisted relations with family, friends, and society at large
that many of us have suffered the most. We have been especially stupid
and stubborn about them. The primary fact that we fail to recognize is
our total inability to form a true partnership with another human being.
Our egomania digs two disastrous pitfalls. Either we insist upon dominating
people we know, or we depend on them far too much.'</font>

<li>
Is that an accurate description of your personality?&quot;<br>
</ul>
<li>
Husband: &quot;No.&quot;<br>
<li>
Your lawyer: &quot;Then are you telling this court that Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous
are all wrong about alcoholics and alcoholism?&quot;
<li>
Husband: &quot;No.&quot;
</ol>

<p>
He can't have it both ways.

<p>
And again,<br>
<ol>
<li>
Your lawyer: &quot;Your previous sponsor told you to get rid of your wife, so you did.
What if your next sponsor tells you to get rid of the kids because they
are interfering with your sobriety? Will you do that? If your wife is expendable in
the pursuit of your own happiness, why aren't the kids also expendable?&quot;

<li>
Husband: &quot;Well I love my children.&quot;
<li>
Your lawyer: &quot;Didn't you love your wife?&quot;
<li>
Husband: &quot;Well, yeh, at one time.&quot;
<li>
Your lawyer: &quot;So you loved your wife, and then suddenly you didn't.
So why can't you just as suddenly stop loving your children? Especially if your sponsor
tells you to? Doesn't that sound just like what Bill Wilson described:
<font color="#4f007f">
'The primary fact that we fail to recognize is
our total inability to form a true partnership with another human being.'</font>?&quot;
</ol>

<p>
And on and on. Bill Wilson gave you a ton of ammunition, in all of his ravings about
how bad alcoholics are, and how untrustworthy and selfish and warped and evil...

<p>
<ol>
<li> And have your lawyer ask your husband whether he admires Bill Wilson and wishes to emulate him.
<li> He will probably say yes. Most hard-core Steppers do.
<li>
Then the lawyer should bring up all of the issues about
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's constant philandering</a> and
<li>
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">talking to ghosts in s&eacute;ances</a>, and

<p>
Also don't overlook the fact that Bill Wilson taught contemptuous treatment of wives.

Your husband is faithfully following Bill's instructions.

<p>
That is some suggestions, just for starters.

Good luck, and don't hesistate to check back if you have any more questions.

And have a good day.

I felt pain when I read the above posting. I imagine she

a lot of woman in AA.....&quot;rageaholics&quot; &amp; &quot;control freaks&quot;. I imagine it is

or sexually abused [as a child] &amp; has used you as a &quot;scapegoat&quot; to
medicate her pain, fear, shame &amp; anger.

<p>

I wondered if you were abandoning yourself by responding to her diatribe

You are a good man &amp; I support you 100%! I hope you have adapted to my

Hi, about responding to her diatribe &#8212; I felt that it was
an opportunity to show and counter a zillion of the

She was just so insistantly declaring that A.A. saved

also bragged that A.A. wasn't scientific or empirical

<p>

Hi Orange
<p>
I wondered how you felt after her [Jenni J] onslaught. I imagine you
would have felt some pain &amp; shame. I can relate to &quot;Jenni&quot;.....making
the other person wrong, etc. I imagine by making you wrong she [Jenni]
can feel :&quot;better than&quot;! What I have learned &#8212; it's not about being
right or wrong but what feelings are triggered.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Micky,
<p>
Yep, it's about feelings. But I don't feel &quot;pain and shame&quot; from such attacks.
Maybe a little defensive, as I double-check myself to see if there is any truth
in the attacks. But there generally isn't. Such people fly into a tizzy because
they feel that their whole world is threatened. It's like their life is a house of
cards and they see me about to knock out one of the bottom cards.
So they react rather badly.


</font>
<p>

I imagine some  of your postings [pro-AA] are not about you or AA but
from the senders' childhood. I get a sense that whatever you say to an
&quot;AA Fundamentalist&quot;, would fall on deaf ears, anyway. Most AA's are
terrified &amp; if someone like you comes along &amp; explains the truth to
them, their reaction is going to be similar to &quot;Jenni's&quot;.....terrified
of being exposed as &quot;frauds&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
True.
</font>
<p>

That is what intimacy is all about.....&quot;me being me &amp; letting you see
me&quot; [feelings expressed]. Most AA' are so emotionally shut down &amp; the
Wilson/Smith &quot;bullshit&quot; keeps them shutdown &amp; in their &quot;heads&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sadly, yeh.
</font>
<p>

I imagine that the AA's that do respond to you in a positive manner are
the ones who intuitively know that something is not right [AA] &amp; someone
like you [Orange] comes along &amp; gives them permission to question the
&quot;Guru&quot; [Wilson].

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, that's what I see too.

</font>
<p>

So keep up the good work.... you are a &quot;gutsy&quot; man &amp; I &quot;love&quot; [platonic]
you. I suppose I wondered how you dealt with your feelings.... I imagine
you have  support. I care about you.... society needs people like you.
You are constantly in my prayers!

<p>

Peace Be With You
Micky

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for all of the compliments Micky. The way that I deal with most of those feelings
is that I don't have them. That is, I don't feel wounded or injured when attacked by
the Steppers who are going postal. (&quot;Going Postal&quot; is an American expression derived from
the story of a mailman who went to the post office and shot up the place,
including a bunch of his co-workers, because he was upset about something or other.
It basically means &quot;way over-reacting&quot;. Synonyms include &quot;going ballistic&quot; and
&quot;going non-linear&quot;.)
<p>
When I am attacked by such Steppers, I consider the source, and realize that
they just can't handle the truth. It would undermine their whole philosophy and
world view (German: <i>Weltanschauung</i>).
Such attacks merely verify everything I've been saying about
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think" target="_blank">Group-think</a>&quot;
in the Cult Test.
<p>
What I really feel most of all is sadness that this is still the current
state of the human race. If some little green men from Mars came to visit,
I would have a really hard time explaining my species to them, other than to
say that, &quot;Look, you've got to understand that they are just a bunch of dumb cavemen.
They aren't very smart, or very rational, sometimes. Give'em another two million
years or so, and they might get better.&quot;

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>

It is quite obvious that you do not have a clue as to what A.A. is all
about.
<p>
A cult! Not likely. A cult usuall follows a single leader. There are no
leaders in A.A.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, TD,
<p>
There seems to be an echo in here. I just dealt with that one,
<a href="orange-letters47.html#charismatic_leader" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Lots of cults, including Scientology, the Hari Krishnas, and Alcoholics
Anonymous, have dead leaders who are revered as holy men or saints or
wise men or something extremely good.
<p>
In addition,
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_charismatic" target="_blank">The Charismatic Leader</a>
is only 1 of 100 cult characteristics that I have listed in my
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Cult Test</a>.
Most cults start off with a charismatic leader, but not all do.
<p>
The charismatic leader, by itself, does not define a group as a cult one way or the other.
The whole of the USA was not a cult just because President John F. Kennedy was very charismatic
and charming.
</font>
<p>

Each group is run independantly and each group decides
by vote as to what type of meeting they will have. There is no specific
God that is worshiped. If you choose a lightbulb to be your higher power
so be it. That is between you and your light bulb. G.O.D. can stand for
a Group Of Drunks, hardly a cultThere are more rules at a football game
than at A.A. Iguess everyone who enjoys going to a Redsox game or a
Football game are cultists. So are
Catholics,Jews,Protistants,Hindues,Arabs,Budists
Democrats,Republicans,Union Members  P.T.O's ,Cub scouts  etc. Get real
your an idiot.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. A.A. is all standardized. You start the meeting by reading
the same plastic-laminated dogma from pages 58 through 60 of the
<i>Big Book</i>, including the Twelve Steps and The Twelve Traditions.
And then you ask if there are any newcomers or people from out of town,
and then you have some speaker who delivers some rap or other, after reading
a quote from one of the holy books like &quot;As Bill Sees It&quot;. Then
people start &quot;sharing&quot; their stories, and then the basket is
passed around for the Seventh Tradition.
Then you give away some sobriety tokens.
Then more sharing, and
then you close the meeting by standing in a circle, holding hands
and reciting the Lord's Prayer.
<p>
It's more standardized than a McDonald's franchise.
<p>
Now I know that you have a few variations on that formula,
like <i>Big Book</i> Study Groups and such,
but it is still all standardized.
</font>

<p>
As far as the judges sentencing all types of offenders to A.A. the one
thing you seem to overlook is the common thread that a vast majority of
those crimes where commited while the person was under the influence.
Many people will due something under the influence that they would not
do straight. It does not excuse it but if you take the boose out of the
bad guy you take the bad guy out of society. Its that simple you dope.
My brother spent 15 days inb jail for possesion of marijauna. If he did
not smoke pot he would not have gone to jail.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You have completely missed the point that it is wrong, unConstitutional, to sentence
somebody to a religion or religious service, <i>no matter what they have done</i>.
</font>
<p>

<p>
He told me that almost all of the people he spoke with in there did some
thing wrong while under the influence and when they came to and found
out what they had done they where just as horrified about their crime as
the rest of us.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Welcome to reality. That still doesn't mean that it is okay to sentence
people to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. How would you like it if the judge
changed his mind and started sentencing everybody to Church of Scientology
&quot;auditing&quot; sessions instead?
</font>
<p>

<p>
Addiction is a disease.A.A. is the medicine that can cure the disease if
it is taken. Would you call people that recieve chemotherapy for cancer
cultists?.... I bet you would.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but if alcoholism is a real disease, then real doctors should treat it and
cure it, just like they do with cancer, diabetes, and heart attacks.

<p>
A.A. has no qualifications for treating diseases.
You guys are not doctors. You haven't gone to medical school.
<p>
Where do you get off defining the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;
and then claiming that only you are qualified to treat the disease?
<p>
When did God appoint you the Surgeon General?
Why are you entitled to practice medicine without a license?

<p>
By the way, alcoholism is not a disease. It is compulsive behavior &#8212; basically
one very big, very bad habit.
It can be a horrible addiction, and addicts can be deathly ill, but &quot;alcoholism&quot;
is still not a disease.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	sidebar questions<br>
Date:  	Fri, June 2, 2006 10:06<br>

<p>

I am trying to read as much info on your site before submitting a question.

<p>

But this one just sprung up.  What is the possibility that Bill Wilson
was on Buchman's payroll somewhere, to implement AA as a vehicle to help
recruit members for the dying Oxford group?  I would imagine Frank may
have had some spare change lying around for that.  Lois, if I am not
mistaken, was a strong advocate.  Maybe the MRA gave them a small
stipend to keep them remaining loyal to its principles?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the questions.
<p>
On this one, there is little doubt that
the Oxford Group didn't like Bill Wilson, and they wanted him gone. He was committing
the most unforgiveable sin that someone can commit in a cult &#8212; he was setting himself
up as the leader of a sub-sect who was in competition with the cult leader. That's really the
ultimate no-no.
<p>
And then Bill Wilson insisted on dragging in a lot of ragged down-and-out alcoholics.
Frank Buchman preferred the company of princes and millionaires.
One of Rev. Shoemaker's assistants gave a Sunday morning sermon on the subject of
Bill's &quot;Alcoholic Squadron&quot;, denouncing
&quot;the divergent work of this secret group&quot;.
<p>
They just really didn't like Bill's style, so they slandered and
'bad-vibed' him out the door.
<p>
Bill's continuing to promote the beliefs of Buchmanism seems to be that he just
believed in it, calling it &quot;the spiritual principles&quot;, as if they were simply
the only ones. It might also be that Bill just didn't have anything else to sell.

</font>
<p>

Buchman looks like he could have been a child molester, he seems to fit
the profile and back then molesters weren't persecuted as heavily as today.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I won't argue with that. I often think he looked pretty creepy. There isn't
any documentation or evidence on the child molester charge, though. There
is just a vague suspicion, like why did he
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#Hartford1" target="_blank">leave Hartford Seminary</a> so suddenly
after he was ordered to move out of the boys' dorm?
What was he doing sleeping in the boys' dorm in the first place?
He was 38 years old!
</font>
<p>

<a name="war_record"> </a>
a sidebar-  What about Lt./Capt.(?) Wilson during his years in WW I?
There was a giant downsizing of troops then, but what about his military
records, I would guess it was honorable?  What kind of leader was he?
Who were his troops that he led; and what do they have to say about his
character?  It seems that his history during the war was a giant
vacuum.  Normal people would have enlightening stories abounding with
experiences.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are going to love this: It is hilarious. The reason why they don't talk much about
Bill's war record is because he didn't have one. Bill lucked out and never saw combat.
He never fired a single shot, or ducked a single bullet.
He got into the war late, and when his unit got to Great Britain, they were stalled there
for months by an outbreak of the Spanish Influenza in France.
That gave Bill the time to go exploring England and to have a
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#spiritual_experience" target="_blank">&quot;spiritual experience&quot;
in Winchester Cathedral</a>.
By the time they got to France, the war only lasted for two more weeks.
 Even luckier, Wilson was stationed in
a small mountain town far from the front. Bill stayed there for a few months after the
armistice, and then went home.

<p>
Now here's the fun part: For Bill, the most exciting part of the war
was when Lt. Wilson pulled out his pistol and pointed it at his own men
and demanded that they obey his orders.
<p>
What happened was, they were on the troop ship sailing from the USA to Great Britain, and
one night, when they were approaching England, there was the sound of a
terrible explosion, and the ship was rocked by the
blast. Bill and his men were below decks in their bunks when it happened. The men
believed that the ship had been torpedoed by a German U-boat, so they
immediately headed for the deck. Bill stopped them. They wanted to head for the lifeboats,
but Bill pulled out his pistol and aimed it at them and threatened to shoot them if
they didn't obey his orders. So Bill kept them just waiting down in the bottom of
the ship.
<p>
After a while it became obvious that the ship wasn't sinking. Later, they would
learn that the Navy thought they saw a German U-boat, so they tossed a depth charge
real close to Bill's ship. That was the bang.
<p>
Bill Wilson felt that he had passed the test of war by remaining cool
while his men were &quot;panicking&quot;.

<p>
It is amusing to read the various biographies of Bill Wilson, and see how different
authors handled and glorified this incident.
<p>
First, here is Robert Thomsen:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...there was a crash so overwhelming that it toppled a small table and sent its contents
flying to the floor. For a moment Bill stood staring stupidly at the table;
he felt a wave of nausea sweep over him. In another second every man was awake,
out of his bunk, racing for the stairs. But Bill's pistol was drawn, and he was
barking orders. And there was no doubt in any of their minds that he meant them.
If they moved, if they dared take one more step, his pistol would be used.
They waited, all eyes staring up at him, but there was no second crash, only the
sound of the motors as the <i>Lancaster</i> moved steadily ahead. Later, they
found out that a destroyer sailing very close at their side had spotted a sub and
dropped an &quot;ashcan&quot; off her stern, and the crash of the impact so close to the
<i>Lancaster</i>'s hull had given every indication of a direct hit.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When finally Bill was relieved of his watch and had crawled up the hatchway and
out onto the deck, the sky was growing brighter in the east...
...the dot ahead was land. ... A British blimp was coming out to meet them.
... They had made it.
... But more, much more than this, <i>he</i> had come through the night, faced
terror and escaped humiliation. There'd been no panic on his deck because he
had been there, and as he stood watching the blimp's approach he felt more
complete in himself than ever before.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W.</i>, Robert Thomsen, pages 116-117.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Umm, pardon a stupid question, but if you think that your ship has been
torpedoed, why would you just sit and wait for a second crash?
Waiting for the U-boat to torpedo you again?
<p>
Here is the Hazelden Foundation staff, ghost-writing Bill Wilson's
&quot;autobiography&quot; for him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
...I was musing away when suddenly there was an ear-shattering crash.
Thinking about it afterward, it reminded me of the time I stuck my head inside
the old church bell, and a kid pounded the bell with a rock.
It was utterly shattering, and the ship trembled and shook, and I thought
to myself, &quot;This is it.&quot;
Then a rush from the bunks started. Sleeping men making for the hatchways. And
I found I had to offer to shoot them to stop it. And the minute I drew my gun
and quieted those people down, although we all thought our number was up and
not a chance, another tremendous spiritual experience, this wave of complete
confidence and exaltation. The feeling, &quot;Well, you aren't yellow after all.&quot;<br>

Francis Hartigan's treatment of the incident can only be called a gloss-over:

Bill had trained for war, but he had been fearful of what he would do when
confronted with the &quot;real thing.&quot; When an explosion rocked the British ship
carrying him and his men to England, he discovered that his leadership
ability extended beyond the parade grounds. Instinctively, he took charge
and said the right things. His calm but firm orders quelled the panic and
stopped his men from stampeding dangerously toward the stairway leading up to
the deck. They thought they were under attack by German U-boats, but it was
only a depth charge dropped by a passing destroyer that exploded near their
ship. This event, and an artillery exercise that sent a shell nearly on top
of his position, was the closest Bill came to combat.<br>

Bill's rank was Second Lieutenant. He said that he was supposed to get a promotion
but &quot;my promotion got lost in the mails somehow and it didn't show up.&quot;
(p.40, <i>My First 40 Years</i>)

<p>
I read in one account that Bill was supposedly liked and respected by his men and
that they bought him some kind of going-away present at the end of the war,
but I can't find anything about that in the three biographies I have on hand.

<p>
(I may be highly prejudiced, but I can't see myself liking a lieutenant who
threatened to either shoot or drown me.)

Also, I forwarded your site to my &quot;sponsor&quot; of 15 years, who compared
you to the likes of the UniBomber!!!

Now that's funny, because if he saw me, he would be even more likely to think
that. I also have long hair and a fuzzy beard. No cabin in the woods with bombs, though.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi James,
<p>
Thanks for the reference. I always liked Dr. Jeffrey Schaler.
He speaks truth.
<p>
I just added that link to
<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">the links page</a>.
The Talbott story is one of the more outrageous pieces of malpsychia and malpractice
in the so-called &quot;recovery industry&quot; lately, right down there with
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Straight" target="_blank">the Straights</a>.
<p>
But I don't know if America is waking up. Maybe very very slowly...

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
