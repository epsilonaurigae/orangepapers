From:  	&quot;patrick l.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	thanks<br>

<p>

have been clean/sober 18 years now.... and so much of what you said
rings true.... never DID buy: powerlessness, progressive disease
theory, god/as/doorknob, big book/as/bible, fake-it-til-u-make-it.....
the thing that infuriated me the most was when someone would
say&quot; if you don't  blahblah... you're gonna drink&quot;...... am seriously
thinking about cult-like aspects.... it's clear that AA IS a
religion... and that it dominates treatment modalities (knew this
before, but never connected the dots before)..... consistently
arrived late to meetings so as not to have to hear the
readings.... honestly don't think i could even repeat back to anyone
the 12 steps or trads....... DID have a great sponsor, though, who
has given me good advice on all non-AA aspects of my life..... so
i've been lucky...... although, when i mentioned to him about sending
him your  writings, he said he &quot;didn't have time to read any anti-AA
literature... that it worked for me, so why bother&quot;...... which gave me
pause...... have been reading SOS and RR literature... SOS seems more
sensibly able to find ways to remain in dialogue with 12-steppers.....
i suppose the biggest revelation to me was that i simply
had a spontaneous recovery..... and that i don't have to accept any
more AA dogma.... was raised a roman catholic..... and, as we know,
roman catholicism still essentially says all other religions/
christian denominations are HERETICS (soft-pedalled these days to:
&quot;only the roman catholic church possesses the fulness of truth.&quot;).... so
it's a relief to know that i can go back to wrestling with my deepest
fixed  catholic beliefs instead of wasting any more time as a 12-stepper!

<p>

thanks,

Subject:  	Wow<br>

<p>

It seems that membership in a 12-step program alters one's ability to write
coherently in English.  Even if you take mis-used apostrophes and ALL CAPS off the
table, the terrified Buchmanistic ramblings of the emails you get is truly
startling.  Here, let's play A.A.:

<p>
<center>
<table width="93%" border="4" bordercolor="green" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

&#8212; You have OVIOUSLY never been a alcoholic because if you was one you would know
that THERE IS NO BETTER WAY too stay sober than by sitting in meetings four the rest
of your life!

<p>

&#8212; It's a shame that you cant find a better way to chanel your energy then by bashing
the one true religion which has helped milions of people like me.

<p>

&#8212; ALL I KNOW IS KEEP COMING BACK WERE SAVING A SEAT FOR YOU MY FREIND FOR WHEN YOU
DECIDE TOO GET HONIST AND ADMIT YOUR A DRY DRUNK.

<p>

&#8212; You take your path and I will take mine because that it what it says in the bible
or don't you read? Your bible because if you did.  THAN you would know about Bill
wilson and how hes holy and take's the most despirate alchoholics and make's them
better we are not bad people trying to get good we are sick people with a diseas.

<p>

&#8212; You're site is FULL OF LIES and you MISINTERPRET what the steps are all about.
You mus t not halve been to many meeting or you would no that it is a FELOWSHIP
plane and simple you are reading to much into a SIMPEL PROGRAM meant four
complicated peaple.

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>

You must want to pull your hair out sometimes.  I would never have the patience to
produce such a well-researched, articulate body of work, much less respond to a
constant stream of truly idiotic emails.  I mean, the steppers are really really
good at ignoring the actual issue, aren't they?  They don't read the intro, they
don't look at the footnotes.  Because they are afraid.  That was always my problem
with &quot;the program.&quot;  Rigorously honest, my ass.  Any reasoned question was
consistently met with not just fear, but TERROR.  Unnecessary, isn't it?  I was
just talking about books I'd read, people I'd talked to.  But the response was
consistently attack.  Vicious, condescending comments wrapped in a folksy &quot;look at
how cute and misguided this lost lamb is&quot; tone.

<p>

But you know what was behind those patronizing, fatherly smiles?  The terror of
having their whole set of (wrong-headed) values turned upside down.  Superstition.
The urge to balk at, to belittle, to banish those who question.

<p>

I imagine that you are actually a man of great compassion, because I would never be
able to sign off with a cheery(ish) &quot;oh well, have a good day anyway&quot; after reading
and responding to so many outlandish emails &#8212; messages which continually ignore the
main premise:  AA doesn't work.  I especially love the fanatics who write things
like &quot;just leave us alone,&quot; ignoring the conspicuous fact that it was THEY who found
their way to YOUR website.

<p>

Wow.

<p>

If you post this, no last name please &#8212; I don't need a lecture from any of these nuts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, John,
<p>
Thanks for the laugh. That's good. I needed that. And thanks for all of the complments.

<p>

Wow.  Finally, someone who says what I've been thinking for years.  I
grew up with an alcoholic father; married an alcoholic man; watched my
oldest son turn to alcohol and start down the same road as his father;
watched my brother ruin his life with alcohol, and watched my mother
join the &quot;if you can't lick'em, join'em&quot; club.

<p>

I get sick and tired of society leaning on the excuse that they have a
disease.  I've never understood it and have always been made to feel
guilty for not understanding and having compassion for  &quot;the disease&quot;.

<p>

Thank you for validating my thoughts and feelings.

From:  	&quot;keneth d.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	thanks for website<br>

<p>

as your site has pointed out, the AA concept of the deity or &quot;higher
power&quot; is not very congruent with most christian groups.  However, at
least in my area, it seems that the denominations are more than
welcoming of AA.  Perhaps the idea of &quot;never drinking&quot; and in the more
modern &quot;politically correct terms&quot;, &quot;(some people) never drinking&quot; is an
attractive feature of the 12 steps, despite an inconsistency in the
basic theology.  I do agree that AA  has had greater failure rates than
success rates, overall.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Keneth,
<p>
I tend to agree. It seems that the ministers are doing a lot of rationalizing
to gloss over the theological differences, imagining that A.A. saves a lot of alcoholics,
so it is a <i>*Very Good Thing*</i>, and we should just ignore the theological
differences in the interests of the Greater Good. Alas, their logic would fall apart
if they realized that A.A. doesn't actually have a success rate &#8212; that it has a failure
rate and increased death rate.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Agent Orange,

<p>

Am looking over some things on your site again.

<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;(3) understandable by the general public. Therefore, the committee

<p>

I was not aware that there is any evidence at all for a genetic
connection now, in 2006 and this was written in 1992

<p>
Gordie

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Gordie,
<p>
A couple of things have come up recently, but I think that in 1992 their
statement was guess-work,
and they were just assuming things, probably on the basis of the famous Swedish twins
studies. There, somebody found that both twins of a pair of orphaned twins
tended to become alcoholics if either
did, in spite of the twins being separated and raised in different families.
(Recently, I've heard that those studies were fatally flawed, but don't know the
details. I'll have to research that.)
<p>

What I've picked up on lately is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Alcoholism and some other addictions and compulsions have in
common the inability to achieve satisfaction from limited
quantities of a pleasure stimulus. This inability, &quot;reward
deficiency syndrome,&quot; is hard-wired into the brain and appears to
be linked to a genetic variation in the D2 receptor of chromosome 11.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">See
<i>Reward Deficiency Syndrome</i>, Kenneth Blum and others,
<b>The American Scientist</b>, March-April 1996.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And:<br> 
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;A Functional Neuropeptide Y Leu7Pro Polymorphism [is] Associated
With Alcohol Dependence in a Large Population Sample From the United
States&quot;.<br>
&quot;This is only the second specific
genetic mechanism ever identified that modulates risk for alcohol
dependence.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
See: <i>Arch Gen Psychiatry</i>. 2002;59:825-831;<br>
http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/issues/v59n9/toc.html (dead link)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice the careful wording: &quot;modulates the risk for alcohol dependence&quot;, not
&quot;causes alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
I like that. I agree. I don't think that the gene forces anybody to be an alcoholic; it
is simple an influence that loads the dice, and makes somebody more likely to become
an alcoholic. But we have a choice, and can override the genetic influence.
<p>
Something like eye color is totally genetically determined, and we don't
get any choice in the matter later on. Alcoholism isn't like that at all.

<p>
Have a good day.

Truth and reality are two different things;   truth is the way you
see it, and reality is the way it is.

Hi Louie,
<p>
Is that another attempt at
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">escape via relativism</a>?

&quot;Nobody sees the truth clearly, so let's not

<p>
I think that just like the A.A. slogan
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Some are sicker than others&quot;</font>,
we can say that
&quot;Some see the truth more clearly than others.&quot;
<p>
Those who will see the truth most clearly are those who really
want to see the truth, and are really
trying to see the truth, rather than just trying to avoid the truth
and cling to their old beliefs.

Dear Orange,

<p>

I was sent your website by a friend.

<p>

So much of it is completely false that I was astounded.

<p>

If you used to (or a close family member) go to AA and had a bad
experience, I'm sorry.  Unfortunately, sometimes that happens.

<p>

Hello Bridget,
<p>
I research very carefully. I believe that everything on my web site it true.
If you think that some fact or statement is in error, please tell me what it is.
Please give the page name, and the erroneous statement, and what you think the truth
is, and your sources of information. (Include book name, author, and page number, of course.)
Thank you.
<p>

Trying to explain away my objections to foisting quack medicine on sick people as
just having had a &quot;bad experience with A.A.&quot;
is another standard Alcoholics Anonymous dodge.
(It's called &quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>&quot;,
something that Bill Wilson said alcoholics were good at.)
<p>
I get that in letters from Steppers every so often.
Here is another recent letter that said the same thing:
<a href="orange-letters46.html#bad_experience">here</a>.
<p>
My belief that it is morally wrong, downright evil, to knowingly foist
ineffective quack medicine on sick people and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">then lie about how well it works</a>
is based on my basic ideas of right and wrong and how you should treat other
people, not on a &quot;bad experience&quot;.

Yeah I guess my point was that if one really wants too and one really
has too get off the alcohol and other drugs, then one gets off them.

<p>

Groveling at 2 sticks on the wall, while in some sense, may provide a
nice cosy bias to ones belief system &#8212; a sort of positive spin in a cess
pit of habitually negative thinking, doing so does not actually make one
stop. Self (me, myself and I) &#8212; we have to do it.

<p>

There is millions of people who grovel at two sticks on the wall, and
they still drop dead of every thing... the groveling doesn't work.

<p>

I have heard the phrase &quot;Bill Wilsons quack medicine / faith healing&quot;.

<p>

And while I do believe that some lying can be useful, to tell people
that they are not fucked, that they can make it, because if we can make
it, you make it too; that can inspire some hope, in some one who feels
utterly hopeless; however when it's coupled with ongoing systemic lies,
abuse and neglect &#8212; to achieve in effect the suspension of reality and
fairly valid insights and observations, then it's utterly evil.

<p>

So to be told (or positively manipulated) that &quot;You can get off the
alcohol and other drugs, we did it and this is how &#8212; you have a bright
and wonderful future ahead of you &#8212; everything is going to be rosy&quot; &#8212;
can really help... you can actually GIVE people some hope.

<p>

A sort of &quot;pat on the head, an ice cream and to be told they are loved
and wanted; and that we can overcome this, we will even help you to help
yourself &#8212; please come back&quot; &#8212; is a very good thing, to the person
drowning in the despair of their own belief systems.

<p>

But when it's coupled with the rest of the AA program, which after my 30
years in it, from the age of 12 onwards, qualifies me as having an
opinion based upon experience, then it's the most fundamental bit of
manipulation and mind fuck imposition that one can be subject too.

<p>

I am reminded of my own childhood, where I was so fucked up from all the
incest etc., that at 14 I was a sitting duck for a serial pedophile who
used the same technique that AA does to recruit new members.

<p>

He promised to look after me, but under his terms and his conditions for
his own ends, at my expense.

<p>

He essentially lied to me, by promising to act as a defacto or
substitute father, and yet having manipulated me in dropping what ever
defences I had left, he then exploited me.

<p>

This is exactly the same way that Alcoholics Anonymous works.

<p>

And it was founded by two scam artists &#8212; who since I was not a part of
Bill Wilsons life, I was never with him from birth 24/7, side by side
like a siamese twin, or some free floating spirit hovering over him, I
cannot say what went on in his life with absolute authority on the
subject; however I am told that there is a very good chance that he was
subjected to much sexual and emotional abuse, as well as coming from a
pretty crazy family.

<p>

However, what we experience we learn from and it's completely realistic
to recyle abuse both onto one's self and others, in a myriad of ways.

<p>

How a serial pedophile works, is exactly the same way that the program
of AA works; it's the same techniques &#8212; played out in a different way.

<p>

It's pure manipulation.

<p>

One of my major points of irritation with AA and it's brainwashed
members, is how the &quot;Singleness of Purpose Statement&quot; gets read out at
meetings and conventions....

<p>

e.g.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731125256/http://www.aaprimarypurpose.org/SinglePurpose.htm">
http://www.aaprimarypurpose.org/SinglePurpose.htm</a>

<p>

The whole thing is bullshit, Bill Wilson on account of all the groups
having a million and one rules for membership, said we got to include
everyone who wants to stop drinking; yet the &quot;singleness of purpose&quot;
agenda is pushed to keep AA only for alcoholics and to tell people to
confine their discussion (sharing) only to problems with alcohol (and
not other issues, such as sex, other drugs gambling, food, gossip, diet,
exercise, relationships blah blah blah etc).

<p>

And yet, a real lot of people who want to stop drinking, weather they
are fortunate enough to escape or avoid the clutches of AA, all need
varying degrees of help with living skills and self care &#8212; so they can
live well and care for others &#8212; and have functional relationships.

<p>

Yet the party line toting AA nazis &#8212; through shaming, manipulation and
control, try to make other people whittle the stories of their own lives
from the start, to the great fall and ascending to earthly heaven in
recovery, down to &quot;I drank, I got drunk, I fell over, I came to AA, and
thanks to god and Alcoholics Anonymous I am sober today, please put more
money in the basket &#8212; and keep spouting the party line&quot;.

<p>

Yet in 30 years of time around mostly AA and NA (and some 15 other
fellowships) it's been my own personal experience that almost everyone
does drugs other than alcohol, and their whole lives are in summary &#8212;
just fucked up everything. Fucked up self care, fucked up eating, fucked
up exercise, fucked up businesses, fucked up relationships, fucked up
parenting &#8212; everything.

<p>

So for the AA nazis to be spouting &quot;The singleness of purpose&quot;
statement, the suggestion that must be obeyed... well not only are they
just fucking arseholes using lower grade standover merchant antics and
the threat of non-conformity with the group and fellowship, these stupid
cunts who spout the party line, miss the point entirely that &quot;recovery&quot;
is about &quot;living as a whole and well person in every area of their
lives&quot; and it's got fuck all to do with having a good AA drinking story.

<p>

The most useful things I ever got from AA was being told, &quot;That just for
to day, you don't have to drink&quot;, someone gave me permission to change.

<p>

The other main thing I found that was immensely useful in AA was to
undertake the process of daily inventory. Self examination at depth &#8212;
and to eventually give the flick to most of the stupid fuck AA sponsors
&#8212; who were basically gossips running on hidden adgendas; and to share
these issues with competant therapists &#8212; who could help me to help
myself &#8212; is an overall good thing.

<p>

Inventory in a nutshell is the recording the process of examination in
detail and then making revisions to either improve or cease lowering the
bench mark.

<p>

You do it in cooking, business, accounting, repairs, the laundry....
everything, but it's the process of applying it to ones self, ones
personality and ones motives and ones undertakings.

<p>

The car runs really well, why does it run really well?<br>
The car runs like shit, why does it run like shit?

<p>

The laundry is clean and and fresh, why is it really clean and fresh?<br>
The laundry is grubby and unclean, why is it grubby and unclean?

<p>

The food is great or the food is shit? Why, how did it get that way? Can
it be improved? What do you need to do to correct it?

<p>

This is the same fundamental process we need to apply to ourselves and
our lives.

<p>

As far as giving the well deserved flick to all the AA sponsors, some of
the most useful people I have ever come across are my friends &#8212; outside
of AA.

<p>

They have a fun tendency to be blunt and to the point.

<p>

I kind of divide life and people and their attitudes up into 2 polarised
opposites.

<p>

One is either making ones self a better and healthier person or one is not.

<p>

Life is like being able to swim well. Choosing to learn how to do it
well is a good thing, but if you can't, choosing to not go out in to the
surf, is a good decision as well.

<p>

If you don't currently have many happy or good relationships, at least
don't go hang out with the crazies and losers.

<p>

But in the meantime, go get lessons on how to live well within and with
yourself and hence to go on and to lead a full, happy and productive
life &#8212; away from AA; and the people in it &#8212; which is basically
everything that AA and it's party line fundamentalists don't do.

<p>

Some people in AA said &quot;You don't have to drink again, if you don't want
too&quot; &#8212; and really that was about as far as AA goes in being of any use
to anyone.

<p>

But I needed LOTS of help... and for me, Anthony Robbins and his &quot;Get
the Edge&quot; progam has been one of the most useful things I have ever
applied to my own life in great detail.

<p>

He doesn't have &quot;the patent&quot; on fundamental truths, he willing admits
that alot of his material, is what he has picked up from other people,
who have practiced a range of attitudes, outlooks, expections and
efforts, to make themselves into happy, well adjusted and productive people.

<p>

There is a lot of really good self help stuff around &#8212; that is
everything that AA isn't and can't be or do.

<p>

AA is just a nasty little cult...

<p>

Since I don't need or want shit like that in my life, being the AA
program of recovery, a good drinking story to keep the arseholes happy
cause I am giving them the impression that I am as just into denial
about my entire life as what they are... and that I too am exploitable
and an exploiter, well I have long since moved on from that shit...

<p>

I don't think that drinking again would be a particularly wise move for
me... nor would taking anything else,  so what?

<p>

There is a lot of really good therapists and self help programs and
groups and life skills things to get into.

<p>

Learn how to swim well.... go and have a great time in the surf... enjoy
yourself and your life.

<p>

Be Well &#8212; Live Well

From:  	&quot;BLOOZMAN&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: cults<br>

<p>

Orange,
<p>
Another thought occurred to me. When you're defining alcoholics by
having all those negative traits on
<a href="orange-letters36.html#TSARI">the TSARI indicator</a>
what you're
really doing is defining nonalcoholics. Does that mean nonalcoholics are
perfect and never have faults or negative traits? So nonalcoholics are
never criminals? never pontificate? never charming? never think the
rules don't apply to them? (probably almost everyone breaks the rules
sometime in their life.)
<p>
So logically either 1. nonalcoholics sometimes
have these traits too which blows the whole theory out of the water
because then anyone can be an alcoholic. or 2. nonalcoholics never have
these traits which is even scarier because that's saying that alcoholics
are an inferior &quot;race&quot; to nonalcoholics. So he could be defined as a
nonalcoholic supremest.
<p>
Maybe we need a little ethnic cleansing to rid
our society of these inferior drunks. So where are these people that
have no negative traits and never cheat? I've never met one have you?
<p>
Isn't it cheating by the way to sit in AA meetings fraudulently? Also
it's strange to me the mix of positive and negative traits on the list.
Isn't pontificating a good thing? Isn't being charming good? That
mixture of good and bad makes the theory even more bizarre and hard to
follow doesn't it.
<p>
Another point is I think people are more likely to
exhibit those traits when drunk whether alcoholic or not (such as
pontificating, breaking the rules, being charming etc) so that shows
that he's defining alcoholism as being drunk. That's like saying a food
addict is a person who eats.
<p>
So whenever you're drunk you can be defined
as an alcoholic but we all know that its a person who is chronically
drunk not just drunk who is alcoholic. So doesn't that mean that the
Thorburn theory is basically meaningless and puerile?

From:  	&quot;Mr. Wolf&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Thanks for the freedom<br>

<p>
From The Wolf in the UK:

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I could write you a very, very long E Mail and one day I will, but I
just want to let you know the following. I came across your website in
March after fifteen years as a real AA True Believer. I have been deeply
depressed for almost my entire sobriety and made poor decisions in every
area of my life. What was the solution I was offered, &quot;Keep coming back.
It gets better.&quot; Needless to say, it did not and by this March I was
verging on the suicidal, not for the first time.

<p>
In my time in AA I have either experienced myself, or heard first hand
testimony of, being financially ripped off, threatened and suffering
emotional manipulation and sexual abuse. Many, probably most, AAs are
well-intentioned people doing the best with the crud they are offered
but there are some truly sick and even dangerous people hiding in &quot;the
rooms&quot; as well. I worked out even when I was still a deacon that many
so-called members are not alcoholic while many of those who are have no
interest in getting well, but do like a social club where they get to
dump their toxic crap. In the end I realized that I was sober <b>despite
AA and not because of it</b>.

<p>
One day somebody is going to sue AA for the harm done to themselves or a
loved one. What will happen when the outside world realizes that AA
holds weekly meetings with no list of who has attended and no minutes of
what was said? Why do so many families accept their loved ones going to
AA and then dying, as I saw time and time again?

<p>
Sadly, AA's propaganda is so good that, when I told friends and family
that I had had enough and was not going to meetings any more, they were
worried. Suffice to say that now they see the change for the better in
me, they are delighted, and back my decision.

<p>
I know a lot of your angry, aggressive correspondents who lead such a
spiritual life in the Fellowship accuse you of knowing nothing about AA,
despite your experience which anyone can read in your introduction.
Well, after over fifteen years, which included service at group level,
sponsoring people and a lot of meetings, certainly well over a thousand,
I am qualified to say that your criticisms of AA are entirely accurate
and it is urgent that the wider public become aware of them.

<p>
In my last ever meeting, someone whom I had never seen before walked in
late and confessed that he had been compulsively masturbating and paying
for sex. The craziness of such &quot;sharing&quot; to a room of strangers finally
hit me in all its bizarreness. I was not first in the queue to hold his
hand when we said the Serenity Prayer. What really scared me was my AA
auto-pilot which led me to take him into a side room and invite him to
get on his knees to pray with me for him to be released from his
compulsion. I felt a complete phoney and an idiot. Sorry AA, I have a
wife and two small kids now; I just do not need dangerously unstable
people in my life any more. I have been hurt enough

<p>
Is it any surprise that, as Bill writes in the 12&amp;12, when some early
AAs went to Europe to fight in WW2 and were away from meetings, more of
them stayed sober than the ones who stayed at home? Bill let that slip
through the propaganda net, didn't he?

<p>
The first person to benefit from my leaving AA was my wife. She actually
gets me at home in the evenings when she needs me and I no longer sit
around &quot;with the phone stuck to my face&quot;, as she once said, when she is
getting on with what needs doing. More importantly, I no longer look
down on her as a &quot;civilian&quot; who &quot;does not have a programme&quot;. My former
arrogance was sickening.

<p>
I can't ever get back the fifteen years I lost in AA, and I can't
imagine how much more I might have made for my life if I had not been
filled with guilt and shame by the steps and spent countless hours of my
life in meetings, denying my intelligence and abilities, and desperately
bored, instead of out playing music or sport or building relationships
with workmates. I have to make the most of what is left of life, which,
fortunately, is a lot, as I came to AA young.

<p>
You are a good man doing an important job. I needed the validation to
overcome my cult-implanted phobias in order for me to break with AA, and
you provided it. We will never meet, but you have helped me to change my
life. Thank you.

<p>
I am not using my own name as I am still scared of the person who ripped
me off.

<p>
Wolf.

Date:  	Fri, May 12, 2006 22:55<br>
From:  	dan<br>
Subject:  	Thanks for your website<br>

<p>

Just a quick thanks for all the work that you have put into this
website, and to let you know that it really helped me to come across
it.  After 8 months of having locked my doubts and reasoning mind in the
closet and being an AA poster child (2-3 meetings a day, 6 commitments,
daily check-ins with my sponsor), I was at the point where I could no
long close my eyes or my mind to the feeling that there was something
terribly wrong with this belief system that encouraged dishonesty and
stuffing feelings and that was devised by a man that I wouldn't want to
have dinner with, much less pattern my life after.  I also couldn't
shake the feeling that the longer people stayed in AA, the less their
lives seemed to offer.  They seemed less genuine and &quot;human&quot; than the
people, like me, that were new.  It all seemed creepy to me, for lack of
a better term.

<p>

The problem was, I had been led to believe that there were no
alternatives... that it was either AA or death/insanity for me and anyone
else who struggled with alcohol.  Talk about hitting bottom!!!  Finally
I came to the point where I realized that, if my ONLY choices were AA or
hopeless alcoholism, I knew I'd rather die an honest drunk than live
some kind of tortured lie in order to stay sober.  Faced with this
choice, I was ready to go out and have a binge because I thought that
was the only alternative to the AA zombie &quot;way of life&quot;.

<p>

About that time, I came across your website, along with SMART materials,
and I started to realize that I didn't have to make that choice.... that
I could live just fine without alcohol and NOT sell my soul to AA.

<p>

I still go to some meetings (not the 2-3 a day that I went to for 6
months) because there are some good people there who are in the same
boat I am.  But I don't subscribe to the crap that constitutes most of
the meetings, and I am also exploring other support alternatives.

<p>

AA has some good points, which you've already covered in your website.
But ANY organization has it's good points.  The test is the overall
result.  If it helps other people not drink, fine.... I can't make
judgments about their lives... but it just seems like a dishonest and
pernicious belief system, and it almost drove me back to booze.

<p>

Keep up the good work.

<p>

Dan

Orange,

<p>

Thanks for all your help &#8212; it is much appreciated. I liked
<a href="orange-letters45.html#James_G2">your reasons
for not replying due to the nice weather</a>
&#8212; it is so refreshing to hear
of someone who is able to enjoy themselves without feeling guilty and
why the hell not? Enjoy the sun!

<p>

I had a tough letter from a friend in AA who I respect. I do not respect
his views but he is a good man and means well but he is caught up in all
this as well but he is more open-minded than most. I am new to all this
and as such I am not sure I used the right arguements or facts. Please
let me know and feel free to post it on your site. To see the letter go

<p>

I really hope the UK is able to catch on to the truth like the US has
with your site &#8212; that is my main objective with all this.

<p>

Hoping for more sun your way...

PS I am soon to release the video Confession Session Part 2 &#8212; will keep
you posted. Adding links  on the Orange Papers to my site have really
helped both the site (and thus the cause) and my beleif in myself and my
thoughts. Sometimes I feel like I might be wrong but hearing from other
people who feel the way we do really does a lot to reverse that damned
step 2. Did you doubt yourself fleetingly at times when you first
started out? I never doubt myself totally, but at times I ponder and AA
dogma comes back for a moment but I KNOW it is not right.

Hi James,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. As you probably already guessed from this slow
answer, I've been enjoying the sun again. And the company of a bunch of little people:

They are pretty tame. Some of the goslings will

and curl up and go to sleep at my feet.
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Taking your last question first, of course I have doubted myself at times.
Many times, I would have to double-check the situation to make sure I wasn't
going off on a tangent, or being too crazy.
I think that is actually a sign of sanity. A sane, realistic person pauses
and does a reality check every so often. A narcissist with delusions of grandeur doesn't.
(Does that sound familiar? Can you say 'Bill W.'?
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#miracles_of_mental_health">We, who have
recovered from serious drinking, are miracles of mental health.</a>&quot;)
<p>
About your letter on Blamedenial &#8212;
<ul>
<li>
You did a good job of arguing a lot of points.
I think that the guy with whom you were debating is unlikely to change his opinions
about the things you discussed. Once someone becomes convinced of the rightness of the
A.A. program &#8212; and convinced of such strange irrational beliefs as that &quot;sharing&quot;
in A.A. meetings with a bunch of &quot;untreated lunatics&quot; cures (or arrests) alcoholism &#8212;
they tend to stay that way, at least for a long time.
So don't be disappointed if nothing changes.
<p>
The people who say in letters to me that I changed their minds about things
also often mention the fact that they were wondering about things for a while before
they stumbled across my web site, and then something that I wrote made things clear for them.
Such people had actually already changed their minds before they ever got to my web site;
they just didn't know it yet. Reading something that I said merely crystalized something
that they were thinking but had not quite put into words yet.
<p>
Those people were willing to change their minds. In fact, they already had.
On the other hand, the people who write to tell me that I'm all wrong and don't understand
A.A. at all are quite unwilling to even think that A.A. might be less than wonderful.
I don't think I've changed the minds of very many of them at all.
<a href="orange-letters45.html#coming_around">I only know of one</a>, ever.
One guy wrote to say that he had debated with me a few years earlier, and then gradually came
to agree with me. Otherwise, forget it. Not gonna happen.

<p>
So when I carry on those debates with the true believers, I don't expect them to change
their minds. I do it for the benefit of the other people, the innocent bystanders
who are watching the show.
They can read the whole debate, both sides, and learn from it.
(Hence there is no point in carrying on private email debates, so I don't do that.)

<p>
<li>
This line really stood out &#8212; after your
correspondent listed a whole bunch of mental illnesses, he wrote:<br>

<font color="#4f007f"><i>
The illness of Alcoholism includes all of the above to a greater degree than in the average person.
</i></font>
<p>
Ummm, I'd like to know where he gets that. I've read a lot of things about alcoholism,
and never saw any doctor or psychiatrist claim that alcoholism was a catch-all of other
mental illnesses. In fact, the bible of psychiatrists in the USA &#8212;
<i>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> &#8212;
doesn't even list &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a mental illness or disease
at all. That is quite deliberate, not an oversight.

They list &quot;alcohol abuse&quot; and &quot;alcohol dependency&quot;,
but there is no &quot;alcoholism&quot;. See the actual page
<a href="orange-DSM-IV-195.png">here</a>

<p>
Now I agree that people who are compulsively drinking themselves to death usually have
some underlying mental illness, but that sure doesn't mean that
&quot;alcoholism includes all of the above&quot; mental disorders.
It doesn't even mean that there is any such disease as &quot;alcoholism&quot;.

<p>
That leads us right into the next item: The American Medical Association:

<p>
<li>
You asked about the AMA recognizing &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a disease.
Actually they did, but watch out. That is a loaded statement. There are all kinds of
gotchas and complications. The first big problem with that is that the
American Medical Association is not actually the final or official
authority on medical issues, not at all.
In fact, it is just a private club for some doctors.
About half of the doctors in the USA are members. Other doctors are strongly
opposed to what it does.
<p>
The AMA has a very sordid history.
Morris Fishbein, the guy who built the AMA up into the empire
that it is, was convicted of racketeering for
practicing extortion on the pharmaceutical companies and forcing them to buy expensive
full-page advertisements in his JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association),
or else he wouldn't let the AMA recommend their medicines.
<p>
The AMA decision to recognize &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a
&quot;disease&quot; was a political decision,
not a medical decision.
They were just mollifying some noisy Steppers who wanted alcoholism declared to be
a disease.
What was most outrageous is that the AMA didn't bother
to actually define the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;
themselves. They let a joint committee of two A.A.
front groups write the definition for them.
So of course the definition is very strange. It doesn't even say that alcoholism
is caused by drinking alcohol.
Hence the AMA has zero credibility on the subject of alcoholism.

<p>
See the whole gory story <a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA">here</a>.

Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Banana&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Blaming the Victim<br>

<p>

Hey Orange:

<p>

Thanks for your site. I find it rather cathardic after six years in AA.
Prior to attending AA, I consider myself fortunate that I had the
ability and desire to read most of the derogatory information available
at that time.  I believed it all
and think that to a great extent it's how I stayed true to myself in
AA.
<p>
Why did I stay, was I helped or was I harmed.... I think I'll
grapple with those questions for quite some time. I'm more sure of why I
left. It took just about a year, I know the beginning date and I know
the ending day. But this isn't about me, I'm one of the more fortunate
ones in AA ... I lived. Presently I'm more concerned about the ones who
die.  I'm outraged and heartbroken.

<p>

I can only repeat what we've all heard before... AA isn't about helping
the sick and suffering.
AA is about AA and it can callously sloganize
people virtually to death!  What I've seen in six years is the same
recidivism of 95% or more, with the mixed bag of placebo effect,
religiosity and whatever that we all see, plus the heartbreaking person
that comes in and out of AA for an entire life time believing they are
at fault, being told that they are at fault, when anyone with half a
brain should see that AA doesn't work for them, it never has worked for
them, if they try to work what has never worked for them, they will just
die!  It's like the Law of Diminishing Returns.

<p>

I left AA because I could not be sure that I would not be above
violence if I heard one more person blast any of these people with &quot;You
are powerless over alcohol&quot; or
&quot;You need to surrender completely to this program&quot;, in a droll voice.  I
was just becoming more and more angry with the more I saw... the real AA.

<p>

I'm outraged at what I have seen in six years.  After six years, the
discomfort I felt when the steps and literature was read has never
changed.  Did that damage me? Probably not, only to the extent that it
is probably unwise to be pissed off so much!

<p>

Does it damage some people desperate enough to think that to be sober
they must believe that they are actually worse people than they think
they are and that is the only way to get sober!  AA is an extremely
abusive and exploitive organization.  Sound therapeutic practices build
on peoples' strengths not their seven deadly sins! Of course AA damages
people or at the very minimum slows what they call recovery.

Hey Orange:

<p>

After six years in AA, now I have parted, and your site has been a
blast!  I always said that &quot;Peanuts&quot; was my higher power, but I'm having
so much fun (in between resentments about AA), your site is a close tie!

<p>

Did you miss this goodie on sponsorship:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

&quot;during the &quot;Treatment Center Boom&quot;... AA's membership increased
dramatically... This would at first glance seem to be a good thing.
However... large numbers of newcomers were showing up who were physically
recovered and feeling good about themselves..... Most arrived far less
teachable than they ever had in the past.&quot;<br>
</font>

http://www.waxahachieaa.org/info/sponsorship.htm</a>
</blockquote>

<p>

So... all that cramming in college... those all nighters... strung out on
coffee and cigarettes was the way to go afterall... I was more teachable
when I was run down and wrung out.  I just knew it all along!

<p>

Fortunately, I never had a sponsor, never prayed... excepting my serenity
prayer &quot;Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me&quot; (works for
me), never did 'the steps', but frequently quoted my own:

<p>

1.    Can't drink.<br>
2.    People need other people.<br>
3.    Don't beat a dead horse.<br>
4.    Look in the mirror.<br>
5.    Get real.<br>
6.    Build on my strengths.<br>
7.    Practice being the person I want to be.<br>
9.    Clear out negativity in relationships.<br>
11.    Pet the kitty.  (really, that was always a hit)<br>
12.    Live gracefully in a world of give and take.<br>

<p>

Still quite sad about the harm that I've seen done to people. Some
instances still fill me with bitterness. I stopped going for many
reasons, but the ugliest remains the hardest to shake.  A friend of mine
went to a meeting expecting to find me.  She was heavily intoxicated,
hysterical and verbally abusive.  She's a feisty gal, but harmless. She
was all but begging for someone to get in touch with me.  It was a small
meeting, usually less than 20 people attend, every body knows
everybody.  I'd say that at least 4 people knew how to get in touch with
me.  That didn't happen, instead someone called the police and when she
exited the building she was greeted by two policemen holding shotguns at
her.  Although she had another (sober) friend in a car waiting for her,
she was handcuffed behind her back and taken into protective custody.
Protective custody... fancy term for absolute humiliation and degradation,
not to mention outright abuse considering the circumstances. During
processing she needed to vomit, but with her hands chained behind her
she lost her balance and fell face first on the floor.  I could go on
but it just gets uglier... their excuses are even more despicable.

<p>

I want nothing to do with any of these people who help the still sick
and suffering!  I just don't have the stomach for it anymore.

<p>

I've rambled enough but I do have a question.  I've read a lot about
AAWS and their cutesy little prudent reserve.  Do you know if they are a
tax exempt organization and a non-profit... don't laugh.  I'm curious
about accessibility to records. Love that stuff, formerly I was a state
tax auditor. If you ever get this... I'd really appreciate a quick
answer, if you know anything.

<p>

Thanks for your good work.

Hi Bananas,
<p>
Thanks for the letters and the stories, and congratulations on your
newfound freedom.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is actually two corporations &#8212; one a for-profit publishing
house, and one a non-profit service organization, which owns all of the stock
of the first one.
They are Alcoholics Anonymous [World] Services, Incorporated, and the General
Service Organization, respectively.<br>
[The publishing house AAWS dropped the &quot;World&quot; word from their name a couple
of years ago. Still, you will see a zillion old references to &quot;AAWS&quot;, like on
the copyright page of the <i>Big Book</i>.]

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
[UPDATE: They reincorporated AAWS as a non-profit corporation. Now they don't have to pay taxes on their income
from book sales.]
</font>
<p>
Because the GSO is a tax-exempt non-profit, they have to file publicly-accessible
financial documents. I've never done it, but somebody on the Internet has looked
up those things, and found interesting information like that the members of
the AAWS Board of Trustees make over $70,000 per year each (and there are 15 of them),
and the President of AAWS gets about $125,000 per year.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<p>
One of these days, when I get around to it, I'll have to figure out how to
get access to those documents. If you do it first, please let me know how to do it,
and you might pass on anything interesting that you get.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

I am curious as to whether or not you are an alcoholic and, if so, are
you in recovery?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Howard,
<p>
The answer is &quot;yes&quot; on both questions.
Read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction, here</a>.

<p>
But watch out on that word &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters15.html#alcoholic_definitions_2">See this discussion</a>

</font>
<p>

I just discovered your site today and although it seems to be nothing
more than a dump site for what appear to be resentments toward the
Fellowship and anger fueled attacks on any and all books or publications
that in any way condone and/or endorse Alcoholics Anonymous, perhaps I
have missed something.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well actually, there is a lot more here than just &quot;resentments&quot;.

I've been sober, through AA, for thirteen and a half years.  This after
30 years of hard core alcohol and drug abuse which destroyed everything
of value in my life.  So I'm rather sold on AA you see.

Congratulations on your new clean and sober lifestyle. It is good that you finally quit
killing yourself with drugs and alcohol. Fortunately, a lot of us do wise up eventually, don't we?

I chose to walk away from AA a month ago and boy the members are beating
on my door.  I was a poster child for a solid AA member, regular
meetings, several sponsees, etc.  Anyhow I had been looking for more
out of life the past few years, and the AA tapes in my head would only
limit me.  A month ago I hooked up with a therapist and he is helping me
to extricate myself from this Cult.  My feelings come and go on the
matter.  Reading your site helped a lot.  The biggest challenge is other
members who don't or won't understand and are trying to save me from
myself.  Any words or links you may have are appreciated.  Thanks for
the good work.  The truth will set you free!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your newfound freedom.
And thanks for the compliments.
<p>
Alas, those members who are trying to &quot;save you from yourself&quot; are almost certain
to continue to think the way that they think. The odds of you teaching them something
are pretty low.

<p>
That is just a basic problem with human nature. People don't like to admit that they have
been wrong, or foolish, or stupid. To admit that you are right and A.A. is wrong
would require them to make huge admissions of being wrong about a lot of things.
They have a big emotional investment in A.A., and don't want to lose their investment.
And they don't seem to have any desire to change their lives.
So they will continue to insist that you are wrong, and they are right, and they
will see you as a lost sheep.
<p>
<a name="social_circle"> </a>
The only answer to that is to find a new social circle. I know that's
a hassle, and not easy. I don't know what is available in your city,
but I would check out everything that is clean and sober, from church
socials to bingo parties to dry dances to classical concerts, or whatever.
<p>
You could also try online chat groups for some easy quick companionship.

Subject:  	The &quot;Addictiveness&quot; Of Tobacco<br>

<p>

Regarding the &quot;addictiveness&quot; of tobacco I can happily state that
it's a lie. If one believes it to be impossible to quit then it will
be hard to quit. But what about us quitters who succeeded?

<p>
I have over a decade of being nicotine-free. And, in regards to my
other addictions, it was that self-recovery which added some insight
into the falsehoods of the &quot;most addictive&quot; substance hype. In fact
I've found that the so-called experts don't know jack about
self-recovery.

<p>
The big skinny is here on how I quit smoking and the numerous
insights afterwards:

<p>
Your site is still awesome and a first-stop reference source for me
against the pro-addiction cult known as A.A.

<p>
Peace! :-)

Hi Dr. Bomb,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the compliments. And I like your web site too.
<p>
Alas, this nicotine issue is one of those things about which
we are really going to disagree.
<p>
I was addicted to cigarettes and nicotine for about 30 years, and I can tell you
that nicotine gets into your brain and affects your mind on a very deep level
and in a very strange way. I wanted to quit smoking for just about the entire 30 years,
and now that I finally have 5 years off of cigarettes, for the first time
in my adult life, I am rejoicing. And I am absolutely determined to never go back
to that hell again.

<p>
The nicotine addiction is bizarre:
One time, I quit smoking for a whole year just by saying, &quot;I need
all of my energy for this trip&quot;.
I threw my pack of cigarettes into the fire, and packed my wife and kids into my jeep and
drove to another state and a new life, and I don't even recall any
withdrawal. That was it, just like that.
<p>
But then, more than a year later, when I returned to the first state,
a wave of nostalgia hit me, and the
thinking was, &quot;Oh, let's have one with the guys for old time's
sake...&quot; and I was instantly readdicted and smoked for years more.

<p>
But many, many other times, when I tried to quit,
I was crawling the walls for a cigarette
and finally just went so insane that I smoked just to stop the insanity.
<p>
And then the mind games are the worst of it: After successfully quitting
and detoxing, the warped thinking starts and nags at you &#8212;
&quot;Oh, we can have one now, just one, because we've
got it under control now. We've got a handle on it. Just one will be
okay.&quot;
<p>
No, one won't be okay. Just one was always instant readdiction, and
then I'd usually have to smoke for another couple of years to get sick
enough again to have the will power and determination to quit again.
<p>
I think that the mind games are worse than the physical withdrawal.
I did a whole web page on that warped thinking,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">here</a>.
<p>
It's a very strange thing, nicotine addiction.
<p>
I've even known three different ex-junkies who all managed to
quit heroin by just quitting cold turkey and detoxing themselves.
And they really were off of heroin.
But all three of them still smoked.
One of them said, &quot;Oh heck, quitting heroin wasn't that bad. I just laid in
bed and sweated and shook for three days and it was over. But I can't quit
these things.&quot; And he had a cigarette in one hand, and a beer in the other.
<p>
I don't think that it is just a coincidence or accident that most of the people in
Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings still smoke tobacco.
They all &quot;share&quot; their stories about how wonderful it is to
be &quot;in recovery&quot; and off of drugs and alcohol, and then they
all run for the door at smoke break time, and immediately light up.
(And if you are so uncool as to mention the fact that nicotine is also a
bad drug, you get a lot of denials and rationalizations and dirty looks... :-))

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

[another letter from ARIDsite:]



Date:  	Tue, June 6, 2006 17:23<br>
From:  	&quot;ARID Site&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: The &quot;Addictiveness&quot; Of Tobacco<br>

<p>


Thanks for the very thorough reply. I'm certainly not minimizing your
experience with nicotine. Far from it. Even I &quot;relapsed&quot; on nicotine
only once in that decade and yet, in my case, it wasn't so much as a
kiss of death but a kiss goodbye. Instead of a taste of satisfaction
it just tasted icky and, morally, just felt all wrong. Thus ended my
addiction to nicotine once and for all via two final coughin'nails.

<p>

The irony is that I lit back up in A.A. meetings. No one forced me
to, mind you. I did that all by myself.

<p>

And, if you must know, that pack of more-than-half a
pack'o'coughin'nails is still in my locker at work (give or take a
couple since I gave a couple away for those who were jonsein' for
some pollution years ago). I wonder how &quot;chewy&quot; those cancer sticks
are by now since they're now buried in the back somewhere (maybe
soaking in a puddle of long-forgotten hot sauce for all I know). ;-&gt;

<p>

Finally, I have nothing against drugs. In fact I see drugs as neither
good nor bad. So while you may call nicotine &quot;bad&quot;, I don't. In fact
I don't mind if the Buchmanites light'em'up after their little cult
gatherings. It only proves that those so-called &quot;experts&quot; don't know
shit about addiction and are NOT to be trusted.

<p>

&quot;Yeah.&quot; {puff} &quot;We're the REAL experts on addiction.&quot; &gt;COUGH!&lt;
&gt;HACK!&lt; &gt;WHEEZE!&lt; &quot;Need me as a sponsor? I haven't drank in a few
years.&quot; {puff} &quot;Damn...I need to save that dollar for my next pack.
Pony up two dollars for you're here to learn from us.&quot; &gt;CHOKE!&lt;
&gt;HOCK!&lt; &gt;PTUI!&lt;

<p>

They're free to smoke just as I have the freedom of speech. When they
leave after saying their &quot;Our Father&quot; to smoke their sickarettes I
call 'em a bunch of world-class hypocrites. Or maybe they are truly
being one with their mentor who died of emphysema.

<p>

Maybe they're really on &quot;The Path&quot; after all! ;-&gt;
