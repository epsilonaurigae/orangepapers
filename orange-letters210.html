Dear Orange

<p>
Thanks to your website I have now celebrated my 3 month anniversary of
leaving AA.

<p>
I just got the following text from my ex-sponsor:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;On Dec 11th 1934 Bill W had his last drink. At 2.30pm he was admitted
to Towns Hospital. Ebby visited him again and told him what he had done.
Bill had the &quot;white flash&quot; and on Dec 18th he left Towns, headed down to
Sam Shoemaker's Mission to help others and the work goes on. We trudge
the Road, Happy Destiny, may God bless our path.&quot;

I couldn't resist replying with:

Hi,

<p>
I would like to express my deepest appreciation for your site and I just
love what you're doing to inform and let people know the truths about AA and
12-step programs. In the future I would like to do something similar and
have a Swedish site on this so I'm asking whether you see any chance for me
to use some of your material or if I can refer to it as sources of
reference. Again I think you've done quite a marvelous job in gathering all
this information and there would be no need to have another site on this if
it wasn't for the reason that I think having a Swedish translation would be
beneficial as many Swedes are not comfortable with studying in English.
Swedes are very good at English in general but I think that a lot of people
with problems with abuse and addiction lacks the scholastic levels needed
sometimes to study complex matters and facts in English.

<p>
All the best

Subject:  	Please consider<br>

<p>
When you say that people &quot;Drop out&quot; of AA or that it has a failure rate of 95% &#8212; 
%100, are you accounting for people who come back&quot; For example, it would seem to me
that just because somebody celebrates a 2-year chip and not a 3-year chip did not
necessarily &quot;Drop out&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot;, but that they simply may have had one drink or a
binge only to willingly come back to AA.

<p>
My point being, 95% &#8212; %100 percent, as well as your method of counting chips of
certain lengths of sobriety is inaccurate.

<p>
Somebody could be in AA for over 10 years, drink only 5 times during that whole 10
years while remaining in AA, but only pick up a 2 year chip at the most.

<p>
Following this series of events, one person could picked up 24 hour, 30 day, 60 day,
90 day, 6 month, 9 month, 1 year, 18 month and 2 year chips 5 times. That's 45 chips
given out to the same person without that person ever receiving anything greater
than a 3 year chip.

<p>
Yet if that person is still in AA and IS HAPPY ? then they did not fail once at AA
and have alone accounted for 44 of your other failures over the course of 10 years.

<p>
Ultimately, success in AA is measured in how happy a member is. If a member is not
happy in AA, they are free to leave and proclaim AA a failure for themselves.
Whether AA has failed for others, regardless of whether they've drank or not, is up
to them.

<p>
It sounds like AA did not work for you, which is fine. I truly hope you have stayed
sober and it sounds like you have. Congratulations. But perhaps you should formulate
a better measure for success than just the chips that are handed out at meetings.
Sometimes it takes 5 years just to get that 1 year chip.

Hello Josh,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. 
<p>
I clearly said that such calculations
were not scientific or 100% reliable. And we have errors on both ends, but they tend to cancel
each other out:<br>
At the start, there are people who pick up several first-day &quot;Just For Today&quot; coins.
And at the other end, we have people who are so proud of themselves for making it for 10 or 20 years
that they are driving all over town, from one meeting to another, and picking up a coin at each
meeting so that they can hear the crowd cheering for them again and again.
<p>
Nevertheless, the sales figures for those coins still reveal an enormous drop-out rate.

<p>
Then, this is the key sentence in your letter:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Yet if that person is still in AA and IS HAPPY ?

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is a very nasty two-lettered word in that sentence: &quot;IF&quot;.

<p>
When we examine the facts, like properly-done medical tests,
 we see that there are a lot of people in A.A. who are not very
happy, because A.A. has been clearly shown to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin43">increase the rate of binge drinking</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin44">increase the rate of rearrests</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin45">increase the costs of hospitalization</a>,
 and even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="newwin46">increase
the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
Yes, even the death rate. And that comes from one of the Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous,
Prof. and Dr. George E. Vaillant, who found that Alcoholics Anonymous produced a zero-percent
improvement in sobriety, along with the worst death rate of any way of treating alcoholism
that he studied.
He spent nearly 20 years shoving A.A. treatment on sick alcoholics, and in the end, the best
that he could say for Alcoholics Anonymous was,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease. ... Not only had we
failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism, but our death rate
of three percent a year was appalling.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And that is the &quot;better measure of success&quot; that you were asking for.

<p>
By the way, those dead people are not free to leave A.A. and find something that they like better.

<p>
In addition, even though it has not been formally measured and documented,
I think a good case can be made that A.A. also increases the divorce rate and
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">
 the suicide rate in alcoholics</a>.
So it is highly questionable just how happy those repeatedly-relapsing A.A. members really are.
<p>
By the way, the fake evidence that you supplied is known as
 <a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank"><i>Proof By Anecdote</i></a>.
You told the story of one repeatedly-relapsing guy who is allegedly still very happy in A.A.,
and that is supposed to be evidence that all of the A.A. failures are really very, very happy in A.A.,
even if they do lose all of their Brownie Points every so often.
Nope, sorry, but I'm not buying it. That is not valid evidence of anything except that there is
one guy who keeps on drinking every so often.

<p>
Have a good day, and a Merry Christmas.
<p>
== Orange
<p>
<p>
P.S.: On rereading your letter, I realize that your &quot;Proof By Anecdote&quot;
was not even an anecdote, because it was not a story of a guy who actually existed.
It was a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hypothetical" target="_blank">hypothetical argument</a>.
You were just imagining that there <i>might be</i> one repeatedly-relapsing happy
A.A. member somewhere &#8212; some guy whose liver and brain are still okay in spite of continued
binge drinking for many years. Again, that is a very questionable giant &quot;IF&quot;.
<p>
What you are assuming there is that people who relapse after years of sobriety will just
immediately quit drinking after a short binge and then
go back to collecting more years of A.A. sobriety coins, again.
There isn't any evidence for that. Do you have any? My personal experience is that 22 years ago,
I quit drinking for three years, and stayed perfectly sober for all three
years, but then &quot;just had one&quot; at a party,
and ended up drinking for another 9 years before I really quit again. Yes, went out for 9 years. So
it is not a safe assumption that A.A. members who relapse and lose all of their sober time
will immediately quit drinking and go back to collecting more sobriety
coins, and will spend the vast majority of their lives sober in A.A.
<p>
And then of course there is the question of why your hypothetical A.A. member is repeatedly
relapsing all of his life. Why doesn't the A.A. program work for him?
Why doesn't he stay sober?
<p>
Have a good day, and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;David C.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Notes on NA<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
I am a drug addict. I am also an intelligent, and very well educated
scientist. I don't have any sense of a high-power working in my life, and I
believe that the job of staying clean is mine alone. I do happen to believe
that I am not responsible for my addiction; I don't mean in the sense the I
am not responsible for taking drugs &#8212; I am &#8212; but rather that I am not
responsible for the things that happened in my early life that left me
feeling a need to fill some empty place within me, that I then chose to fill
with drugs. I simply had that empty space, however, I was unwilling to face
that, so I turned to substances that made me feel better: a quick fix. I
also believe it is possible that there are genetic components at work, a
genetic predisposition to addiction, much as you suggested for the BBC video
about
<a href="orange-letters155.html#monkeys" target="newwin07">
 the alcoholic monkeys on that island</a>
 (was it Tobago or Trinidad? I
can't remember, now). For instance, I wonder if my almost instant love
affair with opiates is a consequence of lowered number of opiate receptors
or lowered production of endorphin type molecules in my brain. When I took
opiates, it wasn't really with the intension of getting high, as much as it
was that I actually felt &quot;normal&quot;. I felt like I could function properly. I
didn't need much, I wasn't taking them to the point of nodding off, I took a
little and went to work, then I took a little and went to bed. In fact, it
was only health problems that made me stop taking them at all. They were
playing havoc with my liver; since I was extracting my opiate from its
natural source, there may have been any number of other things in it, such
as pesticides, plus the other alkaloids the plant contains. I can't say the
same of meth...I just liked it.

<p>
I attend several NA meeting a week, more for support than for anything else.
I tried going to AA meetings, but found that I could not relate to the
people there, and found much more commonality with the people in NA.
Additionally, I was put off by the introductory response in AA, that if I
had a problem other than alcohol, I should go elsewhere, as though alcohol
is not a mind-altering drug. Even in NA, there are things I don't agree
with, and that make me uncomfortable, particularly when talking about the
&quot;god&quot; thing.

<p>
I don't feel powerless over drugs and alcohol. In fact, I really dislike
that opening phase in AA &quot;Remember that *we deal with alcohol*, *cunning*,
baffling, powerful&quot;; this is an anthropomorphic view point. Alcohol is a
combination of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, in a 2:6:1 ratio (CH3CH2OH); it
is a volatile, flammable, clear, colorless, liquid, with a molar mass of
46.07 g/mol, a density of 0.789 g/ml, a freezing point of -114C, and a
boiling point of 78C, etc. Nothing more, nothing less. It has no intrinsic
power over anyone, except what we give to it. A better, and far more
accurate statement might be: &quot;Remember, we deal with the human mind,
cunning, baffling, powerful.&quot; In fact, the simple act of deciding to get and
stay clean shows that I do have power of my addiction, though I would agree
that I am powerless over the fact that I was addicted to drugs. That is just
the reality. I am also powerless over the fact that I can never smoke meth
again, without suffering the its negative effects upon my mind and body.
That is just the reality of it.

<p>
That being said, I do like going to NA meetings. I feel that it is a good
support system. I live in a small town, near Sturgis SD, and I go to
meetings with fairly down to earth bikers, and people who are similar to
those I used with. I understand them, and they me. There are few in the
group I would consider radical in any way, about the the program, religion,
or anything else. This may not be typical of NA, but from my experience, NA
is not nearly as radical as AA. I have a sponsor, a crazy biker, who has
NEVER pushed me around, or told me what to do. He is just a friend who
understands my occasional bouts of depression and anger; a guy who I talk to
when I get a craving, and who will listen when I need to rant, and who can
usually offer some reassurance that if I can stay calm, act rational (in
other words, don't punch a hole in the wall, dude, that will just get your
&quot;old-lady&quot; even more pissed off at you), and talk it through, things will
probably work out. He often reminds me of something I once told him: that
when I get a craving, it is because I wish to avoid some conflict in my life
 &#8212; I don't like conflict. So far, he's been right.

<p>
I have worked the steps up to step nine, and I am working on that step now.
While, I agree with you, that under the wrong conditions, and with the wrong
people, this could lead to serious issues. For example, the manic-depressive
working with a narcissist who pushes him around to satisfy his own personal
power needs. In my case, though, some of these steps proved useful. There
was no groveling or wallowing in guilt and shame. There was only a simple
acknowledgement that I had lived my life in a less than honorable fashion,
and an examination as to the reasons. To be fair to myself, these were
things I was already working on, but it did help me to organize my thoughts
on them a little better. I think that making amends for them will help
strengthen my relationships as well. These family members and friends
already know that I did them harm, and they still love me, so I think that
by a simple acknowledgment to them that I am aware of the pain that I caused
them will go a long ways to repairing that damage. Again, there will be no
groveling and wallowing in guilt and shame, just a simple statement like
&quot;when I was using, I ran out of drugs, so I stole your vicodin. It won't
happen again.&quot; As to the higher-power thing, well as they say &quot;take what you
need and leave the rest.&quot;

<p>
I also have two sponsees. They are younger than me, and I can see something
of myself in them. However, I work VERY hard and not relaying this to them.
I don't want them to get the erroneous perception that I am condescending to
them. From the very beginning, I told them that I am not going to save them,
nor take credit for whatever they accomplish in staying clean. They do the
work, and they earn the credit: Not me! Not NA! Them! We do work the steps,
though not in a severe and groveling fashion. Rather, we just talk about our
lives, and how bad things had gotten, why, and what we can do about it &#8212; and
what to do if we feel that we might use again. I tell them at the beginning
that if they need someone to &quot;lead them to Jesus&quot; they might want to get a
different sponsor. NEVER have I told a sponsee to get down on their knees
and pray. NEVER has my advice been to &quot;let go and let god&quot;. And NEVER do I
tell them what to do &#8212; I have enough trouble knowing what I should do.

<p>
When I look at the steps in NA, obviously I look at the first step first. I
am glad that NA changed the wording when adopting it from AA: &quot;I am
powerless over my addiction&quot; makes more sense to me than &quot;powerless over
drugs (alcohol)&quot;, though even that bothers me. I am not powerless over
drugs, alcohol, or addiction. I *am* powerless over my past actions &#8212; no
matter how much I wish it was different, it is what it was. I did what I
done. I do agree that my life HAD become unmanageable. But I *can* and now
do manage my own life. All I needed to do was to stop using drugs, and start
accepting responsibility for managing it.

<p>
Step 2 &#8212; I don't know &#8212; it might work for some, but not for me. I was not
insane, though some of my actions were &quot;wacked out&quot;. I don't believe that a
power greater than my self will do it for me. I must do it. However, after
spending many years telling religious people how stupid they were, I finally
came to believe that I have no business telling people such a thing. Maybe
there is a god, they can't prove it, but I can't disprove it.

<p>
Step 3 &#8212; I don't understand at all. I have no concept of how to accomplish
such a thing, much less who to turn my will and my life over to. None of it
makes any sense to me at all, so I just simply ignored it, and went on.

<p>
Steps 4 and 5 were in my experience really one and the same. These two steps
were beneficial to me, but perhaps not in the way Bill W. had intended them.
For me, it helped me to see that the guilt and shame I had always felt were
WAY out of proportion to the wrongs I had actually committed &#8212; WAY, WAY out
of proportion. This allowed me to see that I have a severe problem with
self-respect, self-confidence, and feeling guilty and responsible for
actions which were not mine. This gave me insight into things I needed to
work out with my therapist; which I am, and I am much happier now that I am
no longer the world'd self-proclaimed martyr. I feel MUCH better.

<p>
Steps 6 and 7 don't make a great deal of sense to me. I am ready to be rid
of my character defects, but I have to let go of them. They are maladaptive
patterns of behavior that I initiated at some point, for some reason, that
worked for me for some time, but now don't. They are conditioned responses
to a self-perceived cruel and ugly world. The biggest problem is my
perception of the world as being cruel and ugly (and it is in some ways, but
there is so much beauty to find as well, that the cruel and ugly parts are
very small, by comparison). No one nor thing can do this for me. I must do
it for myself. Its really that simple. If lying is one of my character
defects, then amend it by not lying. If I have a problem with stealing, then
don't take what is not mine. Simple! Couldn't be any simpler!

<p>
Step 8 and 9, to me, are valid things to do. Make a list of who I harmed and
make amends, if possible and appropriate. I believe that this will help me
to fix some of the damaged relationships in my life &#8212; relationships that are
important to me. I see no problems with this, so long as the stress is not
so great that I use over it, which I won't, since I decided that I am not
going to use again. (I should note here that the desire to use was never
&quot;removed&quot;. I'm a junkie, I like the feeling of opiates and amphetamines. I
love the feeling. I sometime want that feeling again, sometime I even crave
it. I watched an episode of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; &#8212; a show about a high school
teacher who makes meth to pay for his chemo therapy &#8212; and I found myself
actually salivating, like poor Pavlov's dog (Does anyone happen to know that
poor dogs name?). But I am still not going to use, because I know where that
will take me).

<p>
Step 10 makes sense to me: &quot;I fucked up, sorry, I will actively work to
correct that&quot; &#8212; and then do actively work to correct that. Makes sense, if
you're wrong, admit it! Pretty clear, really.

<p>
Step 11, well, whatever puts the cream in your Twinkie, dude. Don't work for
me. I truly don't believe that I will ever have a conscious contact with god
 &#8212; just myself and the other lifeforms around me. This is enough for me.

<p>
Step 12: well, when I was young, I was put in Christian schools, and these
crazy fuckers actually had us going from door to door with religious tracts,
trying to &quot;carry the message&quot;. Oh, how I hated those fucks. So, &quot;carrying
the message&quot; is not something I do. I will, however, sit down with an addict
who actually wants to get and/or stay clean and talk, and listen, and help,
if possible. That's the extent to which I'll go. No further. If you want
help, I'll help, if possible, and if you are willing to take responsibility
for yourself.

<p>
I don't really know why I've written to you. I suppose it is because I found
what you had to say interesting and thought provoking. Some of what you say,
I can agree with, some not, but it did get me thinking about some of the
aspects of AA that I did not like, and compared them with NA. In my
experience, NA is not nearly as militant as AA, but it may be that if I were
to go to a big city meeting, I might feel differently. I agree with you that
I can take the credit for getting clean, but I have to offer some of the
credit to the people in NA (not the program itself, but the people in it)
for helping me stay clean. The program itself did offer me some steps that
helped me to sort through some of the wreckage of my actions, much like a
fire inspector will try to reconstruct how a fire started, and develop
guidelines that could keep it from happening again.

<p>
Anyway, thank you for all of the interesting information, the perspective
you have shared, and for offering me something to ponder. I hope you have a
great day and a wonderful Christmas,

Hello David,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. And congratulations on your clean and sober life.
You sound like another member of the &quot;<a href="orange-letters168.html#NRL" target="newwin939">The Newcomer Rescue League</a>&quot;.

<p>
You make a bunch of interesting points. I couldn't agree more
about the fact that ethanol is a clear hydrocarbon solvent that is not &quot;cunning, baffling,
and powerful&quot;, because it doesn't have a brain at all.
<p>
About your reactions to various drugs: One thing I know for sure is that different drugs
hit different people in different ways. What is a dangerous addicting drug to one person is
nothing to another person.
I, for example, tried both smack and cocaine and just walked away from them. Just not my cup of
tea. And I never liked speed. Too jittery. But alcohol and tobacco are so addicting that I
almost died from them. Go figure.

<p>
I also agree that introspection and straightening out your thinking is a good thing to do.
And cleaning up the past, where possible. It lowers the paranoia level.
<p>
What you did not mention is, things like seeing where in your childhood somebody messed with you
and damaged your ability to feel pleasure and well-being. You should read about
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">the study of the Cerebellar Vermis</a>.
<p>
I suspect that you will also like the <a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>, which I find very helpful for avoiding relapses.

<p>
I think you might also like SMART &#8212; Self-Management and Recovery Training &#8212;
you might get something good out of that, too,
but I don't know if they have any meetings in out-of-the-way places like Sturgis SD yet.
But then again, they might.
You can see the list of links for things like SMART
<a href="orange-letters209.html#alt_list" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life. And Merry Christmas.

Hello Michael,

Thanks for the picture. Yes, that really does say it all.
And they still maintain that A.A. is not a religion.
It really takes some strange twists of logic to keep a straight face while proclaiming that
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religion.

Subject:  	SMART<br>

<p>
Greetings orange hope your are well.. Its been a long time since i last
contacted you hope you have settled into your new place? Things over here in
England are going well especially with SMART some meetings we hold have been
getting in attendance of up to 25 people plus which is really a great
achievment and the feedback from members has been absolutely brilliant !! The
only critics have been yes you guessed our know-it-all friends at everybodys
favourite cult AA. Well theres a surprise LOL.. I wouldnt mind i have not once
ever slated AA and its members in a SMART group. For one its not
productive, its not what SMARTs about and TBH orange i really cant be
bothered getting into any kind of conflict with them people because as we
know its always a one sided argument. I find that they really are not
interested in your points of view if it doesnt fit in with theirs.. But
anyways on to a good note i am coming up to 2 years sober on the 18th of dec
a day before my real birthday and you know something this living sober lark
aint so bad after all !!
<p>
I have to say the more i read your stuff and i have to admit i never get
bored of browsing through your material even though i dont agree with 100%
you could say i agree with 99% but more importantly what i do agree with is
the FACT that AA is harmful and AA is a terrible terrible form of treatment
(if you can call it that). You know the more i reflect back to when i was a
member there the more i realise just how mentally ill i really was with all
the nonsense they were giving to me. As i think ive mentioned before in a
letter to you my underlying disorder to my drinking is OCD which thankfully
through REAL professional HELP and REAL medicene i seem to have it pretty
much under control !! I really cant imagine which i'm sure one exists is how
the heck could a 12 step group help people with OCD? I mean my OCD went
through the roof as a result of the 12steps of AA &#8212; the constant questioning
and the constent analyzing and they have the cheek then to say &quot;keep it
simple stupid&quot; hahahahaha.....
<p>
 Well i know some of this might sound like a
bit of a ramble but it is soooooooo reasuring to know that there are other
people out there who share the same views as myself about the absolute
madness that is AA. The bit i like the most is as you said if this is a REAL
disease then sponsors are breaking the law by treating this disease without
a license and also practicing medicine without a license by telling
sponsees to give up their doctor-prescribed tablets. i mean really this kind
of thing should be taken serious &#8212; i mean really serious &#8212; it should be an
offence!! I heard one once and it was before i came into SMART recovery and
that was by somebody from smart who i spoke to on the phone which was
something like this.... Bear in mind i was just breaking free from the cult
so my head was a complete mess here goes.......
<br>
ME....&quot;Yeah but this is a disease&quot;<br>
GUY ON PHONE &quot; A disease this aint no disease&quot;<br>
ME &quot;yeah but ive been told this is a disease. i have a disease&quot;<br>
GUY ON PHONE &quot;listen jamie if
this is a disease as you say, then its the first disease you have ever bought
from a pub or a off license boy. i bet the landlords having a right laff at
you&quot;
<p>
    And you know what Orange that conversation changed EVERYTHING from
then on pennys started dropping slowly but surely and to this day i'd love to
shake that mans hand!! WOW SMART yeah i believe its gunna be the way forward
it deserves to be the way forward it does exactly what it says on the tin
and i always tell people &quot;SMART wont keep you sober&quot; and they look at me and
i tell them &quot;its your job to keep sober. We're here to support you and help
you on the way with some very basic but effective tools but the hard part is
down to you hence the 'Self Management' of SMART, and once the message sinks
with people you can actually sort of sense the relief?? Anyways orange i
think ive gone on long enough.  Once again i hope you are in good health. Hope
the geese are ok and have a great Christmas and a brilliant new year. Your
material really has been SUCH A BIG HELP and i arnt trying to blow the wind
up your arse there niether. LOL it really has so thanks sooooo much and keep
up the brilliant work because we need people like you around !! Best wishes
and to a sober christmas your friend from over seas Jamie :)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Jamie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. Congratulations
on your years of sobriety. And thanks for running SMART meetings over in England.
And yes, I'm doing well too, and healthy, and everything.
And the geese are well too.

From:  	&quot;Lisa B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA and Geese &#8212; My Personal Experience<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,
Your website validates every bad feeling I've had about AA during the last four
months. I actually discovered (and read part of) your website before attending my
first AA meeting. I went in spite of what I had read  hoping it wasn't true. I was
hoping you were going to be wrong. I thought AA was a harmless organization designed
to help people by people just like me. Yeah right.

<p>
I had issues with AA from my very first meeting. I met a lady there who had been
attending AA meetings forty years. FORTY years. It was then I realized AA does
nothing to prepare you for living a sober life WITHOUT them. They want you to be
dependent upon the group and the organization FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. I wasn't
searching for a new religion when I went to them. I was searching for a way to stop
drinking without going crazy.

<p>
For awhile I convinced myself it was the alcoholic in me not wanting to
receive help. &quot;Maybe I am looking for an out. Maybe I want to continue
going down the path I am on. Maybe I don't want to stop drinking.&quot; I can no longer
turn a blind eye to what is really going on.

<p>
I find the whole sponsorship concept to be downright scary. Let's see, pick a total
stranger out of the crowd to guide you through the steps. A person you do not know
to tell your innermost personal secrets to and to take advice from. I gathered from
the meeting speak that a lot of the sponsors had more than one sponsee. It seemed
like some of them were collecting sponsees because they had so many. Some of the
sponsees really freaked me out when I heard about the Svengali-like hold their
sponsors had on them.

<p>
They will make everything all about you during your first meeting or two if you tell
them it's your first, second, or third meeting. A lot of people will offer to
sponsor you or tell you to get a sponsor quickly and work the steps. They will give
you their phone numbers and want yours. They will call you to get you to keep coming
back.

<p>
I do not understand why I need AA when I have God in my life. Why does AA have to be
the middleman? Why can't I cut out AA and deal with God directly? Why have they
changed God's name to Bill?

<p>
I will give AA credit where credit is due. They did help me to get sober. But it has
been my will and determination that has kept me sober. After about a month I had too
many questions and too few answers. Plus the bad gut feeling I walked around with.
My intuition was/is telling me this is not a good thing. I had a lady (who wanted to
be my sponsor) tell me the reason I was still craving after a month was because I
didn't have a sponsor and was not working the steps.

<p>
I am still craving four months of sobriety later. It has to do with the way my brain
is wired. Nothing more. Nothing less. I've always liked to get high.

<p>
I also have to question why it's okay for people to use nicotine, caffeine, and food
the way they do at meetings. All three are bad for you. Two of the three are known
killers and will kill you given enough time. The bags of chocolate I see being
passed around at the meetings are huge.

<p>
By the way, I loved the pictures of the goslings. Have you ever seen the size of an
adult goose's turds? The reason I ask is because I live on a lake. The geese come
here during the Winter. I hate it when they shit in our yard and the shit gets on my
shoes. My seventy pound black lab mix doesn't shit as big as those birds do. She is
terrified of the geese. She won't go near them but she will roll in their shit.

<p>
Thanks for the website!

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Lisa

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Lisa,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and the compliments. And I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
And congratulations on your sobriety. Of course I don't need to tell you that you are doing
it yourself.
<p>
Yes, the whole sponsorship thing is really disturbing. And that is one of the key characteristics
of a cult. It's in &quot;<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>&quot;.
The question of mentors or sponsors is
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_mentoring" target="_blank"> here</a>
and the answer for A.A. is
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_mentoring" target="_blank"> here</a>.
<p>
Oh yeh, and then you wrote about
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_no_exit" target="_blank">No Exit</a>, which
is another standard cult characteristic. You have to stay in the cult
for your whole life.
<p>
And you also mentioned,
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">Newcomers can't think right</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">Newcomers Need Fixing</a>.
And
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_instant_community" target="_blank">Instant Community</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_instant_intimacy" target="_blank">Instant Intimacy</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_intrusiveness" target="_blank">Intrusiveness</a>.
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

<p>
About the geese: Yes, having a lot of goose shit around is just the price of having geese.
They eat grass more than anything else, which is a low-calory, low-protein diet, so they have
to eat <i>a lot</i> of grass to get their nourishment, which means that they also produce a lot
of shit. Fortunately, goose shit isn't that bad. It is basically just chewed-up grass.
It eventually soaks into the ground and builds up the topsoil.
But I understand how some people get grossed out by the goose shit all over the lawns.
Me, I just ignore it, and make sure I don't put my towel or blanket down on it when I sit down.
<p>
I can understand how your dog is afraid of the geese. Canada Geese are normally very mellow and easy-going,
but they <i>really</i> don't like dogs, because foxes and wolves and cayotes have been eating
geese and goslings for millions of years. So the geese will attack dogs if they think they can win
the battle. And they aren't above ganging up on a dog, either.
They think that two or three or four angry ganders on one dog is just fine.
(It is possible that the reason that your dog is afraid of the geese is because they already
attacked the dog when you weren't looking.)
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject: 	Hello Orange<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,
<p>
Thank you for all your analysis of the AA programme &amp; all the
techniques for critical thinking, a faculty I realised I had abdicated within the
first 2 years of my attendance at AA, although I had plenty of help with that.
Lots of good-cop/bad-cop stuff &amp; appeal to vanity &amp; some other horror show stuff.
Those robot/clone droids sure know which buttons to push. The dehomag is never
sleeps.
<p>
Saw a piece on &quot;Sober Recovery claiming that the slogan &quot;Think Think Think&quot; was an
old IBM rallying call from the 1950's.
<p>
Here they call the meetings &quot;traps&quot; as in
&quot;See you round the traps&quot; Also &quot;You now
belong to the club of those with no rights&quot; is a common saying. Everyone here is
either atheist or Bill Wilson all purpose generic, one-size-fits-all God. Your own
concept as long as it's not Christian &#8212; that's not tolerated. But hey who wants to be
tolerated!
<p>
I've now joined Amnesty International.
<p>
I believe in God.
<p>
Actually I have never believed alcoholism was a disease; when I shared that, that
I did not believe in the disease concept, a oldertimer got very apopleptic, told
me off &amp; threatened, that &quot;I 'd better start toeing the line or else!&quot;
Towards the end of AA for me, I asked my sponsor if &quot;It was a sin to save one's
life&quot; (it was mostly a rhetorical question). I suspect that in her eyes &quot;self
preservation&quot; was indeed a sin or it would be played that way. But let's face it,
even Jesus Christ sometimes took evasive action when he was here on earth.
<p>
So many other agencies are all over AA today.
<p>
I am 2 months free of AA meetings. This is weird &amp; awful but I had to sit on my
hands to stop myself going to meetings. I have always done 3-7 meets a week for 21
years. S'pose that's why.
<p>
My credulity was shattered when I found that
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">AAWS had sued a guy in Germany for
giving away BBs</a>. I actually couldn't believe it at first, thought someone was
loading misinformation into my computer. Everyone I asked from AA either knew
nothing, didn't want to know or dismissed it &amp; made excuses re AAWS (your point &quot;It
is AA&quot; was very helpful when dealing with the AAdroogs who tried to claim separate
entity justification.)
<p>
Then 2 people from NY GSO &amp; a trustee came to my city to, well hold a public
meeting, so I stood up &amp; asked them whether they had indeed sued the guy &amp; they
said &quot;yes they had sued him,&quot; then the GSO woman (Phyllis) proceeded to justify
that the German Govt had made AA do it, etc., etc. &quot;I only work here, I swear I
never knew,&quot; &quot;I was only following orders&quot;, man it's all so familiar, isn't it?
<p>
Not one single AA spoke to me about this, either in the meeting forum or
afterwards. I left that public meeting &amp; I have not returned. Something is very
wrong in AA. I think maybe, worse than a cult. Your website is showing only the tip
of the iceberg, comprehesive although it is. I read
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#Lifton1" target="_blank">Lifton's stuff, the 8 points to a cult</a>
in early 90's &amp; eugenics was pointed out to me in my 1st year &amp; Buchman.
<p>
I hope you r real<br>

Hi Anthony,
<p>
Thanks for the link. All I can say is, &quot;Yuk! Oh, yuk!&quot;
The idea of being groped by that guy is not appealing.

<p>
I thought that this was the most interesting paragraph:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Marsh is in no danger of being removed from AA, no matter the outcome
of the legal process. Instead, the matter will be dealt with during
Marsh's group sessions.
<br>
&quot;We don't condone illegal behavior, but no one can be kicked out
of AA,&quot; said a public information staff member from the General
Service Office of AA in Manhattan, who also maintained anonymity.
<br>
&quot;This is about the whole group coming together and very, thoughtfully,
carefully, meticulously deciding whether the person's behavior is a threat
to group unity,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;Our first tradition
is maintaining the unity of the group.&quot; 
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

Right. We can't harm the &quot;unity of the group&quot;, can we? No matter
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">how many girls get molested</a>,
nobody will get kicked out of A.A.
<p>
But honestly, what about the effect on women's attempts to get and stay sober?
How are women supposed to work on their sobriety issues when they have to spend all of their time
defending themselves from the other A.A. members?
<p>
Now I see why some women quit A.A. here in Oregon and established a
<a href="orange-links.html#WFS" target="newwin2001"><i>Women For Sobriety</i></a>
chapter. They were just tired of the guys hitting on them, and wanted a group where they
could really talk about their alcohol problems without a dozen guys vamping on their bodies.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
Is all of the information published on your website available in book form?  I
could sit here and read for hours, but reading from a book would be much easier.
<p>
By the way,  I quit drinking ALL BY MYSELF.

Hello Dianne,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
Alas, there is no dead-tree edition of the Orange Papers.
What I recommend is that people download the whole thing and
burn a CD. You can get all of the archive files that make up the web site
<a href="menu1.html#archives" target="_blank">here</a>,
and instructions for burning a CD are
<a href="orange-letters29.html#make_CD" target="_blank">here</a>.

Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;David C.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Survey of your responses<br>

<p>
Good evening Orange,

<p>
First let me offer my apologies for writing yet again, without waiting for a
response from you first. Its just that I have been reading your site for
four days straight, and have had some interesting insights as a consequence.
I'll get to my latest in a second, but first, to interject a little humor, I
have come to realize that:

<p>
<ul>

<p><li>
1. I am powerless over reading your website, and that my eyesight has become
unmanageable.
<p><li>
2. I have come to believe that an optometrist greater than myself may be
needed to restore my now damaged vision to 20/20.
<p><li>
3. I am soon going to turn my will and my life over to the care of sleep, as
I understand it, because I can't see straight any longer.
<p><li>
4. I will soon make a searching and fearless inventory of my bed.
<p><li>
5. I will admit to god, myself, and you the exact nature of my fatigue: (I'm
tired of reading all these letters)
<p><li>
6. I just can't make it to 12 steps, without collapsing, so I am not going
to work the rest of this program. Perhaps this means I have not reached
bottom yet. Does this make me a dry insomniac?
</ul>

<p>
Anyway, I was thinking that as a measure of the serenity of AA/ NA members,
it might be interesting for you to use the outrageous amount of email you
have posted as a way to conduct a survey. For example, you could divide your
email into two main categories; email from true believers and email from
skeptics, and then divide the true believer email into those who would
simply try to debate you but ultimately wish you well, and compare them to
those who maliciously attack you and wish you ill, such as those who have
told you to &quot;enjoy your DUI&quot; and hope you &quot;die a horrible death&quot;, and called
you nasty names, etc. This would allow you to then run a statistical
analysis on the serenity factor (SAA) of AA members: percentage of
well-wishing AA members to caustic hate-mongers. A correlation analysis of
length of sobriety versus SAA would be very illuminating. You might then
conduct a comparison of the serenity of true believers to skeptics (though
this would be far more likely to be biased, since your sample set may have
too much self-selection bias). You could even utilize p-values (as you were
erroneously (not erogenously) criticized for not understanding its meaning
somewhere in the first 15 pages of letters). Just a thought for using this
vast amount of information in a more revealing way.

<p>
I have really enjoyed your capacity for debate. You really don't need to go
to such lengths with some of these letters, these people show their
ignorance of logical thinking all on their own, but it makes for great
entertainment. However, at least for a week, I am going to attend AORA
(Agent Orange Readers Anonymous) meetings, and try to abstain from reading
your site for a few weeks. Its no wonder you are just now answering November
mail. You have serious stamina, brother (or sister). Keep up the good work.

<p>
I would like to correspond more, if you are interested.

<p>
Oh well, have a great day anyway! ;)~

Hello again, David,
<p>
Please don't apologize for the letter, that's funny.
<p>
I love your statistical study. I don't know if I will get around to correlating all of
that information, but just from a casual glance at the letters, I can tell that some
A.A. members have been eating too many Fizzies&reg; &#8212; they really pop a cork when
disturbed.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
I can' t for the life understand why people have this desire to tear AA
down &#8212; just don't come to it &#8212; that simple &#8212; if you got something that
works &#8212; well &#8212; write about that &#8212; don't  try to raise yourself up by
tearing something down &#8212; of course there is the alcohol industry and
religion &#8212; that's about money and exclusive religions. There are also
those who did not seem to make it work &#8212; but my friend its like
pornography &#8212; if you don't like it &#8212; don't watch it.

<p>
As for me I spent a good 30 years trying to make alcohol fit &#8212; I was a
hopeless drunk &#8212; the Jesus wand had been waived over me for years as the
shit life I was leading kept adding to the tape running in my head &#8212;
forgiveness was pretty keen in the life to come but not so keen if you
were the holder of my bad checks. It was only the 4th &#8212; through the 9th
that put me back into life and shut the tape off &#8212; that's physics my
friend. Somehow this bothers religions &#8212; got to get a piece of pie ....

<p>
So shrinks get your doe and write a prescription &#8212; all you preachers &#8212; 
kill a few more drunks &#8212; ( by the way I have never seen any pastor &#8212; or
mine of some 10 years cure one damned thing &#8212; no cancer &#8212; not heroin
addiction &#8212; not nothing &#8212; when they can't they call it God's will &#8212; 

<p>
Write a book and have a drink in your mansion.

<p>
Everyone pay for what they use &#8212; therapy &#8212; shrinks &#8212; medications &#8212; and
AA &#8212;  that's physics my friend &#8212; God's law.

Hello Dale,
<p>
The reason that I do this web site is because A.A. tells a lot of lies and harms a lot of people
with those lies, so somebody has to tell the truth.
<p>
For a partial list of those lies, try reading
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Lies of A.A.</a>
and
<a href="orange-secrets.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Secrets of A.A.</a>.

<p>
Then, if you are really interested in learning about how well A.A. works, you could read
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas now.
