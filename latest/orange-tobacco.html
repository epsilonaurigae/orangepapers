<p>

The worst thing about tobacco is not that it kills you in the end,
but that it stops you from living to the fullest for most of your adult life. If tobacco
only killed you quickly at 40 or 50 or 60, then it wouldn't be so
bad.
<p>
It would be a strange retirement plan, like a funny reverse lottery:
Tobacco would just roll
the dice, and decide what perfectly healthy person will suddenly
drop dead today.
<p>
But tobacco doesn't do that. It not only kills you in the end,
it also slowly degrades your whole life before it kills you. It drags you down, and
makes you feel tired and slightly sick, most all of your adult life. You
never quite have the energy to do all of the things you want to do,
or wish you had done, whether it was tackle a big physical job or
play more with your kids. You never quite feel like really living
because you are always half dead.

<p>
Addiction to tobacco is like a progressive deadly disease. It doesn't seem too bad
when you are a teenager, or in your twenties. You are young and
strong and healthy, and it seems like it just takes the edge off of
bad feelings. It will take a bunch of
years before it seriously clogs up your lungs and makes you into a
tired cripple who is just dragging his ass through life.
It will take a few more years before the emphysema sets in, and you
are gasping for your next breath.

<p>
Tobacco can take your teeth. It took mine. One of my dentists said
that the gum disease I had, first called gingivitis, and then called
advanced peridontal disease, was started by coffee, cigarettes, and
bad nerves, in combination. So it takes a period of stress, combined
with coffee and cigarettes.  Periods of stress are easy to come by,
so if you also have a coffee and cigarette habit, you can get gum
disease started.
Once it is started, it will progressively eat away at your gums
until your teeth come loose.
Continuing to smoke just makes the disease progress more rapidly.


<p>
I pulled one of my teeth with my fingers &#8212; my lower left fang.  It
was so loose that it was just flopping around in the socket, and it
really hurt whenever it twisted sideways when I bit down. I was
wondering what was still holding it in the socket.  So I pulled on it
with my fingers, and it came out. Nothing but suction had been
holding it in.

<p>
I pulled one of my upper front incisors with a pair of pliers. The
tooth was really loose, and the socket was infected, and it was
really painful, so I just grasped it with a pair of small pliers and
then used my other hand to karate chop the first hand
and out the tooth came. It was really only hanging by a thread of
infected flesh anyway.

<p>
Unfortunately, the big molars have big roots with two or three
branches that spread out and are anchored in the jawbone, so you
can't pull those molars out by yourself.
The dentist has to do them for you,
and you will want a lot of painkillers, like novocaine or xylocaine.
Unfortunately, when the gums are really infected, the painkillers
stop working. No joke.
It is one of Mother Nature's most horrible nasty little
surprises. The worse the infection underneath the tooth is, the bigger
the abcess is, and the less the xylocaine works. The infection inflames
the nerves and keeps the xylocaine from soaking into the
nerves, so the nerves don't get deadened.
I once had a dentist shoot four whole syringes full of
xylocaine into my jaw, trying to deaden it, and I still felt
<i>everything</i> as he twisted the tooth, and broke it loose, and
pulled it out. And I do mean I really felt <i>everything</i>. He had
shot so much xylocaine into me that I had a cocaine buzz from it
afterwards, but I still felt that tooth come out, in exquisite,
agonizing detail.

<p>
That's just one of the benefits that tobacco offers you.


<p>
Speaking of benefits, there is another funny benefit that abcessed
gums can give you: nightmares. When the pus from your teeth gets
into your bloodstream, it gets to your brain and gives you the most
horrendous dreams you will ever have. Really sick, weird, twisted,
bizarre nightmarish stuff. Stuff so weird that sometimes I woke up
thinking that I had the script for a surefire hit movie, a really
original, really frightening Hollywood horror movie.  Unfortunately,
the details faded out when exposed to daylight, and I forgot the
stuff before I could write it down, and it wasn't so frightening if
you didn't have a head full of pus.

<p>
It shouldn't come as any surprise that such dental problems
then lead to over-consumption of alcohol. It's just another pain
killer by then.

<p>
The funny thing is that people can continue to smoke even
after tobacco has caused them such horrible pain. It's amazing
just how much pain people will tolerate, just to continue
smoking. That's why it's an addiction.

<p>
An addiction is where you say, &quot;This stuff is killing me. I feel
awful. I've really got to stop doing this. But let me take a little
bit more of it right now, so I can feel a little better right now.&quot;

<p>
And that routine can go on for the rest of your life.
And it can be the end of your life.
