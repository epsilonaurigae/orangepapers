<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_no_respect">51</a>.
<i>Members Get No Respect. They Get Abused.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
Newcomers are not treated with respect. They are told that they are
dishonest, selfish, self-seeking, guilty of everything,
&quot;thinking alcoholically&quot;, <i>in denial</i>, unspiritual,
and immoral &#8212;
suffering from a spiritual disease because they are not <i>&quot;Seeking and Doing
the Will of God.&quot;</i>
<p>
Dissent is suppressed, and dissenters are not treated with respect.
Any newcomers who disagree with the crazy A.A. ideology and Buchmanite religious dogma
are told that they are diseased and <i>in denial</i>.
<p>
<a name="sexualpred">
Not only does A.A. demand that you surrender your mind and your will
to the cult, but
all too often, it is the sponsors who demand that you surrender</a>
your mind or your will to them, especially the sexual predator
sponsors, and the energy-sucking vampires
who get their kicks by running other peoples' lives. In fact,
sponsors can be extremely dangerous in
this regard: when someone does a fearless moral inventory, he or she
is supposed to confess all of his or her
sins and &quot;defects of character&quot; and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
to another person and to God. The &quot;other person&quot;
is almost always the sponsor. Thus, to a great
extent, the new inductee surrenders to the sponsor, who ends up
knowing all of his or her innermost
dirty little secrets, and runs his or her life and
even guides his or her thinking.
And if the sponsor is unscrupulous,
the opportunities for blackmail, exploitation or manipulation are
enormous.

<p>
<a name="exploitation">
And it is all too common</a> &#8212; how could it be otherwise? If
you just pick a bunch of drunks and
dopers at random, you will find a fair sample of felons, thieves,
con artists, brutal bullies, selfish scammers, and like characters among
them. They don't all immediately turn into angels just because
they went to a few A.A. meetings, in spite
of the fairy tale that says they do because the Twelve Steps are
so powerful.

<p>
<a name="sexual_exploitation">
Sexual exploitation of
newcomers is so common that they even have a well-known nickname for it:
&quot;<i>thirteenth stepping</i>&quot; somebody.
<i>(First you teach them the Twelve Steps, and then you
get them in bed and teach them the Thirteenth Step.)</i>
Women and men, old, young, and younger, straight or lesbian or gay, all
can be targets.

<p>
It took me only a few hours of searching the Internet for
information on A.A. to stumble across
many web pages describing thirteenth stepping, written by victims
of it themselves, but the national A.A. organizations are claiming to be
&quot;<i>shocked</i>&quot; to discover that it exists. On July 5,
2000, a memo from the headquarters of the British A.A. was leaked to
the Glasgow, Scotland <i>Herald</i> newspaper, which reported:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Vulnerable alcoholics seeking help for their addiction
are being subjected to sexual and other abuse at the
hands of long-serving volunteers from the world's largest
alcohol support group.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An internal memorandum circulated to every
Alcoholics Anonymous group in the country reveals that
volunteer members are increasingly being investigated by
police forces examining allegations of sexual abuse.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
According to the memo, leaked to the
Glasgow-based <i>Herald</i> newspaper, within A.A. &quot;there is a
small minority of men and women who operate with sick
but hidden agendas, and, no matter what they may say,
they seek self-gratification often at the expense of other
members or potential members&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A senior alcohol addiction worker said: &quot;It came as
a bit of a shock to me and I have never picked up on
these allegations before. A.A. [is] in a difficult position: we
all put checks and balances in place, but it is very difficult
to protect people entirely from abuse of position because
the people involved are invariably clever.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The senior worker says he
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;never picked up on these allegations before.&quot;</font>
That's funny, because I heard about that kind of stuff in my first few
months of attending meetings:
<font color="blue">
&quot;Just go across the river, to the meeting at the St. Francis church,
and there is a guy over there who manages to sponsor every woman who walks
in the door. He gets them all. And he's teaching them more than just
the Twelve Steps.&quot;
</font>
<p>
And,
<font color="blue">
&quot;My first sponsor in Dual Recovery Anonymous had women all of the
time. I couldn't even get ahold of him, because he was always out with
some woman. I had to get a new sponsor just to be able to talk to my
sponsor. And my new sponsor said that he doesn't think the other
guy even is an addict &#8212; he just goes to the meetings to get the
women.&quot;
</font>

<p>
And it just goes on and on.
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#horror_stories">Rebecca Fransway</a> compiled a whole
book of such stories, <i>Twelve-Step Horror Stories</i>.
It's recommended reading.
<p>
Then national media like <i>Newsweek</i> magazine and MSNBC reported
the story of the Midtown Group in Washington DC, which specializes in the sexual exploitation
of underage girls. Newcomer girls are immediately assigned an older man as her &quot;sponsor&quot;, who will
teach her &quot;how to have sober sex&quot;. Girls report that it is normal to have a sexually-transmitted
disease within three months of joining the Midtown Group. Read all about it
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Above all, don't forget that the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson,
is the one who started the A.A. tradition of &quot;Thirteenth-Stepping&quot; &#8212;
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">sexually exploiting the pretty young women</a> who
come to A.A. meetings seeking help to survive alcohol addiction.
It's a time-honored tradition, followed much more than some of the other
so-called &quot;<a href="orange-traditions.html">Traditions</a>&quot;...
<p>
<a name="hpredator">
And the stories keep</a> showing up on Usenet too, particularly
in <b>alt.recovery.from-12-Steps</b>.
In early August 2001, a <i><b>pro-A.A.</b></i> fellow,
who was defending A.A., not criticizing it,
calmly mentioned that his introduction to A.A. included:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA members have indeed harmed others. In fact, in my own experience, my
first sponsor turned out to be a very well-disguised homosexual predator,
and, if it weren't for my extremely gifted physical condition at the time,
and my ability to survive a jog through the dense northern Ontario bush in
the middle of the night and the dead of winter, I would probably be dead
from AIDS right now.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This does happen, and I stayed away from AA for many years. It took me
a while to realize this was not the fault of AA, any more than court-ordered
attendance is AA's fault. I avoid meetings where these guys are attending
personally.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

And a respondent commented:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And how is the newcomer supposed to know &quot;where these guys are
attending&quot;, or which meetings are likely to harbour such individuals?
You and I are lucky, Stuart, AA has worked for us and, as a
consequence, we have our wits and our faculties about us. Newly sober
alcoholics are very different, and of a completely different mindset.
No-one *tells* them about the perils that can await within AA, about
the dangerous predators that do, without question, infest an
unfortunate proportion of the rooms. They have to find out for
themselves, often with tragic results.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="coerced_attendance"> </a>
&#8212; And court-ordered attendance is most assuredly the fault of A.A., and N.A..
They encourage it: the A.A. and N.A. true-believer
drug and alcohol &quot;recovery counselors&quot;
(Twelfth Step recruiters) tell the judges
and parole officers that A.A. and N.A. are the only things that work,
and that giving people &quot;treatment&quot; &#8212; based on the
Twelve Steps, of course &#8212; and
sending people to A.A. or N.A. meetings is the best thing to do with them.
A.A. and N.A. could stop it immediately, by telling the courts that
they do not want coerced referrals, and that they will not
sign any more court slips. But they aren't about to stop it, because
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coerced_attendance">they will lose between one third
and two thirds of their new recruits</a> if they do.
<p>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Little_Red_Book"><i>The Little
Red Book</i> of Hazelden</a> specifically teaches A.A. recruiters to
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Little_Red_Book">indoctrinate judges, police,
doctors, clergy, and other officials</a> as part of the proselytizing work,
and get them to force more people into Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

<p>
<a name="healthy_wealthy"> </a>
People who do not get a sexual predator for a sponsor still
run the risk of getting a dogmatic
religious fanatic, or a neurotic manipulative fool, or a control
freak, or any other kind of alcoholic or
dope fiend loser you can imagine. Healthy, wealthy, and wise
people do not join A.A. or N.A., so your odds
of getting a wise, intelligent, compassionate, saintly sponsor to
help you with your recovery are very,
very low. And there are simply no requirements for sponsorship,
other than that the sponsor is
supposed to have a bunch of clean and sober time.
<p>
Also read a few letters from some refugees from A.A.:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors" target="newwin11">First, an A.A. sponsor steals
the newcomer's girlfriend, then other A.A. members seduce his 15-year-old

<i>Inconsistency. Contradictory Messages.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>

The actual value system of a cult is often the antithesis
of the system that it advertises, and A.A. is no exception to that rule of thumb.
Alcoholics Anonymous is loaded with contradictions and inconsistencies:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>&quot;We offer you
<a href="orange-heresy.html#unconditional_love">unconditional love and acceptance</a>.&quot;</b><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;And the conditions under which we will give you some
'unconditional love and approval' are:&quot;<br>
</font>
<font color="blue">
<ul>
<li> &quot;You must practice absolute abstinence from alcohol.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must go to lots of meetings.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must believe in the Twelve Steps and practice them.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must believe in a tyrannical God or <i>Higher Power</i> who will
alternate between dictating work orders and
answering your prayers, granting your wishes, and delivering miracles on demand.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must revere Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must never question the A.A. program.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must never contradict A.A. doctrines or dogma.&quot;
<li> &quot;You must keep it simple, stupid!&quot;
<li> &quot;You must recruit more members.&quot;

<i>Hierarchical, Authoritarian Power Structure, and Social Castes</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 5.<br>
<p>
First off, there is the obvious pyramid of sponsors, whom newcomers are supposed to
obey without question. The highest social caste
is the old-timers, those people with 20 or 30 years of <i>Time</i>.
Then the rest of the members are ranked by how much sober <i>Time</i> they have.

<p>
The relationship between sponsors and sponsees can be very authoritarian, where
the orders of sponsors are to be followed without question, and are always backed up by
the threat of &quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot; if not followed
correctly.
<p>
Most cults feature &quot;Undemocratic Reality, Control-oriented Leadership,
and Superdemocracy or Pseudo-democracy&quot;, and so does Alcoholics Anonymous.
In fact, the general membership is complaining that the New York headquarters
has become completely out of control, and no longer obeys or responds to
the membership whom it is supposed to be obeying and serving.
The &quot;democracy&quot; in A.A. is a sham. It doesn't matter how the membership
votes, nothing changes.

On another level, Bill Wilson's political philosophy was essentially the same as that
of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a>:
He favored theocracy and fascism.

In A.A. there is active still another form of association, a form of which
the world is today in great doubt. It has its virtues, nevertheless,
especially for us of Alcoholics Anonymous: I am speaking of dictatorship.
In A.A. we have two dictators, and we profit and grow through both.
One is John Barleycorn, who is never very far from the elbow of each of us.
The other is the Father of Lights, who presides over all men.
God is saying to us, &quot;Learn my will and do it.&quot; And John Barleycorn is saying

<p>
Note how Bill Wilson bemoaned the fact that dictatorships had gone
out of fashion. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin really gave
dictatorships a bad name during World War II, but that didn't stop
Bill Wilson from loving dictatorships as a form of government &#8212;
just as long as he got to be the leader.
<p>
In fact, Bill Wilson even praised dictatorships himself, and later bragged that
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#Bill_fascist" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous
had &quot;all of the advantages of the modern dictatorship&quot;</a>.

<p>

<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_double_binds">56</a>.
<i>Use of double-binds</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
The first double-bind a newcomer is likely to encounter is the question of
whether he is an alcoholic:<br>
<ul>
<li> If he admits that he is an alcoholic, then that
proves that he is an alcoholic.
<li> If he denies being an alcoholic, then that
proves that he is an alcoholic who is <i>in denial</i>,
so sick that he denies the &quot;obvious truth&quot;
that he is an alcoholic.
</ul>
Damned if you do, and damned if you don't. You just can't get out of it.
Either way, you are an alcoholic.

<p>
The standard A.A. religious dogma says that alcoholics are just loaded with &quot;moral
shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of character&quot;, and that one of their common
defects is that they are so
dishonest that they will only admit to having (&quot;claim&quot;)
some of those defects. They deny
the others, and can only gradually admit just how bad they really are. And then
the dogma also says that we love our defects (or
<a href="orange-secrets.html#exceed_intended_purpose">sins, as Bill Wilson called
them in 12x12</a>), and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Gorski1">we don't want to give them up</a>.
According to Bill Wilson, alcoholics are spiritual slobs
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#too_good">who don't want to get
too good too soon</a>.
<p>
Notice how &quot;claiming your defects&quot; is a
<i>&quot;damned if you do and damned if you don't&quot;</i>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind">double-bind</a>,
just like a medieval witch trial:<br>
<ul>
<li> If you &quot;claim&quot; a bunch of defects, then you are confessing that you are
a defective, flawed sinner.<br>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters.html#claim_defects">If you don't &quot;claim&quot; a bunch of defects</a>,
then that proves that
you are a dishonest defective flawed sinner who is <i>in denial</i> and refusing to
be truthful about what a bad sinner you are.
</ul>

<p>
All such double-binds induce a feeling of powerlessness in the victim.
That is one of the essential elements of
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison">any successful brainwashing program</a>.

<p>
<a name="Bills_crimes"> </a>
First off, while he was alive, Bill Wilson got away with everything.<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith">Bill Wilson robbed A.A.</a> all he could &#8212;
he embezzled the <i>Big Book</i>
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">publishing fund</a>, and
stole the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i>.
He never paid the money back; in fact, he took more money.
He got away with conning <i>The Alcoholic Foundation</i> into supporting him
for the rest of his life. They even bought him a Cadillac car and a big house in
the country. Bill died rich as a result of his dishonesty.

<li>
Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">lied constantly</a>, and babbled his
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">grandiose religious delusions</a> non-stop,
and nobody called him on it, and asked him to be sane and realistic.
Nobody demanded that he tell the truth.

<li>
Bill wrote his crazy cult-religion philosophy down in books and then foisted them
on others as the best (or only) cure for alcoholism, and claimed that his sermons
were the height of spirituality, and few people dared to contradict him. When
one guy &#8212; Ed &#8212; did,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik">Bill Wilson and his henchmen
ostracized Ed and condemned him to death by alcoholism</a>.


<li>
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">
He philandered and cheated on his wife constantly</a>, and he used A.A. to do it.
He thirteenth-stepped many
of the women who came to A.A. meetings looking for help, which is grossly unethical &#8212;
taking advantage of women when they are sick and desperately seeking help to recover
from alcoholism. (Good doctors do not screw their patients. That is grounds for a
doctor to lose his license to practice medicine.)
<li>
Bill Wilson also used the A.A. headquarters office as an employment agency for
his mistresses &#8212; women got hired as A.A. office staff because they were his girlfriends,
no clerical skills required.
The rest of the A.A. members just let Bill get away with it, and scurried around
covering it all up whenever another scandal exploded.
</ul>

<p>
And now, the current leaders do not answer to the rank and file membership.
The current leadership is pursuing criminal policies.
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">They have committed perjury
in both Germany and Mexico</a> to keep other A.A. members from printing and giving away
cheap copies of old, out-of-copyright versions of the <i>Big Book</i>.

the leaders just ignored it. The leaders are completely beyond the control of
the members.

<p>
<a name="Bills_training"> </a>
Bill Wilson fancied himself such a wise and knowledgeable alcoholism rehabilitation counselor
that he was qualified to write contracts that bound all of the other alcoholics to
programs from which they could not escape.
Wilson considered himself a guru who was qualified to dispense spiritual
advice to all of the other alcoholics, and tell them what to think and
what to do. But nobody told Bill Wilson what to think or what to do, or
corrected his &quot;spirituality&quot;.
<p>
And what training or preparation qualified Mr. Wilson
to be an alcoholism recovery counselor and a priest?
<ul>
<li> Which seminary did he graduate from? <font color="#9F0000">&nbsp;None.</font>
<li> What religion trained him and ordained him as a priest? <font color="#9F0000">&nbsp;None did.</font>
<li> Who were Bill's gurus? <font color="#9F0000">&nbsp;Jim Beam and Jack Daniels</font>.

<li> Bill drank a whole lot
of prohibition whiskey and bathtub gin for many years,
until Dr. Silkworth said that Bill was showing signs of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#bathtub_gin">brain damage</a>.
<li> Bill's sources of religious knowledge were:
<ul>
<li>  some high school years spent at The Burr &amp; Burton Seminary,
a private school in Manchester, Vermont
(<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education">where Bill failed to graduate</a>),
<li> and then he had a hallucinatory experience that he later
described as
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience">a hot flash</a>&quot;
from belladonna and other drugs while detoxing in the hospital, and &quot;saw God&quot;...
<li> and then he was coached by some religious-fanatic recruiters from
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult</a>.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
That's it. That's all there was to make Bill into the High Priest of
Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>
That's what qualified Bill to lecture everybody else about God,
&quot;Higher Powers&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Spirituality&quot;, and
recovery from alcoholism.<br>
That's what qualified Bill to lock the other alcoholics into contracts that
they couldn't &quot;wiggle out of.&quot;
</ul>

<p>
Then Bill Wilson actually criticized other people for exhibiting
&quot;foolishness&quot; like:<br>
<font color="#7f00cf">
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#freedom2think">How persistently
we claim the right</a> to decide all by ourselves just what we shall
think and just how we shall act.&quot;<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson was such an outrageous fascist autocrat that he actually demanded the power
to dictate how other people should act and think.
<p>

Lest there be any doubt about it, Bill Wilson later
wrote to Dr. Harry Tiebout that<br>
<font color="#7f00cf">
A.A. members are &quot;impersonally and severely disciplined

<li> &quot;He held something back in his Fifth Step.&quot;
<li> &quot;He isolated, and didn't go to enough meetings.&quot;
<li> &quot;He didn't <i>Turn It Over</i>.&quot;
<li> &quot;He didn't do enough recruiting for his faith to be 'vital'.&quot;
<li> &quot;He had a resentment.&quot;
<li> &quot;He didn't admit his powerlessness.&quot;
<li> &quot;He didn't make a complete surrender.&quot;

<li> &quot;He didn't <i>Work A Strong Program</i>.&quot;
