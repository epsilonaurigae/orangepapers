<p>
Hello Mr Orange,
<p>
Thanks for the reply.
<p>
Like I said opinions are like arseholes .....

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Graham,
<p>
Like I said, opinions are not all alike. Some are based on facts,
and some are based on prejudices or superstitions or irrational beliefs or misinformation.
</font>
<p>
You see or not, when I talk about being fucked in the head, it's because I
have the ability to laugh at myself.
<p>
<font color="blue">
When someone tells me that he is fucked in the head, what that means to me is that he is
fucked in the head, not that he doesn't take himself seriously.
<p>
Besides, you actually take yourself very seriously. You insist that your opinions and your beliefs
are the truth.
&quot;Not taking yourself seriously&quot; is just an act to cover up such
monumental arrogance that you think you have a hotline to God and &quot;the Big Answer&quot;.
</font>
<p>
You will have an answer for everything which is great for you,
but does not mean that much to me. What you think of me, is not my business
and vice-versa.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Which is relevant to what? That is another attempt at an illogical escape.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Fact don't mean much to me. I can't hear you.&quot;
</font>

</font>
<p>
You are obviously quite an intellectual and all I'm having with you, is some
fun. The Steps are numbered for the intellectual.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Fun? That is another standard A.A. dodge. I'm talking about quackery and medical malpractice
that kills people.  That isn't fun.
<p>
RE:
<font color="black">
&quot;The Steps are numbered for the intellectual.&quot;
</font><br>
That is another A.A. slogan, one that spreads the standard A.A. anti-intellectualism.
A.A. sure does have contempt for people with working brains.

</font>
<p>
How about telling me a bit about yourself.
<p>
Are you male or female? gay or straight? married, divorced, children, no
children, and so on ? Are you happy ? If so, I'm happy for you. Do you
believe in God ?
<p>
<font color="blue">
I've already written out the autobiographical information many times.<br>
Here is a list:
<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">Who Are You?</a>.<br>
Here is more:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#who_r_u" target="newwin159">How did you get to be where you are?</a>
<p>
I believe in &quot;God, as I understand It&quot;, but I do not believe in Santa Claus. I do not believe
that you can get a Big Ghost to grant your wishes just by getting down on your knees and begging.
The Jews in Auschwitz thoroughly disproved that one.
<p>
I expect God to help the Alcoholics Anonymous members just the same way as He helped the Jews in Auschwitz.

</font>
<p>
I have been married for 22 years have 2 sons 21 &amp; 23 and have never been in
a better space than I am in now. My search for God is over, I do not share
that with you
for you to now play psychiatrist but merely for your information. If I ask
for your advice, then you are entitled to give it. Rather tell me about
yourself and how you cope with
living. Please don't come from any higher ground, then we cannot
communicate. You are no better or worse than any other individual on this
planet.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is yet another attempt at an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">escape via relativism</a>.
People are not all equal. Their education and intelligence and opinions are not all equal either.
Nor are their grasps on reality.

</font>
<p>
In AA, I say that I choose my Psychopaths well, which means, I do not mix
with everybody there. I have a few friends that are alcoholics and we never
sit in judgement or try to fix
each other. We laugh at our insanities and communicate with each other about
our defects and assets. I firmly believe that our basic characters never
change.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You laugh at your insanities? How about the insane belief that an old pro-Nazi cult religion
from the nineteen-thirties will make you a good person and solve your problems?
</font>
<p>
I grant you the right to believe whatever you want to, grant that to others.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You can believe whatever you want to believe. You can even believe that the world is flat,
like the Hari Krishnas used to do. But you do not have the right to foist quackery and
superstition on sick people and lie to them and other people and say that it works great.

</font>
<p>
The three pertinent ideas in the Big Book, mean a lot to me. They are not
Bill Wilson, they are words
that one either accepts or rejects as one sees fit.
<ol>
<li>
Bill also said, that let us never be so vain as to think that AA is a
cure-all, even for alcoholism.
<li>
When we treat alcoholism as a matter of willpower and morality, people die.
<li>
When we treat it as a disease, people get better.
</ol>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<ol>
<li>
The first statement is just one of Bill Wilson's bait-and-switch tricks. While recruiting,
Bill Wilson made some statements that sounded enlightened and
open-minded, about how A.A. has no monopoly, and A.A. isn't &quot;the only way by which
faith may be acquired&quot;, but that was just P.R. fluff to fool the outsiders into
joining. After they joined, the story changed. That is
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">Deceptive Recruiting</a>,
and it's a bait-and-switch trick.
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
(Changing the goal from &quot;quit drinking&quot; to &quot;acquire faith&quot;
is another bait-and-switch trick.)
<p>
But then the story changed to:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<font color="black">

<p>
That is bullshit, and another one of Bill Wilson's bare-faced lies.
Show me the medical tests that prove that.  There are none.
What the doctors really say is:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The NIAAA's 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol dependence found in the DSM-IV, they found:
&quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab) programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And even an A.A. Trustee said:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;[It] doesn't hurt at the level of GSO for AA to have humility
and understand that 60 percent do it without AA.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font face="Times, Roman">
&#8212; Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant (AA Board Of Trustees Member, and author &quot;The Natural History of Alcoholism&quot;):
AA <i>Grapevine</i> magazine 5/2001
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Bill Wilson was contradicting his first point above. Bill Wilson switched to claiming that A.A. IS the only way.
<p>
The logic there is also totally twisted and backwards. You say that
<font color="black">
&quot;When we treat alcoholism as a matter of willpower and morality, people die.&quot;
</font>
But it is A.A. that treats alcohol abuse as an issue of morality.
Step Four is a <b><i>moral</i> inventory</b>. 
And Steps Five through Seven are about &quot;shortcomings&quot;, and &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;wrongs&quot;. A.A. claims that drinking alcohol is a moral shortcoming.

<p>
Now I know that A.A. also claims that &quot;alcoholism is a disease,
not a moral stigma&quot;, but that is just another bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">First, alcoholism is a disease to be cured,
and then it is a sin that must be removed by God</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;When we treat it as a disease, people get better.&quot;</font><br>
<p>
Again, this is bullshit. Show me the medical records. Show me the clinical trials where 
A.A. improved the alcoholics. There are none. In fact,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">A.A. has failed every properly-conducted test</a>.
<p>
Even Dr. George E. Vaillant, who loved A.A. so much
that he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous, found that A.A. failed to help
alcoholics. Dr. Vaillant spent the better part of twenty years treating alcoholics with A.A.,
and calling alcoholism a &quot;disease&quot;. Then,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">to prove that A.A. works,
he tracked his first 100 patients for eight years</a>.
After eight years of A.A. treatment, the results were 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66
still drinking. Dr. Vaillant summed up the results of A.A. treatment by writing:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After initial discharge, only five
patients in the Clinic sample <i>never</i> relapsed to alcoholic drinking,
and there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease.<br>
...<br>
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
...<br>
Once again, our results were no better than the natural history of the disorder.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i>, George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1983, pages 283-286.<br>
The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;The natural history of alcoholism&quot; means what usually happens to untreated alcoholics. You know,
&quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot;. But also many spontaneous recoveries where people heal themselves.

<p>
By the way, five out of a hundred is the natural spontaneous remission rate in alcoholism. That's
how many alcoholics will quit drinking all on their own, each year, without any treatment or help,
to save their own lives.
So the real A.A. cure rate  &#8212;  those alcoholics whom A.A. helped to get sober  &#8212;  was zero.
</ol>

</font>
<p>
Why all this obsession with the Oxford Group ?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Because the Alcoholics Anonymous religion IS the Oxford Group religion.
Bill Wilson just hijacked a branch of Dr. Frank Buchman's cult and made it into his own cult.
You and your fellow A.A. members are still parrotting the teachings of Dr. Frank Buchman,
and practicing his mind-bending recruiting and indoctrination techniques.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">The 12 Steps are nothing but the Oxford Group practices</a>.
Bill Wilson did not discover or invent anything. He just wrote down the Oxford Group practices.
(<i>Cult practices</i>, not &quot;spiritual principles&quot;.)

Chill out, the aggression must be killing you. As for the resentment .....

This arseholes opinion is that any disease of the emotions can only be
removed by God. Accept or reject, it works for me. I have suffered from more
than one disease and just recently
had another miracle. Accept or reject as you see fit, what you think for me,
does not matter, it's what I think that matters for me.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, so you have some screwy Buchmanite religious beliefs. Now you can see why the Oxford Group is relevant.
<p>
Most of the doctors and psychiatrists in this world will strongly dispute your 
belief that &quot;any disease of the emotions can only be removed by God.&quot;
<p>
By the way, if A.A. is really treating &quot;emotional illnesses&quot; with religion,
then A.A. is practicing medicine without a license. You A.A. members are not trained
psychiatrists, and you have no business treating mental illness.
<p>
And you are attempting to do some screwy faith healing.
A.A. has killed a lot of people that way, especially by telling mental patients
not to take their medications.
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Don't take medications, just trust the 12 Steps and God to heal you.&quot;</font>

<p>
Here in Portland, Oregon,
<a href="orange-letters265.html#Followers" target="_blank">another pair of parents
who are members of the Followers of Christ Church just got convicted of manslaughter</a>
for letting their baby die, rather than take the baby to a doctor,
because they only believe in faith healing.
I wonder when the courts will start convicting A.A. sponsors for such quackery.

I do not correspond with you with anything but wishes that you are happy and

answer about Bill Wilson or AA
that is going to change how I feel.
<p>
<font color="blue">
The autobiographical information is listed above.
<p>
And please don't worry about me. I am doing just fine. I have almost 11 years of sobriety now.
My 11th anniversary is less than two weeks away. The people to worry about are the sick
people who are getting sold Frank Buchman's and Bill Wilson's old cult religion as a quack
cure for alcohol abuse. Those poor people are dying.

If you come with all sorts of stories
from the history books then I guess that the communication will be over and
I believe that you will stop the correspondance
because you want to do it first.

That sounds like you will cut off communication if I tell the truth about the history of Alcoholics
Anonymous. That is typical cultish behavior.
We were just discussing,
<a href="orange-letters265.html#Anne_I" target="_blank">in a previous letter</a>,
how cutting off communication with critics is standard cult practice.
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of Scientology said,
if the criticism cannot be silenced, then the scientologist should cease all
communication with the critic, or &quot;disconnect&quot;.
(<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#disconnect" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
Just run away and avoid any further communication that might accidentally lodge a fact between
the believers' ears.

Should I persist in telling XA true-believers the truth about recovery even as they
resist?  I have been in contact with Kris Best who has written<br>

I gave her your web address but from her comments it is obvious she did not even
read the introduction.  I feel it is a waste of time unless she can see the truth
and publish her findings.

Hello again, Bob,
<p>
What I plan to do is, when I finally get around to answering her articles some rainy day,
I will send carbon copies of my letters to the newspaper's editor, and also print them here.
I don't expect anything like a fair hearing from her, and it is highly unlikely that she
would print any sensible rebuttal to her illogical rants.
But her editor might find a fair debate interesting. (I say <i>might</i>.)

Have a good day now.

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
Greetings,
<p>
I do not speak for AA but only of my own perceptions of the program. I have been a
sober member of the program for over 18 years and have observed a lot.
I believe that there are a number of misconceptions about the AA program
they are:
<ul>
<li>
1. AA is a treatment program..It is not . I personally and have known of many others
who have suggested that people look into going to Detox centres, Treatment
Centres, Marriage Councillors, Medical Doctors, Clergymen and Psychologists
whilst citing the inabilty of the AA program to deal with such matters in any
fashion.. As a sponsor of indivifuals from time to time I am fully aware that all I
can do is carry the message of sobriety and exhibit sobriety in my life. AA provides
a road map with common sense principles to live by.In this sense it is only a
suggested Maintenance Program. I don't believe that AA has ever gotten anyone sober
against their will. AA literature concedes that we only know a little.

<p>
<li>
2. AA is a religion or a Cult.... This is totally an error in perception.. I
attended a meeting recently where a fellow received a 5 year cake. He stated that he
was an atheist when he came into the program and that he was still an atheist. Many
members of AA share the Atheistic or Agnostic point of view and  have maintained
their sobriety over an extended period of time. No one is ever pressured into
believing anything.specific other than that alcohol  will take most of us down if we
don't get some sort of help in maintaining our sobriety. That help is always in the
form a power greater than ourselves otherwise we would handle it by ourselves. That
power can be the people in the program or our extended support network in and out of
the program. Admitting our faults is not a religious ritual. I once asked two of my
neighbors to help me fall a tree in my yard. I couldn't do it by myself... does that
make me a cultist??? I think not!!!! The
interesting thing is that many people who come into the program are affiliated with
a religious denomination. They are encouraged by virtue of step 11 to seek through
prayer and meditation to  increase their concious contact with God as they
understand him.

<p>
<li> 3.There is no prerequisite to join AA.. This is totally erroneous there most
certainly is!!! The alcoholic must have a desire to stop drinking or at least say
they do!!!  This is proclaimed in the 3rd Tradition. The program is of no value
whatsoever to those who really have no desire to quit entirely. This one point
skewes any attempt to quote statistics.  Nobody can know the true desire of an
individual. Many if not most AA members would not judge the true motives of
individuals. There are therfore no statistics in AA.True motives are privy to the
individual. A certain group will accept an individual on the basis of their
assertion that they have a desire to stop drinking. We do not give polygraph tests
nor  do we administer truth serum. We merely stay sober and try to carry the message
to those who are still suffering.
</ul>
<p>
Thanks for hearing me out.

Hello Bill,
<p>
Thank you for the input. Unfortunately, that is a lot of standard A.A. propaganda,
and quite untrue.

<p>
You began your letter with the standard A.A. doubletalk:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The A.A. oldtimers declare that they are not speaking for A.A., because nobody can speak for A.A.,
and then they declare how many years of sobriety
and A.A. membership they have, to establish their credentials to speak for A.A., and then they speak for
A.A. while saying that they aren't speaking for A.A.

<p>
Now, for your points:
<p>
<ol>

<p><li>
RE:

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now this statement is true. A.A. is quackery and superstition, not medical treatment.
But A.A. is used as a treatment program by most of the &quot;treatment centers&quot;
in this country, and A.A. does nothing to stop that. In fact, A.A. encourages it.
<p>
We were just discussing how Bill Wilson set up a 12-Step treatment center way back in 1940.
<a href="orange-letters261.html#Ray_S" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
For &quot;not being a treatment program&quot;, Bill Wilson was sure quick to make it one, and start
making money off of it. Bill published the <i>Big Book</i> in 1939, and set up the first
12-Step treatment center in 1940.
<p>
Also see
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
how Dr. George E. Vaillant used A.A. as treatment for almost 20 years</a>.
Then Dr. Vaillant was elected to the Board of Trustees of A.A.
<p>
In addition, the flip-flop about whether A.A. is &quot;treatment&quot; is just another standard
A.A. bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#not_treatment" target="_blank">First, A.A. is good treatment
for the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;, and then it isn't treatment at all.</a>

<p>
Wrong. It is not an error in perception. It is very clear perception.
A.A. passes the Cult Test with flying colors.
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.

<p>
Even an A.A. Trustee said that A.A. was a cult religion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...AA certainly functions as a cult and systematically
indoctrinates its members in ways common to cults the
world over.  ...in the absence of proven scientific
efficacy, critics are legitimate in suggesting that
mandated AA attendance may be criticized as a failure
of proper separation between church and state.&quot;<br>

The fact that you have some token atheists only shows that A.A. can have token Negroes just like
any other organization.

<p>
Well, the vast majority of people who recover from alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction really do handle it
themselves. In fact, they all do. A.A. doesn't work, and A.A. does not sober up &quot;millions&quot; of alcoholics.
A.A. cannot sober up anybody. Everybody has to do it for himself or herself.
The NIAAA's 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions
interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol dependence found
in the DSM-IV, they found:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do so without
seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab) programs and AA.
Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

And using a Group Of Drunks as your &quot;GOD&quot; (G.O.D. == Group Of Drunks)
is sheer insanity. Do you really believe that
you can get down on your knees and pray to a group of drunks and they will give you a Miracle?

Get real. People are sentenced to A.A. every day. And if the captive recruit doesn't please his sponsor
by parrotting the correct religious dogma, the sponsor sends a bad report to the court or parole officer,
which can send the victim to prison.

<p>
Bad analogy. Did you ask your neighbors to come over every Friday and Saturday night and hold your
hand to keep you from drinking?  I think not.
<p>
You imply that you got &quot;help&quot; from A.A., but what help?
<p>
<ul>
<li> How does declaring that you are powerless over alcohol make you quit drinking?

<li> How does declaring that your thinking is fucked and
you are insane, but a ghost will restore you to sanity help you to quit drinking?
<li>
How does going to meetings and confessing all of your &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
and &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;wrongs&quot; make you quit drinking?
<li>
How does begging a ghost or spirit or &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;
to remove your defects make you quit drinking?
<li>
How does going around and apologizing to everybody make you quit drinking?
<li>
How does conducting a s&eacute;ance and listening to the voices in your head make you quit drinking?
<li>
How does going around recruiting for A.A., and doling out the truth about
A.A. by
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">teaspoons, not buckets</a>&quot;,
 make people quit drinking?

</ul>
<p>
&quot;Not a cult&quot; indeed.

I don't know where you got that. I never said that there wasn't a prerequisite. And there is another
prerequisite that you didn't mention: gullibility and susceptibility to religious indoctrination.
<p>
Even back in 1960, Dr. Edgar H. Schein saw that Alcoholics Anonymous was a mind-control
or thought-reform program, and he saw what the prerequisites were.  Dr. Schein explained it so well:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Certain organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) do not
deliberately unfreeze an individual but refuse to take anyone under
their care who is not already unfrozen. Thus a person does not
become eligible for care by AA unless he has really become
desperate, is dissatisfied with himself, and is prepared to turn
his fate over to some greater power.<br>

<p>
That is illogical nonsense.  You are trying to claim that A.A. does not
produce success statistics because the &quot;true motives&quot; of the
A.A. members are what matter. That means that A.A. does not work, and
cannot make people quit drinking.  Only those people with the
&quot;correct motives&quot; will quit drinking, and then A.A. will
claim the undeserved credit for their sobriety.
<p>
And that's how it is. A.A. doesn't work at all. A few people who come
to A.A. just finally quit drinking by using their own will power and
intelligence and determination, in order to save their own lives and
stop the pain, and then A.A. steals the credit, while disavowing any
responsibility for the vast majority of A.A. newcomers who don't quit
drinking.
<p>
The fact that some of the successful people get brainwashed into believing
that A.A. saved their lives is not evidence that A.A. works, it is evidence
that A.A. is a cult.

Mister T,
<p>
When I first heard the slogan &quot;Your best thinking got you here&quot;  I was confused
because I was in an AA meeting at the time.  I later realized they meant my thinking
that  I could drink and drug safely was my best thinking which was wrong.  I now
know my belief that AA would help me was also stinkin'-thinkin'  and wrong.  This
just came to mind from a reference to that phrase in the forum.

Good point. Isn't it funny how there is a double standard there? If an A.A. newcomer thinks that A.A. dogma
is bullshit, the A.A. members say that is &quot;stinkin' thinkin'&quot;, and &quot;his addiction talking.&quot;
But if someone thinks that Bill Wilson's copy of Frank Buchman's cult religion is a Gift
From God, then that is proper thinking and &quot;sanity&quot;.
Yeh, right.

Hi &quot;Orange&quot;

<p>
In reply to your response to my previous letter
<a href="orange-letters265.html#Steve_S" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters265.html#Steve_S</a>

<p>
Thank you for your reply. The excommunication is broadly covered on the web. The
essence of the split was that the SGI posed a threat to the priesthood's control of
the Dai Gohonzon, and the SGI itself (and the funds it raised). I shall not enter
into the various ad hominem slanders suffice it to say that to promote the notion
that the Dai Gohonzon is somehow more &quot;powerful&quot; [as a mirror to our own Buddha
nature] than the Gohonzon in our homes, or the Gohonzon (i.e. Buddha Nature) that
exits within each human being's life (whether we recognise it or not), is a delusion
of colossal proportions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Steve,
<p>
So it was a fight over who got to own and chant to the oldest scroll? Incredible.
<p>
Yes, that is delusional magical thinking. I am sure that Buddha would have disapproved.
<p>
I can just see a Zen Buddhist master burning the scroll while asking, &quot;What were you idiots thinking?&quot;
</font>
<p>
Of course, nobody has the right to excommunicate anyone from their Buddha nature.
You may as well try to separate your form from your shadow. The Buddha never uttered
such nonsense &#8212; it certainly wasn't his &quot;thing&quot;. How could this enable people to end
their suffering?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I can't help but notice the parallels to what happened to Christianity. After existing for
several hundred years, Christianity had turned into an organization that excommunicated people, had
heresy trials, and burned girls at the stake as witches, and burned astronomers as heretics.

</font>
<p>
Although I profess no particular expertise or great experience in theological
matters, I will attempt to answer your further questions as a layman. An important
caveat however. Should your arguments be based upon a belief that the true nature of
existence (and non-existence) is limited to that which we have been able to measure
and observe under the scientific method, then there is little point in continuing.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
1.) Chanting for the happiness of others? How does that work? How can you sitting in
a room, chanting to a printed scroll, make other people happy?
</font>

<p>
By focussing ourselves in meditation we are able to remain mindful [of our mission
for happiness] when we engage with the world at large. Chanting activates our Buddha
nature. I could liken this to the fact that my appetite is activated when I think of
apple pie. Of course, you could ascribe this almost Pavlovian response to apple pie
to processes within the brain that we are just beginning to understand through
science. Of course chanting to enabling our Buddha nature, cannot so easily be
measured, but is nonetheless our way of realising (and actualising) that life
condition in our daily lives.

<p>
You may be expecting me to cite the &quot;Mystic Law&quot; and &quot;universal energies&quot; or some
such as the vehicle by which our chanting then actually makes people happy &#8212; This
mechanism is misunderstood by many as being something apart from ourselves. The
function of making people happy is fulfilled by us, as mere mortals &#8212; we are all
functions of &quot;the Mystic Law&quot; as it is referred to in the Lotus Sutra. So, to be
succinct &#8212; chanting and not &quot;acting&quot;, or getting off your backside, is pretty
pointless. Your question perhaps requires further qualification.

<p>
If you lock someone in a room, forever, then it is unlikely (but not impossible &#8212; 
our understanding of the universe is finite) their chanting will have any effect on
the outside world. Unless of course, it is known they are locked in there and
chanting for the happiness of others... in which case a connection is made to the
outside world &#8212; and other buddhists and non buddhists alike may act en-mas to
improve the world (and hopefully to release the prisoner)!

<p>
<font color="blue">
I can see some sense in the belief that to improve oneself is to improve the world.
Still, I find chanting for the happiness of others a stretch, and perhaps a bit of ego:
&quot;I'm so good that I chant for the happiness of others.&quot;

2.) Do you really believe that chanting to a printed scroll  &#8212;  the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;  &#8212;  will
get you things? Do you believe that the Gohonzon is able to grant wishes?
</font>

<p>
No. What use are wishes without action? Again, it is incorrect to believe the
Gohonzon is primarily there to fulfil material desires.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No joke.
</font>
<p>
To clarify by example. You are financially struggling, your boss won't promote you
and yet you really want a shiney BMW on your driveway. The motives behind this
desire are arguably base, and driven by the lower words of hunger (desire), anger
(desire to elevate oneself above the neighbours perhaps), animality (desire to get
&quot;chicks&quot;). Driven purely by these lower worlds you are unlikely to succeed!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Agreed.
<p>
In fact, in my experience, the chanting was dangerously close to black magic. Just chant a spell
to make the world give you whatever you wish: money, girl friend, better job, car, apartment,
furniture, whatever.
My group leader thought I was nuts when I talked about getting enlightenment.
Why do that when you can get the good stuff?

</font>
<p>
By chanting and activating your buddha nature, you realise that we are all equally
capable of buddhahood... You, me, even your boss who is being shitty to you. Your
buddha nature may give you the courage and compassion to actually engage with your
boss &#8212; perhaps ask him why is is so unhappy... maybe he opens up to you, revealing
his reasons. I won't continue with this fiction, but the essence of my argument is
that by revealing our Buddha nature, we make sincere connections which we would not
have otherwise made. The primary effect here is that you may help your boss in some
way (perhaps making him happier or encouraging him to overcome his challenges). The
secondary effect is that you may receive benefit from this connection &#8212; maybe he
trusts you more &#8212; maybe he looks upon you in a better light. Who knows what benefit
may come &#8212; if any. If you don't act, though, then it's a given you will remain
hungry, and angry for that BMW!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, but does chanting <i>Nam-myoho-renge-kyo</i> &quot;activate your Buddha nature?&quot;
That is a huge assumption.

</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
3.) You talked about not feeling guilty for failing to attend meetings. That implies
that somebody else does. Why the heck do you have to go to meetings at all? Does the
chanting not work if it is not done in groups?
</font>

<p>
The fact that I feel no guilt when missing SGI meetings implies nothing &#8212; I'm afraid
that is your own inference. When I say &quot;Any sense of guilt for not attending any
meetings, is truly self generated.&quot; I mean exactly that. Any sense of guilt can only
be self generated &#8212; the conditions to make people feel guilty for abstaining from
activities should NEVER exist. How can making a fellow member feel guilty, make them
happy?

<p>
We encourage people to attend (as I myself am encouraged), but this is in the true
sense of the word &quot;give support, confidence, or hope to (someone)&quot; &#8212; but no more
than you might encourage a friend to try a new food. Most definitely, this must not
to be confused with coercion, persuasion, to compel, or pressure, which I think are
words more fitting with your suggestion.

<p>
Dealing with the latter half of your question, we go to meetings to meet our
friends! Some people in the group we will love to be around &#8212; some may irritate us
intensely &#8212; but that's life :) We also use the meetings as a forum to discuss the
faith and philosophy and to seek guidance from our peers. There is the danger that
by practicing completely alone we will struggle to appreciate some of the more
subtle concepts covered in the writings. There is also the human tendency to begin
bending things to fit your own mind (e.g. today, I'll chant for a BMW), so the group
helps us to see when we might start losing the plot!

<p>
Chanting, as far as I have experienced, works equally well alone or in groups.
Again, it's natural for humans to do things in groups, and it is certainly a more
powerful experience to chant together. The primary focus of chanting is to help
people become happy and fulfil their potential, so I'm all for a more powerful
experience. The more I can connect with people on the profound level of their Buddha
nature, the better!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alas, I remain skeptical. There was a lot more going on at the meetings that I attended.
Like subtle pressure to conform and believe in their superstitions.
They were constantly selling the practice: &quot;Just try it. Just chant for 30 days, and if it
doesn't work for you, we will all quit.&quot;
They didn't quit when I did.

</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
4.) Do you believe that chanting the name of a book will make you absorb the wisdom
that is in the book?
</font>

<p>
It's interesting that you use the word &quot;wisdom&quot; and not information or knowledge. If
only it were that easy, I could chant Bible! Bible! Bible! over and over but I doubt
I would make a very convincing Christian.

<p>
Chanting daimoku &#8212; Nam Myoho Renge Kyo &#8212; is our primary practice. It is a matter of
faith that by chanting daimoku that we naturally activate our Buddha nature. You are
asking if someone who had never heard the mantra and then chanted it without knowing
where it came from or what it meant, would ever become wise... Not in my view. Would
it change their life in some way for the better? Yes. That's my belief. Don't ask me
about the mechanism &#8212; there is no scientific basis, and I refer to my initial caveat
before we go down the tooth fairy argument.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes, that is the key question, isn't it? Does it actually work?
<p>
And work to do what, exactly?
Phrases like &quot;activate your Buddha-nature&quot; are so vague and high-falutin'
 that they could mean anything.

</font>
<p>
The fundamentals of Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism are Faith, Practice and Study.
Without all three one is unlikely to fully actualise their Buddhahood in daily life.
Personally I still haven't read all 28 chapters of the Lotus Sutra. I read many
treatises and commentaries, though, and by having done so I have deepened my
understanding and faith in Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, and I hope thereby in doing so have
manifest greater wisdom in my daily life.

<p>
5.) Orange (great name by the way) I really have to smile at your final question.
What a fantastical proposition. This is the most important question of all. My brief
answer? Yes!

<p>
<font color="blue">
[Readers: the last question was whether having one third of the world chanting would
produce world peace.]

</font>
<p>
We are currently lead by people who's primary concern is holding onto power. We have
war, starvation, and suffering on a scale never before known. I use the word &quot;lead&quot;
and not &quot;ruled by&quot; as we vote these people in, or allow them to continue dictating
how we live. The recent uprisings in the arab world are symptomatic of the people's
desire for leaders that will lead them to happiness and not further suffering.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I quite agree there.
</font>
<p>
If we were lead (not ruled) by Buddha's (i.e. people who were genuinely awakened to
their Buddha nature, and act for the genuine happiness of all human beings) then the
world cannot fail to know peace. While greed, anger and foolishness continue to
dominate our world, this goal will never be attained while we remain dazzled by the
impermanent shiney things in life. Only when the world truly respects and honours
the sanctity of human life, and truly works to eliminate the sufferings of others
will a profound happiness occur.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sounds good. But will that glorious day ever come? Most of Buddha's teachings said &quot;no&quot;.
Buddha said that suffering would never end, and this world would never become Paradise.

</font>
<p>
What do we mean by happiness? now that's a question that would take much longer to
answer!

<p>
Have a great week!

<p>
<font color="blue">
You have a good day too.
