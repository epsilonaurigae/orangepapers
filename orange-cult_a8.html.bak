<i>Hypocrisy</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
A.A. is extremely hypocritical.
<ul>
<li> A.A. claims that it is only a spiritual program, not a religion,
and then...
<ul>
<li> A.A. does everything in its power to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">convert people to its
religious beliefs</a>.
<li> A.A. members accuse the mainstream churches of being &quot;unspiritual&quot;
because they are
&quot;<a href="orange-letters10.html#hypocritical" target="_blank">into property,
authority figures (priests), pomp and serimony</a>&quot; [<i>sic.</i>],
<li> A.A. members declare that &quot;<a href="orange-letters10.html#religion_shackle" target="_blank">religion
is a shackle...; spirituality does
indeed free us to make connection with the Living God</a>.&quot;
<li> Hazelden propaganda even tells people to
&quot;<a href="orange-spirrel.html#undercut" target="_blank">set their religion aside</a>&quot;
and just do the practices of Alcoholics Anonymous in order to get &quot;spirituality&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
<li> A.A. claims that it is a &quot;spiritual&quot;
program of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; while it:<br>
<ul>
<li> lies (with qualifiers) about its failure rate:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;
</font>

<li> tells members to <i>&quot;Act As If&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;Fake It Until
You Make It.&quot;</i>

<li> routinely pulls a large number of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch stunts</a> on new members.
<li> lies about what it is and what it does. (See the file on
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">The 12 Biggest Falsehoods of A.A.</a> for the details.)

<li> practices
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a> and lies to newcomers
about what membership in the program really entails.
<li> lies about
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">its history</a>,
and covers up every fault and shortcoming of the organization and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">its founders</a>.
<li> And now Susan Cheever reports that the A.A. headquarters staff is even
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#Cheever5" target="_blank">excising embarrasing information</a>
about Bill Wilson's philandering from the official A.A. historical archives.
(Destroying the evidence.)
</ul>

<p>
<li> Bill Wilson talked constantly about &quot;moral inventories&quot;, &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;,
&quot;spirituality&quot;, and &quot;unselfish, constructive action&quot;,
while Bill's behavior was the extreme of unethical, immoral, and selfish:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">
Bill stole all of the money he could</a> from the fledgeling Alcoholics
Anonymous organization, and then
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#copyright_certificate" target="_blank">he stole the copyright
of the <i>Big Book</i></a>, and then, with that copyright,
he blackmailed the A.A. organization into supporting him in comfort for
the rest of his life. They even bought him a Cadillac car and a house
in the country.
<li> <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">Bill acted as a sexual predator</a>
and took advantage of the pretty young women
who came to A.A. seeking help with alcoholism.
<li> Bill lectured others about overcoming addictions
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">while he smoked himself to death
and insisted that it was okay</a>.
<li> Bill lied constantly about everything from
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">his own history</a>
to the history of Alcoholics Anonymous to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the failure rate of the A.A. program</a>.
<li> Bill advertised Alcoholics Anonymous as a universalist organization where all
faiths and beliefs are welcome, where unconditional love and complete acceptance are
the practice, but
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">Bill ostracized and abandoned
to death by alcohol</a>
a fellow who refused to convert to Bill's religious beliefs.
<li> Bill Wilson's behavior was completely hypocritical.
</ul>

<p>
<li> Likewise, even today, the Alcoholics Anonymous organization will not tell
the truth about its history, or Bill Wilson. It keeps the archives of historical
documents locked and sealed, and not available to any investigators.
They wouldn't even let ABC News or NBC News look at the archives.
That is the official A.A. idea of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;.

<p>
<li> Speaking of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;, the leaders of A.A. at
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc. have committed perjury in the courts
of both Mexico and Germany to stop other A.A. members from printing and giving away
(or selling extremely inexpensively) copies of the old out-of-copyright
editions of the <i>Big Book</i>.
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">See the write-ups of the story</a>.

<p>
<li> And then Bill Wilson criticized alcoholics who rationalize and minimize their
drinking by writing:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you draw this fallacious reasoning to the attention of an alcoholic,
he will laugh it off, or become irritated and refuse to talk.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 2, &quot;There Is A Solution&quot;, page 23.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But Bill didn't bother to mention that A.A. members
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">act that way</a> whenever
you point out the flaws of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<li> The most amusing example of Bill Wilson's hypocritical &quot;rigorous
honesty&quot; has to be his lecture in the <i>Big Book</i> that tells us good old boys
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Bill_philandering" target="_blank">how to cheat on
your wife and not tell her about it</a>.
Bill declared that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The husband begins to feel lonely, sorry for himself.
He commences to look around in night clubs, or their equivalent,
for something more than liquor.
Perhaps he is having a secret and exciting affair with
&quot;the girl who understands.&quot; &nbsp; ... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If we are sure our wife does not know, should
we tell her?
Not always, we think. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our design for living is not a one-way street.
It is as good for
the wife as for the husband. If we can forget, so can she.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson,
pages 81-82.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Yeh, honey, you should just forget about
whats-her-name. I already have &#8212; I'm not screwing her any more.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">I've got two other cuties now</a>.&quot;</font>)
<p>
And right after that,
<font color="#bf0000"><i>on the next page</i></font>, he wrote:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The spiritual life is not a theory. <i>We have to live it.</i>
... We should not talk incessantly to them about spiritual matters.
They will change in time. Our behavior will convince them more than
our words.&quot;<br>

<p>

<p>
<li> A.A. accuses competing recovery programs of killing alcoholics even though
A.A. World Services trustee Prof. George Vaillant found that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. actually
had the highest death rate of any of the treatment programs that he studied</a>.
<p>
<a name="selfishness"> </a>
<li> Bill Wilson constantly lectured A.A. members about &quot;selfishness&quot;
and &quot;self-centeredness&quot;,
and said that they must be rid of it.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Selfishness, self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our
troubles. &nbsp; ...<br>
Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or
it kills us!<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, Chapter 5,
<i>How It Works</i>, page 62.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The talk about getting rid of selfishness is hypocritical.
A.A. is actually an enormously selfish program.
Everything in the A.A. program is about <i>&quot;my sobriety&quot;</i>.
The <i>Big Book</i> actually teaches A.A. members that
<a href="orange-recruit.html#marriage_counselor" target="_blank">wives and families are expendable</a>
in the pursuit of sobriety.
<p>
A.A. members go recruiting, getting new converts
(which Bill called &quot;helping others&quot;),
because they are taught that they will lose their
sobriety &#8212; they will relapse and die drunk &#8212; if they don't spend all
of their spare time recruiting for Alcoholics Anonymous.
So they are doing it for themselves. In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill taught
the recruiters:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Outline the program of action, explaining how you made a self-appraisal,
how you straightened out your past and why you are now endeavoring to be
helpful to him. It is important for him to realize that your attempt
to pass this on to him plays a vital part in your recovery. Actually,
he may be helping you more than you are helping him.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 94.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<!-- a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" -->
<a href="orange-recruit.html#sponsor_benefits" target="_blank">
Recent research has even shown that to be true</a> &#8212; that the sponsors benefited from
being in a sponsor-sponsee relationship, while the sponsored newcomers did not.
So the sponsorship system was only helping the old-timers.

<p>
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous Tradition Eleven says,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;Our public relations should be guided by the principle of
<font color="#9F0000">attraction rather than promotion</font>;
we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level
of press, radio, and films.&quot;</b></font><br>
But A.A. has always been conducting a promotion campaign, since the very first days.
In the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
Bill Wilson calls missionary work to distant cities and countries
&quot;pioneering&quot;, and says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Pioneering in A.A. of course has not stopped. I hope it never will.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 80.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The worst promotion of A.A. is the coercive recruiting.
A.A. routinely encourages judges, parole officers, counselors and therapists
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coerced_attendance" target="_blank">
to force people to go to A.A. meeings to &quot;to get help.&quot;</a>
(Often, the counselors and therapists are themselves members of A.A. or N.A..)
And then the A.A. boosters deny any responsibility, and say that they don't
force anyone to do anything.
<p>
See the cult test item on
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank"><i>Aggressive Recruiting</i></a> for more.

<p>
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous Tradition Eleven also demands anonymity.
Bill Wilson told one story of humble anonymity:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The kind of sacrifice that we shall always need to make is beautifully illustrated
by a talk I recently had with a certain Texas lady.
Her temptation was extreme because she is in show business and has great
national popularity as an entertainer. This is what she told me:
&quot;I sing in the best barrooms only, and I have been doing it for fifteen
years. Within a year after joining A.A., I lost about ten pounds, the bags came
out from under my eyes, and I began to feel like a human being. My manager
couldn't figure it out, but at last I told him what had happened to me.
At once, he said, 'But aren't you and I going to tell the public about this?
Why, this would make terrific publicity, both for A.A. and you too.'
'Well,' I said, 'temporarily I know that it would. Other people have proved
that. But, please, not for me. Alcoholics Anonymous has a principle called
anonymity &#8212; no public big shots allowed.
We all know that A.A. can't be run like show business, no matter what the
short-term benefits may be. A.A. saved my life and my career. Therefore the
future welfare of Alcoholics Anonymous is more important to me than any
publicity that I could get as an A.A. member.'&quot;
Then a little wistfully she added, &quot;You know, Bill, I often see drunks
in my audience and wonder how I can help them. If only I could tell them from
the stage that I am in A.A. But that would only be temporary, wouldn't it?
In the long run, we'd all be ruined if everybody did it.&quot;
I looked at the lady from Texas and was glad, very glad.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 135.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No public big shots allowed, except for Bill Wilson and Marty Mann, who
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">constantly broke their anonymity</a>
while promoting Alcoholics Anonymous, which they did for many years.
They even went and
<a href="orange-Bill_Senate.html" target="_blank">testified before Congress</a>,
identifying themselves as members of Alcoholics
Anonymous. Bill even revealed that he was a cofounder and then bragged about all
of the great things that his organization had accomplished with alcoholics.
Bill Wilson spent most all of the nineteen-forties on the road, touring the country,
grandstanding and promoting Alcoholics Anonymous and breaking his anonymity.
By 1944, Bill Wilson was the most famous anonymous person in America.

</font>

</font></td></tr>

<p>

And yet Bill Wilson wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We simply could not afford to take the chance of letting self-appointed members
present themselves as messiahs representing A.A. before the whole public.
The promoter instinct in us might be our undoing. If even one such person
publicly got drunk or was lured into using A.A.'s name for his own purposes,
the damage might be irreparable. At this altitude (press, radio, films, and
television), anonymity &#8212; <i>100 per cent anonymity</i> &#8212; was the only possible
answer. Here principles would have to come before personalities, without exception.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 134.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>100 per cent anonymity</i>, without exception</font>,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">except for Bill Wilson</a>, of course...<br>
<font color="blue">
That way, there could be no leader besides Bill Wilson.
No one else could grow in fame and influence and come to rival Bill's leadership role
(which Henry Parkhurst called &quot;<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Poohbah" target="_blank">The
Grand Poohbah of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>&quot;).</font>

<p>
<li> And, speaking of traditions, Tradition Nine says,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;A.A., as such, ought never be organized...&quot;</b></font>,<br>
but A.A. is completely organized, with a national headquarters, a Board of Trustees,
Executives, committees, a national Council,
and it is legally incorporated into two corporations &#8212; the G.S.O. and A.A.W.S.,
and they have several million dollars stashed away in the bank.
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">
They are even committing felony perjury in the courts of Germany and
Mexico to make more money</a>.
<p>
That is in spite of Bill Wilson's statement that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Then our Trustees wrote a bright page of A.A. history.
They declared for the principle that A.A. must always stay poor.
Reasonable running expenses plus a prudent reserve would henceforth be the
Foundation's financial policy.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 114.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Rockefeller_02"> </a>
<li> The Seventh Tradition says that every A.A. group ought to be self-supporting,
declining outside contributions, but Bill Wilson gleefully took an outside contribution &#8212;
a stipend from John D. Rockefeller Jr. &#8212; to support himself.

<p>
<li> And Bill Wilson wrote of himself:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Because I myself have always had strong tendencies toward the pursuit of prestige,
wealth, and power, all of A.A.'s Traditions have borne down on me with great force.
You will remember
<a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html" target="_blank">the episode back in our living room on Clinton Street</a>.
That was the time when my group told me I could never become an A.A. professional.
With nearly every Tradition much the same thing has happened. At first,
I obeyed because I had to; I would have lost my standing in A.A. if I had not.
After a while I began to obey because I saw that the Traditions were wise and right.
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, pages 135-136.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Everything beyond Bill's confession that he compulsively pursued
prestige, wealth, and power is lies:
<ul>
<li>
Bill Wilson was nothing but an A.A. professional &#8212;
<ol>
<li> Bill lived off of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he was a professional
A.A. promoter. Alcoholics Anonymous supported Bill in comfort for the
rest of his life, and he never worked a straight job again.
A.A. even bought Bill a house in the country and a Cadillac car.
<li> And Bill died rich because of the royalites that
he got from the <i>Big Book</i> and his other books published by AAWS.
<li>
<a href="orange-traditions.html" target="_blank">The Traditions</a>
didn't stop Bill from coldly using A.A. for his pursuit of fame, prestige, power,
sex, and wealth.
</ol>
<li>
And the Traditions didn't stop Bill from breaking his anonymity constantly. Bill didn't
obey the Traditions at all.
<li>
And Bill did not lose his standing in A.A., either.
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue">
And note the funny
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_denial" target="_blank">reversal of reality</a>:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;At first, I obeyed because I had to... With nearly every Tradition...
I saw that the Traditions were wise and right.&quot;</i></font><br>
That is just the opposite of the truth. Bill wrote
<a href="orange-traditions.html" target="_blank">those traditions</a>,
and then he spent years selling them to the other A.A. members, who didn't want them and
voted against them at first. And then Bill
made it sound like the Traditions had somehow just been dropped on him
from Heaven or Mars or somewhere, and Bill declared that he was amazed to see how
&quot;right and wise&quot; they were...
</font>

<p>
<li> Finally, A.A. propaganda says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>Honesty, Openness, and Willingness</b><br>
Alcoholics Anonymous can only be effective if the individual is committed to
working the program in the spirit of honesty, openness, and willingness.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholic Thinking: Language, Culture, and
Belief in Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Danny M. Wilcox, page 95.</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is immensely, outrageously, hypocritical.
<p>
Oh, and just to put the frosting on the cake, Hazelden gives us this meditation thought
for the day:
<p>

A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Alcoholics Anonymous says <i>&quot;A.A. is the best, 'the time-tested
and proven', way to recovery&quot;</i>, when A.A. actually has
effectively
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">a 100% failure rate</a>.
<p>
<li>
A.A. says that it is a &quot;spiritual&quot; program that teaches &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;
(<i>Big Book</i> page 58),
but it actually teaches just the opposite. A.A. teaches people to be evasive and dishonest:
<ol>
<li> A.A. practices
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>,
coercive recruiting, and pulls many
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">bait-and-switch stunts</a> on the
newcomers.
<li>
Also, A.A. is extremely dishonest and lies about many things:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">its success rate</a>,
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">its history</a>,
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">its religious dogma</a>, and even
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">its current behavior</a>.
<li>
A.A. keeps its historical archives locked and sealed, and will not allow access to
anyone except a few very pro-A.A. writers.
Basically, anyone who will tell the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous cannot see the archives.
That includes the NBC and ABC news teams.
<li>
A.A. true believers actually act like you are being unfair if you tell the truth about the Alcoholics Anonymous
failure rate, dropout rate, suicide rate, or fascist cult religion history.
</ol>

<p>
<li>
A.A. claims that it frees people from guilt, but it actually induces even more guilt
by making people list and confess all of their sins, wrongs, &quot;defects of character&quot;,
and moral shortcomings in Steps 4 and 5. Then A.A. does it again with Steps 8 and 9
where people must list all of the people they ever wronged, hurt or offended, and
go &quot;make amends&quot; to them.


<p>
<li> Then A.A. teaches people to ignore and deny their own feelings. The slogan is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Feelings aren't facts!&quot;
</font>

<p>
<li>
A.A. enthusiasts claim that the A.A. program gets rid of ego and
self-seeking, but A.A. is actually enormously egotistical. A.A. members
imagine that they get miracles from God and have God waiting on them
hand and foot (like, God makes them quit drinking and doping, and takes
care of their wills and their lives for them), even though God ignores
other people who are desperate for a miracle, like the people who were
trapped at the top of the World Trade Center on the morning of September
11, 2001. They were certainly praying for a miracle, but they didn't get
one, did they?<br>
So what makes God care so much about alcoholics?<br>
Why do the alcoholics rate so much higher in God's Great Plan than other people?<br>
(Ego, ego, ego.)
<p>
<li>
Likewise, while A.A. claims to be a &quot;spiritual&quot; organization,
the A.A. leaders
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">commit perjury in the courts of
Mexico and Germany</a> to put innocent A.A. members
in prison for the &quot;crime&quot; of printing and giving away or selling very cheaply
copies of the old, out-of-copyright first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>
to poor alcoholics, including those in prison.

<p>
<li>
And everybody is reenacting <i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i> &#8212;
pretending to be getting great spiritual benefits from working the program
&#8212; just doing the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#pseudo_intellectual" target="_blank"><i>Fake It Until You Make It</i></a>
and 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#pseudo_intellectual" target="_blank"><i>Act As If</i></a> routines.
<p>
<li> A.A. claims that it is just a nice little neighborhood self-help group,
while it actually practices coercive recruiting,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Little_Red_Book" target="_blank">using the criminal
justice system</a> to force more people to attend the church services that it
calls &quot;meetings&quot;.
<p>
<li> A.A. claims to have the best knowledge and information about
alcoholism and recovery, but the A.A. &quot;recovery program&quot; is
really nothing but a
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">recycled old cult religion</a> from
the nineteen-thirties &#8212; the Oxford Group:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>

If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit

There is no disease

American Psychiatric Association, which <i>&quot;only a

But this is the dogma, one of the core beliefs, upon which
Alcoholics Anonymous is based.
A.A. teaches that you can't just quit drinking. You <i>must</i>
join A.A., do the Twelve Steps, and have a
&quot;spiritual experience&quot;, in order to quit drinking.

<p>
Actually, <i>most</i> of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">do
it without the aid of Alcoholics Anonymous</a> or its &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
so alcohol is not too much for them.

<p>
<li> Bill Wilson demanded that his followers
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">give up
their rational, thinking minds, human intelligence, and 'Reason'</a>,
and just <i>'have faith'</i>.
And
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">his grandiose proclamations
about alcoholism, A.A., and God</a> that he wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>
and &quot;<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>&quot; are
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality" target="_blank">totally irrational</a>.
And Bill was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">seriously mentally ill</a>,
and under the care of
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">a psychiatrist</a>.
And yet, Bill Wilson accused <i>all other</i> alcoholics of being irrational and insane.
(That's psychological projection, again.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Few indeed are the practicing alcoholics who have any idea how irrational they
are, or seeing their irrationality, can bear to face it.
Some will be willing to term themselves &quot;problem drinkers,&quot;
but cannot endure the suggestion that they are in fact mentally ill.
... no alcoholic ... can claim 'soundness of mind' for himself.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, pages 108-109.</font>

<p>
Well, Bill Wilson certainly couldn't claim any 'soundness of mind' for himself,
but not all alcoholics are in such bad shape.

<p>
<a name="Tiebout_reversal"> </a>
<li>
Bill Wilson's psychiatrist,
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry M. Tiebout</a>, who was the first psychiatrist to become
an enthusiastic promoter of Alcoholics Anonymous, wrote this reversal of reality:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unconcerned with causes and not bewitched by dogma, the A.A. program was
designed to get the individual to stop drinking, and really nothing else.<br>

<font size="-1">
== Harry M. Tiebout, M.D., in
<a href="orange-Tiebout-direct-treat.html" target="_blank"><i>DIRECT TREATMENT OF A SYMPTOM</i></a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Tiebout wrote that nonsense in spite of his patient Bill Wilson
constantly raving about God and spirituality and declaring that
Alcoholics Anonymous was an
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#acquire_faith" target="_blank">acquire faith</a>&quot; program,
and that
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">all atheists and agnostics had to start believing in Bill's religion</a>,
and that the real result of the Alcholics Anonymous program
was to make the newcomers &quot;<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#love_God" target="_blank">love God and call Him by name</a>&quot;,
and that
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Our real purpose is to make ourselves of maximum use to God&quot;</i></font>.
(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, page 77.)
<p>
Furthermore, Alcoholics Anonymous was not &quot;designed&quot; at all.
Bill Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith, and Clarence Snyder simply stole the
alcoholics' branch of Dr. Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult religion
and renamed it to &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;. A.A. is what
Dr. Frank Buchman made it &#8212; an oppressive arrogant guilt-inducing
cult religion that is very preoccupied with dogma.

<p>
<li>
In chapter four of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson's sermons about
faith versus logic and human intelligence were a reversal of reality &#8212;
rational thinking, reason, skepticism, and
agnosticism were labeled illogical, perverse,
cynical, vain, biased, mushy, and unreasoningly prejudiced, while
blind faith
<font color="#9F0000"><i>in Bill Wilson's religious beliefs</i></font>
was described as
logical, intelligent, reasonable, sane, honest, and
open-minded:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe
that our human intelligence was the last word... Rather vain of us,
wasn't it?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,
even against organized religion. ...
People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>We Agnostics</i>, page 49.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some of us had already walked far over the Bridge
of Reason toward the desired shore of faith. The outlines and the
promise of the New Land had brought lustre to tired eyes and fresh
courage to flagging spirits.
Friendly hands stretched out in welcome. We were grateful that Reason
had brought us so far. But somehow, we couldn't quite step ashore.
Perhaps we had been leaning too heavily on Reason that last mile and
did not like to lose our support.<br>

<p>
<a name="psych_sound"> </a>
<li>
An official A.A. history book quoted A.A. co-founder Doctor Bob as saying:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He said, &quot;Duke, I think this A.A. program will appeal to you, because it's
psychologically sound and religiously sane.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 1980, page 253.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That statement is the exact opposite of the truth:
<ul>
<li> A.A. is not psychologically sound at all. It is not based on psychology or
any science at all.
A.A. is based on superstitions &#8212; the Oxford Group cult religion,
and gross misconceptions about how the human mind and alcoholism
actually work.
A.A. is
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality" target="_blank">completely irrational and unscientific</a>,
and even brags about it.
<li> And A.A. is religiously insane &#8212; it is just
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's discredited old fascist cult religion</a>
with a new coat of paint on it.
<li> As you have just seen in the quotes above, the A.A. founder Bill Wilson exhorted
newcomers to give up their rational, thinking minds and become mindless giggling insane fools
who just &quot;had faith&quot; in Bill Wilson and his religion.
</ul>
<p>
And still, A.A. prints and distributes large quantities of propaganda that
claims just the opposite. That's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">the Big Lie technique</a>.

<p>
<a name="micro_managing"> </a>
<li>
A.A. pretends to offer newcomers complete religious freedom, when in fact
the Twelve-Step program cannot work unless God conforms to the A.A. standards.
You <i>cannot</i> just choose any old
&quot;Higher Power&quot; of your liking and still expect the Twelve Steps to work.
Your &quot;Higher Power&quot; must be a meddling, micro-managing,
wish-granting servant who waits on you hand and
foot and delivers miracles on demand.
In A.A., your Higher Power <font color="#9F0000"><i>must</i></font> do the following for you:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Restore you to sanity in Step Two,
<font color="#9F0000">or else you stay insane</font>.
<li> Take care of your will and your life for you in Step Three,
<font color="#9F0000">or else your unmanageable life stays unmanaged</font>.
<li> Listen to your confessions in Step Five,
and soften His vindictive attitude towards you,
<font color="#9F0000">or else God will continue to torture you with alcoholism.</font>
<li> Remove all of your sins, moral shortcomings, and defects of character,
<i>especially your desire to drink alcohol</i>, in Step Seven,
<font color="#9F0000">or else you continue to drink</font>.
<li> Talk to you and teach you in Step Eleven while you conduct a s&eacute;ance and
&quot;channel&quot; your Higher Power, and then give you work orders
and the power to go do the work,
<font color="#9F0000">or else you remain ignorant and don't know what to do with yourself</font>.
</ol>
<p>
If your Higher Power isn't the kind of deity who will work for you
and do all of that stuff for you then the Twelve Steps cannot possibly
work correctly. So much for &quot;any Higher Power of your
choosing.&quot;
<p>
<li>
A.A. boosters denounce the regular mainstream religions for being
&quot;shame-based&quot; and guilt-inducing, when that is actually
the way that Alcoholics Anonymous works:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I Truly do believe that the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous could
be viewed as the most important single event of the Twentieth Century.
That is because
the twelve step recovery program has not only proven
such a literal life saver for millions of people, but it also provided
a formula for countless individuals to learn how to live life based upon
spiritual principles that align with the metaphysical laws that actually
govern the experience of being human &#8212; instead of the twisted black and
white beliefs of shame based organized religion.<br>

<p>
But it is Alcoholics Anonymous that tells people to make long lists of every sin
and crime that they ever committed, and to confess it all to Man and God in
Steps 4 and 5. Not even the Catholic Church does that.
And in the Catholic Church, confessions are made to an ordained Priest who is
sworn to secrecy in a sacred oath. In Alcoholics Anonymous, sponsors are free to
blab Fifth-Step confessions (and they do).

<p>
There are also two other obvious reversals of reality there:
<ol>
<li> The writer claims that
A.A. has a great program that has saved the lives of millions of people,
when in fact <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the
program doesn't work at all</a>, and &quot;The Program&quot; has saved
very few, if any, lives. A.A. has a higher death rate than success rate.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. kills more
people than it saves</a>. The &quot;founding&quot; of that
harmful quackery is hardly &quot;the most important single event of the
Twentieth Century&quot;.

<p>
<li> The writer claims that A.A. gives people &quot;spiritual principles&quot;,
 when in fact it only gives them
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">the occult practices of an old cult religion</a>.
</ol>

<p><li>
The A.A. cult proselytizer Terence Gorski likewise reverses reality here:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In most Twelve Step literature, the addictive self is called the &quot;ego.&quot;
Whenever I hear or read the word <i>ego</i>, I substitute the words
<i>addictive self</i>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The goal of a Fourth Step is to deflate the ego &#8212; or, in other words,
to deflate the addictive self. The addictive self is marked by
grandiosity (addicted people feel that they are more than or better
than everyone else) and self-centeredness (they believe that they
are the center of the universe and there is little room left for
anyone or anything else).<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Understanding the Twelve Steps</i>, Terence T. Gorski, page 81.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alcoholics do not all exhibit grandiosity and think that they are the center of the Universe.
Cult members do, when they declare that God is answering their prayers and granting their
wishes because they are so &quot;spiritual&quot; and &quot;in constant contact with God&quot;.

<li> See the web page on
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Propaganda Techniques</i></a>

<p>
<li> And see Bill Wilson's grandiose claims that
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#thousands_died" target="_blank">thousands of alcoholics
would have died</a> if Bill had grandstanded and been a publicity-hound
megalomaniac and broken his anonymity (like he did).

<i>Seeing Through Tinted Lenses</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
A.A. true believers have a bad case of seeing the world through rose-colored
glasses, or some kind of strange color of lens:
<p>
<ul>
<li> They see relapsers as proof that failure to work the 12 steps correctly
will result in relapse. They never see relapsers as proof of the fact that
the 12 steps don't actually work.
<p>
<li> A.A. judges people on the
basis of their drug and alcohol consumption or abstention, and, essentially,
declares that the worth of a man can be measured in sober time.
Visiting old-timers with 20 years or more of sobriety are treated like royalty.
<p>
<li> A.A. judges people on how well they parrot the standard
dogma and beliefs (in spite of their claims of being non-judgemental and
offering newcomers complete acceptance).
<p>
<li>
One blatant example of seeing through tinted lenses is this story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An A.A. sponsor was hitting on a newcomer, trying to get another sponsee.
They discussed how the newcomer had quit drinking. The newcomer explained
that he had not gone into D.T.'s when he quit drinking because he had
been slowly tapered off of alcohol &#8212; being so sick, broke, unemployed,
down and out, that he could buy neither food nor much alcohol for months.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The sponsor remarked, &quot;Isn't it wonderful how our Higher Power
arranges things like that?&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That sponsor could not see the obvious truth that there are easier and
healthier ways to detox than months of starvation and malnutrition
(which creates a great danger of <i>Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</i>),
and that a &quot;Higher Power&quot; who really wishes to arrange events
to make life easier for us could have just not made us born
alcoholics in the first place.

This is obvious. A.A. flat-out says that you won't be able to
stay clean and sober without A.A. or another 12-Step organization like
Narcotics Anonymous. They say that you will relapse if you don't continue going to
meetings for the rest of your life.
They say that your choice is A.A. forever or dying drunk in a gutter.
(They use the <a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank"><i>Either/Or</i></a>

<ul>
<li>
The Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;First Tradition&quot; declares that the

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

common welfare comes first. But individual welfare follows close afterward.

see that by keeping people at a distance I also keep God at
a distance. God is nearer to me than I think and I can
experience Him by loving people and allowing people to love
me. But I can neither love nor be loved if I allow my secrets
to get in the way.<br>

<i>Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
In the <i>Big Book</i>, an A.A. member says of a non-member:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You poor guy. I feel so sorry for you. You're not an alcoholic.
You can never know the pure joy of recovering within the Fellowship of
Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 334.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Devaluing the outsider includes name-calling.
A.A. members often call outsiders things like &quot;normies&quot;,
&quot;flatlanders&quot;, &quot;pigeons&quot;, and &quot;A.A.-bashers&quot;.
<p>
A.A. has a bad case of the <i>&quot;Us versus Them&quot;</i> mindset:
<ul>
<li> &quot;Normies&quot; don't understand.
<li> &quot;Regular people&quot; don't know.
<li> &quot;They&quot; are just &quot;A.A.-bashers&quot;, and &quot;A.A.-bashers&quot; don't tell the truth.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't have a working recovery program.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't <i>in recovery</i>.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't have Bill Wilson's doctrines or wisdom.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't &quot;spiritual&quot;.
<li> &quot;They&quot; have resentments.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't know how to recover.
<li> &quot;They&quot; drink.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't doing the Twelve Steps.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't believe.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't have faith.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't know what it's like.
<li> &quot;They&quot; haven't been to Hell and back.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't part of The Fellowship.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't one of us.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't Friends Of Bill Wilson.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't &quot;our kind of people&quot;.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't part of &quot;The Recovery Movement&quot;.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't <i>Working The Program</i>.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't <i>dealing with their issues</i>.
<li> &quot;They&quot; are &quot;enablers&quot;.
<li> &quot;They&quot; will make you drink.
<li> &quot;They&quot; will &quot;trigger you&quot;.
<li> &quot;They&quot; will make alcoholics relapse.
<li> &quot;They&quot; will make you relapse.
<li> &quot;They&quot; will kill you with bad advice.
<li> &quot;They&quot; have too much self-will.
<li> &quot;They&quot; don't want to know God.
<li> &quot;They&quot; aren't doing the Will Of God.
<li> &quot;They&quot; hate God.
<li> &quot;They&quot; are luring vulnerable alcoholics to their deaths by telling
them that they can quit drinking without A.A. and the Twelve Steps.
<li> &quot;They&quot; are leading people away from recovery.
<li> &quot;They&quot; have bad motives &#8212; they are only in it for the money.
<li> &quot;They&quot; have bad motives &#8212; they want to destroy A.A.
<li> &quot;They&quot; have bad motives &#8212; they are atheists who hate spiritual programs.
<li> And those who leave the group become pariahs to be shunned, because
&quot;they might make someone relapse&quot;, and
&quot;they are probably drinking again.&quot;

</ul>
<p>
Part of the reason for the devaluation of the outsider is of course fear
&#8212; fear of criticism for being an alcoholic, fear of disapproval, fear
that the outsider will not &quot;understand&quot; &#8212; &quot;Only another
A.A. member understands.&quot; Outsiders are dangerous and you can't trust them,
but you will be safe inside the cult.
<p>
There is also another secret fear: Fear that the critic might be right.
That thought makes the true believers very uncomfortable.

A.A. wants you to <i>Keep Coming Back</i> to their meetings for the rest

Bill Wilson wrote that when &quot;Father&quot; discovers Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Father feels he has struck something
better than gold. For a time he may try to hug the new treasure to
himself. He may not see at once that he has barely scratched a
limitless lode which will pay dividends only if he mines it for
the rest of his life and insists on giving away the entire product.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, &quot;The Family Afterward&quot;, pages 128-129.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So &quot;Father&quot; must work the A.A. program and recruit new members for
the rest of his life.
<p>
Bill Wilson actually wrote that he wants everyone to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">abandon their intelligence,
&quot;Reason&quot;, and logical, thinking minds</a>, and just &quot;have faith&quot;
in his teachings.
Bill claimed that his A.A. program offers complete religious freedom to members,
but then he claimed the right to dictate everybody else's thoughts and beliefs.
Bill even wrote that you don't have
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#free2think" target="_blank">the right to decide
all by yourself just what you will do and what you will think</a>.

<p>
Bill Wilson went so far as to plant the suggestion that newly recovered
people should not bother to get jobs; they should continue to neglect their
families and just concentrate all
of their attention on working the A.A. program and recruiting new members for A.A.
(like Bill Wilson did):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We think it dangerous if he rushes headlong at his economic problem.<br>
...<br>
For us, material well-being always followed spiritual progress; it
never preceded.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, <i>The Family Afterwards</i>, pages 126-127.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In Bill Wilson's mind, &quot;spiritual progress&quot; meant doing A.A. activities,
particularly recruiting.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though the family does not fully agree with dad's spiritual
activities, they should let him have his head. Even if he
displays a certain amount of neglect and irresponsibility towards
the family, it is well to let him go as far as he likes in
helping other alcoholics. During those first days of
convalescence, this will do more to insure his sobriety than
anything else. Though some of his manifestations are alarming and
disagreeable, we think dad will be on a firmer foundation than
the man who is placing business or professional success ahead of
spiritual development.
He will be less likely to drink again, and anything is preferable to that.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, <i>The Family Afterwards</i>, pages 129-130.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Letting him &quot;go as far as he likes in
helping other alcoholics&quot; really means letting him spend all of his time
recruiting for Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Note the threat: EITHER let him waste all of his time on Alcoholics Anonymous,
OR ELSE he might drink again, and &quot;anything is preferable to that.&quot;
That cleverly combines four propaganda tricks:<br>

Alcoholics Anonymous claims that it must come before <i>everything

<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
And a rehash of the <i>Big Book</i> that is targeted at youths tells this story of an
allegedly-successful recovery, where the spouse gets <i>third place</i> in the A.A. member's
life:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Even after she remarries, she doesn't lose sight of her priorities.
She places God first and A.A. second. Her husband is never more than the third most
important aspect of her life.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Big Book Unplugged; A Young Person's Guide to Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
John R., page 107.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But the &quot;God&quot; that she is supposedly placing before A.A. is
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">really just the meddling dictatorial
&quot;God&quot; that A.A. defines</a>, so she isn't really placing anything before
the A.A. &quot;program&quot;.

A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>

Essentially, Step Eleven demands that the A.A. follower &quot;channel&quot;
God. (Yes,
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult2" target="_blank">channelling, just like
Shirley MacLaine taught</a>.)
The A.A. member is supposed to just sit quietly,

&quot;seeking
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank"><i>Guidance</i></a>&quot;
&quot;through prayer and meditation&quot;,
and wait for God to talk to him.
Then he assumes that his own internal mental noise,
the voices in his head, are <i><b>The Voice of God</b></i>,
talking to him and giving him religious instruction and marching orders:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Note the contradiction here: The standard A.A. dogma says that you
can use anything you wish for your &quot;Higher Power&quot; &#8212; a doorknob, a
teddy bear, a bedpan, a motorcycle, or your A.A. group itself.
But when you practice
Step Eleven, and pray to your Higher Power, your bedpan doesn't
talk back to you, &quot;God&quot; does.)

<p>
Bill Wilson learned this particular technique from
the notorious fascist cult leader
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr. Frank N.D. Buchman</a>,
whose Oxford Groups would sit silently during the
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">Quiet Hour</a>&quot;,
listening for God to give them messages.
(Apparently, God told Frank that
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler" target="_blank">Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler</a> were
really wonderful fellows.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

We consider our plans for the day.

Here we ask God for inspiration...<br>
...<br>
What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration becomes a working
part of the mind.
Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with
God, it is not probable
that we are going to be inspired at all times.
<font color="#9F0000">We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of
absurd actions and ideas.</font>
Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will,
as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration.
<font color="#9F0000">We come to rely on it.</font><br>

<p>
So, if we practice the Twelve Steps enough, we will supposedly end up in a
state of mind where we are in constant <b><i>conscious contact with
God</i></b>, and God is just always guiding us
and telling us what to do, all day long.
We may get into trouble by doing all kinds of absurd things and
believing all kinds of absurd ideas
because we think that God is telling us to do it;
we may, in fact, become totally delusional and insane,
but nevertheless, Bill Wilson says that

A.A. is just a substitute addiction, and just another dependency,
and Bill Wilson plainly declared that members were supposed to become

<ul>
<li> Step One demands that we confess &#8212; &quot;admit&quot; &#8212; that we

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol, that our lives had become unmanageable.</b><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
The other half of Step One, which says that &quot;our lives had
become unmanageable&quot;, leads some people to believe that they
shouldn't even try to manage their own lives.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
In professional 12-Step counselor newspeak, they call it &quot;Inability to maintain sobriety.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li> Step Two is just as bad: it teaches people
that they are insane, and that only a Supernatural Being
can restore them to sanity &#8212; which means that they are helpless,
and cannot heal themselves. (So why bother trying?)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</b><br>

<p>
<li> Then Step Three teaches a lifestyle of
passive dependency, where A.A. members turn control of their wills
and their lives over to &quot;the care of God <i>as we understood
Him</i>&quot;, and they expect God to run their lives and solve all their
problems for them from then on...

The <i>Big Book</i> specifically states that A.A. is a substitute for

</ul>

<p>
<li> Failure to admit powerlessness is considered a major moral
failing, one that will doom you to relapse.

<p>
<li> And if you &quot;take your will back&quot;, that is supposedly
another major moral failing that will doom you to relapse.

<p>
<li> Then they construct their whole religion around the idea that we
are incapable of quitting drinking, drugging, smoking, or over-eating
without <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#God_quits">having
God to do the quitting for us</a>, because we are powerless
over alcohol, our addictions, nicotine, and food. (That's Alcoholics
Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Nicotine Anonymous, and Over-eaters
Anonymous.)
And they say that we must have a sponsor and <i>&quot;Higher Power&quot;</i> running
our lives for us, because we are mentally incompetent, and cannot
do it ourselves.

<p>
<li> Remember the slogan:
<font color="#8f00bf">

<li> Bill Wilson even equated
&quot;<a href="#self_reliance" target="_blank">self-reliance</a>&quot;

one's own will rather than the Will of God.
Bill denounced taking care of yourself and managing your own life as
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#play_God" target="_blank">playing God</a>&quot;. As Bill saw it,
only God has the right to tell you what to do. You don't have the right to decide for yourself.

<p>
<li> Thus, the properly-behaved A.A. member constantly confesses
that he is powerless over alcohol
and is incapable of running his own life,
and needs his sponsor and A.A. to do his thinking for him,
and says that he has no will power of his own because he gave his will away.
So much for having any &quot;inner strength&quot;.

Bill Wilson declared that self-reliance was bad, very bad, and that dependency

According to Bill, self-confidence and will power are terrible things:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence.
Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned,
it was a total liability.
Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a mental obsession
so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it.<br>

<p>
<a name="self_reliance"> </a>
In the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous, there is no difference between self-reliance &#8212;
using your own intelligence to manage your life and take care of yourself &#8212;
and stubborn willfulness, deliberately disobeying the orders that come down from God.

<font face="Helvetica, Sanserif, Courier"><b>&quot;Will&quot;</b></font>
lists 26 items, all of which tell us what is
wrong with having a will, or being willful.
In Bill Wilson's crazy theology, anybody who had a will of his own was in direct conflict with
the Will of God.
The only acceptable morality was to be a grovelling slave of &quot;Higher Power&quot;
or &quot;God, as Bill Wilson understood Him&quot;, depending on &quot;Him&quot; to tell us what to
do with our lives:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The first requirement is that we be convinced that any life run on
self-will can hardly be a success.<br>

Bill Wilson's second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, adds this Orwellian
<b>double-think</b>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Therefore dependence, as A.A. practices it, is really a means of gaining
true independence of the spirit.<br>

And Bill Wilson declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... By so accepting our dependence on this marvel of science
[electricity], we find ourselves more independent personally. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But the moment our mental or emotional independence is in question,
how differently we behave.
<font color="blue">
How persistently we claim the right to decide all by ourselves
just what we shall think and just how we shall act.
</font>
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We are certain that our intelligence, backed by willpower,
can rightly control our inner lives and guarantee us success in
the world we live in.
<font color="blue">
This brave philosophy, wherein each man plays God</font>,
sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to
meet this acid test: how well does it actually work?
One good look in the mirror ought to be answer enough for any
alcoholic.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... The philosophy of self-sufficiency is not paying off. Plainly enough,
it is a bone-crushing juggernaut whose final achievement is ruin.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, we who are alcoholics can consider
ourselves fortunate indeed.<br>

<p>
A.A. tells the newly-sober people that they must put their &quot;sobriety&quot;
(meaning: A.A.) before
<i>everything else</i>, and come to depend upon A.A. to run their lives for them.
<i>Absolutely nothing</i> must come between themselves and
their &quot;sobriety&quot;. That includes wife, children, job, career, everything.
The <i>Big Book</i> actually teaches that
<a href="orange-recruit.html#marriage_counselor" target="_blank">wives and families are expendable</a>
in the selfish pursuit of &quot;sobriety&quot; and &quot;spirituality.&quot;
The new A.A. member must spend all of his spare time going to meetings, preferably
<i>90 Meetings In 90 Days</i>, and must get a sponsor who will supervise his
indoctrination and keep him busy with reading the <i>Big Book</i> and
making lists of personal defects.
<p>
<a name="benefits16"> </a>
Such &quot;treatment&quot; of the so-called &quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism is the
antithesis of good medical treatment. No attempt is made to actually
cure the patient of the disease.
Just the opposite: the object is to addict the patient to the 
so-called &quot;treatment program&quot;, to make him
psychologically dependent upon A.A., 
and to keep him coming back to meetings for the rest of his life.
<p>
A.A. says that you must remain in A.A. for the rest of your life, and you
must continue going to meetings forever. A.A. says that you are powerless
over alcohol, and will never be able to maintain sobriety without depending on your
&quot;support group&quot;. That isn't 'recovery'. That's addiction to the cult.

<p>
Even Marc Galanter, who is an enthusiastic booster of Alcoholics Anonymous,
reported in his book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA generates an intense personal involvement in the group, one comparable
to the members' previous dependency on alcohol, and thus provides them
with &quot;an alternative dependency.&quot; Over 80% of members invite fellow members
to their homes, outside the meeting format. In his studies of the life histories
of alcoholics,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">George Vaillant</a>
has found that recovery from alcoholism most
commonly happens when an alternative dependency is substituted.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The emotional impact of this dependency on AA is apparent in the experience
of many members whose equanimity is closely tied to their stable
relationship to the group. One of my patients, a successful lawyer who
regularly attended AA meetings, spoke of his irritability in dealing with
his wife and partners after returning from a long business trip.<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Sanserif,Courier">
Missing meetings while I was away was a big problem. I didn't get to one for
five days last week and I just couldn't take to that old &quot;button-pushing.&quot;
I kept barking at Jennie and was unpleasant at work. I knew something
was unsteady inside of me that was making me more irritable at every turn.
But getting back to a meeting made me feel like my old self again. I'll
have to make a meeting every day on the next trip.

A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
This one is also pretty obvious.
In the theology of Bill Wilson, everyone is supposed to be a slave of God.
A.A. demands that newcomers just shut up and work the program, which includes
&quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot;.
No questioning of the program is allowed.
Newcomers must work all of the Steps and do whatever their sponsor says.

In Bill Wilson's theology, you are a good person only if you are obeying

<ul>
<li>
The first tradition induces fears and phobias, and tells alcoholics that they will die
without the A.A. cult. And it says that alcoholics must not &quot;break the unity&quot;
of the group, which can only mean that he must conform to the group.
<p>
<li>
Then the second tradition sets up the cult as the authority to
be obeyed. Ostensibly, members are obeying <i>the Will of God</i>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;as He may express Himself in our group conscience&quot;</font>,
but it is really the will of the elders as they voice it in the meetings.
It is absurd to imagine that every time one of the old-timers opens his mouth,
God's opinion comes out.
<p>
<li>
And Tradition Twelve tells you that their &quot;principles&quot; come
before your &quot;personality&quot;. So you must be subordinate to them,
just like you must be &quot;genuinely humble&quot; and subordinate to
&quot;Him who presides over us all.&quot;<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson liked to talk about &quot;spiritual principles&quot; a lot, but
Tradition Twelve and
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step12" target="_blank">Step Twelve</a> do not actually refer to
any &quot;spiritual principles&quot; when it says that we are to

Step Twelve really refers to some
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank"><i>cult practices</i></a> that Bill Wilson borrowed
from Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups cult, which are embodied in the preceding eleven
steps, not to principles.

<i>Newcomers Need Fixing.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10, obviously, and deserves about a hundred.<br>
<p>
Fixing newcomers is what A.A. is all about. They even brag about it.
The whole premise of A.A. is that newcomers are dying of alcoholism, and
the A.A. old-timers have the answer to that problem, and will fix the newcomers.
<p>
Now for sure, people who drink too much alcohol need to stop doing it.
But Alcoholics Anonymous has an additional, hidden, agenda &#8212; converting
the newcomers to the A.A. religious beliefs, and converting the newcomers
into faithful, loyal A.A. members who will <i>Keep Coming Back</i> forever.
<p>
A.A. says that newcomers are insane, that they are immoral, that they have no faith, and
that their thinking is &quot;alcoholic&quot;
and they cannot be trusted to think for themselves. A.A. and Bill Wilson
say that newcomers are selfish, egotistical, manipulative, and dishonest.
And A.A. claims to have the cure for all of that: change the newcomers and make them
believe in the A.A. religion with its &quot;Higher Power&quot; and its
&quot;spiritual experiences&quot;, and get them busy confessing their sins.

Bill Wilson wrote that the real goal of the A.A. program was to give people
religious experiences so powerful that their personalities would
be changed forever, and they would quit drinking permanently. The changes
may happen rapidly, or they may happen slowly, Bill explained, but they must happen:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The terms &quot;spiritual experience&quot; and &quot;spiritual
awakening&quot; are used many times in this book which, upon careful reading,
shows that the personality change sufficient to bring about
recovery from alcoholism has manifested itself among us in many
different forms.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the
impression that these personality changes, or religious experiences,
must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals.
Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Most of our experiences are what the psychologist William James
<font color="blue">
[in his book <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>]</font>
calls the &quot;educational variety&quot; because they develop
slowly over a period of time. Quite often friends of the newcomer
are aware of the difference long before he is himself.
He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in
his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been
brought about by himself alone. What often takes place in a few
months could seldom have been accomplished by years of
self-discipline.<br>

So the A.A. religious-conversion program works on the newcomers
without their even realizing it... until later.</font>
----------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
Bill Wilson also says that newcomers don't really know God, but
they will, if they do his Twelve Steps enough:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Instead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of
God's ever advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe
that our human intelligence was the last word... Rather vain of us,
wasn't it?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,
even against organized religion. ...
People of faith have a logical idea of what life is all about.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, <i>We Agnostics</i>, page 49.</font></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In Step Eleven we saw that if a Higher Power had
restored us to sanity and had enabled us
to live with some peace of mind in a sorely
troubled world, then <font color="#9F0000"><b>such a Higher Power
was worth knowing better, by as
direct contact as possible.</b></font> The persistent use of
meditation and prayer, we found, did open the channel so
that where there had been a trickle, there now was a river
which led to sure power and safe guidance from
<font color="#9F0000"><b>God as we were
increasingly better able to understand Him</b></font>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So, practicing these Steps, we had a spiritual awakening about
which finally there was no question. Looking at those who were
only beginning and still doubting themselves,
<font color="#9F0000"><b>the rest of us were
able to see the change setting in.</b></font>
<a name="group_power"> </a>
From great numbers of such experiences, <font color="#9F0000"><b>we could
predict that the doubter who still claimed
that he hadn't got the &quot;spiritual angle,&quot; and who still
considered his well-loved A.A. group the higher power, would presently
love God and call Him by name.</b></font><br>
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, Bill Wilson tells us that the A.A. religious-conversion program works on the newcomers
without their even realizing it... until later.</font>
<p>
And Bill Wilson says that newcomers don't believe in the <i>right</i> God, either.
Even though A.A. tells newcomers that they can believe in any God or
&quot;Higher Power&quot; they choose, that is just
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">another deceptive recruiting trick</a>.
Eventually,
the newcomers will learn that they must believe in the A.A. version of God.
A book called the <i>&quot;Serenity Bible&quot;</i> describes
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">that theistic
bait-and-switch process</a> precisely:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We may start out as agnostics. We may then come to view the group
or recovery process as our higher power, looking to other
people for strength. Gradually, we accept a vague notion of god,
which grows to a more specific monotheistic god.
We may even begin to pray to and dialogue with this god.
Eventually we come to know the one true God.<br>
</font>

</blockquote>
<p>
So, no matter what you believe to start with,
A.A. will fix your thinking and fix your beliefs, and you
will eventually come to believe in the correct &quot;one true God&quot; of Alcoholics
Anonymous &#8212; a &quot;God&quot; Who wants everybody to be
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Third_Step_Prayer" target="_blank">His grovelling slave</a>.
