Subject:  	Decline of ACA<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I entered AA in the early 90's, through both Al-Anon and ACA.  It's
difficult for me to even perceive a world without the Net. Certainly far
easier to be duped and suckered in, where little outside information was
available, and I was suckered in.

<p>
ACA peaked in the 90's with various therapists promoting it, (eg John
Bradshaw, Claudia Black).

<p>
In 2001 I became involved with ACA again through an interest in the
International ACA Conference in San Marcos, California.  I'd attended this
annually until 2005.  The price for the three day conference continued to
increase, as did the number of vendors, while attendance dropped.  The final
conference had approximately 50 attendees.  It dwindled to a point it was
nothing more than a sales seminar for various vendors/therapists.

<p>
2006 was my breakaway year from any and all 12 step programs.  I spent a
year in therapy and a year with a non-12 step therapist.  I attended SMART,
started a WFS meeting in my area, and moderated my own support group for a
year, (type A personality in action :)

<p>
ACA is as unconscionable as any other 12 step program.  Trauma, shame and
confusion are increased through the perpetration and insistence one is a
sinner, and had a part in any abuse.

<p>
Thought I'd check on what the status was for ACA 2010.  The San Marcos ACA
International has gone out of business, briefly located to Long Beach, CA,
and then into complete demise.

<p>
I checked meetings for San Diego and surrounding area, and the good news is
there are only 8 in existence.

http://www.allone.com/12/aca/</a>

<p>
Contrast this with SMART, who treats the whole person, doesn't deflect from
recommending medical or therapeutic help, (12 SMART meetings in the same
general area).

<p>

<p>
I think we may find consensus in the next major shift, which will be in,
&quot;challenging rehabs and therapists,&quot; on using the 12 steps as appropriate
treatment.

<p>
My best,

<p>

Hi again, Sherp,
<p>
I think the question is just a matter of defining terms. In part of their report,
they spoke in general terms of total damage to all of society, not about the damage to
the individual. 
Drugs that are not commonly used won't score very high in total cost to society.
<p>
Personally, I regard speed as one of the most destructive of all drugs. It will
quickly destroy a person's body like nothing else in this world.
However, only a few people take it. What are there, maybe 10 or 20 thousand
hard-core speed freaks in the USA? The damage to them cannot compare to the
total damage that is caused by tens of millions of US citizens drinking too
much alcohol.
<p>
However, I wonder why I don't see tobacco scoring very high.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	no white chip needed<br>

<p>
Hey Orange,

<p>
I've been a reader of your site for a few years now.  I had nearly three
years of sobriety until just last Friday when I caved on an all inclusive
(alcohol everywhere) trip to a resort.  I have been around alcohol on many
occasions during those three years but I had a hard time being immersed in
it for a week and caved on the last day of the trip when I drank and again
caught the all hallowed buzz.  Over the next few days my mind played out the
stuggle of trying to justify to myself that drinking again might be an
option for me and was relieved this morning when I told myself no, that this
was a one time slip-up and that sobriety must remain a constant in my
life. The only people I need to answer to regarding my slip-up are God,
myself, and my wife; in that order.  I don't need to go to a meeting and
tell a group of people that my nearly three years of sobriety was a complete
waste of time and that I am now starting over again completely.  It's scarey
how just opening that door by drinking one time led me to think that I might
be able to drink again and has consumed my thoughts for the last few days.
I started thinking about when the next time I might be able to drink again
would be; a trip to my brother's house in a few weeks, maybe during the
holidays, or maybe when my wife has a girls' night out for the evening.  This
is a sure sign that I can't ever be a normal drinker and that sobriety must
be my way of life.  I am dissapointed in myself for giving in, but glad that
it didn't lead to an immedate return to my normal drinking patterns like it
had in the past before the three years of sobriety.  Which in all honesty is
largely due to the fact that I am now married and my wife knows about
my past drinking issues.  It's not due to any sort of new found will-power
that has been bestowed upon me.  Unfortunately, drinking this one time will
make it more of a challenge for me to say no in the near future.  During the
last three years it has been a relatively easy decision for me to say no.
But I know that after a period of time it will be an easy choice again, it
might be a few days or a few months, but I'll get there again.

<p>
Thanks for lending a sympathetic ear (or monitior), putting some of
this down on paper helps to organize the thoughts.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
knj

Hi Nathan,
<p>
Thanks for an enlightening letter. I can really relate to it.
Nineteen years ago, I slipped and relapsed and &quot;went out&quot; for nine years.
I don't recommend it. Quitting again immediately is definitely the way to go.
<p>
When you described how drinking suddenly occupied all of your thoughts, and how
your base brain
(&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">lizard brain</a>&quot;)
was planning the next drinking session,
and insisting that a little drinking will be okay, that sounded so familiar.
That's what happened with me too.
And that is the big red warning flag that says that it won't be okay.
<p>
And another thing rings a bell: The idea that it will be okay to drink
because you were able to quit again so quickly.
I went through that too, where I got worried that I was suddenly drinking a
lot, and drinking every day, so I decided to quit again. I did, and I didn't
drink again for a few weeks.
But then old Lizard Brain argued that I could drink again because I can easily quit again
if it becomes a problem. Not so. I ended up drinking for another nine years. Quitting again
and again is not so easy. You can lose your will power, and quitting again becomes monstrously
difficult.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you got a grip and stopped it fast.
<p>
So have a good day and a good life now.

Subject:  	Enabling<br>

<p>
I  have noticed that very often it is people who are in professionals who are
least likely to help out those in need of some assistance.  They use excuses
like not wanting to &quot;enable&quot; someone or that it is necessary for a person to it
a bottom before they can overcome a problem.  In my opinion enabling does not
consist of giving financial  assistance, food or a roof over their head. To me
enabling only means assisting someone to get a addictive substance.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I totally agree. This is enabling:

<p>
It is tragic that Alcoholics Anonymous does not want to give any actual help to down-and-out
alcoholics and street drunks. But that was
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#no_charity" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's heartless theology</a>
&#8212; his Oxford Group
and Moral Re-Armament organization never gave out any
charity, not ever &#8212; and Bill Wilson copied the policy:


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

</font>
<p>
One extreme example that I witnessed was when my former employer tried to deny
unemployment benefits to a former employee because getting unemployment would
&quot;enable&quot;  the laid-off former employee.  A couple of years ago a friend of mine
who was dealing with a drinking problem was suddenly faced with being homeless
and out of work.  I let him stay in my spare room and shared food with him until
he was able to get food stamps.  After I took him in I got a phone call from his
old AA sponsor who also happened to be a licensed social worker.  This guy told
me not to give his friend a place to stay because things needed to get worse for
the man before he could get better and that me helping was a form of enabling.
This is not the first time I have heard of licensed professionals being the
least willing to help a person in need.  It is as though all that training
educates human compassion right out of them.  BTW I do know other professionals
who do assist people in need and my own physician as well as a neighbor who is
an MSW  said it was a good thing to help my friend who by the way got back on
his feet, reimbursed me for rent and making progress on abstaining from booze.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, one of my favorite phrases is &quot;college-educated fools&quot;. I'm all for education, and it
is generally a very good thing, and usually, people need a lot more of it,
but unfortunately some people get lost in it and lose contact
with reality. They can't see a suffering person in front of their eyes; they can only see
theories and policies.
<p>
Then there is also the issue of sadism. The way that some people treat alcoholics can only be
described as sadistic. Many people in positions of power, both &quot;recovery professionals&quot; and
A.A. sponsors, seem to take delight in torturing those disgusting weak-willed sinners
&#8212; and it's always for their own good, of course.

I am curious to see if you have noticed what seems to be a trend for

someone to hit bottom and their willingness to send them to the bottom.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't know if it is &quot;a trend&quot;. The trend line may be in the other direction.
A.A. may have peaked out. I think it has.
We have actually had crazy professionals promoting the 12-Step cult treatment ever since
Dr. Silkworth and
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html" target="_blank">Dr. Harry Tiebout</a>
back in the nineteen-thirties and 'forties.
I think that things were worse during the nineteen-sixties
through the nineteen-nineties when &quot;everybody knew&quot; that A.A. was the best answer,
and Ann Landers spent 30 years promoting Alcoholics Anonymous.
Now, professionals are beginning to wake up and smell
the coffee. A lot of professionals are seeing that A.A. has failed to deliver the goods.
A.A. has had 70 years to show how well it works, and to produce some good results,
and it has not done so.

<p>
Still, it is an ongoing battle. The Steppers do not wish to give up their monopoly on
the &quot;recovery&quot; industry, and they are still greedy for those billions of dollars that
flow into the &quot;treatment centers&quot;, so this fight is going to go on for a while longer.

Hello,

<p>
I'm a long-time reader of your site even though I have never been an
alcoholic or involved in AA (a YouTube video had your URL at the end and I
checked the site out*.) Anyway, I follow a blog called &quot;College Misery&quot;;
it's an anonymous blog where college professors write about their cruddy
jobs under assumed names, and last week one of the contributors &#8212; 
&quot;EnglishDoc&quot; &#8212; made a post (written as a fake note to an &quot;Alcoholic Andrea&quot;,
who had recently come back from rehab) where they told how this person had
drunkenly called them 15 times in 5 days. At the end of the post EnglishDoc
suggested to Andrea that she go back to rehab or AA. In the comments section
I wrote (as &quot;Strelnikov&quot;) that 12 step programs didn't work, suggested SOS
and other recovery systems, and gave your URL. I thought nobody would say a
thing, but 20 minutes later somebody wrote back, then another, then finally
AA member with 29 years. It snowballed from there and by the end of it I was
repeatedly told that I was patronizing the 29 year AA veteran. I really
didn't want to argue in depth, but it seemed that these people were
horrified that there was some other system of getting clean &#8212; and there are

I can see what &quot;miserable adjunct&quot; was trying to do; he was trying to
power-trip me because he has time within AA and I'm just an outsider. Notice
that the most abusive responder (&quot;Marcia Brady&quot;) isn't in AA at all; her dad
is/was. I didn't want to be the dogmatic asshole, but notice that my three
posts created nine responses. I know that a lot of students, graduate
students, and professors battle the bottle, but 90% of the people who
commented on that thread either were in AA, knew people in AA, or were just
pro AA. Having grown up in Evangelical schools I can see that the 12 steps are
little more than a cheap conversion tool; the only difference between them and
what a pastor or missionary does is that the holy man demands that you get on
your knees and pray for salvation after some sob story. It was just amazing
that nobody was willing to question the Big Book, possibly because their
careers depended on it. Please send a response by email, and please don't
include this in your letters section; it's too trifling.

* There is a YouTuber called &quot;4ube&quot; who had the Penn and Teller &quot;Bullshit&quot; show on
AA in three chunks, and after watching that I ran across the video with your URL.
Actually I'd known about the 12 steps for some time; I used to do un-armed security
on a hospital that had a separate detox wing and the local AA chapter would use
their meeting room. One night they left a large easel card with them on it and it
blew me away; I thought that AA was some sort of Gestalt-style therapy.

Hello again,

<p>
Since I wrote that previous note some interesting things have
happened at the web site: (1.) the subject was completely dropped
(usually pieces that get a lot of comments get some passing mention
in future posts); and (2.) &quot;miserable adjunct&quot; the veteran AA guy
completely vanished. He is still listed as a contributor but I
haven't seen him make a post or comment since. Actually the guy that
runs the web site wants posters who haven't done much to relinquish
their posting ability because the site has one-hundred posters (the
Blogspot limit) but only ten or twelve actually write in.

<p>
Please respond,

Hello Jake,

Thanks for the input. Pardon me for taking so long to answer, but I've been offline a lot,

So how many people has he seen fail in 29 years? One success story in 29 years does not
prove that A.A. works.

&quot;AA may not recognize you as a graduate, but you can stop going anytime and continue to not drink; my dad hardly ever goes anymore.&quot;</font>
<p>

The writer tries to imply that many people are sober because of A.A. but we can't see them.

<p>
Likewise:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;As has already been pointed out, &quot;no longer coming to meetings&quot; is not an accurate gauge of &quot;no longer using&quot;, because there is no way to know how many people who aren't going to meetings anymore have started using again, and how many have simply realised that they no longer need the meetings. I know more than one person who kicked the habit using AA, doesn't go to meetings anymore, doesn't drink anymore either, and hasn't for years.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The author admitted that he didn't know how many people drop out of A.A. and return to drinking.
Yet he wants us to assume that most of the A.A. dropouts are really sober.
But he has no evidence other than &quot;more than one person&quot; that he knows.
<p>

Well, back in 1987, I went to four A.A. meetings (only 4, ever),
and also quit drinking and kept myself sober for
the following three years. But that is not evidence that A.A. works,
or that A.A. dropouts are sober.
That is evidence that A.A. is unnecessary.

<p>
The writer is also 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">
 assuming a cause-and-effect relationship</a> 
where none exists. There is zero evidence that people quit drinking 
because of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, or doing the 12 Steps,
or reading the <i>Big Book</i>, or any of the rest of it. When
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">real valid controlled tests</a>
were done, A.A. totally failed to get the alcoholics to quit drinking.

<p>
But Klytaimnestra said the opposite:
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I have been sober for 18 years, 3 months, and 4 days. I haven't been to a meeting in years, but I certainly credit AA for my sobriety.&quot;</font>

<p>
But his crediting A.A. is wishful thinking.
Then he again tries the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>:<br>

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Not all methods work for all people. AA works very well for some of us.&quot;

</blockquote>

<p>
Listing and confessing all of your sins to a sponsor is not humiliating? Being told that
you are weak and powerless and selfish and egotistical and a disgusting incurable sinner
who cannot think right is not humiliating?
That guy has a funny idea of humiliation.

</font>
<p>
At the end of that sentence, the writer admitted that he had no evidence that some A.A.
members got any real help from A.A.; it just seemed like they did.
Nevertheless, he wants people to believe that A.A. works anyway, based on appearances, and he
wants the critic to shut up and go away.

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The claim that A.A. &quot;spirituality&quot; is not &quot;religion&quot; is false.
Even several Federal Circuit Court Judges have made that ruling.
And it is not a matter of &quot;how much direct exposure you've had to AA.&quot;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
It's just another typical debate with believers of the 12-Step religion.
It's all propaganda and debating tricks, with few or no actual facts to support their
crazy statements. Parakeet as your &quot;Higher Power&quot; indeed.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	abuse in aa<br>

<p>
Hello Terry,

<p>
I am over in Spokane WA and I have never talked with you but we were friends
when I was on facebook.  Ok, so I don't know where to begin.  I have such a
long, disturbing story concerning aa it is overwhelming.

<p>
I started going when I was 19 and I am 36 now and  I have grown a lot, I no
longer even try and make aa &quot;work&quot; for me and so much of that has to do with
finding your site, the information has been so wonderful just to know somebody
out there is speaking what I have felt.

<p>
So I am going to try and write up a draft of my experience in aa, and send it to
you.  For now my question is what is it gonna take to get the public truly aware
of what aa is?  I  think it is actually at least growing (the people that expose
aa)  but mainstream society is still ignorant about it.

<p>
What can I do to try and get the word out?   I have thought perhaps starting an
alternative group over here.

<p>
As far as letting mainstream society know about aa, what if we  (people that
know the truth about aa) were to bombard the media, with our stories as well as
the facts about aa.   Maybe Bill Maher or somebody that would be open to hearing
it.  I dk, I just really think there has to be a way to let the masses know
about how sick, corrupt and dishonest aa is.

<p>
So I'm sure your busy, but I would love to actually talk to you, I left my #
with you don't know if you still have it.  At least let me know what you think
of my ideas.

<p>
Take care,<br>
Jennifer

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jennifer,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. You are already on the right track:
It will take a lot of publicity and information to expose A.A. for what it is.
The A.A. promotion machine has a 70-year head start in spreading the myths that
A.A. has a working program, and A.A is the best way to recover.
The public does not know the truth because all that they ever heard was that
A.A. is some secret anonymous society of recovering people that really works.

<p>
So what we have to do is tell the truth, and keep at it until enough people know the
truth.
(And I think &quot;enough people&quot; will end up being quite a large number.)
When enough people know the truth, things will change.
<p>
All of your ideas about how to get the truth out sound like good ideas.
I would suggest just trying every channel and medium that you can, and get
whatever successes you can whereever you can. 
TV programs, letters to the editor, magazine articles and stories,
 the web, you name it. Whatever works. And I think that
it all helps. The cumulative effect will be just like the cumulative effect of
A.A.'s 70 years of self-promotion.

<p>
I look forwards to your story. Have a good day now.

<p>
You put a lot of work to make this website. I wonder what you have against AA. Is it
the reference to God? A lot of people who don't like religion get sober through AA.
You seem like the kind of man Samuel Clements wrote about, &quot;A critic is someone who
dresses up in a suit of armor to attack an ice cream cone.&quot;  It seems like you would
rather see people be destroyed by their addiction, rather than come to sobriety
through a higher power. There are some unfortunate people who cannot submit to God
in this lifetime. However, you should know, that you will bow before His Son.

<p>
Wonder why you don't have the courage to use your real name.

Dear Mr/Mrs Orange,

<p>
I was just looking over ur &quot;orange papers&quot; and i must say that i
was impressed with ur intellect. It appears that youve spent alot of
time pointing out the flaws of the entity that has saved me life. I
should point that in my experience the fellowship and the principles
contained in those twelve steps are what has saved my life and allow
me to live in peace today. I fear that your resentful writings are
actually a greater detriment to those seeking help than the fellowship
itself. I agree, aa is not for everyone. A person must completely
admit defeat and want to change. Thats what the twelve steps do. And
being able to do that is a miracle for an alcoholic/heroin addict like
myself! Im sorry that you had a bad experience when u went to a
meeting, or you feel like like ur too smart for aa. Resentment is an
aweful thing to live with everyday. I hope you will find some
happiness in ur life someday... Until then, God bless!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you chose to quit drinking alcohol
and shooting dope
and save your own life. I do not accept the notion that attending a cult religion's meetings
saved your life. You did it yourself. Nobody held your hand every Saturday night but you.
You chose to save your own life, and improve your lifestyle, and then you did it.
(But of course the cult will tell you that they did it for you, and you owe them your life.)


<p>
There are no &quot;principles&quot; in the 12 Steps.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
 The 12 Steps are cult religion practices</a>, not
spiritual principles.

<p>
These are spiritual principles:
<ol>
<li> Love thy neighbor and love thy God as thyself.
<li> Honesty is the best policy.
<li> Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
<li> Get a grip on yourself and take control of your life and start doing the right things.
</ol>

<p>
These are cult practices:
<ol>
<li> Write a list of all of your moral shortcomings and defects of character and read it out loud
to your sponsor.
<li> Dole out the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous to newcomers by
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="newwin111"><i>Teaspoons, Not Buckets</i></a>.
<li> Practice tough love towards those disgusting backsliders.
<li> &quot;Make a surrender&quot;.
</ol>

<p>
There is nothing wrong with &quot;having a resentment&quot; against criminals who hurt sick people.
If you don't have any &quot;resentments&quot; against evil, then there is something wrong with you.

<p>
The statement that &quot;AA is not for everyone&quot; is called an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape Via Relativism</a>.
It's like,
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Well, your daughter may have gotten raped by her A.A. sponsor, and your son
may have learned a bunch of cult religion nonsense and become a fanatical babbling lunatic, but
I enjoy my A.A. meetings, so A.A. is okay for some people.&quot;</font><br>
(But by that illogic, so is Scientology, Satan-worship, and the Nazi Party.)

Subject:  	AA as a cult.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson has been dead for decades, who is the AA cult leader now?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Cody,
<p>
Thanks for the question. There isn't any one single leader any more. The current leadership
is distributed. You can start with
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#Trustees" target="_blank">
the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc.</a>, and then count all of the
30-year old-timers as some more leaders. And then there is the whole pyramid of leaders in
the national council and state councils, and the area councils below them.

<p>
This is a common phenomenon with cults when the leader dies. Some cults, like Scientology, have one
absolute dictator take over.  With Scientology, it's David Miscavige.
In other cults, like the Hari Krishnas, a group of a dozen
&quot;Zone Gurus&quot; took over and divided up the world between themselves.
Other cults just fall apart and never develop a new leadership.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	A question<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
How are you?  I hope all is well.  Every so often, I go back to your website
and chance takes me along a different path of articles and letters.  Today I
was reading some of the stuff about the origin of A.A., like the
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-prospectus.html</a>
 and some letters about
how A.A. is really just the Cult of Buchmanism and The Oxford Group, and so
on.

<p>
Well, suddenly I was struck by something.  This may seem like a rather odd
question considering the massive amount of material on your site, but I
can't help wondering if you've ever gone public with this information.  You
know what I mean.  &quot;Public&quot; in the sense that you seek out an audience for
this knowledge, either by contacting the media, or some high profile
websites, or writing this up and selling it, or whatever.

<p>
I mean, for me to read that prospectus was somewhat mind-blowing.  Who
woulda thunk!  I've been involved in the stock market for over 30 years, and
I'm also been through &quot;re-hab&quot; two times during those 30 years, but the
thought of relating one to the other really is wild.

<p>
And the fact that it's not just your idea that this A.A. thing is &quot;sort of&quot;
cult-like, but rather you have all the details that lay out the origin of
how it really is a cult in fact, is incredible to say the least.  I
seriously believe you could blow a whole a mile wide in this whole thing if
your knowledge became widespread.

<p>
Somehow I figure you've been asked this before and have a good answer.

<p>
Take care,

<p>
Richard D.

<font color="blue">
Hi Richard,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
The simple answer is, I have &quot;gone public&quot; by publishing all of this information on
the Internet. The information has been out there for 8 or 10 years now, and available
to anyone who wants it.
<p>
The big problem is that most people don't want it. They can't be bothered with the truth.
<p>
For instance, a reporter from the Wall Street Journal contacted me a few years ago.
He wanted to do an article on me and my web site and Alcoholics Anonymous. So he did a bunch
of research and interviewed a bunch of people who had written letters to the web site.
But then he couldn't get his bosses to publish an article about the Orange Papers and
A.A. They didn't think it was relevant to the economy, or the state of the world, or whatever
their logic was.
<p>
Likewise, the legal authorities don't want to know the truth about A.A. They use A.A. as a cheap
and dirty solution to the problem of drunk drivers and wife beaters and drug addicts, and
if A.A. were discredited, the judges and parole officers would have to find something else,
and that would be a bother and might cost money. So they are too lazy to want to do anything
different, and they just make excuses like, &quot;It's all so controversial.&quot;
<p>
The &quot;professionals&quot; who sell 12-Step cult religion as a quack medical treatment
for drug and alcohol problems sure don't want to
hear the truth. Many of them are so incompetent that they don't know anything but
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">parrotting A.A. slogans and
 telling their clients to go to three 12-Step meetings per week and get a sponsor</a>.
They will lose their jobs if the powers that be recognize that A.A. is a load of bull crap.

<p>
So here we have a good example of institutional inertia. It's easier to just ignore the
truth and do nothing.

RE: YOUR ARTICLE IN WIRED A FEW MONTHS BACK

<p>
Brendon,

<p>
Sorry but are you like 12 or new to the magazine or just broke and have no
integrity in journalism? (integrity and journalism yeah right!!!)

<p>
Ornery Old timers, nubile newcomers, yuk.  Enough with the alliterations.
They are all going to panic because they can't find a meeting. They will
white knuckle it tonight but they will find one tomorrow. (even the click of
a glass can set them off or the smell of stale beer, the love of smelly beer
is so loved, do cha know and they are just that POWERLESS) The woman with
smeared make-up in her 20's who just came off a coke and booze binge (wow,
it is really working for her, while the mustachioed man in tight jeans is
reading a magazine and eyeing up the 20-something's ass. Maybe you should
check the brains of religious fanatics too. According to your suggestions
their brains should be as messed up as an addict's or alcoholic's since
their receptors mean their belief in God must be the same.

<p>
Dr. Drew Pinsky?? (millionaire A.A. pimp) and no money is exchanged. Just
how much did you get to print/write this horseshit? No money? Bill Wilson
made no money??? A.A. makes no money?? Do some research, please!!!

<p>
Want to puke,

Hello Cindy,
<p>
Thanks for the carbon-copy of the letter to Wired. Yes, I was disappointed by that article
too. I have liked and admired Wired magazine for many years, and they seemed to be
very hip and sharp when it came to seeing what was happening on the Internet.
<p>
I was very surprised that Wired magazine would publish
<a href="orange-letters189.html#Wired" target="_blank">
 such an inaccurate piece of cult propaganda</a>.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Michael O'M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thanks for your site<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
Just wanted to throw in another letter of thanks about this site.  It helps to know
there are those out there who speak out against what many people in the US simply
assume is the only real known way to deal with addictive behavior.  AA certainly has
its many apologists (the ones who crow about their 25, 30, 35+ years of sobriety and
all the &quot;millions&quot; of those it's helped for those who &quot;wanted it&quot;) but it's nice to
get another perspective, at least to know that sobriety is simply no longer abusing
a substance and that people DO have the power to take that up on their own.  I must
admit, I'm not of the mindset that AA is a cult (people in AA outside of treatment
centers usually come and go pretty freely and I certainly wasn't bothered when I
stopped going) but I do think that it is a method of &quot;treatment&quot; which relies
heavily on archaic, unproven dogma and homespun slogans and bromides which can be
counterproductive as you most extensively document.
<p>
It's a shame because I went through AA after a DUI in 2002 and was involved on and
off for about 5 or 6 years afterwards.  At the time, I believed I learned a lot
from these folks and I still believe many of those in the rooms are good and
sincere if misguided people.  For me, I simply got tired of labeling myself and any
and all problems in my life &quot;alcoholic.&quot;  I was never an alcoholic anyway but a
young 20something when I came into the rooms who simply drank too much for a period
of time before growing out of it both within and outside of AA.

<p>
Anyway, I respect that you take the time to explain your views and back it up with
research and I believe you've done more good than you may even know.  You help to
give voice and confidence to those who don't feel right in AA but have yet to
believe that there is a viable alternative.  I may not agree with the idea that AA
is a cult exactly but I do believe you bring up great points and I believe you've
been more honest than most people I knew in the rooms.  Keep up the good work!

<p>
Mike

Hi Mike,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I think you are setting the bar too high
when it comes to calling something a cult. You mentioned the fact that people
in A.A. can come
and go freely. Well of course. It is extremely rare for cults to set up armed compounds and
shoot the deserters who try to leave. The only cult that comes to mind there
 is Rev. Jim Jones' People's Temple and his &quot;Jonestown&quot; in Guyana.
That was a spectacularly insane and murderous cult. It is also the only cult
 where 900 people drank
cyanide Flavor-Aid&reg; and committed mass suicide for the leader.
<p>
Most cults are far less crazy and dogmatic, but they are still cults.
People freely come and go from Scientology and the Moonies and the Hari Krishnas, too, and
they are real cults.
<p>
I suggest that you read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the cult test</a>.
There you will find that the item
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_threats4leaving">Threats of bodily harm or death to someone who leaves the cult</a> is only one of a hundred standard cult characteristics, and it is a
characteristic that is exhibited by only the most dangerous and crazy of hard-core cults.
The last seven items of the cult test are the absolute worst cult characteristics that are
exhibited by only the most crazy and murderous cults, things like shooting deserters,
physically attacking critics, and committing mass suicide.
Ordinary street A.A. doesn't do those things, but it's still a cult.

<p>
I agree that you will find some good people in 
A.A. I have occasionally joked and called them
&quot;<a href="orange-letters168.html#NRL" target="newwin939">The Newcomer Rescue League</a>&quot;,
and said that their reason for existing was to rescue the newcomers from bad sponsors.

<p>
Have a good day.
