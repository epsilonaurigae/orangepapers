Subject:  	AA article, thanks<br>

<p>
Hey,
<p>
I just read your article on Alcoholics Anonymous and I'm glad someone else
feels the same way that I do.  I tried that program, which completely
ignored the facts that I was sexually molested by my father for 12 years in
childhood.  So instead of dealing with the real problems of why I used
alcohol as an escape the way I did, I focused only on the physical act of
drinking and was completely misguided by AA.  I'm now 32 years old, just
finishing up my degree and finally have my drinking under control.  How you
may ask?  By going to a psychiatrist, getting a medication and speaking with
a licensed therapist.  These actions in the last year have turned my life
around.  I spent almost 10 years in and out of that god-forsaken program,
and your article just absolutely nailed it.  You have to be a follower, just
plain stupid, or full of self-hate to make it in that program.  I think it
should be illegal for courts to send people to AA.  Oh and if you're not a
christian, you most definitely feel like the odd man out in that program.
I can say without a shadow of a doubt that AA made my life worse, assisted
me in wasting 10 years dickering about how hopeless and pathetic I was, and
what a failure I was drinking the way I did.  It's utter bullshit!  Anyway,
I really enjoyed that article, I wish I had read it 12 years ago!

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
It may sound like an exaggeration, but I think your work saved my life.  Who is
currently working on permanently exposing the scandal that is the 12 step program?
Please let me know if I can do anything to help.  Is there a forum where we can
share stories?

<p>
It strikes me that the baddies here are the therapists and professional counsellors
who secretly sell aa.

<p>
Surely there must be millions and millions of people who have had even the slightest
experience of aa and know that it is bs. I don't understand why there isn't a huge
angry army after it.  Where are these people?  How can I connect with them?

<p>
I cannot adequately express my gratitude.

<p>
If someone looks on the internet for advice about alcoholic drinking, then the
website ask.com comes up on the first page of google answers.  The entry under
alcoholism is a verbatim piece of aa propoganda, with no room whatsoever for any
doubt.  Alcoholism is an incurable disease, etc.

<p>
It quotes the AMA.

<p>
Please have a look.

<p>
All the best.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Catherine,

<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for the compliments.

<p>
Yes, I've looked at the about.com pages on alcoholism.
That section is obviously being managed by a hidden Stepper who
is just using about.com to broadcast his cult propaganda.
About.com used to have a lot of useful information.
<!----
(<a href="orange-links.html#about" target="_blank">links here</a>)-->
But I guess the Steppers have put an end to that.
They also censor Wikipedia, and erase everything that
they don't like. Any true information about A.A. is generally gone in an hour, replaced
by their dogma.

<p>
That is just what they do. The so-called &quot;Tradition&quot; about
&quot;a program of attraction, not promotion&quot;
is totally hypocritical. They promote A.A. constantly. A.A. is nothing but
a fantastically successful self-promotion machine.
Scientology and the Moonies can only look upon A.A. in envy,
and wish that they could do it too.

<p>
I am working on getting a forum system going. Soon, I hope.

<p>
In the mean time, there are several existing forums where you can communicate with other
like-minded people.
<a href="orange-letters161.html#alt_list" target="_blank">The list is here</a>.
<p>
And yes, telling the truth about A.A. and its quack cure is the best answer that I can
think of. We need more publicity that tells the truth (which is why the Steppers are
doing the exact opposite): articles for newspapers and magazines, letters to Senators and
Congressmen, also conversations with and letters to and support of local politicians,
who are often the people who fund the recovery programs at the local level.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

<p>
My what a hater you are.  None of the information (?) you spew is anywhere
near correct or factual.

<p>
I wonder why it is you hate AA.  We ask nothing of anyone outside or rooms.

<p>
May your Higher Power bless and keep you!

<p>
Tom

<p>
FBO

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, Gee, Tom,
<p>
Where to start?
<p>
Well, let's start with the single most important point:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
Then you say that you ask for nothing of anyone outside of the rooms.
That is just not true at all. Alcoholics Anonymous runs a huge publicity machine
to promote A.A. and get more paying customers into the 12-Step based treatment
centers, and to make the public belief that 12-Step cult religion actually works
as a cure for drug and alcohol problems. A.A. never stops spreading misinformation
about alcohol and drugs and addiction and recovery.
<p>
We were just talking about that
<a href="orange-letters169.html#about" target="_blank">here</a>,
noticing how the web site
Alcoholism.About.Com is just a big advertisement for A.A. and 12-Step quack cures.
<p>
Then A.A. practices
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">coercive recruiting</a>
 and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>.
That is all done outside of &quot;the roomz&quot;. If the A.A. true believers
would say in those rooms, they wouldn't be so obnoxious, but they don't.
They have to get out and meddle in other people's lives.
(It is called &quot;Twelfth-Step Work&quot;.)
<p>
Now, you claimed that none of my information is correct. Well, I research very carefully.
I challenge you to show us what is in error.
Please provide clear quotes, and tell what web page you got it from.
Then explain what you think the truth is.
Of course, you must supply valid
evidence to back up your statements,
something better than my documentation,
like proper clinical studies of the effectiveness
of A.A. for curing alcoholics. Propaganda screeds and misleading articles are not
valid evidence of anything except proof that A.A. is
a program of promotion, not attraction.

<p>
Have a good day.

I would like to recommend to you a book which has shed a great deal of light on the

I am also mentioning this because the title does not appear on your reading list.
The book is titled &quot;The Heart of Addiction&quot; by Lance Dodes, M.D. I wholeheardedly
recommend it. It's an easy read and offers a compelling, modern, scientific picture
of addiction. Many treatment professionals base individual programs on the ideas in
this book.

You make a few good points. AA is not and never has been perfect. There
is nothing particularly new in the Oxford group, AA or any other
religious or spiritual practice. It's universal all over the world since
time began. It's not Bills doing. Are you saying that Bill alone made it
up? That's incorrect. He/they barrowed from all religions to write the
big book.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Darrin,
<p>
Thanks for the letters.
<p>
Those statements are just plain old wrong. The theology of Alcoholics Anonymous is
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">pure Buchmanism</a>,
not &quot;borrowed from all religions&quot;.  Even Bill Wilson said so:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, page 39.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Language of the Heart</i>, William G. Wilson, page 298.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson was, of course, being dishonest there when he used the name of
Sam Shoemaker as the leader of the Oxford Groups. The American and British
people could still remember Frank Buchman raving,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;</font>,
so Wilson didn't want to mention Frank Buchman.  But Buchman was the real
leader of the Oxford Groups, and Buchman was the creator of all of
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">that wierd occult theology</a>.
</font>
<p>
<p>
 I have always known they spoon feed you the program. People in
AA are generally smart cookies and very wary of any bullshit. It's hard
to pull the wool over an alcoholics eyes.
<p>
<font color="blue">

Except I don't agree the courts should sentence people to AA, but they
do, and most people I know in AA think it should stop.

 I deal with the
best I can. AA changes all the time. It is a work in progress. I have
found AA- the fellowship, to be full of all kinds of good and some not
so good. I tell newcomers up front the whole program and I hold nothing
back from them. The program is in the book. Take it or leave it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
A &quot;work in progress&quot;? A.A. has been around for more than 70 years now, and
 all of that time, they have been claiming that A.A. works great.
A.A. true believers even routinely tell me that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The Program is perfect; it's just the people who are imperfect.&quot;
</font>
And
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The Program never fails; it's just the people who fail The Program.&quot;
</font>
And now you are telling me that A.A. isn't really complete and together yet?

<p>
Actually, there is much more of &quot;The Program&quot; that is not in the book:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>Go to meetings, get a sponsor, read the books, work the steps, get into service,
don't get into a relationship for a year, don't criticize &quot;The Program&quot;,
&quot;share&quot; in meetings, moan about how stupid you are and how smart your sponsor
is,
memorize a zillion slogans and parrot them, don't tell the
truth about Bill Wilson or the history of Alcoholics Anonymous,
 and give all the credit for your sobriety to A.A....</i>
</font>
<p>
There is a lot of other stuff to do, besides &quot;The Program&quot; that is in the <i>Big Book</i>.
</font>
<p>
I have left it several times with no one on my back about it, but came back to
it because it feels right to me. I love AA. I actually want a spiritual
life. I enjoy it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it's called &quot;being addicted to the cult&quot;. It happens in every cult.
</font>
<p>

 I have had wonderfull life experiences because of it
and AA. There is much you do not know about AA, and that is painfully
obvious to me. It wouldn't be to you because you don't know any better.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Nothing like a little &quot;spiritual one-upmanship&quot;, is there?
</font>
<p>
If you look hard enough you will find any negetive thing you like about
any topic, but the worst thing about your rant is that you have in many
cases misinterpreted all kinds of stuff about AA.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And that is classic minimization and denial.
</font>
<p>
 Who gives a fuck what
the Oxford group did! It failed! Who cares? I don't. Why do you?
<p>
<font color="blue">
The Oxford Group created Alcoholics Anonymous. All that Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob,
and Clarence Snyder did was steal it and give it a new name.

</font>
<p>
 No my
friend, I greatfuly and gladly go to AA and &quot;drink the coolaid&quot; and
deeply enjoy my cult, except it isn't a cult. Anyone with any brains and
knowledge can see that if they take the time.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh really? You don't supply any facts to refute what is in
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>.
</font>
<p>

 A religion? Maybe. If it
is than I'm game. If it is designed to slowly lead you to a more
religious life, I myself have slowly become very much OK with that, and
I share about that in meetings all the time-openly in front of the old
timers and newcomers alike and could not care in the slightest if they
don't like it, but I am respected for my honesty I think. I have had no
problems as a result of it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, we agree that Alcoholics Anonymous is a religion.
<p>
But then again, the Federal Judges declared that a long time ago.
</font>
<p>

 I myself have been very critical of the
fellowship at times and I hold nothing back. AA is constantly growing
and changing. But of course you don't know that. We AA's are a whole
hell of a lot smarter than you give us credit for. It's people like you
that are the &quot;sheople&quot;- you just follow along with the same ol bologny
and don't check your facts. So be it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I am constantly checking my facts, and collecting more facts.
<p>
Speaking of which, you have not presented any facts. Not one fact in your whole rap.
Just denials and dodges.
</font>
<p>

 AA will be here long after you and
I are gone, and pal, last time I checked this was still America. I will
believe in whatever I like and you are welcome to your opinion, even if
it is for the most part pretty ignorant.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it sometimes takes a long time for cults to totally die out. Frank Buchman's
Oxford Group is now named
<a href="orange-rroot750.html" target="_blank">&quot;Initiatives For Change&quot;</a>,
and they still have some
die-hard old believers yammering the same nonsense and lies about how great
Frank Buchman was...
<p>
The &quot;Friends Of Bill&quot; will probably be doing that for a while too.

Subject:  	Sick mother fucker.<br>

<p>
Hi there Orange, whoever the fuck you are. Your a sick mother fucker and so
am I. Only difference is I am getting help for it and apparently you are
not. You need some serious fucking help. Like any good liar, you mix some
truth with your lies. AA is not perfect and never has been. It's a grass
roots kind of thing for sick alcoholic people. It saves lives, I see it all
the time. Your full of shit and so is the treatment center I work for. Yeah,
I'm a counselor. I agree the courts and treatment should butt out of AA, but
it's not AA's fault they send them to us, so fuck you.  AA is not a secret
society, it never has been. We are supposed to be anonymous at the level of
press, radio and film. We accomplish this most of the time. Like I said, we
are not perfect. Those that break this tradition are doing so ignorantly and
we forgive them and go on. So what's your problem? Who are you? Why do you
care? Most of us stick to this tradition.Bill had to do it for obvious
reasons. Like I said, we are not a secret society. Where did you get that
idea? Your statistics are all screwed up and so is your knowledge of this
very helpfull and very usefull program. The program is not for everyone and
was never meant to be. We, or at least I will tell newcomers to eigther keep
comeing back or go out and try some controlled drinking. Eigther way, have a
nice fucking day. I am right up front about the spiritual aspect of the
program with newcomers and the fact that not many people stay in AA. Many
alcoholics in our program or not don't make it. They die all the time. Many
others who are sent to our program are not even alcoholic and I wish they
would split as soon as they find that out. Most of them do. That may
contribute to the drop out rate a bit. I don't know for sure. You seem to
know alot of things for sure that nobody else has figured out yet, like the
statistics. It's been in debate for a very long time and still is. Most of
your rant, but not all of it, is pure bullshit. Take any organization in the
enire world, and I could pick it apart all day long just the way you have
with AA. Nothing under the sun is particularly new or perfect. AA will be
here long after you and I are gone. Period. 'nough said I suppose, but I too
can't help myself. I must express how I feel about a motherfucker like you.
That's right, I'm an AA. 18 years and counting. It's worked for me. Not
without rough spots for sure and plenty of resentments towards eigther AA or
the members, but I worked through it and so far everything is cool. I still
love AA. I love it by contributing to it. I give back what I can. We vote
all the time on changes made in AA constantly. I voice my opinion often. I
don't go along blindly. We AA's are one hell of alot smarter than you think
we are. So was Bill. Genius. Not you though, far from it.
<a name="context"> </a>
 You take things
out of the service manual and take them out of context and put your own
demented twist on it. Shame on you , fuck head. Shame on you. Who pissed in
your Cherios? What axe are you grinding? Are you an ex-member who's sponsor
fucked his wife? (It sometimes happens, unfortunately)  Whatever your
problem is I will pray for you, because obviously you are a sick mother
fucker, and so am I. I'm just glad I got help and will be forever grateful
to AA.  I hope you get help too, because it is obvious you are miserable.
Why don't you try seeing the good in stuff instead of trying to be
important. Your not very good at being a big shot. You can turn it all
around if you see the good in things others have done and point that out
too. It doesn't have to be all bad, and it clearly isn't. I know!!! Why
don't you drink a whole lot for about ten years and then go to AA- They will
straighten your ass out if anyone can. Anyway, good luck motherfucker, hope
your life gets even better than mine someday because you seriously need it.

Subject:  	Your Efforts Work, I keep coming back : )<br>

<p>
I have directed a number of people to your website and believe me for many it is an
eye opener.  I can understand why some steppers are so hostile. It is because 12
step  ideas are built on sand and once people hear about alternatives for becoming
sober they leave AA behind and move on.

<p>
When I have a conversation either face to face or on line about this I begin with
two simple truths.  I tell them that they are not powerless and that abstinence IS
the same as sobriety. Two obvious concepts that AA spends so much energy convincing
people otherwise. It takes months of brainwashing by AA to blind people to common
sense.

<p>
Once people realize that will power is their most effective tool they will see how
AA is so totally wrong.  If the person has a religion or spiritual practice I
encourage them to apply that to their efforts to abstain. If the person is an
agnostic or atheist I tell them that that is compatible with sobriety and there is
no need to change their beliefs.

<p>
One friend of mine went through AA for two years and had three slips.   Before he
began SMART Recovery he raised some issues with his sponsor. The sponsor actually
called me and told me that I should not mess with  &quot;John's program.&quot;  I basically
asked  &quot;you and what army will stop me?&quot;  My friend has now been sober (abstinent)
for almost a year.  Last Christmas he sent me a card.  In the card he said that the
moment he realized that he never had to attend an AA meeting again was the moment he
felt &quot;happy, joyous and free.&quot;

<p>
Keep up the good work and know that your website has successfully &quot;messed with
peoples AA program&quot; and helped them achieve sobriety.

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I lived at Royal Haven in Sisters, Oregon... where people called us Gage Girls.  I do
not remember Steve as being a kind, smiling, jolly old man.  He had his moments
where he was smiling but only when the public was around.  I am seriously disgusted
that the sister of a girl that I probably lived with at one point thinks he is a
good man.  There were fights over food, little shower times, CHILD LABOR, barely in
food, timed pee breaks, sweat, blood, tears, and fear.  I was happiest cause I was
part of the Fab Five.  I was safe because he said I couldn't hold a secret.  Thank
god for that.  I learned a lot about working hard, trusting no one to do anything
for you, and watch your back.  He raped, molested, and mistreated many girls that I
knew.  I didn't know about the rape until after we were sent home when it closed
down.  This Mallory girl needs to shut her face.... she didn't experience what we
did.  I'm sick to see that we share the same name.  Have her ask her sister about
quiet time, wearing pjs when we were in trouble, not being able to get out of bed to
pee at night, maybe eating twice a day, hard labor outside from eight am to five pm,
and if you were a fab five you worked until ten at the other farm, not being allowed
to talk to anyone at school, not being able to talk to most girls in your boarding
school of 25.  The best part not having your period for the most of the time you
were there because you were put on horse pills that they called vitamins..... I met
amazing girls there that I will cherish forever.... but Steve can go to hell.

Dear Mr./Ms. Orange,

<p>
I have just read your commentary on Alcoholics Anonymous as a Cult in
which you attempt to deconstruct, out of context, many quotes from Bill
Wilson insofar as its suits your original thesis.  I can't imagine what
would motivate someone to spend what must have been many hours analyzing
the Big Book and come up with such fallacious conclusions.  While it was
an interesting read, I just don't buy what you're selling.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Sean,
<p>
I do not quote things out of context. I am very careful not to distort the
meanings of what I am quoting. We have discussed that before,
<a href="orange-letters12.html#context" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters93.html#out_of_context" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
You can't imagine why someone would work to get the truth out there?
You can't imagine why someone would want to help sick people?
</font>
<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
The fact that you would take the time to ridicule something that has
helped millions of people speaks volumes about your motives.  As with
anything, including AA, as soon as human beings get involved, things can
get messy.  But that shouldn't take away from the fact that before AA,
they locked alcoholics like me up in asylums.  At least now, I have
another option.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are just parrotting the standard A.A. lies. A.A. has not &quot;helped millions&quot;,
or &quot;saved millions&quot;, or &quot;sobered up millions.&quot; I've covered that so many times
before that I will just point you to the facts,
<a href="orange-secrets.html#not_work" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Your history is a work of fiction too, just standard A.A. propaganda.
 Read this for some of the real history of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#temperance_unions" target="_blank">the treatment of alcohol abuse</a> before Bill Wilson sold Frank Buchman's religion as a quack cure for
alcoholism.
</font>

<p>
Ive been sober for many years, something which I tried many times, on my
own, and failed to do before AA.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it
infallible?  No.  Do I go to meetings everyday?  No.  Is AA the ONLY way
to get and stay sober?  No.  Do I attempt to use the basic tenet of AA
that a relationship with a higher power will help me stay sober?  Yes.
Has it worked thus far?  Yes  Am I a happier, more productive member of
society?  Yes.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are making a common logical error:
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;It happened after X, so it was caused by X&quot;.</font>
In Latin, it's called <i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>.
<p>
It works like this:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Mary never got pregnant until she went to that Baptist Church,
so that Baptist Church made Mary get pregnant.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Likewise, you think you quit drinking because you went to A.A. meetings. Wrong.<br>
<ul>
<li>
You quit drinking because you wanted to quit drinking. You finally got sick and
tired of being sick and tired, and decided to really quit, for real, forever.<br>
<li>
You also went to some A.A. meetings because you wanted to quit drinking, and somebody
had told you that A.A. was supposed to be &quot;helpful&quot; for quitting drinking.<br>
<li>
Both quitting drinking and attending A.A. meetings were caused by your desire to quit drinking.
<li>
A.A. did not make you quit drinking.
</ul>

</font>
<p>
I would just leave it at that.  I think that most people, alcoholic or
otherwise, just want to live a happy life.  So why the intellectual
bitterness on your part?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I do not have &quot;intellectual bitterness&quot;. I simply oppose cults that harm people.
I don't care if it's Scientology, the Moonies, or Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; they are all
hoaxes and frauds.

</font>
<p>
<a name="bottom"> </a>
Again, a very interesting read, but unless you've experienced a
spiritual, physical, and moral bottom as so many in AA have, you can't
realize that anything is better than that.  Call it a cult or whatever
label you want to affix, it works for many people whom otherwise would
have been lost.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And now you are pulling a cheap stunt of one-upmanship. As if your suffering was
so special that I could never understand it.
<p>
Been there, done that. I've been to hell and back too. I'm an alcoholic too.
<p>
And happily, I discovered that you don't have to join a cult religion to quit drinking
and have a happy, sober life.

Hiya, Orange.

Turns out there actually is an annual to-do commemorating Bill Wilson's sobriety
anniversary! The New York Intergroup has a yearly event called
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160517152334/http://www.nyintergroup.org/03events.cfm" target="_blank">The Big Meeting</a>:

<p>
An open three-speaker meeting that celebrates the 75th anniversary of Alcoholics
Anonymous' founding date, June 10th, 1935 (the date of A.A.'s co-founder Dr. Bob's
last drink).

<p>
There's also a glamorous affair called the Bill W. Dinner that celebrates Bill's AA
(not belly button, haw-haw!) birthday:

<p>
The Bill W. Dinner is an annual celebration of the sobriety anniversary of A.A.
co-founder, Bill W. Proceeds of the event benefit New York Inter-Group. The Dinner
was started by several of Bill's friends who were accustomed to celebrating Bill's
anniversary by taking him to dinner.

Hi Hooty,
<p>
Aha! Thanks for the information and the good wishes.
<p>
The date sounds like fun. Are you allowed to question Bill's sobriety if you wear
a tux?
<p>
The party for Bill sounds interesting, but it isn't at all clear whether it was
just a cover-up or a publicity stunt, or if Bill really had that many years of
unbroken sobriety.
<p>
We have other reports that the fellow members covered up for Bill when Bill did something
that would embarass the A.A. organization.
Tom Powers, the co-author of &quot;Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions&quot;, explained

Bill's sexual affairs</a>:

he had worked for. But then people would scurry around and
smooth things over, or cover it all up.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W., A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous
Co-Founder Bill Wilson</i>, Francis Hartigan, 2000, pages 171-172.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And then there was <a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Founders_Watch" target="_blank">the Founder's Watch Committee</a>, that followed Bill Wilson around and tried to prevent
him from embarassing the A.A. organization yet again by
seducing another cute young thing who came to an A.A. meeting
seeking help with a drinking problem...
<p>
So did they also cover up Bill's occasional drinking? Were they just pretending that
Bill had so many years of unbroken sobriety?

<p>
<a name="LSD">
Oh, and did they reset Bill's sobriety date when he took LSD for two years?
&#8212; an indulgence which is well known and well-documented
(look <a href="orange-letters89.html#LSD" target="_blank">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters89.html#LSD2" target="_blank">here</a>).
<p>
I have heard some
A.A. apologists rationalize and minimize Bill's LSD consumption by saying,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, it was legal at the time.&quot;
</font>
Yes, and so was alcohol, after Prohibition ended.
Nevertheless, the common A.A. attitude today is that you lose all of your sober time if
you take drugs like LSD.
So did they reset Bill's sobriety date? If not, why not?
<p>
Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>
And then there is this curiosity. The Hazelden Foundation wrote an &quot;autobiography&quot;
of Bill Wilson that was based on a bunch of autobiographical audio tapes that Bill Wilson
made before his death, where he told his story once again.
The book ends with this strange statement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There will be future historical revelations about Bill's character
and behavior in recovery that will be interpreted, by some,
as direct attacks on the very foundation of AA.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Bill W., My First 40 Years</i>, &quot;William G. Wilson&quot;
(posthumously ghost-written by Hazelden staff), Hazelden, page 170.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So what the heck are they hiding in those locked and sealed historical archives?
What &quot;future historical revelations&quot; will leak out?
Is it:
<ol>
<li> that Bill Wilson was in the habit of kidnapping, raping and murdering little
girls when the moon got full? I don't think so.
<li> that Bill Wilson was in league with Adolf Hitler in a plot to take over the world?
I don't think so.
<li> that Bill Wilson wasn't really sober? Hmmm, that might be it.
That would be a bombshell. I can see why they would hide that in the archives, and lock the door.
</ol>
<p>
Oh, and is
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">that story, on page 135 of the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
about a chain-smoking A.A. member getting drunk and throwing a screaming
temper tantrum because his wife nagged him to quit smoking,
really an autobiographical story about Bill Wilson?
<p>
Inquiring minds want to know.
<p>
Have a good day.

Mr. Orange,
Thank  you for all you do.  I have my doubts about the number
of years Bill W was  sober.  You made a good point asking where are the
records of his  anniversaries?  I found some interesting claims at

<p>
Greetings,

<p>
My name is Kean Tran, and I am the Public Awareness Director for
PleuralMesothelioma.com. While I was browsing through a number of health sites, I
came across your website and was very impressed by the information you have listed.

<p>
Pleural mesothelioma is the most common type of mesothelioma, a rare cancer that
develops in the lungs. It is almost solely caused by exposure to asbestos, which was
used in everything in children's toys, house-hold insulation, and naval carriers.
Our website has the most up to date and comprehensive information about Pleural
Mesothelioma on the web today.  With information ranging from a complete list of
symptoms, to treatment options, and steps to take after a diagnosis.

<p>
I noticed that you already had some other health related resources listed on your
resources page at &quot;orange-papers.info/orange-links.html&quot; and figured you might be
interested in including a link to our site as well. Please let me know if you are
interested &#8212; I'm available by e-mail at ktran(@)pleuralmesothelioma.com. With your
help, we can educate the public about the dangers of asbestos and hopefully save
some lives.  Thanks again!

<p>
Best Regards,

<p>
Kean Tran<br>
Public Awareness Director<br>
PleuralMesothelioma.com<br>

Okay, Kean,
<p>
I'll add that link. Thank you for your work.

Subject:  	Curious<br>

<p>
I looked at your site &#8212; specifically
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html &#8212;  and didn't find any
reference to this well documented item from the National Institutes of Health,<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160517152334/http://oas.samhsa.gov/2k8/selfHelp/selfHelp.htm" target="_blank">
http://oas.samhsa.gov/2k8/selfHelp/selfHelp.htm</a>.<br>
  It is based on a very large data
sample- 135,672 persons &#8212; and seems to contradict a lot of the research you quote,
which are based on samples that are several orders of magnitude smaller. I can't
find any data that you present on
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.htm that employs a sample larger
than a few hundred.  The NSDUH report is based on a sample that is three orders of
magnitude larger than the studies you quote, and thus likely to  have greater
statistical significance.

<p>
Are you ignoring this science because it does not support your beliefs?

<p>
<font color="blue">
[ local copy here: <a href="OAS.SAMHSA.GOV--selfHelp.htm" target="_blank">OAS.SAMHSA.GOV--selfHelp.htm</a> ]
<p>

Hello Bill,
<p>
Obviously, you do not know what the word &quot;SCIENCE&quot; means.
There was no science in that article.
<p>
Do you know how you can tell if something is scientific? Simple: Look for this key phrase:
&quot;CONTROL GROUP&quot;.  Synonyms of &quot;control group&quot; are:
&quot;untreated group&quot;, or &quot;untreated patients&quot;,
or &quot;the patients who didn't get any of the experimental medicine&quot;.
<p>
That brings up another key word that is missing from that article: EXPERIMENT.

<p>
The &quot;scientific method&quot; requires that you observe a phenomenon or situation, and form a
hypothesis about what you are seeing, and then do an experiment to reveal what the
truth really is.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Your hypothesis might be that a certain chemical or treatment will cure a disease. That leads to
performing a medical experiment, or &quot;A CLINICAL STUDY&quot;.
<p><li>
In the case of medical experiments, where you are testing a new medicine or treatment,
you always have <b><i>two identical groups of patients</i></b>,
only one of which gets the new medicine or treatment,
while the other group does not get it. The medical treatment of the two groups is otherwise
the same.

<p><li>
The patients that go into the two groups must be selected randomly. No cherry-picking is allowed,
where the most promising patients get the medicine or treatment to be tested.
Pick names out of a hat, or roll dice, or let a computer program select the names.

<p><li>
The group of patients that does not get the experimental medicine
or treatment is called &quot;the control group&quot;.
The results from the control group tell you how many patients just got over the
disease, and recovered spontaneously, without the new medicine or treatment.
(It's called &quot;spontaneous remission&quot;.)

<p><li>
The results from the treated group tell you how many people recovered with the help of
the new medicine or treatment.

<p><li>
To determine whether the medicine or treatment works, and how well it works,
you compare the results from the two groups.
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> If the treated group did better than the untreated group, then the medicine is doing
something good and is helping the patients.
<p><li> If there is no difference between the two groups, then the medicine is completely
ineffective and useless.
<p><li> If the treated group does worse than the control group, then the medicine is poisonous
and is killing the patients. Throw it into the toxic waste dump.
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
I also wrote up a description of how you do a <i><b>Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</b></i>,
earlier,
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Now, back to the article that you cited.
If you read that article carefully, you will see that there were no experiments to
see whether self-help groups really caused people to stop drinking or consuming drugs.
The authors just presented the results of ONE QUESTION that was included in a survey:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) includes a question
for persons aged 12 or older about their participation in the past 12
months in a self-help group for substance use (i.e., alcohol use,
illicit drug use, or both).<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You seem to believe that the numbers somehow show that self-help groups were
doing something positive, but the numbers don't show any such thing.

<p>
What that paper shows us is merely that a bunch of white people, more men than women,
mostly between 28 and 45 years of age, went to a bunch of self-help meetings,
and only half of them were actually drug and alcohol-free for even one
lousy month. That is really pathetic.
<p>
(Oh, and that totally contradicts
<a href="orange-letters158.html#mean" target="_blank">the grandiose Alcoholics Anonymous claim</a>
that the average sobriety of A.A. members is 8 years.)
<p>
There was no evidence that going to self-help groups reduced consumption
of drugs and alcohol. None. Nada. Zilch. Zip. I challenge you to find any such evidence
in that report.

<p>
Nevertheless, the unnamed (anonymous?) author finished by suddenly proclaiming
that self-help groups had done great things,
when he had zero evidence of any such thing.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A substantial body of research has found that attendance at self-help
groups improves substance use outcomes, mainly in the form of reductions
in the amount used and increases in rates of
abstinence.<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>
Self-help
groups often are used in conjunction with specialty treatment and also
continue beyond treatment as people go through the recovery
process.<font size="-1"><sup>6</sup></font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What &quot;substantial body of research&quot;? There isn't any.
The author vaguely referred to some propaganda pieces that were
cranked out by the 12-Step promoters that are listed in the bibliography.
That is what you call fraud.  It's just another hidden 12-Stepper promoting his
favorite cult again, using deception and misinformation.
It's no better than Tom Cruise selling Scientology as the cure for all of your
mental problems.

<p>
That is the most &quot;nothing&quot; report that I've seen in a while.
But thanks for the reference. I'll have to read more and see whether they
are running a 12-Step propaganda mill over at SAMHSA.
<p>
Oh, and so what were the results of the properly-done tests of
Alcoholics Anonymous? I'm so glad you asked.
The results were disastrous:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, the A.A. Trustee,
found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective, and raised the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ol>

<p>
In fact, there has never been a single valid medical study that showed
that attending A.A. meetings helped alcoholics to get better. No one. Not ever.
<p>
And for eight years now, I've had a challenge out, asking the A.A. true believers to show
me even one properly-conducted clinical study or Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study that
showed that A.A. did anything good for the alcoholics. And all that I have ever gotten back is
some references to some faked &quot;studies&quot;, often by
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">Humphries</a>,
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="_blank">Moos</a>
and gang (who is also in the bibliography of the article that you cited).

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
