<p>

Agent-Orange,
<p>
Thanks so much for the effort you put into your papers and web site.  I
have been through the 12-step treatment programs and feel these are one
of the most criminal institutions in the world.   I could hop on my soap
box for days about this.  There are very few people who stand up and
tell the truth about this politically correct and taboo 'Recovery'
industry.   I wish to leave you with nothing more than a thanks.  The
thought of a group of people trying to help each other with a common
problem is great... this is not what these 12-step programs are about.
They consist of sick twisted individuals that live AA every waking
moment (and have no clue about life outside of AA) and dictate
or humiliate others.  I have been out of AA for 3 months and have not
been happier.  I still have some work to do, but it is my work and not
the work of a depressed psychotic sponsor.

<p>

AA has no accountabity but has a LOT of money.  Very sad how the courts
toss people there.  I have seen to many people kill themselves in AA,
but never once had a diehard drinking buddy kill themself.  I VERY MUCH
believe that it is AA that kills people!!!!!   Including very famous
people that I have known.

<p>

AA Sucks!!!  And should be investigated,<br>
Jeff W. &#8212; Happy w/out AA doctrine.

Hi Jeff,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I couldn't agree more.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	A.A.

<p>
I appreciate that you put so much time and thought into this persuasive
work, and I'm glad you are standing up for your beliefs. Still, I'm a member
of A.A. and I believe in Heaven and Hell, so I think I'll keep working the
program, even if it is a cult, as you are convinced it is.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jonathan,
<br>
Thanks for the letter. Well, you know, I believe in
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil" target="_blank">Heaven and Hell</a>
too,
and that's why I'm not a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>

<p>
In section #80 you wrote that the promises never come true because you
never get half way through step ten, which would be true if the promises
were said to come halfway through step ten, but aren't they said to come
half way through step nine? (p.83) And, if I'm reading that correctly, we
certainly can get halfway through our amends.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You know, you are right. He begins the Promises on page 83 and
continues into page 84, and then starts on Step 10 in the next sentence
immediately after declaring, &quot;Are these extravagant promises? We think not.&quot;
and then making yet another promise:
&quot;They will always materialize if we work for them.&quot;
I'll have to correct that.
</font>

<p>
Also, in section #31, about the alleged misrepresentation of A.A. history,
you said that A.A. does not talk about Dr. Buchman and his supposed sympathy
for the Nazis, but &quot;Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers&quot; (the A.A. conference
approved book) reveals all of that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't remember that as having been anything more than a mild gloss-over and cover-up. I'll have to
get my hands on that book again and re-read that section.
<p>
And the historical truth is that
it really was not a case of <i>&quot;Dr. Buchman and his supposed sympathy for the Nazis&quot;</i>.
There was nothing &quot;supposed&quot; about it.
That's the kind of gloss-over and minimization and denial that I object to. The truth is that
Dr. Frank Buchman was in Nuremberg at the Nazi Party rallies year after year,
<i>Sieg-Heiling</i> Hitler with the rest of them</a>.
Check out the &quot;<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">Partying with the Nazi Party</a>&quot;
chapter of the new expanded history of the Oxford Group that I just uploaded.
And Frank Buchman was very chummy with Heinrich Himmler, and
was Himmler's personal guest at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
A contemporary journalist, Robert Byron, wrote in his diary that
&quot;Himmler apparently dotes on the Oxford Group and writes to its English members discussing
their troubles with them.&quot;
<p>
And above all, Frank Buchman was a Nazi apologist who never criticized
Adolf Hitler, no matter how many people Hitler killed. Buchman actually
managed to
<a href="orange-rroot390.html" target="_blank">&quot;patriotically&quot; wave the flag
all through World War II</a>
without ever criticizing Hitler or the Nazis.

<p>
In addition, Frank Buchman was not the only fascist in the Oxford Group. It was full of them.
Peter Howard, who took over the leadership of the organization when Buchman died, was an old
fascist who was a member of Sir Oswald Mosley's <i>New Party</i>, which morphed into the B.U.F. &#8212;
the British Union of Fascists, and Peter Howard was the leader of the New Youth Movement,
Sir Oswald Mosley's copy of the <i>Hitlerjugend</i>.
<p>
Reinhold Niebuhr, the eminent theologian who wrote the <i>Serenity Prayer</i>,
strongly criticized Frank Buchman for pro-Hitler and pro-Nazi sympathies.
Niebuhr wrote an article called &quot;Hitler and Buchman&quot; for <i>The Christian Century</i>
magazine in 1936, in which he declared,
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot870.html#Niebuhr_article" target="_blank">In other words, a
Nazi social philosophy has been a covert presumption of the whole Oxford
group enterprise from the very beginning.</a>&quot;
<p>
There just isn't any doubt about the fascist sympathies of the whole
Oxford Group. It is well-established documented facts and verified history, but the A.A.
leaders and propagandists are still doing the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank"><i>Minimization and Denial</i></a>
tap-dance about the whole thing, and won't be &quot;rigorously honest&quot;.
To say <i>&quot;Dr. Buchman and his supposed sympathy&quot;</i> is grossly dishonest.

<p>
It's just like how 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#AAWS_Buchman" target="_blank">in <i>PASS IT ON</i>,
the AAWS staff deceptively wrote</a>
<font size="-1">(page 170)</font>,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;In August [1936], the New York <i>World-Telegram</i> published an article
about Buchman, charging that he was pro-Nazi.&quot;</font><br>
No, the <i>World-Telegram</i> published <i>an interview, not an article</i>,
where they <b><i>quoted</i></b>
Frank Buchman while
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_interview" target="_blank">Frank Buchman enthusiastically praised Adolf Hitler
and declared that all of our problems
&quot;could be solved through a God-controlled Fascist dictatorship.&quot;</a><br>
There is a big difference there. AAWS was being dishonest again.
And that's &quot;Conference-approved literature&quot;.
</font>

<p>
Also, no reasonable A.A. is very shaken
upon learning that the founders did terrible things. They preached &quot;progress
not perfection&quot; and they seemed to have progessed as much as any human in
their situation could have been expected to progress.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is still a strong tendency among the true believers
to declare that Bill and Dr. Bob were saints who brought a New Message From God.
They weren't, and somebody had better tell the truth about all of that.
</font>
<p>
Also, p. 212 of &quot;Dr.
Bob and the Good Oldtimers&quot; says, &quot;Some think... Dr. Bob was a bit of an
autocrat...&quot; and on p.288 Joe was quoted as having said that, &quot;Doc was
extremely democratic...&quot; In any case, if untruths improve people's lives,
and there's no downside, then what's so wrong with that?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you have just hit on one of the worst characteristics of Alcoholics Anonymous:
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_end_justifies" target="_blank">the end justifies the means</a>&quot;.
They falsely claim that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">they have a great success rate</a>
and have saved millions of alcoholics, and then they claim that despicable practices
like
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">coercive recruiting</a>,
lying about the success rate,
and
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_dishonesty" target="_blank">rewriting history</a>
are all okay because A.A. saves so many millions of alcoholics &#8212;
&quot;it helps them&quot; &#8212; &quot;it's for their own good&quot;.
That is simply all a lie,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">the Big Lie</a> of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Oh, by the way, the true-believer A.A. authors of &quot;Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers&quot; used the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial trick</a> when they
declared that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Some think... Dr. Bob was a bit of an autocrat...&quot;</font>.
As if, well, a few stupid jerks think it, but what do they know?....
<p>
Actually,
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Susans_quotes" target="_blank">Dr. Bob's daughter Susan wrote</a>
that he was an autocratic authoritarian sadistic fool
who whittled a wooden paddle with which to beat his children, modifying it so that it would hurt more.
That is a lot more serious than it being a case of &quot;just a few
uninformed people think that maybe Dr. Bob was a bit of an autocrat.&quot;
</font>

<p>
God either is, or he isn't, and I choose to believe he is. By believing, you
lose nothing, and if you're right, you gain something that is infinitely
good and valuable. You would probably take up bets any day in which you
risked much more than nothing, and would stand to gain much, much, less than
something infinitely good and infinitely valuable.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I have no objections to you believing in God. In fact, I do too.
I also believe in something that I would call general morality, or everyday ethics,
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">
I see A.A. as an organization violating such moral, ethical, and spiritual principles all of the time</a>.
</font>
<p>

I hope to see you at meetings. Until then, if you can stay sober
and relatively happy and productive, my hat is off to you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thank you. Yeh, I'm staying clean and sober. I am only
2 weeks away from my 5th anniversary. I also have 5 years off of tobacco,
thank God for small favors.
<p>
But I don't know if you'll see me at a meeting, not even to pick up my 5-Year coin.
I still haven't bothered to go to an A.A. meeting to pick up coins for years 2, 3, or 4.
</font>

<p>
(sorry for the spelling and grammatical errors, but it's one a.m.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's all right. I have that problem too. (I just get a lot of second
and third chances to run spell-checkers and re-read and finally catch all of those things.)
</font>
<p>

P.S. I take a mood stabilizer and an anti-psychotic for bipolar, and I have
been clean and sober for a little over fourteen months, and as far as I can
tell from all of the A.A. literature, and the pertinent pamphlets,
everything is as it should be. The Big Book says, &quot;Try to remember that
though God has wrought miracles among us, we should never belittle a good
doctor or psychiatrist. Their services are often indispensable in treating a
necomer and in following his case afterward,&quot; (p.133 The Family Afterward).
(PLEASE make sure that the friend you wrote about who has a mental illness
knows about both this last quote, and the A.A. pamphlet about medications. I
pray and hope that he will take his meds regularly.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, that is the contradiction
(or <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#doctors" target="_blank">bait-and-switch stunt</a>).
In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson very clearly
told people to go to doctors and get treated, and yet so many fanatics today are
harming sponsees with
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#no_medications" target="_blank">this no-medications nonsense</a>,
even killing people.
And that has been going on for
so many years. I hear that, around 1990 or so, the A.A. headquarters sent out a
memo telling the sponsors to stop instructing their sponsees not to take their
doctor-prescribed medications,
but the sponsors just ignored that request and kept on doing it anyway.
(I'd love to get a copy of that memo; maybe somebody has one.)

<p>
Heck, Carolyn See, who was the step-daughter of <a href="orange-otherwomen.html#WynnC" target="_blank">Wynn Corum</a>,
who was the authoress of the <i>Big Book</i> story <i>&quot;Freedom From Bondage&quot;</i>,
reported that during her childhood, she heard the early A.A. members bickering over whether
taking aspirin for a headache was a slip from pure sobriety.
<p>
This seems to be one of those cases where there is a big difference between what is written
on paper and what the real traditions are.
</font>

<p>
Take Care,<br>
Jonathan

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I will, thank you, and you take care too. And have a good day.

Subject:  	Nice Site

<p>

Hello Orange,

<p>

Very nice and extensive and easy to explore site. I really am impressed
with the documentation of source info. I also like the ease of clicking
on a word linked to another page. Very Coool and very helpful. Have you
ever published a formal book for store's? And what's with the anonymity?
I'm sure you are familiar with support groups like LSR; lifering secular
recovery.  Personally I think it would add to credibility if you did and
did away with that Orange Secret... whatever when I went to the main
page. If I saw that before looking at the other stuff, I might have gone
no further. Thinking that it was just crap and not of quality. Your site
is of quality. I think you should reconsider and drop that part and put
a real name up there.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Rich,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for all of the complements.
<p>
Yes, I get a few requests now and then for a printed book. Alas, I can't
help but feel like paper is obsolete. The links don't work.
It would take so much surgery to prepare a book for the printing press that
I don't know if it's work the effort. It would be a very low-volume book.
<p>
What I do is suggest that people download all of the archive files so that they
will have the entire website, and then burn CDs. (The archive files are listed on
the main menu page.)
<p>
About the &quot;Secret Agent Orange&quot; thing:
Yes, I have thought of abandoning it, and I will someday.
Part of my reason for remaining anonymous is that I am in the heart of
the beast right now, in a &quot;recovery community&quot;, and I don't need rabid Steppers gunning
for me, thanks anyway.
(And I'm not just being paranoid, either.
Charles Bufe, who wrote one of the first good expos&eacute;s
of A.A.,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cult_or_cure" target="_blank"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?</i></a>,
had his garage torched by an arsonist last year.
The fire destroyed most of his files on A.A.. Gee, what a coincidence.)

<p>
I don't know a lot about LSR. I have heard good things about them, but have no experience.
I have poked in there a few times, and shall again.
I need to wrack up a lot more Internet cruising time.
Up until a few weeks ago, I was extremely limited in my connectivity to the Internet,
and didn't have much browsing time. Now I have a WiFi card and am able to connect to
a free server that is very unreliable, but at least it still lets me get in there
and get some stuff done now and then.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	info request<br>

<p>

can you provide me with direct linkage between Bill, or Bob, with
Bachman. I'm in AA, I'm considered a heretic by many, and I find we
share many of the same concerns.  I don't believe in sacred cows and a
Mother Theresa is not hiding behind every bush waiting to jump out and
save us.
<p>
Cheers

<p>

Ric O.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ric,
<p>
The simplest and most obvious linkage is that Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith both
joined Frank Buchman's cult religion, and they liked it so much that they stole it and
made it their own cult. Alcoholics Anonymous is just the Oxford Group dressed up in
a shabbier suit of clothes.
See
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">the history of A.A. and the Oxford Group, here</a>.

<p>
I get the feeling that you might be thinking of face-to-face contact.
That was rare. The story I hear is that Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson may have met
a few times, and shook hands once. When Frank Buchman was in New York City, Bill
Wilson served as an usher at one of Frank's affairs.
<p>
But in general, Buchman and Wilson lived in two different worlds. Frank Buchman
liked to hang out with millionaires, kings, queens, and princes, and he had little
use for poor alcoholics.
<p>
The person who did have a lot of contact with Bill Wilson was Rev. Sam Shoemaker, the
number two man in the Oxford Group.
Sam Shoemaker was a very different sort of man than Frank Buchman. Shoemaker ran a
rescue mission for down-and-out alcoholics in New York City, Calvary House, as well
as running his own Episcopal church,
Calvary Church at Fourth Ave and 21st St.,
and also managing the American branch of the Oxford
Group. Bill Wilson and Sam Shoemaker knew each other well, and Bill and his wife Lois
went to services and Oxford Group meetings at Sam's church. That is well-documented history.
<p>
I hope that answers your question.
<p>
have a good day.

Subject:  	Your Article About Twelve Step Programs

<p>

Wow!  I have been resistant to AA/NA for the kind of reasons you discuss
in your article.  I quit using cocaine without therapy or a support
group when I was hooked on it in the Big 80's.  Later I developed a
dependency on sleeping meds and also quit those on my own.
Nevertheless, I have AA members in my life who insist I will relapse
without using the twelve steps and going to meetings.

<p>

What is your own background?  What are the Orange Papers?  I'd like to
know more.

<p>

Thanks,<br>
Heather G.

<font color="blue">
Hi Heather,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well and keeping your head above water.
<p>
And of course you can continue to abstain from drugs without joining a cult.
You didn't need them when you quit, and you don't need them now.
<p>
My background? That's complicated, because I am so many things. That is,
no one label says it all. I am, among other things, the
son of an alcoholic military sergeant, also an old hippie, also an old computer programmer,
also an alcoholic or ex-alcoholic, depending on which wording you prefer.
And I'm also somebody who saw through the hoax and got sober without A.A. or any
such &quot;program&quot;.
<p>
I have been asked who or what I am many times, so I have a bunch of fragments
<a href="orange-letters18.html#biography" target="_blank">here and there</a>.

<p>
What are the Orange Papers? Just my writings, my take on the whole subject.

Hi Heather,
<p>
Thanks for the tip.<br>
That's a very good article. So much true and good information.
<p>
The *only* disagreement I have with her is the line,
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous has been good to some people.&quot;<br>
Perhaps she felt like she had to throw that mollifier out
there to appease the wolves, before she went on to criticize
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
I would reword that and say, &quot;Some people have recovered while
going to A.A. meetings, but there is no evidence that they recovered
*because of* the A.A. meetings or the 12-Step program.&quot;<br>
All of the medical research shows that they will recover
at the same rate in *anything else*.

Well, thanks again for the tip. Have a good day.

Subject:  	Meetings<br>

<p>

Hey Orange!
I was looking through your site for any references to what you do at
meetings, and could not see any headings like that. I am beginning to
state some facts that I discovered in researching your site at meetings
I go to, and so far have been called an asshole, lol. Also, that person
told me to keep coming back, presumably because more would be revealed
(by god through AA/NA people) and I would see the light. I have been
going to meetings for 12 years and have some years of sobriety too, so I
found myself a little resentful at being treated as a newbie!
<p>
To be fair, I called Bill Wilson a lying, cheating, stealing, carousing
asshole at an NA meeting, so I suppose I can expect some harsh words
directed at me. But I was wondering what you do and say when you go to
meetings.
<p>
It is not my intent to hurt anyone, they are mostly ignorant of what
they have accepted as gospel, so must be treated more gently than those
who are truly self-appointed gurus, in my opinion. My intent is to tell
the truth so that less people get more hurt by AA/NA.
<p>


Burton H.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Burton,
<p>
Good for you. It's fun to hear of somebody telling the truth now and then.
<p>
Your problem sounds so familiar. I have pretty much decided not to go to A.A. meetings
any more, simply because I can't really tell the truth there.
Oh, I could cause a scene, but what's the point?

<p>
There is just such a huge gulf between what they believe is true and what I believe or know is true
that there is little common ground to talk about.
My approach to sobriety is a 180 degree reversal of most everything that they believe.
We could spend hours and days and months or years arguing, but would that help anyone?
<p>
I am more than willing to tell the truth to anyone who wants to hear it,
so I do this web site.

<p>
The basic problem is just that a lot of people really don't want to hear the truth.
They just want their favorite beliefs repeated. That is not just a problem with A.A.;
it is actually a very common problem with humanity in general. 
It just shows up more strongly in some kinds of groups, particularly in cult religions
and extremist political parties, but it is everywhere to some extent.
<p>
My favorite book on that subject is
<a href="orange-top10.html#Deikman" target="_blank">
<i>The Wrong Way Home, Uncovering the Patterns of
Cult Behavior in American Society</i></a>, by
Arthur J. Deikman, M.D..
Dr. Deikman was on a Congressional committee that studied cults after
the Jonestown mass suicide and the murder of Congressman Leo J. Ryan,
and one of the disturbing facts that he
noticed was that cultish behavior was not restricted to cult religions. It was
present to some degree in many of our institutions &#8212; even government agencies
and the White House. He did post-mortems on both Kennedy's Bay of Pigs fiasco
and Ronald Reagan's Iran-Contra Arms For Hostages and Contra Cocaine for Guns disasters.
In both cases he found cultish behavior leading people down the primrose path.
In both administrations there was suppression of dissent, devaluing the outsider,
dependence on a charismatic leader, and demands for compliance with the group.
The result was that people just believed that what they were doing was right,
and nothing could go wrong.

<p>
So anyway, what is my solution to the problem? Either go to a SMART meeting, or just don't
go to any meetings at all. They aren't really necessary.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi John,
<p>
Do you really have to ask why?<br>
Have you read the web page

You could start with that and it will tell you 'why'.

Subject:  	AA news flash: Madame Senga gets CURED! Whoa!

<p>

(Note: I just sent a similar version  of this to another website,
Positive Atheist, I confused the two
of you!  Hope thats OK to resend here?  I just want to add my two cents
wherever I can on this cult).
<p>
<font color="blue">

Sure, no problem.
</font>
<p>

<p>

Dear A. Orange:

<p>

I love your website! THANK YOU! To qualify myself: I'm 48 and
I have been in AA for 14 and �  years. I've been an active female member
and I've been a key member  in founding meetings and even helped
found an entire fellowship that is still on &#8212; going for over ten years
now. Having said all that:

<p>

When I first came into AA in 1991 I was immediately struck by its
patriarchal oppressive
nature and its overt &quot;christian&quot; tone. I never agreed with the concept
that I should suppress all forms of (my) anger and other strong emotion.
(Like you, I think anger can be a healthy form of expression. AA makes
it a crime!) And did not agree that every time I was victimized that I
always had &quot;a part in it&quot;. Neither did I let my first sponsor insist I
be &quot;on my knees to God&quot; as the &quot;best way&quot; &#8212; pagans stand and face the
directions. All the same, I stuck around, desperate to stay sober &#8212; but an
outspoken member who announced herself as &quot;pagan&quot;, read &quot;He&quot; as &quot;She&quot;
(or &quot;he/she&quot;) at meeting level and amused members by chanting a
feminized version of the Lords Prayer at the end of every meeting. I
think one reason I survived in AA this long has something to do with the
fact I went long periods in between sponsors and have only ever had two.
(Being independent minded, I thought it absurd to consult someone else
on every little detail of how to live my  life, once I quit drinking.) I did
pretty well following my own instincts. Both women proved, ultimately to
be a let down; and one was down right disturbing.

<p>

It has been my observation, as a woman in AA, that turning my thoughts
and life over to
the care of another female addict who is usually sicker than I could
ever hope to be... and allowing her to run my life, is not healthy for
me &#8212; or any woman, or anyone! Most of these women in 12step have never
confronted their own &quot;slave mentality&quot; as it has been cultivated in our
male-dominated culture. My observation is they all still adhere (albeit
perhaps often unconsciously)  to the culturally imposed misogynistic
parameters &#8212; which AA reinforces via its religiosity! (YES, it is
religious &#8212; not just spiritual!) Knowing that, how could I trust any of
them with running MY life? I think sponsorship should really be called
The Sick Puppet Master Syndrome. (As written, AA dogma makes it
conducive for sponsors to meddle in all aspects of one's life, you can't
get around that if it says drinking is a &quot;moral issue&quot; that pervades the
addict's entire life. That's a &quot;green light&quot; for bullying on the
sponsor's part, right there. They're compelled then to look at everything
you do because your alcoholic stinking thinking tainted it, all of it.
Supposedly.)

<p>

My first sponsor, an elder statesman of many years (well over twenty
years sober) tried to pressure me into staying in an ill-matched
relationship with a &quot;nice guy&quot; via her dismissive comments. The
depression caused from following her advice almost &quot;did me in&quot;. (I had
revealed to her I still had feelings for another who had &quot;left the
fold&quot;.) When I finally insisted I was breaking up with this (more
respectable/approved) member and did not believe in having regrets over
that decision (she kept hinting I would have regrets if I acted rashly,
&quot;you're not getting any younger, you know&quot;) she cried out in
astonishment &quot;Have no regrets?? You can't say that! You're not GOD!!&quot;
She then informed me &#8212; get this! &#8212; that:&quot;Well, if you're going to break up
with him, you need to sit down and figure out what took you so long! Ask
yourself why this relationship went on as long as it did!&quot;  I was only
in this relationship a little over 18 months, I had begun to have doubts
several months prior to the break up &#8212; SHE was the reason &quot;it took me so
long!&quot; (And besides: How many times do I have to
over-analyze a breakup?? Obviously I'd already given it heavy thought!
What? Now I have to
analyze the analysis?? I'm sorry, I'm not that obsessive.) By the way, I
have NEVER regretted the break up and while I remain single I'm happy to
report this (indeed, decent) man whom I remained on good terms with,
having let him down as gently as possible, is now in the happiest
relationship of his life, a much better match for him. MY instincts were
correct &#8212; and with way less &quot;sobriety&quot; under my belt than my sponsor.

<p>
<a name="OA"> </a>
My second sponsor many years later, proved to be the Sponsor from Hell.
Initially
nurturing and sweet (I bonded with her so well, I was going to her house
once a week) she turned on me when I was laid off  from my job along
with 35 other people. It was the  first time I had ever been laid off
in 31 years of employment, having worked since I was sixteen to put food
on the table for my family way back when.  (I say that to illustrate my
level of responsibility, even into my drinking years.) Twelve days into
my unemployment, I had hit the ground running! Was attending resume
seminars, had my resume up on websites, dry cleaned the interview
clothes and was &quot;upping&quot; my meetings  and remaining positive. This
sponsor having witnessed my chirpy progress. proceeded
to go ballistic on me all in one day &#8212; making repeated harassing/growling
phone calls and making up, out of  her own head, frightening &quot;facts&quot;
about how I was &quot;in danger&quot;, responsible for my own job loss, &quot;letting
my anger keep me from working on my resume&quot;(??), lazy, incapable of
finding a job
on my own and behaving like a &quot;sixteen year old.&quot; (An interesting
comment, considering how responsible I had been AS a sixteen year old!)
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Good thing I wasn't a newcomer or
she could have done major damage turning on me like that when I was
&quot;down&quot;. As with the first sponsor, she applied a &quot;one size fits all&quot;
addict profile to me without knowing my history and disregarding what
she did know. It broke my heart but I had enough self respect this time
to bellow back  at the old biddy, when she wouldn't let up, &quot;Enough!
YOU'RE FIRED!&quot; This woman, like so many others I know,  is a member of
numerous Step groups: OA, Al-Anon and Couples in Recovery. And, I've
come to realize, like most Steppers &#8212; is HIGHLY DISTURBED. It is now my
deeply held belief sponsorship is dangerously crippling to the
vulnerable addict and just a case of The Confused Dominating the
Soon-to-be More Confused.  Deranged minds should not be handed that kind
of power over others. 12Step does just that, shame on it!

<p>

I could go on and on &#8212; and maybe I will. Like the author Elayne Rapping,
I began to observe at a more and more alarming rate, how many women
around me, including two best friends, were trading in their sense of
self for a &quot;more regressive worldview&quot;. These ladies were allowing the
diplomas they studied for in sobriety (one in law and one in child
psychology) to gather dust while they made the Circuit of 12step.
(AA-OA-Al-Alon. &#8212; start over.) It began to dawn on me as my political
activism took off, and they, among many, pulled away from me in
flustered embarrassment &#8212; that women like these two were living for the
applause of the group and its vacuous vicious cycle of Narcissistic
Navel Gazing. Their own private lives might have been a mess &#8212; but if
they could attend OA and lose weight, suppress all signs of  anger and
submit to the elder statesman alpha white males in AA &#8212; whether they truly
agreed with their pontificating or not! &#8212; then they &quot;looked good&quot; to the
group, received the group's approval and admiration &#8212; and that was enough,
apparently. They were slim and smiling &#8212; what more could society ask of
them? (I begin to wonder at Ira Levin's choice in naming that fictitious
town STEPford! Seriously, could there be a connection? I now wonder). In
looking back on my relationship with these two and others,  I now
realize in the dozen plus years I've known them I have never seen
change. They are still the same high-maintenance, self-absorbed, plastic
souls they always were! All they learned how to do was wear &quot;the mask&quot;
society and AA asked of them. So much for that &quot;Spiritual Awakening&quot;!
I've started to lose touch with them but near as I can see all they've ever
added to their lives is more and more 12Step groups. For all I know
they're now in CODA, GA
and SLA as well. (Well maybe its just as well the one doesn't practice
law and the other is not
in charge of a child's well-being...)

<p>

These last 2 to 3 years in the fellowship have been hell. Sheer hell,
that I  mistakenly was duped into thinking I needed to endure for &quot;my
sobriety's&quot; sake! Hah! The war  (and other issues like gay marriage)
brought out the racist, see-no-evil side of AA big time! I never brought
up politics at meeting level. But just a hint of my progressive leanings
at casual &quot;gatherings after the meetings&quot; would cause the alpha male
Steppers to verbally circle and attack me like sharks, taking chunks out
of me, while others &#8212; meek betas and omegas in the pack &#8212; looked on
passively and looked away &#8212; my so-called friends, leaving me to my
fate!) I have gone from an entire fellowship of so-called &quot;close&quot;
friends down to 3 or 4 trusted friends in sobriety, while seeking
support and refuge in the Peace and Humanist movements. I got sick of
hearing that, regarding the war, &quot;this too shall pass&quot; from silk sheet
drunks who have never had a bomb dropped on them. One idiot tried to
tell me he was not in a war zone because &quot;that's not God's lesson for me
today.&quot; !!?! (And it's a lesson for the Iraqis and their children??) AA
has literally raised up a hidden army of &quot;Conformist Zombies for God&quot;
that is right up there with the rest of the Religious Right. They are
VERY DANGEROUS  in their complacent citizenry &#8212; probably as dangerous as
any &quot;born again&quot; zealot, in their own way &#8212; and as Kevin Russell
observed in his article in American Atheist (&quot;A State religion: AA and
NA&quot; 2003) &quot;If democracy is a casualty, they won't know it.&quot; SAD BUT TRUE!

<p>

And of course, once I began announcing at meeting level, &quot;AA &#8212; you
people! &#8212; have turned me into an atheist.&quot; the anger of the &quot;alphas&quot;
became even more palpable and threatening. (And keep in mind: I am
writing this from liberal northern California!).

<p>

I have nothing to do with most of those former close friends &#8212; I don't
&quot;want what they have!&quot; &#8212; and with only 3  exceptions I have NEVER seen
ANY of these pious fools at peace vigils or peace demonstrations. In
fact, they are made highly uncomfortable by even the mention of war.
(Its as if, to admit the war's very existence would refute  the
existence of their absurd Micro-Managing God &#8212; as well it logically
should!!!) One close friend &#8212; whom I've known since way before
12step! &#8212; once remarked defensively concerning my stance on the war (and
we weren't even in a meeting at the time!) that: &quot;We have no opinions on
outside issues!&quot; What she really mean't was &quot;We have no opinions.&quot; Or,
more to the point: &quot;We have no Outside!&quot; (By the way, I loved what you
said under
&quot;<a href="orange-random.html#outside_issues" target="_blank">Random Thoughts</a>&quot;!
Its true. The women check whats left of their spines
at the door and I refer
to most of the men who aren't bellicose alphas... as AA GELDINGS.)

<p>
By the way its interesting to note that some of the most revered
&quot;patriarchs&quot; in my neck
of AA have interesting &quot;backgrounds&quot; and affiliations. Whether they're
bible toting, born again evangelicals, members of <i>The Activity</i> (another
cult!) &#8212; or sporting  criminal records of spousal abuse and/or
pedophilia. I've never seen anyone shut these men up, or attempt to &#8212;
which is odd, because they all try to stop me from talking or sticking
up for myself. No, gurus like that (both the bellicose biker types and
the pseudo-serene ghandi types) amass followers within AA and even get
standing ovations when they speak. The common thread, with some, seems
to be their ability to wear a persona of emotion-less serenity. Lack of
emotion being a trait AA'ers are taught to admire without question.  I
have watched men fawn in admiration over the COLD remote member  who
brags he did not &quot;have to&quot; cry at his own child's funeral!! It's
CHILLING what gets admired and touted as &quot;spiritual&quot; in the rooms of
AA!  I have seen and heard it all.

<p>
PS: This email would be another two pages if I commented on the Sexual
Predatory aspect of AA and the harm that's done that I've seen, but
others on your website have covered that nicely.  I would however like
to point out that: in keeping with the country its founded in, isn't it
&quot;funny&quot; that AAer's are often called on to do a separate &quot;sexual
inventory&quot; &#8212; as if that is the HEIGHT of  importance and needs additional
examination beyond the ordinary? &#8212; but not a separate &quot;violence
inventory&quot;? (Considering we're in a country that would rather look at a
president's sex life as opposed to where he's waging war... I guess that
would figure, huh? sigh. Again, the religious overtones of &quot;sex equals sin&quot;.)

<p>
At this point in time I keep most of these thoughts to myself as I &quot;edge
along the wall and make my way towards the EXIT sign.&quot; I have one
&quot;secular format&quot; AA meeting in my county (believe it or not, we have one
and it's Central office &quot;approved&quot;) I still attend at this time, but I
have no sponsor, I do no more &quot;service&quot; or attendance in other rooms,
mouth no prayers and I am slowly burning all my twelve step material (I
can't give it away, its too corrupting, I'd feel guilty!)  I keep only
the 6 Steps of S.O.S. (changed to the first person, since there are no
meetings in my area) on my refrigerator door. Let's face it, I've been
sober by my own hard work this whole time, anyway. God didn't do it, I did.

<p>
Once I leave this area &#8212; and I am planning to move, eventually &#8212; I will
leave AA behind as well, for good, all of it. I acknowledge I have met
SOME genuinely kind well-meaning souls in AA's rooms... However, for the
most part: It is a disturbed cult and on the whole: full of disturbed
narcissistic, spiritually-stunted CREEPY people that I wish no further
connection with! (Living among them is tantamount to being Darryl
Hannah's character in &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot;! And frankly, I'm guessing
that cavemen probably had a broader, healthier worldview!) PS: I
completely understand why people bury their affiliation with AA. Its not
really embarrassment so much as it is: like being in &quot;full flight&quot; from
a cult! Because it doesn't even pay to admit you are a former
member &#8212; even if you wanted to acknowledge out of courtesy that you
received some help from this direction. Because, alas, only full
lifelong allegiance is acceptable to them! Anything less is a blasphemy
in AA's eyes! Any  member you run into will view you with suspicion and
condemn you as &quot;dry&quot; instead of &quot;sober&quot; once they discover you have
pulled away from the fold &#8212; as if they have the right to re-define
Webster's definition! Such arrogance. (And frankly I'm tired of these
idiots walking up into my face and talking to me slowly as if *I* were
the insane one! In the 12Step Asylum the inmates are jangling the keys,
no question!)

<p>
Again,  thank you for this website! Keep on getting  the word out, keep
up the good work! It has helped me get through a difficult and painful
&quot;awakening&quot;.  Thanks too, for having Kasl's book on your Top Ten list!
Her book is also getting me through this transition period, she's
amazing. Love what a lot of other former AA'ers have said on your site.
(As for the naysayers: they're still brainwashed, here's they wake up!)
Nice to know I'm in good company.

Hi,

Just stumbled on your web page.  I thought it was extraordinary.

<p>

I'm an atheist in AA (with 15 yrs. sobriety) and have always hated the
'God stuff.'  I really think you put it all quite well.  Obviously well
researched too.

Thanks a lot?

To Mr or Mrs A.Orange,
<p>
enjoyed your pages on Bill Wilson &quot;Our&quot; Beloved
Founder &amp; Saviour, I like one of &quot;his&quot; quotes from the 12x12 book, don't
take life to seriously, its the classic story of human nature, don't do
as i do, but do as i say (a bit of a control freak), AA has helped many
human beings, but as in Life where there is a positive, there is also a
negative, I think AA is a CULT, and Cults the World Over have 2 things
In Common,
they Rule With FEAR &amp; CONTROL........
<p>
Life Is For Living &amp; Enjoying, It's Too Short........

Hi Alan,
<p>
Yes, I agree. Wouldn't it be nice if that &quot;Don't take life so
seriously&quot; remark was read out loud at the start
of every meeting, instead of that stuff about &quot;NEVER have we seen
a person fail... constitutionally incapable of being honest...&quot;
<p>
And in the interests of not being too serious, let's all go read

Date:  	Wed, October 12, 2005<br>
Subject:  	AA

<p>
If AA doesn't work, what does?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Carl,
<p>
The answer is so simple that lots of people miss it:
<p>
If you want to quit drinking, then quit drinking.
<p>
Just quit drinking.
<p>
Just don't put any more alcohol in your mouth.
<p>
Just stop drinking alcohol.
<p>
You don't need any program or organization for that.
Quitting drinking basically happens in about 5 seconds.
That's about how long it takes to really make the big decision.
<p>
For me the magic moment was when a friend took me out for pizza. I had already sort of decided to quit drinking,
had resigned myself to quitting, knew that I had to quit. My doctor had told me, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
And I knew that he wasn't joking.
I had also ended up homeless. I was just so sick that I couldn't work, so I got way behind on the bills and got
evicted. Cloudy as my mind was, I could see that things weren't working out right. So I decided to quit drinking.
<p>
Out on the streets, I
had tapered off and pretty much drank nothing for the previous week, but had taken a few sips when people
offered me hits off of their drinks.
Then my status as a veteran got me a place in a homeless shelter and I
was slated to start an alcoholism treatment program in a few weeks.
Then a friend showed up and offered to take me out for pizza.
<p>
At the pizza parlor, I ordered pizza and a beer.
I sort of figured that just one wouldn't hurt, or some such thinking.
Then a little voice inside me said, &quot;If you are really going to do
this thing, if you are really going to quit, then let's not be fucking around.&quot;
I changed that order for a beer to a lemonaid. And that was it. 
That was 5 years ago, and I haven't had a drink since.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
[UPDATE: 2014.11.19: Now it's 14 years that I haven't had a drink, or a cigarette, or a hit of dope.
And it feels good.]
</font>

<p>
Now I suspect that what you are looking for is something that will help you to develop the resolve to quit drinking.
Perhaps you need something to help you to break out of old habits and strengthen your will power and clarify your
thinking.
That is a different issue.
I recommend two things for that: SMART and Rational Recovery.
<p>
SMART teaches mental techniques like Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy,
 which is really just a high-falutin way
of saying that you should practice weighing the benefits and costs of
 some course of action (like drinking or doping),
and also examining your beliefs and ripping out by the roots old irrational beliefs.
SMART meetings are good things. Going to a bunch of them can help.

<p>
You can also read these books:<br>
== <a href="orange-top10.html#Ellis" target="_blank"><i>When AA Doesn't Work for You,
 Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol</i></a>,
by Albert Ellis, Ph.D., and Emmett Velten, Ph.D.<br>
== <a href="orange-top10.html#Trimpey" target="_blank"><i>The Small Book</i></a>, by Jack Trimpey<br>
for more about rational thinking and rational recovery techniques.

<p>
Also check out the other 20 or 30 books on that &quot;Top 10&quot; list.
<p>
Rational Recover is no longer an organization or a meeting; it is a book.
The heart of it is the realization that we have a primitive old reptilian
 brain inside our heads
that is so stupid that it will never
stop believing that smoking, drinking and drugging are fun and feel great,
 just as good as food and sex.
And old lizard brain will never stop yammering about how we should just
 have a little one now.

Subject:  	Bill W

<p>
Hey Mr. Orange:

<p>
Why have you got such a hate on for Bill W.? Sure, he was an egoist and
belonged to a 50's paradigm or modality of thought. But surely the
program of AA has helped more people than it has harmed. And the spirit
if the Big Book, although it does have its moments of odd sounding logic
and ideology, is one of generosity, of wanting to help others. Whereas
the spirit of your papers seems to me to be one of vitriol and
passive-aggressive self-righteousness. I hate to say it, but I think you
have a RESENTMENT. Why, exactly? What's your story? Please tell me, what
were your intentions here? Are you yourself a recovered alcoholic? I
don't believe Bill was a Saint, but I do find his writings nonetheless
helpful in my own struggle to understand addictions and how to overcome
them. Would you recommend a different approach, another philosophy, a
better book perhaps?
<p>

Hi Robyn,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You asked, &quot;Why such 'hatred' for Bill W.?&quot;
<p>
I think it is a really low despicable crime to lie to sick people about what might cure them.
<p>
It is also the lowest of the low to use religion to deceive and manipulate people.
As Mahatma Ghandi said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I know of no greater sin than to oppress the innocent in the name of God.<br>
== Mahatma Gandhi, April 1947.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>All Men Are Brothers</i>, Mahatma Gandhi, page 73.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

You parrot the standard A.A. malarkey about &quot;having a resentment&quot;.
I really can't count how many times I've heard that, but I'll try.
Look
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters6.html#resentment" target="_blank">here</a> and
<li> <a href="orange-letters7.html#resentment" target="_blank">here</a> and
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#resentment" target="_blank">here</a> and
<li> <a href="orange-letters13.html#resentment" target="_blank">here</a> and

<li> <a href="orange-letters25.html#resentment" target="_blank">here</a> and
<li> <a href="orange-letters48.html#resentment" target="_blank">here</a>.
</ol>
I guess that might do for starters.

<p>
But just for fun, for giggles and grins, just for a different approach,
let's say that
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>*I do*</i> &quot;have a resentment&quot;,
a really big fat healthy monster of a resentment.
</font>

<p>
So what?
<p>
What then? What happens? Does the sky fall? Does my head explode? Do I instantly relapse?
<p>
That can't be true, because I have 5 years of sobriety now, and my resentment against Bill Wilson has grown
stronger, not weaker, over the years, as I have read more and more of his books and learned more of the real truth about him,
and learned more of the real truth about Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Then you asked,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Why, exactly? What's your story? Please tell me, what
were your intentions here? Are you yourself a recovered alcoholic?&quot;
</font>

<p>
Obviously, you haven't read a lot of my pages if you don't know whether I'm a recovered alcoholic.
Start with
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction, my introduction to A.A.</a>, and also
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program" target="_blank">the &quot;treatment&quot;
bait-and-switch trick</a>,
and
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing" target="_blank">another friend goes missing</a>.
</ul>
<p>
You asked, &quot;Why?&quot; I've answered that question so many times that I'll just point you to the answers
<a href="orange-letters3.html#agenda" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters10.html#agenda" target="_blank">here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters25.html#agenda2" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Just a few minutes ago, I answered the question about what else might help, so I'll point you to that answer
<a href="orange-letters26.html#what_works" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	Re: Bill W

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
Here is just one of your innumerable failures at a fair treatment of
your subject (occurring one after the other on every page):

<p>
&quot;Then Step Twelve tells you to go recruiting, to draft more alcoholics
into this madness.&quot;

<p>
Wrong. If you've been around AA even a few weeks you'll surely hear one
of the AA sayings, repeated ad nauseum: &quot;Attraction rather than
promotion.&quot; Or the responsibility pledge: &quot;When anyone anywhere, reaches
out for help, I want the hand of AA always to be there. And for that I
am responsible.&quot; In other words, there is no recruiting in AA. In fact,
the opposite approach is practiced.

<p>
Your ignorance on this point alone disqualifies you from making any
judgments regarding AA that are of any value. It is obvious you are
coming from an extremely biased point of view, and that you are not a
scholar, although you poorly pretend to be.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Robyn,
<p>
I am not ignorant on that point. I know all of the facts, which you seem
to be pointedly ignoring.
<p>
When A.A. declares that it is a program of attraction, not promotion, that
is just a hypocritical lie. A.A. has always been a program of coercion and promotion, not attraction.
Alcoholics Anonymous has been practicing coercive recruiting since
Day One. The book <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i> describes how Dr. Bob
and Bill Wilson shoved their
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Oxford Group cult religion</a>
&quot;treatment&quot; on A.A. Number Three, Bill Dotson, when he was in
the hospital:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
... they thought it a good idea to have a preliminary talk with his wife.
And this became part of the way things were done in the early days: Discuss
it first with the wife; find out what you could; then plan your approach.
It should be noted, as well, that the alcoholic himself didn't ask for help.
He didn't have anything to say about it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 1980, pages 82-83.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob actually felt entitled to shove their own
cult religion on other alcoholics regardless of the patient's wishes or
beliefs &#8212; &quot;for his own good&quot; &#8212; the patient didn't get any
say in the matter. (That is still the attitude of many so-called counselors
and therapists today.)
<p>
By the way, The book <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i> is official
&quot;council-approved&quot; A.A. history.
<p>
And nothing has changed in the following 65 years.
In the November 2002 issue of Grapevine, A.A. pundits summarized the
results from the most recent official A.A. Triennial Survey.
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">
It revealed that 61% of the current A.A. membership was coerced</a>,
pressured, or shoved into A.A. by the criminal justice system or
health care systems, or employee diversion programs, or co-workers, or family.
 That is not a program of attraction.
<p>
Furthermore, &quot;if you've been around AA even a few weeks&quot; (to use your phrase),
then you have undoubtedly seen people handing in those slips of paper to get signatures for
the court or some program or other. Those people are forced to be at those meetings,
OR ELSE. That is coercion and promotion, not attraction. And you know that. You can't NOT know it.
You have eyes that work. You can see what is going on.
So you are in denial of what is in front of your face.
<p>
Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.

<p>
Read these two items for the rest of the details about A.A. recruiting:<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">24. Aggressive Recruiting.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">25. Deceptive Recruiting.</a>
</ul>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
P.S.: I forgot to even mention that all of chapter 7 of the <i>Big Book</i> is the recruiting manual.
Look here for a discussion of that:
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">Recruiting Mind Games</a>.
</font>
</font>
<p>
<a name="resentment2"> </a>

From The Orange papers I only see how unabashedly prejudiced you are in
your views against AA. The statistics you site are unreliable to say the
least and of course statistics in studies like these mean little to
nothing. Your ''arguments' are skewed in a manner akin to bad sophomoric
rhetoric. This is not a rigorous criticism of AA, this is a blatant rant
of a small intellect and a big resentment. I could pick your 'papers'
apart as easily as plucking the wings off of a dead fly, but I'm not so
sadistic as that, nor do I have the time.

<p>

Again, I ask you, why have you put so much effort into such
nay-saying speechifying? You seem like a very damaged person who is
pointing the finger at AA &#8212; admittedly, not a perfect organization,
which yes, does have some of the /superficial /trappings of a cult &#8212; as
the cause of your damage. But hey, if you actually did the steps
thoroughly yourself then you might begin to look at the true culprit,
which is you. Don't be afraid. You can do it! Really, physician, heal
thy self.

<p>
Love Robyn

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well Robyn, the reason that I put so much effort into it is because somebody
has to tell the truth to counter the river of lies that comes out of the A.A.
propaganda machine to promote 12-Step quack medicine. You  should ask why
so many people expend
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">so much effort to promote a program</a>
that has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">a zero-percent success rate</a>,
above normal spontaneous remission.  (Besides to make money...)
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	much thanks...

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>
I have been frequenting your web site for over a year now. I feel it's about
time to write and let you know how important the information contained on
your site is. You certainly have done a lot of research. Your site has
confirmed a lot of the things I have witnessed and encountered the last
several years. I will sometimes have to stop reading an article because my
emotions get the best of me. I would consider myself a victim of the 12 step
industry but we both know it does me no good now.  The important thing is
that I have finally gotten out of the 12 step &quot;mentality&quot; and am beginning
to know peace. It's ironic and sad that the people/institutions I turned to
made things worse.  I am now recovering from an addiction and the abuses
doled out by a dysfunctional religious cult. I know... as if there was any
other type of cult. Like you I hope to use my anger (outrage) to help others
so they don't have to experience what I went through.  I believe that I
belong to the category of alcoholics that don't get sober through 12 step
indoctrination and don't have the sense to get off the merry-go-round in
time. I know there are others... some of them people I care about. It's sad
to see them go in and out of the &quot;hallowed&quot; rooms of AA and endure the
disillusionment, lies, deceit, condescension... all of the bullshit. It's
so cruel.
<p>
Anyway, I remember when your site was out of order for a period. I was
devastated to say the least. Your hard work and diligence has resulted in a
&quot;one stop&quot; source of information. I feel I should at least ask if I can help
in some way...
<a href="orange-wishlist.html#donations" target="_blank">maybe a donation or something</a>.
It's very important to me that
you remain online.  As a health care provider I have also been mandated to
rehab and 12 step attendance. I hope to avoid any type of &quot; treatment&quot; in
the future. Of course staying sober will undoubtably help. I'm still
concerned about being in &quot;compliance&quot; and forced into attending meetings or
lying about it.  It's truly an absurd situation.  The addiction
industry/recovery group movement (per Jack Trimpey) is in my experience a
juggernaut of sorts.  There is just too much money/job security  at stake
for people in the field to do anything but the status quo.  It is as one
author wrote a &quot;great American tragedy&quot;. More of a travesty really.
<p>
Ok well keep up the good work. I hope to begin writing (journaling) some of
my experiences, observations and feelings. Who knows, it may someday make a
good book. I also wanted to say that it's funny to read some of the &quot;hate
mail&quot; that you receive. It doesn't surprise me that most of it is written by
morons who can never argue a point or engage in any type of intelligent
/logical discussion or debate.  Thanks again.

<p>

Sincerely,<br>
Chris

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wow, Chris, thanks for all of the complements. That kind of stuff really brightens my day,
and makes me feel like I might be on the right track after all.
<p>
You have a good day too.

Subject:  	Battling the validity of Alcoholics Anonymous

<p>
Hi there,

<p>
My name is Alan S. and I need some information
from you about alcoholics anonymous. I really don't
have all the time in the world at this very moment,
but I am in the middle of a long term debate which is
starting to look as if it may get a bit nasty. The
debate is with my ex-drug and alcohol counselors who
insist that AA works, and more ridiculous than that,
insist that AA works substantially better than
non-treatment.

<p>
The arguement started to get nasty on one
counselors part when I was told more than once that I
was talking out of my ass. I brought in all 115 pages
of your webpage bound together as proof to my claims,
but this was, of course, not enough. So, what I am in
search of are statistics which can be traced. I need
to find statistics on the recovery of individuals
without treatment programs, and also through the use
of Rational Recovery, SMART etc. They are under the
impression that although I hold documented research
and statistics in my hands I can not judge the
validity of AA's claims without having participated in
the program myself. That &quot;if you have not eaten
spinach how can you say that spinach is gross?&quot; We
both know, and I told him, that such logic is, well,
illogical. I was told that &quot;we deal with intangibles
here.&quot; It got absurd. I was laughed at, literally
laughed at, by this counselor who sounds nothing short
of a hyenna when I called what they're doing to people
sad and ridiculous.

<p>
If you have a phone number where I could reach you
then I would gladly pay the cost of the call. Speaking
as the closest person to a pacifist who I know
personally, I find it somewhat regrettable to say that
I felt a great urge to slap these men upside their
heads with your essay towards the end of the
conversation.

<p>
My name is Alan S. and my phone number is
xxx-xxx-xxxx

<p>
I live on the west coast and I am home only in the
evenings any given day of the week.

<p>
This means a lot to me especially considering that I
was told upon asking if I could come in and tell each
meeting that they were not required to attend
Alcoholics Anonymous that &quot;fine you can do that, but
when these people die of alcoholism then their deaths
are on your head.&quot; I was once again told that I was
speaking from ignorance as well as out of my ass.
There is one other counselor who is, although no more
logical or rational, a bit more reasonable to speak
with.

<p>
I am, of course, speaking of the counselor addicted
to cigarettes and not coffee.

<p>
I can jokingly say that it was fate and an act of
divine intervention which brought me to your website!

<p>
Never could it have been by my own doing!

<p>
Nothing could ever be!

<p>
Thanks again, Alan S.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Alan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Boy do I have something to say.
<p>
First off, those counselors who are promoting the 12-Step program are pulling the
propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#shift_burden" target="_blank">Shift the Burden of Proof Onto Your Opponent</a>.
They are insisting that you prove that A.A. doesn't work.<br>
Wrong.<br>
That is not your job.<br>
They are the ones who are making outrageous claims of efficacy for cult religion quack medicine,
so it is their job to prove that A.A. *does* work.<br>
<p>
And of course no evidence of the inefficacy of 12-Step treatment that
you supply to those counselors will satisfy them.
They would have no jobs if they admitted that their
big cure was just selling ineffective cult religion to the suckers.<br>
<p>
<a name="Randomized_Longitudinal"> </a>
There is no valid proof that A.A. works, or that treatment programs based on A.A. work.<br>
None whatsoever.<br>
I have been sincerely looking for five years, and it isn't there.<br>
I have also had a challenge out there,
challenging the A.A.-boosters to come up with just one valid
<a href="orange-letters7.html#controlled_study" target="_blank"><i><b>Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Study</b></i></a>
that proved the efficacy of 12-Step treatment. I have received a few references to
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="_blank">faked studies</a>, but nothing even half-ways valid.
Nothing in 5 years. (The true-believer Steppers have called me every name in the book for 5 years,
but they have never bothered to send a single report of a medically valid
test that made A.A. look good. Not one.)


<p>
<a name="RLCS"> </a>
What you must demand &#8212; constantly demand, and don't back down on this point &#8212; is:<br>
<center>
<font size="+2">
<i><b>Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</b></i>.
</font>
</center>
<p>
What that means is:
<ol>
<p>
<li> &quot;<b><i>Controlled</i></b>&quot; means that there is a control group.
That is, a group that gets no treatment or help of
any kind. So you are really testing two similar groups of people.
Ideally, the <i>*only*</i> difference
between the two groups is that one gets the treatment (A.A. and the 12 Steps), and the other group
gets nothing.
<p>
<li> The patients or clients must be selected to go into the treatment group or the control group <b><i>randomly</i></b>.
Throw dice or pick names out of a hat.  No cherry-picking is allowed,
where all of the most promising patients go into the A.A.-treated group.<br>
(I know about that stunt &#8212; I was chosen for treatment on the basis
of having quit drinking once before, all on my own, and having stayed
sober for 3 years, all on my own. They felt that made me a good candidate
for their A.A.-based treatment program to teach me how to stay sober
for 6 months. And can you believe that they count me as one of their
rare success stories in their phony claims of success?)
<p>
<li> <b>&quot;Longitudinal&quot;</b> means that the test goes on for a long time. (Like
preferably for at least a year, or even 5 or 8 years.)
Just counting the &quot;success stories&quot; the day of &quot;graduation&quot;
from the program is as phony as a 3-dollar bill. Many, many people relapse in the
month following treatment. Treatment doesn't last. It doesn't have any holding power.

<p>
<li> Also, no cherry-picking of the results is allowed. The proponents of A.A. treatment
cannot rationalize away the failures by
saying that &quot;they didn't try hard enough&quot;, or &quot;they didn't
really want to quit&quot;, or &quot;they didn't work the steps right&quot;, or
&quot;they didn't keep coming back&quot;.<br>
<i><b>ALL</b></i> of the patients count, without exception.<br>
(Many treatment programs only report their &quot;graduates&quot; and
talk about how great they are doing.
But only the sober ones &quot;graduate&quot;, so they are cherry-picking
the winners, and only talking about their success stories.)
<br>
They must count all of the clients who were assigned to their group.
No excuses. (When doctors are testing medicines, they don't accept the
excuse that the medicine didn't work because the patient didn't pray right.)

<p>
<li> At the end of that long time, you add up the scores, and see how
many alcoholics got and stayed sober, and how many died,
and how many are still drinking.<br>
You might also ask about moderate drinking &#8212; how many have transitioned into
just having a few once in a while, without getting into trouble over it?<br>
You might also want to ask how many got repeatedly rearrested for public drunkenness,
and how many are doing worse binge drinking than before.<br>
You could also ask about imprisonment, suicides, employment status, mental health, and
<a href="orange-letters14.html#study_questions" target="_blank">many other such things</a>.

<p>
<li> Then you compare the results from the two groups to see what A.A.
and the 12 Steps really did for the alcoholics.
</ol>

<p>
Have such tests ever been done? Oh yes, for sure, yes. And the results
were that A.A. was a total failure.
In some cases it was *far worse* than getting no help or treatment of any kind.

<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman</a> found
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for public drunkenness
in a group of street drunks.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh</a> found that
A.A. just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
made them require more expensive hospitalization later on.

<li>
In England, a British team of researchers,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a>, <i>et. al.</i>,
found that just having a doctor speak to alcoholics for a single hour, telling them to quit
drinking or they were going to die, was just as effective as a whole
year of A.A.-based &quot;treatment&quot;.

<li>
The most damning test of all was done by one of the leaders of A.A., Doctor and Professor
George E. Vaillant, who is also just about
the biggest A.A. booster in the world.
He just loves A.A. and thinks that everybody should get shoved into it.

Doctor George E. Vaillant is also a Professor of Psychology
at Harvard University, and he is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc..
Vaillant clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based treatment program had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Vaillant also candidly admitted that the A.A.-based treatment program had a zero-percent success rate.
At the end of 8 years, his results with his first 100 patients were:
5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking. But 5% is also the normal rate of spontaneous remission
in alcoholics. That's how many quit drinking each year without any treatment.
So 5 minus 5 yields zero, the real A.A. success rate.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
So while they are so quick to accuse you of killing alcoholics by depriving
the clients of the A.A. magic,
they are stubbornly ignoring the report from
an A.A. leader who declared that the death rate of the A.A. program was &quot;appalling&quot;.
That kind of hypocrisy is just so typical of a cult.
</font>

</ol>
All of those studies can be traced back to their source. The links to those studies will give you the
original publications.


<p>
That brings up another question to ask those counselors: <i>&quot;What is the normal rate of spontaneous
remission in alcoholics?&quot;</i>

<p>
If they say zero, they are lying, and trying to claim all of the cases of spontaneous remission as their
own success stories.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">The most realistic answer is about 5% per year</a>.
Also look at
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg" target="_blank">what Dr. Sheldon Zimberg wrote about spontaneous remission</a>.
<p>
That spontaneous remission number creates big problems for those counselors, because it reveals
that all they are doing is taking credit for those people who were going to quit anyway, or who
did just quit a week or two before starting treatment. (Like I did.)

<p>
You said that you printed the web site, and it was 115 pages.
I suspect that you must be looking at a very
old version of the web site, somewhere.
When I last printed it out, about 4 years ago, it was about that size, and it
has gotten *much* larger. (So large that I wouldn't consider printing it on paper again.
I tell people to burn CDs from
<a href="menu1.html#archives" target="_blank">the archive files</a>.)
<p>
Make sure that you are looking at www.orange-papers.org, and especially look at
the web page on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</a>.
You will find references to all of the valid studies of the efficacy of 12-step treatment
that I've been able to find in the last 5 years. And there isn't a single test that shows that
A.A. is anything like a successful treatment program. Every single time that A.A. was put to the test, it failed.

<p>
If you hear of talk about other kinds of studies than
Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies, be <i>very</i> wary. They are usually invalid and faked.
One of the most outrageous terms is &quot;anecdotal study&quot;. That is what the <i>Big Book</i> is.
An anecdotal study means that somebody just collects a bunch of stories that say what he wants the
audience to hear:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Step right up. This wonderful snake oil cures whatever ails you. Why Joe Blow
here was sick as a dog and talking about what he wanted on his headstone,
until he drank 5 bottles of Dr. Phineas T. Farnsworth's Magic Snake Oil Elixir
and now he's up and chasing the pretty girls around the block. Hurry! Hurry! Get it while it lasts!&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
A &quot;survey of the professional literature&quot; is another faked study.
That means that they collect pro-A.A. articles written
by other A.A. boosters and conclude that everybody agrees that A.A. works great.
(That's the propaganda trick of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank">Everybody Knows</a>,
as in &quot;Everybody knows that the world is flat. There is no question about it.&quot;)

<p>
Also watch out for phony &quot;studies&quot; that find that the treatment program's &quot;graduates&quot; are much more
sober than some other group of alcoholics. That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#apples_to_oranges" target="_blank">comparing apples to oranges</a>, and it is also pulling a switcheroo.

As mentioned above, the &quot;graduates&quot; are a cherry-picked minority of the people who started the program.
The real question to ask is, &quot;How many of the incoming clients actually 'graduate'?&quot;
Usually the answer is only about 10%. If you compare <i>ALL</i> of the patients who start the program to a similar
group of alcoholics who didn't get the treatment, then you see that the program isn't all that good.

<p>
And then there is the big question of how long the improvement lasts.
They usually get a temporary improvement, just a little boost caused by encouragement in the treatment
program, but it wears off quickly and most of the graduates relapse.
Treatment centers seem to usually get about a 10% success rate, but it gradually drops to
5% as the graduates relapse. 5% is just the normal rate of spontaneous remission, which
leaves the treatment centers with a real success rate of zero percent.
That's why the treatment centers really don't want to do long-term studies
and see how many graduates are still sober 1, 3, or 5 years later.

<p>
<a name="only1left"> </a>
I recently ran into a counselor from the housing I was in during my treatment,
and she told me that, after 4 years, I was <b><i>*the only one*</i></b>
who still had not relapsed, out of more than 100 people going through the program then.
And I'm the one who actually quit drinking two weeks before the program started.
<p>
That brings up another item: motivation.
The people who are seeking treatment are a very different population
from the other alcoholics who don't want to quit drinking.
Comparing a bunch of willing patients who want to quit drinking to a bunch
of hard-core, committed street drunks will always make the treatment
program look good.
But the treatment program isn't actually doing anything beneficial there.
The differences between the two groups have nothing whatsoever to do with the treatment program.


<p>
Somebody did a study that I would like to find where they not only studied a treatment program's patients, they also
studied another group of people who wanted to get into the treatment program but who could not, for one reason
or another. Perhaps they didn't have the money, or their health insurance wouldn't cover it, or something.
Nevertheless, later, like at the 1-year point, those who got the treatment and those who only wanted to get it
were equally sober. Those people who wanted treatment but who couldn't get it just went out and quit drinking anyway,
all by themselves, without any treatment.
Obviously, what is really being measured in a lot of invalid studies is the motivation of the patients, not
the efficacy of the treatment program.


<p>
Another false comparison to watch out for is <i>Upscale/Downscale</i>
comparisons.
Some expensive clinic that charges $10,000 or $15,000 (in advance) for
a 28-day-long A.A. meeting will compare their graduates to
&quot;alcoholics in general&quot;, and find that their graduates are
much more successful in staying sober. Yeh, and their patients are also
much more successful in scrounging up 15,000 dollars than the street
drunks are.
<p>
Rich people usually fare better because they haven't lost everything
like the real down-and-out alcoholics have. Somebody did another study
that found that the upscale people always did better, because they still
had a lot to lose. They were highly motived to get their act together
and keep from losing it all. The street drunks had little left to lose,
other than their lives (which they tended to feel weren't worth much).


<p>
<a name="Joe_who"> </a>
Also watch out for programs that cherry-pick the patients going into
the program.
There is a drug treatment program in this town that recruits at the
local city detox center, and only picks those addicts whom they feel
sure won't relapse (and pull down their averages).
That program won't even take their own graduates who have relapsed.
And they have a bad habit of erasing failures from the books.
(&quot;Joe? Joe who? Joe didn't relapse.  He was never in our program
in the first place.&quot;)
That is classic Enron-style accounting, which is something that some
treatment programs are also good at.
<p>
After all of that, the treatment program proudly proclaims that their
clients commit a whole lot fewer crimes than the other addicts who are
out stealing to get a fix.
The &quot;counselors&quot; carefully cherry-pick those people who will
commit fewer crimes, and then they claim that they have reduced the
crime rate of their clients, and they proudly crow &quot;Treatment works!&quot;
<p>
And they take city, state, and federal tax dollars to run that scam.
A lot of this so-called &quot;treatment industry&quot; is little more
than organized crime.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	question for you

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
I would not write this, but I keep coming across your work every time I
look up anything pertaining to AA.

<p>
I try hard to keep an open mind when it doesn't come naturally.  I admit
your papers contain many valid points, but I am curious as to why you
have put forth so much effort to undermine the efforts of this group. I
know hypocrites both in and out of AA &#8212; sure &#8212; it bothers me when
someone is at the podium and I know they are not a good example of AA
principles at work. I've even been screwed over by someone as such and
have to know they are speaking at conferences &#8212; hard for anyone to deal
with. But I've come to some conclusions:

<p>
I look at my own spiritual growth and without going into too much
detail, see that even the worst examples in AA have brought some of my
greatest spiritual lessons. And I have had the pleasure and the pain of
being a bad example myself. In other words, there is a greater picture
at work and sometimes it is the Angel in Devil's clothing (or visa
versa) that simply delivered the message. That is what I benefit from
paying attention to &#8212; not the messenger.

<p>
So why dissect the messengers???

<p>
I would hold the facts and opinions you weave up to a far better light
were they not drenched in scorn and bias oozing and seething through
every exposed thread. In other words I actually enjoy reading some of
your work but get really turned off by what appears to me to be ulterior
motives based on grudges.

<p>
Why?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Injoyon,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You are mixing apples and oranges.
I am talking about the total failure of A.A. as a treatment program
for alcoholics, and you are talking about how spiritual it makes you feel.
Those two things have little or nothing to do with each other.
<p>

Is A.A. supposed to be a quit-drinking program, or is it a religion?
<p>
It seems to be more of a religion for you, because I notice that you did not
mention alcohol, sobriety, or quitting drinking even once.
It's all about &quot;spirituality&quot;.

<p>
I think that it is horribly unspiritual to lie to sick people and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">tell them that A.A. works great</a>
when it doesn't.
Do you think that is &quot;spiritual&quot;?

<p>
I think that it is horribly unspiritual to
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceive sick people to get them to join
Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
What do you think about that?

<p>
And I don't think it is very spiritual to promote a religion that is as bizarre and
heretical as Alcoholics Anonymous. Have you read the file on
<i><a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a></i>?
What do you think about that?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

[2nd letter from Injoyon:]
<p>

Date:  	Fri, October 14, 2005<br>
Subject:  	PS

<p>
I have had personal experience with Narcissistic Personality Disorder &#8212;
It's not something you should throw around lightly.  These people are
shells of people &#8212; they are incapable of admitting any fault. To
actually look at their part would cause a puncture to their NP that is
too great to withstand. They would never see a specialist or
psychologist. (FYI &#8212; the NPD I know stands at the podium of AA &#8212; it
drives me crazy. I've concluded he is not at fault &#8212; he seems to have
been born that way &#8212; he is genuinely wired differently &#8212; it is all he
knows &#8212; it is his very nature.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Injoyon.
<p>
I do not throw that NPD term around lightly. In fact, I did not even use it for
the first few years that I was writing about Bill Wilson. I spoke more about
delusions of grandeur. I only gradually transitioned over to concluding that
NPD was a very good diagnosis of Bill's behavior after reading a good many books
about both Bill and NPD.
</font>
<p>
<a name="battle_trustees"> </a>
Do you know that when Bill officially handed over the fellowship his
depression lifted? Do you suppose it was an overwhelming burden he
carried for reasons unknown to even him? (Like can you imagine it could
be possible that even for Bill, there WAS a power bigger than him at work??)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I know that Bill officially handed over the leadership, and I also know that
he didn't mean to do it. Bill wanted to appear to be noble and selfless, and
he was under the misimpression that the Board of Trustees
would just rubber-stamp his dictates. But they didn't.
<p>
When Bill wanted A.A.W.S. to pay his mistress Helen Wynn out of his royalty income,
they concluded that it would be very unwise to mix Bill's sexual affairs with the
finances of the Alcoholic Foundation, and told Bill to pay his mistresses himself.
Bill was furious at their effrontery.
<p>
After the Trustees voted against Bill on another issue, Bill wrote a sarcastic self-pitying
letter to the Board of Trustees, saying that he hoped that they would still see fit
to allow him to have an office in the A.A. headquarters.
<p>
Nan Robertson wrote that Bill Wilson would vacation in Vermont, and then,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Bill returned home from these trips refreshed, ready to do battle again
with the trustees.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Nan Robertson, page 57.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The original group of alcoholics had sought out the best and wisest men
that they could find to be the Trustees of the Alcoholic Foundation, but
all that Bill Wilson could do was constantly &quot;do battle&quot; with them
and fight to get his own way about everything.

<p>
In the end, Bill Wilson simply tired of the combat and moved out to the country and spent
most of his time at his home <i>Stepping Stones</i>. He didn't go to A.A. meetings and he
had very little to do with A.A. any more, other than cashing the royalty checks.
Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary,
wrote that the other A.A. members were having a hard time accepting the fact that the
founder of A.A. was not actually <i>in</i> A.A. any more.

<p>
You stated that,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They [NPD cases] would never see a specialist or psychologist.&quot;<br>
</font>
It looks like you are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#generalize" target="_blank">over-generalizing from just one case</a>,
the guy you knew.
What the doctors and psychiatrists say is that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are
prone to suffering from terrible depression, and yes, they will seek medical aid on occasion.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Even when he [a <i>Narcissistic Legend in His Own Mind</i>] goes through periods
of depression, during which he talks about what a terrible person he is, what [he]
is looking for is not advice on how to do things better, but someone to reassure
him of what he knows in his heart &#8212; that he's just fine the way he is.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Emotional Vampires: Dealing with People Who Drain You Dry</i>,
Albert J. Bernstein, Ph.D., pages 141-142.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The psychiatrist Dr. Alexander Lowen described the behavior of a narcissistic patient named Erich:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another aspect of narcissism that was evident in Erich's personality was his
need to project an image. He presented himself as someone committed to &quot;doing
good for others,&quot; to use his words.
But this image was a perversion of reality. What he called &quot;doing good for
others&quot; represented an exercise of power over them, which,
despite his stated good intentions, verged on the diabolical.
Under the guise of doing good, for instance, Erich exploited his girlfriend:
He got her to love him without any loving response on his part. Such
exploitativeness is common to all narcissistic personalities.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i>, Alexander Lowen, M.D.,
page 5.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill Wilson's own psychiatrist,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Tiebout_diagnosis" target="_blank">Dr. Tiebout,
criticized Bill Wilson</a> by saying that he had been trying to live
out the infantilely grandiose demands of &quot;His Majesty the Baby&quot;.
<p>
That sounds very close to infantile narcissism.
</font>

<p>
<a name="context"> </a>
I think you take many things out of context. Why so much effort to
biasly expose detail after detail in order to back your personal
opinions/motives??

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I do not take things out of context. I am very careful not to change or distort the meaning
of things that I quote. We have been over this before.
<a href="orange-letters12.html#context" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>

<p>
Why not remain objective &#8212; your points would be far better met then.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I try very hard to be objective, like when I insist on Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies
to support claims of success in treating alcoholics. And everybody, including A.A., Rational Recovery, SMART, and
any other treatment program must meet the same strict standards of proof before they claim success.
And
<a href="orange-letters12.html#SMART_success_rate" target="_blank">
I don't even credit SMART with anything more than a two percent success rate</a>, above normal spontaneous
remission (which is 5%, so SMART gets a total success rate of maybe 7%).
That is being objective.
<p>
Perhaps you meant something other than &quot;objective&quot;. Perhaps you meant non-critical or unemotional,
like that I am not supposed to feel contempt for people who calmly lie to sick people about what
will cure them.
If you are looking for that kind of emotional deadness, well, you won't find it here.
<p>
Have a good day anyway.

<font color="blue">
Hello Injoyon, 
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You are mixing apples and oranges. I am talking about the total failure of A.A. as a treatment program for alcoholics, and you are talking about how spiritual it makes you feel. Those two things have little or nothing to do with each other. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
You misunderstand me. I am talking about how time and
again your rationale is contaminated with your bias, overshadowing and
undermining your own work and secondly wondering why the (personal)
grudge?
To illustrate I could debate any number of most points you try to make
in your essays, but I will use an example from your opening paragraph
right here.<br>
<font color="blue">
&quot;I am talking about the total failure of A.A. as a treatment program for alcoholics.&quot;
</font>

<p>
True to form, you have again left the realm of logic and entered the
seething caldron of debate. Come on Agent Orange, anybody can prove just
about anything anymore. It's not rocket science. I can prove 1 = 2.
So what is your point? And better yet, why are you so driven to make it?

<p>
Time and again you try to appeal logically by sifting through the
cornucopia of scandalous tidbits riddled in personalities to corroborate
your own bias. Most of us are completely dumbfounded and left to wonder&quot;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
No, Injoyon, it is you who is leaving the realm of reason. You are trying to dismiss all logic
and reason as invalid just because valid medical tests showed Alcoholics Anonymous to be completely
ineffective and useless as a cure for alcoholism, and in fact downright harmful &#8212;
increasing the rate of binge drinking, and increasing the death rate.
<p>
The statement that &quot;anybody can prove just about anything anymore&quot; is completely untrue.
That is just an attempt to use the debating trick
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape via Relativism</a> &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just one guy's opinion versus another,
and anything could be true. We never know anything for sure.&quot;
</font>
Not so.
<p>
You can't just &quot;prove&quot; anything.
Can you prove that the world is flat? Can you prove that diseases are caused by evil witches
casting spells and putting hexes on people?
<p>
We do know some things for sure. The world is round, not flat. Bacteria and viruses cause diseases,
not the old lady down the street casting spells and hexes.
The moon is not made of green cheese. Alcoholics Anonymous does not have a good success rate
in curing alcoholism. And we know that &quot;1 = 2&quot; is bad mathematics. (I challenge you to prove
that &quot;1 = 2&quot;.)

<p>
When I talk about proof, I am talking about carefully controlled medical studies,
<a href="orange-letters26.html#Randomized_Longitudinal" target="_blank">
<i>Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</i></a>.
Such studies are carefully designed and conducted
in a controlled manner to eliminate errors, bias, and false conclusions.

<p>
When you talk about proof, you mean a bunch of lies and deceptions strung together with
a bunch of propaganda and debating tricks, like how politicians talk.
That isn't proof of anything.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
what the hell happened to you Orange? Who hurt you? I am not going to
debate with you what is success.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
Well that is really dodging the issues. That is about the single most important issue
in the whole argument about Alcoholics Anonymous, and you are going to run away from
the debate and refuse to discuss success?
<p>
You just admitted defeat.
<p>
You won't argue about the A.A. success rate because you really know what a huge failure A.A. really is.
Everything else is pretty irrelevant when A.A. has no better a success rate in sobering up alcoholics
than doing nothing.
</font>
</blockquote>

 As for &quot;total&quot;, well that includes a sum total, inclusive of
 its parts  &#8212;  ie) everyone. I fail to see how A.A. reached the far
 corners of the world were this true. &quot;Total failure&quot; appears
 nothing short of a descriptive based on erroneous opinion in attempts
 to further your own agenda. The very same thing you accuse 
Bill Wilson of over and over.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
It doesn't matter what you fail to see. That is not evidence.
A.A. reaches to the furthest corners of the globe just like how Scientology does.
And the Moonies. And lots of other cults. They succeed because they are good at recruiting and
deceiving and playing mind games on their victims.
And they are good at playing games to gain money and power.
<p>
And the term &quot;total failure&quot; is accurate. Go read what a member of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant, reported</a> after he
tested A.A. on alcoholics for 8 years:
A zero-percent success rate (zero percent more sobriety than doing nothing),
coupled with an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate.
<p>
A zero-percent success rate along with a 29% death rate is total failure.
</font>
</blockquote>
 
<p>
And, I beg to differ with erroneous point #2<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="blue">
&quot;Those two things have little or nothing to do with each other.&quot;
</font>
<p>
 What!!?? If I am not mistaken, A.A.'s treatment IS spirituality. Yep, that's what the treatment is. That is no secret kept from new people. It is explained in the Doctor Silkworth's Opinion at the forefront of A.A.'s basic text&quot; and in about every chapter thereafter. It is talked about at meetings, at beginner meetings. It's in the steps and read at every meeting. The new person has a choice, stay or go. I fail to see where the big lie is.
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
No A.A. is not spirituality, not unless you consider lying and deceiving and deceptive recruiting
and cult religion to be &quot;spirituality&quot;.
There is a huge difference between superstition and spirituality.
<p>
Likewise, Dr. Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult was not spirituality, either &#8212; it was another
lying cult with some really bad recruiting practices &#8212; and that is what the Twelve Steps are &#8212;
the Oxford Group program for brainwashing the newcomers.
<p>
You &quot;fail to see where the big lie is&quot;? You use that &quot;I fail to see&quot; phrase rather
often. Haven't you noticed that? You are revealing that you refuse to see the truth.
Your failure to see is evidence of nothing but your failure to see.

<p>
Is A.A. supposed to be a quit-drinking program, or is it a religion?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">

<font color="#7f007f" face="Helvetica,SanSerif,Arial">
&quot;
Alcoholics Anonymous
is an international fellowship of men and women who have had a drinking problem.
It is nonprofessional, self-supporting, multiracial, apolitical, and
available almost everywhere. There are no age or education requirements.
Membership is open to anyone who wants to do something about his or her
drinking problem.&quot;</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
Yada, yada, yada. That is the standard propaganda.
Quoting cult propaganda to me doesn't prove anything except that the cult says that.
Notice how they totally forgot to mention the &quot;God&quot; or
&quot;Higher Power&quot; Who is present in half of the 12 Steps.
<p>
That was just another attempt to dodge the point, Injoyon. A.A. is a
cult religion, not a successful treatment for alcoholism.

I have had personal experience with Narcissistic Personality Disorder &#8212;
It's not something you should throw around lightly. These people are
shells of people &#8212; they are incapable of admitting any fault. To
actually look at their part would cause a puncture to their NP that is
too great to withstand. They would never see a specialist or psychologist.
(FYI &#8212; the NPD I know stands at the podium of AA &#8212; it drives me crazy.
I've concluded he is not at fault &#8212; he seems to have been born that way
&#8212; he is genuinely wired differently &#8212; it is all he knows &#8212; it is his very nature.) 
  
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Injoyon. 
<p>
I do not throw that NPD term around lightly. In fact, I did not even use
it for the first few years that I was writing about 
Bill Wilson. I spoke more about delusions of
 grandeur. I only gradually transitioned over to concluding that NPD was
 a very good diagnosis of Bill's behavior after reading a good many books
 about both Bill and NPD.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">You display some interesting behavior yourself. Rather
brazen of you to go so far as to diagnose someone with the same disorder as Hitler.

Less than 1% of the male population has NPD. Everyone to some degree is
Narcissistic. I guess it comes down to just what degree that a person actually has NPD.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
Now that is true.
</font>
</blockquote>


If you really read Bill's writings, he conveys constantly that he has
personal struggles with his ego and his defects and human nature. I have
no doubt he wanted to make money off this thing. He was a salesman, for kripes sake.
 A broke one at that. But to go so far as to insinuate he had no guilt
 or remorse&quot;that he was incapable of love, or that he even got off
on deceit and manipulation&quot; Well, I am not sure that we can say that,
can we? I'd just say (and so did he) he was emotionally immature.
Read &quot;Emotional Sobriety&quot; in Language of the Heart. That explains
a good many A.A.'s
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
A standard characteristic of Narcissistic Personality Disorder is that they fake
remorse and guilt in order to get attention and sympathy.
They aren't really repentant and humble at all.

Bill Wilson even admitted it, by projection. He used
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#preachers_we" target="_blank">The Preacher's We</a></i>
propaganda trick to declare in his second book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We were depressed and complained we felt
bad, when in fact we were mainly asking for sympathy and attention.

a bad motive underneath a good one, permeates human affairs from
top to bottom.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 94.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson couldn't admit that he was doing such things himself, but he was willing to
blame all of the other alcoholics for it.
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
</blockquote>


 
<p>
Do you know that when Bill officially handed over the fellowship his depression lifted? Do you suppose it was an overwhelming burden he carried for reasons unknown to even him? (Like can you imagine it could be possible that even for Bill, there WAS a power bigger than him at work??) 
  
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
 
 Yes, I know that Bill officially handed over the leadership, and I also know that he didn't mean to do it. Bill wanted to appear to be noble and selfless, and he was under the misimpression that the Board of Trustees would just rubber-stamp his dictates. But they didn't. 
<p>
When Bill wanted A.A.W.S. to pay his mistress Helen Wynn out of his royalty income, they concluded that it would be very unwise to mix Bill's sexual affairs with the finances of the Alcoholic Foundation, and told Bill to pay his mistresses himself. Bill was furious at their effrontery. 
<p>
After the Trustees voted against Bill on another issue, Bill wrote a sarcastic self-pitying letter to the Board of Trustees, saying that he hoped that they would still
 see fit to allow him to have an office in the A.A. headquarters. 
<p>
Nan Robertson wrote that Bill Wilson would vacation in Vermont, and then, 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Bill returned home from these trips refreshed, ready to do battle again with the trustees.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Nan Robertson, page 57.
</font>
</blockquote>

 
<p>
The original group of alcoholics had sought out the best and wisest men that they could find to be the Trustees of the Alcoholic Foundation, but all that 
Bill Wilson could do was constantly &quot;do battle&quot; with them and fight to get his own way about everything. 
<p>

<p>
In the end, 
Bill Wilson simply tired of the combat and moved out to the country and spent most of his time at his home <i>Stepping Stones</i>. He didn't go to A.A. meetings and he had very little to do with A.A. any more, other than cashing the royalty checks. Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary, wrote that the other A.A. members were having a hard time accepting the fact that the founder of A.A. was not actually <i>in</i> A.A. any more. 

  
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
Whoowee. None of that surprises me, although I've learned to take everything you say with more than a grain of salt... It's too bad that it has to be that way, but you render many of your points ineffective when much of your examples and proof is presented so one-sided with the purpose of promoting your own bias opinions. The story of Bill and
 his behavior in handing over the fellowship only validates the very principles taught in A.A.- that we need place principles before personalities&quot; because human beings will forever fail us. But my point was that Bill's depression was lifted when the fellowship was handed over to itself  &#8212;  not that it happened or how it happened. Not that I don't appreciate you taking the opportunity to display the antithesis of A.A. principles and participate to the highest degree in yet more character assassination.

<p>
Do you have any evidence that Bill Wilson's depression lifted
<i>because</i>
he quit Alcoholics Anonymous and moved to Vermont? Or was it because of something that his
psychiatrist Dr. Frances Weeks did? Or was it simply time for him to come out of it, after 11 years?

And if you really wanted to keep Bill Wilson's personality from taking precedence over spiritual
principles, you are about 65 years too late. The insanity and dishonesty of the
entire <i>Big Book</i> is Bill Wilson's ego and personality.

Hopefully the traditions and concepts and other A.A. principles will prevail when forces both internally and externally threaten A.A. Human Nature (both good and bad) is prevalent all around in and out of A.A. and A.A. is no different. I hope the
 messengers are never more important than the message and that the structure is never revered more so than the spiritual entity it was designed to hold.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Another aspect of narcissism that was evident in Erich's personality was
his need to project an image. He presented himself as someone committed
to &quot;doing good for others,&quot; to use his words. But this image
was a perversion of reality. What he called &quot;doing good for others&quot;
represented an exercise of power over them, which, despite his stated
good intentions, verged on the diabolical. Under the guise of doing good,
for instance, Erich exploited his girlfriend: He got her to love him
without any loving response on his part. Such exploitativeness is common
to all narcissistic personalities.<br>

Why not remain objective &#8212; your points would be far better met then.

Actually, I try very hard to be objective, like when I insist on
Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies to support claims of success

<p>
And everybody, including A.A., Rational Recovery, SMART, and any other
treatment program must meet the same strict standards of proof before
they claim success. And
<a href="orange-letters12.html#SMART_success_rate" target="_blank">I don't even credit
SMART with anything more than a two percent success rate</a>, above
normal spontaneous remission (which is 5%, so SMART gets a total success
rate of maybe 7%). That is being objective. 

<p>
Perhaps you meant something other than
&quot;objective&quot;. Perhaps you meant non-critical or unemotional,
like that I am not supposed to feel contempt for people who calmly lie
to sick people about what will cure them. If you are looking for that
kind of emotional deadness, well, you won't find it here.

It's great you offer information and even a forum for folks who do not
wish to stay or like A.A. Again, I just wish your personal opinions
weren't so abundant throughout your essays. And there are so many of
them. Like I said, I keep coming accross your work - when I don't want to!

<p>
Here's my testimony - I thought I'd use that word for your benefit...
  
<p>
Me: Drunk. Setting fire to mattresses, incapeable of keeping down food, let alone keeping a job. Disowned.
 Formerly. Nothing worked  --  the most expensive rehabs money will buy. Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Therapists, Doctors, Meds, More Doctors and more Meds. More tests, more diagnosis. Sex. Sex relations and more sex. Running out of money, running out of steam, running out of life. County funded to treatment. Running out. Running. Burning clothes, burning matteresses, burning bridges. Every turn a closed door. Every bridge burned. Hate. I hate myself. Puke. Sores. Withdrawal.
<p>
No where to go. 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
So the doctors didn't make you quit drinking?
How could they?
What were they supposed to do, insert wires into your brain and burn out the brain cells
that craved your feel-goods?
<p>
Or were they supposed to get out the drills and bone saws and scalpels and do brain surgery on you?
<p>
I mean really, how could they possibly &quot;make you&quot; quit drinking?
<p>
What were they supposed to do, make you into an obedient little robot? And that didn't work?
Well why not?
<p>
That whole A.A. speech about &quot;nothing worked until A.A.&quot; is bogus.
(By the way, you are just parrotting the standard A.A. spiel. I'm not impressed.
That is just the zillionth rerun of the standard cult show routine,
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">The cult is the ONLY WAY</a>.&quot;)

<p>
The truth is that nothing worked until you quit drinking.
When you finally got sick and tired of being sick and tired, you quit. Before then,
you refused to quit. You drank because you wanted to drink. You had sex because you
wanted to have sex. And you quit that behavior when you wanted to.

<p>
And I notice your mention of expensive rehabs. Since 93% of the treatment
facilities in the U.S.A. use 12-Step programs, it must have been the
12 Steps that were failing you again and again, wasn't it?
<p>
How much did you pay for &quot;28 Days of Introduction to 12-Step Religion, 101&quot;?

 One open door. One extended hand. One heart
 speaking to mine. Hope. Another day. Might make another day. More. Need more of that. Fill me up fill me with something. Anything. Failed relationships. Manipulation, Manipulated. Relapse. Leaving. Coming back. The hand. Still there, there is the hand. It will take more to melt the icy heart this time. Fianc�e - on methadone. Dead. Gone. Four years gone. Persistance. Determination. I want what they have. I'm willing. I want it. I want the hurting to stop. 95 pounds. A shell. Void. Void of self. Void of love. Void of spirit. Barely alive. I'm an emotional retard. Fix me.

Resentment is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die. Resentment eats the container it holds.

There is no spiritual condition when resentment fills a heart, let alone the capacity to MAINTAIN one. Again, I almost relapse. I'm destined to walk this earth a wrestles soul. But I learn. I am knocked off the beam easily. I learn. Others have the power. I react. I learn. I fall short of my chosen ideals. But I learn.
<p>
Fears. Reacting to fears. Most are self-centered. Most are false. Most are irrational. Most are made-up stories. Laughter. &quot;If you're going to make up a story, might as well make up a good one&quot; ha ha ha. They help me walk through my fear. I start becoming
 human, interacting, laughing. I start laughing.

<p>
He was hiding In the last place I'd ever think to look, when I had looked everywhere else, I found a power deep down within me. All along it was in &quot;the book&quot; but it was still the last place I looked. There's that sense of humor again. &quot;Deep down every man woman and child lies the fundamental idea of God and it is there we must look&quot;. That is where I looked. That is where I found.

Today: Sober. Tax paying, law abiding. Citizen. A part of. No longer a part from.
 Participating. Enjoying. INJOYON. Laughter. Love, Care, throughtfulness, consideration, integrity, self worth. SELF. Ideals  --  striving for ideals. MY ideals. No one elses. MINE. Actually living and being someone I like. I can grow in whatever image I choose (I choose my conception of God that I won't go into right now) in and out of A.A. I don't need A.A. to do this. I've learned this the hard way.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
Okay, so it's good that you quit drinking.

You just have no idea of how good it can get.
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And here is the best testimony of all: A.A. showed me how to live up to
my own ideals  --  no one elses  --  my own for me. When I fall short,
I learn. I make amends and I learn. 
 
<p>
But the greatest freedom of all
Is that you can slander A.A. and twist and turn everything to feed your vindictiveness
when I believe I'd be 6 feet under with my first fianc&eacute;e without A.A. yes I can
still be free to continue to strive for my own ideals.
<p>
In other words, regardless of how others are behaving or how I perceive
I am being treated&quot;. They do not dictate who I am or how I behave today.
I can still be open minded to learn and read and try to see another's
perspective.&nbsp;Something happened to you - and I wish we could just
talk about that instead of all this other stuff.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
You are quick to accuse me of slandering A.A., but you are woefully short on facts.

And you keep running away when I mention the big important issues, like the A.A. success or failure

and the heresy of the A.A. theology. Would you care to talk about those things?
Oh, and by the way, how many suicides have you had in your groups during your years in A.A.?
<p>
I really wish those wonderful spiritual ideals that A.A. taught you included rigorous
honesty and telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous.

If you won't tell the truth about those issues, then you have no room to accuse me of
slandering Alcoholics Anonymous.

Subject:   	Re: question for you<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I was wondering... if you despise A.A. then you must feel the same way
 about the other 12-step programs?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yep. Although some I despise even more, like when I see how Al-Anon and Alateen hurt children.
Read the file about
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">Snake Oil</a> for the lowdown on the other 12-Step &quot;programs&quot;.
</font>
<p>

And I just want to point out -- you hate the practice of teaching powerlessness... however, when you get further into the program (after sticking it out for a while) you realize what they are talking about is the ineffective use of self-will... of which, any addict (sex addict, drug addict, alcohol addict) has to admit, their way was not exactly working for them... as much as they applied their own will, their own &quot;instincts&quot; lead them quite astray. The steps merely remove that which is blocking one from reaching that power that will prove to be a bit less SELF(destructive) DIRECTED... I'm sure you will argue that's brainwashing. Whatever, when I got sober I was afraid people could read my mind -- that's how junked up mine was -- it needed a good cleaning out.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well again, that is a bunch of crippling and harmful B.S. -- &quot;the ineffective use of self-will&quot;.
<p>
So the answer is to surrender your will and become the slave of Somebody Else?
<p>
Yes, that is the cult answer.
<p>
And you are assuming all kinds of erroneous things, like
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;their way was not exactly working for them... as much as they
 applied their own will, their own &quot;instincts&quot; lead them quite astray.&quot;
</font>

<p>
That is just flat-out wrong.
The truth is that addicts are conflicted and of two minds. They want to quit their addiction
and get healthy, and they also want another hit or another drink right now, to feel better right now.
Both of those things are &quot;their will&quot; and &quot;their way&quot;.
<p>
The Steps do not remove
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;that which is blocking one from reaching that power...&quot;<br>
</font>

What the Steps remove is clear thinking, self-reliance, and self-respect.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#five_C" target="_blank">
Dr. Frank Buchman designed those practices</a> to brainwash new members of his religious cult,
and that is what they do.
(So you were right about me arguing that it is brainwashing. Now what will it take for
you to realize that it <i>*really is*</i> brainwashing?)

<p>
Yes, you say that 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Whatever, when I got sober I was afraid people could read my mind -- that's how junked up mine was -- it needed a good cleaning out.&quot;
</font>
<p>
So you had some problems with mild paranoia when you detoxed. That does not mean that you
needed to get brainwashed.

<p>
Notice the similarity of that with other obnoxious cults:
<p>
What the cult leader Rev. Sun Myung Moon of the Moonies said was
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Americans' minds are so dirty,
so full of sex and drugs and sin, that their brains need a good
washing.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The leader of the Synanon pseudo-recovery cult,
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#Dederich_washing" target="_blank">Chuck Dederich, said</a>,
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Of course, we brainwash in Synanon. The dirty brains we get
all the time need to be washed for Chrissake!&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>

Oh yes, the cults are eager to wash your brain out for you.
</font>
<p>

Or you just hate that it leads people to develop and rely upon something
that can't fail them (like people...)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you assume things that are totally out of touch with reality.
A.A. does not work at all. It has the same success rate as doing nothing, but has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">a much higher death rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">a higher rearrest rate</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">a higher binge drinking rate</a>.
It is a disaster, not a wonderful solution to a bad problem.
</font>
<p>
I can't figure if you don't believe in God at all, or you are a fundamentalist.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Good. I will let you keep wondering. As long as you can't pigeon-hole me, you
might have to think about what I am saying.
</font>
<p>

I cannot put that much time into reading all your stuff, but I wondered
 if you feel the same way about all the other 12-step programs or is it
 just Bill Wilson's A.A.?

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is all of them. We covered that above.

Subject:  	AA

<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>
I stumbled upon your website well over a year ago and am glad your
back and posting letters again.
<p>
I attended my first meeting Oct. 22, 1983 and have not had a drink
since the day before my first meeting. I know exactly why I have
remained sober ever since. It is not because of the steps, sponsors,
sponsoring, helping others, prayers or attending meetings. I immediately
bought into the AA philosophy and became obsessed from the very start.
<p>
It was my overwhelming obsession with AA that kept me sober. I wanted to
stay sober so that I could become Mr. AA, guru, BB quoter, meeting
chairman, wonderful sponsor and just an all around really great guy!
As the years went on I began to question some of the smaller points in
AA.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
If AA works so well, why has the group remained the same size for the
past ten years?

<p>

<li>
If we are powerless, how can we just not drink today?

<p>

<li>
If the steps really work, why have many gone on to drink and drug after
working the steps?

<p>

<li>
If AA is such a spiritual program, why do so many AAers commit so many
immoral acts while sober?

<p>

<li>
Why are the best speakers in meetings held in such high regard, when
their only asset is speaking?
(One fellow talks at every meeting very eloquently and never says
anything of substance.)

<p>

<li>
One of the greatest lines used in AA to dismiss another's point of view
is &quot;That's just your selfishness talking&quot;
</ul>

<p>

I could go on &amp; on with this but I've said enough. When I discovered
this site I was very curious and upset with your attack of AA. It wasn't
your writing that helped to clear my head, it was the replies that
attempted to defend AA. I read every response to you hoping that some of
the wiser AAers would step up to defend the flag.
<p>
All that I saw were vain attempts by use of the AA rhetoric. In the
end it was the AAers that showed me the truth of AA. I have weaned
myself from the obsession of AA since discovering this site. I no longer
have a need to battle to be right or be a needy person. I still converse
with my sponsor because he is my friend, and I allow him his views. In a
couple of weeks it will be 22 years of sobriety for me and I have never
been so free.
<p>
Thanks Orange for the lively discussion you have brought forth.

<p>

Hello Bill,

Subject:  	sounds like a resentment

<p>

dear orange,I resent bill wilson    the cause: for being liar. affects
my: self esteem (fear), personal relations,security,pocketbook. where
had i been selfish? i didn't want him to be a liar. dishonest: i have
never been a liar. self seeking: i slandered him to the world on the
internet. fear: of being a liar. putting out of our minds what others
have done.we resolutely look at our own mistakes.the very thing people
criticize bill for is exactly what and who they are. in other words if
bill did what people say he did he had to live with it.even if we are
wronged by someone we are still wrong by self seeking(criticizing him
and judging him). i hope people understand the value of looking at our
part in all of our affairs. thank you and god bless  chip b. livonia,
mi.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Chip,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I'm having trouble ferretting out the actual message in there, but I
see this in particular:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the very thing people criticize bill for is exactly what and who they are.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is obviously nonsense. If you criticize someone for
committing murder, does that mean that you are guilty of murdering someone?
Of course not. If you criticize Bill Wilson for being a philandering thieving
phony guru, does that make you one? No, it doesn't.
<p>
Then you parrot
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#accept_anything" target="_blank">one of Bill Wilson's worst lines</a>:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;even if we are wronged by someone we are still wrong by self seeking(criticizing him and judging him).&quot;
</font>
<p>

Again, that is patently untrue nonsense. It is not a spiritual failing to
criticize evil.
In fact, it is a spiritual wrong to <i>not</i> criticize and oppose evil.
<p>
Those statements reveal just how much A.A. has crippled you and made you unable
to function in the real world. You can't even fight against wrongs because
you are too busy turning the attack on yourself.
That's great for keeping you a subservient slave in a cult, but not good for
much else.

<p>
Your subject line mentions resentments. Oh, is that a popular subject this weekend.
 I just wrote about that subject a few letters ago, so
<a href="orange-letters26.html#resentment" target="_blank">look here</a> for the answer.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I must say that I find it strange that you can have so much bad things

Hi again :-)

<p>

But you are using standard propaganda techniques all the time... Why is
that?

<p>

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Emil,
<p>
The simple answer is that it is impossible to carry on a debate without using debating
techniques. Like I said at the start of the web page on propaganda and debating techniques,
<p>
<blockquote>
Any time you are trying to convince anyone of something, you are
using some kind of persuasion, debating, or propaganda technique.
Just telling the whole truth about something is one simple propaganda
technique, and a highly effective one.
But lying often works better, at least with some audiences...
</blockquote>

<p>
The big question is, is someone using honest persuasion techniques, like telling the truth,
listing true facts, and using reason and valid logic, or is someone lying and deceiving
and using all of the dishonest, under-handed propaganda techniques?
<p>
I try to make sure that I only use the good techniques as I argue my case.
It's tempting to stoop to easy, low attacks, but I try to avoid the temptation.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Hello there A O....

<p>

Hi,

<p>

Rev Sam shoemaker once said, &quot;you can argue the interpretation of an
experience.... However, you must acknowledge the experience within
itself.&quot; Therefore if we must acknowledge someone's experience then why
would we want to challenge it in any way??? I found that when I looked
deep into myself the answer was very fulfilling once I could accept
it....... Even though it was tough and meant I had to give up lots of my
&quot;old ideas&quot; about life and my life's preconceived ideas which were based
on the past I had experienced...... Maybe you could let me know what you
personally think eh.....

<p>

Patrick.........

<p>

PS.....I know &quot;why&quot; Yahoo did what they did.....Do you???

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Patrick,
<p>
About Shoemaker's &quot;acknowledging the experience...&quot;<br>
All I can say is, &quot;What a bunch on nonsensical double-talk.&quot; It is meaningless
garbage.
<p>
So someone has an experience? So what? An experience can be anything from making love
to taking out the garbage. The fact that someone has an experience does not
necessarily mean that the experience is good or valuable or educational or spiritual
or anything else.

<p>
Sam was erroneously assuming that somehow all claims of &quot;religious experiences&quot;
were valid or genuine or somehow valuable. That is a false assumption.
<p>
What about the person who mistakes mawkish sentimentality for a religious experience?
<p>
What about the person who confuses wishful thinking with having a religious experience?
<p>
What about the person who insists that getting all choked up while singing
&quot;Onward Christian Soldiers&quot; is a real religious experience?
<p>
What about the military enthusiast who says that marching in formation with a big army gives
him a religious experience?

<p>
And the most extreme question is, &quot;What about the people who felt that listening to
Adolf Hitler giving a rousing speech was a religious experience?&quot;

<p>
We not only <i><b>can</b></i> challenge someone's experience, we have to, when
they are making extraordinary claims, like that they are getting a &quot;genuine religious
experience&quot; from something or other.

<p><br>
And no, I don't know exactly why Yahoo erased my web site.
Do you know something about it that I don't know?
<p>
Have a good day.

it......Your trying to unscramble eggs here and PLEASE, let me know how
that works for you ok......Try using your obsessive actions to your
advantage instead of trying to justify why AA won't work coz you haven't
personally had enough of your own suffering yet....Oh, do you know what
SELF-delusion means??? of course you do don't you...Therefore it's not
self delusion for you it's belligerant denial ( consciously lying to
yourself. ) There was just one beautiful spot though about your web
site........Thanks for the good pictures of everyone, I can use them for
my AA activities,lol......

Hi, I'd just like to write and say thank you very much for reminding me
how sceptical, cynical, agnostic, disbelieving and judgemental I used to
be...Reading your articles brought it home to me how emotionally sick I
was only 2 years ago and I'd have bought into the idea of this website
and drowned again in my illness....Once again, thank you very much for
reminding me where I came from in my illness....It's people like you I
need to understand then I can  get a sense of ease and comfort with the
world and all it's people without feeling the need for a drink
again....Keep up the good work and I don't know if you know it but
you're 12 stepping people into recovery, effectively...

<p>

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Re: A.A.

<p>
Hello again Terrance. Greetings from Scotland. The first thing I want to
do is thank you very much for your reply to my letter. Now, why did it
take me 13 months to reply &#8212; because I have just read it today!! How
come? &#8212; because I have had no idea what an &quot;attached web page&quot; or an
&quot;attachment&quot; was!!!!!! Shame. I am a retired engineer who used and
programmed computers for 30 years as dedicated design, control and
diagnostic tools. I never had the slightest interest in the net or
emails. Last year I was gifted an old PC
and I have dabbled about with &quot;Google&quot; and &quot;Outlook Express&quot;. I never
knew what a paper clip in the top right corner was until this morning.
Most of the emails I have received in the past 20 months seem to have
automatically shown the attachments on screen but I have had a few
surprises opening the remaining paper clips. So, what a plonker, eh?
<p>
Your reply shows that you and I are on EXACTLY the same
wavelength.....say no more.
<p>
I cannot stress enough just how reading your essays last year has
utterly transformed my psyche. Talk about a paradigm shift, from AA guru
to to sane, healthy, well-adjusted normality &#8212; and that's my wife's,
sons', and best friend's opinion. You now have seven &quot;acolytes&quot; here in
Glasgow! We still attend AA meetings and do our best to (tactfully)
spike zealot's guns and keep fragile newcomers away from &quot;bum steers&quot;
(dangerous misleading advice). Having broken free from the cult
stranglehold, we have asked ourselves why we are attending meetings and
we have to admire the AA Preamble as a &quot;mission statement&quot;. The Preamble
is simple, solid and above criticism and if that was all AA was about,
(and not about), it would be an admirable fellowship playing its part in
early recovery assistance, especially &quot;you are no longer alone&quot;. Have
you any thoughts on the Preamble? ... other than the obvious bait in
&quot;bait and switch&quot;.
<p>
I have not &quot;logged on&quot; to your site for about a year because my son
downloaded the lot on to a CD and I just use that. I have now just had a
quick look at it and I see a complete update so that will be my reading
for the next few hours. I have printed out most of your website during
the last year and it is one hell of a mountain of A4! .... the book is
long overdue.

<p>
Take care and very best regards, Gordon.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Gordon,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. It's very flattering, a little overwhelming
really, to hear that I have &quot;acolytes&quot; in Glasgow. (Now I really can't relapse,
I'll disappoint all of my followers... :-)
<p>
By the way, I am descended from the Glasgow crowd, about 3 generations ago (among other things).
MacGillivary clan from Glasgow. (Oh, and also Ireland. That Terrance name isn't a joke.)
<p>
Sorry to hear that you were confused by the attachment. (It is funny in a way.)
I almost always answer letters with a web page because the web page format is convenient
and makes links possible. I send the same web page to the correspondent, and also
put the contents of the web page into another file of letters.
That saves me the bother of having to write things twice, in two different formats.
And the HTML format is the only thing that makes links work correctly.
I often don't feel like retyping stuff again, so I just point
a link at where I already said the same thing before. 
It's also very convenient, how easy it is, in HTML, to have the text of
the original letter and response in two different colors to make the
reading easier.

<p><br>
About the Preamble. I am not 100% sure what you mean, but I think you must mean the
opening statements that are read out loud at the start of every A.A. meeting,
beginning with &quot;RARELY have we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path...&quot;
That is, the plastic-laminated dogma from pages 58 to 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>.

<p>
As a statement of purpose, of ideals, it is wonderful. It sounds great.
Just some recovering alcoholics getting together to give aid and comfort to each other
and seeking to rescue others from Hell.
And to the extent that A.A. lives those ideals, that's the best part of A.A.. 
<p>
Alas, I always have to grit my (non-existent) teeth at the
&quot;RARELY have we seen a person fail&quot; line
because I know what the truth is. And that is what sours the whole experience for me.
When you have to start every meeting by reciting things that you flat-out know are not
true, it makes a mockery of all of the talk about &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;.

<p>
And then I object to Bill Wilson's blame-the-victim attitude in declaring that those people for whom
The Program doesn't work are just genetically defective, &quot;born that way&quot;.

<p>
Then of course there is the assumption that the Twelve Steps actually work to cure
or treat alcoholism, which they don't, really.
<p>
But if A.A. were what it claims to be, just a friendly little neighborhood sobriety club,
then it could be a wonderful thing. That is why I look hopefully at things like
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709132125/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="_blank">SMART</a>,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709132125/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="_blank">SOS</a>,
and
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709132125/http://www.unhooked.com/index.htm" target="_blank">LifeRing</a>,
which might grow into very good things.
<p>
I mean, I will basically be interested in <i>any</i> sobriety self-help organization 
or treatment program that doesn't ask me to recite a pack of lies to the newcomers.

This line that you wrote is really great:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;We still attend AA meetings and do our best to (tactfully)
spike zealot's guns and keep fragile newcomers away from &quot;bum steers&quot;
(dangerous misleading advice).&quot;
</font>
<p>
YES!!! In the past, I have made jokes about the &quot;Newcomer Rescue League&quot; &#8212; a mythical
secret organization of sane people who go to A.A. meetings to save the newcomers from
the bad sponsors. It was just a joke, but there really should be such an organization.
It sounds like it really exists after all. Thank you.
<p>
Thanks again for the letter, and have a good day.

Subject:  	Re: A.A.

<p>

Hello again Terrance. Greetings from Scotland. Thank you for your reply
and I completely agree with your sentiments. Yes, you were not 100% sure
about what I meant by the Preamble. What you were confusing and rightly
condemning was &quot;How it works&quot;, an excerpt from Chapter 5 of Alcoholics
Anonymous. In my visits to North America this seemed to be mandatory
reading, but it is seldom read out at Scottish meetings (only of the
&quot;holy roller&quot; variety). Our mandatory laminated sheet at all meetings is
the Preamble which goes as follows:-

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Courier,Helvica,Utopia" color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous is a Fellowship of men and women who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their
common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.
The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There
are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through
our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination,
politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any
controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes.
Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to
achieve sobriety&quot;.
<p>
(Above copyright 1947 by the A.A. Grapevine, Inc.; reprinted here with f*** all permission).
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This reading is an ABSOLUTE ritual here and it is what I was referring
to as &quot;simple, solid and above criticism&quot;. By the way, the word
&quot;Preamble&quot; is not in our vocabulary and we have to explain to all
newcomers that it is Americanese for &quot;Introduction&quot;. Some meetings here
have a further reading but it is an innocuous quote such as  &quot;Just for
Today&quot;, &quot;The Promises&quot;, &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;, etc.
Most of our real old-timers take the Preamble as their Mission Statement
and dislike the &quot;airy fairy&quot; 12 steps; they are dying out and the
cult is taking over but we can try and stick to first principles. I was
at a meeting last night where the &quot;top table&quot; sharer said that she
was,&quot;18 months dry in AA and then had a glass of white wine in a
restaurant, now I am nearly a year sober&quot;. I commented that surely she
was two and a half years sober and she said that her sponsor told her
she had &quot;thrown away&quot; the 18 months and they didn't count for anything!
What utter desperate drivel! The horror of brainwashing is that I used
to say and believe that kind of guilt-inducing nonsense. (I had a long
talk with her at the tea break and put her right, mayby another convert!)

<p>
So I hope that clarifies why we are still attending meetings,
<p>
Best
Regards and take care.<br>
Gordon.

<p>
p.s. I like your foot-note about Shr&ouml;dinger's cat!.... very good. Reminds
me of:-<br>
An American politician, statistician and particle physicist came on a
hiking holiday in Scotland. They came over a rise and there was a black
sheep on the trail.<br>
Politician: &quot;Look!... the sheep in Scotland are black!<br>
Statistician: &quot;Well.... at least one sheep in Scotland is black.<br>
Particle physicist: Well...... on one side anyway......<br>
