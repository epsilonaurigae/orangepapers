These guys are real characters. They are very feisty. I've seen coots get right in the face of

And they will actually stare down their opponent.

The goslings are back to the parking lot. Those guys are funny: They are very timid and standoffish when
I approach them on the other side of the pond, but they are happy to come to the parking lot and
get handouts from people, including me. Perhaps it is just a matter of who approaches whom.
They are okay with coming to the parking lot and approaching people, but when I approach them

Subject:  	Introduction<br>

<p>
Hi! My name is Rob and I've been sober for 14 months. I just finished
reading the Introduction and I have a couple points of discussion.

<p>
It's mentioned that: &quot;That unethical behavior is being financed with the
public's tax money and health insurance money.&quot; All the AA groups in my
district here in Canada follow the 7th Tradition. To my knowledge, I havn't
heard of or seen any groups in Canada being publicy funded. Isn't this
broad statement then false and misleading?

<p>
And, &quot;Well, it didn't work. She relapsed repeatedly, and they kicked her
out of the program.&quot; While very unfortunate if true, no decent AA group
would do that to someone who is sick and suffering. Please don't paint all
of AA with the same brush. Our group is open to all who have the desire to
stop drinking. Your thoughts please? Thanks.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and congratulations on your sobriety.
<p>
What you are doing is trying to separate Alcoholics Anonymous from treatment programs that are
based on Alcoholics Anonymous. That is a false distinction. Now I know that legally, they are
separate entities, just like how all of the A.A. clubhouses in the USA (and Canada) are legally separate
entities from Alcoholics Anonymous The Corporation in New York City. But in reality, they are inseparably entwined.
There is no separating them.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is like an octopus with many tenacles. The friendly neighborhood A.A. meeting
is only one arm of Alcoholics Anonymous the Entity.
(Or &quot;The Evil Empire&quot;, as I like to call it.)
Other branches include two A.A. corporate headquarters in New York City &#8212; A.A.W.S. and the G.S.O. &#8212; 
the publishing house, the numerous councils and intergroups around the world,
the fake medical authorities, the treatment center racket,
and a propaganda unit that would make Joseph Goebbels proud.

<p>
Those corrupt treatment programs that do kick people out are all staffed by A.A. true believers.
Those treatment programs sell the A.A. philosophy and cult religion and superstitions, just the
same as you will find in any A.A. meeting.
The treatment centers also provide employment for A.A. members who are otherwise unemployable.
It doesn't take a lot of training or intelligence
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="_blank">or even sanity</a>
to tell people to go to at least three A.A. meetings per week and get a sponsor,
and then parrot some slogans at them.

<p>
A.A. very much benefits from those 12-Step treatment centers. They are a major source of new recruits for
Alcoholics Anonymous. The A.A. headquarters has never objected to those treatment centers selling A.A.
for anything from $1700 to $40,000. The A.A. headquarters was quick to
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">sue A.A. members in Mexico and
Germany for publishing their own translations of the old out-of-copyright first edition of the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
but the A.A. headquarters does not sue treatment centers for selling A.A.
for a big profit.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous also uses front groups:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://www.ncadd.org/" target="_blank">NCADD</a>, the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://www.asam.org/" target="_blank">ASAM</a>, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (aimed at doctors)
<li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005144/http://www.naadac.org/" target="_blank">NAADAC</a>, the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors
(obviously, for counselors)
</ul>
Again, they exist to promote A.A., but they are not legally connected.

<p>
In fact, that legal structure is deliberate. All of those other legal entities can promote A.A. and
commit all kinds of crimes while selling A.A. to the masses, but A.A. in New York cannot be sued for their activities.
And when a <i>not-legally-associated</i> allied organization does something that is particularly disgusting or repulsive,
the A.A. headquarters can object to the criticism that they receive
and claim that they didn't do it, it has nothing to do with them.
Cute trick, huh? That is why
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_front_groups" target="_blank">cults use front groups</a>.
<p>
There is more on A.A.'s front groups here:

Subject:<br>

<p>
Hi again

<p>
I am impressed with the way you respond to abuse from the steppers and the way that
you use accredited research to answer what in many cases amounts to nothing more
than slogans/one liners and rehashed hearsay. If the spiritual giants who abuse you
would just take the time to step ( no pun intended ) back and look at the way they
respond/relate to you they would possibly see how very unattractive their spiritual
message is. I am not referring to their beliefs and the fact that they disagree with
you in many instances: just to the manner in which they behave toward someone with
opinions of their own. I suppose 'live and let live' only applies if they agree with
someone.

<p>
I read an article recently in which the author spoke of her recovery from anorexia
and in which she offered some advice to others with the same problem. As soon as I
read the following I realised how sensible this part of her advice was and how so
different to that which the steppers give.
<b>&quot;Don't be a full-time anorexic..... the less you're out in the real world, meeting
real people, getting on with life, the more anorexia will come to define you.&quot;</b>
<p>
Recently I read in one of your letters about A.A.s sitting in meetings pretending to
be sick and that hit a note as well as the above.

<p>
Too often A.A.s come to believe that they are special and different and meetings are
full of talk describing thoughts, actions and feelings as being ALCOHOLIC
thoughts, ALCOHOLIC actions and ALCOHOLIC feelings as if alcoholics had a monopoly on
these things. I always tried to say that most of what was being described was
actually HUMAN thoughts, actions and feelings but too many were happy to be victims.
I eventually came to believe that many were scared of going out into the real world
where years of clean time counts for nothing and were happy to be full-time
(recovering) alcoholics, happy to describe themselves as insane and content to play
the victim until eventually becoming an old timer.

<p>
If you make A.A. the most important thing in you life ....
the most important thing in your life is A.A.

<p>
Being sober is great and I would not be alive today if I had not stopped drinking
almost 18 years ago but I am not defined by what I was but who I am.
<p>
As an A.A. member I was asked to sponsor many people and one of my experiences I
used to share with sponsees was about my newspaper reading habits.
When I was young I would always read the sports pages first and then move on to the
rest of the paper. Later I would read the political pages first. Now I read the
obituaries first and have learnt that when someone dies it is not the money in the
bank or the number of houses or the number of expensive cars or any number of THINGS
that count ... it is the way that we have lived that is important.

<p>
Keep up the good work

Hi,

<p>
Thanks for putting all the information together.

<p>
Please allow me to offer some advice:

<p>
It might be helpful to set up a companion site
which is a distillation of the whole archive.

<p>
Your site is packed with information and it is
kind of overwhelming...no offense to your fine
work but I think you repeat yourself and/or
overlap information.

<p>
Basically your site is an overgrown bush that
needs a trimming.

<p>
Can't say I'm surprised. People, including professionals, don't even
have much respect for disabled humans, let alone disabled animals. It's
better to be dead than disabled, especially when you're a wild animal.
Reminds me of horses who get put down for having broken legs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Yes. And there is also a Nazi element to it, too. The Nazis claimed that they were
euthanizing people who were living &quot;lives not worth living&quot;. You know, &quot;the mental defectives,
and the cripples, and the chronically sick.&quot; And then the political dissidents and the Jews.
<p>
I hear the same philosophy from what I call &quot;Nature Nazis&quot; who recommend euthanizing wild animals
for a variety of complaints, including &quot;imprinting&quot;. Imprinting is what a baby bird does when
it hatches out. It memorizes what its parents look like very soon. It can identify its parents
generally within an hour or two, and it has totally memorized what Mama looks like within 24 hours,
and it can pick her out of a flock and won't confuse her with some other goose, and it will
remember what she looks like for the rest of its life. Then the baby bird does the same thing
with Father in the next 24 hours.
<p>
The Nature Nazis say that baby birds that have imprinted on humans should be euthanized because
they have been contaminated with human contact and &quot;won't survive in the wild so well&quot;.
<p>
That whole thing about surviving in the wild is an illusion. The Nature Nazis talk like 
the Indians are still riding horses across the Great Plains, chasing the buffalo, and the skies are
darkened with the flocks of Passenger Pigeons, and the huge flocks of Canada Geese live out
in the wilderness and never have any contact with humans.
<p>
But that dream world ended over a hundred years ago. The Indians got moved onto reservations, and they
drive pickup trucks, and if they have any buffalo, they herd them around the reservation.
The Passenger Pigeons are extinct. People have covered the geese's feeding grounds with farms and
cities, and the Canada Geese have been moved onto reservations, too &#8212; things called
&quot;wildlife preserves&quot; or &quot;city parks&quot; &#8212; where they collect
bread tributes from people as payment of rent on their land.
</font>
<p>
I don't think fixing broken legs in geese would that be much different
than fixing them in humans. I would think one of the more difficult
parts would be keeping the goose from pecking at the leg.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Agreed. But I think that keeping the goose from pecking its leg would be easy.
If it is wrapped in a cast, then the leg is protected.

I feel for that goose. If I had known that a predator was going to kill her that night,
I would have made my best attempt to catch her without hurting her, and cared for her as best I could.
But getting antibiotics and preventing infection is a big problem. Painkillers and anesthetics would be nice too.
Maybe a friendly veterinarian could help.

<p>
I just looked up the lake in question (it's a big, well-known lake in
the state), and apparently it does have a large Canada goose population.
Also, hunting geese is apparently legal there. Bah. Never got the appeal
of hunting for sport, rather than for food.

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Sport&quot;? I like the <i>Bloom County</i> take on it. The animals had a hunting season
for hunters. When the humans were out hunting geese, the Bloom County animals stalked the humans.
One of the little animals looked through binoculars and saw some
human hunters, and said, &quot;Hey! That's a Fat-bellied Stogie-Sucker, and them's good eatin'.&quot;
Then the animal went over to the human hunters and asked if they tasted best roasted, boiled, 
or fried. And the humans reacted by saying, &quot;Why you animals!&quot;

There was quite a bit of grumbling about the autism-related changes,
too. Mostly from the aspie supremacists. &quot;What do you mean we're being

correspond with your bigotry, isn't it? Amanda put things pretty well

As for the dorm issue, I think I probably would have eaten better there
if those appliances were allowed. And if the on-campus convenience
stores stocked more than junk food. Or if there was actually a grocery
store within walking distance.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, really. I shudder when I think of those junk-food diets.

This is the first time I've hear anything about the Book of Mormon being
edited, though I'm not surprised that pointing that out is an
ex-communicable offense. My friend's still a Mormon, so most of my
information about Mormonism comes from her rose-colored lenses. That,
and the Internet.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, since the <i>Book of Mormon</i> is allegedly a new revelation from God that was given
to Mankind on golden tablets by an angel, editing and changing the word of God is a serious issue.
Kind of hard to explain, too.
</font>
<p>
And about the egg, that's very exciting! My family used to have
chickens, but it never occurred to me to smell the eggs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You might have trouble distinguishing the smell of the eggs from the smell of poultry.
They are similar.
Again, it's real subtle, and I mostly get it when the egg is warm. I put my nose right
down on the warm egg, and its there. Faint and subtle, but there.
<p>
The big deal is that I'm not smelling any sulphur dioxide rotten-egg smell.

</font>
<p>
Anyhow, happy Mother's Day to the expecting Mother Goose.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks. About 6 or 8 days to go.
Things are looking good. Like I said in the postscript after the last letter to you, I measured
carefully, and found that the egg is about two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than its surroundings.
That is a very good sign. That is how it should be. The gosling is a warm-blooded little bird with a hot
body, and it is starting to establish its own body temperature. (That takes a while. Even newly-hatched
babies have trouble keeping themselves warm. That is why they return to Mother and cuddle with her
often when they are very young.)
<p>
Have a good day now.

No problem. I had been very much hoping there was an alternative to AA,
having spent some time on an online chat server for AA people. I really
hoped I could quit drinking in the same way I have quit smoking, I hate
to think I'm &quot;helpless&quot; &#8212; your pages made me realise
there is no mystical rubbish I need to go through, it gave me back what
I suspected, that it's down to me alone whether I drink or not.

This eagle has captured a fish, and it is carrying the fish home to its nest, where it has a baby.
Unfortunately, none of the nature photographers who like to frequent the Fernhill Wetlands has managed to
get a picture of the baby, because it is nestled down in the nest, and the photographers are all shooting up from below.
But there is no doubt that the two eagles who have a nest way up in a big tree have a baby.
They are feeding it like this all of the time. Something down in that nest has a huge appetite.

Subject:  	AA and alcoholism<br>

<p>
Hi A. Orange,

<p>
I found your website when I did a Google search on the efficacy of AA in treating
alcoholism.  I have had doubts regarding their philosophy and from the very first
meeting (I've only been to 2 so far), I felt a cult-like atmosphere although
everyone seemed to be very nice and nonjudgmental.  I believe you are correct when
you say that if a person is truly &quot;sick and tired of feeling sick and tired&quot; they
will stop drinking; humans can think and make decisions on their own if they are
truly motivated to change (Free Will).  I always drank and did drugs as a teenager
but straightened out when I had my first child.  I had times when I drank too much
but it never became an ongoing bad habit until my mother died in April of 2009.  I
gradually began to drink more and more over the last 3 years, and on Sunday, May 13,
2012, Mother's Day, I out did myself by drinking more in 1 day than I've ever had
before.
<p>
On Monday, I woke up  and just felt that I don't want or &quot;need&quot; to drink
anymore.  Granted I have 1 bottle of tequila hidden but I'm not getting rid of it
just yet because I want to prove that even though it's there, I don't want it.  It's
no different than passing by the liquor store without going in.  I just have a
different state of mind that I can't explain but I think it's connected to the sick
and tired sentiment.  When I woke up yesterday still drunk, followed by a racing
heart beat, sweating then feeling cold and then feeling weird (DTs???) and generally
&quot;sick and tired&quot; yet I didn't feel my usual sadness and guilt and desire to start
drinking again to make everything go away!  I haven't hit rock bottom and don't want
to.
<p>
However, the person who talked me into going to the 1st meeting, (my former
boss) is becoming as persistent as the Jehovah Witnesses that I opened the door to
back in Feb. when I felt sad, but when I explained that I simply am not interested
in their religion in March, they don't bother me anymore but just leave their Watch
Tower newspaper at my door.  I guess, I'll have to explain the same thing to my old
boss.  I felt that these AA people were slaves to their dogma, and I will not be
sold into this mind control &quot;fellowship.&quot;  I really think that some of these people
have good intentions but they trade one addiction for another and that addiction is
AA.
<p>
My father was an alcoholic who quit without AA.  My aunt said he went to a few
meetings but it wasn't for him and I now know why.  He was very intelligent and not
the type to be told what to do.  He ran his own, and very successful, business for
30 years and once he was in his 50's he never had a relapse to return to binge
drinking.  He quit on his own because he was sick and tired of feeling sick and
tired!  Well, that's how I feel and I'm confident that I will do it.

<p>
Just wanted you to know that I find your website very informative and it also speaks
to the way I perceived my brief experience with AA.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Darlene

Hello Darlene,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your suffering, but I'm glad that you are rising above it.

<p>
And yes, of course I agree that you can and will just quit without a mind-control cult telling you what to do.
That is

&quot;Surviving in the wild&quot; is a farce. There are entire species of animals
that have lost the ability to survive in the wild. Should we just kill
them all? Besides, what makes a human's backyard less natural than the
middle of a forest or the side of a lake? What's wrong with being a pet,
as long as the animal is treated well?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Quite right.
<p>
And there is also the issue of adaptability. Some species have shown amazing flexibility
and versatility in adapting to a changed environment. And some have not.
I fear for the Great Spotted Owl. Those things are so fragile that if you stare at one cross-eyed
from ten miles away, it falls out of the tree dead. I'm exaggerating, but only a little bit.
We have to preserve a lot of old growth forest for them to live in (here in Oregon), and they still might not make it.
They don't seem to want to live or nest within 10 miles of a human, and that really restricts their
territory.
<p>
On the other hand, things like rats, cockroaches, Rock Doves (aka &quot;pigeons&quot;), starlings
and sea gulls are indestructable. Nothing will get rid of them. I'm sure that they would all survive
World War III.
<p>
And Canada Geese have made the transition too. A little-known fact is that they nearly went extinct in
the nineteen-fifties from over-hunting. But they seem to have actually changed and adapted, and of
all things, found new homes in city parks.
It seems like they have actually figured out where hunting is allowed, and where it is not, and of course
they prefer to hang out where hunting is illegal. It's as if they know that hunting in city parks is illegal.
Maybe they just learn by observation.
<p>
<a name="geese1"> </a>
Last winter, I made a trip into Portland, and went to visit and feed my geese friends in Waterfront Park.
I was amazed to see large numbers of wild Cackling Geese from Alaska all over the park,
even calmly grazing a mere six or ten
feet away from rushing traffic. And they didn't move when people walked right by them.
I was thinking, &quot;Hey, aren't you little guys supposed to be native to the tundra of Northern Alaska? How did you
get to be so familiar with people and cars and city parks? Have you been hanging out in downtown Anchorage?&quot;

<p>
I don't know how, but they adapted their behavior, and they were using downtown Portland as a safe stop-over during their
migrations. No hunting is allowed in downtown Portland. Harrassing the wildlife is also illegal.
Now how did they figure all of that out?

<p><br>

</center>
<p>
And that is new behavior. I never saw large flocks of Cackling Geese in downtown Portland before.
In previous years, we only had one or two or three Cackling Goose stragglers per year.
Suddenly, a hundred of them are wintering here, and they are as tame as can be. They act like they have
been living in city parks all of their lives.
<p>
It really makes me wonder whether some of the downtown Waterfront Park flock talked to the visiting
Cackling Geese and told them about the safety and convenience of the park.
I wouldn't put it past them. Geese do talk to each other, you know.
I mean, they really talk. They don't just make noises. They say things.
All of the time.

For supposedly wild geese from Northern Alaska, they sure are tame. Neither

<p>
Also, when I was caring for goslings, I was amazed at how
quickly they could adapt to living with a human, and accept a human as their foster
parent. Like after only 12 to 18 hours, they were at home with me. Two days, and we were inseparable.
I don't know of any other bird species that is so adaptable.
The contrast between them and Spotted Owls is unreal.

</font>
<p>
Yeah, the cast would help, but the goose could still peck through it if
it's desperate enough. It definitely would be a good idea to find a
sympathetic vet. Maybe you could check out a few vets and mention your
egg. I would think a vet who would support your efforts would also be
helpful with geese with broken legs.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I'll have to ask around. I'd even like access to an X-ray machine, just to see
whether the bones are aligned right.
<p>
The breaks have all levels of severity. I've nursed a couple of geese
with broken legs back to health
just by feeding them (and leaving them free out in Waterfront Park and just visiting them
and feeding them every day).
Now they didn't have really serious compound breaks or open wounds.
They just had to stay off of the leg for a few weeks or months and it healed.
(And they can swim with just one leg.)
But the ones with open wounds, and bad breaks where the leg is just flopping around,
always died. Those would require capture and a cast and good care, and maybe antibiotics.
And painkillers would be kind.

</font>
<p>
Heh, that sounds amusing. I can understand hunting for food, since a
hunted animal will likely have had a higher quality of life than your
average, factory-farm-raised livestock. (I don't have a problem with
meat-eating in and of itself, but our meat industry could do with some
reform.) Hunting just for a trophy, on the other hand, is a little
disturbing. As for how a human should be cooked for best taste, I vote
fried. Everything tastes better fried.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yup.
</font>
<p>
No kidding. Reminds me a bit of how poor white people used to hate black
slaves, which only benefited the rich white people. Hell, racism from
poor white people still benefits rich people today. If the plebeians are
fighting each other, they won't fight you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Divide and conquer.
</font>
<p>
The junk food diet certainly didn't do me any good. I didn't eat enough,
I felt sick all of the time, and my blood pressure dropped low enough
that I had trouble standing up without going into orthostatic hypotension.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ouch!
</font>
<p>
I would very much love to hear an explanation for editing what's
supposed to be the word of God. Although even mainstream Christianity's
hands are not clean in that regard.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Quite correct.
<p>
Do you remember the short-lived TV series called &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;? (About 20 or 22 years ago.)
It was a comedy that used dinosaurs as its characters.
In one episode, the starring family's child was declared to be the new Holy Messiah
by the local religion. The High Priest read the Scriptures, &quot;The mother will be beautiful and pure, and the father will be
brave and noble and wise.&quot; After hearing the child's father speak, the Priest said,
&quot;Get the white-out.&quot; Then he wrote in the Scriptures, &quot;And the father will be a blithering idiot.&quot;
<p>
Ah yes, the fate of many a &quot;holy book&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Yeah, not smelling rotten egg is a very good sign. Rabbits are kind of
the same way about body heat. I used to raise rabbits, and it took my
does a litter or so to figure out that the kits needed to stay warm to
live. Single kits also have trouble staying alive because it doesn't
have siblings to huddle with.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hmm, interesting. Fortunately, single goslings don't have it so bad.
Now they may miss having a bunch of siblings to hang out with, but it isn't essential. Then again,
they might not miss siblings.  Having a loving parent to cuddle with is what is essential.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
very well thought and correct for as far as I can tell, you give no alternatives
besides a therapist. most people who attend those meetings have neither insurance or
60-100hr for therapy. I have found only one alternative (which I am attending first
meeting tonight is an hour away from my house) smartrecovery. I know nothing about
it other than what they posted online.  you seemed to have done your homework on why
AA sucks, have you also done such for available alternatives? if so, please share
with me so I can pass on the info as well.

thanks,

Hello Brian,
<p>
Thank you for the question, and thanks for the compliments.
I don't know what you were reading, but I'm not very enthusiastic about 
therapists. I sure do not recommend them as the best treatment, or the first choice.
More like as a last resort. (Perhaps because my own experiences with therapists and counselors led
me to believe that most of them are incompetent.)

Agent Orange,

<p>
You have shown your true colors. I called you out on your lack of logic,
pervasive bias against AA and paranoid theories about organized medicine.
You don't have an adequate reply to those accusations because they are apt.

<p>
I could tell that you were a crank from your homepage:
<p>
<blockquote>

*THE ORANGE PAPERS (Where are the papers? This appears to be a website. Is
it like the Pentagon papers? If it says papers a bunch of experts in
addiction must have written it...)*
<p>
One Man's (redundant &#8212;  there is one author named) Analysis (analysis
implies objectivity) of Alcoholics Anonymous and Substance Misuse Recovery
Programs, and Real Recovery (redundant &#8212;  recovery is recovery).
<p>
An Online Book (no such thing &#8212;  you want the credit of being an author
without the process of publishing.)
<p>
by &quot;Orange&quot; (Why do you need quotation marks here? Mark Twain's name
doesn't appear in quotation marks on the cover of Huckleberry Finn. Why do
you need a pseudonym? Most medical research is published under the author's
actual name.)
<p>
The whole effect you are going for is of that of a brave and virtuous
researcher taking on the bad guys at the evil AA headquarters. Aren't you
always talking about how cults use language to distort reality? Isn't it
dishonest to call your website a book?
</blockquote>

<p>
You are giving medically unsound advice to people. You are encouraging them
to &quot;go it alone&quot; regardless of what treatment they may need. You are
telling them that speaking to a therapist about their history is tantamount
to a Buchmanite confession.

<p>
Please consider what the ramifications are for your readers. AAs are
dismissive of psychiatric drugs and other therapies. I am starting to think
that you share that same illogical attitude.

<p>
Andrew

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again Andrew,
<p>
I have thought long and hard about the ramifications of my advice to others, and also about
the ramifications of Alcoholics Anonymous pushing an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties as
a cure for alcohol addiction.

<p>
While no one has a sure-fire easy never-fails answer, Alcoholics Anonymous has one of the worst track
records in the world, with
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the highest death rate</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">the highest relapse rate and binge drinking rate</a>.
This has been observed, measured, and documented repeatedly, and by real medical doctors, too.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters306.html#Brian_G" target="_blank">The things that I recommend</a>
have much higher success rates. And that is the bottom line, isn't it?
Does a method or treatment or therapy cure more people, or kill more people?
<p>
And I certainly do not tell people to avoid medications when they need them.
<p>
So, do you recommend foisting
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>
on sick people,
and lying to them, and telling them that it works great when it doesn't?
Why don't you think about the ramifications of that for a while?
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Steve E.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA and such.<br>

<p>
Agent Orange,

<p>
After reading your out-patient experience, I can only say mine was
word-for-word what you went through. What pisses me off the most is the
M.D. running the program kicked me out after 90 days sober, two sessions
before the end of the whole thing. The reason? I didn't attend enough AA
meetings, which is true because I was holding down a full-time job and
trying to be a father to two great kids.

<p>
Anyway, this Dr. screamed 12-steps from high heaven. He also billed me for
consultations that never happened, but that's another story. During one
brief meeting I did tell him I thought my issues stemmed from some
childhood abuse, and the binging came on during high stress periods. He
didn't want to hear my story, basically saying every drunk wants to be
unique (terminal uniqueness).

<p>
Flash forward a few years and I find the same doctor consulting for a
non-12-step rehab called The Exclusive in Hawaii. It seems their model is
to try to find the underlying issues for one' self destruction. I did a
little research and found this doctor is still with Pacific Coast Recovery,
still pushing 12-steps, but on the side working for the high-end rehab in
Hawaii. You can find him online. His name is Dr. Daniel Headrick. He, like
Dr. Drew, is a general practitioner who chose to work in one area that
requires little extra schooling and has hardly no oversight: addiction
specialist.

<p>
The whole nonsense of it all has created a lot of anger in me, but that
anger seems to keep me from going off the deep end. I do find that you
seemingly deliver your thoughts and information without much anger. For
that I congratulate you.

<p>
Keep up the good work. The attacks will obviously continue, but one fact
remains: the rehab industry claim addiction is a disease, but the #1 method
they prescribe to treat it is a spiritual cure. It's time for more people
to scream and shout about these contradictions and M.D.'s like Dr. Headrick
who see no problem in the way they're treating people.

<p>
Best of luck,

<p>
Steve E&gt;

Hello Steve,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. And congratulations on your sobriety.
I'm sorry to hear about the garbage that you had to go through.
There is just so much of that quackery going around, isn't there?
<p>
Well, hopefully, when we continue to shine the spotlight of publicity on the fraud that is called 12-Step
treatment, we can change the situation. It's certainly worth a try.
<p>
And I think we will succeed, and are already succeeding in part. I was just speaking with a candidate
for the state legislature here about such quackery and bad treatment wasting precious state money (like pulling
dollars out of the Oregon Health Plan),
and he commented that one of the highest-ranking state officials (whose name I won't print here for now)
is an ex-alcoholic with 18 years sober,
and one of his pet causes is better treatment programs for alcoholics.
Apparently he has seen the hoax too.
So there is hope, and reason to believe that we will make progress.
The truth will out.

<p>
Have a good day now.
