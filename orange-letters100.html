Hi, Orange,
<p>
being a Hungarian my English is quite okay (a lot better than your
Hungarian might be) though not perfect, sorry.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi, Lidia,
<br>
Yes, your English is much, much better than my Hungarian. :-)
</font>
<p>
It's soooo good to have found your website! I'll  try and won't repeat
all that's been written before by all the ex-AAs like myself, but it's
relieving to see how many of us are and also how similar our experiences
are. I think we must be sane, after all.

<p>
In short: I've been sober for 10 years and AA-free for more than 7 years.

<p>
One blessed day 10 years ago I decided not to drink any longer as I was
fed up with being drunk most of the time and it's only after that that I
went to my first meeting. But being in a rather miserable condition both
mentally and physically, I sort of needed (or thought I needed) AA as
some walking stick or crutches or whatever. And even looking back I do
not feel ashamed for having been duped &#8212; it seems that this was just a
phase in my life and I'm happy I was able to leave it behind.

<p>
After more or less a year or so in AA I began to feel sort of awkward
but than I thought I was being just ungrateful... or pretending to be too
clever... or looking down on other people... or just &quot;an insane
alcoholic&quot;. It took me more than two years to admit that I SIMPLY DON'T
WANT TO GO THERE. I SIMPLY DON'T FEEL WELL THERE. I didn't kinda dare to
think of AA as a cult, I did not think of anything at all, as far as I
remember, I did not want to hurt  anybody, I simply had that instinctive
feeling of RUNNING AWAY AND STAYING AWAY.

<p>
Much of what I've read here in the letters I have experienced too, but I
also remember that rather weird process of having to ask somebody to be
my sponsor.  I could not think of any of the members as my sponsor but
then the pressure was so hard... I chose somebody. Fortunately she was
not too pushy and we did not speak too often. It was a lot worse with
those who asked me to be their spsonsor. And as &quot;we never say no in AA&quot;
(another crystal clear attribute of a sect member), I became the
&quot;sponsor&quot; or rather victim of a host of energy vampires and weirdos and
loonies.
<p>
I made it to AA and I made it out of AA, and my life is managable, and
not drinking alcohol is absolutely natural and easy for me  &#8212; and it is
great to read your writings and also all those letters.
<p>
Thank you for your work and I only hope that  this site will reach all
those who would like it to reach them.
<p>
Have a good day,
<p>
Lidia

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thank you for the letter. I'm glad to hear that your life is better now.
And congratulations on your years of sobriety. Life really is more fun when
you don't wake up hung-over all of the time, isn't it?

So have a good day, and a good life.

Subject:  	Your AA, My AA<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,
<p>
I've spent a couple of days now poring through your Web site, digesting various
essays and criticisms of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
I want to give you and your readers a message from this current &quot;practicing&quot; member
of AA: Right-the-fuck on!
<p>
I appreciate and admire anyone who has the courage to pursue truth, and obviously
your passions have been well-focused on what you perceive as the injustices,
hypocrisy and outright dangers of AA. And I say all this as a person who attends AA
daily.
<p>
After being more or less a good, hearty drunk schlub for 11 years, I entered an
AA-centered rehab center last October, and I've been attending AA ever since, quite
voluntarily.
<p>
Since I am an atheist, I had &#8212; er, HAVE &#8212; grave misgivings about such a &quot;spiritual&quot;
program. I was initially comforted by people who said that my &quot;higher power&quot; is one
of my own choosing, and so I chose &quot;the universe,&quot; as I am intrigued by quantum
theory and the ideas of Stephen Hawking and modern cosmologists. However, it soon
became clear that this was looked down upon. I wasn't &quot;with the program.&quot; One AAer
told me I had to read the chapter &quot;We Agnostics&quot; every day for 60 days, and then I
would &quot;get it.&quot;
<p>
That struck me as hilarious, insulting and painfully disingenuous. In other words,
he said I was too stupid and unenlightened and had never developed my own thinking
on the matter, and that only by a daily routine of mindless repetition would I then
develop a belief in God. I secretly thought to myself, well, if that were the case,
then taking a shit would have become my religion a long time ago.
<p>
Many of your other myriad criticisms seem spot-on to me as well, though I've only
been attending AA for three months. I have no doubt that in time more will become
evident.
<p>
I thought long and hard about AA in my life in light of your Web site, and for now,
I'm going to continue going.
<p>
One of AA's favorite slogans, as you know, is &quot;keep it simple.&quot; In some respects &#8212; 
probably not in the sense they mean &#8212; that is good advice.
<p>
There are three reasons that I will continue attending AA, at least for the
immediate future:

<p>
1.  I think I need to hear drunk stories right now, to know that my problems are
not unique, and that people can and have gotten past their worst periods of life.
There is more than a modicum of camaraderie in my AA meetings. Individuals in the
group are genuinely supportive as well.
<p>
2.  If the American dollar continues to plummet, those AA chips might make for a
good black market currency.
<p>
3.  The tits on the chick in the back row.

<p>
Thanks for your Web site. Don't be afraid of the truth, brother. And best fortunes
in your sobriety.
<p>

From:  	&quot;Jason S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	aa issues ...<br>

<p>
Hi. My name is Jason and I am currently sober for ten months now. I went through a
residential drug/alcohol rehab last January. When I returned home I was in an
outpatient program from that rehab and I did the whole 90/90 deal, got a sponsor,
started being of service as a secretary at a morning meeting, went to AA &amp; NA and I
was okay with all of it for awhile.
<p>
That is until, I really started getting some
time around that whole scene. There were little things that just didn't quite jive
with me, but I rolled along because after all ... &quot;my way didn't work in the past&quot;
... &quot;time to try somebody else's way for a change.&quot; Sure. What the hell? I mean what
do I have to lose? Except maybe my sanity.
<p>
That's right. When I was drinking and
using I did some crazy things without a doubt, but it is at this point in my life
that I feel closer to insanity than I ever have. I don't think I am insane, but I go
nuts trying to make sense of some of the AA horse shit that
gets shoveled down my throat.
<p>
Anyway, I am just wondering if you respond to folks
like myself who are having issues with AA/NA. I found your essays and although I
feel that you go a little overboard with some of your material, it was so
refreshing to learn that there was someone else out there that has gone through
what I feel I am going through at the moment. You hit on so many of the exact
issues that I am troubled with. I just wondered if you might be up for talking with
me sometime or writing ... whatever. I really need someone in my position to talk
with. I cant talk to AA people because they tell me ... &quot;you're in your head!&quot; ...
to which I reply ...&quot;No shit. It's my head. I'm already in it. It's only me in my
head.&quot; or they tell me that I am not turning my life over to God, or that I am
hiding something ... my first sponsor told me that once. I tell him that I've kinda
been down lately and I just can't figure out why ... just one of those days
you know? And he says ...&quot;you're not turning your life over to God. This program
requires rigorous honesty. You're lying and not being truly honest.&quot;
<p>
What the hell
does that even mean? I haven't had to work for this whole year, which is what I
intended to do when I got out of rehab. I had the money and I used it and I am glad
that I did. So here it is, I have a little money in my pocket, I have my house, a
car, my family and this guy tells me that I HAVE to get a job and he puts me on a
schedule in which to find one. I pretty much decide that I don't really need to
work right now so why should I if I don't have to and I don't want to? My family is
fed, the bills are paid and I am working on getting my life back together. That
sounded good to me, but he tells me ...&quot;you hide behind  your money and that
attitude is going to get you drunk again. You live this pretend and frankly, silly
lifestyle when you should be out there working and earning a paycheck
instead of holding your family hostage while you spend your savings. You're not
being honest with me about your money.&quot; He was pissed off at me because I wouldn't
let him see my financial records. I'm sorry man, but, there isn't a bone in my body
that tells me &quot;YES JASON. LET THIS TOTAL STRANGER WHO WAS A COCAINE ADDICT AND
ALCOHOLIC LIKE YOU SEE ALL OF YOUR ASSETS, STOCKS, PROPERTY, AND CASH ACCOUNTS.&quot;
That's where my &quot;willingness&quot; began to wane.

<p>
Anyway, hey, I am starting to ramble. If you would like to talk or write to me or
even hook me up with some folks who would ... I would surely be grateful for your
help.

<p>
Thanks,<br>
truly,<br>
Jason S.

From:  	&quot;anonymous&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Thank you, Thank you! Enlightened ex-AA here to say Thank you!<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
I just want to thank you for your website.  It's a breath of fresh air for
those of us more thoughtful, independent types who have tried AA for years (7 for
me) and
have found it cultish, archaic, and downright creepy, yet also found it
difficult to abandon the well ingrained brainwashing we received from 'the
program&quot;.  It's nice to know I'm not alone in struggling with this,
and it's really good to confirm my suspicions and gut instincts that screamed
at me, telling me AA is a dysfunctional, human spirit killing, thought killing
cult.

<p>
I'm embarrassed to tell you I have a degree in one of the physical sciences,
worked in R&amp;D for a major company, have published patents, yet I still
allowed myself to be sucked into a cult where independent, scientific thinking
is a big no-no.  Hell, I love to analyze and think, and after years in AA
I was starting to lose this ability, well, maybe not lose it, but the AA dogma
was conflicting bigtime with my ability to trust and believe in myself, and I
was going more crazy and becoming incredibly depressed, and of course blaming
it all on myself, after all, it's never the fault of &quot;the infallible
program&quot;.  I started to become like the computer Hal from the movie
<i>2001, A Space Odyssey</i>.  Remember why he went crazy?  Because he was
getting conflicting messages, the astronauts were telling him things about the
mission he knew weren't true, they just didn't compute with his circuits.
Likewise with myself, the more nonsense I heard in meetings and the big book,
much of which contradicts its own self, the more my instincts cried out this is
wrong!  I finally did some real research into AA, and while it took
awhile, I'm finally AA free and not guilty about it!  I'm just upset with
myself that it took this long.

<p>
Again I want to commend you on your site.  Many anti-AA sites out there
tell of the horrors of AA, but then proceed to bash AA and God and religion as
if they're all in the same category, it's more emotional venom than sound
reasons why AA is dangerous.  Your scientific approach is much more
credible.  Your research into the history of AA, especially the Oxford
groups, Bill W's madness before and after sobriety, AA's actual efficacy
(5%-wow) and the psychology behind the steps is enlightening to say the least,
and I'm glad someone has the guts to put it out there.

<p>
Two final thoughts.  First, I'm not a rabid atheist.  I believe in
God, and one of the greatest things I've read on the difference between AA's
God and my God was from Ken Ragge's &quot;More Revealed&quot;, which basically
says God gave me my life and my will as a gift.  Why would I turn over my
personality, thoughts and identity to AA's God, i.e. &quot;the program&quot;, this
would be disgracing what God gave me.  Secondly, I love reading the mail
you get from AA folk.  Isn't it ironic how so much of it is filled with bitter,
hateful attacks on you, from supposedly such spiritual people?
Haven't these people read pg. 66 of the big book?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;If we were to
live we had to be free of anger.  The grouch and the brainstorm were not
for us.  They may be the dubious luxury of normal men, but for alcoholics
these things are poison&quot;.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I guess these guys aren't working the
program and are heading for a relapse, they better get back to suppressing
their emotions!

<p>
Take care Orange, I'm glad you're
out there.

Hello again orange, I just sent you a lengthy e-mail, and I just thought of one
other thing I wanted to send to you.  I read this about a year ago, and it's
sickening.  Here's the link:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322003504/http://home.earthlink.net/~insure/SponservsTherapist.html">

<p>
No wonder so many people with real emotional or psychological problems, or those
just completely beat up by booze and who have already lost most of their self
esteem, self worth, and identity are damaged even more by AA.  This sums up AA's
authoritative, barbaric attitude, and they think this is healthy stuff.  This says
to me &quot;your shit, now do what we say, who the hell do you think you are, looking out
for yourself or trying to better yourself, we know what's best for you, not you!&quot;  I
had bad flashbacks reading this again, this is exactly how AA is.

<h2>12 Ways to Tell the Difference Between Your Sponsor and Your Therapist:</h2>
</center>

<p>
1. Your sponsor isn't all that interested in the &quot;reasons&quot; you drank.

<p>
2. Your therapist thinks your root problem is your lack of self-esteem
and your negative self-image. Your sponsor thinks your problem is
yourself.

<p>
3. Your therapist wants to pamper your inner child. Your sponsor thinks it  should
be spanked.

<p>
4. Your sponsor thinks your inventory should be about you, not your parents.

<p>
5. Speaking of your parents, your sponsor tells you not to confront them,  but to
make amends to them.

<p>
6. The only time your sponsor uses the word &quot;closure&quot; is before the word  &quot;mouth.&quot;

<p>
7. Your sponsor thinks &quot;boundaries&quot; are things you need to take down, not  build up.

<p>
8. Your therapist wants you to love yourself first;  your sponsor wants you  to
love others first.

<p>
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
9. Your therapist prescribes care-taking medication.  Your sponsor prescribes
prayer making and meditation.

<p>
10. Your sponsor thinks &quot;anger management skills&quot; are numbered 1 through 12.

<p>
11. Now that you haven't had a drink in 6 months, your therapist thinks
you should make a list of all your goals and objectives for the next 5
years, starting with finishing up that college degree. Your sponsor
thinks you should start today by cleaning coffee pots and help to carry
a heavy box of literature to the jail.

<p>
12. Your sponsor will not lose his/her license if  he/she talks about God.

Hello, anonymous,
<p>
Thanks for the letters, and thanks for the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are feeling saner.
<p>
The document that you just sent is quite the gem, isn't it?
I also found it on the web site of the Northern Illinois Area Service Newsletter, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#NIAAA">I used it as an example of the insanity of A.A. and its dogmatic attitudes</a>.
The sneering condescension towards anybody who doesn't devote their lives to A.A.
and become a true believer in the 12-Step religion is really something else.
And the blatant interference in medical treatment in item 9, the A.A. &quot;no-medications&quot; doctrine,
is criminal malpractice and practicing medicine without a license.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

The following three letters from Jaune came together in short order before I answered the first one,
so they are not a back-and-forth conversation.

Subject:  	A.A<br>

<p>
I have read all of your information and from what i can tell you, you have done your
research on A.A. And while some of it may be true, it sounds like most of it is
opinion. YOUR OPINION. And while you have the right to your opinion I have the right
to mine so here it is,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, Jaune,
<p>
Thanks for the letters.
<p>
I have little regard for opinions, because everybody's got one, and at least half
of them are misinformed and wrong, and at odds with the facts.
I collect facts, like the results of carefully-controlled medical studies, because those
are about the only things that you can trust. 
</font>

<p>
First of all A.A. may not be for everyone but your numbers are
ridiculious. For the people it has and will work for, including me, it is the only
way that has worked.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists. You are also engaging in
a word game &quot;it works for those for whom it worked.&quot; That is a meaningless statement.
You could just as easily have declared, &quot;It didn't work for all of the people for whom it didn't work.&quot;
<p>
Since you regard my numbers as ridiculous, let's see your numbers. What kind of cherry-picked clients
start your treatment, and what is the success rate?
<p>
And please list the success rate with ALL clients, not just the &quot;graduates&quot;.
<p>
In addition, what kind of follow-ups do you do? What is the long-term sobriety rate of your clients,
like for 5 or 10 years, that results from your treatment?
Or do you do any such follow-ups?
<p>
If you don't do follow-ups, then you don't really know whether your treatment works over the long haul.
<p>
And above all, the only really valid test of treatment is a randomized longitudinal controlled study.
Has your clinic ever performed such a test of your treatment program?

</font>
<p>
As a counselor, i have not seen one person remain sober after
treatment without the twelve steps. That is not one person in the 6 years i have
been doing this job.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, your observations are biased and limited. Do you actually have any lists of people who
got themselves sober without the 12 Steps? I didn't think so. You only see your own clients.
<p>
Did you actually do any follow-ups to see
whether the people who didn't use the 12 Steps got sober later? Did you see whether the people
who did it with the 12 Steps stayed sober?  And what was your over-all success rate?
How many were treated, and how many got a year of sobriety?
Five years? Ten years?
</font>
<p>
It is also my opinion that the people who diss A.A like you and
so many others have, actually have a problem themselves and they are not willing to
do the work or what it takes to get and remain sober.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. I have 8 years of sobriety now. And getting and staying sober is actually quite simple:
Just don't drink any more alcohol.  Sobriety does not require joining a cult religion.
</font>
<p>

Also, the people who tend to
diss A.A. and Treatment alike have issues with denial and it is easier to down or
demean something that will attempt to pull them out of denial or tell the truth,
Remember, this is 10 years of sobriety, 3 degrees, and six years as a counselor
talking.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are generalizing. &quot;Denial&quot; about what?  And don't you declare that the drinking
people are &quot;in denial&quot;, and the ones who are not drinking are &quot;not in denial&quot;.
Thus, &quot;denial&quot; is just a euphemism for drinking or refusing to practice the 12-Step religion.

</font>
<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
Look something up that should have been in your research, the Diagnostic
Statististical Manuel and The Addiciton Studies of American Medicine defines
addiction/ alcoholism as a symptom of a deeper issue rather it be unresolved
resentment and issues, personality / cognitive behavior disorders and that
alcoholism/ addiction is a way of avoiding issues or feelings. Alcoholism/ Addiction
is a powerful thing it causes alot of hurt for the person and their family.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, <i><b>you</b></i> should look it up in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
 There is no such disease as &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
The DSM-IV lists &quot;alcohol dependence&quot; and &quot;alcohol abuse&quot;,
 but no &quot;alcoholism&quot;.  And they certainly don't list a
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;spiritual disease which only a spiritual experience will conquer&quot;</font>,
like Bill Wilson said. And they don't list anything that requires
treatment with the 12 Steps of <a href="orange-rroot090.html">Frank Buchman's religion</a>.
<p>
Here is the page of the DSM-IV that lists the alcohol-related mental disorders:

</center>
<p>
There is no &quot;alcoholism&quot; listed. The American Psychiatric Association
 refuses to even use that word.

</font>
<p>
It is
also very simple yet so complicated; people will go out of their way to avoid their
feelings, resentments, and problems to such an extent as to demaan others and their
solutions if it appears to hard or real for them including spending all this time
researching something to find any little thing that would justify as to why not to
do something that may be the solution.

<p>
<font color="blue">
While some people may deny their feelings, that in no way means that they
 should join a cult religion.  That just makes matters worse. And that
 is what A.A. does to people &#8212; makes them worse.

Subject:  	a little more information and food for thought<br>

<p>
I do agree that there have been and are some people in A.A who act a little cultish
or what i call the A.A. Muffins, the fact is that  they have been sober for an
extended period of time and that there way of thinking has worked for them, and
thats great. Just because i dissagree with some of the people and society in
general, does not prevent me for doing what is right for me, the fact is that my
program is mine, i get help from the people in A.A. who speak to me, internally and
for those who are  distasteful and push A.A.; they do not determine the outcome of
my sobriety. Sponsorship is a wonderful thing but it has to be from two people who
are alike and agree with each and even speak to each other on a internal level.
There are those whose narcisstic ways demean and ruin the meaning of A.A. and push
people away when they are vulnerable; i have seen that. One has to remember, if a
person who really wants help needs to be willing to try anything and everything to
remain sober.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a standard cult demand: &quot;You must be willing to try anything.&quot;
Baloney. That is mental suicide.
That is drinking the koolaid.
</font>
<p>

As a counselor, and like many other counselors that i know, if  people
are unwilling to try everything including A.A then statistics prove that they will
not, unfortunately, remain sober.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Prove it. That is an outrageous statement, so prove it. I want to see some good, valid, medical
studies that show that people who won't practice the A.A. cult religion don't get sober.
In your first letter, you started off criticizing me for expressing opionions, and now you
are expressing a grossly untrue biased opinion. So let's see a medical study.
<p>
The facts are that A.A. has been tested in medical tests, and the results were:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness, and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, the A.A. Trustee,
found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective, and raised the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ol>

</font>
<p>

And one also has to remember that not all people
in A.A represent the feelings and sentements of all the people in A.A. And while
their are people who would benefit from A.A are turned off by some idiots in A.A. it
does not mean that they should give up. After all, if A.A was not the solution for
some people it would not have stayed and grown stronger since 1935.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. A.A. is a solution just like how Scientology and the Moonies are a solution.
Just ask Tom Cruise whether Scientology restored him to sanity.
Scientology has grown even faster than A.A., so Scientology must be really good, by your logic, right?
Even better than Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Oh, and Scientology claims to have a wonderful drug and alcohol treatment program called
Narconon, which is based on the teachings of the Scientology founder
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard (who was even more insane
than Bill Wilson).  But hey! Scientology has grown very fast since 1956, and it has branch offices
in every city, and it has lots of celebrity members. So it must be good, just like Alcoholics Anonymous, right?
</font>
<p>

It is also my
opinion that fear is a powerful feeling and to some, sobriety is a scary thing.
<p>
<font color="blue">
There is nothing scary about sobriety. That's just another mindless A.A. slogan.
It's wonderful to wake up healthy, without a hang-over.
Sobriety is not scary.
<p>
Now there is a thought that scares alcoholics &#8212; it's the thought that they will never have any
more fun for the rest of their lives. But that isn't fear of sobriety. That is fear of losing
all of the joy in life.
 But that is just a mistaken thought. Sobriety is not the end of fun. For me, it was the start of lots
 more fun.
</font>
<p>
Fear
can either help you if it is harnested right or it can hurt you if it is used as a
shield or isolater. Fear can determine what a person does and what they do not do
and sometimes fear is also used as a defense or excuse not to see the solution in
all things. It is easier to be fearful and discontent rather than grateful, content,
and proactive.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is all just psycho-babble.  That has nothing to do with why people should join a cult
religion like Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

Please understand that i am not disagreeing with you because you do
bring some valid arguements. But their are two sides to every arguement and an
arguement does not sound valid and convincing without both sides being heard.. Its
called a Rogerian Arguement..
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is the propagaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape Via Relativism</a>&quot;.
As in,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just your opinion versus my opinion, and one opinion is just as good as another.
There are two sides to every argument.&quot;
</font>
Wrong. FACTS are what matters, not opinions.

What Does Positive Mean, Anyway?

<p>
Lazarus raises an important question? What is
positive? For example, in the realm of affect is positive
an emotion that feels good or one that is functional?
Or is positive an emotion that the person
values and believes is appropriate? The questions
about what is positive raise many interesting issues.
For example, to what degree are the pleasant emotions
also those that are most functional, and are
the emotions the person values the most functional
for him or her? Clearly, there are probably many instances
in which the varying definitions of positive
emotions point to different emotions as being positive
in particular contexts. In our work on norms
for emotions, for example, we find that individuals
differ in terms of which emotions they value?and
it is not always pleasant emotions. For instance, we
find that certain cultural groups such as the Chinese
do not value pride, which is highly valued by
Americans (e.g., see Eid &amp; Diener, 2001) and is experienced
as pleasant by them. We also find that
people differ in whether a fun and enjoyable day is
considered to be most satisfying. Asian Americans,
for example, are less likely than European Americans
to say that an enjoyable day was satisfying &#8212; 
they more highly value days with high achievement,
whereas European-American students tend to
find fun days to be more satisfying. Thus, we see
differences in whether individuals are satisfied with
affective experiences that are enjoyable versus with
other values that might be esteemed more than
pleasant emotions. Different definitions of positive
in this instance lead to different satisfaction judgments.
Rather than being cause for despair that we,
as researchers, can never definitively define positive
to everyone's satisfaction, I see different approaches
to defining positive and their relation to
each other as very interesting avenues for intellectual
exploration. Perhaps we will even discover
principles that unite the various types of positive.
Positive psychologists must explore the basis of
what is positive. We (Diener &amp; Suh, 1997) borrowed
from the philosopher Brock (1993) to suggest that
there are three bases by which people judge what is
good or valuable:
<p>
1. People's choices are one indicant of what is
good, and this is used in economics. If people consistently
choose something, they must think it is good.
<p>
2. We also use people's judgments and experiences
of pleasantness as an indicant of what is good, such as
feelings of subjective well-being. If people feel satisfied
with an outcome and pleased with achieving it,
they must believe it is positive.
<p>
3. Finally,we use value systems based on norms, religious
beliefs, and so forth to judge what is positive. For
instance, we believe that torture is bad and curing most
illness is good, based on our values. Our values tell us
that some things are right or wrong, regardless of the
other two definitions of what is good. For example, we
believe that slavery was wrong, regardless of whether
the slaves might have been happy and regardless of
whether some individuals might have chosen to continue
to be slaves.
<p>
Each of the three approaches to defining the good
or positive points us toward some of the things that are
positive; at times the three will agree and at times they
will not. Economists use people's choices in the market
economy as a judgment of what is good; there are
clear shortcomings to this approach. Psychologists are
apt to use subjective well-being as a major criterion of
the good life, but there are clear limitations to this approach,
too, if it is used to the exclusion of other definitions.
<p>
For example, perhaps Hitler or Ghengis Khan
were happy, but this would not lead us to conclude that
their lives were good. The third approach, based on
values, suggests that some emotions are good because
we value them, or because we value the outcomes they
cause. For example, they might help us achieve our
goals. Once again, however, there are limitations to the
value approach. For example, individuals may disagree
about values and there are cross-cultural differences in
people?s values, as well. Furthermore, we tend to distrust
most value statements when they continually
seem to contradict people's choices, and we are skeptical
of value systems that lead to long-term unhappiness
for most people. Thus, &quot;positive emotions&quot; might
be positive or negative, depending on the particular
criteria used, and on the situation. Positive does not
have to be a simple, monadic concept to be a useful
heuristic one. The positive in positive psychology
merely points to broad areas in need of study; once
working in an area, however, the basis of positive
functioning has to be carefully analyzed.
<p>
Rather than making positive psychology impossible,
the three different approaches to defining positive
make psychologists' task more intriguing. In addition,
the alternative to searching for what is positive is to re-

Well, that's sort of interesting, but it really just degenerates into a discussion of semantics

I'll just make a few basic statements in response:

<li> GOOD treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction reduces the use of those chemicals by the clients, preferably
permanently.
<p>
<li> BAD treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction either fails to reduce usage, or
actually increases the use of those chemicals.
<p>
<li> BAD treatment for alcoholism or drug addiction also increases the death rate, the rate of
binge drinking, the rate of rearrests, the divorce rate, the suicide rate, and the babbling of
irrational cult religion slogans.

How's that for a value system?

From:  	Pete L.<br>
Subject:  	A prime example<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
The Bainbridge Island group (WA) is prime example of everything you talk about
in your [website].  The sexual exploitation of minors was rife in that group in the form
of the pairing of underage girls with older males with time/guru status.
People were well aware of this fact and did nothing about it.
<p>
 What I wish to
mention is this doctor who was a mainstay of that group for awhile, for he
underscores the extent cult-religion has infiltrated the medical profession.. He once
had 'time' in the program and had relapsed and had lost his license. When I
knew him he was really doing it &#8212; 'working' the steps, going to meetings everyday,
and sharing like he really knew his stuff. He finally got his license back
because he did all the necessary stepcraft, and proceeded to take some
anesthesia and slit his aorta, causing instant death. This, of course, really upset
the group as he was such a shining example of someone who 'worked the program.'
<p>
Why is someone in the medical profession forced to endure cult-religion
to receive his license?   I once asked him what he thought about cannabis, for
at the time I was smoking herb and going to meetings as that was the only way
I could endure the mendacity of AA, and I had yet to find your web site and I
still thought I needed 'the program' to get off booze, and he parroted the
following party line: 'For me, cannabis and alcohol are one and the same.'
<p>
I don't toke today for the simple reason that my job does not permit it, but if the
time and place occurred I would  partake of the wicked weed, and the question
remains of the good doctor: Who is alive today after all that AA about not
smoking weed?
<p>
This further brings up the topic of Anti-depressants. When I was in
detox in Everett I was kicked out with a bad case of D.T.'s because I brought
up the topic of prescriptions in group. The counselor was running the meeting,
although he called it AA, and I mentioned how Zoloft had a molecular
structure almost identical to LSD. Then I made the cardinal sin of reminding him of
how Bill Wilson indulged in LSD, a whole chapter of which is written about this
in AA's own literature <i>Pass It On</i>. He said 'You're wrong' about Zoloft, and that
when he had young boys in his youth group who were depressed he took them
out in the woods. I struggled at the edge of me seat not to  snipe at him that
'Yea, you look like the kind of guy who likes to take young boys out in the
woods', but I did tell him to look it up about Zoloft and prove that I was wrong.
He said most assuredly that he would, and when he came back told me I had to
leave this detox center, funded by you and me &#8212; the tax payer, instead of
telling us his findings.
<p>
These two-bit faith healers think they know better than
doctors,  and it is a great danger to our health care. I personally suffered
from the illegal dispensing of prescription medical advice in AA, especially in
the Bainbridge Group, and endured a great deal of agony in Sundown Treatment
center in Yakima because of this attitude. I talk about this in my blog at Yahoo
360 Joe Hill. The only thing I think that would stop them is a class action
lawsuit, and I wonder why the ACLU has allowed stepists so much latitude?
Stepism has gone way too far in my life and the world in general and I applaud your
efforts. It needs to be stopped before it costs any more lives.
<p>
Later, Pete L.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Pete,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story. I hope you are feeling better now.
<p>
And yes, we need to stop those quacks. One of the best ways to do it is
to cut off their supply of money.
And an ACLU class action lawsuit sounds good too. Why hasn't somebody
sued treatment centers for fraud?

<p>
So have a good day.

We all have a right to our opinion, no matter how screwed up it is..... Bottom line a
LOT of peoples lives have changed for the better because of AA and Bill Wilson.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Wayne,
<p>
Now that's the whole problem, isn't it? How many people's lives have been changed for
the better by Alcoholics Anonymous, and how many were changed for the worse?
<p>
Sure, you have a right to your opinion. But what is an unrealistic opinion worth?
<p>
Pointing to some people in a room who claim to be sober, and declaring that the
practices of a goofy old
cult religion from the nineteen-thirties made them get sober
does not provide reliable evidence of success.
<p>
All of the reliable studies and tests have shown that A.A. hurts more people than it helps.
Once again:
<p>

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking, and

<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a

<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, the A.A. Trustee,
found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective, and raised the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ol>

<p>
Actually, a lot of that is to be expected when insane people and unreformed criminals
are used as sponsors and mentors and counselors and spiritual advisors and quack doctors.
You can easily end up with groups that exist solely to
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">supply under-age girls to the old sponsors</a>,

<p>
Mr. Orange

<p>
What are you trying to prove and for what purpose.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Martin,
<p>
I'm trying to get the truth out.
</font>
<p>
Have you or someone you know been hurt by AA ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Lots of people that I know of have been hurt by Alcoholics Anonymous. Just read the letters
that I have received.
</font>
<p>
I'm 3 years without a drink, enjoy going to meetings and it's my way of  life.
It's a hell of a lot better than my life when I was a raging alcoholic  drunk.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your three years of sobriety. And yes, sobriety is better than killing yourself
with alcohol.
</font>
<p>
I'm college educated, Masters degree, and I get exactly what I need out of
the program.
I tried for many years to stop drinking but this works for me.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I challenge that. You are assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists.
There is zero evidence that the Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;program&quot; causes people to quit drinking.

</font>
<p>
I recognize that the program is not for everyone, and everyone has their
right to express their
views.  I certainly don't feel like I'm part of a cult in any ways or  form.
I enjoy the spirituality the program
has afforded me and I enjoy the friendships I have made.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Cult members usually don't feel like they are in a cult. They feel like they are in something
really special.
<p>
(If someone feels like he is in a cult, then he is waking up, and he will soon leave the cult.)
</font>
<p>
Can you offer me a better way to stay sober and without a drink ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sure. Just abstain from both alcohol and cult religion.
It's pretty simple. I've been doing it for 8 years now.
<p>
What you  are bringing up here is another problem with Alcoholics Anonymous.
They teach that you must have &quot;a program&quot; or &quot;a way&quot; to quit drinking. That is nonsense.
That is a trick to addict people to the cult, and make them think that they need it.
  The real way to quit drinking alcohol is:
You just quit drinking alcohol and then get on with your life.

<p>
</font>
<p>
There's 3 sides to every coin.  You have your side, AA has theirs, and  then
the third side is that I'm not going
to get loaded, and drive around with one hand on my eye to focus on the
road.  A family with kids loaded in
a van doesn't have to worry about me killing them today.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And that is an attempt to use the standard propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape Via Relativism</a>&quot;.
As in,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's just your opinion versus my opinion, and one opinion is just as good as another.
There are two sides to every argument (or '3 sides to every coin').&quot;
</font>
<p>
That just isn't true. Some opinions or viewpoints are based on a careful examination of all of
the facts, and some opinions are based on ignorance, misinformation,
prejudice, superstition, or irrational desires like the desire to gain acceptance in a certain group
by parrotting dogma and doctrines.

It's nice that the vanload of kids is safe, but you have not supplied any evidence that practicing

Your assumption that A.A. made you quit drinking is like this:

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
&quot;When I was a child, I was never able to ride a bicycle.<br>
I just couldn't do it. I fell down every time I tried.<br>
I was <i>powerless over bicycles</i>.<br>
Then one day, Jimmy loaned me his lucky rabbit's foot, and it worked! I succeeded! I didn't
fall down.<br>
That proves it: the lucky rabbit's foot <i>helped me</i> to stay up on the bicycle.
Now I can ride bicycles because I have a magic rabbit's foot.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Walt Disney did the same routine with Dumbo and the Magic Flying Feather.
The &quot;magic feather&quot; that the crow gave to Dumbo &quot;made&quot;
Dumbo able to fly.  And when Dumbo lost the feather, he panicked and went into a dive
and nearly crashed because he &quot;knew&quot; that he needed that feather and couldn't
fly without it.
<p>
When people tell me that the Twelve Steps &quot;made&quot; them quit drinking or doping,
or &quot;helped&quot; them to quit, I always think about Dumbo's Magic Flying Feather.
<p>
What you have not even mentioned, or considered, is the harm that A.A. does to people.
Rather than being the salvation of alcoholics, A.A. is actually an organization that hurts
more people than it helps.  When A.A. was tested, the results revealed a disaster:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, the A.A. Trustee,
found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective, and raised the death rate in alcoholics.
No other way of treating alcoholics produced such a high death rate as did Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ol>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Then there is the problem with people who are told not to take their doctor-prescribed medications
by the dogmatic fools in A.A. who imagine that the A.A. program can somehow do faith healing.
That contributes to the death rate too.
<p>
<li>
 And then there are the people who are driven to suicide,
both by the deprivation of psychiatric medications, and by
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">the constant drum-beat of A.A. putdowns</a>
&#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are sinful and powerless over alcohol. Confess everything. You can't ever recover.
You are selfish and dishonest and <i>in denial</i>.&quot;
</font>
Some people decide that they would rather die than put up with A.A. for the rest of their lives.
<p>
<li>
Then there is the problem with A.A. and N.A. destroying marriages. Read
<a href="orange-letters97.html#na_cult">this sad story</a>.
And then read <a href="orange-letters79.html#tc_nightmare">this one</a>.

<p>
<li>
And then there are the groups that degenerate into little Peyton Places, whose main purpose seems to be to
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">supply under-age girls to the old sponsors</a>.
I have received reports of such groups in Washington DC, Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, California, Washington state,
and more.

<p>
<li>
Then there are the people who are reduced to mindlessly babbling thought-stopping slogans and cult religion
dogma for the rest of their lives, and who have no life outside of the 12-Step cult.
<p>
<li>
Then there are the people who are driven to relapse by the depressing Alcoholics Anonymous atmosphere.


</ul>
<p>
Add it all up, and you have an organization that hurts more people than it helps.
<p>
Actually, how could it be otherwise? How could practicing an old cult religion from the nineteen-twenties
and -thirties really cure &quot;alcoholism&quot;?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

It may have been important to add that Dumbo did end up flying as a result
of using his own will power and his belief that he could fly. Adding this
may help shed some light on the stepper! Have a great day Orange.

Hi again, Michael,
<p>
Good point. I sort of assumed that everyone knew how the story ended, but it's worth mentioning again. When Dumbo finally learned
the truth, and overcame his fears, he could fly without the &quot;magic feather&quot;.
He needed no mental crutches. And he certainly didn't spend the rest of his life going to meetings where he extolled the virtues
of Magic Flying Feathers.

AA clearly states they do not have a monopoly on recovery, a member is also

Bill Wilson wrote a few mild statements that were intended to
