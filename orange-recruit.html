<a name="spiritual_conquer">
The</a> &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, contains an
entire manual for setting up a cult and recruiting new members.

The recruiting manual is all of Chapter Seven of the book.
Before that, the author, William G. Wilson, wrote his
initial rationalization for selling religious faith
as the only solution to a medical problem in Chapter Four
of the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit
entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the
amount you take, you are probably alcoholic. If that be the
case, you <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> suffering from an illness which only a
spiritual experience will conquer.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, <i>We Agnostics</i>, page 44.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is crazy. That is also bad medicine. There is no disease
recognized by either the American Medical Association, or the
American Psychiatric Association, which <i>&quot;only a
spiritual experience will conquer.&quot;</i>
But this is the dogma, one of the core beliefs, upon which
Alcoholics Anonymous is based.
A.A. teaches that you can't
 &quot;just quit drinking&quot; or &quot;just abstain&quot;.
You <i>must</i> join A.A., do the Twelve Steps, and have a
&quot;spiritual experience&quot;, in order to quit drinking.

<p>
<a name="hopeless1"> </a>
Bill continued:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To one who feels he is an
atheist or agnostic such an experience seems impossible, but to
continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an
alcoholic of the hopeless variety. To be doomed to an alcoholic
death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy
alternatives to face.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, <i>We Agnostics</i>, page 44.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is false logic and deliberate deception:
Mr. Wilson is playing mind games with your head,
using the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>Sly Suggestions</i></a>
propaganda technique again and again.
Bill starts with,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;you <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> suffering from an
illness&quot;</font>
and then jumps right to
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;you are doomed to an alcoholic
death&quot;</font>,
while hardly pausing to take a breath. He never bothers to
collect any supporting facts to change the
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;You <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> sick&quot;</font>
medical diagnosis into
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;<b>You gonna die!</b>&quot;</font>
<p>
In addition, Mr. Wilson has given us no evidence whatsoever
that having a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; or &quot;living
on a spiritual basis&quot; is necessary,
or even helpful, for quitting drinking.
Yet Bill insists that it is essential: we will die without it.

<p>
And Bill Wilson feels that this broken logic is proof enough
to demand that all skeptics be converted to
believing in his religious ideas:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But it isn't so difficult. About half our
original fellowship were of exactly that type. At first some of
us tried to avoid the issue, hoping against hope we were not
true alcoholics. But after a while we had to face the fact that
we must find a spiritual basis of life &#8212; or else. Perhaps it
is going to be that way with you. But cheer up, something like
half of us thought we were atheists or agnostics. Our
experience shows that you need not be disconcerted.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, <i>We Agnostics</i>, page 44.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>You need not be disconcerted.</i> Half of the Alcoholics Anonymous
members have already been
forced through a religious conversion against their will, and they
survived it, and so will you.
</font>

<p>
<a name="need_Higher_Power"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Lack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a power
by which we could live, and it had to be a Power greater
than ourselves. Obviously. But where and how were we to find
this Power? Well, that's exactly what this book is about. Its
main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than
yourself which will solve your problem.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 4, <i>We Agnostics</i>, page 45.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed: the main object is to get you to believe in God,
Wilson-style. Quitting drinking seems to be secondary.
<p>

Likewise, in Chapter Five, Wilson declared:
<p> 
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Remember that we deal with alcohol &#8212; cunning, baffling, powerful!
Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all
power &#8212; that One is God. May you find Him now!<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 5, <i>How It Works</i>, pages 58-59.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="acquire_faith"> </a>
And, in the beginning of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have no desire to convince anyone that there is only one way
by which faith can be acquired. &nbsp; ...<br>
Those having religious affiliations will find nothing here disturbing
to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over
such matters.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson,
Chapter 2, <i>There Is A Solution</i>, page 28.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note Bill's implication that people must &quot;acquire faith&quot;
(as if they didn't have any).
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a quit-drinking program; it's an
&quot;acquire faith&quot; program. And the faith that you must
acquire is
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">faith in Bill Wilson and
his cult religion</a>.


<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

All of chapter seven of the <i>Big Book</i> &#8212; <i>&quot;Working With Others&quot;</i> &#8212;
is a recruiting manual that teaches A.A.  members how to go recruiting. That chapter begins with the words,
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive
work with other alcoholics. It works when other activities fail. This is our <i>twelfth suggestion</i>:
Carry this message to other alcoholics!<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 7, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 89.</font>
<p>
<font color="#7F0000">
(Oh really? Immunity from drinking? Since when do we vaccinate people against drinking alcohol?
And what other A.A. activities fail to help alcoholics to abstain from drinking alcohol?)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Chapter Seven clearly describes the deceptive recruiting practices and mind games that will be
used to seduce and convert newcomers. It starts with, find a prospect, and start working on him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Don't start out as an evangelist or reformer.  Unfortunately a lot of prejudice exists.
You will be handicapped if you arouse it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, page 89.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, people are prejudiced against crazy cults and their
missionaries, and don't like to be bothered by them, unfortunately.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Sometimes it is wise to wait till he goes on a binge. The
family may object to this, but unless he is in a dangerous
physical condition, it is better to risk it. Don't deal with him
when he is very drunk, unless he is ugly and the family needs
your help. Wait for the end of the spree, or at least for a
lucid interval. Then let his family or a friend ask him if he
wants to quit for good and if he would go to any extreme to do
so. If he says yes, then his attention should be drawn to you as
a person who has recovered. You should be described to him as
one of a fellowship who, as part of their own recovery, try to
help others and who will be glad to talk to him if he cares to
see you.
<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 90.</font>

<p>
Call on him while he is still jittery. He <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> more
receptive when depressed.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 91.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
What a setup. Call on him when he is sick, hung over, jittery,
and depressed.
He will be in the weakest and most vulnerable condition then.
And then start to play mind games on his head: Get him to write
a blank check &#8212; he must be willing to go to <i>any extreme</i>
to stop being sick &#8212; just coming to his senses and getting a grip
and quitting drinking isn't nearly enough. Then carefully
do a little social engineering:
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
See your man alone, if possible. At first engage in general conversation.
After a while, turn the talk to some phase of drinking.
Tell him enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences
to encourage him to speak of himself.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 91.</font>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

This is standard Buchmanism, just the regular recruiting
techniques used by
Frank Buchman's cult,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#conviction" target="_blank">&quot;The Five
C's&quot;</a>.

First, the recruiter confesses
things about himself, to get the trust and confidence of the prospect.
Then the prospect confesses something in return.
Then the recruiter turns it around, and uses it against him,
amplifying it and exaggerating it as much as possible,
to get the prospect to feel terribly guilty,
and to &quot;convict himself&quot; &#8212; to find himself guilty &#8212; of
some sin or crime.
Then, the only way for the prospect to escape from the feelings of
guilt is to surrender to religious conversion. Frank Buchman developed
that procedure into an art form, and called it
<i>&quot;Soul Surgery&quot;</i>.
Then some of Buchman's followers taught the technique to Bill Wilson.
Now Wilson is teaching it to the A.A. recruiters.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If his mood is light, tell him humorous stories of your escapades.
Get him to tell some of his.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 91.</font>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, the setup, getting his confidence, and getting him to reveal
his history and his secrets.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When he sees you know all about the drinking game, commence to
describe yourself as an alcoholic.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 91.</font><br>

<a name="hopeless"> </a>
<p>
If you are satisfied that he is a real alcoholic, begin to dwell on the
hopeless feature of the malady. Show him, from your own experience, how
the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal
functioning of the will power.
<font color="#9F0000">Don't, at this stage, refer to this book</font>,
unless he has seen it and
wishes to discuss it.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 92.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another mind game: Tell him that his situation is hopeless.
That is the cult practice of
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank"><i>Phobia Induction</i></a>.
Suggest to him that his thinking is faulty, that he is suffering from
a queer mental condition.
That is the cult characteristic
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank"><i>'Newcomers can't think right'</i></a>.
Don't mention the <i>Big Book</i>, because we don't want him to know
that we are following a recipe in a manual,
and we also don't want to disclose other information in the book
that he isn't supposed to know yet, like how this recruiting scam works, or
<a href="orange-letters24.html#fanatically_religious" target="_blank">just how fanatically religious this cult really is</a>.

<p>
<a name="join_quick"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And be careful not to brand him as an alcoholic.
Let him draw his own conclusion. If he sticks to the idea that he can
still control his drinking, tell him that possibly he can &#8212; if he is
not too alcoholic. But insist that if he is severely afflicted,
there <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> little chance he can recover by himself.
<p>
Continue to speak of alcoholism as an illness, a
fatal malady. Talk about the conditions of body and mind which
accompany it. Keep his attention focussed mainly on your
personal experience. Explain that many are doomed who never
realize their predicament.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson, page 92.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
These are some powerful mind games:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;You will die if you don't
do things my way. You may think that you can recover on your own,
but, your 'queer mental condition'
renders your thinking useless, so your odds aren't too good...
You will die before you even realize your predicament. You had better
join my cult right now, while you still can.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Doctors are rightly loath to tell
alcoholic patients the whole story unless it will serve some
good purpose. But you may talk to him about the hopelessness of

</blockquote>
<p>
Yes,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="_blank">the members of the cult

that your doctor won't.
<font color="blue">
(Now whether those things are true is another matter...)
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>

the traits of the alcoholic.<br>

<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 92.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dream on. You will soon have him admitting things?
Next, confessing things?

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If his own doctor is willing to tell him that he is
alcoholic, so much the better. Even though your protege may not

to know how you got well.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, pages 92-93.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now he's a prot&eacute;g&eacute;? We just met a few minutes ago.
And now the prospect is curious? Notice how skillfully Wilson plays
his mind games. Bill Wilson was trained in <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>
techniques by Frank Buchman's cult, The Oxford Group, and he was a
good student. Then Bill took courses like Dale Carnegie's <i>How to
Win Friends and Influence People</i>. Bill really knew how to
manipulate and influence people's minds, and did it deliberately,
and now he's teaching the recruiter his techniques.

<br>
<a name="redefineGod"> </a>
<a name="stress_spiritual"> </a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Let him ask you that question, if he will.

</blockquote>
<p>
Why are you supposed to
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Stress the spiritual feature freely&quot;</i>?<br></font>

Because you are <i><b>NOT</b></i> supposed to stress
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;the religious feature&quot;</i>.</font><br>
Keep on repeating the lie,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;It's spiritual, not religious,&quot;</font>
when the prospect objects and says,
<font color="blue">&quot;I don't want to join a religion.&quot;</font>

<p>
This:
<font color="#4f007f">
<b><i>&quot;make it
emphatic that he does not have to agree with your conception of
God&quot;</i></b></font>
is <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>.
The recruiters also tell the prospects,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You can believe in any God you want, or none at all.
You can have any Higher Power you want.&quot;<br></font>
But that isn't true. The whole goal of the A.A. program is to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">
get people to believe in God</a>, and in many other things, like faith
healing and the Twelve Steps,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#wiggle" target="_blank">
exactly as Bill Wilson tells them to</a>.<br>

<ul>
<li> All of Chapter Four of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank"><i>We Agnostics</i></a>,
is devoted to spelling out exactly how all doubters must be converted
into true believers.
None of that chapter is about how to quit drinking.

<li> And soon, this chapter will tell how even
faithful believers in other religions must accept A.A. beliefs
as being better than their own beliefs, because their own religion
didn't keep them from drinking.

<li> Likewise, the Hazelden Foundation literature teaches us that we
should <a href="orange-spirrel.html#undercut" target="_blank">set our own religion
aside</a> if it doesn't give us A.A.-style &quot;spirituality.&quot;

<li> In order to work the Twelve Steps, you must believe in a
micro-managing meddling God who will take control of your will and
your life, and answer your prayers and grant your wishes, and remove your &quot;defects
of character&quot; and moral &quot;shortcomings&quot;, and then
talk to you, and educate you and give you your work orders and the
power to carry them out.
Very few religions push that particular image of God.
</ul>
<p>

But prospects and new members, whom A.A. calls
&quot;pigeons&quot; and &quot;babies&quot;, are
not told that up front.
<p>
Once the prospects have been recruited and brought into the group,
the old-timers will set to work indoctrinating
the newcomers and pressuring them to bring their beliefs
into agreement with the rest of the group.
A book called the <i>&quot;Serenity Bible&quot;</i> describes that theistic
bait-and-switch process precisely, using more
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>Sly Suggestions</i></a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#9F0000"> <font color="#9F0000">We may </font> </font> start out as agnostics.
<font color="#9F0000"> <font color="#9F0000">We may </font> </font> then come to view the group
or recovery process as our higher power, looking to other
people for strength. Gradually, we accept a vague notion of god,
which grows to a more specific monotheistic god.
 <font color="#9F0000"> <font color="#9F0000">We may </font> </font> even begin to pray to and dialogue with this god.
Eventually we come to know the one true God.<br>

<p>
The alcoholics (<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#drunks" target="_blank" target="_blank">whom
Bill Wilson deprecatingly called &quot;drunks&quot; who didn't want
to be good</a>)
just wanted to quit drinking; they didn't want to
join Bill's crazy Buchmanite cult religion with its ridiculous Absolutes.
So Bill Wilson's answer to that problem was to deceive the newcomers,
and hide the intense religiosity of A.A., and to also hide
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank" target="_blank">the Buchmanite Oxford Group cult
religion roots</a> of Alcoholics Anonymous, until after the newcomers had been
indoctrinated and brainwashed enough...
Mr. Wilson candidly admitted that he was practicing
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>,
not honestly telling the newcomers what membership in his group would really
entail.
And now, the A.A. slogan

Notice how Bill Wilson claimed that the prospects' reluctance to join
a cult religion was &quot;clinging to their other defects&quot;.
In Bill Wilson's mind, the alcoholics had to both quit drinking and
join his religion in order to be good people.
<p>
Also note that the absurd <i>&quot;Four Absolutes&quot;</i>
were not exactly restricted to the Oxford Groups.
The popular terminology was, but the thinking wasn't.
Most cult religions encourage irrational absolute
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#black_and_white" target="_blank">black-and-white thinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_perfection" target="_blank">impossible,

Downplay and soft-pedal the religiosity.

Notice how Bill Wilson declared that agnostics or atheists who wouldn't believe
in his peculiar Buchmanite religious ideas were <i>&quot;prejudiced&quot;</i>
and <i>&quot;already confused&quot;</i> about <i>&quot;certain
theological terms and conceptions&quot;</i>.
Such arrogance.
Mr. Wilson won't admit that many
very intelligent, well-educated people &#8212; both non-believers and believers &#8212;
who clearly understand what theological terms mean, still
strongly disagree with Bill's
religious proclamations for a variety of good reasons.
<p>
Even the Pope would disagree with the theology of Frank Buchman
and Bill Wilson, because it is <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">grossly heretical nonsense</a>.
In fact,
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban" target="_blank">the Vatican did ban
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament cults</a> &#8212; twice &#8212;
specifically because of its bad theology &#8212; and the Pope ordered
that no good Catholics should go to Oxford Group meetings or work with Moral Re-Armament.
<p>
But Bill Wilson just claimed that people who objected to his
peculiar Buchmanite religious tenets were all
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#think_honestly" target="_blank">thinking dishonestly</a>,
and trying to
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#evade" target="_blank">evade the

<p>

(That is Bill's <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic

see everything clearly, Bill thinks. Everybody else
is just confused and prejudiced and thinking dishonestly and fooling themselves...)
</font>

<p>
<a name="example_vital"> </a>
Bill Wilson continued with his recruiting manual, and implied that
A.A. was better than other religions:
<p>
<a name="believer"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

learn why his own convictions have not worked and why yours seem
to work so well. He <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is a vicious mind game of religious one-upmanship:
If someone is having troubles with alcohol, claim that it proves
that his religious beliefs and faith are inferior to those of the
Alcoholics Anonymous members:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;his own convictions have not worked&quot;</font>,
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;his faith was insufficient&quot;.</font>
<ul>
<li>
Who said that the goal of all religious convictions is to treat or
cure alcohol abuse?
<li> Who said that religious convictions are supposed to <i>&quot;work&quot;</i>
at all? Who says that religious beliefs are supposed to function and
work in a certain manner? We are not talking about cars or computers here.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="Jackie"> </a>
Note the slick propaganda tricks:<br>
<ol>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;He <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> an example of the truth that faith
alone is insufficient.&quot;</i><br></font>
You get a soft
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>Sly Suggestion</i></a>&quot;
followed by absolute dogma:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;He <i>may</i> be an example of one of Bill Wilson's
<i>unquestionably-true</i> religious beliefs.&quot;<br>
</font>
And Bill also slips in, as if it were established fact, his religious
belief that &quot;faith alone is insufficient&quot; &#8212; to stay sober,
members must also constantly go recruiting.
That is the technique called &quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assume the
Major Premise</a>&quot;.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;his own convictions have not worked and ... yours seem to work so well.&quot;</i><br></font>
That is two more examples of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assume the Major Premise</a>&quot;
and
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>Sly Suggestion</i></a>&quot;.
Bill suggests that the A.A. recruiter's religion must be working much
better than the prospect's, because the recruiter isn't drinking.
</ol>

<p>
But is that true? Is the recruiter really a living example of a good religion?
The recruiter may appear to have his act together, but that is often a sham.
He <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> <i>&quot;faking it until he makes it.&quot;</i>
The usual path for new cult members is to become true believers early in the game,
and enthusiastically go recruit others, and then, eventually,
the older members will become disillusioned and leave,

<ul>
<li>
just like how
Bill Wilson's own recruiter
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">Ebby Thacher</a>
did.
<li>
And just like how the <i>Big Book</i> co-author
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#screw_Hank" target="_blank">Henry Parkhurst</a> did.

<li>
And just like how <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#relapsers" target="_blank">Jackie and Paddy and Florence did</a>.
</ul>
<p>
Just look around an A.A. meeting, and ask yourself,
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">Where are
all of the old-timers</a>, the ones with 20 or 30 years? Why are even the
guys with just 10 years sober in A.A. just a bit unusual?&quot;
<p>
<center><table width="93%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

One story in the <i>Big Book</i> says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All of us in A.A. know the tremendous happiness that is in our sobriety,
but there are also tragedies. My sponsor, Jackie, was one of these.
He brought in many of our original members, yet he himself could not
make it and died of alcoholism.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
page 239.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After being dry two weeks and sticking close to Jackie,
all of a sudden I found I had become the sponsor of my
sponsor, for he was suddenly taken drunk.
I was startled to learn that he had only been off the booze for
a month or so himself when he brought me the message!<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
page 245.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise, an A.A. enthusiast named Paddy was doing
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Paddy" target="_blank">the same thing</a> over
in Boston, recruiting and relapsing, recruiting and relapsing,
until he died of alcohol poisoning.
And a little later, the guy who started Alcoholics Anonymous
in South Africa, nick-named
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#Appleseed" target="_blank">Johnny
Appleseed</a>&quot;, did the same thing, too.
So did
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Lillian_Roth" target="_blank">the childhood movie star Lilian Roth</a>,
who founded A.A. in New Zealand and then relapsed and died drunk.

<p>
(Then the A.A. members will say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Don't confuse the message with the messenger. The message is perfect,
it is just the messengers who are flawed and weak.&quot;</font>)
<p>
So just because the recruiter looks sober and happy right now doesn't necessarily
mean that he is going to stay that way for very long. The recruiter isn't really
living proof that A.A. or the Twelve Steps actually work to keep people sober.
And the sober A.A. recruiter isn't really living proof that the A.A. religion is better
than other peoples' religions.

<p>
You too may end up being the sponsor of your sponsor.

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
And note that here is where Mr. Wilson begins his campaign to convert
all believers of other religions to his own religious beliefs,
while he also declares that A.A. is not a religion, and that you
are free to have any religious beliefs you wish.

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> also says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I had been brought up to believe in God, but I know that until I
found this A.A. program, I had never found or known faith in the
reality of God, the reality of His power that is now with me in
everything I do.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
anonymous, page 341.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yes, A.A. is <i>much better</i> than other religions.
So you should convert to Mr. Wilson's religious beliefs.

<p>
All of these games of religious one-upmanship contradict the happy P.R.
statement that Mr. Wilson made earlier in the <i>Big Book</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those having religious affiliations will find nothing here disturbing
to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over
such matters.<br></font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, page 28.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Besides which, A.A. starts off telling you that &quot;alcoholism&quot;
is a disease, often caused by inheriting a gene for alcoholism from
your father.
What do faith and religious beliefs have to do with
a congenital disease? Real doctors don't say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You have cystic fibrosis. You had better change your religious
beliefs, fast.&quot;</font>

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> recruiting manual continues:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To be vital, faith must be accompanied by
self sacrifice and unselfish, constructive action.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, page 93.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, this is a misleading statement.
Those terms, &quot;self sacrifice&quot; and
&quot;unselfish, constructive action&quot;
are so vague and generic that they could mean anything that Mr. Wilson
or A.A. want them to mean. And Bill usually wants them to mean,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Go recruit some more members for our little 'fellowship' if you
want your faith to be 'vital'.&quot;
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(Pardon a stupid question, but just what is &quot;vital faith&quot;,
and why should I want some, and how does it differ from
&quot;non-vital faith&quot;?)
</font>

<p>
There is a guilt-inducing accusation implied there:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Your own religious convictions haven't worked,
and your faith isn't vital, because you are selfish.&quot;</i><br>
<b>So quit being selfish. Go recruiting for us. Go get us some more
&quot;babies&quot; and &quot;pigeons&quot; if you want your faith
to work.</b>
</font>

<p>
And again, this is religion, not how to quit drinking.
The Catholics, Protestants, Jews, Buddhists, Moslems, Sufis, Bahais,
Hindus, and Native Americans have every right to (at least try to)
lecture me about faith, but not A.A., because A.A. says that it isn't a religion.

<p>
Wilson is teaching deceptive mind games again:
<ul>
<li> First, claim that you are not there to instruct him in religion.
<li> Second, display some false humility to flatter him and win
his trust. Tell him that he knows more about religion than you do.
<li> Third, assert that his drinking problems prove that his religious
beliefs and faith are inferior to those of the A.A. members, so he
had better switch religions and join the A.A. religion.
<li> And induce some guilt with this mind game:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;He could not have applied [his faith and religious knowledge]

<font color="blue">
What, you have to be an atheist to drink beer?

</ul>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Again, we see the
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#medical_moral" target="_blank">medical-to-moral-morph</a>&quot;
bait-and-switch stunt unfolding:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A.A. started off by telling the prospect that <b>alcoholism
is a disease</b> &#8212;
<ul>
<li> <i>&quot;an actual disease that has a name and symptoms like
diabetes or cancer or TB&quot;</i>
<font size="-1">(the <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, page 227)</font>,
<li> a progressive, incurable disease that is often caused by a gene
inherited from one's father,
</ul>
so it isn't his fault.
<p>
<li> And A.A. recites Step One: <i>&quot;We admitted we were powerless
over alcohol&quot;</i>, so it isn't his fault.
<p>
<li> But later, A.A. accuses the prospect of drinking because he has
moral shortcomings, his faith is insufficient, and
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;<b>he has failed</b> to
practice the very precepts [religion] he knows so well.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
<li> So what happened to the disease theory?
How and when did &quot;alcoholism&quot; suddenly get redefined as
<i>a failure to practice religion properly</i>?
</ul>

<p>
And this is also untrue:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We represent no particular faith or denomination.&quot;</i><br></font>
<font color="blue">
<b>They represent the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-Step religion, period.</b>
</font>
<p>
And they dissemble when they say that it isn't a religion.
Any sane reader should be able to see by now that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">it's a religion</a>.
(All of the judges and courts can see that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">it's a religion</a>.)
Mr. Wilson has done little else besides talk about God and faith and
how God will save you from alcoholism, <b><i>if</i></b>
 you confess enough and believe enough and recruit enough... And Bill Wilson spent
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">all of chapter four of
the <i>Big Book</i></a> lecturing everybody about how they had to
believe in God, just like Bill did, and convert to Bill's religion, or else.
Bill gave no helpful information in chapter 4 about how to actually quit drinking and stay quit.
That is a religion, not a quit-drinking program.

<p>
And Bill said,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;We are dealing only with general principles common to most denominations.&quot;</i>
</font>
No way Jos&eacute;!
<ul>
<li> The A.A. dogma is very peculiar, a sort of Calvinism with genetic
predestination, where you inherit genes, alcoholism, sins and spiritual
diseases from your father...
<li> And A.A. is sort of like Christian Science when it comes to faith
healing and insisting that God is the only permissible cure for a disease.
<li> And A.A. is
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's crazy cult religion</a>
all the way: insisting that people have to
confess their sins to each other to be holy, and have to spend their
lives in group meetings, and have to
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">channel</a>&quot;
God and hear God dictating orders.
</ul>
<p>
A.A. has almost nothing in common with any sane, ordinary religion.
Can you imagine thinking you are in a Catholic mass or a Baptist
church service when you walk into an A.A. meeting? Not a ghost of
a chance.<br>
<ul>
<li> Will the Catholics, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, or Episcopalians
tell you that your congenital medical problems must be cured by God alone?
<li> Will they tell you that you have to do 90 church services in 90 days
to be a good beginner?
<li> Will they tell you that you are a hopeless case,
that you are powerless over temptation, and that salvation is
not available to you, that you cannot ever be reformed, redeemed, or
&quot;saved&quot;,
and that the only thing you can do is give up and
surrender to God-control, and hope that God will make
a good little puppet out of you?
<li> Will they tell you that you must go to two or three church
services or confession meetings per week for the rest of your
life, or else?
<li> Will any of those churches tell you to conduct a s&eacute;ance and
pray and meditate until you hear voices in your head, telling you what to do,
and then you should go and do whatever the voices say? (Step 11.)
</ul>
<p>
The simple answer is, &quot;No. Most denominations won't tell you that.&quot;
<p>

One critic on the Internet said it beautifully:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I fail to see how the Judeo/Christian God is the one referred to 
by Bill W., nor do I think that the 12-Step cult holds any considerable 
similarities to major religions. None of them consider &quot;newcomers&quot;
to be sick 
people who must be introduced to the religions piecemeal, nor do they use 
cliches and other insulting language in a sophisticated attempt to make the 
congregation passive. In writing that, I just tried to picture in my mind an 
actual sermon, where the priest tells his colorful &quot;story&quot;
of his life before 
joining the church (to the laughter of the congregation,) and pleads,
&quot;your 
best thinking got you here. 90 services in 90 days. Fake it 'til you make it. 
Keep it simple, stupid. Keep coming back, it works if you work it, you die if you 
don't, so work it, you're worth it!&quot; ... and I laughed.<br>

<p>
Bill Wilson's recruiting manual continues:
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Yeh, I can't get my merit badge in recruiting until I get three more new converts.</i>
</font>
<p>
Actually, this is also standard cult behavior:
It is called
&quot;<b><a href="orange-propaganda.html#selfsell" target="_blank">actionizing</a></b>&quot;,
or
&quot;<b><a href="orange-propaganda.html#selfsell" target="_blank">self-sell</a></b>&quot;.
The trick is to get new members out on the streets fast, busy
recruiting more members. The act of trying to convert others will
cement the new dogma in the minds of the recent converts, and they
will be convincing themselves as they try to convince others.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>
Outrageous. What did I tell you? We haven't even converted this guy yet,
and already we are telling him that he has to go recruiting for us.
<p>
And then we use a little shame and guilt induction to manipulate
his mind:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>Place other people's welfare ahead of your own, you selfish slob,
and go recruit some more members for our 'little fellowship'.</i>&quot;
</font>

<p>
And we also use some fear-mongering at the same time:<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It is very important that you place the welfare of
other people ahead of your own, or else the program won't work,
and you will die.&quot;<br></font>
<p>
<a name="sponsor_benefits"> </a>
Note the cute double-bind: Even if you claim that you are recruiting
for A.A.
because you are placing the welfare of others ahead of your own,
you are still out there recruiting because you are really trying
to save your own life (probably a lot more than theirs).
Indeed, it's nearly impossible to not be extremely interested in
your own welfare when we are talking about who will die.
So you should then feel guilty for being so selfish.

And maybe the recruiters really should feel guilty for being selfish
while recruiting and sponsoring &#8212;
recent research has shown that newcomers do not benefit
at all from getting sponsors. In a recent controlled study, a
group of new Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous
members who got sponsors did no
better than another group who didn't get sponsors. But strangely
enough, the sponsors did better than other members who did not
act as sponsors. It seems that getting their egos stroked by
acting as puffed-up,
all-wise, all-knowing gurus, ordering the wimpy newcomers around,
helps the sponsors to stay clean and sober, even if it doesn't help
the newcomers any.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Swiss,Helvetica">
Examined the relationship between sponsorship and abstinence in 12-Step
treatment of injection drug users. 500 former and current injection drug users
(median age 39 yrs) reported sponsorship in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) at baseline and at 6-mo and 1-yr follow-ups. Results
show that having a sponsor in NA/AA was not associated with any improvement in
1-yr sustained abstinence rates compared to non-sponsored controls. However,
being a sponsor over the same time period was strongly associated with substantial
improvements in sustained abstinence rates, even after controlling for involvement
with community organizations, NA/AA meeting attendance, marital status,
employment, participation in drug and alcohol treatment centers, and HIV status.<br>

Traditionally, the sponsor is supposed to say that he isn't
doing it for the newcomer; that he's doing it for his own sobriety.
Remember that the <i>Big Book</i> actually instructs recruiters to
tell new prospects:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... explain ... why you are now endeavoring to be helpful to him.
It is important for him to realize that your attempt to pass this
on to him plays a vital part in your recovery. Actually,
he <font color="#9F0000">may be</font> helping you more than you are helping him.<br>

But who would have believed that it was really true that the recruiters
were not doing it for the benefit of the newcomers, and that the
newcomers would not benefit from the sponsors' &quot;help&quot;?

Wilson continued with the recruiting manual:
<p>
<a name="hopeless2"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Maybe you have disturbed him about the question of

William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 94.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, more scheming mind games.
Disturb him, and make him feel hopeless,
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>the more hopeless the better</i></font>, so that he will give up,
and despair of saving himself, and
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult" target="_blank">surrender to you
and the cult</a>.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Do not be discouraged if your prospect does not respond at once.
Search out another alcoholic and try again. You are sure to
find someone desperate enough to accept with eagerness what you

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed. <i>We aren't trying to save alcoholics here, we are trying
to get more cult members.</i> Don't waste your time on the
ones who won't join the cult. Keep fishing, and you will find someone
<b>desperate</b> enough to grab, like a drowning man, at anything
you hold out.
And you will find somebody; that's how this cult succeeds in
getting new members.
<p>
<font color="blue">
And note Bill Wilson's
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">delusions of grandeur</a>
showing again:
<font color="#4f007f">
If you don't push some alcoholic into Bill's program, then
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#denied_recovery" target="_blank">
you will be denying him the &quot;opportunity to live
and be happy.&quot;</a></font>
Bill actually claimed that alcoholics couldn't possibly recover, be happy, or even live,
without his Alcoholics Anonymous program.
Nobody else in the whole world had the magic. Just Bill Wilson.
That is the standard cult characteristic of
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank"><i>We have THE ONLY WAY</i></a>.
</font>

<p>
<a name="recruit_family1"> </a>
Ah, but don't give up too easily. Even if you can't talk the
alcoholic into joining Alcoholics Anonymous, maybe you can recruit
the rest of his family into the Al-Anon and Alateen branches of the
12-Step religion:
<p>
<a name="recruit_family"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should
neglect his family. You should continue to be friendly to them.
The family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept
and practice spiritual principles, there is a much better chance
that the head of the family will recover. And even though he continues
to drink, the family will find life more bearable.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 97.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, all is not lost, even if he won't join A.A. &#8212;
you can still recruit his wife and kids
into the other branch of the organization, <i>Al-Anon</i>, where they will
practice Bill Wilson's <i>&quot;spiritual way of life&quot;</i>,
doing his Twelve Steps, confessing all of their sins and
hearing the Voice of God telling them what to do. 

<p>
<font color="blue">
Note, once again, that Alcoholics Anonymous is not really a quit-drinking
program, it's a religion. Drafting the wife and kids into the program
is a dead give-away. They don't drink, and they don't need a quit-drinking program.

<p>
Note the subtle, veiled, hints of magic:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Should they accept and practice spiritual principles,
there is a much better chance that the head of the family will
recover.&quot;</font><br>
In other words, if the rest of the family joins Bill's cult and believes the right things,
says the right prayers,
incants the correct spells, and performs the correct
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Buchmanite</a> rituals,
it might make Daddy quit drinking.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">Oh really, Bill? How will that happen?</font>

<p>
Bill Wilson clearly said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;The family should be offered your way of life.&quot;</font><br>

And Bill's &quot;way of life&quot; is going to zillions of meetings,
doing the Twelve Steps,
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">wallowing in guilt, self-doubt, and harmful self-contempt</a>,
believing superstitious nonsense, 
and recruiting for the cult.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">No way does the wife need that...</font>

<p>
The argument that the family should be recruited because
maybe the alcoholic will join A.A. later is
pretty flimsy. And the claim that somehow, the family's life will be
made more &quot;bearable&quot; by Bill's &quot;spiritual way of life&quot;
clearly indicates that it's a religion that is supposed to
somehow give you comfort and help you to bear your load of
woes and suffering.
<font color="#9F0000">(Even if it doesn't cure anybody
 of &quot;alcoholism&quot;.)</font>

<p>
So, just how <i>IS</i> the wife's confessing all of her sins to her sponsor
supposed to make her husband's suicidal drinking more &quot;bearable&quot;?
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#005F00">
Also notice that Bill was laying the roots for Al-Anon when he wrote
the original manuscript for the <i>Big Book</i> in late 1938 and early
1939. The official A.A. story is that his wife Lois Wilson founded Al-Anon much
later on, so that the wives would have something to do while the men
were in their A.A. meetings.
That is obviously not true at all. Bill Wilson was already recruiting the wives and children
into his religion when he wrote the front chapters of the <i>Big Book</i> in 1938.
But of course. Bill was really pushing the Oxford Group cult religion, not a
cure for &quot;alcoholism&quot;. Wives and children were always fair game for recruiting efforts.
Wives and children made up a big percentage of the Oxford Group membership.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a name="service_plane"> </a>
Then, Mr. Wilson instructs the recruiter to be wary about loaning
the prospect money, or letting him live in his house for a while,
or giving too much other help.  On one level, this is good advice,
because too many down-and-out alcoholics are likely to take advantage
of such a situation if they can. But the rationalization for not
helping the alcoholic is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 98.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is remarkably similar to the Buchmanite
<a href="orange-rroot930.html#Tod_Sloan" target="_blank">Ted Stoan's
remarks</a> about how he
had made a big mistake by campaigning for poor school-children
to get meals and boots, because he had made &quot;materialists&quot;
out of them. And it also explains why Alcoholics Anonymous <i>never</i>
engages in any social work, and <i>never</i> helps the poor or homeless,
even though many of them are alcoholics.
<p>

Then Bill Wilson once again shows us the intensely religious and
magical nature of the program:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Job or no job &#8212; wife or no wife &#8212; we simply do not stop drinking
so long as we place dependence upon other people ahead of dependence
on God.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 98.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<font color="blue">
Then Bill couldn't help but go on a side trip for a page, and get in
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good" target="_blank">a few more jabs at his wife</a>:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though his family be at fault in many respects, he should not be
concerned about that.
He should concentrate on his own spiritual demonstration.
Argument and fault-finding are to be avoided like the plague.
In many homes this is a difficult thing to do, but it must be done
if any results are to be expected.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Little by little the family may see their own defects and admit
them. These can then be discussed in an atmosphere of helpfulness
and friendliness.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 98.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
Meaning:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Yeh, Lois. When are you going to admit your own defects, like
that you are really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Thumb" target="_blank">a horrible bitch who
nagged me for years</a>,
always demanding that I quit drinking and go get a job?
Now, I'm too spiritual to bring it
up and criticize you for it, but don't you think it's about time
that you 'cleaned house' and confessed it to me?&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
<font color="#7F0000">
A narcissist like Bill Wilson just could not admit that the difficulties and arguments with
his wife were his own fault for drinking too much &#8212; he just had to blame it all on Lois and demand
that <i>she</i> confess her faults.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#7F0000" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You can't win. There's no such
thing as a Narcissistic vampire being objective about his or her faults.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, Bill Wilson just can't help but make one more try at recruiting
the entire family into his religion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After they have seen tangible results, the family will perhaps want
to go along. These things will come to pass naturally and in good time...<br></font>

William G. Wilson, Chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 99.</font></blockquote>

<p>
<a name="marriage_counselor"> </a>
<br>
Then Bill switched to being a helpful marriage counselor:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If there be divorce or separation, there should be no undue
haste for the couple to get together. The man should be sure
of his recovery. The wife should fully understand his new way
of life. If their old relationship is to be resumed
<font color="#9F0000">it must be</font>
on a better basis, since the former did not work. This means a
new attitude and spirit all around. Sometimes it is to the best
interests of all concerned that a couple remain apart. Obviously,
no rule can be laid down. Let the alcoholic continue his program
day by day. When the time for living together has come, it will
be apparent to both parties.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, Chapter 7, &quot;Working With Others&quot;, page 99.</font></blockquote>
<p>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
Yes, she
<font color="#9F0000">must</font> &quot;fully understand&quot;
that Alcoholics Anonymous will now dominate his new life,
and that they shouldn't get back together until she knows her place and
is willing to stay in her place.
And if she won't accept the A.A. program, then the marriage should end.

<i>Again, we see Bill Wilson's Narcissistic Personality Disorder at work.
Bill routinely tried to 
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Nina_Brown3" target="_blank">off-load blame</a>

it was all her fault because she was a nag, she was no fun, she was a killjoy,

<p>
And if they can't get back together, Bill has this advice for the ex-wife:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But sometimes you must start life anew. We know women who have done it.

<p>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
So ladies, even if A.A. breaks up your marriage, you should still join Al-Anon
and adopt Bill Wilson's 12-Step &quot;spiritual way of life&quot;...</i></font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">Bill just can't stop recruiting, can he?</font>
<p>
No, he can't. Over on page 130, in the chapter <i>The Family Afterwards</i>,
Bill also wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions
or not, they may do well to examine the principles by which the
alcoholic member is trying to live. They can hardly fail to approve
these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails
somewhat in practicing them. Nothing will help the man who is off
on a spiritual tangent so much as the wife who adopts a sane
spiritual program, making a better use of it.<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 9, &quot;The Family Afterwards&quot;, page 130.</font></blockquote>

<p>
Note Bill's arrogant assumption that the women did not already have
a &quot;spiritual way of life&quot;, and didn't even know much about
spiritual things.
Any woman who, like Lois Wilson, could
play the thankless &quot;stand by your man&quot; role
and tolerate an arrogant obnoxious egotistical philandering drunkard like
Bill Wilson for <i>many</i> years,
and even go to work in a department store to support him
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#drunken_sot" target="_blank">while he stole money
out of her purse</a> to go buy more booze,
must have the patience of a saint...<br>
<font color="blue">
I think she already knows something about Bill's spiritual
principles like &quot;self-sacrifice&quot; and
&quot;unselfish, constructive action.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Note Bill's assumption that his &quot;simple principles&quot; are
so obviously true that no reasonable person could possibly
disagree with them:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They can hardly fail to approve
these simple principles.&quot;</font><br>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">
Delusions of grandeur</a> strike again.
<p>

Bill Wilson even thinks that his religion is the best cure for a family where
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#going_insane" target="_blank">Daddy has gone crazy</a>
from too much of Bill's religion:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Nothing will help the man who is off
on a spiritual tangent so much as the wife who adopts a sane
spiritual program, making a better use of it.&quot;</i></font><br>

So now the wife is supposed to join Al-Anon and get &quot;fixed&quot; by the
12-Step program that just drove Daddy crazy.
<p>
Having destroyed a bunch of marriages, Bill now takes off his
marriage-counselor hat and switches back to being a spiritual advisor:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Lastly, what if I find that just waking up without a hang-over

why can't the 12-Step &quot;G.O.D.&quot; be a &quot;Group Of Devils&quot;?

Then Wilson declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We are careful never to show intolerance or hatred of drinking
as an institution. Experience shows that such an attitude is
not helpful to anyone.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Why? I don't feel bad about damning the tobacco industry. Why
does alcohol deserve special treatment? Doesn't advertising
beer on TV during every sporting event increase drinking and cravings?<br>
<blockquote>

<i>Hint: Of course it does. That's why the big brewing companies spend
millions of dollars to air those commercials.</i>

Then Bill ended the recruiting manual with these declarations:
<p>
<a name="our_making"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After all, our problems were of our own making. Bottles were
only a symbol. Besides, we have stopped fighting anybody or
anything. We have to!<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, page 103.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Actually, our problems were made by a lot of things: God, physics, evolution,
biochemistry, genetics, medical problems, psychiatric problems,
childhoods, parents, life, society, history, culture, laws,
breweries, and ourselves.
<p>
<b>
Bottles are not a symbol, they are a container. The implication here
is that the disease theory of alcoholism has been completely discarded now,
and the moral model is installed. Now, the alcoholic is told that
his problems were of his own making, due to his own moral shortcomings,
his own personal sins, and his own failure to practice religious
precepts properly. Genetics and diseases do not count any more.
</b>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But it is clear that we made our own misery. God didn't do it.<br>

<p>
The

<b>A final, fun note:</b> If you true believers have stopped

Come along quietly now, I have some chains and shackles for you...
