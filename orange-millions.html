Alcoholics Anonymous members routinely parrot the claim that A.A. has saved millions of lives,
and that millions of alcoholics are sober because of A.A. That is totally false. A.A. does not even
have two million members in the entire world, and the majority of them are not sober.
<p>
In addition, most of the newcomers soon drop out. About 95% are gone within a year.
Only one in a hundred gets sober in A.A. for ten years.
Only one in a thousand makes it in A.A. for twenty years.

See these analyses of the A.A. success rate, which show that A.A. has basically a zero-percent cure rate:

<p><ol>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">Those sobriety coins given out</a>
&#8212; How many people go from picking up the One Day coin to getting the  5- or
10- or 20-years coins?

<p><li>
What was the sobriety rate in the early days of A.A.?
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous never saved millions of
alcoholics  &#8212;  that untrue slogan has been Bill Wilson's fraudulent claim from the very beginning</a>.


<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="_blank">Analysis of a spreadsheet from
the Foxhall Group in Omaha, Nebraska</a>, which shows that they have a terrible
retention rate. Each year, they take in 400 to 420 new people, and only 10 become
long-term sober members.


<p><li> A.A. does not have a retention rate, it has a churn rate. The routine is,
another 10,000 people are sentenced to A.A. by courts, or pushed into A.A. by a
so-called &quot;treatment center&quot;, or
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">coerced or pressured in some other manner</a>,
 and then another 10,000 people drop out of A.A.
See the following documents for a mathematical analysis of that. Especially see Section 4 of Part 2
for the retention rate and the effectiveness of A.A.

This one is the most damning evidence of all, because it came from a doctor
who loves Alcoholics Anonymous, and is one of its biggest promoters.
He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Inc., until he rotated off of the board.
Earlier, he also became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University.
Many years earlier,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For the better part of 20 years,
Dr. Vaillant treated alcoholics with Alcoholics Anonymous, and 
he tried hard to prove that A.A. works.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">His A.A.-based treatment
program produced a zero-percent success rate above
normal spontaneous remission, and worse, it had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment program that he studied.
Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
At the end of an 8-year tracking period, the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients
was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
<p>
But 5% per year is the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics &#8212;
what Dr. Vaillant called &quot;the natural history of alcoholism&quot;.
That's how many alcoholics recover on their own, alone, without any &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;support group&quot;. A.A. cannot claim the credit for those
recoveries, no matter whether they attend some A.A. meetings or not,
and Dr. Vaillant clearly said that.  So 5 minus 5 equals zero, the real A.A. recovery rate.

Nevertheless, the A.A. promoters never stop repeating the claim that millions of people are sober in

The A.A. claim that it has &quot;saved millions&quot; is just another
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">Big Lie</a>, some completely untrue grandiose bragging
that they have parrotted for so many years that they don't know when it started. Well,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">it started with Bill Wilson, here</a>.

<p>
A.A. does not even have 2 million members in the entire world, so they cannot possibly have saved millions.
The truth is that most of the A.A. membership is just churn &#8212; another 100,000 people are
forced into A.A. meetings for a little while, and then another 100,000 drop out.
And then another 100,000 go in, and then another 100,000 drop out.
There are only a few hundred thousand committed A.A. cult members in the whole world.
