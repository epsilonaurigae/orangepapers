<p>
Orange,

<p>
Thanks for responding and mentioning the part about &quot;Carla will try to use
Religion (with a capital 'R') to keep her sober&quot; as my ex-sponsor's
response. I am really not even that religious &#8212; raised Catholic &#8212; 
occasionally go to church but recently have gotten interested in some
aspects of Buddhism (I like the positive way you can talk to your self &#8212; 
antitheses of AA) I agree that she missed the point completely as if she
wasn't' listening or understanding what I was trying to say &#8212; &quot; I do not
need AA or anyone else telling me how to stay sober, be happy or run my
life&quot;.  I think the people that get stuck in the AA programs are lonely w/
low self-esteem and need to be around other people to get their approval,
listen to their sob stories so they feel better about themselves and
continue to be in a constant state of misery &#8212; always looking for something
to complain about or act superior because they have worked the Steps &#8212; oh
they are so supreme.  Maybe I did not have anyone else to apologize to &#8212; I
already did it &#8212; I just need to work on healing me and forgiving myself.  No
more steps, please. . . .  to each his own.

<p>
I am still doing great since I left AA and their little community.  Have
really enjoyed your website and started reading some of your recommendations
for books to read &#8212; Not sure if this was one of your suggestions but it is a
good one &#8212; by &quot;Marianne Gilliam&quot; &quot;How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me&quot; My
Personal Journey to Sobriety Through Self-Empowerment (the title itself just
makes you have high expectations to read it).  She talks a lot about how we
can heal our addictions &#8212; we just have to get to the root &#8212; I love the
positive idea of empowering yourself to make changes in your life and your
outlook of your self &#8212; AA would never get close to doing that &#8212; no way could
an alcoholic ever be cured.  I feel sorry for some of the young people in AA
&#8212; some of them may not even be alcoholic or drug addicts &#8212; maybe just a
rough childhood or low self-esteem.  Hopefully they will find another way or
come across your website &#8212; let's hope.

<p>
Thanks again for your response and a have a good day!<br>

Hi again, Richard,
<p>
Thanks for the note. That is a very good point to make. The
&quot;mere, small $25,000 per year&quot; that the A.A. apologists
said was all that Bill Wilson got from A.A. was not any small amount of pocket change.
It was a very healthy living.

Hello again, Researcher,

Thanks for the link. Ah yes, the Holy Grail of Alcoholics Anonymous.

The funny thing is,
<a href="orange-ahcain.html" target="_blank">Dr. Arthur H. Cain was criticizing A.A.</a>
 for making Dr. Bob's coffee pot into a holy relic way back in 1963:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A.A. as a group must recognize its real function: to serve as a bridge
from the hospital or the jail to the church &#8212; or to a sustaining
personal belief that life is worthwhile. It must not pose as a
spiritual movement that provides everything the alcoholic needs to
fulfill his destiny. It must not teach its young (as it does in
Alateen, its Sunday School for the children of alcoholics) such
catechisms as:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;We will always be grateful to Alateen for giving us a
way of life and a wonderful healthy program to live by and enjoy.&quot;
</font>
It must realize that &quot;the actual coffee pot Anne used to make the first
A.A. coffee&quot; (shown in &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Come of Age,&quot; Harper 1957,
a commentary on the A.A. bible, Alcoholics Anonymous, Works Publishing
Company, 1946) is not the Holy Grail. The cake and coffee served after
meetings are just refreshments, not the body and blood of Jesus Christ.<br>

<p>
Dear A.Orange

<p>
Thanks for your reply to my letter several months ago. I ranted about my
sentencing to AA and Drug court. Well I'm almost finished with the drug court
part of the sentencing of 1 year. I will graduate with full honor and blessings
from probation and my counselor as I have done everything I was supposed too do
and did it with sincerity as I found it to be quite helpful (drug court
classes). I had a very good counselor who really has true compassion,
understanding and empathy coupled with her intelligence as a well educated and
seasoned counselor. Altough I found many things disturbing throughout the course
of my recovery. The most disturbing aspects of all this was the absorption of
the stories other addicts have told and how they perceive and handle their
process of recovery. And another thing was my awakening to my denials of many
aspects of my behaviors.
<p>
Thru the last 5 or 6 years of my life I have been in and out of court ordered
AA, Mental health classes, and drug court. All court ordered. Well none of this
really did any real persuasion for me to abstain from my indulgence in alcohol.
I really did not give a damn if I quit or not. I just quite frankly did not give
a damn about trying to stop drinking altough deep down inside I knew it was not
right. Being the stubborn thick headed Irish blooded man that I am I figured I
could allways do whatever I wanted and the hell with the rest of the world. Well
thats all fine and dandy if one has the ways and means to take care of himself
and whomever else depended on me But that ain't the way things work in the real
world. I've come to find out that the &quot; Rest of the world said the Hell with
ME!!&quot; Well that is just Great I say to myself. Nobody gives a shit anymore
because I never gave a shit throughout my drunkeness. So here I am all alone and
lost everything with nowhere to go except &quot;UP Or Down&quot;. I chose UP.
<p>
These are trying times for many of us considering the dismal job markets and
ever increasing inavasion of our rights and privacy. Doing some research I have
found sites that claim 1 out of 53 Americans are either on parole, probation or
are incarcerated. How did this country end up in this situation, what is the
real motive behind all of this social restructuring?? What will be the end
result?? I question these objectives constantly within my mind. I find it all to
be very disturbing.
<p>
But dispite all of this and all of my misgivings I made up my mind and through my
own willpower decided to change my own course in life. So far I'm doing O.K. with
sobriety and have no desire to resume any self induced misery through the use of
alcohol. I have a certain amount of empathy for people that struggle to give up
alcohol and can't seem to do it. But then in some ways I don't . In my way of
thinking I believe that all of us have more control over our lives than could be
realized. I do not believe some magic dark secret formula or hideous ritual will
magically transform us into a sane level thinking productive member of society.
For some reason within my encounters I have witnessed a lot of people who believe
in this religous mockery(AA). It saddens me as it also angers me for the fact the
justice system has condemned me to 2 yrs of this relentless unforgiving
ritualistic madness.
<p>
<a name="suicide"> </a>
Back to willpower, what irks me is the number of so-called members of AA who
relapse. The number of so called EX-members who committed sucide or died drinking
on a binge. The living members just admit it to the group of their relapse like
naughty children and remorsefully accept their punishment of having to start all
over again and relinquishing their 2, 5, or whatever year chips. Then I get to
witness the rest of the group applaud him or her and say, &quot;Welcome back, just
keep coming&quot;. Are these people freaking blind, brain dead or just outright
stupid? Since attending these court ordered quagmires I have been privy to at
least 4 or 5 suicides or deaths because of drinking group members. Now I am not
in a big city, it is a smaller county on the map. These incidents I have
witnessed are alarming to say the least. With these kind of statistics in a
small backwater county like the one I'm in, what does that render of the rest of
the country?
<p>
I am also taken aback at how readily the rest of the group shuns others if they
don't see and conform to their narrow-minded one-way belief system. Watching
these people carry around the so-called &quot;big book&quot; the book of wisdom, knowledge
and salvation, makes my guts turn. I don't know how much more of these meetings I
can stomach before I blow a gasket. But I will use my own self-found WILLPOWER
to abstain from unwarranted behavior on my part, it just ain't worth it. Besides
trying to seek real truth and expression within a group of people set in the
ways of the &quot;big book&quot; is totally fruitless as we all too well know.
<p>
Anyways I just thought I'd drop you a line and say Hi and thanks for your work.
Life feels better every day sober, I love it and wish and  hope I can help others
as the ocassions arise. There are people that did not give up on me through all
my misfortune and I feel I should also do the same.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
 BRIAN

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Brian,
<p>
Thanks for a bright and cheery letter. It really is, you know. It's nice to hear about anyone
who is making it. So congratulations on your sobriety, and especially congratulations for getting
your head straightened out and seeing which way is up.
<p>
One line that you wrote particularly rang a bell for me, where you were talking about other people
trying to keep you from drinking, and how you resisted such oppression. I can sympathize with that.
Such attempts at control never worked on me either. The moment of truth for me was the realization
that other people were totally irrelevant in the equations &#8212; that simple bad health was going to
kill me if I continued to drink.
It had nothing to do with other people or what they wanted or what they demanded.
It was all about me either getting healthy
or dying. That is what did it for me. I chose to live.

<p>
So have a good day, and a good life now.

Subject:  	Re: stumbled on your web site<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
I am motivated to reply as it's obvious you have little knowledge
of the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. You have made some gross and
generalized criticisms of AA without really studying it. You probably
attended quite a few bad fellowship meetings and might have read the
book through once or twice, then made your angered conclusions.
Incidentally the first 164 pages of the AA big book are meant to be
studied.  So I will take one of your replies and rebute it and in
doing so will hopefully correctly inform you of the program of
Alcohlics Anonymous which unfortunately even many people in the
fellowship of Alcholics Anonymous do not have a clear understanding.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again Chris,
<p>
Actually, I have studied A.A. a great deal, and attended more than a few 12-Step meetings.
Read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction</a>
 and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">the bibliography</a>.

</font>
<p>
Also it's clear to me you do not even understand what alcoholism is.
Alcoholism by definition is the suffers complete inability to stop
drinking on their own willpower. Alcoholics cannot control their
drinking. After the first drink alcoholics develop a phenomenon of
craving which overwelms them and they keep on drinking to inibriation.
Non-alcoholics can have a few and put it down. Heavy drinkers when
give a sufficient reason to stop, maybe by their Dr., employer or
wife, will stop on there own or moderate. Alcoholics even after dire
news from the Dr, employer or wife to quit will keep on drinking. They
are powerless. Alcoholism is a mental obsession coupled witha physical
allergy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Unfortunately, I do understand &quot;what alcoholism is&quot;. Been there, done that.
<p>
You are just parrotting some more A.A. dogma, like that alcoholics cannot control their drinking.
The medical evidence and experimental results show that they can and do.
And the vast majority of alcoholics who quit drinking for a year or more do it alone, on their own,
without a &quot;support group&quot; or &quot;treatment&quot;.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Medical School
said that</a>, and they know
a lot more about alcoholism than Bill Wilson did.
<p>
You could also try reading <a href="#Fingarette">Herbert Fingarette's book
<i>Heavy Drinking: The Myth of Alcoholism as a Disease</i></a>.
He does a good job of disposing of the myth that alcoholics are powerless over alcohol.

</font>
<p>
Another thing I will point out that you may not understand is that
there are two AA's. One is the program of AA and the other is the
fellowship. They are two separate things and nowhere in the literature
does it say that meetings are required to stay sober.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Nope, I'm not buying that &quot;two A.A.s&quot; argument. It's all A.A.
</font>
<p>
Here is my rebute of your first reply.

<p>

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
You have made a gross error to conclude AA offers a cure of alcohlism.
AA does not. Alcoholism cannot be cured. There is no medical evidence
there is a cure for alcholism. A cure for alcoholism would mean after
a cure therapy, whatever it may be, that an alcoholic could drink
normally. The medical  community  (the honest part at least, not the
quick buck recovery and fly by night quacks) will be the first to
admite they have no successful treatment that allows chronic
alcoholics to one day drink like a non-alcoholic. AA only offers a
relief and sustained absitence from alcohol. No where in the literate
will you find that it claims to cure alcohlism, It simply offers a way
to sustain absitance. It does not offer a way to control drinking (
which real alcoholics cannot do) and it does not offer a cure.

<p>
So, I'll leave you with this to show you are in error.

<p>
<a name="solution"> </a>
Show me anywhere in the first 164 pages of the big book or the entire
12 and 12 where AA says it offers a &quot;cure&quot; for alcohlism. It offers
recovery and relief which are not the same thing as being cured.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is quibbling and word games.
No, Bill Wilson did not use the word &quot;cure&quot; in the <i>Big Book</i>.
 He used the word &quot;solution&quot;.
Same difference.

Bill Wilson was most assuredly claiming to have a &quot;solution&quot; to the problem of alcohol addiction.
He did not want to use the word &quot;cure&quot; because that might imply that alcoholics could
finish recovering and be like normal
people, and live without Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Bill Wilson's &quot;solution to alcoholism&quot; was permanent membership in his cult.
<p>
I reject your definition of &quot;cure&quot;. You are trying to define a cure as making alcoholics able
to drink alcohol like normal people. That is a peculiar definition that is disconnected from reality.
The truth is that quitting drinking and regaining one's health is a cure for alcohol abuse. 
It is not necessary for ex-alcoholics to be able to drink moderately.
Living sober and healthy is good enough. I know.
<p>
It's just like some guy who eats a horrible diet and gets no exercise, and is a total couch
potato, living on TV and beer and potato chips and pizza and football games, until he has a heart attack.
The doctor saves his life and gets him on a strict diet and exercise regimen, and the guy
recovers his health and starts living.
Are you going to try to claim that the guy was not &quot;cured&quot; of his
cardiac condition because he cannot return to a life of TV and junk food without risking another heart
attack?
<p>
It's a very peculiar definition of &quot;cure&quot; to claim that the 
patient is not &quot;cured&quot; because he cannot return to the bad habits 
that made him sick in the first place.
That's about as dumb as insisting that there is no cure for heroin addiction, because a recovered
heroin addict cannot go back to shooting heroin moderately, like normal people.
<p>
Permanently quitting drinking and developing a positive, balanced, lifestyle is most assuredly
a good cure for alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction.
<p>
I notice that you totally dodged
<a href="orange-letters200.html#success_rate" target="_blank">the point of the A.A. death rate,
and relapse rate, and increased rate of binge drinking</a>.
You can't disavow all bad A.A. results just by repeating a slogan
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;A.A. does not claim to have a cure.&quot;</font>
A.A. is still responsible for the harm done to the patients.

</font>
<p>
I fear sir that you have made gross and general criticisms from a
place of small peripheral knowledge of the program of Alcoholics
Anonymous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Nope. Where do you think that I over-generalized?
</font>
<p>
If there was ever a cure for alcoholism it would be headline news and
one of the greatest medical break throughs of humanity.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is no &quot;cure&quot; for &quot;the disease of alcoholism&quot; because there is no
 such &quot;disease&quot; as &quot;alcoholism&quot;.

Alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction are caused by everything from childhood trauma to
mental illnesses like bipolar disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is no simple, easy, single cause
for drug and alcohol misuse, so there is
also no easy cure. And membership in a cult religion has certainly not
worked as a &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;a solution&quot; to any of those problems.

<p>
Orance, I decided to re-read your letter sir. Well, my overall
conclusion is that you have a problem with God and spirituality. You
also probably do not believe that a Higher Power exists. So no amount
of back and forth emails will convince you of that unless you become
alcoholic and get desperate enough to try the 12 steps for yourself.
Reading the big book is one thing, studying it and followying the
instructions inside is what will give relief from the disease in the
form of abstiance from alcohol.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you don't know what you are talking about. You think you figured out my religion by
just reading a few lines of one letter, and now you are pretty sure that I'm an atheist or agnostic,
huh? What an easy cop-out. 
<p>
I will tell you this about my religious beliefs: I do not believe in Santa Claus, and I do not believe
in Cinderella's Fairy Godmother, and I don't believe in Aladdin and his Magic Lamp.
You cannot get your problems solved by begging a ghost or spirit to do favors for you.
(Consider how well that worked for the Jews in Auschwitz.)

<p>
Your claim that I must &quot;try the 12 Steps for myself&quot; before 
I can understand them is
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">typical cult fare</a>.
Cults routinely claim that only they understand the Special Knowledge 
that the cult has to offer,
but if you just try their chanting/prayer/yoga/meditation/program for 
a year, then you will understand.
The truth is, if you try their mind-bending cult practices for a year,
you will become so brainwashed that you will believe all of their crazy
nonsense.

</font>
<p>
Funny that you think you know better than I what has given me 17+
years of sobriety. You are convinced I did it myself. That it was I
who just &quot;decided&quot; to stop drinking. Do you know how many times I
tried to stop drinking by saying to myself &quot;never again&quot;. at least 20
times over a period of 3 years. Each time making the decision to stop
and trying to carry it through failed. When I was finally desperate
enough I asked for help in a meeting of AA. And got it in the form of
a good sponsor who took me through the steps, it was then that I
actually tried AA. I got results and permanent ones so far.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The fact that you had difficulties quitting drinking does not prove or even indicate that
a ghost did big favors for you.
What you are implying but not saying out loud is that the &quot;A.A. program
worked&quot; by God doing things for you.

</font>
<p>
 I had been
to treatment centers and oh yes I had more than a few stern one hour
talking too's by family, friends and Doctors all telling me I was
going to die. That kind of &quot;therapy&quot; is enough for a heavy drinker who
is not alcoholic but for a real alcoholic like me it did NO GOOD. So,
again I believe you have a misunderstanding of what alcoholism really
is. You are mistaking alcoholism for heavy drinking. Are you even
alcoholic? I wonder. Probably just a heavy drinker who just needed a
good reason to stop. You say you operate this website because you
think AA is a crime. How can seeking God for help in something be a
crime. AA is no big deal. You are making mountains out of mole hills.
AA is not a religion. It does not promise a cure. It just says that if
one is willing to do the 12 steps which are very spiritual in nature (
making amends and cleaning house in ones life etc..) that one will be
given freedom from alcoholism by a God of ones own understanding. I
was aethieast before AA, but there was no where else to turn. I was
pennyless as most alcoholics are in the final stages and free AA was
there and worked. No sir, I did not quit by my own accord it was
throught doing 12 steps that I got a connection with a higher power
that did it for me. I was powerless and after doing the steps found a
power greater than myself who solved my problem.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The fact that treatment didn't work on you just goes to show that treatment does not work.
<p>
Your description of your difficulties quitting show that you expected somebody to do something
for you. You expected their &quot;program to work&quot;, and make you quit drinking. It doesn't work that way.
You finally quit drinking when you decided for real not to put any more alcohol in your mouth.
<p>
On your other claims:
<ul>
<p><li> Yes,
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">A.A. is a religion</a>,
and a bad one at that. Read
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>.


<p><li> A.A. does promise a &quot;solution&quot;, a &quot;non-cure cure&quot; that
requires permanent cult membership.
<p><li> Your attempt to divide alcoholics into &quot;heavy drinkers&quot; and &quot;real alcoholics&quot; is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy" target="_blank">false dichotomy</a>.
In A.A. dogma, those who quit drinking without devoting their lives to the A.A. cult were merely
&quot;heavy drinkers&quot;, while those who joined A.A. were &quot;the real alcoholics&quot;.
That is just a lame attempt to claim that A.A. is essential for some people. Not so. 

<p><li> You did quit on your own accord. The 12 Steps didn't do it for you.
The 12 Steps are just <a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">old pro-Nazi cult religion garbage</a>
from the nineteen-thirties.<br>
Would you care to explain how
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's cult religion practices</a>
make alcoholics quit drinking alcohol?

<p><li> Your vague &quot;power greater than myself&quot; supposedly did you big favors, huh? What did you pay Him with?
Do you imagine that &quot;God&quot; is your butler and works for free? What is the magic trick that gets God
to be your servant and wait on you hand and foot and make you quit drinking when He never did before?

<p><li> You were not powerless. You just didn't know how to use your power.
And then you learned not to put any more alcohol in your mouth, and started using some of your God-given
will power. Congratulations on your years of sobriety. You did it. Nobody did it for you.

<p><li> I notice that you are trying to have it both ways. At the start of your letters, you tried
to explain away the horrible A.A. track record &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">increased death rate</a>,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increased binge drinking</a>,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">
increased costs of hospitalization</a> &#8212; by declaring (paraphrased),
<font color="black">
 &quot;A.A. does not claim to have a cure for alcoholism. The word 'cure' is not in the Big Book.&quot;
</font>
But now at the end of your letters, you claim that,
<font color="black">
&quot;free AA was there and worked.&quot;
</font>
Well either A.A. does work, or it doesn't. You can't have it both ways.
If A.A. really makes alcoholics quit drinking and get healthy, then that is a cure.
You are claiming that A.A. does have
a working cure, even while you claim that A.A. does not have a cure.
That is illogical, to put it mildly.

Hello A Orange,

<p>
Have been reading the orange-papers. Very interesting material. When did you do this
reasearch and  how long did
it take? Why did you decide to research this topic? Are you planning a book?

<p>
I've been in AA a couple of times. This last time for 6 years. There really seem to
be alot of sick people there.

<p>
Is there more info from people who were involved in AA during the early years who
were critical of the organization?

<p>
Nice work

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kent,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. I've been learning about A.A., and writing about it, for almost 10 years
now. (And I've also been sober for just a little longer than that, too.)
The how and whys of the web site are explained here:
<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="newwin59">Who are you?</a>,
and here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#who_r_u" target="newwin159">How did you get to be where you are?</a>.

<p>
I'm still thinking about publishing the web site in book form. And what I think is,
&quot;It sounds like a lot of work, and maybe unnecessary.&quot;

<p>
When you ask about,
<font color="black">
 &quot;people who were involved in AA during the early years who
were critical of the organization&quot;</font>,
that is problematic. If you mean the real early years, like 1939 and 1940, when
A.A. was organized and the <i>Big Book</i>
was published, well, they are almost all dead of old age.
Anybody who was 39 years old in 1939 would be 110 years old now.
So surviving old-timers are as rare as hen's teeth. I hear that there are still a few alive,
but very few.
<p>
However, I don't know of any surviving skeptics. A.A. does not publicize those people.
They tend to just disappear and are never mentioned by A.A. again.
They become &quot;non-persons&quot; in the Stalinist sense.

<p>
If you mean writings or documents from those skeptical old-timers, there are a few. Clarence Snyder
comes to mind as one of the first. He was very opposed to Bill Wilson's financial dishonesty.
A letter from Clarence Snyder is
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
(Incidentally, Clarence Snyder is becoming a non-person too. His story was in the first three editions
of the <i>Big Book</i>, but the A.A. headquarters staff removed
Clarence's story from the fourth edition. Clarence Snyder will now be forgotten for having criticized
Bill Wilson.)

<p>
And then there are:
<ul>
<li> 
<a href="orange-Henrietta_Seiberling.html" target="_blank">
A very critical letter from Henrietta Seiberling, the woman who introduced Bill Wilson to Dr. Bob</a>.

<li> <a href="orange-ahcain.html" target="newwin8716">Dr. Arthur H. Cain: First <i>Harper's</i> and <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> articles critical of A.A.</a>

<li> <a href="orange-pamphlet2.html" target="_blank">A pamphlet by A.A. members, criticizing the leadership</a>

Dear friend at Orange Papers,

<p>
I was just browsing your site and thought I would pass along a URL that the
readers of your website might find particularly informative. My name is
David Harris and I am the Communications Director for Mesothelioma Symptoms.
<p>
We have an excellent resource for you to take a look at today<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005229/http://www.mesotheliomasymptoms.com/" target="_blank">
http://www.mesotheliomasymptoms.com</a>
<p>
The Mesothelioma Symptoms site covers a
range of topics from the different forms of mesothelioma, the hard to detect
symptoms, and the various methods of treatment.

<p>
Mesothelioma is diagnosed to over 3,000 people each year and it is
considered one of the most deadliest forms of cancer in the world.
Mesothelioma, in most cases, is caused by exposure to asbestos.

<p>
I see that your links page &#8212;

<a href="orange-links.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-links.html</a><br>

has a number of health and safety related websites designed to inform your
viewers and readers about healthy living. I would be very grateful if you
would share our site with your visitors on your links page. Our goal is to
receive a single text link to Mesothelioma Symptoms. Please let me know if
this information exchange is of interest to you.

<p>
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>
Thanks again,

Hello Rich,
<p>
Once again, a critic who does not even know
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context" target="_blank">what it means to quote out of context</a>
 tries to
dismiss all negative information about Alcoholics Anonymous with a sweeping slur.
(Click on that link and learn what quoting out of context means.)
<p>
Quoting out of context is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context">a debating or propaganda trick</a>
where you extract a few words in a manner that changes the meaning of what you are quoting.
<!--  (<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context">Look here</a>.) -->

Just quoting things isn't &quot;quoting out of context&quot;.

<p>
I do not quote out of context. I am very careful about that. I often quote entire paragraphs or
even entire pages so that the context will be there.

<p>
I challenge you to show me any quote where I took something out of the <i>Big Book</i> or other
&quot;council-approved literature&quot; and quoted it out of context in a way that changed its meaning.

<p>
<font color="black">
&quot;ATTRACTION RATHER THAN PROMOTION!&quot;</font> is hypocritical bullshit.
 Alcoholics Anonymous has always been a program
of self-promotion. Bill Wilson even rationalized his promotion of A.A. by saying,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Jack_Alexander" target="_blank">
&quot;Good publicity does not manufacture itself.&quot;</a>

<p>
And A.A. is not only a program of self-promotion, A.A. is even a program of coercive recruiting.
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">The last two triennial surveys of A.A. have shown</a>
that nearly two-thirds of all of the A.A.  members were forced, pressured,
or coerced into A.A. by judges, parole officers, &quot;therapists&quot;
and &quot;counselors&quot;, employers, or families and friends.

Subject:  	Thanks a lot, from the very bottom of my heart<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
First of all, I want to thank you once again for your dedication, hard
work and true insight. Your web site has been a life-saver for me, in
the sense that I sort of already knew that there was something
fundamentally wrong with the Program, but I was told back then that my
resistance to &quot;surrender&quot; was due to my &quot;disease&quot;. Unfortunately, I
bought that idea, and ended up being so brain-washed that I began
pushing my friends and family away; I started having really bizarre
nightmares, which my sponsor said was all okay, because that was my
disease just fighting to grab a hold in me. Finally, I relapsed. And
boy, did I relapse. I almost killed myself, by not eating anything for
a month, I only ingested vodka in surrealistic quantities. I got in
detox, and that was the single most painful time in my entire life.
When I stopped having physical withdrawal symptoms, I become very much
suicidal, 'cause my sponsor had told me that I didn't need my doctor
prescribed anti-depressants. I was in horrible pain, re-initiated my
medical treatment and then went into substance abuse treatment.
Fortunately, it wasn't an AA-based treatment center. They used
cognitive behavioral therapy, and their approach was based on
scientific research, not superstition. I found your site by googling
&quot;aa brainwashing&quot;, because when I came to my senses, I realized that I
was indeed brainwashed, which is really scaring, since I'm a bright
guy, and like you, I have always wanted to know everything there is to
know. Of course, that is impossible, but I'm just fundamentally curious
or philosophical in my way of thinking.

<p>
I must admit that I'm still struggling with blind hatred and utter
bitterness towards my ex-sponsor, who consistently encouraged me to
drink even more, after I relapsed. He would say things like: Go and
get a bottle of vodka, do it. And then afterwards explaining to me
that I needed to hit rock bottom, in order to surrender. I find that
approach sadistic, and I wonder how many people he's in fact killing by
encouraging them to kill themselves even faster.

<p>
I find almost everything on your web site spot-on, however, there is a
minor detail which sort of bugs me: You claim that NA is &quot;just the
same as AA&quot; and their success rate is probably the same as for AA.
That seems to me like pure speculation, since you do not back that
conjecture up with any kind of documentation. Now, I will not defend
NA, but I would just want to point out that, although their steps are
pretty much similar to the AA steps, their way of actually doing them
differs tremendously from the Big Book approach. Their way of
practicing the steps seems mere therapeutic, and not as ego-deflating
as the AA way. Now, I know nothing about the effectiveness of NA, so I
won't accuse them of anything, I can mildly bear over with cult
religion, as long as it works. I know AA doesn't work, and NA probably
doesn't either, but I would give NA the benefit of the doubt, since I
haven't been able to find a single, valid study to back up my
gut-feeling about them.

<p>
Thank you once again, and have a good day.

Hello Mikael,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. And thank you for all of the compliments. I'm glad to hear that
your are doing well, and really recovering now.
<p>
 And your English is really quite good. In fact, it's better than what
I get from a lot of Steppers, who supposedly speak English as their native language.
<p>
About the success rate of Narcotics Anonymous: You are right, I am speculating and projecting,
and assuming things. I have to, because I don't have any properly-done surveys
or clinical tests that tested Narcotics
Anonymous and formally established the success rate.
<p>
I do however, have a bunch of personal experience. When I was going to 12-Step meetings,
I went to both A.A. and N.A. a lot. I divided my time between them pretty equally.
And I lived with a lot of recovering addicts.  And the failure rate was terrible.
<p>
After two years of recovery, one of the counselors told me that I was the ONLY person who did not
relapse, out of my whole &quot;class&quot; in the treatment program, which was about 200 people.
One out of 200. That isn't much of a success rate. (By the way, the &quot;treatment&quot; was based on
A.A. and N.A. meetings.)

<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

Subject:  	Wow!<br>

<p>
It's been quite some time since I have seriously browsed your website.

<p>
After spending a few hours on it today, I had to write this to tell you:

<p>
WOW! What a collection of info! Was amazed to find so much documentation!

<p>
For many years, my rants on a.r.aa were the only internet documentation of
Tom Powers involvement in writing the 12&amp;12. Now it's all been researched
and verified by you!

<p>
<a name="Family_Foundation"> </a>
I especially like the section on the Teen Gulags.  One place you might want
to add to your research is the Family Foundation School, which is a twelve
step/4 absolutes based boarding school for troubled teens.

<p>
&quot;The founders of The Family Foundation School were heavily influenced by
Alcoholics Anonymous and the Oxford Group. Today the 12 Steps of AA and the
Four Absolutes of the Oxford Group are taught in our living skills classes
and serve as a touch-stone for decision-making at all levels of the
organization.&quot;

is a site critical of them.

<p>
Has had close ties with Tom Powers' East Ridge group in the past. Many staff
had come from Tom's group originally.

Keep up the awesome work!

Hello Sean,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And thanks for your dedication to the cause.

<p>
That child-abusing &quot;family school&quot; is a nightmare.
 I hope the so-called &quot;counselors&quot; go to prison for child abuse.
The second link, the critical one, is especially good. And heartbreaking.
<p>
When I read stories where a girl talks about how the &quot;counselors&quot; constantly put the children
down and made them feel bad about themselves, I know that those kids are really getting harmed
and crippled for the rest of their lives. That kind of mental abuse does not just go away.
The kids come out of it with permanent inferiority complexes. When they need to negotiate for
wages with their boss, they won't dare to request what they are really worth, because they
think that an inferior person like them is lucky to have a job at all.
When it comes to choosing a mate, they will think, &quot;A beautiful person like him/her wouldn't
want to pair up with a loser like me, so there is no sense in even trying. I'll settle for a
slob that I don't really like, because that's all that somebody like me can get.&quot;
And then there will be drug and alcohol problems as those kids, grown to adults, try to fix
what is broken and feel okay.

<p>
A friend of mine had a very radical attitude about child abusers: He said that we should just
kill them. For the first offense. When you add up the total damage to society that child abuse
causes, it is staggering. Half of the people in prison for violent crimes were abused children.
About half of the hard-core alcoholics and drug addicts were abused children.
So when you find somebody who is guilty of child abuse, just execute him on the spot.

<p>
I have a hard time disagreeing with him.
<p>
Have a good day now.
