Hi Terrance,
<p>
I just read this paper by the World Health Organization in Europe which
states that both 12 Step facilitation and Alcoholics Anonymous are
ineffective!

<p>
I've extracted the relevant parts and added it as a pdf.

Hello again, iamnotastatistic,

Thanks for the information.

I found these lines interesting:

Although Project MATCH found a significant positive impact of treatment and no differences in
outcome between 12-step facilitation therapy designed to help patients become
engaged in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, a 12-session cognitive
behavioural therapy designed to teach patients coping skills to prevent a relapse
into drinking, and a motivational enhancement therapy designed to increase
motivation for and commitment to change (132), the mesa-grand study found
evidence of ineffectiveness of 12-step facilitation from 6 studies and of
ineffectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous from 7 studies (109). An additional
systematic review of 8 studies found no studies that unequivocally
demonstrated the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous or 12-step facilitation
approaches for reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems (133).

First off, the very first sentence there is incorrect. Oh, the WHO report is correct.
They correctly reported misinformation.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH" target="_blank">The guys who ran
Project MATCH are still making groundless claims of success</a>.
(See their web site for more lies.)
They conducted a very badly designed and run study <i>without any control group</i>
that cherry-picked which patients went into which
treatment group, and then they paid the patients to &quot;keep coming back&quot;, and then they got muddled results where
nothing worked any better than anything else, and then they crowed that &quot;treatment works!&quot;.
But without an untreated control group, they do not know what, if anything, worked better than no treatment
at all. Project MATCH was just a waste of $26 million.
It proved nothing other than the fact that incompetents who aren't
really looking for the truth can waste a lot of money.
(Also see
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#MATCH" target="_blank">this documentation, where the Project MATCH leaders
actually declared</a>
that a goal of the so-called &quot;Twelve-Step Facilitation&quot; was to make the
patients <i>believe that A.A. is the only way</i>.)

<p><li>
The first citation, by Prof. William R. Miller, is from a real expert in the field.
He is either the leader or one of the leaders (I'm not sure which) of the Center
for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology, University of
New Mexico at Albuquerque. And near as I can make out, Professor Reid K. Hester
is also a leading light there. They have done a number of studies and books together.
The two of them are famous for their studies of alcoholism and what works as treatment.
And what they have found does not please the 12-Step crowd, or the &quot;12-Step treatment industry&quot; racket.
They have found that 12-Step treatment is one of the <i>least</i> effective ways of treating
alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction. (What else could you expect? How can cult religion be a &quot;treatment&quot;
for a &quot;disease&quot;?)

<p><ol>
<li>
Professors Reid K. Hester and William R. Miller rated treatment modalities by success rate.
Here are the results:<br>

http://www.addictioninfo.org/articles/53/1/What-works-A-summary-of-alcohol-treatment-research/Page1.html</a><br>
== The same statistics in a different format
</ul>
<p>
The most successful treatment is &quot;Brief Intervention&quot;.<br>
<p>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.
And A.A. is just below that.
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.
<p>
&quot;Brief Intervention&quot; consists of a real doctor talking to the
patient for usually less than one hour, questioning him about all of the
ugly details of his drinking and telling him that he will die if he doesn't
quit drinking.  One time.
That's it. No long counseling sessions, no great guidance, no on-going
advice, no shoulder to cry on. And no 28-day treatment program.
Just one &quot;Dutch Uncle&quot; session and it's over.
And that's the most effective thing going.
<p>
That kind of puts the whole expensive &quot;drug-and-alcohol treatment
industry&quot; to shame, doesn't it?

<p><li>
A researcher at that UNM center wrote telling me about a study of &quot;spiritual healing&quot;
that they did that found that such &quot;treatment&quot; does not work at all.

In spite of their hefty academic credentials, they have written a non-technical
book that is loaded with practical advice. And they clearly leave the
total-abstinence/moderation question up to you.  And they have a bunch of
techniques for reducing your drinking, rather than just totally quitting.
<p>
<blockquote>
Prof. Miller's biography (on the back of his book <i>Controlling Your Drinking</i>), says:
<blockquote>
Prof. William R. Miller is Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the

Interviewing</i>, a modern classic in the field of addiction treatment. Dr. Miller's research,
which focuses on providing a broader and more effective range of treatment approaches

the international Jellinek Memorial Award for excellence in alcoholism research.

<p><li>
The last citation from that WHO article refers to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
They have some pretty heavy condemnation of 12-Step treatment too:
<p>
<blockquote>

the <i>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i> that criticized previous pro-A.A. articles
&#8212; articles that claimed good results for A.A. &#8212; 
for many failings like bad math, no control group, mixed teachings (teaching 12-Step superstitions in
CBT courses), cherry picking, self-reporting, and unrealistic environments. See:
<a href="orange-letters247.html#Clark_M" target="_blank">orange-letters247.html#Clark_M</a>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, the 12-Step proselytizers ignore all such evidence and continue to chant,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;A.A. is the best way. A.A. is the only way. Work the Steps or Die!&quot;</font>

And that is why it's a cult, not a cure.

From:  	&quot;Michael H.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	very interesting stuff<br>

<p>
Dear Orange-

<p>
I've been sober 6 years via A.A. but have many reservations about if, how
and why it works. Although I am completely agnostic in spiritual matters, I
seem to cling to this fear that if I leave A.A. I will drink one day. Now,
this fear isn't totally irrational given my track record. I have been in
and out of A.A. for years before finally sticking to it and staying sober.
There seemed to be a direct correlation between attending meetings and
staying sober. Believe me, I never wanted to go to meetings (and still
don't) but I am convinced they help. I first got sober for five years
through A.A. I stopped going to meetings and within 9 months I drank. Then
I stayed sober a year while going to A.A. I stopped going to meetings and
was drunk within 6 months. And a third time I stayed sober a year through
meetings, stopped again and was drunk within 3 months. I consider myself a
reasonable guy. I believe in modern science. But his correlation from my
own real world testing has convinced me to keep going to meetings. I
sometimes even strike it up to superstition. I am not above admitting this.

<p>
I am part of a home group that has seen and experienced the low success
rate. It seems over the past 6 years only about 20 &#8212; 30% of us are still
sober. I am not refuting your 5% rate but am simply providing my
observation from one meeting that averages about 40 in size in the past
year.

<p>
I don't believe in a higher power but I do believe the companionship and
sharing with like-minded people suffering from the same issue is helpful
and has played a major role in my recovery. Of course I happened to find a
group of cynical, sarcastic and profane alcoholics like myself who like to
poke fun at the &quot;put the plug in the jug&quot; true believers.

<p>
One other interesting facet is that I also suffer form bipolar disorder II.
So I do take meds and my sponsor has told me go for it and he's on
anti-depressants anyway.  I think alcoholism and BPD are natural companions
(the booze quieting the screaming madness if you will). But the AA pals I
hang with are also manic-depressive, neurotic and &quot;deep&quot; (depraved). So I
think the AA group I hang with helps address both of my disorders in one
fell swoop. So, at the end of the day, it might be the placebo effect but I
think in my unique situation I have found a formula that is truly
therapeutic. For the first time in my life I actually enjoy the meetings
too (okay, mostly the fellowship afterwards).

<p>
My overall point is that I don't disagree with the facts you have presented
(how could one). Yet there are also some of us that may have benefited from
the program. I am not sure if I would stay sober without it. There is
something to that feeling of anticipation that heals as well. Something to
look forward to. (Or as my sponsor says the &quot;shit, i can't relapse I gotta
make the coffee on Tuesday).

<p>
Just some random thoughts from a cynical bastard who thinks A.A. works if
you find the right mix &#8212; which is NOT easy.

<p>
Mike

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your years of sobriety.
I also think you sound like a reasonable guy. You seem
to be happy with your support group, so enjoy. Have a good time. That's okay.
Especially when you aren't drinking the koolaid. You don't have to leave.
In fact, you sound like a good candidate for membership in
<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">the Newcomer Rescue League</a>.

<p>
About your fear of leaving: That is normal. A.A. induces a lot of fears and phobias, all intended
to make people stay in the group and obey the commandments (&quot;Work the Steps&quot;), and
believe what they are saying. Of course they want you to believe that you are sober because of
A.A. (rather than by your own efforts and self-reliance and determination), and that you will die if you leave A.A.
That is just standard cult practice. Here are the Cult Test items for that:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank">Question 34. The Cult Implants Phobias.</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">Answer 34. The Cult Implants Phobias.</a>
</ol>
<p>
By the way, the fact that you relapsed when you quit going to A.A. meetings is
probably not a coincidence.  You probably quit going to A.A. meetings at about
the same time as your resolve to stay sober wavered. Quite possibly, you started
to feel depressed and you thought that the whole routine wasn't worth the bother
any more, and you just wanted to feel good and have some fun, so you quit going
to A.A. meetings and started drinking again at about the same time, for the same
reason. Thus both the relapse and quitting A.A. were caused by a common underlying
reason. It wasn't a matter of not going to A.A. meetings causes people to drink.
<p>
(And my evidence for that is that I now have 11 years sober, and haven't been to an
A.A. meeting in 10 years.)
<p>
By the way, giving the credit to A.A. sounds like the logical fallacy of
<i>False Attribution</i>, and also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>
 &#8212; giving the credit for a good thing to something that actually had little
or nothing to do with it. Like A.A. promoters are quite happy to talk about how
A.A. members are much healthier and more clear-headed now that they aren't drinking,
and they can keep a job now and they have money in their pockets, and they don't
get arrested as often, and on and on, and then they conclude that A.A. has really
benefited the members immensely. Actually, no. Quitting drinking alcohol caused
all of those good things, not A.A. The A.A. meetings and theology didn't do any
of it.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
I just stumbled across your &quot;Orange Papers.&quot; Wow.

<p>
What has made you so angry and bitter at AA? And at the idea of God, for that matter?

<p>
I've been a member of AA for 29 years, and I can assure you it is not a cult. No one
lured me to AA, I went (and stayed) of my own choosing. I still have contact with my
family and am a productive member of society. I don't live in a commune, sleep with
the leader (or as a leader, sleep with new members), break the law in the name of
AA, or give all my money to it. People in AA do not control me &#8212; some misguided
members may try, but they soon find out it doesn't work.

<p>
In fact, it is because of AA that I have better relationships with my family
members, am a law-abiding citizen, can hold down a good job and am responsible and
accountable for my actions.

<p>
I'd be willing to have a reasonable discourse with you at any time on this subject.

Hello Jackie,

Thanks for the letter, and I'd also be happy to have a reasonable discord, any time.

You are suffering from one big misimpression: I am not angry at God. I have no quarrel with God.
I know full well that God and Alcoholics Anonymous have very little to do with each other.
God did not have a hand in writing the crazy theology of Alcoholics Anonymous,

Hello Virgorich,

I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the information. But &quot;contaminated&quot;? I go out of my way to

good documentation. Check out

<p>
Now I agree that I am not a neutral, disinterested, observer. I feel a lot of contempt for the criminals and con

Those sick people are my friends and acquaintances, and I care. But I don't allow my emotions to get the best of
me. I won't falsify data or fabricate lies to support my position, the way that the 12-Step racket does.

Hello Matt,

I criticize A.A. because it has not &quot;saved thousands of lives&quot;. A.A. is a fraud that just lies about

http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-intro.html</a>

<p>
Dear A. Orange,

<p>
I have some real problems about your cynical treatise on AA in the
introduction page.<br>
Alcoholics and drug addicts suffer years of mental delusion even years after
stopping drinking and/or taking drugs.<br>
The AA 12 steps saved my soul.<br>
It is not a cult.<br>
The Big Book of AA was divinely inspired.<br>
A cult is usually a misguided group of followers who devote their lives,
spirit, money, anything they have, to a guru or leader. The cult is often
marked by the leader leading his followers over a cliff.<br>
Think, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Charles Manson, Marshal Applewhite (Heaven's
Gate) and the like.<br>
AA bears no resemblance to these leaders and their cults.<br>
AA asks you to put a buck in the basket IF YOU CAN SPARE IT for coffee and
rent for the church for the meeting space.<br>

<p>
I did my 12 step work in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The meetings were
no nonsense, no bullshit noise pollution.<br>
I do agree with you that there is a lot of nonsense. But the AA Big Book
meetings I did my 12 step work with are disciplined and they teach you to
grow up and stop blaming your problems on AA or other people. I knew many
people who would otherwise be dead.  I also knew of other people who left
and turned their backs on God and died, sometimes by suicide.

<p>
People at Big Book step study meetings are not allowed to talk unless they
had completed at least the 5th step. The steps are done according to the way
they are laid out in the big book.

<p>
If people do not recover it is not because of AA. It says clearly in the big
book MOST CHRONIC ALCOHOLICS ARE DOOMED. That is telling the truth. In large
part it is because people will not get honest with themselves.

<p>
The book recounts an experience of Dr. Carl Jung who told a patient he was
an alcoholic of the hopeless variety. But Dr. Jung also told him that once
in a while alcoholics of the hopeless variety have a &quot;religious&quot; experience
that leads them to recovery.

<p>
Bill Wilson even solicited money from the Rockefeller Foundation. After
thinking about it, Rockefeller turned him down because he thought money
would corrupt the good that AA was doing.

<p>
Just like anything else, you get out of AA what you put in to it.

<p>
*** MOST IMPORTANT *** AA is not a place you GO but a thing you DO.

<p>
It works, it really does. It gave me peace and solace. I finally got humble
enough to do the 12 steps as they're laid out in the Big Book after an
incident where I was charged by the police for trying to take out revenge on
someone (nonviolently but with telecommunications). It had been 8 years
since I had taken a drink. But I was still suffering from mental delusion.
The 12 steps expelled that delusion from me. I speak in prisons to men
trying to find an answer. They always appreciate it. That's the giving it
away part.

<p>
Write back if you want. I hope you found peace and solace in whatever way
you chose to get sober. The 12 steps is not the only way. But it has been
the right path for a lot of people.
<p>
Best Regards,<br>
Dave

Hello Dave,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
Well, you really drank the koolaid, didn't you?
All of these statements are blatantly untrue:

<ol>
<p><li>
<font color="black">
Alcoholics and drug addicts suffer years of mental delusion even years after
stopping drinking and/or taking drugs.<br>
</font><p>
That is only true if they were insane before they started drinking, or if they suffered from major brain
damage from drugs and alcohol. There is no mental illness that is cured by the A.A. religion.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
The AA 12 steps saved my soul.<br>
</font><p>
Practicing Frank Buchman's old cult religion does not save people's souls. Sorry.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
It is not a cult.<br>
</font><p>
A.A. is most assuredly a cult.  A.A. is obviously, screamingly, blatantly a cult.
Read the Cult Test, both the questions and the answers:
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test, and Alcoholics Anonymous as a Cult</a>

<p><li>
<font color="black">
The Big Book of AA was divinely inspired.<br>
</font><p>
Get real. That is more evidence that A.A. is a crazy cult, just like your claim that A.A. saved your soul.
The <i>Big Book</i> is
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank">the evil teachings of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>,
as regurgitated by
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">a mentally-ill man with delusions of grandeur and a narcissistic personality disorder</a>.
<p>
If any &quot;higher power&quot; inspired the <i>Big Book</i>, it was Satan, not God.
See the file
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a> for more about that.

</font><p>

Wrong. A.A. has a huge resemblance, like the charismatic cult leader Bill Wilson
selling Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion as a cure for alcohol abuse, and deceiving millions of people.
<p>
Just yesterday, there was
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321223946/http://www.lohud.com/article/20120217/NEWS02/302170034/Bedford-home-Alcoholics-Anonymous-pioneers-may-get-landmark-status-view-14-photos" target="_blank">a discussion</a>
of someone wanting to make &quot;Stepping Stones&quot;  &#8212;  Bill Wilson's house
in Bedford Hills  &#8212;  into a national historic site.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321223946/http://www.facebook.com/orange.papers" target="_blank">I had to comment</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
That would be a lot like making Lafayette Ronald Hubbard's house a national historic site.
For those who don't recognise the name, &quot;L. Ron Hubbard&quot; was the founder
of Scientology. He and Bill W. had a lot in common: Both were stoned crazy psychopaths
who foisted fairy tales and cult religion on sick people and claimed that they had
made the medical discovery of the century. Both did more harm than good. Neither
produced anything that actually works. Both were literally insane (their psychiatrists
said so). And both died very rich as a result of selling nonsense to sick people.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And I could have continued with, both men founded cults that pretended to have a cure for a medical problem,
and both caused people to waste a lot of time and money on quackery, and both men were heartless monsters who
gleefully decieved and exploited sick people.

<p><li>
<font color="black">

</font>
<p>
You are once again broadcasting the standard A.A. stereotype of &quot;the alcoholic&quot;:
According to Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholics are all &quot;selfish and sinful and dishonest
and in denial and manipulative and childish and on and on and on...&quot;
Nope. Alcoholics are not all carbon copies of William Griffith Wilson.
See this file for much more on that:
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy</a>
<p>
You do not know whether people would be dead if they didn't do the practices of a cult religion.
Now I agree that many people would be dead if they had not quit drinking (including me), but there
is zero evidence that participation in a cult religion saves people's lives. In fact, 
the evidence is that cult religion makes them die more, and commit suicide more too.
And binge drink more, and get rearrested more, and get more expensive hospitalization.
Look here:
<a href="orange-letters272.html#results" target="_blank">Results of doctors' clinical tests of A.A.</a>.

<p>
Lastly, people who leave A.A. have not &quot;turned their backs on God&quot;.
The arrogance of Alcoholics Anonymous, to equate A.A. and God, is just collosal.
So much for the much-bragged-about A.A. &quot;humility&quot;.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
If people do not recover it is not because of AA. It says clearly in the big
book MOST CHRONIC ALCOHOLICS ARE DOOMED. That is telling the truth. In large
part it is because people will not get honest with themselves.
</font><p>
Well the <i>Big Book</i> is wrong. Approximately 50% of all drug addicts and alcoholics quit their self-destructive habits,
and the vast majority of those successful people do it without joining A.A. or any other cult religion.
They just quit.  Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental</a>
<br>
The claim that chronic alcoholics are doomed unless they join A.A. is just cultish
fear tactics  &#8212;  more evidence that A.A. really is a cult.
<p>
Then the put-down that people will not get honest with themselves is just more cultish denigration of
people and instilling guilt, doubts, and powerlessness. And of course you are also pushing the cult teaching
that &quot;The Program is perfect, it's just the people who are imperfect.&quot; And, &quot;The Program doesn't fail
people; people fail the Program.&quot;

<p><li>
<font color="black">
The book recounts an experience of Dr. Carl Jung who told a patient he was
an alcoholic of the hopeless variety. But Dr. Jung also told him that once
in a while alcoholics of the hopeless variety have a &quot;religious&quot; experience
that leads them to recovery.
</font><p>
That entire story is probably apocryphal. There is no documentation or reliable
evidence to support the fable.
Dr. Carl Jung was not in the habit of scaring his patients with
death threats. That wasn't his style. It was Bill's doctor, Dr. William D. Silkworth,
who did that. We just discussed that before, just recently, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters286.html#Jung" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters286.html#Jung</a>

<p><li>
<font color="black">
Bill Wilson even solicited money from the Rockefeller Foundation. After
thinking about it, Rockefeller turned him down because he thought money
would corrupt the good that AA was doing.
</font><p>
Wrong. Again, that is just Bill Wilson rewriting history.
Rockefeller did put money into it. He supported both Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob
with stipends (&quot;outside contributions&quot;), and he contributed his employees for the original Alcoholic Foundation
Board of Trustees. The one thing that Rockefeller did not do was trust Bill Wilson
with a large sum of money. For good reason. When Charlie Towns trusted Bill Wilson
with a lot of money to publish the <i>Big Book</i>,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson stole the money</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
*** MOST IMPORTANT *** AA is not a place you GO but a thing you DO.
</font><p>
All that you are doing is demanding that people do the practices of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
It works, it really does. It gave me peace and solace.
</font><p>
The fact that you enjoy the cult religion routine does not mean that it works to
save the lives of alcoholics. In fact, A.A. is a total
failure that just raises the death rate. Even A.A. Trustee Dr. George E. Vaillant said so.
<p>
We have discussed this many, many times before, so I'll just point you to the discussions:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters272.html#results" target="_blank">Results of doctors' clinical tests of A.A.</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's and other early A.A. members'
own admissions that A.A. didn't work</a>.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters289.html#WHO" target="_blank">A recent letter where the World Health Organization
said that A.A. didn't work</a>.
</ol>

<p><li>
<font color="black">
Just like anything else, you get out of AA what you put in to it.
</font><p>
  
That is just an escape. Blame the alcoholic if he doesn't quit drinking by practicing an old cult religion.
Don't blame the cult religion. Never admit that the cult religion routine doesn't work to save alcoholics' lives.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
The 12 steps is not the only way. But it has been the right path for a lot of people.
</font><p>
Actually, the numbers of people who have recovered because of doing the A.A. practices is vanishingly small.
The claim that A.A. has saved or &quot;helped&quot; or sobered up thousands or millions of alcoholics is a lie and
a fraud, pure and simple. Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial</a>

</ol>

<p>
Now you did make a few true statements, but even they need some explanation:

<ol>
<p><li>
<font color="black">
People at Big Book step study meetings are not allowed to talk unless they
had completed at least the 5th step. The steps are done according to the way
they are laid out in the big book.
</font>
<p>
Only properly-indoctrinated cadre are allowed to speak, so that the brainwashing is not impeded.
<p>
The 12 Steps are still just Bill Wilson's rewrite of Dr. Frank Buchman's old Oxford Group cult practices.
Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-rroot030.html</a>

<p><li>
<font color="black">
It had been 8 years since I had taken a drink. But I was still suffering from mental delusion.
</font>
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your mental illness. You do realize, don't you, that A.A. is not qualified to
practice medicine and treat mental illnesses? That would be a felony, practicing medicine without a license.
A.A. members are not licensed doctors or psychiatrists.
So, did A.A. members treat your mental illness?
(Please give names and dates and places so that I can forward the information to your district attorney.)

<p><li>
<font color="black">
AA asks you to put a buck in the basket IF YOU CAN SPARE IT for coffee and
rent for the church for the meeting space.<br>
</font>
<p>
True, but that is hiding the other arms of the Alcoholics Anonymous octopus.
They only ask for a few bucks in the basket at the A.A. meetings,
but down the street is a 12-Step treatment center that is staffed by A.A. members, and they demand
$10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000, or even $40,000 for 28 days of indoctrination in Frank Buchman's religion.
And of course they teach that A.A. is the only way.
Then they give you a &quot;free&quot; <i>Big Book</i>, and send you to A.A. meetings.
(That is a pretty expensive &quot;free&quot; book.)

</ol>

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Re: AA's Problems<br>

<p>
I stated: &quot;Any rational, objective survey of AA is going to find a
little bad, a little good and a lot of mediocrity because that is the
reality of social institutions. That's why AA can continue; if it were
obviously evil and drove masses of people to suicide immediately, it
couldn't survive that long. Rather, it subtly influences people and
causes real harm here and there, willy-nilly, to relatively small
percentages of people.&quot;

<p>
You replied:

<p>

&quot;You are doing it again, right now. The argument &quot;a
little bad, a little good&quot; is another attempt at Escape via
Antirationalism, and Escape via Relativism.

<p>
And the line about suicide is a dishonest exaggeration. I never said
that A.A. caused &quot;masses&quot; of people to commit suicide. I said that
A.A. raises the suicide rate in alcoholics. How many suicides do you
think is okay?

<p>
Your argument that A.A. only harms &quot;relatively small percentages of
people&quot; is without foundation. What study or test or survey
established what percentage of people were harmed by A.A. dogma and
false teachings? Again, how many suicides, or how many girls raped,
constitutes only a &quot;&quot;relatively small percentage&quot; which isn't worth
worrying about?&quot;
<br>
</font>

<p>
In the above exchange, you misunderstood me. I wasn't exaggerating
your claims or defending AA. I was demonstrating that an objective
view of AA would include a great deal of mediocre results, some poor
results and some good results. Thus, an unscrupulous debater could
cherry pick good results from the survey as a whole to characterize
the overall survey as a defense of AA (as you have with me). This
would be similar to someone picking out the very few things that you
admit are good about AA and characterizing you as an AA defender.
You're not an AA defender &#8212;  you're openly hostile to AA &#8212;  but you are
objective enough to give &quot;the devil its due&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Andrew,
<p>
Every time I find a flaw in your logic, you claim that I &quot;misunderstood you&quot;.
<p>
I still stand by my statement that trying to use the argument of &quot;some bad, some good&quot; is an
attempt at
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a>.
And it's also <a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation" target="_blank">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>.

The fact that you can find some sober people at an A.A.
meeting does not prove that A.A. has done anything good.
<p>
Of course you will find some sober, recovered alcoholics in any
randomly-selected group of alcoholics. But that is not evidence that A.A. did anything good
for them. A.A. tries to claim that credit for all instances of spontaneous remission (while never claiming
any of the blame for the sick people).

</font>
<p>
I would characterize a small percentage as an order of magnitude
smaller than the primary statistic at hand. If the natural remission
rate of alcoholism is 50%, then a program that increased or decreased
that by less than five percent would have a &quot;small&quot; effect.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That doesn't make a lot of sense. An order of magnitude smaller than the &quot;primary statistic at hand&quot;?
What are you talking about?

</font>
<p>
And if your debating style distorts information and uses logical
fallacies, then that effects how I interpret your message and the
credibility of that message. Truth and lies exist on a continuum; if
you feel morally justified to twist the truth, exaggerate, drag in the
Nazi party every time you have an emphatic point to make, distort the
arguments of people who disagree with you and demonize a vast
heterogenous group of people, then why wouldn't you feel morally
justified to lie?

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't use logical fallacies. Nor do I distort or twist the truth.
<p>
And I'm not demonizing you. I just notice that your thinking is confused and relies on
a lot of logical fallacies, like imagining that A.A. is okay because people need
&quot;a compelling origin myth&quot; and &quot;the expense of providing comprehensive
health care for everyone is greater than the cost of AA meetings&quot; &#8212;
as if A.A. meetings provided health care, which they don't.
<p>
The references to the Nazis are quite justified when somebody, like the 12-Step
cult religion for example, is selling a philosophy that is derived from an old
pro-Nazi religious group that was founded by
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg" target="_blank">a guy who went to Nuremberg
Nazi Party rallies and <i>Sieg-Heil</i>ed Adolf Hitler</a>.

<p>
If I were just gratuitously mentioning the Nazis, that would be an obnoxious
propaganda trick.  But there is nothing gratuitous about the involvement of the
Nazis in Alcoholics Anonymous history and philosophy. Bill Wilson even wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
How persistently we claim the right to decide all by ourselves just what
we shall think and just how we shall act.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
We are certain that our intelligence, backed by willpower,
can rightly control our inner lives and guarantee us success in
the world we live in. This brave philosophy, wherein each man
plays God, sounds good in the speaking, but it still has to
meet this acid test: how well does it actually work?
One good look in the mirror ought to be answer enough for any
alcoholic.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
So, because you goofed before, and made some mistakes, you must now choose slavery,
and let your sponsor and the other old-timers do your thinking for you
and tell you what to think and what to do. You don't even the <i>the right</i> to decide what
you will think.
<p>
Then Bill Wilson wrote:
<p>
<a name="follow_dictates"> </a>
<blockquote>

<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 100.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just follow the orders of your superior. That is the Nazi philosophy.

</font>
<p>
I stated: I believe that contemporary science has very few meaningful
things to say on how to solve sickness of the soul and spirit. It
wouldn't surprise me if everything we believed about addiction was
contradicted in two or three generations. That is not an appeal to
irrationality ? that is a pragmatic view of contemporary science.

<p>
You replied:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Sickness of the soul and spirit&quot;? Don't you mean mental
illness, like depression or bipolar disorder, or Narcissitic
Personality Disorder? And brain damage from ethanol poisoning and
malnutrition? Or are you making another appeal to irrationality, and
trying to claim that spirits get sick? Are there spiritual bacteria
and viruses? Evil spirits that overwhelm and take possession of good
spirits? How do spirits get sick? When and where has &quot;spiritual
sickness&quot; ever been established, besides in the Oxford Group and in
Bill Wilson's demented mind?
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, you are looking for a straw man to beat. When science cannot
answer questions, we must use imprecise words. Was it illogical to use
the word &quot;element&quot; before the invention of chemistry? No. Alchemy was
a necessary predecessor of chemistry. We must use the words &quot;soul&quot; and
&quot;spirit&quot; until there is a more precise word based on empirical facts.
It would be foolish to deny that the soul and spirit exist; as foolish
as denying the existence of matter before the science of a chemistry.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is another irrational argument. You are trying to posit the existence of &quot;spiritual medicine&quot;
with no evidence except a straw man argument. Yes, your own counter-argument is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#straw_man" target="_blank">straw man argument</a>,
propping up primitive alchemy as a straw man to beat up.
And you suggest that because the medieval alchemists didn't know a lot about chemistry, that modern
doctors do not know much either. (That is exactly the same argument as an A.A. booster used
in an irrational promotion of A.A. back in the year 2000,
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html#straw_man" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
You are trying to imply that someday in the future, when we learn more, we will discover the world of
the spirits, and spiritual sickness. Baloney. We've already done that one for the last four or five thousand
years, at least. Shamen were shaking rattles in the faces of sick people, trying to expel evil spirits,
for at least five thousand years before Sir Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin.
Now the rattle-shaking routine is out of fashion, simply because it does not work, and antibiotics do work.

</font>
<p>
You have a reductionist view of the human body and mind. From the
interior, from introspection, we feel our souls and our spirits.
Indubitably, they are part of our minds and emotions; we give them
special vernacular names, though, because they are so important. It is
what makes great art inspiring. Its what gives religion and spiritual
exercise its pull on the human heart. Love itself is a product of the
spirit and soul. Our dreams and aspirations come from our souls and
spirits.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is not a single solid fact in that paragraph. You are giving me an
airy-fairy argument and trying to imply that it has something to do with medicine
&#8212;  specifically, that such fluffy grandiose language has something to do with
curing alcoholics of a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; that is causing them to drink too much alcohol.
<p>
And you have not explained how your &quot;spiritual disease&quot; differs from mental illnesses
like depression or bipolar disorder.
</font>
<p>
Really these are just shorthand for everyday phenomena that we know
through introspection into our emotional states rather than through
medical science. It doesn't mean they must be scourged from everyday
speech because they are illogical, Spock.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Shorthand? No, superstition. Your emotional states are not &quot;spirituality&quot;.
You are failing to distinguish between psychology and &quot;spirituality&quot;.
You are making Bill Wilson's big mistake of claiming that emotional events are
&quot;spiritual experiences&quot;.

</font>
<p>
Science does not have a model yet that shows how the physical
processes of the brain results in a thought. They can show stimulation
in certain areas. They can show neurons firing, but no one knows how
to translate those into thoughts. Does that mean that thoughts don't
exist? That's why Skinner proposed black box psychology; you could
avoid having to conceptualize internal states if you postulate the
brain as a black box with inputs and outputs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ignorance" target="_blank">appeal to ignorance</a>,
another propaganda trick.
Lack of knowledge in one area does not prove the existence of something else.
Even if doctors and neurologists had no idea how neurons firing results in thought (which isn't true),
that would still not prove or even hint at the existence of a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; that
makes people drink too much alcohol.
<p>
By the way, we do understand how neurons firing produces thought. Maybe you don't understand it, but a lot of other
people do. We have CAT scans and MRIs now, and have mapped out a great deal of the functioning of the
human brain. And we can easily see how thought stops when certain parts of the brain die.
</font>
<p>
Just because the current model of neuroscience can't explain exactly
how a thought occurs, doesn't mean that they don't exist. I am certain
that I have had thoughts. Just because we can't measure the soul, or
weight the spirit doesn't mean that those words don't mean something.
Perhaps you can paraphrase soul as &quot;the mental seat of human empathy,
faith in oneself and hope&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is more nonsense. You are trying to argue that because you are ignorant of neurology,
that &quot;spirit&quot; exists. Baloney. And doctors and neurologists <i>can</i> explain the functioning
of the brain. Your ignorance is not their ignorance. Your inability to explain something is not their
inability to explain it.
<p>
Your argument is just like somebody claiming that, because he is ignorant of meteorology
and physics and the workings of the climate, that lighting proves that the Thunder God Thor
really does exist. Nonsense.
<p>
I'd bet that you also cannot trace signals through the logic gates of a computer. I doubt that
you know how to logic your way through the circuitry, and say, &quot;Because this gate put out a negative signal,
this following gate put out a positive signal, and that led to the computer 'deciding'
to jump to the subroutine where it prints an 'A' on the terminal.&quot;
Such a lack of knowledge of the internal workings of a computer does not prove that the computer
has a soul or a spirit, either.
<p>
(In fact, I am the only man that I personally know who has actually done that. I repaired a few computers that
were built way back before the invention of the microcomputer chip, back in the days when the CPU was
just a huge bunch of early 7400 series TTL chips. I didn't find any soul in there, just a lot of
silicon logic gates and wires.)

<p>
Now I'm not saying that there is no such thing as spirit  &#8212;  that is a different argument. I'm saying that
your logical fallacies and bad arguments do not prove the existence of spirit.
<p>
What you are demonstrating is that <i>you want to believe</i>. Your belief is not based on evidence or
logic, it is based on a deep-seated need to believe.

</font>
<p>
<a name="sickness"> </a>
I have suffered a sickness of the spirit and soul. In empirical terms
I would describe it as: &quot;listlessness, lack of affect, despair, lack
of pleasure, lack of self-esteem, irrational guilt, anxiety, fear etc.
(even a clinical description uses vague words like despair and
anxiety)&quot; From the inside, sickness of the spirit seems like a more
accurate description.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What you are describing is mental illness, not a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
It sounds pretty much like a textbook case of depression and an anxiety disorder.
Have you seen a doctor, or specifically, a psychiatrist? If not, why not?
<p>
Please do not waste your life, getting quack medicine in a cult, when you could see a
real doctor and get real help and be happier.
<p>
I mean really. See a doctor. Do not trust the 12 Steps of Buchmanism to fix you. In fact,
the guilt induction routine of listing and confessing all of your sins and moral shortcomings and
wrongs will make your depression worse. Don't do it. See a doctor.

</font>
<p>
And, by the way, many respected psychologists, therapists and
philosophers use terms like &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;identity&quot;, &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot;
which are large general concepts that defy easy definition. If you use
precise terms while talking about something you don't know about, you
are still talking about something you don't know about. Similarly, a
person can use vague terms to precisely describe the relationship
between vague concepts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you just arguing that because some people use words like &quot;spirit&quot;
or &quot;soul&quot;, that such things are real. That is another logical fallacy.
It's called <a href="orange-propaganda.html#reification" target="_blank">Reification</a>.
<p>
We use lots of words and expressions for vague concepts. That does not make those
vague concepts and expressions into real things.
I remember Tracy Kidder's book <i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>, which was the
story of two teams of whiz kids creating a new computer at Data General Corporation.
That book does not prove that computers have souls.

</font>
<p>
I asked you: &quot;Similarly, when was the last time you visited a credible
science website that had a laundry list of &quot;propaganda techniques&quot;
listed prominently? Just linking a well-reasoned argument to the
propaganda technique it happens to be closest to is misleading and
petty. Nearly any thesis or argument can be tainted like this.&quot;

<p>
You replied:
<font color="blue">
&quot;Actually, there is a web site that is totally devoted to
logical fallacies and debating tricks. I learned a few things from it.
I shall have to search to find it again.&quot;
</font>
<p>
If the essence of debate on empirical evidence was accusing your
opponent of &quot;propaganda tricks&quot;, then every science website would have
a section like that to the neglect of the subject of study. You could
be a great scientist by just refuting your opponent with a list of
faulty arguments. You'd save a lot of time, too, you wouldn't have to
actually study atoms or electrons or whatever, you could just memorize
debate tactics.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is again nonsense. You are just objecting to my noticing that you used a lot of logical fallacies
and propaganda tricks to try to push the idea that A.A. is actually okay after all.
</font>
<p>
You are aware of what you know. Sometimes I don't think you are aware
of what you don't know. Medical science is nowhere near to a cure for
alcoholism and drug addiction. A dozen cures have passed in and out of
vogue in the last fifty years and I am sure that contemporary best
practices are not that far away from the Freudian talk therapy of 100
years ago i.e. sympathetic listening to another human's problems.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is another illogical argument.
The lack of a &quot;cure&quot; proves nothing about alcohol abuse or alcohol addiction.
<p>
There is no &quot;cure&quot; for &quot;alcoholism&quot;, because there is no such
thing as the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;.
That is just like complaining that modern medicine has no cure for eating too much fattening food.
Both drinking too much alcohol and eating too much fattening food are <b><i>behavior</i></b>
&#8212; very unhealthy behavior, really bad behavior that can even result in death  &#8212; 
but it is still just behavior.
Drinking too much alcohol is not a disease, and eating too much fattening food is not a disease.
<p>
And the cure for both is actually very simple: Change your behavior. Just stop doing it.

<p>
Now quitting and staying quit is much more difficult when the drinker in question is suffering from mental illness like
depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder or bipolar disorder, or Narcissistic Personality Disorder
like Bill Wilson had. Then it is much harder for someone to change his behavior, but having a competent
psychiatrist treat the mental illness can help a lot. 

</font>
<p>
I have only pointed out aspects of the human condition to you. They
are tragic and crazy-making. What are they?

<p>
<ul>
<li> -Coercion and exclusion are a part of most groups
<li> -Most groups, bad ones and good ones, engage in groupthink
<li> -The best treatments for alcoholism seem to be relatively ineffective
<li> -People are willing to be deceived in return for something to believe in
<li> -No one ever went broke underestimating the gullibility of the general public
<li> -The average person would rather conform than be rational
<li> -About 90% of anyone's day-to-day life is bullshit
</ul>

<p>
None of these are a justification or rationalization for the existence
of AA, the Christian Scientists, the Scientologists, the UFO nuts, the
Hare Khrishnas or Raelians. It's a list of the objective reasons why
they exist. It's descriptive, not prescriptive.

<p>
And, here's my big argument, the human condition is so fucked up that
we need to accept that other people accept lies and illusions and
build their lives around them. While science might encapsulate truth
and reason, an individual scientist might dedicate themselves to an
area of research that is completely discredited in a generation. Does
that mean they lived their life in vain? No. Because it is
presumptuous to assume that the values I live my life by apply
perfectly to someone else. It may actually be unhealthy to try and
persuade people to abandon the lies that sustain their lives (sick or
healthy). I forgive people in AA for lying to themselves and others,
just as I forgive religious people for the folly and anxiety they have
caused with their lies. At the end of the day, the healthiest attitude
toward the heaping piles of bullshit that litter our lives may be
&quot;Whatever.&quot; Allah is the only way! Whatever. Flouride is turning us
communist! Whatever. Rarely have we seen... Whatever.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, thank you. That is indeed the &quot;big argument&quot;. That is the Nazi
attitude towards the human race, you know. And it's the Communist attitude too.
Both of them believe that the average human is too stupid to manage his own life
and think for himself, and he should be ordered around by a superior, either a
Nazi F&uuml;hrer or a Communist Commissar.  That attitude is called &quot;elitism&quot;.
Both the Bolsheviks and the Nazis thought that a small elite cadre should make
all of the important decisions, and the common rabble should just obey them.
<p>
And of course the stupid masses should not be told the truth. There is no need for that.
Sometimes the truth is even inconvenient. The ordinary people should just get a comfortable
standardized fiction or fairy tale, like a &quot;compelling origin myth&quot;
(<i>Der Volkishe Beobachter</i> or <i>Pravda</i> or <i>The Grapevine</i>).
<p>
Such an attitude is the antithesis of belief in democracy. In a democracy, we
believe that the voters should be told the truth, and they should be educated
and well-informed so that they can vote intelligently and make wise choices.
<p>
Yes, in the USA there are some cynical politicians who say, &quot;Let the voters
have their crazy causes and their silly superstitions and their wacked-out beliefs.
That makes them easier to manipulate and control, and it is downright dangerous
to try to educate them. They don't want to know the truth. It makes them angry.
Like Jack Nicholson famously said, 'The truth? You can't handle the truth!' Let
them happily wallow in ignorance and delusion. Leave them their fairy tales.&quot;
<p>
I disagree. I think we should tell them the truth. Some of them will be unhappy
about it and will squirm and wiggle in discomfort as their favorite ox gets gored
and their favorite superstitions get challenged, but I still think we should tell
them the truth.

<p>
And we should not tailor our treatment of mental illnesses and addictions to
accomodate the superstitions of a cult from the nineteen-thirties.
There is still zero evidence that foisting fairy tales and cult religion on sick
people helps them, or makes them recover.
<a href="orange-letters272.html#results" target="_blank">The evidence is that such fraud makes them sicker</a>,
and even makes some of them die.

<p>
Have a good day.
