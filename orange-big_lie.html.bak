Adolf Hitler's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank"><i><b>Big Lie</b></i> technique</a> is
alive and well in America.
The Alcoholics Anonymous propaganda mill never stops cranking out lies and
deceptions, and planting them in every journal it can.

<p>
We are talking about BIG Lies here, not some small error, or a minor
misunderstanding of the details, or even a slight exaggeration.
We are talking about blatant lies,
things like saying that Alcoholics Anonymous
works great, and saves millions of lives, when it really has a
success rate that approaches zero, and the writer knows it.

... some critics characterize AA as coercive, moralistic, punitive,
religious and exclusive. Some depict it as a cult. Still more
unfortunately, some of these mistaken opinions infect otherwise
scientific endeavours and public policy, with the result that AA
and the treatment it inspires are being marginalized and minimalized.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
What an utter tragedy of lost lives and wasted money.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It may be useful to review just what AA is and what it has accomplished
in its 66 years.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
AA and AA-inspired programs are the treatment of choice among occupations
that require assured success (autoworkers, law enforcement officers,
transportation workers and doctors), as well as privately owned American
hospitals, which must deliver successful outcomes, within a context
of cost-efficiency and accountability.<br>
...<br>
<a name="Vaillant1"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Studies by independent authorities, notably Harvard psychiatric
professor George Vaillant and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism, show that AA works.<br>
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Given AA's broad and long-term success, its unmatched cost-efficiency,
its adaptability, affordability and accessibility, and given the
scarcity of precious health care resources, should it not be government
policy and practice to maximize use of the 12-Step option? To educate
addiction and other human services workers about AA and its offspring?
To build more programs and services around the 12-Step model?
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

What a pack of lies and deceit. A.A. does not work at all, it doesn't have a success
rate, and Professor Vaillant proved it.
<p>
Professor George E. Vaillant of Harvard University is a Class A member
of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc..
He is one of the leaders of A.A.,
and one of the biggest promoters of A.A..<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>Professor George E. Vaillant is not an &quot;independent authority&quot; at all.</b><br>
</font>
Do you think that Peter Armstrong knows that? He should, since he is pretending
to be an authority on alcoholism treatment programs in general and on
A.A. in particular.
<p>
While working at the Cambridge-Sommerville [Massachusetts] Program for
Alcohol Rehabilitation (CASPAR) back in the 1970s and 1980s,
Dr. Vaillant conducted an 8-year-long clinical test of A.A. treatment of alcoholics,
enthusiastically trying to prove that A.A. works and is a good, effective treatment
for alcoholism.
<p>
<font color="blue"><b>Much to his dismay, Dr. Vaillant instead clearly showed
that A.A. kills alcoholics.</b></font><br>
And Dr. Vaillant candidly reported those results in his book
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank"><i><b>The Natural History
of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths to Recovery</b></i></a>,
in 1984. (He had to accurately report the results;
his work was funded by the U.S. Government, and he had to turn in a report that truthfully stated
what results came from spending millions of taxpayer dollars.)
<p>
Do you imagine that Peter Armstrong bothered to read Dr. George E. Vaillant's book?
Well, if he did, he saw this:

<p>
<font color="black">
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
To me, alcoholism became a fascinating disease.
It seemed perfectly clear that ...
by turning to recovering alcoholics
[A.A. members] rather than to Ph.D.'s for lessons in breaking
self-detrimental and more or less involuntary habits, and by inexorably
moving patients from dependence upon the general hospital into the
treatment system of A.A., I was working for
the most exciting alcohol program in the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then came the rub.
Fueled by our enthusiasm, I and the director, William Clark, tried to
prove our efficacy. ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...
After initial discharge, only five
patients in the Clinic sample <i>never</i> relapsed to alcoholic drinking,
and there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease.<br>
...<br>
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
...<br>
Once again, our results were no better than the
natural history of the disorder.<br>

<font size="-1">
<b>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths

The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<b>The Natural History of Alcoholism <i>Revisited</i></b>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, on pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Vaillant's A.A.-based treatment program had no better
a success rate than several other treatment programs that he examined, or even
a group of alcoholics who got <i>no treatment at all</i>.
<li>
As Vaillant plainly stated, his A.A.-based treatment program
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>&quot;failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism.&quot;</b></font>
(<i>&quot;Natural history of alcoholism&quot;</i> means what usually happens
to untreated alcoholics.)
<li>
A.A. didn't work; it didn't save any alcoholics.
A.A. was no better than no treatment at all.
<li>
And it was even worse than that, because, after 8 years of A.A.
treatment, 29% of Vaillant's patients were dead.
That is nearly one out of every three patients, dead.
<li>
Vaillant's A.A.-based treatment program had <i><b>the highest death rate</b></i>
of any treatment program that he examined.
Even Professor Vaillant called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
But Peter Armstrong didn't tell us about that, did he?
<p>
And here is the extreme insanity of Prof. Vaillant and his love of Alcoholics Anonymous:
<ul>
<li>
Even though Vaillant proved that A.A. didn't work and didn't help the alcoholics
to avoid death, Vaillant still insisted on sending all alcoholics to
Alcoholics Anonymous anyway, so that they could get
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;an attitude change&quot;</font> by
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;confessing their sins to a high-status healer&quot;</font>.<br>
[<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#high_status_healer1" target="_blank">No, that
is not a joke or an exaggeration</a>.]
<li>
Vaillant said that he wanted to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_cure" target="_blank">play mind games on his patients</a>
by combining
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;the best placebo effects of acupuncture, Lourdes, or Christian Science
with the best attitude change inherent in the evangelical conversion
experience&quot;</font> to
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;win their hearts and minds&quot;</font>.<br>
[<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_cure" target="_blank">And no, that
is not a joke or an exaggeration, either</a>.]
<li>
And Vaillant even recommended using non-logical mind-control techniques like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;systematic indoctrination and repetition&quot;
</font>
on the patients, to
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;effect significant attitude change&quot;</font>,
rather than any kind of common-sense approach like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;explanation of risk and rational advice by physicians.&quot;
</font>
(See pages 286-291, or pages 352-357 of the new book, <i>Revisited</i>).

<li>
Vaillant was obviously, blatantly, pushing his favorite irrational cult religion, not
promoting a working cure or treatment for alcoholism.

<li>
Vaillant even said point-blank that he did not intend to heal or
cure the alcoholics at all:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The point is that if one cannot cure an illness, one wants
to make the patient less afraid and overwhelmed by it.&quot;<br>
</font>
So that they can die as &quot;less afraid and overwhelmed&quot;
members of Vaillant's religion, is what he really means.<br>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Vaillant1" target="_blank">
And Prof. Vaillant also wrote</a>:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;AA certainly functions as a cult and systematically indoctrinates
its members in ways common to cults the world over.&quot;<br>
&quot;...in the absence of proven scientific efficacy, critics are
legitimate in suggesting that mandated AA attendance may be criticized as a failure
of proper separation between church and state.&quot;<br>
</font>

<i>The Natural History Of Alcoholism Revisited</i>, George E. Vaillant,
page 266.
</font>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<p>
But Peter Armstrong didn't bother to tell us that part of the story, did he?
<p>
I can only conclude that either
<ol>
<li> Mr. Armstrong wishes to fool us into using the
government's power to expand his adopted cult religion, or
<li> He's only in it for the money.
</ol>

<p>
Mr. Armstrong also said that a study, or studies,
by the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism &quot;show that AA works.&quot;
If Armstrong is referring to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH" target="_blank">Project MATCH</a>,
the NIAAA didn't say that, either.
What they said was that all of the treatment programs that they tested
scored about the same success rate.
But without a control group &#8212; another group of similar alcoholics who get no
treatment &#8212; which Project MATCH lacked, we don't know what, if any,
the real success rate of any of the various treatment programs was.
For any treatment program to claim success, it must score better than the rate
of spontaneous remission.

<ul>
<li> How many of those alcoholics would have simply gotten sick and tired of being sick and
tired, and just quit drinking alcohol, without any &quot;treatment&quot; program
at all?<br>
<li> Many, for sure, but how many?<br>
<li> Without a control group, you can't say for sure, because you can't measure it.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, Project MATCH
lavished so much money and attention on the patients ($27 million worth) that the
treatment that the patients received was anything but typical A.A. treatment.
Project MATCH even paid the patients money to <i>&quot;Keep Coming Back!&quot;</i>
to more treatment sessions,
which is something that Alcoholics Anonymous doesn't do for alcoholics.

<p>
I am also forced to conclude that the following paragraph is a deception and
a lie:
<p>
<font color="black">
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA's friends in the treatment sector have also tested outcomes. For
example, studies by Renascent, a Toronto-based resource centre for
the prevention, education and treatment of addiction to alcohol and
other drugs, show that up to two-thirds of residential clients achieve
lasting sobriety two years post-treatment. The key to their success
is involvement in AA. A literature review by Rick Csiernik at the
University of Western Ontario clearly identifies 12-Step residential
treatment as an important, effective and cost-efficient approach to
the illness. &quot;AA works,&quot; says Ontario addiction specialist
Dr. Graeme Cunningham. &quot;The science is there.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>

The science isn't in there. The cult dogma is in there.
And the author is simply citing his own fudged <i>&quot;studies by Renascent&quot;</i>
(read: &quot;pieces of propaganda&quot;).
Peter Armstrong is the President and Chair of the Board of Renascent.
And then the &quot;literature review&quot; that he mentioned is a joke &#8212; it's
just another piece of propaganda. The authors of such &quot;literature reviews&quot; only
cite articles that they like &#8212; other articles that are also favorable to Alcoholics
Anonymous &#8212; in other words, more pieces of deceptive and dishonest propaganda.
Such &quot;literature reviews&quot; are completely worthless for determining whether
Alcoholics Anonymous really saves alcoholics or kills them.

<p>
All of the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#test1" target="_blank">good, randomized tests
with <i>control groups</i></a>
that have ever been done on A.A. &#8212; in other words, all of the properly-done
tests of A.A. &#8212; have shown that A.A. does not work at all.
In fact, A.A. was actually far worse than no help at all &#8212;
<ol>
<li> A.A. increased the rate of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">re-arrests for public drunkenness</a>;
<li> A.A. increased the rate of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking</a>, and
<li> A.A. increased the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">death rate from alcoholism</a>.
<li> A whole year of A.A. treatment
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">was no more effective than a single hour</a>
of a doctor telling the patient to quit drinking or he would die.
<li> And <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a>
that A.A. just messed up a lot of patients and made
them more expensive to treat in a hospital later on.
</ol>

<p>
For Armstrong to claim that
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;up to two-thirds ... achieve lasting sobriety
two years post-treatment&quot;</i></font> is absurd.
Nobody gets that kind of a success rate (66%) except by engaging in
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#rehab_center" target="_blank">some Enron-style accounting</a>
and cooking the books by cherry-picking the patients, or not counting the failures and drop-outs,
or both.
A 3.5 to 7 percent success rate in achieving <i>lasting sobriety</i>
is the norm &#8212; which is also
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">the normal rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholics</a>. That's how many alcoholics will
just quit drinking anyway without any treatment or any &quot;support group&quot; at all.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
And watch out for the word games: Armstrong only told you what percentage of
his &quot;residential clients&quot; stayed sober, not what percentage of
<i>the incoming patients</i> actually quit drinking and stayed sober.
Do patients stop being &quot;residential clients&quot; if they go out
on a binge? Are relapsers kicked out? Probably.
<p>
That is actually a very common treatment center stunt.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#rehab_center" target="_blank">They tell you that &quot;graduates&quot; have
a sixty or eighty percent success rate</a>
(for maybe a month or two after &quot;graduation&quot;),
but they don't tell you that only 10 percent of the patients who start the program
actually &quot;graduate&quot;. They don't tell you that the
so-called &quot;treatment program&quot; is really
just a system for filtering out those few alcoholics who are ready and willing to
quit drinking now &#8212; and then the treatment center and A.A. will take the
credit for their sobriety when they quit, but will refuse to take any of the
blame for the other 90% who don't &quot;graduate&quot;.
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
And why does he only give us <i>an upper limit</i> &#8212;
&quot;up to two-thirds&quot;?<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;... up to two-thirds of residential clients achieve lasting sobriety...&quot;</font><br>

What is the lower limit? How bad does it get? How few achieve sobriety when things aren't
working so well?
<p>
That's the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank"><i>Lying With Qualifiers</i></a>.
<font color="#9F0000">&quot;Up to two-thirds&quot;</font>
could really mean
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We usually get five percent, but we might get two-thirds some day, if we get lucky&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Why doesn't Armstrong report that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;at least ten percent of all of the alcoholics &#8212; including those who
were coerced into the treatment against their will and didn't really want to quit &#8212;
always got sober for at least two years&quot;</font>?<br>
Why not? Because they didn't, that's why.<br>
</font>
<p>
<font color="green">
(Now how can I say that so confidently without even seeing his lists of patients?<br>
Easy &#8212; because nobody gets a success rate like that unless they cheat by
either cherry-picking the patients going in, or
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#rehab_center" target="_blank">not counting the failures
coming out</a>, or both.)
</font>
<p>
Mr. Armstrong also contradicted himself. He began his editorial by saying
of alcoholics:
<p>
<font color="black">
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Finally they discover AA and are lit up with hopeful sobriety.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Members start to recover; they notice that everybody seems to be
recovering; they swell with pride at the supremacy of AA. But their
hopes are deflated once again when they discover that even with AA's
stunning success, and with all the research and other treatments
developed since its inception, most alcoholics die, either directly
or indirectly, from the illness.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>

Yes, that is it. Most of the A.A. members still die from their alcohol problems,
in spite of the allegedly-wonderful results that Armstrong claims
to have gotten from his A.A.-based treatment program.

<p>
So how can Armstrong use phrases like <i>&quot;the supremacy of AA&quot;</i>
and <i>&quot;AA's stunning success&quot;</i> when the majority of the A.A. members
die anyway? What stunning success?
<font color="blue">
(That's the propaganda trick of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">Assume the Major Premise</a>&quot;.)
</font>

<p>
I have to keep asking myself, just what kind of people does it take
to deliberately deceive us this way in critical matters of life or death?
<p>
What kind of a man would knowingly hand you a jar of gunk that had poisoned a bunch
of people and tell you that it is good medicine that cured many people, so why
don't you eat some of it? (Oh, and &quot;Pay me thousands of dollars for it&quot;, too.)
<p>
Some of the motivations of the A.A. promoters are easy to understand. Armstrong also
wrote in that same editorial:
<p>
<font color="black">
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Last year, for example, 600 volunteers contributed more than 25,000
hours to Renascent. Five hundred individuals, unions, foundations,
corporations and families added donations in cash and in kind
totalling $1.87 million.
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>
And Armstrong didn't even mention what the public health care and
health insurance systems pay into his little empire, or what he actually
charges his patients for &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>
It's a very profitable scam, isn't it? The Big Lie pays big.
It's just amazing how much money you can make by selling quack medicine and
cult religion.

Nov. 13, 2004 &#8212; CHEYENNE, Wyo. &#8212; A pill that fights obesity and helps patients quit smoking won't be the ultimate cure to these problems, some Cheyenne doctors say. 

<p>
The new &quot;super pill&quot; also could help curb drug and alcohol abuse, but local physician James Haller said he's still skeptical. He said Acomplia, also known as rimonabant, works by affecting the brain's transmitters, taking away the compulsion for things like food, cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. 

<p>
He said the drug by itself would only serve as a short-term crutch for addicts. 

<p>
&quot;It's one resource in addition to things like <strong><em>Alcoholics</em></strong> <strong><em>Anonymous</em></strong>,&quot; he said. 

<p>
He added even if Acomplia gets federal approval, he probably won't prescribe the drug. He said patients might use the pill as a way to procrastinate getting into a treatment program of some kind. 

<p>
Since he runs the alcohol and drug program at United Medical Center-West, Haller said he sees the effects of addiction on a regular basis. He said treatment and counseling programs are still the proven method for beating addiction. 

<p>
Haller said an alcoholic who regularly goes to <strong><em>Alcoholics</em></strong> <strong><em>Anonymous</em></strong> meetings is 95 percent likely to remain sober a year later. He added the number drops to 15 percent for people who try to quit a substance without any help. 

<p>
<a name="substituting"> </a>
&quot;(Acomplia) may be a nudge to get them to stay away from that first drink,&quot; he said. &quot;But by and large, it's not the solution. You're just substituting one more drug for another.&quot; 

<!-------------------------------------------------
<P>
Haller added he's seen many drugs touted as the newest miracle cure, and Acomplia also may be the latest drug fad. 

<P>
Jeff Peck, a psychiatrist at United Medical Center-West, said initial drug studies seem to show that people do lose weight, and higher dosages help people quit smoking. 

<P>
He said the people who are giving up their cigarettes probably had some motivation to quit before the drug trial started. 

<P>
Peck added it's too soon to tell how effective the drug would be, and there needs to be additional studies. 

<P>
&quot;As far as the future impact goes, any tool to help treat addictions would be helpful,&quot; he added. 

<P>
While Acomplia may curb cravings, he also said it won't replace things like diet, exercise and counseling. He added patients still will need to be motivated to quit. 

<P>
Susan Parkins of Cheyenne said there are lots of pills out there, and there will never be a single miracle drug. 

<P>
&quot;It sounds too good to be true,&quot; she said. &quot;One drug can do all that?&quot; 

<P>
She added people may be talking about the drug's benefits, but she'd like to hear about the drug's side effects.

Outrageous.
Never mind how well the new drug Acomplia works for weight loss or
reducing cravings for drugs and alcohol
&#8212; I don't have any opinion on that &#8212;
how could Dr. Haller be so misinformed and so far off base about the
effectiveness of the A.A. program?
Dr. Haller says that Alcoholics Anonymous has a 95% success rate, but that is the
exact opposite of the truth &#8212;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">A.A. has a 95% drop-out rate</a>.
Even the A.A. headquarters has documented that.
And Dr. Prof. George Vaillant, who is a member of the Board of Trustees

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">likewise documented a 95%
failure rate of Alcoholics Anonymous treatment of alcoholics</a>.

&quot;the alcohol and drug program at United Medical Center-West&quot;, so Haller must know what
the real A.A. failure rate is.
It's impossible for him to not see the failure rate of his program, and since he is such an
enthusiastic booster of Alcoholics Anonymous treatment, he is obviously using it on his patients.
So what's with this doctor? Is he a true-believer member of the A.A. cult
who
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">
just can't stand to see people using medications to treat alcoholism</a>?
It sounds like it, because he
parrots the standard A.A. anti-medications slogan &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You're just substituting one more drug for another&quot;</font>
&#8212; as if all drugs and medications were just the same.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>But can you get high on Acomplia? I don't think so.</i></font>
<p>
So drugs aren't all the same, and taking doctor-prescribed medications is not the same
thing as getting stoned on illegal mind-altering drugs.
<p>
Claiming that all drugs and medicines are just the same is an example of the propaganda tricks of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#one_similarity" target="_blank">The Fallacy of One Similarity</a>&quot;
and
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#equality" target="_blank">False Equality</a>&quot;.
It is also moronically simplistic thinking. I expect better from medical doctors.

<p>
Was Dr. Haller also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">lying with qualifiers</a>?:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;an alcoholic who regularly goes to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings...&quot;</i></font><br>

Does that mean that if an alcoholic relapses and stops attending A.A. meetings,
that he doesn't count?
So Dr. Haller only counts the few remaining success stories in computing
the success rate of his A.A.-based treatment program?
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Probably, because that's what the other treatment centers do.</i>
And that's the only way he's going to get a 95% success rate for Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>

<p>
And then Haller said that people who quit without A.A. only have a
15% success rate. Where did he get that number?

<p>
In the short run, going it alone has only a 5% per year success rate &#8212;
that is, the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics &#8212;
but the <i>Do-It-Yourself</i> method gets that success rate year after year after year,
so in the long run,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the no-treatment, no-support-group,
go-it-alone method gets over a 40% success rate</a>. (That is, 80% of the half of
the alcoholics who eventually achieve long-term sobriety do it alone, on their own.
One half of 80 is 40.)

<p>
So how could Dr. Haller be so ignorant of those facts?
Or was he just not telling the truth?
The article says that he runs a drug-and-alcohol treatment program.
Is he lying and only in it for the money?
Or is he a hidden member of Alcoholics Anonymous and a true believer who thinks that
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">lying to people and
deceiving them to get them to join A.A.</a> is doing them a favor?

another fudged &quot;study&quot;</a> that ostensibly
showed that &quot;A.A. works.&quot;

And also see
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Fiorentine" target="_blank">
Robert Fiorentine's &quot;study&quot; of Los Angeles-area treatment programs</a>
that concluded that 12-Step meetings cause people to abstain from drugs and alcohol.
