hey orange, me again..
<p>
<a name="depression12"> </a>
Just an update,  I got my naltrexone.  You wouldn't believe what I
had to go through to get it legally.  My doctor wanted to have me locked up when I
told her that my ptsd was acting up and I had been self medicating with alcohol.  As
if it couldn't be two seperate issues.  Well she wrote me a script on the condition
that I go to outpatient 12 step treatment for depression.  So I agreed. I also
purchased a book called <i>The Cure For Alcoholism</i> by Dr. Eskapa. Unbelievable,  that they
are hiding this information from suffring alcohol dependent people. Anyways, I will
keep you informed of my progress. Fyi, naltrexone is Fda approved to combat cravings
with abstinence. That is not how the sinclair method works. The formula is
naltrexone plus alcohol equals cure. I know that you are all for abstinance,  but
think of the implications. No need for expensive detox, no need for higher powers, no
need for meetings,  big books or self deprication. this would prove
your entire website. Which of course u have already done. Well, say another prayer
for me, please, I have alot on the line. 
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Lewis,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. I hope that Naltrexone works for you.
<p>
But <i><b>&quot;outpatient 12-Step treatment for depression&quot;</b></i>?
That is the worst quackery I have heard of lately. I didn't know there
even was such a hoax being sold.
The 12 Steps do not cure depression; they cause it.

<p>
I will have to check out that book
<i>The Cure For Alcoholism</i> by Dr. Eskapa. I had not heard of that one before.

<p>
Of course they are hiding information. They are not all stupid and deluded. Some of them
know full well that they have nothing but old cult religion to sell. If the full truth
were well-known, they would be out of a job. So they rationalize their behavior by declaring,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, if he would obey orders and work a strong program, it would work.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Sure, and if people will obey my orders and quit drinking when I tell them to, my program will
work too. &#8212; Any program, no matter whether it is the Ballerina Tutu Cure, or the Baskin
Robbins Cure, or the Patty-Cake Treatment Program, or the Tiddly-Winks Cure.
If people will do what I say, and quit drinking when I tell them to, then any goofy cure will work.

<p>
Actually, this line is a misimpression:
<font color="black">
&quot;I know that you are all for abstinance, but think of the implications..&quot;
</font>
<p>
What I am really all for is total abstinence <i><b>for me</b></i>.
<p>
Whether any given person should totally abstain from alcohol depends on that person &#8212;
specifically, on his medical condition, and his mental condition, and his biochemistry,
and how he reacts to alcohol.

<p>
My reaction to alcohol is instant love, like I want to marry it and make it my lifestyle.
And I want to drink myself into Heaven. Forget about petty things like relaxing and just
having one or two. I want to go way up above Cloud Nine. I want it to
be like LSD, and go for the Ultimate, and zone into The Next Dimension.
<p>
That is the dead give-away of someone who should not touch the stuff.
<p>
But other people are different. Again,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="newwin23">the Rand Corporation study</a>
found that half of the
recovered alcoholics did it by total abstinence, while the other half did it by just tapering
off into moderate, controlled, drinking.
<p>
My attitude is, &quot;Whatever works for you.&quot; I just want people to quit killing themselves.

<p>
So each individual person has the problem of figuring out for himself
whether he can moderate, or if he really should just totally abstain.
&quot;Whatever works for you.&quot;
<p>
Okay, good luck again, and take care of yourself, and have a good day.

<p>
hey orange,
<p>
heres my update.  I got the naltrexone as I said.  Life problems and insane
arguments with AA people trying to 12th step me drove me out of town for one last
bender that lasted 3 days. I ended up broke and out of beer and gas in the middle of
the adirondak mountains. I was able to get ahold of my dad to come get me the next
day. By the time he got there, I was in full withdrawl. He brought the naltrexone and I
took one, waited an hour, then got a six pack.  The results were immediate.  It normally
takes the whole six pack to stop shaking and convulsing.  This time it took one. There
was really no desire for another but i forced one down anyways. That was it.
<p>
  I'm
gonna cut this short.  I am now 4 days into this.  I have not stopped drinking but I
have also not felt a need or desire to drink at all.  I have had a beer or two each
day just to stop the shaking.  I came to work last night perfectly sober and not
shaking at all.
<p>
  Orange I am a round the clock drinker
who has obsessed about alcohol drunk and sober for over 25 years.  The obsession is
gone with no effort on my part other than taking a pill One hour before I drink.  I
have read the book and I also joined a cyber recovery group called
thesinclairmethod.com.  It appears it is a 3 to 9 month process before the addiction
is extinguished.  But I have hope that I have not had in so many years.  Why can't
there be a cure?? Because Aa says so??
<p>
 By the way there is a thread on My way out
dedicated to people using the sinclair method of recovery.  I also found an
interview with Stanton Peele.  It seems he wont get behind TSM because he does not
believe addiction is a disease so then there is no cure.  this seems ignorant or
self serving.  Whatever, its working for me.  I am also looking into getting help for
my ptsd and depression.  I am still interested in your take if you have one.  My goal
is to be alcohol free.  The beauty of this method is it eliminates the fear of
disasterous relapses as long as i take my pill before i drink, if i do decide to
drink.
<p>
Anyways,have a good day.<br>

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Lewis,
<p>
Thanks for the update.
I'm glad to hear that Naltrexone seems to be working for you. That's great.
Please keep us updated.
<p>
This line is very tricky:
<font color="black">
...he does not believe addiction is a disease so then there is no cure.</font>
<p>
I don't believe that &quot;alcoholism&quot; is a disease either, but there sure as hell is such 
a thing as addiction. I've also gone through withdrawal, and it isn't a choice or all in your
head.
The shakes, the seizures, the pain, the agony, the hallucinations and delusions and
insanity, that stuff is for real. I think it's a big mistake to equate the words
&quot;alcoholism&quot; and &quot;addiction&quot;. They aren't the same thing at all.
<p>
I can even agree with Dr. Jeffrey Schaler's book title
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Schaler" target="_blank">&quot;<i>Addiction is a Choice</i>&quot;</a>.
Yes, choosing to consume something until you get addicted to it is a choice,
but once you are addicted, you have a physiological condition of chemical dependency, and
if you don't get more of that chemical you go into withdrawal, and that isn't by choice.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day now.

It is indeed hyde park, London. There were other corners designated for public

<p>
I've been going to NA in england for 9 months. I read you bit last night about
de-programming your own mind and not being too down on yourself that you get snared.
I really was quite shocked at how much I swallowed without thinking or asking... but
I think I have to look on the positive side in that for first couple of months I was
not mentally capable of thinking straight, and after 6 months or so I was having
serious doubts and after 8 I quit.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, remember that they are very skilled at messing with your mind.
They know
<a href="orange-propaganda.html" target="_blank">a lot of clever techniques</a>
for fooling you into accepting ideas and believing stuff.
Alcoholics Anonymous is, after all, one of the most successful cults in the world, and
they have their recruiting and proselytizing act down pat.
They are not individually that smart; they learned those mind-bending techniques
from it being done to them earlier, when they were new to A.A.
Alcoholics Anonymous has had 70 years to polish its act.
And earlier, Bill Wilson and A.A. learned those techniques and mind games
from the Oxford Group and Dr. Frank Buchman.
Frank Buchman wasn't all that smart, either.
He learned those recruiting tricks and mind games and illogical theological
arguments from Henry B. Wright of Yale University,
who learned them from Dr. Robert E. Speer, who got
them from Henry Drummond, who probably got them from somebody else before him...
<p>
The cult religion game is a very old one. I mean very old. Thousands of years old.
You were up against a lot of old pros with an awful lot of years of accumulated experience
in messing with the minds of newcomers and fooling them into believing nonsense.
It was never a fair contest.
</font>
<p>
Lots of things rang alarm bells, probably all things you have heard before. One was
the spiritual principles and meditation stuff. I never heard anyone in NA mention
they had been meditating, not once. I never understood (still dont) what anyone
means by spiritual principles.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I know that they claim that doing the 12 Steps is &quot;practicing spiritual principles&quot;,
but it isn't. Making a list of all of your sins and shortcomings and wrongs and reading
it out loud to your sponsor is a cult practice, not a spiritual principle.
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#no_principles" target="_blank">
The rest of the 12 Steps are also practices, not principles</a>.
There isn't a spiritual principle in there anywhere. But Step Twelve reads, 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...we tried ... to practice these principles in all our affairs.&quot;
</font>
That is another line that they got from Frank Buchman. He is the one who claimed that his
goofy cult practices were &quot;principles&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Onward and upward,

<p>
Hi, Orange/Terry...
<p>
once again I'm having a great time reading things on your site.
<p>
And thanks, thanks plenty for what you're doing.

<p>
Now, got a question here.

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
UPDATE: Much later, in August of 2009, Roger Ebert revealed that both he and Ann
Landers were secret members of Alcoholics Anonymous. So Ann Landers was not
revealing her bias there.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
So I did some clicking and found &quot;My Name is Roger&quot;, and scrolling down I came across

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It prides itself on anonymity. There are &quot;open meetings&quot; to which you can bring
friends or relatives, but most meetings are closed: &quot;Who you see here, what you hear
here, let it stay here.&quot; By closed, I mean closed. I told Eppie Lederer, who wrote
as Ann Landers, that I was now in the program. She said, &quot;I haven't been to one of
those meetings in a long time. I want you to take me to one.&quot; Her limousine picked
me up at home, and we were driven to the Old Town meeting, a closed meeting. I went
in first, to ask permission to bring in Ann Landers. I was voted down. I went back
to the limo and broke the news to her. &quot;Well I've heard everything!&quot; Eppie said.
&quot;Ann Landers can't get into an A.A. meeting!&quot; I knew about an open meeting on
LaSalle Street, and I took her there.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
What I get from this is that Ann Landers had been to AA meetings in the past, and on
that occasion visited again, at an open meeting.  This account doesn't specifically
say that she'd been a member, only that she wanted to visit.

<p>
Somehow I think that if she'd really been an AA member and &quot;an alcoholic&quot;, she would
know that she could come to a closed meeting.  I'd think also that Roger Ebert would
know that he couldn't break her anonymity without her permission (although I gather
that she had already died by the time this account was written).

<p>
Do you have more information about this?  Is there more evidence out there to
support the assertion that Ann Landers was an AA member (other than her relentless
flogging of the program)?

<p>
(Oh, and this gem from Ebert,
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;One sweet lady said her higher power was a radiator
in the Mustard Seed, 'because when I see it, I know I'm sober.'&quot;
</font>
I thought it was
the Almighty and Highly Powerful Doorknob.  Some years ago I set up an altar with the
Sacred Doorknob on it and took a picture which I then posted on 12-step-free, of
which I was a moderator at the time.  I think it's a swell  picture.  I'm pretty
technologically challenged, and I don't know if I can attach and send a picture of
it to you or not.)

<p>
Anyhow, hooray for you and what you're doing.

<p>
Cheers,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Laura,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks.
<p>
I think you are quite right. Saying that Ann Landers was a &quot;member&quot; is too strong of
a statement. Roger Ebert was, but Ann Landers wasn't. At least not from the evidence
that we have. If she were really a member, she wouldn't have to ask permission to
attend a closed meeting. I came to that conclusion a long time ago,
<a href="orange-letters143.html#Ebert" target="_blank">here</a>, as soon as I read Ebert's article.
So that wording was unfortunate, and not quite accurate. I should change that.

<p>
I'm still curious about why she spent a lifetime promoting Alcoholics Anonymous.
She was sure a believer in it.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello again, Orange.

<p>
Still loving the website! Just wanted to share these links with you, since
I've recently stumbled across several AA murder stories on your site.

<p>
Lou Wilson was a casual acquaintance with whom I shared several mutual
friends. We'd occasionally cross paths at the coffee shop and chat. He even
spent a night or two at my apartment. If you have a strong stomach, you can
google his name to get the whole story of how he raped her dead body for
several days and spent all her money, or something along those lines &#8212; I've
tried to block all the specific details.

<p>
Josh was one of my dearest friends, until he started hanging out with Matt
Johnson. I had told my then-sponsor in April 2008 I had a gut feeling Matt
had the potential to murder someone, namely Josh. No concrete evidence, just
a gut feeling because Matt was that sketchy. I was told to add Matt to my
4th step, because, in said sponsor's eyes, all that was just anger and
resentment I was holding against Matt. I still have that 4th step. Josh was
murdered less than six weeks after that 4th step. I wrote in there in so
many words that I was afraid Matt would kill Josh. If only I had not been so
blinded by the AA bullshit of &quot;Sponsor knows best,&quot; Josh might still be
alive today, because I would have been more inclined to go with MY OWN
intuition, and not my sponsor's.

I'd share more, but this email has been quite the emotional drain, bringing
up these memories.

<p>
I am quite happy to add that since I have recovered from my addiction and
quit 12 stepping, I have not become close friends or even casually
acquainted with any rapists or murderers.

<p>

Hello Meg,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the sad story.  I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
A.A. promoters often brag that everybody is welcome in A.A., that the only requirement
for membership in A.A. is a desire to quit drinking alcohol. And all kinds of &quot;everybodies&quot; do
show up there, too, as you have noticed. A.A. meetings are definitely not a safe place to recover.
<p>
I've been creeped out at A.A. meetings, too, like when I realize that the big muscular fellow who
is sharing a story about flying into a rage and trying to kill his friend
is really a dangerously unstable, homocidally violent psycho.
<p>
I was just wondering what kind of a hospital we would have if we announced that we had a
hospital for everybody, no rules, no questions asked except, &quot;Do you wish to quit drinking?&quot;
And no security staff on duty, either &#8212; not ever. And whenever somebody does something bad, the other
patients and the doctors and nurses just rationalize, &quot;Well what
did you expect? We are not saints.&quot;
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
P.S.: And any criminal or psycho can become a doctor after simply hanging out in that hospital for a couple
of years, and he is free to treat the patients however he wishes. That would be quite some hospital.
</font>
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I was reading your
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">snake-oil article</a>
and was disgusted to find a
schizophrenics anonymous group in that long lost of AA groups.  Absolutely
revolting.   However, I checked it out and while it is still obnoxious, the
steps have been softened a little bit (just to be fair).  There are only 6
steps, and In particular, there is no mention of daily meditations and
seeking god (which you made mention to in your article).

<p>
Although this is a small detail, I think it is worth correcting for accuracy
purposes.

<p>
Thanks for listening,

Hi Kevin,

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange:

<p>
Hello. I've written before about secular support groups for families and you
were kind enough to reply.

<p>
I was hoping you might be able to steer me in the direction of an answer to an
ongoing debate. There's an ongoing argument at a forum on whether or not AA is
religious.

<p>
There are some very interesting and intelligent arguments being posted, but it's
basically down to, &quot;AA ISN'T religious, it's spiritual!&quot; vs &quot;AA IS religious,
it's spiritual!&quot;

<p>
Apparently mentioning God doesn't count for religious, it's &quot;spiritual.&quot;

<p>
It's frustrating. Can you point me in the right direction on your website to
maybe get some better evidence or debating points?

<p>
Thanks. I'm throwing your site $5 as well, which doesn't sound like much, but
hope it helps.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Katherine

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Katherine,
<p>
Thank you for the question and the donation. That does help.  There are a zillion little
odds and ends expenses in doing a web site like this, and they add up. I just got another
old book on what might be another cult religion just last night. Thanks.
<p>
Ah, yes, the old &quot;It's spiritual, not religious&quot; baloney.
I covered that in the file
<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank"><i>&quot;It's Spiritual, Not Religious&quot;</i></a>.
<p>
I can't think of much to add to that right now, but I really have to repeat Judge John Shabaz's
ruling, when he was faced with that question: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcoholics Anonymous materials and the testimony of the witness established
beyond a doubt that religious activities, as defined in constitutional law,
were a part of the treatment program.
The distinction between religion and spirituality is meaningless, and
serves merely to confuse the issue.<br>
</font>
&#8212; Wisconsin's Federal 7th Circuit Court Judge John Shabaz,
in the case of <i>Grandberg v. Ashland County</i>, 1984.
</blockquote>
<p>
Claiming that A.A. is spiritual, not religious, is like claiming that it is night, not dark out.
Such jabber is meaningless.
<p>
Have  a good day.

Just thumbing through some old letters because I enjoy them so much and ran across

alcohol.  It's from hostility towards AA.  I suppose under those conditions Ted

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, that detail slipped by me. &quot;Hostility to AA&quot; proves that
someone is an alcoholic? Hmmm. I don't recall seeing that one on any of the standard tests
or questionaires that test whether someone is an alcoholic.

<p>
I understand his goofy logic, but it is goofy logic.
He thinks I need drinking company. But he has his facts
all backwards. Even if I were drinking, which I'm not, I wouldn't need to waste my time talking
about A.A. in order to find drinking companions. Just a short journey to the nearest bars and pubs
will supply all of the drinking buddies anyone could wish for.
No need to manufacture more.

Do you know how much damage you are doing with this? You are a good example
of self will run riot and you obviously are not an alcoholic. Leave things
alone that you know nothing about. You do not recover from Alcoholism. You
are given a daily reprieve. You do this by being part of the fellowship of
AA. You don't run and hide and do it alone. You might stop drinking but I
can guarantee you will be miserable if you are an alcoholic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Gordon,
<p>
Wow, here we go again. It's the same old lines about how telling the truth about A.A. is
<a href="orange-letters98.html#disservice_list" target="newwin22">doing a great disservice
to alcoholics</a>.
But this time, you are claiming that I am not an alcoholic.
<a href="orange-letters195.html#hostility" target="_blank">The previous letter</a>
was saying that my hostility to A.A. proves that <i>I am</i> an alcoholic.

<p>
What is missing from your letter is any evidence that A.A. actually does anything good.
What about
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="newwin17">the damage that A.A. is doing</a>
by foisting
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">an ineffective quack cure</a>

<p>
By the way, I did quit drinking, and stay quit, without A.A., and I am quite happy, thank you.
In two more weeks, I will be celebrating 10 years of sobriety. And then,
three weeks after that, 10 years off of cigarettes too.
<p>
Your argument that people do not do it alone is a reversal of reality. The truth is that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the vast majority of
people who successfully quit drinking do it alone</a>,
without a &quot;support group&quot;, or a cult religion, or &quot;treatment center&quot; rip-off.

Have a good day.

Hello Glen,

Yes, an alcoholic. But watch out for the definitions of that funny word. A.A. routinely
uses several different definitions, and mixes them up, which confuses the issues.

I'm sure that many of us would be happy to hear some of your thoughts. I understand

a good idea for us likeminded folks to stick together... so here is my unnoficial

Hello Todd,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
And thank you for your activism.
<p>
I'll try to get in there and take a look. I am offline now, and I just walk down to
the local library with a laptop to get Internet access, so the amount of time that I
have available for cruising the net is pretty small. Just keeping up with answering
email takes most of my time.
And then there is downloading Linux updates every so often, and doing research...

<p>
<a name="Wellstone"> </a>
One thing that immediately comes to mind, that I've been wanting to work on, but haven't
gotten around to it, it activism relative to the
<a href="orange-letters96.html#Wellstone" target="_blank">&quot;Paul Wellstone Equal Access Act&quot;</a>.
Follow that link, and you will learn about one of the lowest political tricks that
the bribe-taking Senators have pulled in a while. Basically, it was a trick to
give hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars to Wall Street. But that trick was piggy-backed
on a pre-existing bill to give &quot;equal access for mental health&quot;. Well of course the 12-Step
treatment centers interpret that to mean that they get more money for foisting
cult religion on the suckers.

<p>
Also see these letters:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters87.html#Wellstone" target="_blank">Can we get this shit stopped already???? HOW!? HELP!</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters107.html#Wellstone" target="_blank">the most exploitative criminals of all are <i>The Treatment Providers</i></a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters166.html#Wellstone" target="_blank">it adds the requirement that the treatment must be shown to
be effective</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters186.html#Wellstone" target="_blank">We need to keep reminding our
politicians that 12-Step treatment is a hoax that does not work</a>
</ol>
<p>

A clause in the bill said that treatment centers had two years to show that treatment
works. I am not up to date on the details, but two years is nearly over,
and I know that they are going to try to
fake the tests to make it look like &quot;treatment works&quot;. They stand to loose billions of
dollars in health insurance money if the clinical tests show that TSF (Twelve-Step Facilitation)
is ineffective. They won't be able to demand that health insurance companies pay for
TSF treatment. So they will do everything they can to falsify the results, and not do
actual clinical tests.

<p>
We need to write to our Senators and Congressmen, asking for properly-controlled clinical
studies of 12-Step treatment, specifically 
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a> .
The treatment centers should not be allowed to present their faked
&quot;<a href="orange-letters190.html#quack" target="_blank">studies that find associations</a>&quot;

 as evidence that A.A. and TSF work to make alcoholics quit drinking, or
drug addicts to stop doping.
<p>
The elections are nearly here. I wish I had been working on this earlier, but was distracted
with other busy-work. Still, the politicians are in listening mood with election day so close.
So now is a good time for some letters to your Senators and Congressmen.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Jamie,
<p>
Thanks for the message. Yes,
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">old Lizard Brain</a>
is absolutely relentless, isn't he?
I really like Whoopi Goldberg's line about the cartoon character &quot;Pepe Le Peau&quot;:
<font color="green">
&quot;He is absolutely relentless. He is everything that you want your agent to be.
But he is really just a horny little skunk.&quot;
</font>
Pepe Le Peau is a great personification of the Lizard Brain at work.

<p>
But on the bright side,
that relentless little Lizard Brain has kept life going for hundreds of millions of years.
We might be extinct if he weren't so crazy about getting food and sex.
<p>
There is just this little problem with him learning about intoxication and drug rushes.
Then he won't quit harping on that.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that SMART is going well over in Great Britain. That's good.

<p>
Have a good day now.
<p>

Seriously dude, you crack me up. Your awesome! I lost patience with folks
sucked into cults long ago, it is really nice of you to care. I have been to
a few aa meetings, with my ex, and a friend. When I went with my ex years
ago, after listening to a meeting and various testimonies, I was poking him
in his side, low voiced, saying 'this is a cult'....for sure I wanted him to
not drink, he was a bitch on booze, but I wanted him not to be a cult zombie
a wee bit more. Pick yer druthers I reckon.

<p>
Then I went with a friend for her 5 year cake. After that ritual was over,
all these smiling people surrounded me, asking me how long I had been a
member. As soon as I, uh,  &#8212; admitted &#8212;  I wasn't, you wouldn't believe how fast
that circle scattered. Cheers to you for taking it on. I just can't seem to
care enough for cult zombies to care.

Hello D,

Thanks for the letter and the compliments.

Yes, that &quot;Love Bombing&quot; routine is really something else, isn't it?
And phony as a three-dollar bill.
<p>
In the beginning it's,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We love you because you are one of us. We love you unconditionally.
Let us love you until you can love yourself.&quot;
</font>
<p>
But then, if disagree with their dogma, and won't buy into the fantasy,
and reveal that you are not really one of them, they can't drop you fast enough.

<p>
Yep, typical cult behavior.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day. I'm glad to hear that your brain is free.

Subject:  	A query<br>

<p>
Hi A. Orange,

<p>
I'm in the process of writing a rather scathing memoir on my experience in a 12 Step
rehab for booze problems four years ago.

<p>
I am definitely not a 12 Step convert and viewed every step of my three month
journey in that rehab with the deepest, most hostile suspicion. The clean time was
beneficial to be sure, but not the rest.

<p>
Once I overcame my initial fear that &quot;they were right&quot; I went back to my therapist
and dealt with my issues the slow sane way, through non-judgmental talk therapy and
some behavior modification. Now I have one to three cigarettes daily and two to four
drinks. Not a model life maybe, but better than too much of one or the other. A kind
of moderation if you will. That's the way I want it..

<p>
I ran into your site when I was angrily looking for dirt on AA. I just wonder where
you got all your facts or how you went about your research. Do you have a book out?

<p>
Best Regards,<br>
Jane

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jane,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
I've been collecting facts on A.A. and recovery for more than ten years now.
I get information from everywhere I can. You can start with the bibliography,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
I have used the excellent Inter-Library Loan (ILL) system of the local
county library to get even rare books about
the history of A.A. and it's precursor &quot;The Oxford Group&quot;.
They are so good that at times they have gotten me the one and only available copy
of a rare book in all of the United States and Canada.

<p>
I also go to the local medical university library, and get medical and scientific articles
there. And I also use the ILL system to get such articles.
<p>
And then of course there is the Internet. I download everything that I can find that is
relevant.
<p>
I also have a fair collection of A.A. and other 12-Step books, pamphlets, magazines, tapes,
and such things. A couple of people donated their entire libraries when they
quit A.A. Thank you. I also buy old books about A.A. and the Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament
and cults
off of Amazon and eBay, and I also occasionally find such books in used book stores, too.
<p>
It all adds up, after 10 years.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Lack of Safety in AA<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
As usual I enjoy reading your posts.

<p>
I noticed mention of pedophiles in and around AA.  There was one in the Escondido
Newspaper, (2005?) attending AA but when he wasn't in meetings he was staying close
to school yards.

<p>
I was reminded of Rabbi Neulander, (New Jersey), whose hit man for his wife was,
Len Jenoff, who attended AA on an ongoing basis.

<p>
And the, &quot;2,000 men,&quot; Clancy claimed to sponsor in 1993, one of which was Mike Q.

<p>
I wonder how therapists in good conscience, (with expensive liability insurance),
can dare risk sending a client to AA.

<p>
My best,

<p>
Beth

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Beth,
<p>
Thanks for the tips. And you bring up a very good question: Malpractice insurance for counselors
who recommend cult religion and quack medicine as treatment for a deadly addiction
problem &#8212; that is, Alcoholics Anonymous and its 12-Step siblings.
It seems like the insurance companies should charge a lot for such malpractice insurance.
Or they will, as soon as a few people win big lawsuits for malpractice and incompetence.
<p>
When you think about it, that situation is a licensed counselor advising the patient go to unlicensed and
untrained amateur counselors for &quot;help&quot;.

<p>
So where are the mad-dog ambulance-chasing lawyers when you need one?

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	re AA<br>

<p>
A better question might be: Why did you go to so much trouble to prove
something that can't be explained? So you can drink whenever? You can
do that anyway, with or without AA. The questions you pose and
exhausting research could apply to any religion, tea club, or church
parish...

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That is a neat, dense little example of A.A. thinking.
<p>
The first giant red flag in your letter is
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;something that can't be explained&quot;</font>.

So, you are trying to imply that A.A. works in some magical way that cannot be logically or
medically explained? Bull. A.A. does not work at all, it just steals the credit from some
people who were going to quit drinking anyway, and that can be easily explained.
<p>
Claiming to have <i>&quot;Something that can't be explained&quot;</i>
is a commonplace cult characteristic, you know.
<ul>
<li>  Here is the cult test question:
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_magical" target="_blank">73. Magical, Mystical, Unexplainable Workings</a>
<p><li>
and here is the answer for A.A.:
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_magical" target="_blank">73. Magical, Mystical, Unexplainable Workings</a>
</ul>

<p>
I do not drink. In ten more days, I will have ten years of sobriety.
I do not need to cricitize A.A. in order to &quot;have an excuse to drink&quot;, as
the A.A. slogan says.

<p>
And your third statement is just a lame attempt at standard old
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a>
(<i>DeNile ain't just a river in Egypt</i>):<br>

<font color="black">
&quot;The questions you pose and exhausting research could apply to any religion, tea club, or church
parish...&quot;<br>
</font>
No, the cultish behavior of A.A. is not common to any church or religion or tea club. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>.

<p>
The reason why I criticize Alcoholics Anonymous is because it is fraud and quackery that hurts
more people than it helps.
<p>
Have a good day.
