In the May 1, 2000 issue of the magazine, <i>The World &amp; I</i>,
we find the article,
<b>&quot;The Spiritual Dimension of Healing&quot;</b>, by
Jeff Jay.
That article is another example of A.A.-booster pseudo-science.
The A.A. proponents routinely plant such articles wherever they can,
to make the public believe that Alcoholics Anonymous is a good program for
treating alcoholism. This one is unusually obnoxious.
<p>
<a name="straw_man"> </a>
The first three paragraphs of the article are:

<b>A Peek Into Twenty-First-Century Medicine</b>
</center>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The healing power of the spirit, exemplified by the success of the
Twelve Steps program in helping overcome a variety of addictions,
will be harnessed more fully to treat a wider range of medical
problems.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Lawyers boast that when their professional forebears were writing
the Constitution and organizing the Supreme Court, doctors were still
bleeding patients to remove ill humors and using leaches as medical
apparatus. Indeed, it is only in the last 150 years that physicians
in the West were separated out from barbers and chemists and recognized
as a true profession.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As medicine moved out of its primitive beginnings and joined the
revolution in science, it is easy to understand why the spiritual
dimension of healing was absent from serious discussion. Spirituality,
with its nebulous connotation, sounded too much like the folk traditions
of another era and did not have the clarity of the surgeon's knife
or the pharmacist's pill. Today, however, it is only because medicine
is on a firm scientific basis that the spiritual dimension of healing
can be fairly evaluated. Although modern medicine has been slow to
take up the challenge, this healing factor is now too obvious to ignore.<br></font>

<p>

Note the embedded lies. This is a great demonstration of the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">Big Lie</a> propaganda technique.
The author managed to pack a great number of falsehoods into a
very small space:
<ul>
<li> &quot;'The healing power of the spirit' is an established fact.&quot;
<li> &quot;<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank">Everybody
knows</a></i> that spiritual healing works.&quot;
<li> &quot;The spiritual dimension of healing is an established fact.&quot;
<li> &quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The success of
'the Twelve Steps program'</a> in helping to
overcome a variety of addictions is an established fact.&quot;
<li> &quot;Modern medicine is an infant, just barely out of the realm of
blood-letting and leaches.&quot;
<li> &quot;Modern medicine was slow to move out of its primitive beginnings
and join the revolution in science.&quot;
(Not, that it <b><i>was</i></b> the revolution.)
<li> &quot;'Spiritual healing' has never been properly studied.&quot;
<li> &quot;The spiritual dimension of healing was absent from
serious discussion.&quot;
<li> &quot;Modern medicine has been slow to take up the challenge
of studying faith healing and 'spiritual healing'.&quot;
<li> &quot;The spiritual dimension of healing is a healing factor that is
now too obvious to ignore.&quot;
<li> &quot;The field of medicine is still in its infancy in understanding
the spiritual dimension of healing.&quot;
<li> &#8212; And, by implication, &quot;Sometime in the future, like in the twenty-first
century, modern
medicine will finally get smart enough to discover 'spiritual' medicine
and learn how to use it.&quot;
</ul>
<p>

Most of those statements are blatant lies. The only one that is even half
true is the third one: that modern, hi-tech medicine is relatively young.
It is true that the Constitution was written roughly 225 years ago,
when medical practice was still very primitive. Modern medicine
has made such fantastic progress in just the last 100 years that even
a very good doctor from the year 1900 would hardly recognize it.
He would be totally lost in a modern hospital. He wouldn't know
penicillin from streptomycin, and he wouldn't know an EKG from a CAT scan.
<p>
The author compares
ancient law to ancient medicine, because he wants to make modern medicine
look bad.
The practices of law and medicine have been on the opposite
ends of the success scale for at least 4000 years &#8212; meaning, law
writers have been successful, and doctors have been relatively
unsuccessful, and powerless over disease, throughout most of recorded
history. Thus it is easy to denigrate the practice of medicine with
such a comparison.
<p>
The practice of law is one of those areas of human knowledge which has
no need for electronic measuring instruments, or any of the other tools
of modern science. The legal profession could grow and evolve
even in antiquity. The Old Testament Jews and Egyptians had systems
of laws, and so did the Chinese, Japanese, and Indians at the same
time.
So did the Greeks and Romans later, and so did the Roman Catholic Church
during the Middle Ages. And then the English came up with Common Law.
And any philosopher could dream up another system of laws, and another
form of government, like democracy and a democratic republic, without
being at all hampered by the rotten state of the electronic arts.
<p>
But the doctors could not make progress so easily.
Much, or even most, of modern medicine had to wait for the
invention of sophisticated electronic instruments and other technology
that would help doctors measure, see, and learn.
The discovery of bacteria had to wait for the invention of good microscopes.
The discovery of the structure of DNA had to
wait for the inventions of X-ray crystallography and the electron microscope.
The sequencing of the human genome had to wait for computers, computer
imaging, PCR, and automated electrophoresis.
<p>
So it is easy to pick on medicine by comparing where it and law were 225 years
ago. But that isn't a fair comparison, and it has little to do with the
state of the art today.
<p>
That is an example of the
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#straw_man" target="_blank">Straw Man</a></i> propaganda
technique &#8212; set up a weak opponent and then knock him down to
make yourself look strong and victorious. The author has a resentment
against modern medicine because the doctors will
not agree with his ideas of &quot;spiritual healing&quot;, so he
attacks the doctors who lived 225 years ago, trying to make modern
medicine look stupid.
<p>
<a name="revolution"> </a>
And medicine did not &quot;move out of its primitive beginnings and join
the revolution in science&quot; like it was some slow, stupid laggard.
Medicine was one of the biggest and most important parts of the
scientific revolution.
What could be more revolutionary and important to the average citizen,
and really transform his life more than not dying and not having to
watch his children die from horrible things like staphylococcus,
streptococcus, polio,
small pox, typhoid, tetanus, diptheria, cholera, whooping cough,
or The Black Plague? Mother Nature had some truly horrendous little
surprises for the average man back in the days when the Constitution was
written, but <b>we do not live in terror of those things today.</b>
The other visible aspects of the scientific revolution, like steam
engines and
electric light bulbs, were relatively unimportant, compared to watching all
of your children get sick and die &#8212; or watching them not die because
the doctors could now somehow save them.
<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<font color="#9F0000">
<b>Beep! Beep! Warning! Bullshit Alert!</b></font>
The author is trying to play mind games on your head by presenting false
logical arguments. He wants you to believe
that modern medicine is stupid, and is slow to learn, and that is why
modern medicine doesn't use &quot;spiritual healing.&quot;
But our doctors don't use Voodoo dolls, witchcraft, or Gypsy hexes
to treat their patients either, and it isn't because the doctors are
stupid or slow to learn about &quot;spiritual medicine&quot;.
<p>
In fact, the author's logic is completely backwards:
Historically, modern medicine finally made great progress precisely
because it
finally abandoned superstitious things like faith healing and
&quot;spiritual medicine&quot;
and overthrew the dictates and medical restrictions of the Roman Catholic
Church,<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
and rigorously applied the scientific method to all medical studies.
<p>
&quot;Spiritual medicine&quot; and faith healing have most assuredly been
studied and tested.
It isn't as if no one wanted faith healing or other magical cures
to work &#8212; hundreds of millions of people have wished that they would work,
because in the distant past, that was all they had.
It isn't as if no one thought such alleged &quot;spiritual cures&quot; worth examining.
They have been examined and tried, and tested, often, for many centuries &#8212;
for thousands of years, in fact &#8212; and <b>they were found to not work</b>.
That is why we use things like penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracycline
for treating our diseases today, rather than magical incantations,
rattle-shaking, charms, prayers, spells, exorcisms, or voodoo dolls.
<p>

But the author cries that spiritual healing has been so totally
ignored and misunderstood that nobody knows how good it is.
And if only the doctors would get their act together, we could apply
spiritual healing to all kinds of ailments. And the author implies with
his title, &quot;A Peek Into Twenty-First-Century Medicine&quot;,
that in the future, we will return to using superstition and voodoo
for medical treatment.
<p>

Obviously, the author has some very funny religious beliefs,
as well as some funny medical opinions.
And he wants to shove those beliefs on the rest of us.
(Is he trying to practice medicine without a license?)

<p>
The article continues:

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<b>The problem of alcoholism</b>
</center>
<p>
Ironically, the most powerful example of the spiritual dimension of
healing was first seen in conjunction with one of the most virulent
physical and mental diseases: alcoholism.<br>
...<br>

In 1935, Robert Smith and William Wilson began a process that would
revolutionize the treatment of this disease. Both men were hopeless
alcoholics who, by a miracle of fate, were brought together to
overcome their common problem. The experience of these two men and
the next 100 &quot;recovering alcoholics&quot; led to a program called the
Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). This formula has now helped
several million people break the bonds of addiction to alcohol and
other drugs. And it has been successfully extended to help those
trapped in other addictive habits, such as gambling and overeating.
<br></font>

</blockquote>
<p>
This is totally untrue. Again, the author is trying to shove his
superstitious beliefs and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#Dogma" target="_blank">cult dogma</a> on us as established facts.
He uses an illogical argument like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank">Everybody knows</a>
that the Earth is flat...&quot;:<br>
</font>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Everybody knows that the A.A. program works, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">keeps millions
sober</a>.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Nothing could be further from the truth. It doesn't work. It has
never worked.
A.A. doesn't have a success rate, it has a
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">horrendous failure rate</a>,
like 98 or 99 or 100 percent.
But the true believers just ignore that, and continue to chant,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Keep Coming Back! It Works!&quot;</i></font>
and
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly
followed our path...&quot;</i></font>
<p>
Repeating the lie a thousand times won't make it come true,
although they have had great success in fooling people into believing
that Alcoholics Anonymous has a working program.
<p>
Almost everything in that brief history of Alcoholics Anonymous is
a gross exaggeration or a lie.
Even the &quot;next 100&quot; phrase is dishonest.
There were about 40 A.A. members at the time that Bill Wilson bragged
about the
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#org100" target="_blank">First 100</a>&quot;,
and approximately half of those first 40 A.A. members
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Akron_success" target="_blank">relapsed and died drunk</a>.
<p>
<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
Alcoholism is not a &quot;virulent physical and mental disease&quot;.
&quot;Virulent&quot; means contagious and deadly.
Alcoholism is not a contagious disease. You can't catch it from your
friends, neighbors or co-workers. Mental illnesses are never virulent.
There is no disease known to medicine which is simultaneously physical,
mental, and
virulent.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font>
The author's credentials listed below state that he works in a hospital,
but he has somehow managed to avoid learning much medicine from the doctors
who surround him.
<p>
William Wilson and Doctor Robert Smith did not &quot;revolutionize
the treatment of alcoholism.&quot; They founded and popularized a
new sect of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>, one that specializes in getting
alcoholics to practice Buchmanism and meet
in rooms and talk about their alcoholic experiences and also believe
in a &quot;Higher Power&quot; who will control their alcohol consumption for them.
In the final analysis, that &quot;treatment&quot; is
a waste of time.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">It doesn't work</a>.
It's just another
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">irrational, dishonest, cult religion</a>. And it is quack medicine.

<p>
The article continues:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the heart of the AA program are practical and specific actions,
including prayer and meditation.

</blockquote>

<p>
Half of the first sentence in that paragraph is true, and half of the last sentence
is true, and all of the rest is lies.
The A.A. program <b>is</b> based on prayer and meditation. That is true.
But
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#confession_list" target="_blank">the A.A. program
is not practical</a>. It is &quot;spiritual&quot;, magical, illogical, and delusional.
The rest, about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">how wonderfully it works</a>,
and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">the freedom of religion</a>
that A.A. offers, is all untrue, and ranges from wishful thinking to
deliberate lies.
<p>
Note the arrogance of the last sentence:<br>

<i>&quot;The Twelve Steps themselves are not the product of university
training or laboratory research, but their efficacy is
unmistakable.&quot;</i><br>

That is
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#Dogma" target="_blank">standard A.A. cult dogma</a>:
that the war stories of some old alcoholics are
<a href="orange-not_good.html#diplomate" target="_blank">much better than a college
education</a> &#8212; that people
who have no training in medicine, psychology, or drug and alcohol
rehabilitation counselling except going to A.A. meetings and doing
the Twelve Steps,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#baffle" target="_blank">can fix problems that baffle</a>
even the most learned and
distinguished of
<a href="orange-not_good.html#doctors_cant" target="_blank">real doctors, priests,
ministers, and psychiatrists</a>.
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.)</font>

<p>
That is, of course, very egotistical, conceited,
<a href="orange-not_good.html#arrogant" target="_blank">smug, and self-congratulatory</a>.
And it's also completely untrue.
<p>
The only part of it that is true is the fact that the Twelve Steps were
not designed by a university or laboratory, or any kind of scientific
research. They were actually designed
by an evil perverted Lutheran minister
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler" target="_blank">who praised Adolf Hitler</a>
&#8212; a minister by the name of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel
Buchman</a>. The co-founders of
Alcoholics Anonymous, William G. Wilson, Dr. Robert Smith, and Clarence Snyder, were members
of Buchman's fascist religious cult, &quot;The Oxford Group&quot;, and Bill Wilson
simply
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">restated Buchman's religious
practices and teachings</a> to produce
the Twelve Steps. The Twelve Steps are actually a formula for building
up a cult religion like Buchmanism, not a formula for quitting drinking.
<p>
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps don't even tell
you to quit drinking</a>, or to help anybody else quit drinking.
But they do tell you to
<ul>
<li> pray,
<li> and
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#colorTV" target="_blank">they tell you what to pray for</a>,
<li> and
they tell you to list and confess all of your sins, repeatedly,
<li> and
they tell you to declare that you are powerless over temptation,
<li> and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender" target="_blank">they tell you to surrender
your will and your life</a> to the cult or your sponsor or some other
&quot;higher power&quot;,
<li> and they tell you to
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">imagine that
your own random thoughts &#8212; the voices in your head &#8212;
are the voice of God</a>, telling you
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#inspire_guidance" target="_blank">what the
Will of God is</a> and what you should do,
<li> and then
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">the Steps tell you to go recruit more members
for the cult</a>...
</ul>
<p>
The Twelve Steps are most assuredly not a <i>&quot;simple formula by
which anyone may come to a
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">'spiritual awakening'</a>
that is powerful enough to put their addiction in remission.&quot;</i>
That is just another standard A.A. fairy tale, and the wishful thinking
of Bill Wilson.
People don't get
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience" target="_blank">the big
psychedelic religious experience and see God</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">people don't quit drinking</a>,
from doing the Twelve Steps. Bill Wilson had a
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#experience" target="_blank">dramatic religious
experience</a> that he said caused him to quit drinking,
but that experience came from alcohol withdrawal
and hallucinogenic drugs like
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">belladonna and
henbane and morphine</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#not12" target="_blank"></a>
not from doing the Twelve Steps
(which Bill Wilson did not even write until four years later).

<p>
The article continues:

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<b>Power of the mind</b>
</center>
<p>
The placebo effect has been widely documented in the last 30 years.
Briefly, it states that 35 &#8212; 75 percent of patients will be cured or
will experience marked improvement of their condition when given
a sugar pill or other placebo. Apparently, a patient's belief that
he is receiving medical treatment plays an important role in curing
his ailment.
<p>
The placebo effect points unmistakably to the healing power of the mind.
Still, the mechanics of this effect are almost entirely a mystery.<br></font>

</blockquote>
<p>
The author is actually getting dangerously close to the truth here,
but he happily avoids making the crucial connections in his thinking.
He considers the placebo effect and psychosomatic healing as proving
the power of the mind to heal, but he avoids ever thinking that any
apparent success of A.A. or the Twelve Steps that he thinks he sees
may really be just the placebo effect at work.
The author just won't allow that frightening thought to enter his mind at all.
He can't. If he were to realize that the placebo effect could explain
all observed &quot;benefits&quot; of 12-step &quot;therapy&quot;,
then his whole belief system would collapse like a house of cards.
He would realize that the sacred Twelve Steps of Bill Wilson are
unnecessary for recovery, and irrelevant.
<p>
The article concludes:
<p>
<a name="medical_recovery"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The field of medicine is still in its infancy in understanding the
spiritual dimension of healing. But it is clear that the power of the
mind and the spirit to overcome both chronic and acute medical problems
is real [see &quot;Is Religion Good for Your Health?&quot;
<i>The World &amp; I</i>, February
1996, p. 290; &quot;Spirituality and Medicine,&quot;
<i>The World &amp; I</i>, June 1998, p. 180].
In the twenty-first century, this healing force can be harnessed more
fully and effectively through scientific persistence and spiritual
growth within the discipline of medicine.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once again, the author knocks modern medicine, saying that it is still
in its infancy because it won't embrace his favorite flavor of voodoo
medicine.
<p>
Then he cites two other articles that were published earlier in the
same magazine as this article was in, <i>The World &amp; I</i>,
to support his claim that &quot;the power of the mind and the spirit
to overcome both chronic and acute medical problems is real.&quot;
That amounts to misquoting those articles.
The author is trying to shove this broken logic on us:
<p>
<ul>
<li> 1. Terminal cancer patients have been seen to get a lot
of comfort from religious faith.
<li> 2. Positive, upbeat attitudes have been seen in many
people who are recovering from serious illnesses.
(And the people who aren't recovering tend to be depressed.
Why is that no surprise?)
<li> 3. Therefore, all alcoholics should go to the 12-step meetings
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</ul>
<p>

The author also misuses the word &quot;spiritual&quot;.
Come to think of it, he never defined it; he just used it and let us
guess what he meant.
And it turns out that his meaning is bogus. Bill Wilson
constantly confused psychological, emotional, and spiritual things,
and so does this faithful follower of Wilsonism.
<p>
The authors of those two cited articles talk about things like how people
having a positive mental attitude towards their recovery from illness
has been seen to coincide with those people rapidly healing whatever
ails them, and then the authors call that &quot;spiritual healing.&quot;
It isn't; that's just psychology. That's just having a good mind-set.
And, the authors have not established whether the positive attitude causes
the rapid healing, or the rapid healing causes the positive attitude,
or they mutually reinforce each other &#8212; that each one causes
the other one to
improve, in a good &quot;vicious cycle&quot; (i.e., a feedback loop).
That last one &#8212; that they mutually reinforce each other &#8212; is highly
likely, because there have been
other studies that have shown that good mental health and positive, cheerful
attitudes enhance the workings of the immune system. And of course people
are more cheerful if they are recovering than if they are sick
to death, and dying.
<p>

<p>
<a name="World_and_I"> </a>
In addition, those two cited articles were less than rigorously scientific,
and were very pro-religion, going on and on about how religion
is the neglected
factor in healing, and doctors are prejudiced against religion...
<p>
So just who or what is <i>The World &amp; I</i> magazine, where all
of those articles appeared? Well, it is a
beautifully-printed, very colorful, glossy magazine that is owned by
The Washington Times Corporation.
(Watch out: The Washington <b>Times</b>, not The Washington <b>Post</b>.)
<i>The Washington Times</i> belongs to the Moonies. It is part of
Rev. Sun Myung Moon's <i>Unification Church</i> empire.
No wonder that magazine is slickly pro-religious, and unscientific.
It's the well-camouflaged mouthpiece of another cult religion.

<p>
(Note that those are the <i>only</i>
citations. The author does not reference any other documents or
publications in the whole article, to support his sweeping claims that
Twelve-Step therapy and spiritual healing actually work, or that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">A.A. keeps millions sober</a>.)
<p>

<p>
In the last sentence, the author makes a really grandiose statement,
that<br>

<i>&quot;In the twenty-first century, this healing force can
be harnessed more
fully and effectively through scientific persistence and spiritual
growth within the discipline of medicine.&quot;</i>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The author has not defined what on Earth <i>&quot;spiritual
growth within the discipline of medicine&quot;</i> is supposed to be.
That sentence is just so reminiscent of Bill Wilson &#8212;
Bill wrote plenty of equally
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#results" target="_blank">vague</a>,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#bombast" target="_blank">bombastic</a>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis" target="_blank">grandiose</a>, and
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#confession_list" target="_blank">delusional</a>
things in the <i>Big Book</i>
&#8212; things that sound impressive at first,
but which are really impossible to clearly define or explain,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#cult_speak" target="_blank">things that
don't really mean much at all</a> when you look closely.
<p>
<li>
Likewise, just what is <i>&quot;scientific persistence&quot;</i> supposed to mean,
and how will we use it to more fully <i>&quot;harness&quot;</i> an
invisible <i>&quot;force&quot;</i>?
<p>

<li>
And the author states that <i>&quot;this healing force can be harnessed more
fully and effectively...&quot;</i> without having established that
we have ever harnessed that <i>&quot;force&quot;</i> in the first place,
and without having ever shown that there actually is any such magical
<i>&quot;force&quot;</i> as <i>&quot;spiritual healing&quot;</i>.

<p>
<li>
So, somehow, the author says,
we are going to <i>&quot;harness&quot;</i> the <i>&quot;force&quot;</i> of
<i>&quot;spiritual healing&quot;</i> just like we
&quot;harnessed the Power of the Atom&quot;,
except that this time around, we will do it
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;through
scientific persistence and spiritual growth within the
discipline of medicine...&quot;</i>
</font>
</ul>

<p>
Yeh, right. Why does it sound like somebody needs to remember
to take his medications?

<p>
Then the author lists his credentials, which clearly show that he is one of
the influential people who has dedicated his life to shoving the
Twelve-Step cult religion on America:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Jeff Jay is president of the Terry McGovern Foundation in Washington, D.C.
He is also director of program development and chief information officer
at Brighton Hospital in Brighton, Michigan, where the Twelve Steps program
is being successfully applied in treating chemical dependency and other
illnesses.<br></font>

</blockquote>
<p>

Note that Mr. Jay is not actually a doctor.
He is a &quot;director of program development&quot;
and a &quot;chief information officer.&quot;
<p>
Let me guess:<br>

<i>&quot;director of program development&quot;</i> actually means
that he says that the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve-Step program will be the
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">one-size-fits-all cure</a> that
the hospital uses on all alcoholics and other cases of
chemical dependency, and also on
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">other illnesses</a>&quot;, too.<br>

And <i>&quot;chief information officer&quot;</i> means that he
does Public Relations work, and writes propaganda articles like the one
that we are examining here.
<p>
Did I get that right?

<a name="interventions"> </a>

We run into Jeff Jay again in a book that was published by
the Hazelden Foundation, on how to do &quot;interventions&quot;,
<i>Love First</i>.
Interventions are basically the tactic of confronting someone with
a gang of family, friends, and strangers, including the strong-arm goons
of an &quot;escort service&quot;,
who all demand that he go to a residential
treatment facility where he will pay a fortune to have
cult religion preached at him for a month. Hazelden, for
example, charges $15,000
for a 28-day stay. No wonder they published Jay's book.
<p>
I found that book to be a disgusting collection of mind games
designed to overwhelm someone and pressure them into agreeing to
go with the &quot;interventionists&quot; or &quot;escort service&quot;.
<p>

What was particularly revealing was what Jay had to say about
those alcoholics or addicts who wouldn't play along.
Throughout the book, Jay repeatedly chanted the standard A.A.
dogma about how
alcoholics are powerless over alcohol, and it's a disease,
and the alcoholic has no control over it:<br>

&quot;We now know that this is a disease and willpower doesn't work.&quot;
(Page 230.)<br>

Step One: &quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212; that our
lives had become unmanageable.&quot; (Page 247.)
<p>

And then, about the
alcoholic who refused to &quot;voluntarily choose&quot; treatment
in an expensive residential treatment center like Hazelden,
Jeff Jay wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If the alcoholic refuses treatment, read your bottom lines [ultimatums].
Remember, your bottom line is a way of saying, &quot;I will not
support this disease.&quot; It is a way to take care of yourself
when addiction continues to attack your family. You are not
punishing the alcoholic or addict. The alcoholic brings the
consequences upon himself by choosing addiction over recovery.
He can avoid consequences in one of two ways: (1) choosing recovery
or (2) convincing people to enable his addiction again.
If people stop supporting the addiction, the alcoholic who refuses
treatment is likely to choose recovery in the weeks or months
following the intervention.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Love First</i>, Jeff Jay and Debra Jay, page 134.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Choice, choose, choose, choose. So much for how it's a disease and the
alcoholics have no control over it, and only God can stop
the disease.
<p>
So much for the A.A. dogma that alcoholics are
&quot;<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">powerless</a>&quot; over
alcohol.
<p>
Someone who can make a choice has power and control.

<b>Footnotes:</b>
<p>

<a name="ftnt01"> </a>
<a href="#ftnt01_ret"><b>1</b></a>)
The Roman Catholic Church had bans
and restrictions on medicine and science all through the middle ages.
The execution of
Bruno and the near-execution of Galileo for telling the truth about astronomy were just
the tip of the iceberg.
Internal medicine was outlawed, and punishable by death. Thus no doctor
could
treat internal diseases, or even study them. They couldn't even cut open
cadavers to see what was in there. So people almost always died of things
like appendicitis.
<p>
The ancient Egyptians had a good practice of dentistry going. They could
extract absessed teeth, and do gold fillings, crowns and bridges. The
Catholic Church
changed all of that. Europeans got to suffer and die from absessed teeth
and
impacted wisdom teeth because the Church considered
dentistry to be internal medicine, and a violation of the Will of God.
The &quot;spiritual practices&quot; and beliefs of the Church managed to
delay modern medicine by a thousand years.

<p><br>

<a name="ftnt02"> </a>
<a href="#ftnt02_ret"><b>2</b></a>) I think it is fair to say that
&quot;There is no disease known to medicine which is simultaneously physical,
mental, and virulent.&quot; A couple of near misses come to mind:
Rabies attacks the brain, and someone who is in the final stages of the
disease may act crazy, but I don't think it would be proper to say that he
is suffering from a mental illness. He is suffering from horrendous brain
damage caused by the virus. The same logic applies to syphilis.
<p>
Both of those diseases are communicable &#8212; they can be spread through a bite
or sex, but they are not &quot;contagious&quot; in the sense of diseases
like smallpox or bubonic plague, so we should not call them &quot;virulent&quot;.
And they are definitely not mental illnesses like schizophrenia
or delusions of grandeur.
They are just horrible, nasty, communicable physical illnesses that
happen to attack the brain.
