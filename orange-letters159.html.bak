Subject:  	Your Orange Papers &#8212; Comment &amp; Question<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I've read some of your &quot;Orange Papers&quot; and always come away wondering what your
motivation is.  I also don't see any real contribution.  What runs throughout
what you write is &quot;listen to me&quot; ... &quot;listen to me&quot;.... but you don't offer
anything except criticism of other people.

<p>
So my question is...... &quot;What do you have to offer other than criticism?&quot;

<p>
Thank you,
M. T.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Michael,
<p>
I have explained my motivation many times.
Look <a href="orange-letters136.html#who_r_u" target="newwin88">here</a>
and 
<a href="orange-letters102.html#motive" target="newwin61">here</a>.
<p>
We often talk about what works for quitting addictions, and what can help, and
what has helped others. See
<a href="orange-letters133.html#what_works" target="newwin37">this list of what works</a>.
<p>
Note that somebody can and should criticize quack medicine, wherever
he finds it, even if he does not have a working cure of his own to offer
as an alternative to the quackery.
Nevertheless, I do have some working solutions and help and aids,
starting with what worked for me, the <b>&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;</b> method.

<p>
Have a good day.

Dear Orange,

<p>
I am so thrilled for your site and I really hope you write a book.  Have you written
one yet?
<p>
I have been around this cult AA for awhile. I continually relapse for 3
years, in and out of this program that told me if I didn't do it their way I was to
die.  I finally have gotten sober for good and walk away for good.  I have been
abused -shamed- told me to be dependent on meetings forever.
<p>
  I read all about bill
and bob and their occult guidance. I am so sicken with CR in churches now when they
know damn well the 12 steps were not from God as they claim.
<p>
  I mean I seen people
kill themselves because of AA. I seen predators and horrible people who have forced
sexual advances on new people.  I have witnessed AA first hand and the disgust I feel
is something I must write about.  It is truly a dangerous place. They PREY on
vulnerable people.
<p>
  I recently had an argument with a rapist. I found his offender
listing online, and he was so-called helping a new girl who is in a wheelchair with
walking.  So I told this girl. She told him. He confronted me in a dark parking lot and
basically threatened me. It was the last straw for me.
<p>
  I refuse to be associated with
sick ass people like AA.  I am a strong willed determined woman and I am an analytical
thinker which they hate.  I mean I have so-called friends in this AA, and when I
informed them I was departing and never to come back, they shunned me..  Just like in
the ancient times.
<p>
Good riddance. I am empowered and I am into true healing which I have found
through the holy bible, not some want be cult group. I got clean and saw the &quot;truth&quot;
and thought, &quot;Oh my God, no way, this is crazy.&quot;
  They truly believe in not thinking on their
own, and I cannot fathom why anyone would choose AA.

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
When i have the time I will write you a full essay of my experience.

<p>
I was looking on your site in the wish list section and saw this

<blockquote>
<font color="blue" font="Courier,Helvetica">
 Somebody did a
study that found that upscale, richer, alcoholics were
more successful in quitting drinking. They were more motivated to succeed
at getting their lives back together because they had more to lose than
the down-and-out street drunks who had lost everything (except their
lives, which was next).
<p>
So what was that study?
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
You probably already know of this, but if not, you should.
I pretty sure that Narcotics Anonymous does an annual survey of their members that
includes stats like clean time, ethnic origin, salary, some details on upbringing.
I remember seeing some stats that showed that the people who recovered the longest were
white middle- and upper-class men with a good incomes.
It would be interesting to
compare results of any similar studies done on addicts who recovered by themselves.

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) &#8212; The stepmother of a suspected incest victim was the first to
guess the boy might have been sexually abused by his mother, the boy's father said
Thursday.

<p>
The 15-year-old boy's mother has been charged with first-degree sexual assault,
accused of having sex nightly with her teenage son when he was in seventh and eighth
grades. The Douglas County Attorney's office says the 41-year-old woman was released
Wednesday on $3,000 bond.

<p>
<!--------------
The Associated Press is not identifying the woman, or her son's father, to protect
the boy's identity as a possible victim of sexual assault.

<P>
The boy's mother did not immediately return a message left by the AP at her Fort
Calhoun, Neb., home.
--------------->

<p>
The teen's stepmother asked the high school sophomore about two weeks ago whether he
had been sexually assaulted, the boy's father said. The boy has lived with his
father and stepmother in Omaha for about the last 18 months.

<p>
&quot;I suspected something for years,&quot; the man said. &quot;I never thought it was sexual
abuse. I thought it could be physical or verbal abuse.

<p>
&quot;My wife ... just out of the blue asked him, 'Has someone assaulted you?' His reply
was nothing. His actions and his facial look told the answer.&quot;

<p>
He said he and his wife immediately took the boy to a counselor who had worked with
the boy in 2008, when the father gained custody of the boy. The teen told the
counselor that the abuse occurred while his mother was abusing prescription drugs,
the father said. It was the counselor who reported the alleged abuse to police.

<p>
Court records show the mother pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor after
being charged with intentionally violating narcotics laws. The Washington County
sheriff's office said the woman had been trying to fill 15 different prescriptions
from seven different doctors for 468 pills of the sleep aid Ambien or its generic
equivalent.

<p>
The woman was sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to attend Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings as part of a deal with prosecutors.

<p>
The boy's father, who was never married to the teen's mother, said his son seems to
have had an emotional burden lifted since reporting the abuse, noting that the boy's
grades have since improved.

<p>
&quot;I think the abuse had gone on for a long time,&quot; the father said. &quot;At one point, he
was thinking this is how normal people act &#8212; that this is what you do with your
mother.&quot;

<p>
<!----------
But the father said the 15-year-old is being hounded by an older half-brother &#8212; the
mother's oldest son &#8212; who lives in Lincoln. The older brother has been asking the
boy to change his story, the father said.

<P>
&quot;He came home early from school today because his brother got to him, telling him
he's lying and that it's not true,&quot; the father said. &quot;We don't know how to get away
from that right now.&quot;

<P>
The teen also has a younger half-brother, according to the teen's father and
authorities. Officials do not suspect the younger boy suffered any abuse, Douglas
County Attorney Don Kleine said Wednesday.

<P>
The youngest brother is 5 or 6 years old, the teen's father said, and is living with
his own father.

<P>
The mother will be represented by the Douglas County public defender's office;
public defender Tom Riley did not immediately return a message left by the AP on
Thursday. A preliminary hearing for the woman has been set for Feb. 8.

Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the story. It really is appalling how A.A. is used as a cure-all &#8212;
like sentencing a woman to A.A. for prescription drug abuse and child abuse, which
doesn't have much to do with alcohol.
But in A.A. she just might learn how to 13th-Step minors,
<a href="orange-letters14.html#underage" target="newwin30">like in this story</a>.
<p>
My move is still in progress &#8212; I still have to get a truck and a crew and
do the big move.  But I'm enjoying having my own place again, with absolutely nobody
else there, which is a big contrast from having 90 coughing guys around you all of
the time.
<p>
(Oh yeh, diseases are a major problem in shelters. You catch everything that
everybody else has, which means most every contagious disease that the city
has to offer. The guys fan out over the city during the day, working or looking
for work, or looking for housing, or whatever, and they collect every disease that
is around, and then they bring it all back to the shelter and share their diseases
with their neighbors at night.
The Pentagon should fund that shelter as a germ warfare laboratory.
I'm still getting over a cough that the place gave me as a going-away present.)

Hello,

<p>
I have read alot of what is written here and I wonder if its possible to
get documents that show that it is the truth you are telling about Neville
Chamberlain been in the inner circle of the Oxford group and Frank Buchman.

<p>
Where have you found that documents and where can I get them? I'm very
interested because it seems that you are the only one in the world that have
them.

<p>
From Mette E.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mette,
<p>
Thank you for the question. Happily, I am not the only one who has that information.
<a href="orange-rroot300.html#ftnt110_ret" target="newwin61">I got it from Peter Padfield</a>,
who wrote the biography of Heinrich Himmler called <i>Himmler, Reichsf&uuml;hrer</i>.
Peter Padfield is a well-known and respected historian.  At least one of
his books about the history of naval warfare
is published by the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis &#8212; <i>Armada</i>.
And his book
<i>D&ouml;nitz, the last F&uuml;hrer: portrait of a Nazi war leader</i>
is another biography of a World War II commander.

<p>
But please note that I never said that Chamberlain was part of the <b>inner circle</b>
of the Oxford Group. I just said that he was a member of the Oxford Group.

<p>
At the bottom of page 231 of <i>Himmler, Reichsf&uuml;hrer</i>, we see:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Canaris appears to have been playing both sides. While Abwehr Section II
stoked up the situation inside Czechoslovakia he sent his own emissaries to
warn London and acted as intermediary between Oster and Halder in the
preparations for an Army coup against Hitler. It is possible he had become
convinced of the mortal dangers into which Germany was being led and was
keeping his options open for a jump either way. On the other hand
few were better informed than he, Himmler and Heydrich that 'appeasement'
was ascendant in London &#8212; it is interesting that both Chamberlain and
Sir Horace Wilson were members of the Oxford Group &#8212; and Canaris'
special envoy on behalf of the 'opposition', von Kleist-Schmenzin,
reported in August that his arguments had got nowhere with Chamberlain.
From the trend of his message he might almost have been sent to
London to muddy the waters for the Goerdeler-Schacht group. Once
again there is more than a suspicion that Canaris remained a convinced
supporter of the F&uuml;hrer, and that his 'opposition' activities
were designed to incite and uncover anti-Nazi generals, delivering
them to Himmler who could seize them if they decided to act &#8212;
so winning great sympathetic support for Hitler and the regime &#8212; or
mark them if they did not, holding them to the line in future by
the threat of his surveillance and their own knowledge of guilt.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Himmler, Reichsf&uuml;hrer</i>, Peter Padfield, pages 231&#8212;232.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now Padfield did not include a footnote on the factoid of Chamberlain and Wilson
being members of the Oxford Group. I would also like to know where he got that particular
tidbit of information.
<p>
I read a review on the Internet of Padfield's <i>Himmler</i> book that stated that Padfield did no
new, original, research for the book, that he got the material for the book from six
other authoritative biographies of Himmler. I would like to know which one of them
stated that Chamberlain was in the Oxford Group, too.
<p>
Have a good day.

P.S.: (2010.05.28)<br>
I also found this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Chamberlain, who had believed in MRA, was disgraced. He had trusted Hitler too much.</br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The chapter on MRA is quite good,
quite revealing and descriptive, written by a first-hand witness who
knew his religions.
<p>
(Remember that MRA &#8212; Moral Re-Armament &#8212; was just the Oxford Group, renamed.)

From:  	&quot;chris l.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: Hello Mr. orange!!!<br>

<p>
thanks for getting back with me.  Let me just first start off saying I really hope I
make your letters section ha ha ha I'm one of your biggest fans.  Man I wish I had
half of the intelligence you do.  I have been reading your sight for so long now and
I am amazed at how thorough and precise it is.  Reading the letters makes me laugh
so hard especially when people say &quot;why don't you get a big book and actually read
it&quot;, when clearly you have read it because you have quoted like almost the entire
book ha ha ha.  Oh man good times.  I also love how  people keep attacking you but
can't really refute your arguments because you have built up a air tight argument
against AA.  Even when i was hard core into AA I would not have said some of the
things the people call you and say to you on here.  And wishing another alcoholic to
relapse is just shameful and disgusting.

<p>
Anyways a little about me. I'll try and make it short.  I got sent to AA on a second
DUI at 23 years old and had clearly known I had a drinking problem long before then
but was unable to stop.  One drink and I go non-linear as you like to put it, by the
way I'm stealing that saying cause i like it if that's OK? ha ha  I was sentenced to
90 days jail but when i went to start my sentence the jail was full so I got beach
cleanup instead.  I was the happiest person ever riding their bike to pick up trash
at the beach from 6am-3-pm you have ever seen because anything is better than jail.
<p>
Anyway so i met a guy while doing the beach cleanup and i said i had like 40 days
sober and he had like 2 years sober he was just cleaning up the wreckage of his
past.  He asked if i wanted to go to a meeting that night and i said sure.  He drove
me and when we got there it was a huge men's stag meeting with like 200 guys in it.
They were calling people up to the
podium to speak and my name got called, I was like WTF.  It turns out regulars
bring in new people and they don't tell the new guy but he is going to go up and
speak.  I thought this was rather rude because no one even asked me if i wanted
to.  Anyway now that i look back at it, it was part of the in doctrine i guess.  So
I spouted out the typical stuff just so I would be approved.  Like &quot;I have to get
honest&quot;, and &quot;trying to stay teachable&quot;, whatever.  Anyway so that guy was my
sponsor and I was going there for 1 year.  Man I feel so stupid after reading your
pages because i never even realized how AA is a cult.  Wow like really a cult.
<p>
Anyway I started noticing weird things but did not really acknowledge them at the
time.  One example was a guy started coming to the meeting that had 26 years off
drugs and alcohol and was a teacher of some kind but had NEVER been to an AA
meeting. He realized he was alcoholic very earlier on and just quit.
<p>
I remember telling my sponsor &quot;wow that is a long time to be sober&quot; and my sponsor
was like &quot;that guys not sober&quot;  I thought if you're not sober with 26 years off drugs
and alcohol then how long does it take?  Now I realize what he meant.  Sober is
doing 12 steps. Weird.
<p>
  Anyway in the one year I was at the meeting I saw everything
you describe in your pages.  13th stepping, which is disgusting to take advantage of
someone when they are messed up and new.  My sponsor told his other sponsee to stop
taking his medication, that the 12 steps would solve his problems, oh man
everything.
<p>
  Also the smoking thing was hilarious.  My sponsor smoked and let's face
it &#8212; almost 90% of people in AA smoke.
  I got lucky in that respect &#8212; I never started.  So
to this day it makes me laugh when people who smoke judge someone else's sobriety.  I
want to be like, &quot;Well you do realize you are taking drugs into your body right now.&quot;
I could easily tell them, &quot;You bet your ass
cigaretes are a mind altering drug. Look it up. So you technically don't even have
one day sober,&quot; but that's not my style.
<p>
  Anyway made it to step ten in the 12 steps
but nothing was happening in my life.  I felt like I was the only one not getting
what these people said they were getting.  I would pray and wait for the answers to
come but sadly no one talked to me from above and I had to make the decisions on my
own. Very confusing.  I'm like you &#8212; I guess I believe in something &#8212; it just does not
grant me wishes, it did not give me my alcoholism and it cannot take it away.  My
god is like &quot;Hey I gave you brains to use, use them.&quot;  Anyway so this is turning out
to be really long ha ha let me get to a couple of questions and also the couple
good things I like about AA.

<p>
So I think your one step is genious.  JUST DON'T TAKE THAT FIRST DRINK, NOT EVER NO
MATTER WHAT.  But I did have a great experience when doing the ninth step.  I hated
the other steps that made no sense to me but this one seemed human at least.  So I
had beat up my ex-girlfriend in a drunken night and that was the night we finally
broke up.  We had been together for 3 years and I had basically drank the whole
time.  I always told my self I would never hit a girl and thought those people were
cowards but it turned out to be me.  I make no excuse for what I did just becasue I
was drunk.  Anyway I attempted suicide after this because I hated myself so much.
But when I finally did the ninth step with her it was like a huge weight had been
lifted off my shoulders. I apologized and She said &quot;It's cool, it was a crazy time
for both of us&quot;.
<p>
  Anyways I guess I work two step program.  Your first step and then
apologize if I run into the people I have
hurt.  So I wanted to get your opinion on that step specifically? Is it
beneficial?
<p>
  Also I learned HALT in AA which is so funny cause it totally relates
to your lizard brain thing.  I turned it into HALTS.  So if you thinking about
drinking your probalby just H-Hungry A-Angry L-Lonely T-Tired or you need some
S-Sex.
<p>
  Also do you have any idea when they will stop sentencing people to AA from
courts and stuff?  Hello it's against the freaking constitution why do AA people
not care about that?  Like are they making headway on changing that?
<p>
  And last
question?  Oh I went to a Lifering meeting the other night &#8212; first non-12 step
meeting in Southern California &#8212; just started and I loved it.  Never even knew they
existed 'till I read your page. Thought AA was the only way. :-)  It was really
funny 'cause it was held in a church 'cause that's the only place they could get a
room and when we started laughing about how it was in a church, one of the guys in
there was like &quot;ah, the old bait and switch.&quot; I literally fell off my seat laughing.
<p>
So my last question is you say that if you go to AA meetings you become dependent
on them and you have to give the rest of your life to going to the meeting.  So I
guess I'm wondering is it the same &#8212; if you go to one Lifering meeting a week for the
rest of your life?  Because my biggest problem is I need to meet other people that
are sober constantly for the support and also I forget that I am an alcoholic.  At
least when i go to meeting where people talk about drinking, it makes me remember
how embarrasing all the things were that happened in my life due to drinking.
<p>
Anyway I hope I can talk to you from time to time.  I hope to meet you someday but
sadly I don't think that will happen.  Anyway I appriciate you getting the truth
out there.  No matter how much hate mail you get it's worth it in the long run if
you get one person out of the cult dogma ha ha (in my
oponion)
<p>
Also I love the pics of the ducks you have been taking, and are you still sober?  I
really hope so.  Anyway talk to you later

<p>
chris 26 years old

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Chris,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. It says a lot.
<p>
Well, to go down the list of questions:

<p>
<ol>

<p><li>
About making amends: I think that can be a good thing. When you clear the air with other
people, it lowers the paranoia level. For example, if you owe somebody money, you might
be worried about running into him and having him rag on you about getting paid back.
But once you have paid him, there is no more worry.
<p>
Similarly, when you clear the air with people about other things, then you don't
have to worry about it any more. And you don't have to keep on feeling guilty about it.

<p>
I just wouldn't make it a life-long practice. I mean, some of the more enthusiastic
Steppers are constantly examining themselves, just looking for faults to apologize for,
and make amends. That can drive you nuts after a while.
Just get the big stuff out of the way, and then get on with your life.
<p>
Also, consider whether the other person actually wants you to come and remind them
of some bad old times. Sometimes it's better to just let sleeping dogs lie, and forget it.

<p><li>
I like your take on HALT, or HALTS.  That sounds about right. Personally, the angry and
lonely items never had much effect on me, but the hungry and tired things would soon get
the lizard brain yammering about having a cigarette or a beer.

<p><li>
<a name="sue_judge"> </a>
<font color="black">
&quot;When they will stop sentencing people to AA from courts?&quot;<br>
</font>
Fat chance. That is the major A.A. recruiting method.
They do not care if it is illegal and unConstitutional. It brings more warm bodies
in the door. If they stop it, A.A. will really shrink.
<p>
But note that a recent appeals court decision, in Hawaii, I think,
 declared that if someone 
sentences you to a religion (like A.A.), you can sue them for it.
That includes suing the judge, the parole officer, a therapist or counselor,
or anybody else who infringes on your Constitutional rights. That is a really big
decision. That may be the beginning of the end of the A.A. coercive recruiting racket.
<p>
This is really big because until now, you could not sue the judge if you did not like
his decision. Judges have nearly total immunity from getting sued, no matter how
outrageous their rulings may be. But this is a giant
exception to the rule. A judge can be sued for sentencing someone to A.A.
because the judge is acting improperly and forcing someone into the 
religion of his choice.

<p><li>
The Lifering thing sounds good.  I have never been to a Lifering meeting personally,
because they do not have any meetings in this city. But I have exchanged a few letters
with them, and they seem like fine people. I would not worry about getting addicted
to the meetings. I don't think it works that way.  It's just like SMART, where they
expect you to go to meetings for a while, and then, when you have learned all that
you are going to learn there, you go out and get on with your life.
<p>
But you can come back for the social circle and friendships if you like. There is nothing
wrong with that.  And those meetings can be a good place to find friends who
don't want to party on drugs and alcohol.
<p>
And sure, going to a meeting every so often just for the reminders sounds okay.
Reminders are good. I get my reminders from some of the letters that I get.
<p>
The thing about a sensible organization like Lifering is that they are not poisoning
your mind with a bunch of cultish misinformation and put-downs and guilt-inducing
practices.
So I don't think it will hurt you to go to a bunch of Lifering meetings, and even make it
a regular habit if you like.
<p>
Some people go bowling every Thursday night, as a matter of habit, and some guys
play poker every Saturday night, without fail, and those habits are just what they feel
like doing. I wouldn't call any of it an &quot;addiction&quot;, really.


<p><li>
Yes, I'm still sober. I have more than nine years clean and sober now &#8212; no alcohol,
no tobacco, no drugs, no nothing except good Espresso coffee.
How sweet it is. My health has improved so much in the last nine years that it is
unreal. (Oh yeh, and I just had my annual physical. The doctor did a whole battery
of tests on me, and reported that
<font color="green"> 
&quot;ALL of your numbers are GREAT!&quot; 
</font> 
Literally.
That's what he wrote to me, including the capitalization. That's what
comes of not smoking cigarettes, and not drinking or drugging, and
making some small efforts to take care of my health, like eating better
and getting some exercize.)
</ol>

<p>
Have a good day and a good life. And feel free to correspond some more.

Just a note to say you've done a great job with this site, and to say I

I just thought this would be a good addition to your collection of sick
slights the 12-steppers perpetrate against those who disagree with them.
Someone suggested that perhaps the Hazelden 12-Steppers are 'reality
challenged'.

So, Hazelden is &quot;Reality challenged&quot;, huh?. Now that's good.
<p>
Okay, I read that PDF file.
Wow. That is quite a document. Thanks for a real jewel.
 That mess of illogical statements and contradictions
is something else.
<p>
First off, they parrot Bill Wilson's arrogant statements that non-cult-members
are &quot;confused&quot; about theological concepts and terminology.
Yep, anybody who disagrees with Bill's Buchmanite religion is
&quot;confused&quot; and &quot;struggling&quot; with spirituality.<br>

<p>
Then they claim that they have a
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;formula, based on 12-Step wisdom texts&quot;
</font>
for teaching spirituality. Wonderful! They should open
a seminary and train priests. Oh wait, they did, didn't they?

<p>
Then they claim that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The presenting addiction problem is lack of power and
that defines the solution &#8212; power. That power is spiritual and already is
part of everyone.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Then, in the next sentence,
 they make the completely illogical and contradictory statement that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Over-reliance on self blocks them from that power.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Since the power is mine, and is within me, I most assuredly should rely on my self.
I mean, I'm not going to learn to rely on the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy, not
when the power is within me.

<p>
Then they use lots of flowery phrases like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;At the Lodge we specialize in renovating our clients' spiritual programs.
&quot;
</font>
<p>
Yes, I guess his spiritual program needs a new roof, some shingles and tar.
<p>
Who says that the client even has or wants &quot;a spiritual program&quot;?
Some people want to quit drinking and smoking so much and get healthy.
<p>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We help guests rediscover their spirituality.&quot;
</font>
<p>
And to &quot;rediscover&quot; spirituality, I guess they must have already discovered it
once, right?
<p>

<p>
And this is good: The ravings of the pathological liar and incurable narcissist Bill
Wilson in the books <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> and <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>
are &quot;wisdom texts&quot;. Those Hazelden guys have a real bad case of
&quot;true-believer-ism&quot;, don't they?
<p>
Then they define alcoholism as a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;:
They claim that their client
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Revisits and reinforces the foundation of recovery &#8212; an
 understanding of the three dimensions (mind, body, and spirit) of the disease
of alcoholism.&quot;
</font>
== a crazy assertion for which there is not a scrap of real medical evidence.
There is no such thing as a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
<p>
Notice all of the nice-sounding fluff words
(<a href="orange-propaganda.html#glittering_generality" target="newwin98"><i>Glittering Generalities</i></a>):<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Reconnects, 'sequence of information', action, wisdom, Revisits, rediscovers,
 reinforces, foundation,
understanding, Reintegrates, recovery, Recreates, experience, spiritual...&quot;
</font>
<br>
You know, it takes some real talent to write such propaganda.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	I'm hurting...<br>

<p>
Hi Orange. I have been drawing from your site. Not sure if it's strength,
anger, resolve, defeat or what... I aways disliked the AA thing. That 1st
step is a doozy! After reading and jumping around and taking it it in as
best I can, I feel I know myself better and know what it is about AA that
bugs me.

<p>
Over and above what is killing me...

<p>
I married a swell gal in 1998. We were both touring road musicians ready to
settle down, but we wanted to keep on playing together &#8212;  and party together
too. We did that for some years, then four years ago in October my wife
decided she had taken her last drink. Her dad had done AA so it was a
natural for her too. She asked me to join with her but I was not ready and
even if I had been, I would not have wanted to go the AA route. Something
just did not smell right about it.

<p>
Anyway, she joined up and I kept drinking. This past year I was up to a
liter of the cheapest bourbon every week to ten days that I could find. It
might not sound like much to some, but to a gal who has been four years
sober? Attending meetings twice a week? A group leader? A sponsor?  A true
believer? It was enough to make her want to divorce me. She was terribly
hurt by my attitude toward AA. I did not try to hide it from her or lie
about my feelings. Maybe I should have. Maybe I should have just held my
nose and gone steppin' with her....

<p>
Now she's divorcing me. We have a six year old son... I have been sober
since August 27th 2009. But it's not enough. I'm doing it the wrong way! I'm a
&quot;dry drunk&quot;. I don't believe in AA and even if I went to meetings &#8212; 
(Actually I do. I always say, &quot;Hi I'm Pete and I'm a dry drunk&quot;) &#8212; I can't
tell her because she would be pissed that I was doing it to try to save our
marriage and not just for me... It was not just my drinking either. It was
step 4. She did her fearless moral inventory and it led her to the
conclusion that we are too fundamentally different in our basic
personalities &#8212; that we never would have gotten married in the first place
if we had not been drunk...

<p>
The final piece of the puzzle? The bass player in her current band has a
marriage that's falling apart because his wife is drinking destructively. I
don't know if the guy is a drinker himself or a member of the fellowship. I
don't know if he's in Al-Anon. But you see where this is going? He told her
about his troubles, she told him about hers and of course that naturally
leads to an affair... It doesn't sound like the classic 13th step, but it
doesn't have to. It's bad enough whatever you call it.

<p>
Oh my Dog I'm fucked up about this! I can't change her mind. I can't get her
to see the that if there is to be future for us and most importantly for our
innocent son, that she has to forget about the past. But something has
clicked inside her and she has gotten are hard nosed and prickly. I can't
even point out something as obviously messed up as the fact that when she
told me about this guy and the fact that now she wanted a divorce, she was
sucking down tokes of pot to calm her nerves! I think I'll tell her sponsor
about it. It would be at about the same level of maturity...

<p>
Please Orange. Words man, words. I need some wisdom. I can control my
drinking but I can't control the AA person she has become. It worked for her
and that's good, but it is savaging me... and my poor son...

<p>
Pete

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Pete,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer &#8212; I've been homeless and looking for a new
place to live, due to 
<a href="orange-letters150.html#Pacific" target="Newwin17">a draconian new property
 management company</a>
driving me out of my apartment.
But I have a nice new place to live now, so I'm back to answering letters.

<p>
I hate to be pessimistic, but I think that you actually answered your own question
in one of the last lines of your letter:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;I can control my drinking but I can't control the AA person she has become.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Exactly. That is the hell of relationships. You cannot control the other person.
You can only control yourself, and hope that things will work out okay with the other person.
But the other person can do whatever she feels like doing.

<p>
Still, I'm not saying that all is lost. She could still wake up, although the odds
are not good.
<p>
I think it might help to learn some techniques for awakening cult members.
Steven Hassan wrote two books about that, called
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB"><i>Releasing the Bonds:

I have mentioned them before, several times, and described some useful things in them, and

From:  	&quot;frank t.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	a book &quot; the twelve preciepts of AA&quot;<br>

<p>
Thank You for giving me actual proof that other human beings see through the
bullshit

<p>
While in  jail in Rockland Me. 1987, I came across The twelve Preciepts of
AA.

<p>
That summer I became aware of this viel of darkness permeating the country.

<p>
It was Bush vs Duckakis, and this was the first attempt of national
brainwashing that I was aware of.

<p>
I had settled into a Hindu philosophy of evolving through higher states of
consciousness. That there was no &quot;evil&quot; and the conflicts of humanity was do
to ignorance, and the planet would eventually evolve into a state of
Nirvana.

<p>
The summer of 87,I was aware of this energy, &quot;a dark energy&quot; materializing
around me.  Everything was co -opted by this energy, the press, radio,
television. I thought that I really lost my mind, even family and friends
were alien to me.

<p>
For some reason my energy and the energy of those around me  was like water
and oil. Individuals and groups of people were so hostile , I thought that I
would be killed. Just for speaking my mind with respect to the election, or
evangelical

<p>
Christianity, or human values such as justice, economic justice, bigotry, it
was totally directed to me. I experimented

<p>
To make sure I wasn't delusional, it was accurate.

<p>
So I decided to travel to Vinalhaven Me. an island off the coast of
Rockland.  I figured that if sanity was to be found it would be among
lobstermen eight miles off the mainland. As I traveled up the coast I could
see this darkness spreading

<p>
up the coast as I drove.

<p>
I was wrong, I wound up in jail, even my cell mates were affected.

<p>
So I found the Twelve Precepts, in an obscure small time jailhouse that had
magazines ten years old , a lot of Christian

<p>
Books and AA  material coming out of the ying yang.

<p>
I was not a devote' of AA , two years earlier a motorcycle gang leader that
I sold pot was busted.

<p>
He owed me money so I waited a year and one half until he came out to talk
to him.

<p>
He had become a penacostal minister, and AA rising star. He told me that I
was the devil, and he didn't have to pay me because it was ill-gotten gains.
I had too many other things going on , I could not jeopardize them ,fucking
with this guy.

<p>
The whole point of this is , how did a tough Motorcycle scumbag become a
preacher, and AA superstar in a year.

<p>
So I knew all about AA and their ability to brainwash, what amazed me was
their lack of selectivity in the people that represented them.

<p>
The answer I found in The Twelve precepts.

<p>
The first precept is  DO NOT FLAUNT YOUR WEALTH SO AS TO BRING CURIOSITY TO
YOURSELF AND THE ORGANIZATION

<p>
The second precept  IF YOU ARE BEING ATTACKED IN PUBLIC ALWAYS MAINTAIN YOUR
COMPOSURE, SHOW NO ANGER,

<p>
PROJECT A SMILING FACE , WE HAVE OTHERS IN THE ORGANIZATION WHO ARE TRAINED
TO HADLE THOSE THINGS.

<p>
In the pages that described how this group was able to infiltrate the
organization of AA and take it over , without anybody knowing, they spelled
it out completely.

<p>
These people accumulated through AA and other help groups ( AA is one of
many groups that are associated at the top,

<p>
but remain invisible and appear to be independent of each other) their prey
is the misfits of society, they are set up to capture the most vulnerable
among us.

<p>
This capturing has been going on through all levels of society and
government institutions for at least sixty years in this country. The people
who were managing World War II , came to the U.S.to finish what was started
in Europe .

<p>
I'm sure the lineage goes all the way back to the agreement with jehovah.

<p>
This country is close to being checkmated, from my position the only thing
that will prevent it  is &quot;CITIZEN CENTRAL&quot;

<p>
Sorry for leaving some for you to explore , but I have been dealing with
this shit since 1987.I'm tired of banging by head against the wall for
fellow human beings, I had made my last appeal in Commondreams .org a couple
of days ago under the name urganda. I don't like bad guys winning, but who
knows maybe the species in ordained for extinction.

<p>
I come from another time and space, this is not my gig I'm just passing
through.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Frank,
<p>
Well, the way I see it, either of two things is happening:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
When you see the darkness and the dark energy materializing, closing in around you,
 and permeating everything, it
is time to see a doctor. It isn't a matter of being crazy, it's a matter of brain
chemicals being out of balance, shoving you into a paranoid state.
Please, see a doctor.
<p><li>
You may be undergoing a spiritual awakening &#8212; an increase of awareness &#8212; but
your new vision is tinted by negative thoughts.
<p>
Many years ago, back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a character named Art Kleps
founded what he called &quot;The Neo-American Church&quot;, and he called himself &quot;The Chief
Boohoo&quot; of the church.
  In spite of his joking approach to organization, he had some great things
to say. One of his essays talked about what he called &quot;the Plot/plot&quot;.  He said that
as you awaken, you begin to see the interconnectedness of everything in the Universe,
and you see the Cosmic Coincidentality of so many events. You begin to see that everything
is part of some great plan.
But you can interpret that in either of two ways:
<p>
<ol type="a">
<li> If you are in a positive frame of mind, you see it all as a Divine Plan where everything
fits in just right, and the Universe is unfolding just as it should, like a rose blooming.
 That is the &quot;Plot&quot;, with a capital 'P'.
<li> Or, if you are in a negative frame of mind, you see it all as a gigantic evil conspiracy, a
nefarious plot (lower-case 'p'), where <i>everybody</i>
 is working together to do bad things and create Hell on Earth.
</ol>
<p>
You are seeing the same events in both cases, but your interpretation of them
is completely different, just the opposite, and hence, what you think you are seeing is different.
</ol>
<p>
So which is it? I don't know. It could even be a little of both. Chemical imbalances
in the brain can also cause heightened awareness. Ask any old acid-head (like me).
 So please see a doctor, to make sure that the brain chemistry is okay, and then
get some practice that gets you meditating or thinking about positive things
each day. It may be very hard to believe, but just a slight shift in your viewpoint
can suddenly have you standing in the Light, with all of the love of the universe
streaming down on you.

<p>
Nevertheless, I have to agree with some of your observations, like,
<font color="black">
&quot;how did a tough Motorcycle scumbag become a preacher, and AA superstar in a year&quot;?
</font>
<p>
Yeh, really...

<p>
I wish you health and happiness. So have a good day now.

Subject:  	Intervention for AA brainwashed hubby<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I was wondering if there is some way I can have an intervention done on my husband
who has been brainwashed by AA.... is there some kind of book I can give to him or
handout or even a group I can take him to that might explain things to him. OR is
there something you can suggest I do to help save my husband from the AA cult?

<p>
One thing I noticed since my husband has been involved with AA for the past three
years is that most all people who are in AA end up getting divorced from their
spouses or the spouses get involved in the other 12 step programs..... but if NOT
divorce is the only answer.
<p>
Please help me..... I have been married for 24 years and can't bear to see my husband
lose his mind to AA.

<p>
Thanks for your help

<font color="blue">
Hello Rose,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
<p>
The word &quot;intervention&quot; puts me off, because I haven't seen any evidence that
they work. They seem to cause a lot more harm than good.
What seems to work best is letting people slowly go through their changes themselves,
rather than trying to force the issue.
<p>
That does not mean that there aren't things that you can do.
<p>
This line sounds so true:

<font color="black">
...most all people who are in AA end up getting divorced from their
spouses or the spouses get involved in the other 12 step programs..... but if NOT
divorce is the only answer.
</font>
<p>
Yes, I've been seeing the same thing too.  A.A. is better at causing divorces
than at causing sobriety. People write to me, and tell me their stories,
and the list of A.A.-caused divorces is just constantly growing.

<p>
And yet, Bill Wilson had the gall to write this piece of fantasy in his second book:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Permanent marriage breakups and separations, however, are unusual in A.A.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 117.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I think it might help to learn some techniques for awakening cult members.
Steven Hassan wrote two books about that, called
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB"><i>Releasing the Bonds:
Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>, and
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="newwin89"><i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i></a>.
I have mentioned them before, several times, and described some useful things in them, and
the list of those descriptions is
<a href="orange-letters144.html#Hassan" target="newwin18">here</a>.
So follow that link, and you will get several suggestions for how to work
with someone who is cult-indoctrinated. It may help.
<p>
Good luck, and have a good day now.
