While searching for current comments on Alcoholics Anonymous in blogs (10 Feb 2006),
I stumbled across the following mangled sentences:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For these folks rehab may be the only choice to quit drinking alcohol.
Alcohol rehab had been made public throughout such organizations as AA,
Alcoholics Anonymous, as well as other famous institutions that treat
alcohol connected issues. As long as alcohol consumption becomes an issue,
rehab may be the one and only option. Families have been destroyed,
lives torn apart, and some people have lost everything over becoming
addicted to alcohol. Alcohol rehabilitation is critical because it can
bring back a promising life that is on the brink of disaster. Their
environment and friends can at times be environments that cause drinking
impractical to stop. rehabilitation can be the only option for some people.<br>

<b>teenage drug abuse</b>
<p>
One of these, a commonly known organization, is Alcoholics Anonymous,
where alcoholics share there experiences with each other, and aide one
another during the tough times. This can help alot, particularly with
the emotional aspect of it all. a good deal people may feel depressed,
be unable to sleep, and have vivid nightmares when going through withdrawal,
and also many other side-effects. Having someone to share this with and
knowing that others are going amidst the same, can have an elevated impact.
My advice to one or your loved one, join group therapy if at all possible,
you wont regret it. And dont worry, many of them are no where near what
you see in FightClub, it is, after-all, a movie. There exist drug rehab
groups for all kinds of addictions.<br>

I discovered that 'Kevin' was quite a prolific poster.
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231042/http://www.blogger.com/profile/17083191">See his profile</a>.
And all of his 'blogs' seemed to end with a statement that if you think
you might need detoxing, you should go
look at the web page
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231042/http://www.mydetoxplan.com/">http://www.mydetoxplan.com/</a>,

&#8212; Kevin's other sideline: Selling air ionizers and air cleaners
</ul>



<p>
Then, when Kevin got tired off giving us advice on how to detox and recover, Kevin changed
into Michelle. Michelle had exactly the same things to say, and used the same
blog server, and even used the same
backgrounds for her blogs and used many of the same sentences in the same
paragraphs with the same grammatical errors.
Michelle also invariably steered us to the web site on detox diet at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103231042/http://www.mydetoxplan.com/">http://www.mydetoxplan.com/</a>, which says,
among other things,
<p>
<blockquote>

<p>
And when you wade through all of the bull, you find that it is all a vehicle for
carrying advertisements for &quot;Native Remedies Detox Drops&quot;,

Then Michelle became Sarah, and Sarah used the same sentences to say the same things too.

The ultimate goal is to foresee what drives the person inside to drink
alcohol in quantities that are unhealthy. Alcohol rehab, despite a
Hollywood cliche, is in effect a honorable action that everyone who
sufferers from addiction to alcohol can take. rehabilitation helps educate
and bring paradigm shifts to the sufferer who may have never seen alcohol
in a healthy light. rehab is a spot that one can go to find an answer
to a situation with alcohol that they cant come up with on their own.<br>

<p>
Overcoming a drug addiction is not anything that is done overnight.
It requires time and perserverence in order to succeed. Hence, a
necessary factor in overcoming drug addictions, is indeed, perserverence,
and will power. For example, the average smoker has to attempt quitting
8 times until they quit for good!

<b>spiritual rehabilitation for drugs and alcohol</b>

Given that alcohol consumption gets an issue, rehabilitation may be the

some individuals have lost everything over becoming addicted to alcohol.
rehab can be the one and only option for some people. Alcohol rehabilitation
has been made public with such organizations as AA, Alcoholics Anonymous,

<b>adolescent drug rehabilitation</b>
<p>
Alcohol rehab is critical because it can bring back a promising life
that is on the brink of disaster. Their environment and friends can at
times be environments that make drinking impractical to stop. For these
folks rehabilitation may be the only choice to quit drinking alcohol.
Alcohol rehabilitation has been made public throughout such organizations
as AA, Alcoholics Anonymous, as well as other famous institutions that
treat alcohol related issues. Given that alcohol consumption becomes an
issue, rehab may be the only option.<br>

</ul>

<p>
Jessica also treated us to this advice:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alcohol rehabilitation has been made public amidst such organizations
as AA, Alcoholics Anonymous, as well as other famed institutions that
treat alcohol related issues.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Their surroundings and friends can at times be
environments that force drinking impossible to stop.<br>

http://blog-bowel.blogspot.com/2006/02/drug-and-alcohol-inpatient-rehab.html</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Overcoming a drug addiction is not an issue that is done overnight.
Thus, a necessary factor in overcoming drug addictions, is indeed,
perserverence, and will power.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of which, a typically known organization, is Alcoholics Anonymous,
where alcoholics share there experiences with each other, and assist
one another through the difficult times. This can help alot, especially
with the emotional aspect of it all. a good amount of people may feel
depressed, be not able to sleep, and have vivid nightmares when going
into withdrawal, along with many other side-effects. Having someone to
share this with and appreciating that other people are going amidst the
same, can have a great impact.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
But Alcoholics Anonymous says that your will power is useless because
you are &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
So if you are going to quit by using your own perseverence and will power,
better not listen to the pundits at Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
And then Jessica morphed into Jack, who was also a proponent of
&quot;Christian&quot; rehab.

<p>
And Jack had the same things to say, too:
<p>
<blockquote>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And I love this. &quot;Jack&quot; says that &quot;Christian drug rehabilitation center&quot;
isn't as bad as Fight Club:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
a good amount of people may feel depressed, be unable to sleep, and have
vivid nightmares when going amidst withdrawal, along with many other
side-effects. Having a person to share this with and knowing that other
people are going amid the same, can have an elevated impact. There are
drug rehab groups for all types of addictions. My advice to you or your
loved one, join group therapy if at all possible, one wont regret it.
And do not worry, many of them are no where near what you see in FightClub,
it's, after-all, a movie. One of such, a commonly famed organization,
is Alcoholics Anonymous, where alcoholics share there experiences with
themselves, and help one another through the tough times. This can help
alot, truly with the emotional aspect of it all.<br>

<p>
Then Jack became Howard, who also has a side-line business of selling portable air ionizers.
<p>

Howard:

<b>addiction drug rehab treatment</b>
<p>
Checking into rehab at the onset of alcoholism may hold off serious civil
consequences, such as loss of job, divorce, or tearing a family apart.
Alcohol rehabilitation is a choice that should not be left as a last
resort. If you feel that somebody you love may be at risk and may be
able to benefit from alcohol rehab, dont hesitate to check into what
alcohol rehab programs are available in Ones area. Alcohol rehab has
saved many lives in greater amount of ways than one. A life can be saved
throughout a simple and effective alcohol rehab service. Education and
environment can be reached with the right alcohol rehabilitation program.<br>
