Because the Twelve Steps are not a program for quitting
drinking, it is easy to change them
into something else that is not a program for getting off of
drugs, or not a program for avoiding
over-eating, or not a program for fixing whatever else you don't like. 
Just edit Step One, and change the
words &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; to &quot;powerless over
our addiction&quot;, or &quot;powerless over our food compulsion&quot;, or
whatever else you want to be powerless over, and then edit Step
Twelve, and change the word
&quot;alcoholics&quot; to &quot;addicts&quot;, or
&quot;overeaters&quot;, or whatever, and <i>Hey Presto!</i> you have a
new &quot;spiritual&quot; program for unsuccessfully treating some other problem or
&quot;spiritual disease.&quot;
I hear that there are now over two hundred of these clone
twelve-step programs, intended to cure (or not cure, but &quot;treat&quot;) just about everything
imaginable. Some of them sound
pretty wild, like Artists in Recovery, or Partners of Sexaholics.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
(I just can't help but wonder, is
that last group complaining or bragging?)
<p>
(And in my wild imagination, I can see an <i>Artists in Recovery</i>
meeting where a dozen crazy paint-stained guys with berets and only one ear talk
about how they really have to stop drinking that absinthe...)
</font>
</blockquote>
<p><br>

The last time we had a universal medicine that would cure so
many different ailments, it was the snake oil sold by the
traveling medicine shows.
<p>
The rest of the program, besides those words in Steps One
and Twelve, is always the same. In fact, in most all of the 12-Step
programs, Steps Two through Eleven are word-for-word identical to
the Alcoholics Anonymous steps.

Some of these groups offer their own minor variations

<p>
Notice the funny mix of so-called &quot;spiritual diseases&quot; there:
you can &quot;cure&quot; some of them just by changing your behavior, like
alcoholism, narcotics, smoking, over-eating, sex addiction,
gambling, cocaine, or being a compulsive shopper or a clutterer.
But the others are not what we might call
&quot;voluntary&quot; diseases.
You cannot just voluntarily quit having high blood pressure,
diabetes, hepatitis C, chronic illness,
dual disorder (i.e.: having both mental and drug or alcohol problems)
or schizophrenia, so I really want to hear how listing and confessing
all of your sins, &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, and
&quot;defects of character&quot; will cure those diseases.
<p>
<a name="exploit"> </a>
Someone would have to be pretty crazy to think that doing the
Twelve Steps &#8212; performing a searching and fearless moral
inventory and confessing all of his sins &#8212; is going to cure
mental illnesses like schizophrenia and compulsive-obessive disorders.
<p>
But, come to think of it, that's just how the game works, isn't it?
Go find sick, vulnerable people who are suffering, whose
minds aren't too clear, and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#desperate" target="_blank">exploit their weaknesses</a> and
talk them into joining a cult religion while telling them that this
magical 12-Step program will heal what ails them.

The children's groups are strange, too. They are the groups like
Al-Anon, Alateen, and ACOA &#8212; Adult Children of Alcoholics.
Those groups teach that because
someone was born to alcoholic parents, he should spend the rest of
his life doing the Twelve Steps.
Didn't Alcoholics Anonymous say that the
Twelve Steps were a program for quitting drinking? Those children
don't drink, and never have.

A book that is popularly known as &quot;The Serenity Bible&quot;

That you have picked up
<i>Serenity</i><font face="Times,Roman,Sanserif"><sup>&reg;</sup></font>
probably
means that you or someone you love is already involved in or considering
joining a Twelve Step program of recovery. We embark on recovery
as a means of seeking freedom from any one or more of a number
of addictive agents. Addictive agents are those persons or things
on which we form an excessive dependency.
The catalog of addictive agents includes:
<ol>
<li> Alcohol or drugs
<li> Work, achievement, and success
<li> Money addictions, such as overspending, gambling, hoarding
<li> Control addictions, especially if they surface in personal,
sexual, family, and business relationships
<li> Food addictions
<li> Sexual addictions
<li> Approval dependency (the need to please people)
<li> Rescuing patterns toward other persons
<li> Dependency on toxic relationships (relationships that
are damaging and hurtful)
<li> Physical illness (hypochondria)
<li> Exercise and physical conditioning
<li> Cosmetics, clothes, cosmetic surgery, trying to look good on the outside
<li> Academic pursuits and excessive intellectualizing
<li> Religiosity or religious legalism (preoccupation with the
form and the rules and regulations of religion, rather than
benefiting from the real spiritual message)
<li> General perfectionism
<li> Cleaning and avoiding contamination and other obsessive-compulsive
symptoms
<li> Organizing, structuring (the need always to have everything in its place)
<li> Materialism
</ol>

<p>
That list of so-called &quot;addictions&quot; is, of course, absurd,
and even insane. According to the authors,
just about everything, good or bad, is an addiction.
And they apparently don't even know the difference between real
physical illnesses and hypochondria (item 10). They use the title of
doctor, but they surely are not medical doctors.
(One is a psychologist and the other runs &quot;a Christian counselling
clinic in Dallas, Texas&quot;.)
But no matter &#8212; they will prescribe the same 12-Step quack cure
no matter what your ailment may be.

But for sheer goofy wackyness, it's hard to beat Clutterers Anonymous:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...chapters of Clutterers Anonymous, a 12-step recovery program for
compulsive accumulators, are also springing up all over the country.
There are now groups in 50 cities in 17 states, including two chapters
in Pennsylvania, where participants learn the self-help, growth and
healing principles that have proven so successful in programs such as
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>

Clutterers Anonymous, or CLA, was formed in 1989 in Simi Valley, Calif.,
after several women who were doing work in Overeater's Anonymous learned
that they were also either pack-rats, or married to one, according to
Christy B., of the CLA World Service Organization. As with other 12-step
groups, the members don't reveal their last names.
<p>

The 12 steps embody a set of principles that promote inner change, she
says. &quot;We're not about teaching organizational skills, housecleaning
tips or time management,&quot; she says. &quot;We focus on the tools of
recovery that address and free us from the underlying causes of clutter.&quot;

<!----------------------------  -->
The process has worked wonders for Ruth S., a licensed professional
addictions counselor in Montgomery County, who discovered the program
through group workshops.
<p>
Through attending meetings and workshops and working closely with her
own sponsor or &quot;clutter buddy,&quot; Ruth says she has been able
to understand the kind of behavior that has led her to be constantly
surrounded by physical and emotional chaos.

<p>
&quot;It helped me to see my home as a sacred space, and to understand
how removing clutter from my life &#8212; internally and externally &#8212; has
really helped me gain clarity and control,&quot; she says.

It begins to look like the real purpose of these twelve-step

12-Step religion, not to cure anything.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
Of course. That has always been the objective.

<p>

&quot;The Oxford Groups&quot; &#8212; by
<i>&quot;Working The Steps&quot;</i> and
<i>&quot;Seeking and Doing the Will of God&quot;</i>.
Bill Wilson even said so, very clearly:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Six months earlier,
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#stock_broker" target="_blank">the broker</a> [Bill Wilson]
had been relieved of his drink obsession by a sudden spiritual
experience, following a meeting with an alcoholic friend who had been in
contact with the Oxford Groups of that day. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;

Though he could not accept all the tenets of the Oxford Groups, he was
convinced of the need for moral inventory, confession of personality
defects, restitution to those harmed, helpfulness to others, and the
necessity of belief in and dependence upon God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, pages xv and xvi of the
Foreword.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>(In other words, he did accept all of the tenets of the Oxford Groups, but he
didn't want to admit that his so-called &quot;sobriety program&quot; was just a copy
of Frank Buchman's cult religion.)</i>
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the
spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them.

Then Bill Wilson schemed to recruit the alcoholics' entire families into his cult religion:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Though an alcoholic does not respond, there is no reason why you should
neglect his family. You should continue to be friendly to them.
The family should be offered your way of life. Should they accept
and practice spiritual principles, there is a much better chance
that the head of the family will recover. And even though he continues
to drink, the family will find life more bearable.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 7, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>Notice how Bill suddenly changed the advertised effect of his &quot;spiritual&quot;
Twelve-Step program from making alcoholics quit drinking to just making
the family's life &quot;more bearable&quot;.
Are the 12 steps really a program for recovery from alcoholic drinking, or are
they really something else?<br>
</i></font>
<font color="#9F0000">
Well, the truth is that the Steps are really a religion for the whole family, just like the
Oxford Group was.
</font>
<p>
And lastly, Bill wrote in the Foreword to the <i>Big Book</i> that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We think this account of our experiences will help everyone to better
understand the alcoholic. Many do not comprehend that the alcoholic
is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure that our way of living
has its advantages for all.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson,
in the Foreword to the First Edition,
page xiii of the 3rd edition.</font>

<p>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;<font color="#9F0000"><b>And besides</b></font>,
it will be wonderful if we can
<a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt022" target="_blank">convert
everybody in the world</a> to our religion,
to 'our way of living', and have all of them under
'<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">God-control</a>',
following the dictates of a Higher Power,
doing the Twelve Steps, and seeking and doing the Will of God as we
understand it...&quot;
</i></font>
</blockquote>


<p>
And Bill's followers have tried hard to make that ambition a reality, cloning the
Twelve-Step program into a couple of hundred other groups that will
supposedly treat an absurdly large and all-inclusive list of ailments, which makes everyone
in the world a candidate for twelve-step salvation, in one guise or
another, for some disease or other, real or imagined.
<p>
<ul>
<li> The first clone was Al-Anon, for the wives and children of alcoholics.
<li> And then there was Alateen, just for the teenagers.
<li> Then there was ACOA, Adult Children of Alcoholics, where you can
confess your miserable choice of parents.
<li> Then they started 12-Step groups for drug addicts and compulsive gamblers &#8212;
Narcotics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous.

<li> Then it got really ridiculous, with groups that are downright bizarre,
groups to &quot;treat but not cure&quot;
high blood pressure, Hepatitis C, diabetes, chronic illness, compulsive
shopping, over-eating, schizophrenia, and being the partner of a sex addict, all
by doing the Twelve Steps and confessing all of your sins,
defects of character, and moral shortcomings, and then surrendering your mind
and your will...
</ul>


<p><br><center><img src="/web/20161017091358im_/https://www.orange-papers.org/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

Europeans regard that routine as pretty silly. Something that
the 12-Step true believers will never tell you is that Europe
manages to handle its drug and alcohol problems without the
Twelve Steps. Oh, the 12-Step organizations have branches over
there, of course, but they are not nearly as popular as in the
USA, and they do not dominate their nations' treatment programs
like the Steppers do in the USA.
<p>
Twelve-Step recovery is a distinctly American phenomenon, just
like Puritanism is a distinctly American phenomenon.
<p>
British researchers see it this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The application of AA dogmas to behaviours which could scarcely be termed
&quot;diseases&quot; &#8212; shopping, for instance &#8212; with all the paraphernalia
about recognizing these as illnesses over which one has no control, has a
faintly ludicrous quality. Their acceptance by many Americans testifies to
the fact that what we are witnessing here is a socio-religious phenomenon requiring
of followers the confession and repentance through which they receive status
and acceptance.
<p>
Hence the attempt to explain alcohol problems, as well as other drug problems,
in non-disease terms not only steps on commercial toes by threatening the
theoretical basis for disease-based treatment programmes, it also threatens
an entire social movement by asserting that there are other means of breaking
habits than by confession and repentance.<br>

A.A. and the other 12-Step groups like to claim that the 12-Step program

candidate for the title of &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
It practices battering, just like a cruel, vicious, wife-battering husband:
<p>
<ol>
<li> First, the husband is friendly and loving, but then he turns on his
wife and threatens and beats her.
<li> Just when the wife is ready to leave, the battering
husband reverts to being loving and reassuring, telling the wife that
things will be better in the future and that he didn't really mean it
and he loves her.
<li> Then, when the wife stays, the husband soon reverts to attacking
and beating her again.
<li> Then, just when the wife is ready to leave, the battering
husband reverts to being loving and reassuring again.
<li> Eventually, the battered wife is so paralyzed by confusion and
fear that she doesn't know if she is coming or going.
<li> And worse yet, while all of that is going on, the husband convinces
the wife that it is her fault &#8212; that her bad behavior is the problem.
She starts to think: &quot;Maybe if I was a better wife, he wouldn't
get so angry. I must try harder to be a good wife and please him.&quot;
Thus, he gradually destroys what little self-respect and self-confidence
the wife has left, which makes it even harder for her to leave him.
</ol>

<p>
A.A. and Al-Anon foist the same back-and-forth routine on their victims:
<p>
<ul>
<li> First you are good, then you are bad, then you are good, then you are bad...
<p>
<li> You are powerful, then you are powerless. First you are powerful and responsible for your own fate,
and responsible for your quitting drinking,
and then you are powerless and your will power is useless...
<p>
<li> You are not responsible for what was done to you.... Then you are guilty of all
kinds of defects and sins... Then you are not responsible... And then you are guilty...<br>
<p>
<li> First it's a disease over which you are powerless, and then you are a sinner who is selfish
and self-seeking and manipulative and dishonest and self-centered....
<p>
<li> In the Al-Anon 3rd Step, &quot;God&quot; supposedly loves you so
much that He will take care of your will and your life for you,
and solve all of your problems forevermore, just because you demand that
He do so. That builds up your ego and gives you delusions of grandeur
where you imagine that God is your butler, waiting on you hand and foot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But then the 4th through 7th Steps, where you make long lists
of everything that is wrong with you, and dwell on it and confess it
all to man and God, just continue the routine of having an
angry alcoholic father constantly criticizing everything that you do,
tearing you down, destroying your ego and your self-respect,
and making you feel guilty about everything.
</ul>

One night, God sent me a beautiful spiritual awakening. When I was the young daughter of an
alcoholic father, I was powerless. I was powerless over every criticism that came from his mouth,
and I was powerless over every blow he struck against me. To survive such an upbringing,
I developed many defenses. When no longer needed, those defenses became character defects.

Drunk on feelings? There is no such thing. Having intense feelings is not the same
thing as being intoxicated by ethyl alcohol. What this woman is actually describing is
a cyclical mental disorder like a manic-depressive or bipolar disorder, where the victim
cycles between extreme emotional states, up and down, up and down.
Being flipped out in a manic state is not being &quot;drunk on feelings&quot;, and
it is not an &quot;emotional binge&quot;.

Al-Anon also got it from the Oxford Group, which taught Bill Wilson all of his cult
religion dogma.
Beverly Nichols, a contemporary journalist and former member of the Oxford Group,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Nichols_4Abs" target="_blank">described the Oxford Group
dogma and their treatment of wives</a> this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>Absolute Unselfishness</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I should have to bring a whole collection of family skeletons rattling out of the cupboard to
explain why I mistrust this apparently spotless ideal. All I care to say here is that I have
seen several people's lives brought to the brink of ruin because of
one woman's absolute unselfishness. If you strip this vague and mushy ideal to its
essentials, how does it reveal itself?
As a complete abrogation of the rights of the individual concerned.
For example, an absolutely unselfish wife must endure, year in and year out, the
persecution of a drunkard. She must never assert herself, never speak harshly to him,
never protest when he revolts her sensibilities, terrifies her children, turns her
house into a lunatic asylum, gambles away her money.
<font color="blue">
'It is not <i>him</i>,' she must say. 'It is a disease.'</font>
Or again: 'I took him for better or for worse; I must
endure to the end.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such women exist by the thousand; the Oxford Group approves of them; I do not.
They are magnificent but mad.
Unselfishness, if carried to these extremes, is an obsession that does nothing
but prolong unnecessary pain. (Read Stefan Zweig's <i>Beware of Pity</i>.)<br>
</font>

<i>All I Could Never Be</i>, Beverly Nichols, pages 262-266.

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Note that Beverly Nichols was describing the situation in the Oxford Group back in the
nineteen-twenties and -thirties.
The excuse that alcoholism is a disease was already common then.
The disease concept of alcoholism did not originate with Bill Wilson, Alcoholics Anonymous, or
Dr. William D. Silkworth, either. Bill Wilson did not invent or discover anything when
he created the A.A. cult; he just copied the Oxford Group.

These Twelve-Step programs become truly bizarre when they
are used to &quot;heal&quot; the victims
of crimes, like the Survivors of Incest, or the abused Adult
Children of Alcoholics. To what
moral shortcoming or defect of character should a little girl who
is getting raped by her father,
brother, and uncle confess? The sin of being too pretty? And
how does she make amends to all whom she has harmed?

<p>
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<a name="molested"> </a>
<p>
Apparently, some Twelve-Steppers do not find that to be a
problem: As unbelievable as it
may seem, Ken Ragge, in the book <i>More Revealed</i>, recounts
an instance from personal experience in
which an A.A. member who as a
boy had been sexually molested by a priest, made
&quot;amends&quot; to the priest by apologizing for being
angry about the molestation. Ragge also recounts another episode
in which a woman who had
been gang raped was urged to make &quot;amends&quot; to the
rapists.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

<p>
All I can say is, <b><i>&quot;Man, these are really some sick
puppies.&quot;</i></b>
<p>

<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
In addition, the victims of rape or molestation are routinely
told to &quot;find their own part in it.&quot; Like,
<font color="green">
&quot;Well, if I hadn't
dressed nice and made myself look good, then he wouldn't have
wanted to rape me. So the rape must be my own fault.&quot;
</font>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#no_anger" target="_blank">Victims are not
allowed to be angry</a> or to
harbor &quot;resentments&quot;. The victims are supposed to just
dwell on their own role in the incident, and forgive the

Rebecca Fransway reports several such stories in her book

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In meetings, members share how they're working at the &quot;12 steps,&quot;
such as seeking forgiveness of others they have harmed by their
behavior after the rape and relying on the care of God or a higher
power after &quot;admitting&quot; they had become powerless.
Grateful participants say the 12-Step method can help victims heal,
but critics say it might be pointless or even harm some women. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Although the RSA &quot;steps&quot; say rape is not a victim's fault,
participants are invited to list all people &quot;our actions had
harmed as a result of our being raped&quot; and then make amends to
those people. The steps also include taking personal inventory,
&quot;and when we were wrong promptly admit(ting) it,&quot; as well
as &quot;humbly ask(ing) God to remove our shortcomings.&quot;<br>

&quot;stories&quot; while they're still reeling from their own assault.<br>

The 12-Step model can't be fit like a cookie cutter over rape victims'

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed, no
matter what the cause, there is something wrong <i>with us</i>.
If somebody hurts us and we are sore, we are in the wrong also.
But are there no exceptions to this rule? What about
&quot;justifiable&quot; anger? If somebody cheats us, aren't we
entitled to be mad? Can't we be properly angry with self-righteous
folk? For us in A.A. these are dangerous exceptions.
We have found that justified anger ought to be left to those better
qualified to handle it.<br>

<p>

What drivel. We can't be angry? We must always be passive
doormats, no matter what anybody else does to us?
There is something spiritually wrong with us if we are
&quot;disturbed&quot; by thieves, bullies, rapists and murderers hurting us?
Only &quot;normal&quot; people can handle righteous anger and
fight back, and we cannot, because we are just stupid alcoholics,
or stupid wives and children of alcholics, who are
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_feel" target="_blank">not qualified to feel our own feelings</a>?

<p>
Should the abused children of alcoholics confess to having exercised
really poor judgement in their choice of parents? Apparently so. How do
they make amends for that? And how do they make amends for having gotten
beaten up so much? Are they too supposed to apologize to their parents
for having gotten angry about it? Apparently so.
<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
For that matter, am I &quot;axiomatically spiritually wrong&quot; when I get angry

<p>
This induction of guilt in the victims of crimes like
rape, pedophilia or alcoholic child abuse is
not only a very bad mental health practice, it is positively
harmful &#8212; just the opposite of recovery. Far too many girls who were
the victims of rape, especially incestuous rape, feel that it was
somehow all their own fault, and
then here comes a stupid twelve-step cult religion telling
them that it was. Those girls often feel
extremely ashamed of themselves after the rape, and the last
thing they need is a crazy Buchmanite cult telling them that they must
<i>&quot;find their part in it&quot;</i> and perform a fearless moral inventory and
confess all of their wrongs and sins and defects of character and
moral shortcomings....
<p>
<a name="ACOA"> </a>
Adult Children of Alcoholics likewise have massive
inferiority complexes from years of
physical and mental abuse, and then their twelve-step program
encourages them to wallow in guilt
and nit-pick all of their own &quot;defects of character.&quot; 
That is not helpful. In fact, it is so bad that the only thing
it is good for is urging people to commit suicide.

Alice Miller responded to the letter:

&quot;Fortunately, you can eventually see how dangerous, feeble-minded and cruel
it is to demand from survivors of child abuse that they make amends. You feel that
the 12 steps helped you to your recovery but I have the impression that perhaps
you were lucky to meet with some empathic people in your life who could help you.
On the other hand, without this disgusting, hypocritic poisonous ideology you
would have had helped yourself much quicker. Because you ARE smart but you were
never allowed to defend yourself and had to learn very early to protect your parents
instead of protesting against THEIR CRUELTY. The same was repeated in your 12-program,
you were supposed to oversee [overlook] hypocrisy and betrayal and feel grateful
for it instead of opening the eyes and feel the rage where it was absolutely justified.
Your letter shows very clearly how even smart people become stuck in confusion for
years if the &quot;healers&quot; demand from them the same as the parents did from
the child: to stay blind, to forgive, to make amends, not to make troubles. The
fear of the parents, stored up in the body, can make a person obedient and sick
for ever. I hope that you can overcome this fear by seeing though the hypocrisy
of your helpers and TALKING about what you see.&quot;

The book &quot;The 12 Steps for Adult Children&quot; gives us this bad logic:

<h3>Understanding Step Three</h3>
<p>
Imagine the insanity of trying to perform surgery on ourselves. At the first hint of pain
from the scalpel, we would stop. Healing would never happen. It is just as insane to think
that we can manage our own recovery. We must put our lives into the hands of our Higher Power,
who knows the extent of our disease. Our Higher Power alone knows what is needed for healing
and has our best interest at heart.
<p>
In Step Three we decide to turn the scalpel over to God as we understood God. We decide to turn control
of our will and our lives. We have admitted our powerlessness and inability to manage our lives.
We also have come to believe that God can heal us, and now, we decide to turn our will and our lives
over to God's care.

<p>
There are a lot of falsehoods in those paragraphs:
<ol>
<p><li>  <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater" target="_blank"><b>Bait and switch</b>:
It's your &quot;Higher Power&quot; in paragraph one, and then it's their &quot;God&quot; in paragraph two.</a>
That is quite a switcheroo. What if your Higher Power isn't the same thing as their God?

<p><li>  Assumption of disease. Who says that we have a &quot;disease&quot; that needs &quot;surgery&quot;?
We are children of alcoholics, not cancer patients.

<p><li>  Assumption of powerlessness. Who says that we are powerless over our problems?
What a self-defeating attitude.
<p>
In fact, their example of powerlessness is dead wrong. A few years ago, a woman who was
stationed at Antarctica came down with appendicitis. She was stranded, the weather was bad,
 and it was impossible to fly an airplane in and get her. While the doctors talked to her
on the radio and advised her, she successfully performed an appendectomy on herself
because she just had to. She was not powerless over her problem. 
<p>
A correspondent uses a very apropos signature:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You don't realize how strong you can be until it is your only choice.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  == &nbsp; Avogadno
</font>
</blockquote>


<p><li> &#8212; Which leads to the question: What problem?
What is the &quot;disease&quot; that comes from being the grown-up child of an alcoholic?
Like all books in this genre, it begins with a laundry list of questions
like &quot;do you feel insecure?&quot;, &quot;do you try to please people?&quot;,
&quot;do you have feeings of low self-esteem?&quot;, and &quot;are you intimidated
by angry people?&quot;, and that supposedly defines a &quot;disease&quot; that
needs &quot;recovery&quot;.
Then they assume that a dozen cult recruiting and indoctrination tricks
of Dr. Frank Buchman's religion will cure or &quot;treat&quot; that &quot;disease&quot;.

<p><li> What &quot;recovery&quot;? How do you recover from having been born the child of an alcoholic?
Are they talking about PTSD from having been terrorized as a child? That should be treated by
qualified and licensed psychiatrists and counselors, not by some incompetent amateurs who use the
practices of an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties.

<p><li> Who says that we &quot;must put our lives into the hands of our Higher Power&quot;?
<i>Must</i>? What happened to
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#musts" target="_blank">the slogan &quot;There are no <i>musts</i> in The Program, only suggestions&quot;</a>?
That's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#no_musts" target="_blank">another bait-and-switch trick</a>.
<p>
And how is that undefined &quot;Higher Power&quot; going to cure our problem that they claim needs
something like surgery? Do ghosts perform good surgeries?

<p><li>
They say,
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Our Higher Power alone knows what is needed for healing and has our best interest at heart.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Oh really? Only Doorknob Almighty knows? And Doorknob Almighty really cares about us?
<p>
Again, they are pulling a bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#kind_of_God" target="_blank">
First they say that it is any &quot;Higher Power&quot; as
we understand it, and then it's their fake Judea-Christian &quot;God&quot; who
delivers miracles on demand, and who micro-manages the world</a>.
And &quot;He&quot; allegedly cares about us so much that He will manipulate the world
to suit us &#8212; but only if we confess enough &#8212; while He ignores
the sick African children with AIDS, and the starving Ethiopian children.

<p>
The claim that only &quot;Higher Power&quot; knows what is needed
is the standard cult characteristics of
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank">insistence that the cult is <i>the only way</i></a>,
and
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_panacea" target="_blank">only the cult has the panacea</a>.

<p><li>
Notice the assumption that the 12 Steps and God go together. A.A. Step Three says that you must
surrender control of your will and your life to &quot;God as we understood Him&quot;, but the real
instructions are to do the 12-Step program, which is just a bunch of
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's cult practices</a>,
and they are not anything from God as we understand Her.
(See the file <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a> for much
more about that.)

Yep, as soon as you are born, you need to start learning how to
do the 12 Steps and confess your sins, because Daddy drinks too much.
You have the &quot;spiritual disease&quot; of co-dependency because
you were born to the wrong parents. Again, we see
<a href="orange-heresy.html#childhood" target="_blank">the heretical idea of
inherited sin</a> showing its ugly head (well, heretical to
Christians and who-knows who else).
<p>
Note that the third item in that list says that the children will
learn effective ways to cope with their problems, but the last
two items on the list tell us that Al-Anon's
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#moral_inventory" target="_blank">guilt-inducing
Twelve Step cult religion</a> will be the answer to everything.
They aren't really going to teach any &quot;effective ways to cope&quot;.
<p>

The Alateen web site goes on to say,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

How convenient. All of the children will get experienced,
well-indoctrinated adult case managers who will supervise their
brainwashing right from the start.

AA was always thrilling. The families were included in all of the meetings;
 wives and parents (there weren't many alcoholic women then), and the
 children came too. The children were vitally interested in everything that
 went on. They would inquire about all the members and want to know how they
 were. They'd learn the Twelve Steps and really try to live by them. I don't
 think youngsters can be too young to be thrilled by the AA program and be
 helped by it.<br>

The first panel says that the children &quot;don't feel guilty any more&quot;.
At the same time, the cartoon also teaches the children to stop &quot;blaming others&quot;, like their
alcoholic parents, for the fact that their young lives are a living hell,
and to start &quot;looking at themselves&quot;, and to find fault in themselves.
&#8212;To, as A.A. says it, &quot;Find our part in it.&quot;
(That's the

That is, of course, a good example of Orwellian double-think &#8212; you shouldn't feel guilty, but you should blame yourself.

The next panel teaches the children
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial" target="_blank">dishonesty and denial</a>
&#8212; to deny that they are blaming themselves for their own unhappiness
and for their parents' misbehavior, and
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_feel" target="_blank">to deny that practicing
the 12 Steps makes them feel guilty</a>.

Computing clean time likewise becomes ridiculous. Groups
like A.A. and N.A. (Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous)
have a status
system where the more clean and sober time you have, the higher
your status, and the more
respect you get, and the more your words are considered to be
valuable guidance for others
seeking to recover.
It doesn't matter if you are a real asshole,
or
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">a sexual predator who tries to sponsor all of the attractive new women members</a>,
or a mindless fanatic whose only life is going to meetings and parroting slogans,
or
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Lemanski" target="_blank">just plain crazy</a>;
clean time is everything. Clean time is status. Clean time is rank.
<p>
But is a little girl in Survivors of Incest supposed to brag
that it's been 90 days since she
last got raped by her uncle or step-father? And then everybody cheers, and they
give her a coin or a keytag for
her 90 days of abstinence, and tell her to keep up the good work? 
Ummm, no, not quite.

Similarly, Adult Children of Alcoholics and Alateens
cannot abstain from being children of alcoholics;
once you are born one, you're stuck with it for life. So ACOA
literature has a funny new statement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Say what? That is nonsensical psycho-babble. Just go
to ten meetings, and everything will
be magically, irreversibly, fixed at some later date?

<p>
And I'll just &quot;recover&quot;? Recover from what, exactly?
<ul>
<li>
I don't want to recover from having been born (die).
<li>
And I can't recover from having
been born the son of a certain man; not without a massive gene
replacement operation which isn't possible yet.
<li>
Are we talking about child abuse issues, and the psychological
damage caused by growing up in an angry, hateful,
dysfunctional family?
That is not going to be cured by doing the Twelve Steps and
confessing how sinful and defective my character is...
<li>
So exactly how are we supposed to &quot;recover&quot; from having
been born the children of alcoholics?
</ul>

<p>
And:

&quot;Everything in that

<p>
Is the asphalt in the street under my feet part of the

How could it be? And how could my life feeling chaotic perhaps
stop the asphalt from being a part of the &quot;recovery process&quot;?
<p>
Who are these bozos?
What do they do, just sit around and make up that kind of stuff all
day long?
It is real work, and requires real talent,
to write such crazy mind-bending propaganda, and somebody
out there is cranking it out by the ton...
<p>
What if I feel a little nervous about trusting
my future mental health to some unexplained irreversible process
of &quot;recovery&quot; that will be managed by double-talking
religious fanatics who grandly proclaim that <i>everything</i>
is part of the recovery process?
<p>
&quot;Well, that is negative thinking, and it is symptomatic
of your disease,&quot; they will tell you,
&quot;and it impedes your recovery, so don't do it.&quot;
<p>
Darned right it is negative thinking, and I like my negative
thinking. It has kept me from
getting sucked into some very nasty cults, over the years. So
far, it has kept me alive, so I am not
in any big hurry to dump it, and trust my mind to some grinning
strangers who constantly yammer &quot;It's Spiritual, Not Religious&quot; as
they brag about how &quot;Higher Power&quot; is granting their wishes...

But this has to be some of the most outrageous snake oil:
I just ran across a reference to a book on treatment for
<i>Adult Grandchildren of Alcoholics</i>. No joke. I saw an endorsement on
the back of a Hazelden book about how to quit smoking with the twelve steps,
and just had to check it out. It's <i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another
Generation of Co-dependency</i> by Ann W. Smith. Unbelievable.
<p>
It's just like what Andrew Meacham described in his chapter on co-dependency
(in <a href="orange-top10.html#Meacham" target="_blank"><i>Selling Serenity</i></a>):
invent a non-existent
disease, and then charge a fortune to treat it.
Now you can seek &quot;treatment&quot; because Grandma was a
wild fun-loving flapper who loved to party and drink bathtub gin and
dance the Charleston. 
<p>
So just what is co-dependency? Well, we never get a good definition.
It's kind of like the word &quot;smurf&quot;. If you ever watched the Saturday morning
<b><i>Smurf</i></b> cartoons on TV, you know how they used the word &quot;smurf&quot; for everything:
&quot;We're going to smurf us up a smurfing good time.&quot; And another
little blue guy responds, &quot;Smurfy!&quot;
<p>
Well, co-dependency is like that. No matter what ails you, it's probably
caused by co-dependency,
even if you don't even know that a distant ancestor once drank alcohol.
That is not a joke or an exaggeration. The authoress tells us that most
&quot;co-dependent&quot; grandchildren of alcoholics weren't even
told about their alcoholic grandparent, but that the imbibing grandparent
was still supposedly messing up their lives anyway. (Page 44.)

Supposedly, any and all of these things are causes or signs of co-dependency:

Sometimes Smith's characterization and stereotyping of &quot;co-dependents&quot; is absurd:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Betsy ... was the wife of an alcoholic.
She was caught in the cycle of threatening to leave her abusive alcoholic husband,
occasionally doing so but always returning. &nbsp; ...<br>
She was painfully aware that her life was exactly like her mother's had been.
She was an Adult Child, absolutely incapable of change using insight alone.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 116.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such extreme language, such
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_black_white" target="_blank">absolute black-and-white thinking</a>,
<i>&quot;exactly like ... absolutely incapable&quot;</i>.... That is obviously untrue.
It can't be correct.
<font color="blue">
(Besides which, Ms. Smith listed
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_black_white" target="_blank">extreme thinking</a>&quot; as one of the
signs of co-dependency. Is Ann Smith a crazy co-dependent?)
</font>
To live two lives that are exactly alike, those
two women would have had
to have been born in the same year, in the same place,
to the same parents, and had the same experiences,
etc....
They would have to be identical twins.
That's obviously impossible, since one was the mother of the other.
<p>
All that the authoress is doing is shoving descendants of alcoholics into
stereotypes and then declaring that they are all alike because they share one characteristic.
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#one_similarity" target="_blank">
<i>The Fallacy of One Similarity</i></a>.

<p>
In addition, we can argue that no woman is <i>&quot;absolutely incapable of change&quot;</i>
unless she is dead.
<p>
And what is that <i>&quot;using insight alone&quot;</i>
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">qualifier</a>
supposed to mean?
Insight isn't our only skill.
People often change their behavior based on their desires &#8212; the
desire to be something, or the desire to get something, or the desire to avoid
something &#8212; like the desire to avoid pain and death.
People don't just use &quot;insight alone&quot; to decide what to do.
(Word games &#8212; the Steppers just inundate us in a tsunami of word games.)
<p>
Then Ann Smith tells us that 12-Step groups like A.A., Al-Anon, and ACOA
aren't enough &quot;help&quot;, and you also need her version of &quot;therapy&quot; too:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is my belief that self-help alone is not enough for the ACoA/GCoA in
most cases.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 125.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nevertheless, Ms. Smith still requires &quot;active involvement in a 12-Step
<i>recovery program</i>&quot; as part of her treatment program.
<font size="-1">
(Page 101, italics in the original.)
</font>
And she uses 12-Step meetings for &quot;on-going support&quot; during and after her
&quot;therapy&quot;.
<font size="-1">
(Page 107.)
</font>

<p>
Then this authoress even discusses (expensive) <i>inpatient</i> treatment
for the condition of being an &quot;ACoA/GCoA&quot; (Adult Child of
Alcoholics / Grand Child of Alcoholics).
<font size="-1">(See pages 108-114.)</font>
The back cover of the book tells us that the authoress
<font color="#6f008f">
&quot;designed one of the
first programs in the United States to treat ACoAs on an in-patient
basis. This five-day program currently serves as a model for other such
programs evolving across the country.&quot;
</font>
<p>
But she really recommends &quot;long term&quot; 28-day inpatient treatment
for being the child or grandchild of an alcoholic.
One of the advantages: She says that health insurance companies
are more likely to pay for long-term treatment, even when they won't cover
short-term treatment.
<font size="-1">(Page 109.)</font><br>
<font color="blue"><i>
How convenient for the Stepper &quot;counselors&quot; who make a living
by selling this quack medicine.
</i></font>

<p>
Then we learn that the expensive inpatient treatment doesn't exactly work;
it doesn't really fix the problem. In fact, you might end up far worse, really messed up:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Aftercare is more than essential; it is the key to the success of any
inpatient program, and must be emphasized from beginning to end. Without
adequate follow-up, the individual will be left feeling abandoned and
unable to function in the real world.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 113.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So the patients are left addicted to the &quot;treatment&quot; and unable
to function &quot;in the real world&quot; if they don't get their fix?<br>
<font color="blue">
Just where else is there to function, besides in the real world? La-La-Land?
A mental hospital? An insane asylum?
</font>

<p>
And of course the authoress recommends that you continue going to your 12-Step
group (or groups) both before and after treatment. In fact,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;There is no better means to discovery of a Higher Power than within
a 12-Step program.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 125.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
(I wonder what the Pope would say about that...
Or the Southern Baptist Conference...)</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
And again, notice
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives" target="_blank">
the bait-and-switch trick</a>, the sudden change in objectives: The goal
was supposed to be healing, to become mentally and emotionally whole, but Ms. Smith suddenly
changed the goal to &quot;discovery of a Higher Power&quot; &#8212; i.e., the religious conversion
of her patients.
</font>

<p>
For me, the real kicker was this story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Don S., age 47, is an Adult Child who was showing signs of a co-dependent crisis
on the job, with his health and at home. He was progressively becoming
more short-tempered and suffered from chronic headaches which caused him to
miss a great deal of work. When he did work, Don put in 10-to-12-hour days
and looked exhausted. At home, Don was losing interest in his children, and
his relationship with his wife was distant and angry.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Don's denial was such that he was unable to see the reality of his situation
and seek help. Fortunately, his wife, also an ACoA, but in recovery, was able
to see the signs and contacted the Employee Assistance person at his place
of employment. She had tried unsuccessfully before this to convince Don to
go to a counselor with her.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Her only alternative was to watch her husband die emotionally, possibly even
physically, or seek professional help to do a formal intervention. After several
weeks of preparation, and with the assistance of Don's co-workers and another friend,
Don agreed to accept treatment in an inpatient co-dependency program.<br>
</font>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice how nobody seems to have even considered asking an actual medical doctor
or psychiatrist to see what the guy's problem might be.
The authoress just talks about getting the guy to a &quot;counselor&quot;,
even though the guy's life was supposedly in danger.
Apparently, the authoress considers the eight years of medical school
and two or three years of internship that
real doctors go through to be useless and irrelevant.<br>
<font color="blue">
(...Perhaps because few real doctors parrot the co-dependency party line &#8212;
neither the American Medical Association nor the American Psychiatric
Association recognize the existence of any such &quot;spiritual disease&quot;
as co-dependency.)
</font>
<p>
The guy's 12-Stepper ACoA wife just decided that,
since she wasn't &quot;in denial&quot;, she was qualified to 
single-handedly diagnose his problem as &quot;a co-dependency crisis&quot;
and arrange an &quot;intervention&quot; to force him into &quot;inpatient
co-dependency treatment&quot; at company expense.

The authoress of that book isn't a medical doctor or a psychiatrist either, by the way.
The Hazelden book on quitting smoking with the 12 steps lists
her alphabet soup as &quot;M.S., C.A.C.&quot;. (Her own book didn't list any degrees,
but Andrew Meacham tells me that she also has a Ph.D.) So she is a
certified addictions counselor with a Ph.D., not a medical doctor,
but she apparently considers herself qualified
to diagnose a possible severe and dangerous medical or psychiatric problem in <i><b>a clean and sober
non-addict</b></i> as &quot;a co-dependency crisis&quot;.
What a great way to expand your practice, even if it is practicing medicine
without a license.
<p>
Then Ms. Smith warned us about her incompetent competitors:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many therapists are just beginning to work with Adult Children, and may not
even know that a Grandchild needs help. In addition, the services offered are
not always labeled in a manner that tells the client what the primary goal
is, for example, education vs. treatment.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 95.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Speaking of which, Ms. Smith never told us just what constituted her
style of &quot;treatment&quot;, what was done,
or how it worked, or even if it did really work, or how she measured
&quot;success&quot; &#8212; or if she even measured it at all.
We got no such information. Zilch. Nada.
<p>
Ann Smith gave us lots of laundry lists of symptoms or signs of the &quot;spiritual disease
of co-dependency&quot;, but she never told us what her treatment was.
We were left to assume that her brand of inpatient treatment
would somehow work and produce some unspecified positive results, without
any actual evidence at all.
The authoress gave us no numbers at all &#8212; nor any other information &#8212;
when it came to the success rate or the effectiveness of her methods of
treatment.
She didn't even bother to give us a <i>Big-Book</i>-style collection of
alleged success stories.
<p>
Ann Smith only said that her treatment might disrupt your life and leave
you crippled:

Judy, age 29, is a recovering alcoholic who realized after several years of

Judy was attending AA consistently and saw a therapist for individual counseling,

<br>
Then the authoress' schemes to force more patients into her
&quot;co-dependency clinic&quot; become downright frightening.
Ms. Smith advises parents to force their children into her facility:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Should I force my children into treatment for co-dependency if they don't
want it? &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In my experience with children, every child has some resistance.
This does not mean they won't respond to treatment.
Some teenagers, especially scapegoats, may desperately want treatment but be
unwilling to admit it openly.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, pages 158-159.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Why it's just like that old saying about raping women &#8212; when she says
&quot;No&quot;, that just means that she really wants it bad
but is ashamed to admit it. So go ahead and do it to her in spite of her
objections &#8212; she will gratefully thank you for it later.
<p>
<li> Here, we are told that inflicting mental rape on children &#8212;
ignoring their objections &#8212;
forcing them into &quot;co-dependency treatment&quot; against their wishes &#8212;
is really okay, because they actually &quot;desperately want it&quot;.
Shoving 12-Step quackery on defenseless children
will supposedly &quot;help them&quot; &#8212; &quot;they will respond to treatment&quot;.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Respond how? Flip out like how Judy did?</i>
</font>
<p>
<li> And remember that we still have not ever been told just what Ann Smith's &quot;treatment&quot;
of people really is. All we know is that it can push patients into psychotic breakdowns.
</ul>

<p>
Oh, and Ann Smith says that you can also use her &quot;co-dependency treatment&quot; to
brainwash and punish your children, too, and to elicit obedience and compliance
from the little monsters:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Treatment has been used as an &quot;or else&quot; in some cases.
For instance, a runaway teen cannot come home unless she agrees to get treatment.
With young people who are extremely resistant, we need to take advantage of these
special &quot;opportunities&quot; to offer help.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 159.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<ul>
<li> Who says that runaway teens are always at fault, and need &quot;treatment&quot;?<br>
<ul>
<li>
What if the girl was running away from a drunken abusive father or a child-molesting uncle or step-father?<br>
<li>
Shouldn't he be the one who gets locked up in a &quot;treatment facility&quot; and pushed into a
psychotic breakdown?
<li>
Why would teens ever want to return to such a household,
with or without &quot;treatment&quot; as a condition of return?
</ul>
<p>
<li> And I can't help but notice that no matter what the problem is,
Ms. Smith's clinic would make more money.
<p>
<li> The youths are &quot;extremely resistant&quot; to what, exactly?<br>
<ul>
<li> alcoholic abuse?
<li> 12-Step abuse?
<li> rape? incest?
<li> brainwashing?
<li> fascism?
</ul>
<p>
<li>
And what part of the &quot;treatment&quot; program breaks down their resistance?<br>
<p>
<li>
Will that &quot;treatment&quot; push those teens over the edge into a psychotic episode,
like happened to Judy?

<p>
<li> Why is the word &quot;opportunities&quot; in quotation marks like that?<br>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>'...we need to take advantage of these
special &quot;opportunities&quot; to offer help'?</i></font><br>
What is that sentence really supposed to mean, and why do the quotation marks give it
draconian overtones?
</ul>

<p>
Then Ms. Smith reverts to typical Stepper behavior and starts blaming the victim:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
While reviewing the list of 'adult abuses', it is clear that there is no such
thing as a completely helpless victim. Very seldom, as adults, are we totally
without options.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 76.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BECOME A VICTIM WITHOUT ADEQUATE TRAINING AS A CHILD.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
So how is it our fault if we were abused as children and taught to live a
victim's lifestyle?

<p>
And, finally, if you go to your regular doctor or counselor and he or she tells you that
you don't need any treatment for &quot;co-dependency&quot;, Ms. Smith
gives you this advice:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... don't waste your time and/or money trying to convince someone you are
sick enough to be there. A really good therapist, trained in family systems,
will understand what you are saying and will help you to make connections
with the past. Your present unmanageability will be evidence enough that
something is wrong.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, pages 100-101.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul>
<li> If the doctor or counselor says that we aren't sick with 'codependency' and don't need
any quack medicine treatment,
what makes the authoress Ann Smith so sure that we <i>are</i> sick and we <i>really do</i>
need her expensive treatment?
How can she make that diagnosis when she hasn't even seen us &#8212; <i>not ever</i>?

<p>
<li> &quot;Codependency Treatment&quot; will help us make what &quot;connections with
the past&quot;? We aren't treating amnesia here. That is just so much double-talk and nonsensical babbling.
<p>
<li> And what about &quot;Your present unmanageability&quot;?
Who says that our lives are unmanageable, and that we are powerless over our problems?
Only the 12-Stepper crazies.
<p>
<li> And once again, we have a Stepper telling us that a thoroughly-indoctrinated
true-believer 12-Step counselor, sponsor, or &quot;therapist&quot;
who parrots the co-dependency party line
is superior to a real doctor for diagnosing and treating various ailments.
If a real doctor says that we aren't sick from &quot;codependency&quot;, and a Stepper says that
we are, the Stepper wins.

<p>
&quot;We must start recognizing our powerlessness over this disease of Codependence.
<p>
As long as we did not know we had a choice we did not have one.
<p>
If we never knew how to say &quot;no,&quot; then we never really said &quot;yes.&quot;
<p>
We were powerless to do anything any different than we did it. We were
doing the best we knew how with the tools that we had. None of us had
the power to write a different script for our lives. We need to grieve
for the past. For the ways in which we abandoned and abused ourselves.
For the ways we deprived ourselves. We need to own that sadness. But we
also need to stop blaming ourselves for it. It was not our fault!
<p>
We did not have the power to do it any differently.
<p>
As long as we are holding onto the guilt and feeling ashamed, it means
that on some level we think we had the power. We think that if we would
have just done it a little differently, if we had just done it
&quot;right,&quot; if we could have just said the &quot;right' thing,
then we could have controlled it and had it come out the way we wanted.
<p>
The part of you that is telling you that is your disease.&quot;

<p>
So, if the parents aren't responsible for their kids turning to drugs and alcohol,
who or what is to blame?<br>
Burney has some very odd-ball explanations for addiction and &quot;codependency&quot; problems:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I believe that planetary conditions of polarization (of the Energy
Field of Collective Human Intellectual Consciousness / Lower Mind) and
reversity (of the Energy Field of Collective Human Emotional Consciousness)
are what created the Human Condition as we inherited it.
<p>
&quot;The human condition is a symptom! Human nature as we understand
it is a symptom! The human condition is not a result of flaws in human
nature. Both are effects.
<p>
The condition of Codependence - which, as I said could more accurately
be described as outer or external dependence - is the human condition
as we have inherited it!&quot;
</font>
<p>

http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/codependency_recovery/118862/2</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So children use drugs and alcohol because the planet's energy isn't polarized right?
What on Earth has this guy been smoking?

<p>
It's funny how Burney tries to sound scientific here. Soon he will leave such
logic behind and fly off to parts unknown:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Parents do not cause their children to become alcoholics &#8212; or drug addicts.
<p>
Alcoholism / addiction is not caused by environmental factors. It is a
physiological, genetic allergy &#8212; a hereditary predisposition involving
brain chemistry. There is now ample scientific proof, research data, to
support the premise that made Alcoholics Anonymous the first successful
approach to dealing with alcoholism. Alcoholism is a disease. Drug Addiction,
in the great majority of cases, is just a form of alcoholism.
<!---------------------------------------
(It is
possible for someone who was not born with a genetic predisposition to
alcoholism to become physiologically and psychologically addicted to
drugs - in reaction to chronic physical pain for instance, or to a
dysfunctional psychiatric community's pattern of treating the symptoms
of emotional wounding with addictive drugs instead of healing the cause.)

I believe that in a hundred years historians will look back and
pinpoint this milestone as the single most important event in the
twentieth century. This milestone was the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous
in Akron, Ohio, in June of 1935.<br>
<p>
Besides the invaluable gift of sobriety that AA has given to millions
of Alcoholics, it also started a revolution in Spiritual consciousness.<br>
...<br>

In this quote, I make reference to how this consciousness expansion can
be seen in all areas of human endeavor. Likewise, it can be viewed from
a multitude of perspectives. One of those perspectives would be astrological.<br>
...<br>
From an astrological perspective, the Age of Healing and Joy that I talk
about in my book, can be seen as the Age of Aquarius.
<p>
This astrological information that I recently rediscovered is something
that resonated powerfully with me...
<p>
Anyway, in this series of articles I am going to be talking about a
Higher Power of my own understanding. That is, I will be sharing my
Spiritual beliefs and how those beliefs have developed and evolved over
my time in recovery - which will include talking about the influence of
Alcoholics Anonymous and the twelve step process in my personal journey
of growth and awakening.

<a name="Woititz"> </a>
Janet Geringer Woititz, Ed.D., also wrote a book on children of alcoholics,
titled simply <i>&quot;Adult Children of Alcoholics&quot;</i>.
That book reminds me of astrology. One of the big problems with astrology
is that it attempts to define people's personalities and predict their destinies
based on just a few
facts, like time of birth, sun sign, moon sign, rising sign, and the conjunctions
of a few constellations and planets.
Similarly, Woititz believes that she can describe people's personalities
on the basis of only one single fact &#8212; that they are children of alcoholics.

<p>
Woititz devotes the majority of her book to teaching us that all
children of alcoholics are described by this stereotype:
<p>
<ol>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<li> Adult children of alcoholics guess at what normal behavior is.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics have difficulty following a project through from
beginning to end.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics lie when it would be just as easy to tell the truth.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics judge themselves without mercy.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics have difficulty having fun.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics take themselves very seriously.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics have difficulty with intimate relationships.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics over-react to changes over which they have no control.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics constantly seek approval and affirmation.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics usually feel that they are different from other people.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics are super responsible or super irresponsible.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics are extremely loyal, even in the face of evidence that
the loyalty is undeserved.
<li> Adult children of alcoholics are impulsive. They tend to lock themselves into a
course of action without giving serious consideration to alternative behaviors or
possible consequences. This impulsivity leads to confusion, self-loathing and
loss of control over their environment. In addition, they spend an excessive
amount of energy cleaning up the mess.
</font>
</ol>
<font size="-1">
<i>Adult Children of Alcoholics</i>, Janet Geringer Woititz, Ed.D., pages xxvi &amp; xxvii.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Item 11 is another double-bind &#8212; damned if you do, and damned if you don't.
You are a stereotypical ACOA no matter whether you are responsible or irresponsible &#8212;
and whether you are guilty of &quot;super&quot; or extreme behavior is really
just somebody's arbitrary value judgement.
<p>
If you are moderately responsible,
<ul>
<li>
You will appear to be
&quot;super responsible&quot; when compared to derelict homeless alcoholics who are
completely irresponsible.
<li>
You will appear to be &quot;super irresponsible&quot; when compared to
rigid, straight-laced control freaks and compulsively neat people.
</ul>
<p>
You can't win.
<p>
Adults who were terrorized and abused during their childhood may well be
suffering from PTSD &#8212; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder &#8212; but that is a
very different thing than the condition that Janet Woititz is describing.
<p>
It is absurd to declare that all children of alcoholics fit into a
certain stereotype and that they all suffer from the same mental or
&quot;spiritual&quot; problem, and they all misbehave in the same ways,
and that they can all then be &quot;treated&quot; with the same
&quot;spiritual&quot; 12-Step program. But that's what she says:

<h2>For those recovering from addiction to alcohol and/or drugs.<br>
If you keep relapsing or can't put 90 days together...</h2>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Many times folks find themselves unable to maintain sobriety because they are using
the substance in order not to feel the pain of their
<font color="#9F0000">secret</font>.
&quot;You are as sick as your <font color="#9F0000">secrets</font>&quot;
is an expression that makes a lot of sense.
Keeping your <font color="#9F0000">secrets</font> keeps you stuck.
The alcoholic family system is a place of
lots of <font color="#9F0000">secrets</font>.
You may need, if this is your situation, to work first with
<font color="#9F0000">
a professional who understands substance abuse and
understands what it means to be an ACoA</font>.
The purpose of this is to expose your <font color="#9F0000">secret</font> &#8212; if only to you and
your therapist &#8212; and drain some of the pus out. (Some folks are able to use
the fifth step of AA to do this, but it doesn't work for everyone.)<br>

<font color="blue" face="Times,Roman,SanSerif">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>[This is absurd psycho-babble. People become alcoholics or drug addicts
because they feel bad and want to feel good,
and they use alcohol and drugs to try to feel good most all of the time,
not because they have a secret.
This is blatant pseudo-science and quack medicine.
Where does the authoress get this garbage? (Besides from Bill Wilson's cult religion...)
Has there ever been even one valid psychological study that showed that people drink alcohol
to excess and become alcoholics or drug addicts because they have unrevealed
secrets or unconfessed sins? I don't think so.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Note that &quot;a professional who understands what it means to be an ACoA&quot; is really
code language for &quot;a money-taker who believes in (or at least promotes) the myth of 'codependency'
in Adult Children of Alcoholics&quot;.]

<p>
 ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once the <font color="#9F0000">secret</font>, whatever it is, is exposed and the weight of keeping that buried
is no longer present, your next chore is to get clean and sober for a year.
Then it will be time to go on to the next step.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For those recovering from addictions that are not alcohol or drug related,
such as gambling, food, or sex,
it is possible to combine that 12-Step recovery and ACoA recovery.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Any recovery program should work well alongside ACoA recovery. &nbsp;...
<h2>For folks not in recovery from addiction.</h2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Go first to Al-Anon and learn the principles of a 12-Step program and learn how
to work the steps. Not all ACoA support groups follow the steps, but since so many
of their members belong to other 12-Step programs, the principles are followed and
the language is used.
<h2>For everyone</h2>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All folks in ACoA recovery need to learn the Al-Anon principle of detachment regardless
of whether or not they are recovering from an addiction or are living with an addict.

<i>Notice how the 12 Steps and 12-Step meetings &#8212; listing and confessing
your sins, declaring that you are powerless over your problem,
<!--- <i>&quot;Letting Go and Letting God&quot;</i>, -->
and passively waiting for <i>Higher Power</i> to heal you &#8212; are the magic cure-all,

Another aspect of the snake oil routine is the assumption that
the &quot;magic of the Twelve Steps&quot; can solve myriad problems
in a member's life &#8212; even medical ailments.
Sponsors in Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and
Dual Recovery have a bad habit of telling new sponsees to stop
taking their pills &#8212; to
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">stop taking the medications</a> that a
real doctor has prescribed &#8212; and just trust the Twelve Steps to
heal them.
<p>
Those sponsors actually do believe that &quot;spiritual principles&quot;
will fix all of your medical problems. The parallels with
faith healing and the Christian Science religion are immediate
and obvious, and so are the memories of what happened to some of those
other believers &#8212; how they had children dying for the lack of
proper medical treatment.
Well, the 12-Steppers have people dying that way, too.
<p>
And Ms. Ann Smith, whom we just discussed for treating grandchildren of
alcoholics, also warns us not to take medications. In a neat example of
double-talk, she first says that we may need medications, and then she says,
in bold-face type, that we shouldn't take them:
<p>
<a name="substituting"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="#6f008f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some Adult Children and Grandchildren may discover that they are in
need of anti-depressants or other medications before they can fully recover.
Prior to a decision to accept medication, it is wise to have the opinions
of both a psychiatrist and a trusted therapist.
<b>(A word of caution: The use of other mood-altering medications, like
tranquilizers, can be very dangerous to a recovering addict and only
a band-aid on the real problem for a non-addict.)</b><br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Grandchildren of Alcoholics; Another Generation of Co-dependency</i>,
Ann W. Smith, page 110.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
First off, she recommends that we get the opinion of both a psychiatrist and
a therapist before &quot;accepting&quot; medications. (As if
some radical doctor is trying to shove drugs on us, and we don't know if we
should take them...)<br>
What if they disagree? Who has the final say?<br>
What if the real doctor &#8212; the psychiatrist &#8212; says, &quot;Take the pills&quot;
and a fundamentalist anti-medications 12-Step-oriented
&quot;therapist&quot; says &quot;Don't take any medications&quot;? Who wins?
<ul>
<li> If the Stepper gets to veto the psychiatrist, then the Stepper is practicing
medicine without a license, rewriting the prescriptions of a real doctor.
(And practicing medicine without any medical training, either.)
<li> If the psychiatrist gets to out-vote the 12-Step-oriented &quot;therapist&quot;, then why
bother to ask the &quot;therapist&quot; in the first place? Why should the opinion of
a Stepper who has no medical training even be considered?
</ul>

<p><li> The authoress says, <font color="#9F0000">
&quot;tranquilizers can be ... only
a band-aid on the real problem for a non-addict&quot;?</font><br>
Oh really? Just when did the certified addictions counselor Ann Smith become
a medical doctor who is qualified and authorized to prescribe or proscribe
medications for <i>non-addicts</i>? (That is, for normal people.)
That isn't her field, and they aren't her patients. She isn't a doctor or a psychiatrist.
She has no business giving medical advice or treatment to non-addicts.<br>
<font color="blue"><i>
In fact, it is illegal for her to give medical advice or treatment to anyone,
addict or non-addict.
She isn't licensed to practice medicine. She isn't licensed to prescribe medications.
She isn't qualified to advise anyone to take or not take medications.
</i></font>

<p><li> How could she even know what an unnamed <i>non-addict's</i>
&quot;real problem&quot; might be? Anne Smith simply assumes that all &quot;Adult Children
and Grandchildren&quot; suffer from the imaginary disease of &quot;codependency&quot;.<br>
<ol>
<li> That is a dangerous over-generalization.
<li> No real doctor who is even halfways competent would ever make such a broad sweeping
statement about a group of patients about whom he knows absolutely nothing,
and whom he has not even examined.<br>
<li> The authoress cannot possibly know what medical or psychiatric problems some
unnamed non-addicted person might have,
and she cannot possibly know whether he needs to take medications.<br>
<li> Nevertheless, Ms. Smith declares in bold-face type
that medications are
<i><b>&quot;only a band-aid on the real problem for a non-addict&quot;</b></i>,
<font color="blue">
<i>without having a clue about what the &quot;real problem&quot; might be,
or even who the real patient might be</i>.
</font>
</ol>

<p>
<li> Ms. Smith is arrogating the medical doctor's and the psychiatrist's
privileges again, and usurping their authority to prescribe or recommend against
medications.

<p>
<a name="Smith_meds"> </a>
<li> And Ms. Smith is simply parrotting the Steppers' prejudices against medications,
once again:<br>
<ul>
<li> &quot;You won't have 'real sobriety' if you take medications.&quot;
<li> &quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#God_anything" target="_blank">God can do anything</a>.
You don't need medications.&quot;
<li> &quot;If you take medications to treat an addiction,
<a href="orange-big_lie.html#substituting" target="_blank">you are just substituting one drug for another</a>.&quot;
<li> &quot;Medications just treat the surface symptoms. The Twelve Steps will get
at the underlying causes.&quot;
<li> &quot;Doctors who prescribe drugs don't know anything about
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">using spirituality to cure spiritual diseases</a>.&quot;
<li> &quot;Meds quiet the still small voice of God.&quot;
<li> &quot;There is no chemical solution to a spiritual problem.&quot;

groups, because the first thing that they teach you is that you are
powerless over your problem and cannot heal yourself, and

The term &quot;Multiple Personality Disorder&quot; is archaic.
The proper current term is &quot;Dissociative Identity Disorder&quot;.
D.I.D. is a disorder caused by
severe psychological injury usually sustained without intervention in childhood.

With Dissociative Identity Disorder, someone's
ability to solidify their personality was severely interrupted, so the parts that
are normally not fused before age 8, continue to never fuse due to severe, life
threatening trauma. (Thanks to a reader for that.)
