From:  	&quot;Alexandra C.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Alateen" target="_blank">Twelve-Step Snake Oil</a><br>

<p>

I stumbled upon your article recently, and I couldn't help but respectfully
disagree with several statements regarding Alateen.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Alexandra,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
</font>
<p>

I have been a member of Alateen for two years, and I can safely say that
I've hardly been &quot;brainwashed&quot; by the program. In fact, I've found a new
grip on reality.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hmmm... That sounds familiar.
</font>
<p>

The difficulties of living in the teenage world are ever-present, and it is
a typical rite of passage for most people in American society. When paired
with living in an alcoholic home environment, however, teens begin to feel
jaded and hopeless. The principles taught in Alateen &#8212; anonymity, honesty,
acceptance &#8212; are lost on high school campuses. We find a hope in our peers
that we thought had been lost. There's an underlying foundation of unity
that we can't find anywhere else. Cult or not, I wouldn't trade that for the
world.

<p>
<font color="blue">
So your logic is, &quot;It is difficult to be a teenager, so go join a
cult religion&quot;?

</font>
<p>

Beyond that, there seem to be some misconceptions with the program in your
article that I have found present in Alateen propaganda as well as Alateen
criticism. Firstly, though the twelve steps are nearly identical to those in
Alcoholics Anonymous on paper, they are practiced very differently in
Alateen. Specifics can be provided upon your request, but I will abstain
from listing them for the moment.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now this is curious: The very same words on paper, and yet you claim that
&quot;they are practiced differently?&quot;  Well then, you aren't &quot;working the Steps
properly&quot;, are you? I mean, the Steps are specific instructions to
do things. Either you follow those instructions, or you don't.
<p>
 If the Steps can be reinterpreted and changed and reworked at
will, then the Steps don't really mean anything at all.
They are just made-up nonsense.
Everybody gets to change them as he wishes.
</font>
<p>

Secondly, one of the biggest challenges we face in Alateen is the fact that
we are constantly being overshadowed by Al-Anon. There is a typical
misconception that Al-Anon runs Alateen, that the teen meetings are just a
place for the high school kids to &quot;hang out&quot; while their moms bitch about
their husbands in the next room. We are a separate entity. We keep our own
books, we organize our own events, and we write our own literature. Every
year, we, as a group, with little to no influence by adults, organize a
conference, where Alateens from all over Southern California gather. We
meet, we get away for a weekend, and everything is done by our peers.

<p>
<font color="blue">
If I am not mistaken, Alateen is legally owned and controlled by Al-Anon.
Al-Anon does more than &quot;overshadow&quot; Alateen.
 Furthermore, don't all Alateen
functions have adult Al-Anon members supervising and chaperoning them?
<p>
The Alateen web site says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
SPONSORSHIP<br>
Every Alateen group needs an active, adult member of Al-Anon to
serve as sponsor. The sponsor is an active part of the group,
guiding and sharing knowledge of our Twelve Steps and Alateen
Traditions.
</font>
</blockquote>

</font>
<p>

My last issue to address would be the sponsor, or &quot;adult case manager,&quot; as
you put it. Sponsors are NOT facilitators. More than anything, their duty is
to serve us. They drive us all over the state just so we can get to events.
They bring amenities to the meetings, and keep nosy Al-Anons from peeking
their heads in and telling us how to run OUR program. Every sponsor is voted
into our meeting after an appeal. They don't just get to come in and tell us
how to live our lives. I mean, come on. We're teenagers. We're not about to
let some jackass come in and act like they're superior to us. We wouldn't
come back. More often than not, the sponsors stay silent during the entire
meeting, unless their opinion is directly asked. Many sponsors are Alateens
who outgrew the age range, and wanted nothing more than to be back and help
others the way they were helped.

<p>

My collective point is this:

<p>

Both my parents are severe alcoholics. I live every day trying to heal from
the damage that was inflicted ten years ago and yesterday. Before Alateen, I
was utterly miserable; there was nothing to live for. Now, I know that there
are people out there who feel the same way, and even if we're miserable
together, I'm not alone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
If you are getting some feelings of comfort from commiserating with
other children of alcoholics, then good.  If you are practicing the
12 Steps, then not so good. Practicing Frank Buchman's old cult
religion and wallowing in guilt and confessions is not
a cure for having been abused. It is very bad mental health.

</font>
<p>

Alateen may be a &quot;cult&quot; by dictionary definition. Still, I'd rather be
helping someone who doesn't think they'll be able to live through the hand
they've been dealt than lying in the pool of blood, vomit, tears, and
self-pity I wallowed in for five years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I am not unsympathetic to your problem. I was the abused son
 of an alcoholic military sergeant father myself. And I can assure you
 that joining a cult religion
that gets you confessing all of your &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and
&quot;defects of character&quot;, and &quot;finding your part in it&quot;,
 is not an answer to the bad memories, or to
the hopeless feelings when trapped in such a family.
I already had 20 years of a father listing my &quot;defects of character&quot;,
and I don't need any more of that.
</font>
<p>

So, my question to you is this: If Alateen isn't the answer, than what is?

<p>
<font color="blue">
How about some organization or club that does not foist old cult religion
on suffering children?

<p>
How about something that uses Rational Behavioral Therapy or anything else
that is sane and logical?

<p>
How about an organization that doesn't make you think it's okay to
be in a cult?
<p>
If you are really sincerely looking for an alternative to Alateen
(which I seriously doubt), I would ask about support groups
on the forums of things like
SMART, WFS, SOS, Lifering, and the like. There is a list of them
<a href="orange-letters149.html#alt_list" target="newwin40">here</a>.

From:  	VisualThinker<br>
Subject:  	Great Work. Your research is amazing.<br>

<p>
I'm still a 'member' of AA, but I've known for years that nearly every
doctrine is blatantly false. The others are vague enough to have some value for
some people. But NONE of them are true, or apply to everyone.
I needed a structured way to look at myself. I rewrote the first step to
say:

<p>
1. Am I powerless over alcohol? If I'm not powerless over it, why did I
drink the way I did?

<p>
This led me onto a path of self analysis, rather than the mindless
obedience that Wilson tried to get by browbeating people into admitting  'complete
defeat'. I still enjoy some of the meetings, though.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello VisualThinker,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that
you have your head screwed on straight. You sound like you are doing okay.
Congratulations.

<p>
I just went to my first meeting of agnostic AA where I openly criticised
some aspects of AA and was well responded to. Can you give me your thoughts
on this. I am new to recovery programs and want to put myself in the best
situation possible.

<p>
Thanks and thanks for the site.

Hello Al,
<p>
All that I can say there is that your mileage may vary.
I hear different things about different agnostic or atheist groups
of A.A. You might like some.
<p>
You will of course always be a leper in the eyes of the
regular believers in A.A., and they will always want to convert you,
and make you come to your senses and believe &quot;the right things&quot;.
<p>
 The single biggest problem that I have with the agnostic or atheist
 A.A. &quot;program&quot; is that
the 12 Steps are magical solutions where a &quot;Higher Power&quot;
 (God) supposedly
answers your prayers after you confess your sins enough, and grants
you sobriety.  They claim that you cannot do it yourself &#8212; you are
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; &#8212; so you must surrender yourself to God and
hope that God will save you.

<p>
They aren't very clear about how that will work if there is no God who
will save you.
<p>
They mumble things about &quot;G.O.D. == Good Orderly Direction&quot;, but don't
explain how surrendering my will and my life to &quot;Good Orderly Direction&quot;
will make somebody stop drinking.
<p>
And if &quot;G.O.D. == Group Of Drunks&quot;, no way do I want
 a bunch of drunks taking control of my life.

It is not a program, but rather
a technique, and knowledge of how cravings for drink or dope work
in your head.
<p>
That is essentially the same thing as learning to recognize &quot;The
Beast&quot;, as Jack Trimpey calls it. That is what Trimpey is teaching now

about recovery. The first one &#8212; &quot;The Small Book&quot; &#8212; covered all of the
various rational recovery modalities, like SMART, Rational Behavioral
Therapy, and the rest. But then Trimpey declared that was all obsolete,
and just pushed Addictive Voice Recognition Technique as the panacea
in
<a href="orange-top10.html#Trimpey2" target="newwin29">his second book,
&quot;Rational Recovery&quot;</a>.)

I have read through most of your info on AA and found it to be typically
one-sided, as a liberal living off of the taxpayers would be.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Morgs,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Nothing like opening with an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="newwin52"><i>ad hominem</i></a> attack.
So let's get down to facts.
Do you have any study, poll, or survey that shows that disabled veterans
who are &quot;living off of the taxpayers&quot; have &quot;bad&quot; or
&quot;liberal&quot; politics or attitudes?
Or are you just making stuff up?
</font>
<p>
Your notion that AA teaches that it's program is the only way to stop
drinking is hogwash. There are some individuals who may espouse this, but
then again people with alcoholism have a mental illness. If you doubt
that, you ought to write the government (that pays your disability) and
tell them to stop all the misinformation about alcoholism being a disease.

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;A.A. doesn't teach that it is the only way&quot;? You are ignoring a lot of stuff.
<p>
 Bill Wilson engaged in double-talk in the <i>Big Book</i>, and pulled
a bait-and-switch trick when he first claimed that they only knew a little, and had
no monopoly on recovery, and A.A. wasn't the only way to recover,
 and then later changed the story to &quot;A.A. and the 12 Steps are the only way to
avoid death&quot;. See the bait-and-switch tricks of:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2" target="newwin73">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#your_way" target="newwin74">First, they will tell you that you can do it your way.
Then they will tell you that you must do it their way.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#doctors" target="newwin75">First, they will tell you to see a doctor, and say
that &quot;we know only a little&quot;, but then it's &quot;We know more than doctors&quot;,
&quot;We are the experts on addictions&quot;, and &quot;Don't take medications.&quot;</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="newwin76">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;</a>.


<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="newwin77">First, Bill Wilson declared that Alcoholics
Anonymous was only one of many ways to achieve sobriety, then he declared
that it was <i>The Only Way</i>.</a>
</ul>
<p>
And even today, the A.A. propagandists publish articles that make
sweeping statements like:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One way or another Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar Twelve-Step
program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries
from alcohol or drug abuse. In fact, it is widely believed
that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can
put a recovering addict on the road to relapse.<br>

About the government, the NIAAA 
&#8212; specifically, Mark Willenbring, director of treatment and
 recovery research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
which is a division of the National Institutes for Health
&#8212; just declared that A.A. is wrong about alcohol abuse.

<p>
I know many cases of individuals who went to AA and decided that it wasn't
for them. Some got involved in their churches and stayed sober, some I
never heard about again, some died of esophageal hemmorhages or liver
disease, some went to jail.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I have seen similar things. And the point is?
</font>
<p>
What I really find interesting is your absolute loathing for AA. Most
people who write about AA in a negative light run drug and alcohol rehab
centers. I do understand your fear of cults, which may be the reason for
your vicious attacks. The fact is, I know many people from AA who think
for themselves. They do what they want, and have to accept responsibility
for their actions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I am not afraid of cults. Please do not try to put words into my mouth.
I despise cults because I am a child of the sixties, and I've seen
many cults. In the 'sixties, a lot of young
people were seeking something better, something new and spiritual
and enlightened, and a bunch of lying con artists came over here from
India and Korea and Japan and elsewhere, and cheated them.
And more cockroaches came out of the woodwork here in the USA, and
we had a whole bunch of all-American cults too.
And they all mislead and disillusioned a lot of kids.
<p>
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_guru_special" target="newwin13">
When the two &quot;Perfect Master&quot; brothers</a>
 were arguing over who got the title of
&quot;The One and Only Perfect Master&quot;, and sued
each other in a court in India, the judge said something like,
<b>&quot;There is no greater crime in this world than to deceive men
in the name of God. Both of you get out of my courtroom.&quot;</b>
 Yay Judge! I feel the same way too.

<p>
I know that there are some sane people in A.A. who think for themselves,
and I have said so repeatedly. I even call them
&quot;<a href="orange-letters8.html#NRL" target="newwin12">the Newcomer Rescue
League</a>&quot;.

Also look
<a href="orange-letters136.html#NRL" target="newwin11">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters149.html#NRL" target="newwin12">here</a> and

and
<a href="orange-letters45.html#Rescue_League" target="newwin53">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters52.html#Rescue_League" target="newwin54">here</a>.


<p>
That does not change the fact that the overall effect of A.A. is to
make alcoholics worse off.
The actual effects of A.A. involvement are:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin43">raising the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin44">
raising the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin45">raising the death rate</a> of alcoholics.
But how could you expect anything else from practicing a cult religion?

</font>
<p>
The government spends millions (probably billions) of dollars a year on
drug and alcohol addiction treatment with very little success. People
don't quit until they really want to quit. That is the reason for so many
people not getting coins in AA.  Even if AA is 'fooling' a person into
thinking that God is relieving them from the drink problem, it doesn't
matter, if they stay sober and live a better life.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Your whole argument hinges on that last &quot;if&quot;.  Well, A.A. does not work to
get alcoholics sober or keep them sober. So that argument is worthless.
<p>
I agree that alcoholics and addicts don't quit until they want to quit.
And that is one of the big reasons why A.A. does not work.
</font>
<p>
You talk about the leadership of AA in New York. Why don't you go there
and talk to them in person before saying you know so much about it? Scared
to find out something that doesn't fit into your 'cult theory'?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, it would be expensive to go to New York.
If I were to go to New York, what I would really want is to get into
the locked and sealed Alcoholics Anonymous secret historical archives,
and get some more real facts.  I can get misinformation from
the A.A. headquarters here for free,
<a href="orange-letters152.html#AAWS" target="newwin14">like this</a>.
</font>
<p>
What I really find surprising is the fact that I wasted so much time
writing to you, when you're probably a bitter old man who is set in his
ways and can't possibly think with an objective ego. Maybe you can start
doing something positive for society instead of trying to slander people
who are actually trying.

<p>
<font color="blue">
More <i>ad hominem</i> attacks. Don't you have any facts in your toolbox?
<p>
We have talked many times about what really works, and what helps people.

Oh yeah, congratulations on always being correct about everything. I'm
sure that makes you a fun person to be around.

Orange, thanks for all the work you've done to help people.

Here is a site I think should be on your list of useful reading.<br>

Hello Bill,
<p>
Thank you for the compliments and the link. I'll go check it out.

Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

<p>
<font color="blue">
LATER: Okay, now that I've had a chance to go check it out, I see
that it is &quot;Harm reduction, Abstinence, and Moderation Support&quot;.
Okay, yes, there is a place for that.
I'm sure that it can help a lot of people.
<p>
I have to insert a caveat here: &quot;But it's not for me.&quot;
That is, I'm one of those people who just has to totally abstain
from some things, particularly alcohol and tobacco. With those
things, I can't &quot;just have one&quot;.
So moderation isn't for me. Total abstinence is.
More on that
<a href="orange-letters135.html#moderate" target="newwin24">here</a>.
<p>
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="newwin23">
 the famous Rand Corporation study</a> that found that about
half of the alcoholics who quit their self-destructive drinking
did it by total abstinence, but the other half did it by tapering
off into moderate, controlled drinking.
So, apparently, HAMS can help at least half of the alcoholics.
Well, that's good. That is a lot of lives improved.
<p>
So, I'm adding this to my lists:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
Harm reduction, Abstinence, and Moderation Support (HAMS)<br>

Subject:  	What's the point?<br>

<p>
You seem to be putting quite a bit of effort into convincing everyone
that AA doesn't work.

<p>
Bottom line is......what does it matter, and who really cares?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello James,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. It matters a lot to the people who are dying of
alcohol abuse or drug addictions. And to their wives and children and
other loved ones.
</font>
<p>
<a name="it_works"> </a>
Fact is, it does work on some. Not all....just some.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, &quot;IT&quot; does not work. A few people cure themselves,
and A.A. steals the credit. 
But A.A. never accepts the blame for the huge number of failures.
<p>
The overall effect of 12-Step treatment or involvement is
very negative. When it was tested, A.A. 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="newwin43">raised the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="newwin44">
raised the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>,
 and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="newwin45">raised the death rate</a> of alcoholics.
A.A. also <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="newwin46">made later hospitalization more expensive</a>.
And <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards found that having a
doctor talk to the patient and his wife for just one hour, one time</a>
 was just as effective as a whole year of A.A.-based treatment.
</font>
<p>
Additionally, it doesn't cost a dime. It's not like anyone is benefiting
financially or gaining fame and fortune based on the amount of attendance at
meetings.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, 12-Step treatment centers are not free. They charge anything from
$1700 to $40,000 for a 28-day introduction to Frank Buchman's religion.

</font>
<p>
It's free, it's altruistic, and if it doesn't work for anyone they are free
find something else that does.

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. meetings are free, but the rest isn't. And people who are sentenced
to A.A. meetings are not free to go elsewhere.
And when quack medicine, like the 12 Steps,
harms people, that isn't &quot;free&quot;.

</font>
<p>
So, my question again is why are you exerting so much time, energy and
effort into trying to convince everyone AA doesn't work?

<p>
<font color="blue">
To get the truth out.

Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

From:  	&quot;R. J.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	A New World<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
I can't begin to tell you how blown away I am by your site and the Rational.org
website of Jack Trimpey.  It's funny how life flows.

<p>
I'm 60 years old, and I've been to a Chemical Dependency program twice in my life;
once in 1985, when I was 36 years old, and once this year.  Both were 12 Step
Programs and A.A. based.

<p>
When I went into rehab in '85, I was pretty screwed up at the time.  I was working
seasonally as a Class 1 Truck Driver in the Central Valley of California.  I had a
lot of time on my hands during the offseason and soon found some guys into meth.  I
hadn't used it since my younger days in New York, during the Woodstock era, but once
I came across it again in 1980, I really really got into it.

<p>
After 5 years of heavy use, and numerous trips to the emergency room, I came upon
that fateful day, when I got called back to work, and couldn't do it.  There was no
way I could go drive a big rig.  I couldn't function, so I got up one morning and
sat there looking through the yellow pages for help.  My wife saw me, and told me
she knew of a place called The Phoenix Program at St. Joe's Hospital.  Apparently,
she was ready for this day.

<p>
I packed a bag, and went in.  I was elated that I was actually asking for help,
until the head counselor told me, &quot;This is only the beginning.&quot;  That kind of
deflated me, but I went with the flow, did what they wanted me to do, and then went
to a year's worth of aftercare meetings one day a week.

<p>
During my aftercare, I went back to College, got a degree and a Certificate in
Electron Microscopy, and got a good job in the Semiconductor Industry in Silicon
Valley, CA, bought a house, and raised a family.  I never went to one single A.A.
meeting and stayed clean and sober for 12 years.  I literally got on with my life,
and forgot all about drugs and alcohol.  I've never touched street drugs since then,
and only used pain pills when I had a serious hip injury once.

<p>
One day in '97, I stopped on the way home from work (it was a 90 mile ride on
Friday), and had two beers.  I wasn't depressed, sad, didn't have money troubles, I
simply thought it would be ok.  I did that for about 5 years, and then lost my job
in 2002 to outsourcing.  I worked out of the house from then on, and slowly but
surely started drinking until health issues once again caught up to me over the last
couple of years.  So, I decided to go into rehab, get 30 days behind me, and put a
final end to drinking.

<p>
On the day I arrived at rehab in Nov of this year, one of the first lectures I went
to was &quot;Alternate Methods for Recovery&quot;.
He had both of Trimpey's books in the
front of the class.  My roommate took one out, and read it and told me about it.  I
read it after him, it was &quot;The Small Book&quot;.

<p>
It was as if everything I ever thought was found in this little book.  For the last
week I was there, any time we had a book study meeting I would read from The Small
Book.  I knew I was pushing the limit, and that they were getting a little nervous
about what I was doing, but they all respected me, and let me say what I wanted to.
My counselor said I &quot;walked a fine line, but did a very good job of it.&quot;

<p>
After I got out, I read &quot;Rational Recovery&quot; and my same roommate told me about your
site.  Needless to say, this whole thing is amazing to me, and I am grateful for
what you and Trimpey have done.  You opened a new world to me.  Who knows, last time
I quit drugs, I made a new life for myself.  Maybe this time I will too.

<p>
I'm struggling a little with whether or not I'll ever go back to Alumni Meetings at
my last Rehab Center.  I know they will want me to talk, because I always did.  I'm
trying to think what I could say.  I'm not so sure I can walk that fine line
anymore.

<p>
It's still a work in progress, but here's my first attempt.  I'm open to
suggestions:

<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="green" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Hi, my name is Robert.  I graduated from here on Nov 26th 2009.

<p>
Twice in my life I quit smoking, and twice in my life I quit drinking/drugs.  The
first time I quit smoking was in 1979, I lasted 6 years before I started smoking
again.  I started smoking again on the day of the first time I quit drinking/drugs
in 1985.  The first time I quit drinking/drugs I lasted 12 years.  I never even
thought about drugs or alcohol after the first couple of years, let alone use them,
I was too busy going back to school and getting on with my life.

<p>
During that time I quit smoking for the second time (in 1989) and I haven't smoked
since.  It's been 20 years since I last smoked.

<p>
Aside from the time I was here and the time I was at my first Rehab Center, I've
never been to an A.A. Meeting or any 12 Step Meeting of any kind.

<p>
After 12 years of abstinence, I started drinking again, first just a couple of beers
a day, but later heavily.  I made the mistake in '85 of not realizing I had to quit
for life back then, so I left the door open.  Plus, I thought a couple of beers
couldn't hurt me, if I didn't use drugs (which I didn't).  I was wrong.

<p>
In 2009, I quit drinking for the second time in my life.  If my experience with
smoking is any guide, this should be the last time I have to quit drinking, because
I most likely will never drink again.  (AV [Addictive Voice] still hedging &quot;its&quot; bets a little here).

<p>
Now, I certainly wouldn't call myself
 a &quot;smoke-aholic&quot;.  That would be silly,
wouldn't it?  I'm an ex-smoker.
  Logically then, I'm also an ex-drinker/user.
  No?
True, I was an alcoholic, but I quit,
 so now I'm an ex-alcoholic, or better yet, a
person who once had a chemical dependency but no longer does.

<p>
I was never really an addict, even though I almost killed myself on numerous times
taking meth and cocaine.  To be an addict, I would have had to admit that I wanted
to quit, but kept on using anyway.  I never did that.  The first time I really knew
I had to quit, I did.  That makes me an ex-chemical dependent for drugs also.

<p>
I'd like to tell you how I did it.  How I quit, I mean...
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Right about here I'm guessing the crowd would be getting restless.  This is
definitely not your typical drug-a-log.

<p>
Take care for now Agent Orange.  I still have a lot of your site to read, so I'll be
around for awhile.  Meanwhile, I'll be thinking about what to do with my next 12
years.

Hey Orange,

<p>
Here is something to add a little &quot;audio-video commentary&quot; to your &quot;Orange
Papers&quot; site. AAWS has produced a 16:22 minute DVD called &quot;Hope&quot; (I showed it to
my DUI group last night-and a SMART Recovery DVD as well).
AAWS sent it to me for free, and if you can get one, maybe you could put it on your
site with YOUR insightful commentary on what the DVD does NOT reveal about AA (e.g.
that the 12 Steps are NOT &quot;suggestions&quot;, that there is nothing said about needing a
&quot;sponsor&quot; &#8212; who will &quot;know you better then you know you&quot; &#8212; that IS on the DVD!). It
would be a great way to upgrade your site with one of AAWS's OWN produced DVD's, as
you have done with all their other publications!

<p>
Hope things are continuing well,

<p>

Hi again, John,
<p>
Thanks for the note. I shall have to check that out. But alas, putting
it on my site might be a violation of copyright law. I'll have to check
on that.
<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Subject:  	AA Article<br>

<p>
Read your article on AA. I have found it interesting that in my 25 years in the
program that few people I have known have died of alcoholism. This includes those
who still attend meetings and those who do not. Many have drank again and many sober
up from time to time but few have died from alcoholism. I also have asked other
members and they admit that they do not really know many members who have died from
alcoholism. I have seen some suffer for many years but again not great evidence that
points to the death rate I often hear about. I have to think many alcoholics live
into ther sixties and sventies and beyond.
<p>
Thanks Brian

Hello Brian,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I know that a lot of people get over alcohol abuse
and recover their health (including me). 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="newwin14">
 The Harvard Medical School reported</a> that
&quot;at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.&quot;
<p>
But just glancing around at your meeting and seeing few deaths is too
casual of a survey to provide meaningful or reliable data.
It is too small of a sample.
Other people look around at their meetings and see deaths all over the
 place, like 
<a href="orange-letters139.html#suicide" target="newwin81">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters19.html#suicide" target="newwin82">here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters107.html#suicide" target="newwin83">here</a>.

<p>
<a name="masked"> </a>
And then there is the problem of the &quot;official&quot; cause of death.
Often, when a person both drinks heavily and smokes heavily &#8212; which
most alcoholics do &#8212; the tobacco often
kills him before the alcohol does. So the death certificate says something
like &quot;lung cancer&quot; or &quot;heart attack&quot;. But the alcohol was partially
responsible for the chain smoking. Nevertheless, alcohol gets a pass,
and isn't listed as the cause of death.

<p>
And then there is the problem of visibility. People who are staying in
A.A. and keeping themselves sober show up at meetings. People who went back
to drinking don't bother to come to A.A. meetings. So of course you
don't see those deaths.

<p>
Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

Hey Orange,
<p>
First off I would like to say that your site is very detailed, and you are
quite the resourceful fellow.  I personally am unbiased regarding AA (I know
there are flaws, but try to see the good in all things),  but always
appreciated and enjoy delving into the prehistory of things.  I especially
liked all the information on other sub-culture extremist groups, that in all
honesty, I had never even heard of before!
<p>
This brings me to why I emailed you, and I apologize, it doesn't have
anything to do with alcoholism or addiction, and may or may not have
anything in relation to a cult.  Do you have any extensive information on
Free-Masonry?  I am currently kind of fascinated and obsessed with finding
out as much as I can about this organization, simply for the sake of
learning.  I can't find anything online beyond the typical vague analysis.
Anything you can offer is greatly appreciated!

<p>
Warm Regards,<br>
Michael H.
<p>
p.s. Congrats on your 8+ years sober, I am also a recovered alcoholic.  Stay
well Orange!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michael,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. And congratulations on your own recovery too.
<p>
Alas, I know almost nothing about the Free-Masons.
They are just outside of my realm of experience.
The only information I've gotten about them is that one of the co-founders
of A.A., Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith, was a Mason. (<a href="orange-letters136.html#Mason" target="newwin16">Look here</a>.)

Have a good day and a Merry Christmas.

the no 12 steps site</a>

 it was upon finding your site while doing further research for the latest most thorough 4 step that my eyes began to open...
the truth that i might as well have been a moonie

<p>
Hello,

<p>
It doesn't seem that these links in your paper are active.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ruth,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Unfortunately, I have no way of knowing which
links you mean, or which page you are reading, or
 even which web site you are looking at.
It helps immensely if people give exact URLs and quote something so
that it is clear what they are talking about.
</font>
<p>
I have been attending AA on and off for 20 years, I have never heard of the 'Midtown
Group.'
AA isnt a cult. if someone doesnt want to go to AA, they dont have to go!
 If the so-called Midtown Group exists, it's not something AA would endorse , I' sure, and
sounds like they violate the 12 traditions.So, it's a bad group. So what? People can
go to a different group. The program is the steps, which are suggested only.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Those are all standard cult slogans.
You are just minimizing and denying.
<p>
And yes, the Midtown Group most assuredly exists.
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin41">Look here</a>.
And so does the Pacific Group, and the Young People's A.A. in Phoenix,
and the Bainbridge Island Group, and the sexual exploitation society
in Minneapolis... And the one in Miami Beach...
<p>
As far as &quot;violating the 12 Traditions&quot; goes, the Traditions are a joke.
Bill Wilson violated them all of the time.
<a href="orange-traditions" target="newwin05">The 12 Traditions</a>
are just 12 more rules that Bill Wilson made up one day,
and then didn't bother to follow himself.
</font>

<p>
I question your motive for conspiracy here.

<p>
<font color="blue">
?Motive for conspiracy? You mean the A.A. conspiracy to continue
bilking billions of dollars out of sick people by selling them old
cult religion in &quot;12-Step treatment centers&quot;?
</font>
<p>
There doesn't seem to be any. Alcoholics just aren't that organized!
 The program is the 12 steps , which are 'suggested'.
And you know, there are 'bad' therapists, ''bad' ministers, 'bad' teachers, 'bad
doctors, etc,etc, etc, in every group in every walk of life! If one doesn't work,
try another.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is more rationalization, and minimalization and denial.
You are trying the propaganda trick called
 <a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="newwin08">Escape via Relativism</a>
 &#8212; &quot;there is bad everywhere &#8212; your mileage may vary
&#8212; there are bad teachers everywhere.&quot;
<p>
You keep saying that &quot;the 12 Steps are just suggested&quot;.
That is another bait-and-switch trick:
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="newwin07">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

</font>
<p>
At some point, people need to decide for themselves. The 12 steps are to help people
get sober. After that, what they want to do with their life and their soul is
whatever they want to do! And again, getting sober with or without the steps, IS A
CHOICE.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="newwin06">
The 12 Steps are actually cult recruiting and indoctrination tools</a>
 that
were created and popularized by Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman in his
&quot;Oxford Group&quot;.  Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith learned them when
they were members of that cult.
<p>
I agree that people have to decide for themselves when to quit drinking.
And that's why the 12 Steps don't work to make people quit drinking.
</font>
<p>
It just seems you need to find something constructive to do, this seems to be a
waste of time.

<p>
If you have better options to offer,  quit being so negative, and share hope and
other options, not this negative waste of time. Because the underlying message I
hear, is that you are not a happy camper. And if you are 'sober', then why
should people listen, unless they want what you have?

<p>
<font color="blue">
For some lists of hopeful, positive discussions of what really works,
start

By the way, it isn't necessary to have another cure in order to criticize
quack medicine and fraud.
