Dr. Arthur H. Cain wrote
<a href="orange-sepost.html">a criticism of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>
in the nineteen-sixties.  One of his complaints was the arrogant
<i><b>&quot;We Were Chosen By God To Save The World&quot;</b></i>
attitude of some of the A.A. members. He wrote that one example of
this &quot;Chosen People&quot; attitude was a booklet titled
<i>&quot;Around the Clock With A.A.&quot;</i>, published by an
A.A. group in California:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Behind the A.A. fence the original principle that alcoholics must be humble
before God has been turned into the dictum that alcoholics are God's chosen
people. This theme is preached in meetings and through books and pamphlets.
A typical illustration is a booklet titled, &quot;Around the Clock With
A.A.&quot;, published recently by an A.A. group in California. One passage
declares:
<br>
<blockquote>
&quot;God in His wisdom selected this group of men and women
to be the purveyors of His goodness... He went right to the drunkard,
the so-called weakling of the world. Well might He have said to us:
'Unto your weak and feeble hands I have entrusted power beyond estimate.
To you has been given that which has been denied the most learned of your
fellows. Not to scientists or statesmen, not to wives or mothers, not even
to my priests or ministers have I given this gift of helping other alcoholics
which I entrust to you.'&quot;
</blockquote>
Such idolatry causes the believer to see
himself as all-knowing, and turns the missionary into the zealot.
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">
from:
<a href="orange-sepost.html">
Dr. Arthur Cain's article in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i></a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Apparently, Dr. Cain did not realize just how
old or widely-distributed that text was.
Neither did Nan Robertson. In her book
<i>&quot;Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>,
she blamed California groups for the text (pages 146,147).
I found what seems to be the
original source in an A.A. speech given in 1943, in Chicago.
The blue and red highlighting was added by me.

<font size="+2">
<b>Address given by Judge John T.<br>
at the 4th Anniversary of the Chicago Group<br>
October 5, 1943</b><br>
</font>
</center>
<p>


<p align="left">
Tonight marks the fourth anniversary of the founding of the Chicago Group.
In some respects the word &quot;anniversary&quot; is not a satisfactory term
to describe this occasion, for it carries the implication that a goal, a
congratulatory period, a resting point on a journey has been reached. The
program which we have entered upon really has no terminus, for it involves a
continuous striving for improvement. Congratulatory periods tend to
smugness, resting periods to retrogression. This program is not to be
measured in years. It is timeless in every sense except day to day, or even
more precisely, now!
<p>

The history of alcoholic addiction is marked by an unwillingness or
inability to live in the present. For it the morbid past has an unholy
attraction and the uncertain future is filled with vague forebodings. The
hope of the Alcoholic, the real tangible hope of the Alcoholic is in the
present, now is the acceptable time, the past is beyond recall &#8212; the future
is as uncertain as life itself. Only the now is ours.
<p>

As I look about me tonight I see many new faces. Some are here present for
the first time, some who have been here before, and having failed in their
quest of sobriety have returned.&nbsp; To such of you the knowledge that some of
us have been dry since the beginning of this group four years ago may
incline to feelings of strangeness or timidity, and you should feel neither
strange nor timid with us who share a common infirmity. To you but a few
days or a few weeks removed from the misery and remorse of a recent spree,
four years of sobriety may seem an eternity but there is no such thing as
seniority in a timeless program. We, who thru the Grace of God have stayed
dry, are at the most, but twenty-four hours in the vanguard.
<p>

True, we have the advantage of a better understanding of our problem. Day
upon day, day after day, our sobriety has resulted in the formation of new
habits which makes the matter of staying so a less fearsome ordeal than it
was in the beginning. We have had the advantage of association with other
Alcoholics, which has taken us from our old haunts and tended to remove, in a
measure, the occasions of alcoholic suggestion. We older ones in our daily
attempts to live according to the twelve steps of our program have made a
start, at least, toward eradicating disconcerting personality defects.
But, important as all these considerations are, the great step toward our
regeneration was accomplished in that moment when we admitted we were
powerless over alcohol and made a decision to turn our will and lives over
to God, as we understood Him. That act of resignation was an act of the then
present moment, and that Source is as available to you now as it was to us
then.
<p>

The days pass quickly by and time seems unimportant. A little while ago
there was Earl, then there were two and now there are hundreds. This group
is not a result of mass production, this program cannot be sold. It can be
lived and practiced, and it is in the power of example that its first
attraction lies. Each of us presents the unselfish act, or series of acts,
of some other one or ones. We were reached individually by other men like
ourselves,
<a href="#first_unselfish">
who maybe for the first time in their lives had performed an
unselfish act</a>.
<p>

Into our regeneration went no thought of individual profit on the part of
our sponsors, or greed or gain. We are the products of the most refined
charity that men can bestow upon one another. The recognition on the part of
others of our true dignity as men and their willingness to do unto us as
they would have themselves done unto.
<p>

The thing that has happened in the short life of this group is difficult of
comprehension. Jack Alexander, the brilliant author of the Saturday Evening
Post article, says that only through the medium of fiction can it be
adequately depicted. Let us try to appraise it by an imaginary meeting. Let
us assume that four years ago tonight a group of the most learned medical
men in the city of Chicago were gathered together to discuss each of our
alcoholic case histories. As they reviewed them carefully, one by one, all
followed an identical pattern. There were those who for years drank as much
as two quarts of whiskey a day. There were others who drank daily for years
to the point of intoxication, and others who would go months without so much
as a glass of beer. There were those who had voluntarily subjected
themselves repeatedly to numerous so-called &quot;cures&quot;; some who
voluntarily
had themselves committed to psychopathic institutions and insane asylums;
others who had experienced no more severe distress than an agonizing case of
jitters. But all were the same in this respect: that, having started to
drink, we had no self-control that would indicate a stopping point.
<p>

The records before this imaginary group of eminent scientists proved we were
alcoholics, many chronic, some acute! They showed long and unsuccessful
hospitalizations, psychopathic commitments and psychiatric investigations
all without a single successful result. The pronouncement of that august
Tribunal of physicians was that most of the cases were beyond the reach of
science, and that the remainder soon would be. After they had made this
solemn pronouncement, let us assume that a shadowy figure appeared and in an
unearthly voice said: &quot;Notwithstanding the findings of this distinguished
group, in four short years these hundreds of cases that you have pronounced
incurable shall, with the help of God, be made whole.&quot;&nbsp; Around that
room
would be exchanged scornful and doubtful glances and these unbelieving
medical men would say as did Thomas of old: &quot;When we see we shall
believe.&quot;
Yet each of us here present tonight is living proof that the prophecy of the
imaginary voice has been fulfilled; without the drama of the miracle but
just as certainly and just as attributable to the God of whom the imaginary
voice spoke.
<p>

The thing which has happened in the Chicago group, which is happening all
over the country, has come about so gradually and through such material
mediums as to pass unrecognized; even by us, for the moral miracle it really
is.

Instead of suspending the natural law by direct intervention,
<font color="blue">
God in His
wisdom has selected a group of men to be the purveyors of His goodness. In
selecting them through whom to bring about this phenomenon He went not to
the proud, the mighty, the famous or the brilliant. He went to the humble,
to the sick, to the unfortunate &#8212; he went to the drunkard, the so-called
weakling of the world. Well might He have said to us:

<p>
<blockquote>
Into your weak and
feeble hands I have entrusted a Power beyond estimate. To you has been given
that which has been denied the most learned of your fellows. Not to
scientists or statesmen, not to wives or mothers, not even to my priests and
ministers have I given this gift of healing other alcoholics, which I
entrust to you.
</font>
It must be used unselfishly. It carries with it grave
responsibility. No day can be too long, no demands upon your time can be too
urgent, no case too pitiable, no task too hard, no effort too great. It must
be used with Tolerance for I have restricted its application to no race, no
creed and no denomination. Personal criticism you must expect, lack of
appreciation will be common, ridicule will be your lot, your motives will be
misjudged. Success will not always attend your efforts in your work with
other alcoholics. You must be prepared for adversity, for what men call
adversity is the ladder you must use to ascend the rungs toward Spiritual
perfection, and remember in the exercise of this power I shall not exact of
you beyond your capabilities.
<p>

<font color="blue">
You are not selected because of exceptional talents and be careful always
if success attends your efforts, not to ascribe to personal superiority,&nbsp;
that to which you can lay claim only by virtue of My gift. If I had wanted
learned men to accomplish this mission the power would have been entrusted
to the physician and scientist. If I had wanted eloquent men there would
have been many anxious for the assignment, for talk is the easiest used of
all talents with which I have endowed mankind. If I had wanted scholarly men,
the world is filled with better qualified than you who would have been
available. You were selected because you have been the outcasts of the world
and your long experience as a drunkard has made, or should make you humbly
alert to the cries of distress that comes from the lonely hearts of
alcoholics everywhere.
</font>

Keep ever in mind the admission that you made on the
day of your profession into A.A., namely that you are powerless and that it
was only with your willingness to turn your life and will into My keeping,
that relief came to you.

<p>
Think not, that because that you have been dry for one year or two years, or
ten years, that it is the result of your unaided efforts. The help which has
kept you normal will keep you so just as long as you live this program,
<a href="#God_mapped">which I have mapped out for you</a>.
Beware of the pride which comes from
growth, the power of numbers and of invidious comparisons between
yourselves; or of your organization with other organizations whose success
depends upon members power, money and position. These material things are no
part of your creed. The success of material organizations arises out of the
strength of their individual members; the success of yours from a common
helplessness. The power of material organizations comes from the pooling of
joint assets; yours from the union of mutual liabilities. Appeal for
membership in material organizations is based upon a boastful recital of
their accomplishments; yours upon the humble admission of weakness; the
motto of the successful commercial enterprise is: &quot;He profits most who
serves best&quot;; yours: &quot;He serves best who seeks no profit.&quot;&nbsp;
The wealth of
material organizations when they take their inventory is measured by what
they have left; yours when you take moral inventory by what you have given.
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
If these things had been said to us
</font>
there are those upon whom the
injunctions might lie heavy. They might seem austere and difficult commands
but this would only be because we have not realized or have forgotten the
critical nature of our infirmities. Physical disease requires drastic
measures for its cure, in many cases delicate and dangerous surgery. Our
conditions when we came into this group was even more serious than that of
one who goes to a hospital with a gangrenous limb. For, after all, the limit
of his risk is his life while we risked life and in addition things more
precious, sanity, honor, self-respect. We cannot expect to reach a problem
so deep-seated, that science deemed it unsolvable, with as little effort as
is required for the removal of a decayed tooth. It requires the doing of
difficult things including self-discipline and above all unswerving
obedience to a conscience. It is part of God's therapy that man cooperate; a
cooperation requiring high moral courage in the performance of difficult
tasks.
<p>

The aphorism &quot;Man does not live by bread alone&quot; is more than poetry.
It is the utterance of a great philosophical truth.
There is a part of man that is
animal. That part requires that he have bread, and that in quest thereof he
be fitted to take his place in a highly competitive society. He must work,
he must play and he must laugh. But there is another part of man which is
Spiritual and that part can only be properly developed by the exercises and
restraints which conscience dictates. Unless man's Spiritual yearnings are
developed as well as his physical and mental abilities, he is unbalanced and
incomplete and a prey to those capital enemies of all alcoholics: fear,
loneliness, discouragement and futility.
<p>

And so as I draw to the end of these remarks, you must think I have
forgotten Earl and his anniversary. These things I have said to you have
been discussed many times with Earl. Often have I heard him emphasize that
no individual is responsible for this group. Earl was the leaven selected by
wise and benevolent Providence to germinate this group into being. He used
the material entrusted to him with patience, tolerance and understanding but
never for one moment has he felt that this group is his personal
accomplishment, or that he was more important to its well-being than the
most recently arrived alcoholic. The most that he would care to hear me say
about him is that he has tried to be a worthy instrumentality to carry out a
Divine mandate.
<p>

The wise, kindly man may steer us clear of many mistakes but even he makes
some. But in spite of mistakes, in spite of errors, even in the absence of
leadership such as that with which we have been blessed, this work will
continue as long as the alcoholic recognizes his helplessness and decides to
confide his destiny to God. In conclusion I would like to read a letter
which I received this evening from one of the early members of this group
who says about the group and about Earl that which I think, deep in our
hearts, all of us feel:
<p>

&quot;Dear John:
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I told you the other day before I left, the discussion I listened to
briefly in Staley's last Friday infused me with the desire to add my two
cents' worth (in this case sixteen cents, air mail, special delivery) to the
meeting at which the fourth anniversary of the Chicago group will be
observed.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a strong temptation in all of us, I think, to rhapsodize over the
individual net gains in our lives, which we attribute to the blessings that
flow from the application of A.A. principles. These individual net gains,
measured in the recovery of jobs, in the restoration of happy family life,
in the rediscovery of self-respect, are fine in themselves, including as
they do some literal miracles, but I rather think that the Chicago group, of
which it was my happy privilege to be an early member, represents more than
the sum total of all these individual net gains.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the focal point of the innumerable and necessarily unknown processes of
individual spiritual development by the members, the group itself has been
the graceful means for many to catch a fleeting but convincing glimpse of
the Infinite. That in itself makes the group a profound thing.
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I'm afraid, is a little vague. But the fact that the group has been
what it is is not attributable to Providence divorced from the individual,
but to sound, tolerant, and loving minds taking care of the details for
Providence. I think the application to Earl is too obvious to need further
elaboration. If, to save Earl embarrassment, not a word should be uttered
about him Tuesday night, the feeling that I have at a Chicago meeting, a
feeling I know is widely shared, that Christ is in approving attendance
there &#8212; that feeling is eulogy enough.&quot;
</p>

<a name="first_unselfish"> </a>
<i><b>An Unselfish Act:</b></i>
<p>

That was too extreme for me to allow to slip by without comment:
<blockquote>
<b>&quot;We were reached individually by other men like ourselves,
who maybe for the first time in their lives had performed an unselfish act.&quot;</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notice the absolute black-and-white thinking,
and the terrible negative stereotype of <i>&quot;The Alcoholic&quot;</i>:
<p>
<i>Those alcoholics were so bad that they had
never committed one single unselfish act
in their entire lives, before A.A. changed them for the better.</i>
<p>
It is absurd to suggest that there is anyone
alive who has never committed even
one single unselfish act in his whole life.
<br>
<i>What about sharing that candy bar with Rebecca back in the sixth grade?
What about defending Jimmy when the big guys were picking on him in high school?</i>
<br>
Really now.
<p>
What is very interesting is to see that even though Alcoholics Anonymous
had only been in existence in any form &#8212; Oxford Group &quot;Alcoholic
Squadron&quot; or A.A. &#8212; for eight and a half years, and this Chicago
group had only existed for four years, they had already
standardized a lot of the baloney dogma, like the
negative stereotype of <i>The Alcoholic</i>, and
confessing powerlessness and surrendering to the cult,
in addition to the obvious &quot;We Are Special&quot; cliquishness.
And they already had fully-brainwashed members who could rant the standard party line
at length, like this Judge John T. is doing in this speech.
I find it amazing that they could develop and build a cult so fast.
I guess starting with a pre-existing cult religion,
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Buchmanism</a>,
helped to jump-start the process a lot.
<p>
<hr>
<p><br>

<a name="God_mapped"> </a>
<i><b>&quot;<font color="#4f007f">This program, which I have mapped out for you</font>&quot;</b></i>:

<p>
The author, Judge John T., would like us to believe that God said,<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
<b>The help which has kept you normal will keep you so just as long
as you live this program, which I have mapped out for you.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But God didn't say it, and God did not map out the A.A. program for us.
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a> and
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Bill Wilson did</a>.

<p><br>
Likewise, Judge John T. finished up the &quot;speech from God&quot; by saying,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If these things had been said to us there are those upon whom the
injunctions might lie heavy.&quot;<br>
</font>

Then he went on and on, talking about how A.A.s would have to live if God had said it.
<p>
But God didn't say it.

<p>
Judge John T. was using the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions">Sly Suggestions</a>, a couple of times there.
