Subject:  	Interventions<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,
<p>
Thank you for your efforts to educate people about the reality of 12 step programs.

<p>
I would be interested in seeing more information presented about interventions.
Most of them are done by steppers in conjunction with an AA &quot;intervention
specialist&quot; in which the guest of honor is sent to an AA dominated institution.

<p>
There seems to be a widely held misconception that interventions have some
sort of legal sanction that compels the person targeted to stay and cooperate. In
reality they are free to just walk away and avoid the humiliation that goes along
with interventions.

<p>
The presence of a &quot;specialist&quot; seems to imply some sort of medical and/or legal
authority of the proceedings even though there is none at all.

<p>
I recently forewarned a person of a pending intervention and he decided not to
attend. After he was cut adrift by &quot;friends&quot;  I provided him a place to stay while
he got back on his feet. He is now sober and using the SMART approach to remain
abstinent.  I caught some hell for undermining his intervention and was told that I
was &quot;enabling&quot;  him...blah, blah, blah....  It was even implied that I had broken
some law by telling him about the planned surprise party.

<p>
None of those ersatz friends give him any credit for remaining dry and predictably
say he is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot;  My response is that the term dry drunk is an oxymoron and
that abstinence is sobriety.

<p>
The intervention specialist involved is livid that my friend did not show up. My
guess is that he missed out on a referral fee (bounty) from the recovery center to
which his victim was to be sent.

<p>
I would like to suggest a page dedicated to debunking the concept of interventions
and to make it widely known that people are free to not cooperate, that they can
turn around and leave with impunity and that further it is illegal for a
&quot;specialist&quot; to even imply that a person must stay and face intervention.  I feel
that shows like &quot;Intervention&quot; give the impression that interventions once called
have the legal authority of a court complete with a judge who wields legal power.
The truth is that interventions carry no more authority that the average surprise
party.

<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Ron L.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ron,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I couldn't agree with you more. I regard
&quot;interventions&quot; as a criminal activity, a conspiracy where
a bunch of people conspire to overwhelm and 
pressure and strong-arm some sick person
into signing a contract that obligates him to pay
many thousands of dollars for kidnapping, false imprisonment,
quack medicine, mental abuse, and cult religion indoctrination.
That is more than one felony. (Why don't people sue for that? Besides the
fact that most victims are too poor to afford a lawyer.)
<p>
I agree that I should do a page on interventions.
One more item for the list of things to do. Do any readers have horror
stories about interventions?

<p>
Oh, by the way, congratulations on saving your friend from the
intervention. And I'm glad to hear that he is in
SMART. That just tickles me. Both of those things were good choices.
I'm glad to hear that he is doing well.

<p>
Have a good day.

Jeff Jay wrote a book that was published by
the Hazelden Foundation, on how to do &quot;interventions&quot;,
<i>Love First</i>.
Interventions are basically the tactic of confronting someone with
a gang of family, friends, and strangers, including the strong-arm goons
of an &quot;escort service&quot;,
who all demand that he go to a residential
treatment facility where he will pay a fortune to have
cult religion preached at him for a month. Hazelden, for
example, charges $15,000
for a 28-day stay. No wonder they published Jay's book.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
[UPDATE: that number is 15 years old. It is more in the neighborhood of $40,000 now.]
</font>
<p>
I found that book to be a disgusting collection of mind games
designed to overwhelm someone and pressure them into agreeing to
go with the &quot;interventionists&quot; or &quot;escort service&quot;.
<p>

What was particularly revealing was what Jay had to say about
those alcoholics or addicts who wouldn't play along.
Throughout the book, Jay repeatedly chanted the standard A.A.
dogma about how
alcoholics are powerless over alcohol, and it's a disease,
and the alcoholic has no control over it:<br>

&quot;We now know that this is a disease and willpower doesn't work.&quot;
(Page 230.)<br>

Step One: &quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212; that our
lives had become unmanageable.&quot; (Page 247.)
<p>

And then, about the
alcoholic who refused to &quot;voluntarily choose&quot; treatment
in an expensive residential treatment center like Hazelden,
Jeff Jay wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If the alcoholic refuses treatment, read your bottom lines [ultimatums].
Remember, your bottom line is a way of saying, &quot;I will not
support this disease.&quot; It is a way to take care of yourself
when addiction continues to attack your family. You are not
punishing the alcoholic or addict. The alcoholic brings the
consequences upon himself by choosing addiction over recovery.
He can avoid consequences in one of two ways: (1) choosing recovery
or (2) convincing people to enable his addiction again.
If people stop supporting the addiction, the alcoholic who refuses
treatment is likely to choose recovery in the weeks or months
following the intervention.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><i>Love First</i>, Jeff Jay and Debra Jay, page 134.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Choice, choose, choose, choose. So much for how it's a disease and the
alcoholics have no control over it, and only God can stop
the disease.
<p>
So much for the A.A. dogma that alcoholics are
&quot;<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">powerless</a>&quot; over
alcohol.
<p>
Someone who can make a choice has power and control.

I don't know if you ever watch the NBC sitcom &quot;The Office&quot; (it's scary how
much that show reflects my work-life!), but if you missed last night's
episode, be sure to check it out!  I know there's a couple of websites that
allow you to watch it online for free but it might take a week or two for a
new one to show up.

<p>
After getting drunk and setting her hair on fire at the office holiday
party, Meredith is cornered into an intervention by Michael, who after an
utter failure to get the rest of the office to support him, tries to
physically drag her into a rehab center.

<p>
Screamingly funny with what I took away as some strong underlying messages

Hello Dennis,

I managed to see it. The local NBC affiliate reran it at an odd hour a week later. That was delicious satire.
I hope we see more of that.
<p>
And perhaps the rest of the world can see it on one of the rerun web sites that you mentioned, or catch it on YouTube.

<p>
(Which brings up the question of why
<a href="orange-letters103.html#qwest" target="_blank">NBC-Universal is being so anal</a> about people downloading reruns. Seems like they
need all of the help they can get to have more people watch their shows. They have so few good ones any more...
and not much of an audience share either. Oh dear, am I being catty?)

Hi Orange,
<p>
Have you seen the series on CBS Paramount TV called &quot;The
Cleaner&quot;? It is about an ex-addict; supposedly a true story.
This guy
claims to have &quot;saved&quot; hundreds of addicts through illegal, extreme
interventions. He is not licensed or certified. He claims to have a
calling from God. He is of course involved in 12 step meetings. This is a
perfect example of the self-ordained gurus one finds in 12 step
meetings, really sick.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sherwood,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. No, I haven't seen it.
Funny that Paramount feels like glorifying a criminal.
And a self-proclaimed &quot;missionary from God&quot; passing himself off as an
expert on recovery (without any training or education)
is simply surreal. Although that is also exactly what
Bill Wilson did. And Mr. Wilson also claimed to have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">a lot of fantastic successes</a>,
based on no valid evidence.

<p>
Most of that extreme &quot;intervention&quot; and &quot;deprogramming&quot;
stuff stopped back in the eighties when
the &quot;deprogrammers&quot; started going to prison for kidnapping and false
imprisonment, and also got sued for it, plus for torture and abuse.
Look at
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Miller_Newton" target="_blank">Rev. Miller Newton</a> and
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Talbott" target="_blank">Dr. G. Douglas Talbott</a>
for previous examples of &quot;tough-love&quot; torture programs.

<p>
There are a few notes on &quot;deprogramming&quot;  and &quot;confrontational therapy&quot;

<p>
Good day, Orange.  I hope this message finds you well.

<p>
I was browsing through your letters and saw that you'd asked about
Intervention, the A&amp;E television show.  Episodes are available on their
website.  I saw my first few episodes last week in an idle moment, and
did not find the show to be entertaining or educational in the least,
but I do enjoy real-life drama, so I was riveted to the &quot;what will
happen after the intervention&quot; (the results).  Unfortunately, what was
true was that most if not all of the people had some sort of relapse,
which happens (I believe) when we're forced into doing something that
we're not completely ready to do.

Well,
I'm pleased to report that I'm &quot;a-fixing to get ready&quot; to quit.  Again.
I'll go re-read the &quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">addition monster</a>&quot; piece to get my mind ready for
this attempt, and will also go to the American Cancer Society for more
tools.

<p>
As always, thank you for your service to the community.  Although I'm
entrenched in Alcoholics Anonymous for the &quot;Unity, Service and
Recovery&quot;, I fully applaud your reasoning and if you save even one life
besides your own for someone who would otherwise die as a result of AA
programming, you've done a great thing.  Your writings won't keep me
from AA, but they will help me keep an open mind to the folks like you
and Bufe who see AA for what it is, a cultish, passive-aggressive
organization where the groups with charismatic leaders run the
followers' lives.  I see the practical value in helping others, and so
far, the 12 Steps have worked for me, where religion (Christianity) did
not.  I tried to &quot;cut down&quot; and control my drinking at many junctures
unsuccessfully, so complete abstinence with the help of the fellowship
of AA was the solution that worked for me.  Your mileage may vary.
(I've always been a very staunch advocate of &quot;AA is not for everyone &#8212; 
If you have another solution that works for you, by all means, use it&quot;)

<p>
I feel some sympathy for those AA'ers who cannot keep an open mind
toward your writings and insist on debating with you on the virtues of
the Program.  (The book Alcoholics Anonymous has these quotes, &quot;And we
have ceased fighting anything or anyone-even alcohol&quot;, and &quot;Be quick to
see where religious people are right&quot; (that could easily be expanded to
be other people))

<p>
Anyway, enough rambling &#8212; have a great life, and thanks again.

Hello again Eric,
<p>
Thanks for the input, and thanks for the thanks,
and I hope you are doing well. Especially, hang in
there and kick the nicotine addiction. It's really worth it. Never mind vague
way-in-the-future threats like lung cancer &#8212; the improvement in the
quality of day-to-day life now is fantastic. Instead of laying around the
house sick and tired all of the time, I'm always going out and about,
which is how I end up spending so much time down at the river with the
geese, as well as doing a lot of other things that I never used to do.
Now, I have so much energy that I just can't stand to be cooped up indoors
all day long. I can't just sit still or lay around all day long, or
it feels like I haven't lived the day.
I have to get out and go do things.
That is like a day and night contrast from my previous existence.
(I won't even call it my previous &quot;life&quot;.) For me, just the improvement
in quality of life makes it so worth it that I would never consider going
back to smoking now.  Why return to Hell once you have escaped?

<p>
Good fortune. I won't say &quot;Good luck&quot;, because it isn't luck.
<p>
And have a good day.

<p>
<a name="no_meds"> </a>
Painfully long story short, I have major depression with psychotic features and
social phobia. After two years in AA, I became horribly depressed for about six
months. I couldn't do anything, including bathing. I had one acquaintance who
dragged me to meetings. Once again, I had done something wrong. &quot;If you were closer
to God, you wouldn't feel this way.&quot; I finally went to a shrink, and he wanted to
put me on medication. I told my &quot;friend&quot; this, and he took me out to eat after a
meeting, with four other people, and they did an intervention. &quot;We'd really hate to
see you get drunk. You shouldn't take medicine, you won't be sober anymore, and
you'll drink very soon.&quot; Never mind that I hadn't brushed my teeth or hair in weeks.
So, I went to another meeting the next day, and heard my new sponsor speak. He
challenged all (or so I thought) of the dogma, and made me feel safe. I asked him to
sponsor me after the meeting. He said yes, and a new chapter started.

Hi Toni,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer. I didn't realize that this letter was
more important than usual.
<p>
My initial reaction about a forced intervention is DON'T. The reasons are many:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Who could you use as an interventionist or &quot;exit counselor&quot;?
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Ted_Patrick" target="_blank">Ted Patrick</a>
(who liked to call himself &quot;Black Lightning&quot;)
was sent to prison for kidnapping, false imprisonment and cruelty.
There are few or no competent, honest, exit counselors who will participate
in a forced intervention.

<p>
<li> What gives you the right to force your religious beliefs on your other family
members?<br>
Now I'm sure that you think that question unfair, because your nutty true-believer relatives
are trying their best to shove their beliefs on other people, right?
But it cuts both ways.
<p>
<li> And you say that your goal is to &quot;break up part of your family&quot;.
What does that mean, really?

<p>
<li> You say that you will have the law backing you up. 
That is vague. Ordinarily, the courts do not get involved in religious disputes
and force one family member's beliefs on another.
The courts don't want to touch that. We theoretically at least have freedom of
religion in this country.
Even Tom Cruise is allowed to walk
the streets and praise Scientology and rave about bad psychiatrists and tell
mentally-ill people not to take their medications.
<p>
If it's a matter of child abuse, then it is a given that the child should
be removed from the bad environment and custody given to someone better.
But that is not an &quot;intervention&quot; &#8212; that's just rescuing a child.
And that will be legally done by child welfare, with the help of police, not
by some relatives and an ex-cop.

<p>
<li>
Another reason for not doing an intervention is because they often fail, and even do
lots of damage.
(After abusive deprogramming, one girl just sat in her bedroom and stared out of the window
for a year.)
How do you plan to break the will of your family member and change his or her
mind? What methods of torture will be used?
<p>
Do you really imagine that just having some &quot;counselor&quot; talk
to your relatives for a day or two will make them suddenly convert to
your religious beliefs and quit being so crazy?
<p>
And that's what we are really talking about here. You consider the beliefs of
your other
family members to be crazy and unrealistic. They probably are.
(People who do exorcisms are a pretty nutty, whacked-out, scary bunch.)
Still, it really is
a matter of somebody deciding that &quot;My beliefs are better and saner than his beliefs, so he
should change his mind and start to think my way.&quot;
The laws of the U.S.A. say that you can't do that by force.
We have freedom of religion even for the crazy religions.

<p>
<li>
Lastly, what we learned from our collective experience with the cults
of the sixties and seventies is that most of
the cult members eventually &quot;come out of it&quot; and quit the cult all on their own.
The few who don't quit will probably be lifers that you won't be able to save or convert anyway.
</ol>
<p>
Now is there anything that can be done?
I hope so. But it's tough. Crazy true believers in a cult religion really like their
crazy beliefs. They have an intense desire to continue to believe for a variety
of reasons.

You should check out Steven Hassan's book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank"><i>Releasing the Bonds:

which gives a lot of advice about how to get loved ones out of a cult.
<p>
Here are some places in previous letters where we discussed Hassan's ideas for
how to get people out of cults:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Don't give up</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan2" target="_blank">Use indirect criticism of the cult</a>

</ol>

<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#bad_sponsor" target="_blank">Trying to get a young man to leave the cult</a>
</ul>

<p>
Again, if you are seeing a situation where children or any other minors are being
abused or mistreated by a cult religion, then you have every right and even the duty
to do something and rescue that child. Contact the local Child Welfare Agency or Human
Services Department or whatever it is called in your state.
<p>
But if it's just some family members who are crazy as a loon and going off the deep
end with a cult religion, well, legally, they have that right.
You can try to talk sense to them, but you don't have the right to make them change
religions.

<p>

Oh well, have a good day anyway, and good luck.

[2nd letter from Toni:]
<p> 
Date:  	Fri, May 19, 2006 12:10<br>
From:  	&quot;Toni B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Re: We have a cult problem ourselves<br>

<p> 
Thank you so much for responding. I wanted to clarify a few things
though. We weren't going to kidnap anyone, of course. We found out that
I can still press charges of my own child abuse that happened to me. The
exorcisms would go for days sometimes, until I admitted I had demons and
asked God to forgive. I know it's hard to believe this is abuse, but it
went on for about 2 years.
<p>
After me came so many others, and it still
goes on. You have no idea how much mental damage it causes. They take
every thing you do and make it evil, quoting even from the Bible. We
were going to use the law in that they have a choice: counseling or
jail.
<p>
Please tell me with this updated version of a intervention some
advice. I was thinking along the lines of meeting with lawyers and the
preacher of the real church we used to go to as a family, and all of us
kids. It just hurts watching them and worrying about who they hurt next.
<p>
They have another child living with them now, and as usual they train
a lot of kids with their horse ranch. Some of the kids in the past
actually formed a support group online for a while. They don't seem to
know they are hurting others and themselves, that they're predators not
preachers.
<p>
I just want to help them somehow. It's hard to walk away,
like with any family member who's messed up. Please write back and tell
me your honest opinion, I hope it's more clear what I'm trying to do.
<p>
Toni

<font color="blue">
Hi again Toni,
<p>
Ah, okay. In this letter, things are sounding a lot better. I'm really glad that you weren't
thinking of a forceful &quot;intervention&quot;. That's what Steppers do occasionally,
and I'm against it.
And it is of course what the anti-cult people used to do &#8212; kidnapping and deprogramming &#8212;
and I think they did more harm than good.
<p>
As far as pursuing the child abuse charges, that sounds like a very good approach.
Really, it's the only thing that you have.
<p>
And I do believe you. In my years of studying cults for this web site, I've
read some pretty awful stuff,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#JeanneMills" target="_blank">even worse stuff</a>.
It boggles the mind, the depths to which some people can sink.
<p>
Perhaps you have read the
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">Children's Gulags</a>
web page. It also describes some abusive camps where children supposedly go sailing
and horse-back riding.

<p>
You say, &quot;it still goes on.&quot;<br>
That alone is enough for me. If they are still doing that to other children now, then
throw their asses in jail.
<p>
I don't have any faith in &quot;counseling&quot;. All too often,
it's just talk, and nothing changes.<br>
(Now in all fairness to counselors, I think they can help borderline
or moderately normal people who just have some simpler problems that they need
to work through, but
counselors aren't going to change vicious psychotics with just some pleasant chats.
It's just like how repeat sexual predators are not reformed by &quot;treatment&quot;.)

<p>
In general, I feel very pessimistic about your chances for any kind of
an amicable settlement.
Those nutcases believe that what they are doing is right, and almost nothing will
change that.
<p>
What you are actually trying to do is undermine their entire world-view,
their idea of reality.
They actually think that they live in a grim fairy-tale world of
demons and devils, and they see themselves as knights in shining armor,
fighting for God and Truth.
They imagine that their lives are grand epic moral melodramas, where they are heroes
bravely battling against the Dark Forces.<br>
(And I imagine that they suppress any recognition of the sadistic side of their actions.
They probably won't even honestly admit to themselves that they enjoy beating and tormenting
devils out of children.)

<p>
They will not give up that heroic image of themselves and accept the
image of &quot;child abuser&quot;.
They will probably insist that they are right until the day that they die.
<p>
The only thing you can do now is stop them from hurting any more children.
<p>
Do it. Do it by any means that you have at your disposal.
Shut them down. Put an end to it.
And filing charges for child abuse is the sharpest sword in your armory.
<p>
It's a shame that your online support group went offline.
But there are others. Some of the non-religious children's boot camps were
just as bad, and there are groups for them.
<p>
You might want to check these out, and see if you find some kindred spirits there:

I'm sure that there are a zillion more support groups and chat groups. I just haven't
compiled a good list yet.

Oh, and just for giggles and grins, look at these crazy religious fanatics picketing
the funerals of soldiers who were killed recently in Iraq:

Those religious cult wackos are really something else...
<p>
Alas, I don't think that just counseling will change them. That is pretty self-evident.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
