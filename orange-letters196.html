From:  	&quot;Nathan F.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	amen brotha!<br>

<p>
Recently read the page about AA &#8212; right on!

<p>
I went to one AA meeting, got a sponsor, and it was just freaking weird.  It is
a cult.

<p>
I drank daily for years, tapered off and eventually quit on my own for three
months.  I dealt with it by running like a beast &#8212; 3 miles daily at least.  I
had one crazy weekend and a friend convinced me that I needed a sponsor and
meetings.

<p>
The first thing I noticed was after the meeting, EVERYONE was outside smoking
cigs.  Its like, WTF??? You know that shit will kill you too!!  My sponsor
smoked, told me he was on anti depressants.  I'm thinking, wow this guy
absolutely feels helpless and AA is encouraging that.  I know this because I was
on antidepressants at one point.  I told him that I quit because I made my
health a priority &#8212; to which he replied, &quot;I don't care about your running, are
you sober?&quot;

<p>
Now at this point, I wanted to scream.  Heres a guy thats hooked on cigs and
runs to the doc when he feels depressed.  He, and AA have it all wrong.  Your
health should always, always, always, always be a #1 priority.  I firmly believe
that the optimal amount of alcohol for ANYONE is zero.  Its the same with all
the sugary sodas us Americans chug.  All that shit is bad for you.  That is why
I quit drinking, and how I have kept with it.  Because I care about my
independence, my free will, and my mental and physical health.

<p>
I read their book too, so pathetic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Nathan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. 
Congratulations on your sobriety, and taking care of yourself. And yes, you've got it.
Health really is Number One.
<p>
I quit smoking at the same time as I quit drinking because I decided to actually really live and get healthy,
and I knew that half-measures weren't going to make it.
(The A.A. <i>Big Book</i> actually says, &quot;Half measures availed us nothing.&quot; page 59.)
So why quit drinking only to smoke yourself to death? What's the point?

<p>
And you are certainly right about those sodas. Now they are all full of High Fructose Corn Syrup,
which is one of the most fattening forms of sugar that there is,
and the American people have turned into such waddling lard-asses that they look like they are
ready for the Cannamits to come and harvest them. (RE: very old <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode from the
late 'fifties or early 'sixties, where some tall aliens farmed people for a food supply.) 
<p>
Have a good day now. And I think you will.

From:  	&quot;Steve S.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	my family experience<br>

<p>
Thanks for your site.  I've just skimmed it, planning to read it in detail soon.  My
wife had a bad alcohol problem.  In the end, she tried to kill herself, was put in
the hospital and then into a treament program for three months (the longer program
because she's a nurse and the state requires longer for health care pros).

<p>
During the three-month in-patient, my wife and others from the treatment center went
to AA meetings every night.  Now home two weeks, she's really committed to the
program.  And for what it's worth, she does behave differently.  She used to get
angry over just about anything, but so far she's been calm and pleasant.

<p>
However, she tells me she no longer loves me; not in an angry, but rather a matter
of fact way.  She's practicing what she calls &quot;rigourous honesty,&quot; and she doesn't
want to lead me on.  If I'm being &quot;rigorously honest&quot; I can't say that I've loved
her for the past year or so, when she's been, for the most part, a drunken shrew,
but I hung in as long as I could for the kids (although I did consult an attorney
right before she tried to kill herself and went to treatment).

<p>
When I would go and meet with her and the family counselor at the treatment center,
we would try to work on our relationship.  And even though she's been abusive to me
in the past, I've been willing to work on it.  However, she says that right now, she
doesn't want to work on it.  She's staying in a seperate room in the basement.

<p>
When it was just me and the kids this summer, I was pretty happy. I told her that if
she doesn't even want to work on our relationship, we probably don't need to stay
together.  She seems to be totally confused.  Anyway, after reading your website,
I'm concluding that things are probably not going to get much better.  I'm going to
read it in more detail when I have time.  I want to find out if there are statistics
to prove the 12 step doesn't work.  I saw you mention somewhere that only 5% of 12
steppers make it, but I didn't see statistical proof of that.

<p>
PS: I should add that, during the summer in treatment, when my wife wanted me to
work on our relationship etc, she wanted me to go to Alanon.  But that never really
appealed to me.  I'm a happy person.  My wife is miserable, not me.  And my
happiness is not centered on or depedent on her.  So I don't really want to go hear
a bunch of people obsessing on their alcoholic family member.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Steve,
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. To answer your last question first, all of the
statistics about the A.A. success rate are in the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
<p>
The two biggest points in the file are that:
<ol>
<li> People who go it alone and quit all on their own get about a 5% success rate.
<li> People who go to A.A. get about a 5% success rate.
</ol>
A.A. does not improve the situation at all. A.A. just takes the credit for the people who were going
to quit anyway, while disavowing any responsibility for the ones who don't quit.

<p>
And then, the psychological damage from the 12 Step organizations is a big problem.
They will break up your family. Your wife is already being taught to insist that
you must join the cult too, or else the marriage is over.

<p>
Now I cannot predict what will happen with your marriage. But I can tell you that A.A. and Al-Anon
will not help. More on Al-Anon

<p>
Hello Agent Orange
<p>
I noticed that
<a href="orange-rroot750.html#links" target="_blank">the initiatives of change people</a>
AKA modern day Buchmanites,
in typical Buchmanite fashion are claiming in their website(s) that they
are affiliated with the United Nations (which we both know to be BS)
but if you could and would please de bunk this claim it would be awesome
since I have friends in Europe who have given them money under the mistaken
impression that they are an outgrowth arm of the UN.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Leon,
<p>
Thank you for the tip. I didn't know that the Buchmanites are now claiming to have a connection to the
United Nations. It does not surprise me though. I mean, after somebody claims that he has
a hotline straight to God, claiming to have a line to the United Nations is pretty trivial.
And, historically, they have shown that they will tell any lie to further their cause.
<p>
I'll have to find those claims and set about debunking them.
</font>
<p>
Also

<p>
If you have been wondering why much of the music and entertainment
industries have been in decline (economic down turns and piracy aside)
it is because most of the major executives, lawyers, managers, talent etc....
are involved in AA and the agenda of the day is much the same Buchman had
with the Nazis and his dreams of being in God Control.
<p>
it is no secret that Glenn Beck uses many of the AA and Buchman slogans in
his public speaking as he is an admitted member of AA,  just as Margaret Chow
and Anthony Hopkins have.

<p>
my point is that I have been seeing a very disturbing pattern in the media
and entertainment industries of mass indoctrination and promotion of
artists, media personalities that are AA cult members  free
to the extent that they are rivaling the Scientologists in Hollywood.

<p>
Please look in to all of this and please expose ALL of it

<p>
Thank you

<p>
Please do not share or display my email address
but feel free to post this

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Leon,
<p>
I'll see what I can dig up. I know that in general, A.A. has been proselytizing and promoting
itself for a long time, in spite of the fake &quot;Tradition&quot; that says that A.A. is supposed to
be a program of attraction, not promotion.

<p>
Dear Agent Orange:

<p>
I thoroughly enjoy your website. It has opened my eyes to many of the &quot;dark ages&quot;
opinions of AA hardliners. I have attended AA intermittantly over the last ten
years. Out of the last 10 years, I have been sober for seven of those years. I
started abusing pain medications soon after being prescribed Oxycotin for pain. The
pain was resultant of facial reconstruction surgery in the year 2000.

<p>
I have suffered depression since I was 16 years old. I am now 50. So, my depression
history existed LONG before my addiction history. One of the largest complaints of
AA and the whole 12-step crowd is their insane belief that &quot;pills are for dills.&quot; I
know that AA has officially denounced this position, but there are still many AA
hardliners that continue to carry this INSANE message. I for one am glad that
anti-depression medications exist. I owe my life to this medical miracle drug set.

<p>
I have had sponsors and others in AA give me this &quot;pills are for dills&quot; BS and it
dumfouned me when I first heard it. It still amazes me how how these moronic, big
book thumpers try to pursuade newcomers to &quot;toss the dope.&quot; I was told that I was
NOT sober if I was still taking ANY kind of drug &#8212; prescribed or not. WHAT RUBBISH!!!
They proclaim that all I needed was the twelve steps and the fellowship of AA.

<p>
Well, I continue to attend AA and do derive a lot of pleasure from the friendships I
have developed over the years in AA. HOWEVER, I have found a more logically based
&quot;program&quot; than the cult-based 12 steps. I also continue to denounce the crazy AA
voodoo stuff you talk about. I am amazed when a newcomer comer comes up to me and
says, &quot;You don't seem as crazy as some of the others here.&quot;  :-)

<p>
I have recommended your website to many of my friends and will continue to do so.

<p>
Best regards,<br>
Wayne M.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Wayne,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad that you are making it, and have
not let the fanatics drive you crazy. Telling people not to take their doctor-prescribed
medications is one of the absolute worst characteristics of Alcoholics Anonymous.
They kill a lot of people that way.
<p>
And they are stoned crazy to think that just A.A. and the 12 Steps will heal people's medical
problems.
They are just as bad as the fanatics who insist that only prayer should be used to heal
sick children.
<p>
Yes, we have a church of those nuts here in Portland, and they kill a child every few years.
A couple of parents just got convicted of manslaughter for that, and the father got two years
in prison, and the mother got probation. Then another couple of parents just got indicted for
killing their kid the same way.
I wonder how long it will take to start the prosecutions of A.A. sponsors and self-appointed &quot;experts on
addiction&quot;.


<p>
Have a good day.

There is actually no program or method in the world that really works to make alcoholics quit drinking.

People quit by either:

Why are you against AA? I was in San Antonio for the 75th International AA
Convention and over 65,000 former self-proclaimed drunks were sober and
leading useful lives?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Frank,
<p>
That is an attempt to use the propaganda technique called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#appeal2numbers" target="_blank">
Appeal to Numbers (<i>Argumentum ad Numerum</i>)</a>.
Just because a large number of people attend a convention does not prove that a cult religion
is good, or a political party is good, or a company, or anything else.

<p>
Here is another convention:

<p>
Does this convention prove that the Moonies are a wonderful sober organization, and Rev.
Moon really is the new Messiah? Isn't it wonderful how Rev. Moon got all of those kids sober?

<p>
And what about Tom Cruise and the Scientologists? If Tom Cruise can get 70,000 Scientologists to
attend a convention in Houston, will that prove that Scientology really works, and that
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard is the most noble human who ever walked the Earth, a hero who saved
us from the Evil Galactic Overlord Xenu?
<p>
Oh, and here is another famous convention:

<p>
Does this convention prove that Uncle Adolf is a great guy, who gave all of these people useful,
productive lives?

<p>
The reason that I criticize Alcoholics Anonymous is because it is just another cult religion,
not a working cure for alcoholism.
<p>
Lastly, and most importantly, you are mistaken in assuming that the Alcoholics Anonymous organization
is due the credit for
<font color="black">
&quot;65,000 former self-proclaimed drunks ... sober and leading useful lives&quot;</font>.
The truth is, either people sober themselves up and repair their own lives, or they don't.
A.A. never does it for people. It can't.
A.A. just steals the credit for the hard work of the few winners, while disavowing any responsibility
for the many more failures (the millions of alcoholics who didn't go to the convention).
<p>
I'm pretty sure that, at that convention, nobody talked about the actual
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">very
low A.A. success rate and very high A.A. death rate</a>. All of the bragging about how many
people attended the A.A. convention is pretty meaningless in the face of the A.A. failure rate
and death rate.

<p>
&quot;Before we can be friends,  i got the impression from somthing you wrote that seemed
to say that people who were pagan and chose a pagan higher power were absurd. to me
thats as insulting as bill w. saying that those who wont believe are belligerant. i
wanted to come to you for a second opinion on a.a....but if my religion is going to
be a problem than should i go somewhere else? well i have been a member for 7 years
of a.a....im now three years sober. i have completed the 12 steps.. done some
service work etc,and im starting to notice that there is ALOT of strange stuff that
goes on in a.a... im also a former scientologist and if i hadnt believed i was gonna
die because of my &quot;disease&quot; i might not have joined at all. i would like to discuss
the weird stuff that i cant talk to my sponsor about......... tim&quot;

<p>

Hello Timothy,
<p>
Thanks for the message and the question. Yes, I'm the same Orange Papers.
<p>
I didn't mean to insult or put down the Pagans. I just find the idea of somebody going to an
A.A. meeting and praying for Thor or Loki or Wotan to make him quit drinking to be too far off the
deep end to take seriously.
<p>
Yes, we can discuss whatever your sponsor won't.
<p>
Have a good day now.

I Just found your web site and began to study it and I have to say that it is very
well put together. Im a recovered Alcoholic who believes that had it not been for
Alcoholic Anonymous I probably would have died. You make some really strong
statements and Im just curious why all the hate for our fellowship? We know we are
not for everyone that has been proven over the years but it is the only thing that
worked for us. Bill Wilson was a ego driven man no doubt but he also did a huge
amount of good for all of us! I wonder why all the negative writing and research
about this subject? Is there something that is so distasteful about us tht you feel
it your responsibility to try to treat us as though we are a dangerous cult? Why
spend so much time researching and writing about something you don't believe in?
<p>
Whats the point---I mean really? the only way I think you can say we are a lie is to
work the program honestly and then if it doesn't then you can say we are a lie. I
was at the point of death and AA brought me back life thank God for that. The
articles I have read sound like you took bits and pieces that seem to further your
point of view and expounded on them and not the entire passage.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Don,
<p>
Congratulations on sobering yourself up. You did it. An old pro-Nazi cult religion from the
nineteen-thirties did not do it.
<p>
What's the point? The point is to get the truth out there, to tell people the real facts about
alcoholism and addiction and recovery, something that A.A. will not do.
All of the A.A. jabber about &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; is pure hypocrisy.
<p>
The truth is that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. is a failure as a cure for alcoholism</a>
that kills more people than it helps.
And A.A. lies about that at the start of every meeting.
<font color="#4f007f">
 <i>&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail...&quot;</i>
</font>
And that does make it a dangerous cult.
<p>
Lastly, you claim that A.A. saved your life. But if you had gone to the local Tiddly-Winks Society,
and they told you,
<font color="#4f007f">
 &quot;Just play tiddly-winks. Every time you want to drink, just play tiddly-winks.
Never drink; just play tiddly-winks.
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;</font>,
and if you had really
thoroughly followed those instructions, then you would have gotten sober that way and now you
would be declaring that the Tiddly-Winks Society saved your life.

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Hi, I am recently sober 176 days. I have never been happier in my life. I
stumbled on Orange Papers a couple of years ago and always kept it because I
knew I wanted to get sober.
<p>
 There is nothing out here where I live in the
woods  except one AA meeting on Sunday nights. I got my sponsor before hand
and I  wasn't driving due to medical problems so I depended on her and her
husband both  in the AA program for about 25 years. They act like people in a
cult, I felt  uncomfortable, but again, they were my only ride. They would
take me to two  other meetings in adjoining towns. Then at three months she
dumps me, no  explaination,,,,,,,,,,left a real rotten taste in my mouth.
<p>
The last thing I  said to her was I felt I wasn't moving enough in the  steps,
she was  keeping me stagnant, I tried to say a third step prayer to her for
6 weeks and  did all kinds of other 'homework' so to speak, never responded
to any of my  calls or emails after I told her I got an online sponsor and
I was going to do a  Back to Basics program, that was the last time I heard
from her. She told me she  was not for a profit organization and I explained
it wasnt. Didn't matter, never  heard from her again. I sent her your link,
and she ridiculed it, why I dont  know. Maybe I am to strong willed for her.
I dont follow anyone.
<p>
Anyways, I just  wanted to take my hat off to you and
I have barely scratched the service of your  information, I think I will be
reading for quite sometime. Thank  you............for reading my email.

Hi,

<p>
I'm a recovered heroin addict living in the EU. I was forcefully
placed within the walls of a 12-step &quot;home&quot; (treatment centre, located
in the middle of the woods).

<p>
Never before had I experienced such agony, scrutiny and breaking down
of the mind. We spent probably five hours of each day attending group
classes, NA-meetings and &quot;mirroring&quot; each other, which was a fancier
term for   attacking each other verbally.
<p>
The inhabitants of the centre were brainwashed to the extent that
they had lost all form of individual thinking, resorted to speak in
&quot;12-step language&quot;. People were reporting each move you took and any
oppressive thought expressed.

<p>
Upon this we were forced to work in the steps, with which I couldn't
cope, since I am a thinking human being. The brainwashing infested
every pore of our daily lives, but I withstood it, and was eventually
thrown out because of my oppressing (which, since I was under forceful
custody for my addiction, ended me up in a locked facility, but that's
another story).

<p>
I have been longing for some explanations and criticism against this
very dangerous cult of religiousness, because I have so far not come
along anybody sharing my view.

<p>
I have now been clean for about 10 months, thanks to the Suboxone
medication (buprenorphine/naloxone, blocks the opiate receptors in the
brain and thus reduces opiate cravings), without any help from the
twelve steps. The experience has left me scarred for life, and I will
now try to spread the message and facts of the real deal of the NA/AA
movement.

<p>
Thank you for a great site!

<p>
Please, I ask that if you publish my email on your site, do not
include my email adress or name. I also want to excuse for my poor
english, it is only my second language.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello &quot;Name Deleted&quot;,

Thank you for the letter. I hope you are doing well. Congratulations on your recovery time,

means that A.A.  indoctrination is
positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some  tests have shown
that _even receiving no treatment at  all for alcoholism is much better than
receiving A.A.  treatment_

<p>
Where did he get this information?

<p>

the
rest  are his own words.

<br>
 produces a very
compelling argument against AA as a cure for alcoholism with a dataset that
is a little bit flawed in it's base assumption.  You assume a 1-to-1 ratio
of 1st day recipients to potential 1 year recipients.  This is a flawed
assumption due to the fact that you have people picking up repeated 1, 30,
60 and even 90 day chips on their way to attaining their 1 year chip.  Hence
the colloquialism &quot;Desire Chip&quot; for the whites.  You should also assume that
people die off at the same rate as the general population, explaining some
of the attrition.  I'm a bit busy these days with a project but might turn
to the dataset and try to produce a model that more accurately estimates the
attrition curve.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Arni,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Nope, no false assumption. I clearly said that such calculations
were not scientific or 100% reliable. And we have errors on both ends, but they tend to cancel
each other out:
At the start, there are people who pick up several first-day &quot;Just For Today&quot; coins.
And at the other end, we have people who are so proud of themselves for making it for 10 or 20 years
that they are driving all over town, from one meeting to another, and picking up a coin at each
meeting so that they can hear the crowd cheering for them again and again.
<p>
Nevertheless, the sales figures for those coins reveal an enormous drop-out rate.
</font>
<p>
I value your contribution to the debate.  I know people that have had bad
recovery histories but managed to attain the promises of &quot;happy joyous and
free&quot; through the current resurgence of Big Book AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But &quot;Big Book A.A.&quot; is just another fundamentalist religion.
</font>
<p>
Some 18 years ago I had problems with alcohol and drugs and did 28 days in
rehab joining the &quot;meeting-makers-make-it&quot; type of AA that was around at
that time.  After 2 years I was tired of complaining at meetings that I
didn't attend enough meetings and decided to stop.  The fear of relapse was
always present for the next few years until I came across a radio station
broadcasting speaker meetings from Big Book studies.  First thought I had
was that it was an Evangelist station but quickly realized it's nature.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Your first guess was correct. It was an evangelist station.
</font>
<p>
I listened to it for about half a year, taking in a totally different
message from my earlier experience of AA.  It was through this material I
realized that I WASN'T an alcoholic or a drug addict.  I realized that I had
removed the drugs and the alcohol and my life was getting better.  The
experience of the true alcoholic and drug addict is that you remove the
substance and they go insane.  The classification &quot;Problem Drinker&quot; was much
more appropriate.  I did need to divorce myself from the substances, but
once chemically free, could go about my life as long as I was guided by
fellowship with my brothers and sisters of the human race, but not greed and
selfishness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't know where you get the idea that
<font color="black">
&quot;The experience of the true alcoholic and drug addict is that you
remove the substance and they go insane.&quot;
</font><br>
A badly addicted person will go into withdrawal without a continued supply of his drug of choice,
but there is no evidence that &quot;alcoholics and addicts go insane if you remove the substance&quot;.
After they are detoxed, they are pretty much like the rest of us who have had substance use problems.
<p>
Nevertheless, I agree that you can just quit your bad habits and get on with your life.
You don't need to label yourself &quot;alcoholic&quot; or &quot;addict&quot; forever.
The whole classification of &quot;Problem Drinker&quot; versus &quot;Alcoholic&quot; is merely a false dichotomy.
It's just a subjective judgement call and all a matter of degree.
And many fashionably rich people like to use the euphemism &quot;Heavy Drinker&quot;,
rather than say that they are an alcoholic.

</font>
<p>
In a weird way, the Big Book gave me my freedom back.  Not by convincing me
of the 12-step life (which incidentally I find appealing and the
abstractions of which guide much of what I do.  When you analyze the 12
steps you find the program wants you to 1. break your cycle of spree and
remorse 2. list the harms you made and amend the wrongs 3. live a life of
love and free from the pain of your past), but by showing me a diagnostic
tool to detect causes and effects in my life.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I totally disagree. The 12 Steps are just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's fascist cult religion</a>,
which Bill Wilson copied and sold as a cure for alcoholism.
See:
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps Interpreted</a>.

<p>
I agree that AA has a QA problem.  I read a letter on your page referring to
a sponsor as life-coach.  My understanding of the sponsor concept is they
should ensure the sponsee do the steps promptly and get involved in service
work.  This sounds as a much better approach than &quot;wait a while&quot; approach I
was subjected to back in the 90's.  People need solutions to their problems
NOW, not in 6 months or a year.  Doing 123 is what actually brought people
to the doors of recovery, saying they should wait 3,6,9 months or a year to
proceed with the work is tantamount to ask an arsonist to safeguard some
petrol.  In the same vein is it equally arsonistic for a sponsor to
contradict the prescriptions of a physician.  The healthiest approach I have
heard about medication is a sponsor that refused to work with a sponsee due
to the sponsee changing his dosage without consulting his physician.  The
problem seems to be the evangelical nature an inexperienced sponsor seems to
tend towards.  Purity is confused with absence of chemicals (where purity
really should mean: balance).

<p>
<font color="blue">
The 12 Steps are not a solution to a problem, so there is no reason for
sponsees to do them promptly or at all.
<p>
And yes, there are many hard-core fundamentalist old sponsors who kill their sponsees by telling
them not to take their doctor-prescribed medications.
</font>
<p>
In my opinion spirituality is totally divorced from religion.  What the 12
steps ask practitioners to do is to be spiritual, within any religious
framework (of which Humanism is one) that doesn't violate the steps.  To
examine if anything is applicable as a 'higher power' in the sense of the
steps you replace that 'higher power' with what you want to guide yourself
to see if you find logical fallacies.  You quickly find that worldly objects
don't fit and neither can you rely upon persons, which have no more power
than you.  You need ideas, concepts, principles to guide you to be whole.
The personification of those are usually a supreme being, a platonic of some
sort.  The God abstraction is useful in that sense as a wedge to get you
from a state of ill-being to a state of well-being.  It was for me.  I later
shed that and consider myself an agnostic.  I can't answer the God question,
and I think neither can anyone else on this place of existence.  Prophets
and preachers are usually flawed men like the rest of us and the best you
can do with the message is divorce it from the practices they have and see
what truth resonates with yourself.  Any divine inspiration they might have,
must have divine resonance with yourself too, for it to have any value.  It
is never true, simply for the mouth from which the saying falls.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is no difference between &quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;religion&quot;. It's all religion.
We were just talking about that a few letters back,

<p>
Heck, you can worship anything from Satan to Adolf Hitler as your Higher Power and not violate the Steps.
<p>
These lines:

<p>
reveal that the whole &quot;spirituality&quot; thing is dishonest. You pretend to believe in God when it
is useful to you, but you were really an agnostic all along.
Now I'm not knocking agnosticism &#8212; more power to you &#8212;
but the fake belief in God is not &quot;spiritual&quot;.
<p>
To declare that &quot;Higher Power&quot; is going to save you from alcoholism, and then later declare that you
never believed that &quot;Higher Power&quot; really exists, is kind of nutty, isn't it?

<p>
The rest of that paragraph is just quibbling and use of the propaganda trick called 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a>
&#8212; &quot;Nobody knows nuthin' for sure...&quot;

I most certainly will take a look at your essays and papers in the future
and hope to find more enlightenment.

Subject:  	cult<br>

<p>
my name is Donna and i am responding to your website &quot;Is AA a cult&quot;. Either you
are a practicing alcoholic who doesn't want to abstain from the use of alcohol
or you have some kind of a resentment towards AA (possibly an Alcoholic in your
life and you are jealous of AA). At any rate Alcoholics Anonymous has helped
many people in our world today and AA does not print negative material against
other programs that help people in any way.  You really should think about the
good AA does and if you don't want it leave it alone.  Thank you Donna

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Donna,
<p>
Wow. &quot;A practicing alcoholic&quot;, huh? That's as good as &quot;a practicing homosexual&quot;.

<p>
FYI, in 9 days I will have 10 years of sobriety. So abstinence from alcohol is not a problem.

<p>
The reason that I criticize A.A. is:
A.A. is a fraud and a hoax that sells an old cult religion as a cure for alcohol abuse.
<p>
I have thought about &quot;the good AA does&quot;, and found that there is very little of it.
A.A. is not much better than Scientology or the Moonies.

<p>
Now if you think that A.A. does something good, why don't you answer this simple question:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">here</a>.)

Have a good day.

John Laroquette was the night manager in a bus station; David Crosby played John's
AA sponsor. John had a woman throwing herself at him, Crosby said &quot;no new
relationships for a year&quot;. Crosby relapsed. It was a funny show, even if it did make

MIKE P of LAS VEGAS</a><br>

<p>
Mr. Mike must belong to the spin off of CLANCYS &quot;PACIFIC GROUP&quot; the Vegas
branch is called&quot;THE SPECIFIC GROUP&quot;..
<p>
 I dont hear in meetings or your site
people talking about drunk driving. Bill did not write about it because it
basically did not exist to the extent it does today. I was .26BAC the night
before I went to AA and that was 24 years ago and I knew nothing about AA.
Nothing.. When my brother came to pick me up and return me to the floor I
was sleeping on something happened. I did the first 4 steps before I even
knew what they were. I thought everyone quit drinking when they went to AA.
I lived 5  minutes from the Betty Ford Center and my wife went there along
with many of my  friends. I was a DRUNK and a drunk becomes a &quot;SOCIOPATH&quot;.
they are not in denial,  they just dont care. We had a man named Arthur who
gave you a 24 hour chip and  wrote your name in a little book. He gave me the
30-60-90- chips and told the  group when it was time for me to take a year
chip that he had given out 1500 24  hour chips and I was the third guy to make
it a year. My first DUI was in 1974  and I was an assigned risk with
insurance companies my whole drinking life, in  fact in Pasadena I got a ticket on
my bike riding the wrong way.

<p>
It took me 8 years to identify as a RECOVERED ALCOHOLIC. In my 8th year I
was diagnosed as a CHRONIC DEPRESSIVE and I traced that back to when I hit
my  bottom at 8 years of age. My mothers unresolved childhood made me shut
down and  go within and I did not come out to play until I was 44 years old. I
had been in  relapse for 26 years.

<p>
I have been to an AA meeting everyday for 24 years as it is just a place to
go, it beats the bar stools I sat on. Orange I wish you could be in a
meeting  with me as I use a lot of your work. I tell them that you are either
DONE or you  are NOT DONE when you go to your first meeting.

<p>
I listen to guys with 25 years say things like this, I AM A HEART BEAT AND
AN ARMS LENGTH FROM A DRINK, I COME TO AA because I am SICK, they just
complain  and play the VICTIM card along with the DISEASE card over and over.

<p>
Check out BALDWIN RESEARCH in New York. Dr WM H MILLER PHD from here in
Albuquerque did a lot of their work.

<p>
I finally figured out why the words SHAME &amp; GUILT are not used in the
first 164 pages of the Big Book, Bill Wilson was SHAMELESS &#8212; and you tell us why
with what he did with AA woman. The steps are not there to bring out SHAME
AND GUILT, I had enough from many years ago. The steps are there to give us
strength and power to react in a different way. Dr Bob worked them with
the new guy the very first day, they are no gurantee of anything.

<p>
John Bradshaw said GUILT IS I MADE A MISTAKE and SHAME is I AM A MISTAKE
and he wrote a great book that if it is not on your list should be. HEALING
THE SHAME THAT BINDS YOU.

<p>
Keep up the great work and I will too. I was diagnosed in APRIL of 2009
with STAGE 4 Prostate Cancer and I have not come close to drinking. They gave
me  a year or so to live. As a MARINE I will go down fighting. If anyone
wishes to  respond my email is rustyuhl *AT* aol.com
<p>
Thanks and good luck with the goslings, RUSTY

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rusty,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I hope you are feeling okay. Sorry to hear about your cancer.
<p>
The numbers that Arthur stated are actually about the worst that I've ever heard:
<font color="black">&quot;1500 24-hour chips [given out] and I was the third guy to make it a year.&quot;</font>
That is really grim. You would think that somebody would eventually notice that something isn't
working very well...
<p>
I will definitely check out BALDWIN RESEARCH in New York. I am somewhat familiar with the
work of Dr. William H. Miller, if only because I used to live on the corner of the UNM campus
in Albuquerque, so I'm always interested in what is going on there now.

<p>
I really don't see this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I don't see how Steps 4 through 9 do anything except induce guilt and shame. The victim has to
make a long list of his every sin and fault and moral shortcoming and &quot;defect of character&quot;,
and confess it to somebody else,
and then spend the rest of his life &quot;making amends&quot; and finding &quot;when he is wrong&quot;.
That process does not give strength and power. It induces feelings of guilt, shame, and inadequacy.

<p>
I'm sure that Dr. Bob made newcomers do the Oxford Group practices right away. He even made the
new victims
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender_hospital" target="_blank">get out of their beds in the hospital
and &quot;make a surrender&quot; on their knees in
front of him</a> before they had even finished detoxing, but that wasn't a good thing.
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">The Oxford Group</a>
was just a terrible
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">pro-Nazi cult religion</a>.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day now.
