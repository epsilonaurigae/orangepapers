Subject:  	your AA cult article<br>

<p>
Loved it!!!!   I just spent the last six months dating an AA member.  At
first it was great.  He was my best friend.  When it became more, we were
convinced that we were soul mated.  We were gonna get married ASAP.  Sounds
like we are teenagers?  Not!  Both in our late 30's and out of bad
marriages.
<p>
I knew that he had stopped drinking.  At first it was for health reasons.
Allegedly.  Came out later that he was in AA.  Didn't know much about AA, so
did not have an opinion.  It was just a meeting that he had to go to once or
twice a week.

<p>
Then it was three times a week.

<p>
Then came the obnoxious statements when I drank.

<p>
Then it was when we were away he needed to go to a meeting.  Fine.  Still
played the understanding GF.

<p>
Then he had to go every day, and if not, he was not staying sober, even if
he did not drink.

<p>
Here's the latest: Despite his desire to drink, his &quot;sober&quot; friends have
told him that if he continues to enjoy weekends with me, not only will he
drink, but it will be in wild abundance.

<p>
Now I know that he has no self control, as i have seen him eat himself into
a frenzy.  An entire box of chocolates after huge meal.  Box of crackers for
no reason.  Pound of cheese just to snack on.  Now does AA help him with
these issues of no self discipline?  of course not!  His &quot;friends&quot; tell him
that he is no longer sober, not because he drank, but because he has failed
to prep the koolaid at the nightly cult rituals.  AA is most def a cult.
No interest in helping those that seek help, but to make them co-def
assholes.  So angry.  Need a self help group for those who had the
misfortune of falling in love with an AA cult member.

<p>

Hi Erica,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story. You aren't the only person who has been asking about a recovery
group for friends/lovers of A.A. cult members. Unfortunately, I don't know of such a group, but it sounds like a
good thing for somebody to start.
<p>
Have a good day.

hey orange:
<p>
Glad to see that you're still alive and well and happy (which is really
all we can hope for).
<p>
I read that letter talking about alcoholism being an allergy and it
really didn't seem to jibe.  So I tracked down a definition of allergy.
An allergy is basically a hypersensitivity.  If alcoholism were an
&quot;allergy&quot; wouldn't alcoholics get drunker faster?

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. And yes, I am alive and well.
<p>
About the allergy &#8212; yes, you are right. Whatever alcoholism is, it isn't an allergy.
<p>
I think I know what Bill Wilson or Dr. Silkworth was getting
at there: late-stage alcoholics sometimes get very toxic reactions to any more alcohol.
I have had the experience of popping a beer and taking a couple of sips, and instantly getting hit with a splitting headache
so bad, so intense that I had to slam a couple of more beers and get drunk fast just to kill the pain.
That is a toxic reaction where the body is just fed up with alcohol and doesn't want any more.
That isn't an allergy.

Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Martijn dB., Holland&quot; <br>
Subject:  	deprogramming.<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
Feel the need to share this with you, with a question as well:

<p>
I have attended AA meetings past years,   I always got in conflicts with the older
members. So went in and out... Sometimes sober for a long period 2 or 3 years.

<p>
I find it hard to trust and I have a natural tendency to follow my instincts and
intuition on things.

<p>
Okay I am in now for 4 month, this time I carefully followed the suggestions.

<p>
The steps I don't have a problem with, but the way they are being interpreted and
the group process (which I think is very selfish!) concerns me. Makes me feel
uncomfortable. And yes I think AA is dangerous.

<p>
I know I have drank more than is good for me and I don't intend to go back to
drinking again. But I think everytime I say hi I am Martijn I am an alcoholic I do
self-fulfilling prophesy. And then this questioning of my god believe.  (I am
believing in god since I was 9 for god's sake.) No I don't know anything about god
or higher power.

<p>
If I say I experienced higher power in my life they just don't take it serious. And
with that my whole being.  As if before walking in AA I never had strength or help
from natural givin powers that all individuals have in their life.

<p>
I am an artist and since I walked in (3 month ago) I haven't done or created
anything.

<p>
The only reason I go is that indeed it is hard to quit when you are alone. It is good
to see others trying as well. helping each other in that sense.  I don't have friends
and not much contact with family so to get me through the days I go to the meetings.

<p>
Reading your essays about AA makes me look back upon my years in AA.  From the
moment I first walked in (8 years ago) until now  (with periods of my individual
sobriety). Makes me wonder about a lot of things.

<p>
Because off my (big) drinking problem (yes indeed alcoholic drinking) I am
vulnerable.  I am willing to go further than my intuition normally would let me
(especially letting sponsors and other group members telling me all kinds of things
and influence me).

<p>
Everytime I went to AA my drinking got worse and my behaviour as well. I don't want
to blame AA for that but one wonders.   Is the sobriety of the older (longer) AA
memers due to the slipping of newcomers (or what they in the group process like to
see as newcomers)? Well then they say, Don't be paranoid, that is your alcoholic
brain.

<p>
Not trusting AA is your alcoholic brain.  Well I am perfectly capable to make the
distinction between alcoholic behaviour and my god given intuition.
vin

<p>
I know see what they do. If you question, they make you feel insecure,  even ignore
you,  maybe even in group conscience let you have terrible slips so that you come in
again and they can continue.. And they don't like strong individuals such as my
self.

<p>
I have found that especially artistic, creative people having a hard time in AA.
Cause that's all selfish, self-centered etc.. They forgot that they are selfish and
self-centered in their arrogance of knowing what god is and good for all people and
all alcoholics. And they probably use, what they call the higher power of the group
for their own purposes in their individual lives outside AA, maybe also moneywise.

<p>
BUT MY QUESTION: do you know of deprogramming programs, ( maybe on internet or in
an other way)?  Cause they do not only brainwash my obsession for drinking away but
my creativity, who I am, away. Take my energy and me loving myself, try to break my
intuition and contact with MY higher power

Hello Jartijn,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer it.

Starting at the end, I don't know of any meeting group or program that is specifically for helping people to

</ol>

<p>
Many of the things that you have talked about sound very true:
<ul>
<li>  Like how they imply that you don't know anything about God or spirituality, and had no kind of spiritual
life before you came to A.A.

<li> The &quot;group process&quot; and &quot;group conscience&quot; somehow always benefits them, not you.

<li> They are selfish and self-centered (and totally absorbed with the issue of their own sobriety),
even while they proclaim that they are spiritual and so concerned about others.

<li> &quot;Don't trust your alcoholic brain.&quot; &#8212;  &quot;<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind">You cannot trust your own mind</a>.&quot;

<li> Every time you went to A.A., your drinking got worse.
</ul>
<p>
Yes, it's a cult. That's what cults do.
They devalue you while they build themselves up.
<p>
By the way, this is good:<br>
<font color="black">&quot;I find it hard to trust and I have a natural tendency to follow my instincts and
intuition on things.&quot;</font><br>
That's what saves you from con-artists and cults.

<p>
Have a good day.

I came across your site while researching a book on A.A.  I just have
to tell you that the sheer amount of outrage and anger you seem to
have toward A.A. (and I am not uncritical of the organization) has
the net result of making someone wish to defend them.  A little more

Dear Orange,

<p>
Fantastic site! You've done a superb job of documentation.  The extensive &quot;block
quotations&quot; from cited sources are especially good: a powerful convincer, and it's
going to reduce the &quot;you misquoted&quot; or &quot;your interpretation; that statement's taken
out of context&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sharon,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>
Were you one of those &quot;horrible&quot; kids that drove teachers of all types crazy, asking
&quot;why??&quot; and wanting logical (or coldly practical) answers?  Or did people learn very
early NOT to ask you to &quot;prove it&quot;, because you WOULD &#8212; bashing them over the head
with lots and lots of data?  Think I recognize a kindred spirit (smile).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hmmm, now that sure does sound familiar.
</font>
<p>
The debating and propaganda techniques section is good, good, good, GOOD!  If
something comes up and you can no longer maintain a site (NOOOO!!!! &#8212; whacking
typist for the bad bad thought), please give
serious consideration to allowing liberal reprint permissions. (Mirroring?
reposting at other sites? &#8212; whatever, in the computer world.)  This extensive set of
examples is too darned good to lose.
<p>
<font color="blue">

Okay, I hereby give official permission for mirroring after I'm dead. By then, I will probably be so zoned
into the ozone that I won't care anyway.
</font>
<p>
<p>
Would you believe (in early/mid1970s), husband and I had a high school
sociology teacher who actually spent multiple class sessions teaching some common
propaganda tricks and &quot;logical fallacies&quot;?  Yup, that's right &#8212; glittering
generalities, slippery slope, camel's nose under the tent, bandwagon, appeal to
authority, wrap-yourself-in-the-flag, etc &#8212; and then ***turned us teenagers loose,
daring us to find examples and applications of LFs in the world around us.***
<p>
A LOT of parents had to get used to their offspring shouting at the TV set
during commercials and the evening news &#8212; or gleefully analyzing print ads and mail
solicitations.

<p>
This round, will
have 3 years sober in mid-July.  Love thinking of myself as a capable, analytical,
strong woman with PLENTY of power.
<p>
Trick is, trying to use it wisely, ethically, and lovingly.  A major bundle of
challenges in practical application, but challenge helps you grow.
<p>
BTW, try saying something like &quot;I'm X, and I'm powerful, capable, and sober
today&quot; (or other positive, action-oriented words) in an AA meeting, and watch what
happens.  Air conditioning? &#8212; who needs it? &#8212; the icy coldness in the rooms will drop
the temp 10 degrees really fast!

<p>
First got around &quot;the roomz&quot; in 1986 and bought a bit of the line.  Embarrassing to
be suckered in like that. (2 psych degrees, a non-dogmatic religious/spiritual
faith, and a &quot;show me&quot; pragmatism in real life &#8212; and I STILL didn't see the oncoming
AA truck that was going to hit me.)
<p>
<p>
Take me
as an object lesson that people in pain can &#8212; and will &#8212; suspend disbelief and
rational thought to a frightening extent.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, cults are tricky. I feel like I had a huge advantage by living through the 'sixties and seeing
so many phony gurus coming over here from the Far East. And also the local American
 charlatans and nutcases and cockroaches
coming out of the woodwork. And I got a little bit involved with a bunch of them.
I didn't know that those things were cults, not then. It wasn't until 15 or 20 years later
that I started seeing all of them for what they were, and hearing the stories of dirty little secrets
that the ex-members were telling.
<p>
The only reason that I didn't get trapped in one of those cults is that I'm pretty independent and skeptical,
and I tend to walk away when things don't click right.
I'm just not &quot;joiner&quot; material.
<p>
And then, when I walked into Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, my old experiences told me
that this was like a cult &#8212; especially all of the appeals to quit questioning and just believe and just do
what your sponsor says. And how the program was so great and flawless, and Bill Wilson was such a genius to have
created 12 perfect Steps that could solve all of the problems of the world.
And nobody can disagree with or dispute the plastic-laminated dogma that is read out loud at the start of every
meeting...
And you can't trust your own mind (but you can trust the stranger next to you)...
</font>

<p>
After a while, started asking questions, which makes one about as popular as a
skunk at a picnic.  Hung around AA about 5 years (more from laziness in changing
routine, than any sense that it was &quot;keeping me sober&quot;; no sponsor, nothing beyond
the first two steps &#8212; and those, not very well).  Then had about 6 more years good
sobriety on my own, no white-knuckling.  Picked up later as a closet drinker to
&quot;wind down&quot; and &quot;de-stress&quot; (damn that Lizard Brain!), and to self-medicate
increasing depressive symptoms.

<p>
Funny: it was the pain of depression, NOT alcohol's impact on my life, that made me
act, realizing I needed to be on anti-depressants &quot;as of like, LAST WEEK.&quot;   Had no
problem with the need to quit drinking &#8212; no use taking meds, and also using a
chemical that
worsens depression.  After a one-day lapse, went on Antabuse (my own request) and
took a not-so-wise suggestion to consider inpatient rehab.  Whoooboy, when I make a
mistake, it's a doozy!
<p>
Don't get me started on the rehab.  Jiminy Christmas, 28 days and a couple of
thousand bucks shot &#8212; and almost of it was trite slogans and mindless meetings.  The
only new thing I personally got out of it were some techniques (via role-playing) on
getting out of a tough situation/slippery spot, where drinking might be tempting.

<p>
Anyway, life's become really good again.  There's been the rare (1-2x/year) passing
whine of &quot;darn it, I can't even **taste** an amaretto after a fine dinner&quot;.  (I use
the Antabuse is a safety net against split-second bad judgments; even good-quality
sobriety is not perfect armor from doing dumb things now and then.)  But the thought
shifts quickly to &quot;way too risky to even try,
especially for such a tiny benefit; drinking is NOT a good option &#8212; you can never
drink safely, and that's that.&quot;
<p>
Powerless?  Like hell I am!!!!  The &quot;one day at a time&quot; bit can work for some,
and that's fine for them, but it's way too edgy and too much work for this lazy
girl.  I've decided that I NEVER want to drink again &#8212; &#8212; and that feels really good.

<p>
Anyway, dithering here.  Your call re:posting, editing, etc.; no reply or comments
necessary, but please delete my e-mail address if you post.  Just wanted to say &quot;you
done good&quot;, and give you a huge thank you!  If you're ever near the Washington

take you to dinner and/or coffee!

P.S.  EYE-CROSSING STATEMENTS, HEARD IN &quot;THE ROOMZ&quot; :
&quot;I think that when people pick up chips, God dances on the tables.&quot;

<p>
((Uuhhhh, can I stick money in His G-string or loincloth or whatever?  Having a
very scary image of a Charlton Heston-type with a beard, doing a boogaloo between
the coffeecups?.))

<p>
Although, depending on your Higher Power (Aphrodite? The Horned God? Ishtar?),
that dance might be a heck of a lot more INTERESTING than your average drunkalog?.

<p>
And what if your Higher Power is the Flying Spaghetti Monster &#8212; (you're a
Pastafarian)??  Does the twisting of His Noodly Appendages in that dance provide
proof of the existence of fusilli, or is it best interpreted as a personal spiritual
experience?  (And must an alcoholic believer in the Spaghedeity also believe in the
doctrine of the beer volcano?  Or can one posit a sodapop fountain, without being
considered heretical?  Inquiring minds like mine want to know!)

Your hostility to AA suggests to me that you are an alcoholic. You obviously prefers
to drink andneed to  convince as many other alcoholics to drink themselves to death
rather than recover so you'll have plenty of company. Since you have'nt engaged in
full disclosure of your biases. Why should anyone believe any of the big lies you
are putting out.

Hello Arthur,
<p>
You are right on the first item, and mistaken on the rest:

<p>
I am an alcoholic, if by &quot;alcoholic&quot; you mean someone who
cannot drink even one beer or he will get readdicted to
alcohol and drink to excess, maybe even killing himself in the process.
(There are other definitions of &quot;alcoholic&quot;,
<a href="orange-letters90.html#alcoholic_defs">look here</a>.)
<p>
I have 8 years off of alcohol, tobacco, and any other illegal drugs.
Now I only take what the doctor gives me, 
which isn't much, and nothing that gets you high.
I also have 8 years away from Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous.

<p>
I am interested in helping alcoholics to quit drinking and smoking,
rather than shoving cult religion and quackery on them
like the 12-Step organizations do.

Hi orange
<p>
I have been attending SMART for some months now and I am having a terrible time with
AA which is a major part of SMART. Not officially, but covertly, AA has become a
major force in SMART. I am constantly confronting AA cultists about their
indoctrination of members into AA. SMART enables this, it is not the decent package
I thought it was. There are so many AA cultists in it, it stinks to high heaven.
They are constantly telling us how wonderful the meetings are and if we would only
attend everything would be ok. I am fed up of it. I have complained about it, even
written posts on the message boards, but SMART's view is if you are attending AA you
are doing the right thing. This is not what I signed up for. The fuckers are
everywhere, polluting recovery with their poo. I don't know what else to say.

<p>
Thanks

Hello Pankake,
<p>
Are you sure you went to SMART meetings?  I have never heard of such a thing before, nor have I ever seen
any such thing, and I've been to a bunch of different SMART meetings.

<p>
A.A. is not a part of SMART &#8212; not any part of SMART.
Alcoholics Anonymous is not promoted in SMART meetings.
<p>
When you say,
<font color="black">
&quot;SMART's view is if you are attending AA you
are doing the right thing.&quot;</font>,
that is absolutely wrong. That is not the SMART position at all.

<p>
In fact, if someone started trying to push the irrational 12-Step dogma at a SMART meeting, they would
get contradicted immediately because cross-talk is allowed in SMART meetings, and most of the people
in SMART meetings are refugees from 12-Step meetings who don't want any more of that garbage.
<p>
If such promotion of Alcoholics Anonymous is really going on in a SMART meeting,
then I would send an email to the SMART headquarters.
The name &quot;SMART&quot; is a registered trade mark, and Steppers cannot just set up phony SMART meetings
and surreptitiously push the 12-Step agenda in the name of SMART.
Nor should a facilitator allow 12-Steppers to take over and dominate a SMART meeting.
<p>
Here is the SMART web site. You could also post something on their bulletin board or forums. Be sure to identify
exactly which meeting it is, where they meet and when, and who the facilitator is.

Always? Why didn't they work for Bill Wilson? He never cleaned up his side of the street.
He just kept on taking and exploiting for his whole life.
<p>
By the way, I'm an alcoholic with 8 years of sobriety now, so I do understand alcoholism. And I know that alcoholism

So have a good day.

Is there any chance the creator of this manuiscript tried to get sober and
something happened during the course of recovery that &quot;turned their heart,
spirit, and mind against any possibility of recovery through those 12 steps.
I am truly sorry that person experienced so much pain.  I would imagine they
are probably still in the pain, forgetting the idea that Pain is necessary
for growth, Suffering is optional.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ronald,
<p>
What happened is I did get sober, and in the process learned that the
&quot;recovery industry&quot; is a hoax and a fraud.

</font>
<p>
The reality is, the program is not for everyone.  Just those who are &quot;sick
and tired&quot; of being sick and tired and are willing to take whatever steps
necessary to &quot;make it different&quot;.  I heard once in a meeting that 12 step
participants are nothing more than a &quot;bunch of loosers&quot;.    Today, 25 years
later, I for one am proud to proclaim myself a looser. It just made my life
easier.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is just a rationalization,

<i>The Program</i>, as you call it, is
just some cult practices

They even got you proudly calling yourself a loser. For 25 years.
</font>
<p>
Some would argue that RELIGION is a cult.  Maybe so, but is being a cult a
bad thing?  .  I think it depends..  We alcholics must be obsessed on
something, what is wrong with the 12 steps.  I could be chasing something a
whole lot worse than that? Booze, drugs, gambling, sex, food, the list goes
on and on. Maybe, I could even chase ANGER, as this is a drug, just like the
earlier references.

<p>

<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Heck, practicing cult religion isn't as bad as drinking.&quot;

So why not just give up drinking, smoking, drugs, and cult religion, and really get clean?
</font>
<p>
Over 10 million people from all over the world have found some level of

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. Prove that statement. There aren't even 10 million A.A. members in the whole world, never mind
10 million people who have benefitted from A.A. practices.
<p>
The latest claims of the A.A. headquarters are that there are 2 million members in the whole world.
And that number is unverified, and nobody has eliminated the duplicates.
<p>
And since A.A. has effectively
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">a zero percent success rate in making alcoholics get sober</a>,
there is no way that A.A. has 10 million success stories to its credit.

I have traveled some of the world and have
yet to land anywhere where there is not a meeting.  It is a warm feeling to
relate to my fellows this way, not matter the color of their skin, the

Yes, and you can also find Scientology meetings and Moonies' meetings all over the world too.
Does that make them good organizations?<br>
I'm sure that the Scientologists and the Moonies find their meetings to be very heartwarming too.<br>
And isn't it nice how the Scientologists and the Moonies are willing to rob and enslave just anybody,
without discrimination,
regardless of their race, creed, color, religion, or country of national origin?
</font>
<p>
I hope this persons way to &quot;sober living&quot; works for them.  Many of our
fellows find it through RELIGION.  My attitude is, &quot;If it works for them,
GOOD.  That way just did not work for me.   Whatever your seach, &quot;do not
leave before the miracle happens&quot;.  They missed this thougt in their
discussion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;The way to sobriety&quot; is very simple: Just don't drink any more alcohol. It works every time.
And it only takes about 48 hours, at most, even if you start out very drunk.

<p>
And once again,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">Alcoholics Anonymous does not work</a>.
It hurts more people than it sobers up.

Keep the faith, and remember, we are saving a seat for you, when and if you

A,

<p>
Hey there.  I stumbled upon your website while researching a somewhat relevant topic.

<p>
First off, I agree with you that censorship is dangerous and that you and I should
be able to express ourself without being censored.

<p>
I don't agree with you and find your extensive work to be rather Unabomber'ish but I
don't care about that.  Maybe such critical examination can produce something good.

<p>
My two questions are as follows:

<p>
1.  Did something bad happen to you or a loved while in recovery one that motivates
your work?

<p>
2.  Assuming your critique of AA is all true, what do you suggest as a replacement?<br>
If people turn their lives around using any concept, real or perceived, what is
wrong with that?

<p>
I hope you don't mind my unsolicited comments and questions.  I am sincerely
interested to hear your response.

<p>
Andrew

<p>
PS My apologies if the answers to my questions are on your website....lot's of stuff

Hello Andrew,

Thanks for the letter. I don't mind your questions and comments at all. They are honest questions.
Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way backlogged on email.
<p>
<ol>
<li>  Item One: Yes and no. Yes, something did happen, a lot of things happened, but I don't think it's accurate
to characterize my attitude as having been caused by a tragic event with a loved one.
What influenced me more was the discovery that what is passed off as

<li>
We were just discussing &quot;What Works&quot; in a previous letter, so I'll just point you to that discussion,

<p>
Lastly, you asked,
<font color="black">
&quot;If people turn their lives around using any concept, real or perceived, what is

</font>

<p>
That is truly a giant <i>IF</i>.  The truth is that 12-Step recovery doesn't work at all and kills more people than
it sobers up. Read the file on

I like

Dr. Leshner was the head of the National Institute of

I agree. If swinging a dead cat over your head helps, then great.<br>

Subject:  	letter to the Orange Papers<br>

<p>
I'm having a little trouble figuring out what you're trying to do in this in
depth criticism of Alcoholics Anonymous.  I can see that you've gotten
hundreds of letters from AA members, but not a single one from anyone with
authority to speak for the organization as a whole. That's because there is
no such person.  So what am I getting at?  There are no AA official
positions.  Sure, there's conference-approved literature, but its full of
statements like &quot;Practical experience has shown us...&quot;  And in the twelve
traditions it says that any two or three gathered for sobriety may call
themselves an AA group.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Thomas,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
You know, that line about
<font color="black">
&quot;Nobody is authorized to speak for Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</font>
is getting to be such an old dodge.
All members are entitled to recruit for A.A., and they speak for A.A. then. And all members are entitled
to go to A.A. meetings and sing the praises of A.A. and declare that &quot;It Works!&quot;
Members are even apparently entitled to <a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">
molest and rape young girls in the name of A.A.</a>, and the A.A. headquarters won't stop them from doing it.
But when somebody criticizes A.A., then the A.A. members scurry for the shadows and proclaim that &quot;Nobody
is entitled to speak for Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.
<p>
Oh, and then I get letters from members like you who proclaim that they are not entitled to speak for A.A.,
and then they spend the next 5 minutes doing it.

</font>
<p>
There are as many ways of interacting with &quot;The Program&quot; as there are people
in it.  Some people say, &quot;I don't drink and go to meetings,&quot; while others
say, &quot;I have a sponsor.  I am sponsored.  I sponsor.  I carry meetings to
hospitals and jails.  I go to regular meetings at regular meeting times.  I
read three pages a day from the Big Book, and I open and close my day with
prayer and meditation,&quot; while still others say &quot;Life's in session.  I don't
really have time to go to a lot of meetings, but it comforts me that I have
a place to go when I need help.&quot;  Some people think there's some deep
spiritual significance to &quot;One Day at a Time,&quot; while others, like myself,
believe in making a commitment to yourself.  Not an oath to never drink
again, because that never worked for me before, but a commitment to learn
how to live in sobriety.

<p>
Yeah, there is some goofy cultish stuff that happens sometimes.  But the
thing is, if you are one of the lucky few who have a spiritual awakening,
you aren't dependent on the cult anymore.  I recently left a group where my
sponsor said if I didn't volunteer to clean the kitchen after the meeting,
he couldn't sponsor me.  And this is at a meeting where I was driving thirty
miles each way, while working full-time, and going to school full-time.  It
was also in my sixth year sober.  So I changed sponsors over to a guy who's
really laid back, doesn't care which meetings I go to, but has been sober a
really long time, so if I have a question or a problem, he can give me an
answer backed up by decades of sober experience.  I don't worship my
sponsor, Bill Wilson, the Big Book, or anything like that.  I don't have a
profound God-consciousness, but I feel like I'm doing what I'm supposed to
be doing, that I know my place.  Its hard to put into words beyond that.

<p>
So I'm not saying that you're right, or that AA fanatics are right, but
that there is a larger picture of AA than what it appears that you see.
Also, I missed the connection on the &quot;Tough Love&quot; camps.  What do those have
to do with Alcoholics Anonymous?  That they send some young people to AA
meetings?  We sign attendance cards for people who ask us to sign them, but
we aren't affiliated with outside agencies.

<p>
Peace<br>
&#8212;TG

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello TG,
<p>
The bottom line is that
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">A.A. does not work</a>
to actually make alcoholics get sober and stay sober. (Those few whom you do see get sober are just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">the ones who were going to get sober anyway</a>.)
<p>
Everything else is irrelevant.  It doesn't matter how much some people like A.A., or how spiritual it makes
them feel, or how much brotherly love they claim to feel in meetings.
A.A. does not work.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">A.A. just messes up a lot of people</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
The connection on
<a href="orange-gulags.html">
the kid's boot camps</a> is that the same crazy mindset that sentences people to A.A. meetings also sentences those
kids to the death camps:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We are doing this for your own good, even if it does violate your Constitutional rights and doesn't work anyway.&quot;

It still does not work to make alcoholics get sober. Every valid medical test of A.A. has shown the same sad

<p>
Hello

<p>
Thank you for your article about Bill W.

<p>
I am a proud member of aa and I have been sober for 9 and 1/2 years. My name
is listed below, though I am a proud member of aa, I kindly request that my
anonymity be protected.

<p>
Though this is not good?.Bill W cheating on Lois and all. This is the first
time I have ever heard of this, I know Bill W was not perfect.

<p>
While reading the article I kinda chuckled?.reason?...I know he was not
perfect, he was a drunk, just like me, I never looked at Bill W as a guru
like other guru?s in the past who do things that make them look like
hypocrites?.I knew Bill was not perfect.

<p>
He was just like me, 9 years later I am still struggling with trying to live
a spiritual life, Bill W was no different. I cannot speak on behalf of our
fellowship, but I do not place Bill W on a higher spiritual level then
everyone else. He was a drunk, however, while his will was aligned with God,
he was given a set of spiritual tools which he shared?did he stay on this
path all the time? NO, none of us do. Why, because we are human.

<p>
Bill W turned over the fellowship to the General Service Conference Long
Ago?he was not our leader?..we have no leader, not sure if you knew that.

<p>
I am not a saint, never will be, but you know what, God loves me and I will
try my very best to do Gods will.

<p>
Thank You

<p>

Hello Robert,
<p>
That's quite a mess of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>.
A mentally-ill criminal like Bill Wilson had no business setting
himself up as the world's authority on alcoholism, and founding a cult religion that was allegedly going to save all
of the alcoholics in the world &#8212; with God's approval, yet.
<p>
It's funny how just any crime is okay if it was done by Bill Wilson.
