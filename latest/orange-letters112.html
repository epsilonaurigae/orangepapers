Subject:  	AA (what else could it be really)<br>

<p>
Agent Orange,
<p>
I was very glad to see that you have posted some new letters. You would be surprised
how much I enjoy how you tear apart the AA doctrine and those that espouse it. I had
written you before. I was dating a woman in AA and suffice to say I no longer am.
Couldn't take all the guilt she took upon herself all the time and the times I was
called unspiritual.
<p>
I can understand a band of fellow sufferers talking each other out of drinking. I
can understand the value in a sponsor but not the way they use it. What is this
higher power? Are we to believe that s/he will take time out of their busy schedule
to help the unfortunate alcoholic but not the millions of Jews that prayed for
release from the &quot;showers&quot; in Europe? They are right about one thing
&#8212; (many) Drunks
have quite the ego. When a man that prayed hard for relief from cancer can't get it
but these yahoo's are saved by a &quot;band of drunks&quot; they must be very
powerful indeed.
<p>
<a name="agent_green"> </a>
And one question &#8212; The woman that called herself
<a href="orange-letters90.html#agent_green" target="newwin77">Agent Green</a>?
What did she need a 12
step program for? What possible need for a non-alcoholic could there be to repeat
this nonsense and do the 12 steps? Of course you cannot go by me as I find all
organized religions to meet the cult tests.
<p>
Thank you for your time, reasoned thought, levity, and being courteous even to your
detractors.
<p>
Good luck with life,<br>
Christopher<br>
(Please remove email from post if you post)<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Christopher,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
And yes, I am trying to get caught up on email yet again.
<p>
About why a non-alcoholic would join a 12-Step cult &#8212; I think that really touches
on the essence of why people join cults &#8212; any cults, not just recovery cults.
People seek the feeling that they are
really special, in with the in-crowd, doing what the best people do, hip to
the innermost secret wisdom that the common people don't even know about,
on a secret mission to save the world...
And maybe getting a Ticket to Heaven, too.
<p>
That has nothing to do with recovery from drug or alcohol addictions, of course.
But then again, neither do the 12 Steps.
<p>
Al-Anon in particular, which is what &quot;Agent Green&quot; joined, is composed of
non-alcoholics who just get a kick out of practicing the 12-Step superstitions.
Their excuse is that they are married to an alcoholic, or have one as a lover,
or are related to one, or know one from somewhere...
And then they complain about
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="newwin11">codependency</a>&quot;,
which is a bad case of spiritual cooties that they get from rubbing against an alcoholic...
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	john_r<br>
Subject:  	Stirrings in the Orange Grove.<br>

<p>
Hello, Orange,

<p>
Nice to see that you are still very much with us.  I was most interested
in your demolition of &quot;<a href="orange-letters90.html#agent_green" target="newwin77">Agent Green</a>&quot;.  I had come across this strange item
of &quot;research&quot; (through a link placed on www.mentalhealth.net, I think) and
thought it pretty feeble on first reading.  This was certainly one patch
of Greenery that deserved a good dose of &quot;Agent Orange&quot;.

<p>
You may be amused by the circumstances that first brought me to your site,
early last year.  I was beginning to fall seriously out of love with AA,
and trying to inform myself a bit better on the Fellowship with a view to
clarifying just why it was that from first acquaintance, I was uneasy with
much of what I was experiencing in and around the Rooms, notwithstanding
the fact that I continued trying to &quot;make it work&quot; for some considerable
time.  I Googled, of all things, &quot;Bill Wilson&quot; and &#8212; whatever mood Google
was in that day &#8212; the first result to come up was in &quot;the orange papers&quot;.
My &quot;divorce&quot; from AA proved to be very painful psychologically, but your
site certainly helped me through.

<p>
One quote in the Agent Green piece set me thinking &#8212; &quot;AA involvement is
associated with ... [an] internal locus of control ...&quot;.  Well, an internal
locus of control is, very clearly, not consistent with the True Belief
reflected in AA scripture and practice, but perhaps the presence of such a
thing might be why AA appears to &quot;work&quot;, at least for some people.  It
seems to me that there are two ways in which someone may find AA
&quot;helpful&quot;.  One is to become, more or less, a True Believer, and buy into
the whole bargain-basement Buchmanite package.  The other is, really, to
take only what you need in terms of social support from the Fellowship,
relying in reality on oneself and maintaining a strong (and silent)
internal reservation on the &quot;spiritual&quot; core of the program as it presents
in its own terms.  This latter approach is, of course, rather difficult to
maintain.  AA is generally of the &quot;Lite&quot; variety in my neck of the woods &#8212; 
no MidTowns, no West Coast Coolers, and not too much Big Book Bashing &#8212; 
but, nonetheless, overt dissent (or even skepticism) would court
considerable disapproval.  Also, when uninformed people say, &quot;find a
better group&quot;, they should bear in mind that even the best, or &quot;Litest&quot;
group is likely to be run by a small hard core of dedicated, more-or-less
True Believing Old Timers, who may make life difficult even for
&quot;successes&quot; (like me !) who are not really &quot;successes&quot; on their terms.

<p>
Perhaps my mistake is that, in desperation, I actually worked hard to buy
into the whole AA thing.  Even my closest family became uneasy at my
uncharacteristic attachment to &quot;the God Thing&quot;.  I think they thought I
was going mad.  I think they were right.  Fortunately, with much pain, I
got over it.  I might have been better taking what I needed (general
support) and clamming up about those reservations that eventually burst
forth.  In the end, this Buddhist Stoic (or Stoical Buddhist) reached the
point where he could neither keep swallowing the sub-Buchmanite religion
on the one hand or, on the other, pretend to do so in pursuit of social
support.  Now, I just try to hold to my own way.  I am not so deluded as
to think that I have attained &quot;absolute honesty&quot; &#8212; but I hope that I am a
lot closer to it than those who try to &quot;fake it 'til you make it&quot;, in the
very teeth of their conscience and personal convictions.

<p>
Keep telling the Truth, my friend.  Keep the faith.

<p>
Very best regards,

<p>
JR

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello JR,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
About the internal locus of control, that's the way that I see it too.
A few people, out of all of the A.A. newcomers,
use their own self-control to quit drinking and then they give the credit
to &quot;the program&quot;, and say that they couldn't have done it themselves.
That odd logic is simple enough &#8212; when they stay sober and say that A.A. is doing it,
everybody cheers for them as they get another coin, and applauds them,
and gives them approval, and
says that they are good and spiritual and admirable and <i>working a strong program</i>...
But if they drink, then everybody disapproves of them for not
<i>working a strong program</i>, and not &quot;really trying&quot;.
Not fun. So some people choose to stay sober by using their own determination and
will power.
<p>
But that completely invalidates Bill Wilson's sermons about how
&quot;we were licked&quot;, &quot;we are powerless over alcohol&quot;,
&quot;we must have a Higher Power to defeat alcohol for us&quot;.
<p>
By the way, &quot;Agent Green&quot; posted a rebuttal to my rebuttal (and didn't send me a
copy or tell me about it, but a correspondent sent me the link). So I'll have to
respond to that soon.
<p>
Have a good day.

Mike,

<p>
This is an interesting philosophical question. Various aspects of
this issue have been much debated among philosophers for many years.

<p>
But it's not really a good thing to try to take on philosophical
questions in the AA history lovers. We do best when we try to confine
ourselves (as much as possible) to factual questions.

&gt; Objective impartiality is never the refuge of the passionate. I
&gt; would counter we are all &quot;agenda driven&quot;. It would be more
accurate,
&gt; perhaps, to say that Orange has a different agenda than the
&gt; promoters of AA have. For example, we have book authors/sellers
&gt; right here on this site. Do we question or belittle
their &quot;agendas&quot;?
&gt; Just trying to be objective. Best regards, Mike

Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the note.
<p>
For the information of my critic in the AA History Lovers' Forum,
I never claimed to be unemotional or dispassionate, or even
neutral. I care too much about the lives of my friends, especially when I see them
dying, to be neutral. In fact, I have repeatedly said that I consider it a
despicable crime, the lowest of the low, to foist quack medicine on sick people
and deceive them in the name of God.
<p>
What I do claim, however, is honesty and accuracy.
I don't fake numbers or misrepresent information, or deceive the readers with
under-handed propaganda tricks.
<p>
Oh, and I do not censor my critics. I am strongly opposed to censorship.
I very much believe in the free marketplace of ideas, and letting everyone
have their say and their 15 minutes on the soap box.
The claim that,
<font color="black">
&quot;The Orange Papers is an agenda-driven site
and things don't get on there unless they fit
the agenda.&quot;
</font>
is false. Just reading the letters that I get will make that obvious.

I am particularly interested in this statement. I've heard this before, a
couple of times, and it is so far removed from the truth as to be
basically a lie.

<p>
In 1938 Bill Wilson agreed to write the opening chapers of the Big Book
for $1000, as flat-rate contract labor.  He was not supposed to get any
royalties from the Big Book. The book was supposed to be owned by all of
the alcoholics, in common. But Bill did receive shares in the publishing
company, the 100 Men Corporation, as did Hank Parkhurst.
See the prospectus, which lays it all out:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005039/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-prospectus.html">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-prospectus.html</a>

<p>
But Bill Wilson then stole the copyright of the book and claimed to be the
sole author, as well as the owner of a publishing company called &quot;Works
Publishing&quot;, a sole proprietorship. On June 20th or 26th, 1940 (the document has
both dates),
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#WorksPub2" target="newwin5">
Bill Wilson signed over the stolen copyright</a>
of the Big Book to another entity, &quot;Works Publishing
Incorporated&quot; &#8212; a new corporation with a similar name to what Bill had
written on the fraudulent copyright form &#8212; in trade for lifetime
royalties.<br>
See:<br>
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="newwin3">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-BB-cpyrite.gif</a><br>
and<br>
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite3.gif" target="newwin4">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-BB-cpyrite3.gif</a><br>

<p>
Bill Wilson and Hank Parkhurst never owned any stock in &quot;Works Publishing&quot;. They
owned stock in the 100 Men Corporation, so they did not give up their
stock in &quot;Works Publishing&quot; on April 22, 1940.

<p>
The whole morphing of the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot; into &quot;Works Publishing
Incorporated&quot; was just a cover-up, to hide Bill Wilson's theft of the
copyright (as well as most of the publishing funds).

hi orange,

<p>
are you in Oregon? i have been reading and forwarding information from
your site for years. i was listening to the OPB broadcast the other day. i
actually called in, but had to hang up bc they put me on hold too long and
i had a meeting.

<p>
i always post as a man bc AA's tend to bash me much harder when i identify
as a woman. so, i posted as &quot;scott hurley,&quot; but my name is jane.

<p>
i'm horrified to think that a measure like this could funnel millions into
AA-style treatment. why do you think the media has this strange mental
blank spot?

Hello Jane,

<p>
Thanks for the note and the support.

<p>
Yes, I'm very much in Oregon, living in downtown Portland. The events
described in
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a> &#8212; at PAAC &#8212;
happened at SW 12th and
Morrison, on the MAX track line.

<p>
I think that the media is basically afraid to be wrong. They keep hearing
the constant repetition of the misinformation like &quot;A.A. is great. It has
saved millions...&quot; and they don't believe that they have been hoodwinked
and fooled for years.

<p>
And they really don't want to believe it.

<p>
And they assume that someone must be an extremist when they say that A.A.
is a fraud and a hoax. I mean, all of those movies and plugs in TV
programs, like <i>The Days of Wine and Roses</i>, and <i>My Name Is Bill W.</i>,
and <i>ER</i>,
and <i>Hill Street Blues</i>, and <i>Cagney and Lacy</i>
&#8212; those couldn't all be a pack of lies, now could they?

<p>
Yes, they could.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Again Orange,

<p>
I've been off doing Halloween stuff and working overtime. Just had a little write-up
about my extreme Halloween antics in the paper. ;)

<p>
So, I'm very interested in DOING something other than posting in the CL forum and
telling my friends the truth about 12 steps. Do you know if anyone has set out to
challenge the AMA's classification of &quot;alcoholism&quot; as a disease?

<p>
It's strange to think that those who object to a cult religion being the most
commonly suggested &quot;cure&quot; for addictions are deemed the extremists! I get bashed
daily for simply giving more current, relevant, logical resources for addictions on
that message board.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Jane,
<p>
There is much to do.
<p>
<ol>
<li> First off write to your Senators and Congressmen, all of them &#8212; repeatedly.
By that I mean state representatives as well as Federal.  Much of the
funding for local 12-Step-based drug and alcohol rehab programs actually
comes from your state capitol.
<p>
And remember that you count for more to your local representatives. The
Federal Senators and Congressmen (Congresswomen?) are swamped with big issues
and big constituencies. The state representatives have smaller areas and
smaller issues to worry about, so you can be more influential there.
You count for more because you are a bigger percentage of the constituency.
And you might be the only constituent who speaks out on the Substance
Abuse Treatment (SAT) issue.

<p>
All of your representatives should hear about the kinds of fraud that
they are actually paying for.
Don't hesitate to mention the sexual abuse like is happening in
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin44">the Midtown Groups</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters81.html#ypaa" target="newwin41">Phoenix Young People's A.A.</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters87.html#Pacific" target="_blank">the Pacific Group</a>
 &#8212; sex is always a hot-button issue.
<p>
Senators and Congressmen from the Bible-belt South should also hear about
just how anti-Christian and heretical A.A. really is:
<a href="orange-heresy.html#no_Jesus" target="_blank">
&quot;You are in the wrong group if you are looking for Jesus. ...
you are one blind fuckwit.&quot;</a>

<p>
Taxpayer money and health insurance
money is the lifeblood of the 12-Step empire, so go for the gold.
<p>
You can especially stress the lack of results. Some bright person introduced
a new term into treatment program financing in Oregon: demanding evidence
of efficacy &#8212; demanding evidence of results. That is the kiss of death for
quack medicine, because there is no efficacy. It doesn't work.
We should all be demanding proof of effectiveness of substance abuse treatment
in every appropriations bill.

<p><li>
Write articles for newspapers, magazines, journals, and whatever.
<p><li>
Write letters to the editor.

<p><li>
I also like the idea of challenging
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA">the A.M.A.'s groundless endorsement</a>
of
the A.A. belief that alcoholism is a disease. That is a position without
a shred of medical or scientific evidence to support it.
It is very odd that the A.M.A. would be in the position of
<a href="orange-letters71.html#AMA">allowing a cult religion
to dictate its medical policy</a>.
But that's where it's at.
<p>
That is just as bad as the A.M.A. endorsing cigarettes back in the 1950's.

Have a good day.

Subject:<br>

<p>
Hello &#8212; Thank you for your &quot;Orange&quot; site. I attended AA for a number
of years. Didn't drink alcohol for 2 of them.  I'm fairly bright I
think &#8212; could never understand how practicing the 12 steps could stop
me from wanting to drink when the desire arose. I have also read and
re-read many times over a number of years Rational Recovery and
although it makes more sense to me than AA &#8212; I'm still drinking. And
I don't know why. I have even contemplated going back to AA.

<p>
Although I agree with much of what you say in your Orange pages
regarding AA there is still something I don't understand. Why would
anyone go to such lengths to get someone to attend AA? What are the
reasons for anyone to try and convince someone else to join their
&quot;club&quot; Why would it be so important that others join them if they are
so convinced it is right for them anyway. Reminds me a bit of Jehovahs
witnesses.

<p>
On a personal note &#8212; I'm still drinking. I want more than anything &#8212; 
to live my life without drinking and smoking &#8212; yet I'm still doing
it. Maybe they are right. Maybe it is a disease?

<p>
Believe me &#8212; any advise would be welcome.

<p>
Yours demented

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and the thanks.
Sorry to take so long to answer it; I'm way backlogged on
answering email.
<p>
When you say,
<blockquote>
<font color="black">
&quot;I want more than anything &#8212;
to live my life without drinking and smoking &#8212; yet I'm still doing
it.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
 &#8212; my reaction is, &quot;Actually, there are two things that you want more than
 quitting smoking and drinking &#8212; you want to continue to smoke and drink.&quot;
<p>
You are stuck in the middle, where you are suffering from the effects of
smoking and drinking, and you want the pain to end,
but part of you still believes that you can get some more momentary
pleasure from smoking and drinking a little more.
<p>
At the moment when you reach for another cigarette and drink, you honestly
believe that this is going to feel good, and it will at least temporarily kill your pain.
That isn't a disease; that is just you being unclear on the facts, and unclear
on what you really want.
<p>
That is actually very normal. Very few people in this world are really 100% clear on
what they want.
<p>
You are stuck at the stage of &quot;wanting to want to quit&quot;.
You don't <i>really</i> want to quit; 
you just wish that you wanted to quit enough to really do it.
You wish you felt the determined drive that will really make you quit and
stay quit forever.

<p>
So, as I see it, you need to work on your motivation, for starters.
There are many ways to do that. One is just to think about all of the pain
that smoking and drinking is causing you. Whenever I think about smoking and
drinking again, all that I have to do is start down the list of suffering,
and the desire dies very quickly. It's easy to remember that the pain got to
be much greater than the fun.
<p>
And you can do it in a more structured manner, too. SMART teaches
a technique that they call the &quot;risk-reward ratio&quot;. I have been in
the habit of calling it a &quot;cost-benefit analysis&quot;, because that's the term
that businessmen and accountants use, but it's the same thing.
I described some examples of that before:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit">here</a> and
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#cost_benefit2">here</a> and
<li> <a href="orange-letters38.html#cost_benefit3">here</a>
</ol>
<p>
Then, another helpful trick is to take a bunch of the negatives from your
cost-benefit analysis (you <i>are</i> going to really do one, right?)
and write them down on sticky notes, and stick them
all over the house where you will see them. Don't put lists on the little pieces
of paper; you won't read them. Just quick, easy things that you can see at
a glance, and get a reminder, like:
<ol>
<li> Waking up with those god-awful hangovers is a drag.
<li> Smoking is making my throat and lungs really hurt when I wake up in the morning.
<li> I can't believe how much money I waste on alcohol and tobacco.
<li> I want my health back.
<li> I want my life back.
<li> You can't quit if you keep on nibbling.
<li> Quitting means quitting, not cutting down.
<li> &quot;Just cutting down&quot; on smoking and drinking is like only feeding one
of your legs to the alligator.
</ol>

<p>
Talking to other people who also want to quit, or who have quit, can also help to
increase your motivation.
See the list of groups below.
<p>
Read the web page on
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin19">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
It took me many years to catch on to how the primitive hunger center of the brain would
cajole me into &quot;just having one&quot;, &quot;for old-time's sake&quot;, and such illogical nonsense, and cause me to backslide again and again.
Knowing the stuff that is on that page has been a life-saver to me.

<p>
Do not overlook the services of a good doctor. Drinking too much alcohol, and
smoking too many cigarettes, are bad habits, not diseases, but that doesn't mean
that you might not have a real disease &#8212; either physical or mental &#8212;
that the doctor can help to fix.
Lots of alcoholics smoke and drink to kill the pain &#8212; the pain of everything that
is wrong with their bodies or brains, both from smoking and drinking, and from
whatever existed before, to make them start smoking and drinking in the first place.

Oh, and to answer your other question &#8212; 
<font color="black">
&quot;Why would anyone go to such lengths to get someone to attend AA? ...
Reminds me a bit of Jehovahs witnesses.&quot;</font>
<br>
You answered your own question. It's exactly like the Jehovahs Witnesses.
It's the mind game of, <br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;If lots of people join us, and agree with us, then we
must be right.  Not only that, it will mean that 
we are wonderful people for helping so many others. God will be pleased with us.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;On the other hand, if nobody joins us, it will make us look stupid, like we are just
a bunch of kooks in an obscure cult. It might also mean that we are wrong.
Well, we can't have that, so we had better go recruit some more members.&quot;
</font>
<p>

A.A. also teaches that you must work the 12th Step and 
go recruiting if you wish to avoid
relapsing and dying drunk in a gutter.
So many A.A. recruiters do it out of fear of death.

Have a good day.

Even though I got sober in AA, I have always

how can you believe in this supreme being.

<p>
nevertheless, I met some good friends in AA, and still go to
meetings even though they bore me mostly to say hi

<p>
But I almost died in AA for 6 years ... long story.

When I got sober, any room I walked into, or anything I read
would have worked.. Why?  Because I was ready to stop.

Hi Eddie,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I totally agree. I finally quit when I was really
ready to quit. I quit in spite of
<a href="orange-intro.html">the quack treatment program</a>
and the useless meetings. I could have been just about anywhere and
still quit.
<p>
In fact, if you want to get very specific about it,
if you want to look at the actual moment of truth,
<a href="orange-letters26.html#what_works">I quit drinking in a pizza parlor</a>,
where there was a row of beer spigots in front of me,
and I already had a beer on order that I then cancelled.
That was where and when I made the final decision, and that was 8 years

Hi Orange.

<p>
Do you have any reseach about the minnesota-treatment? I went throuh it
about a year ago, and 3 months after that I joined AA.
The scale of of AA in finland is of course smaller in Finland, but there
are lots of similarities to AA in U.S. Isn't the minnesota-
treatment using almost the same &quot;techniques&quot; with treatment as AA?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Matti,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
What is called &quot;The Minnesota Model&quot; is just 12-Step A.A.
treatment by another name.
The name comes from a famous 12-Step treatment center called Hazelden, which is
located at Center City, Minnesota. They have been selling 12-Step treatment
for a whole lot of years &#8212; 50 or 60 years, I think.
</font>
<p>
Your pages have awaken me. I think I'm much more confident about my
sobriety now, because of your great research. In fact,
I took some issues to the table in AA meeting, and you can imagine what
reaction it caused. Something like: &quot;If you do not
found spirituality (GOD) you will drink again.&quot; Seems to me that they
want me to NOT think on my own.

<p>
Hello Orange!

<p>
It's been a while but I was doing some research in the field
concerning A.A. I just posted the initial part of my research as the
first of many updates which will be revealed about that cult from an
insider from the Summer of 2007 until the present day (I'll be
severing my ties this week by wrapping up unfinished business as the
Treasurer there for I got what I wanted and saw them for the deeply
closed-minded Beasts that they are... oh and have the evidence in
their own words).

<p>
Anyway I was reading an E-mail published upon your website issued on
September 18, 2008 7:42 pm from
&quot;<a href="orange-letters94.html#Daniel_B">daniel b</a>&quot;.
And in his E-mail to you this jumped out at me:

<p>
&quot;Let me be clear: I dont think AA is right about everything, I dont
think it's necessary for recovery, and I dont go to meetings myself
(i have never had a drinking or drug problem).&quot;

<p>
The first part of that statement is the proverbial rope to hang him
on. For if A.A. isn't right about everything then what is it wrong
about? I think you missed an opportunity right there to have him
explain himself. The second part is so true about &quot;I dont think it's
necessary for recovery&quot;. No kidding! He's on your side after all!
LOL!

<p>
But the last part, &quot;I dont go to meetings myself&quot; is absolutely
chilling. How would he knows what goes on in A.A. if he doesn't go to
meetings? Would it be wise for him to prescribe meeting attendance in
light of his own ignorance?

<p>
I do know that on October 25, 2008 at my former morning Home Group I
accepted my five-year coin and just said it out right: I didn't work
the Steps, didn't have a sponsor and don't believe the wasted
writings of William Griffith Wilson. I was going to read a huge
speech but decided to limit it to just me and not state the full
critique of Wilson's little cult. But what I said was enough to the
point that one angry stepper interrupted me and said, &quot;What gives you
the right?&quot; So I cut it short knowing I said what needed to be said.

<p>
I'll post more upon my website about it. And I'm using my real name
now for I feel that I no longer have to hide myself in light of the
truth. I'm not afraid of any of these petty tyrants and their
asskissing apologists any longer.

<p>
Next time Steppers or their apologists make the claim A.A. isn't
right about everything call them on their bluff. Give 'em enough rope
so they hang themselves. In fact that's one of the many teachings of
Sun Tsu (definitely check out &quot;The Art Of War&quot; for it is so poetic
and relevant).

Be well and live well one LIFETIME at a time, Orange! :-)

Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way
backlogged in answering email.
<p>
You ask some pointed questions that I will have to remember.
Indeed:
<ol>
<li> If A.A. isn't right about everything, then what is it wrong about?
<li> If A.A. isn't right for everybody, then for whom is it not appropriate, and why?
</ol>
<p>
I've heard A.A. apologists using those lines so often, and I don't think I ever jumped on
them like that.
Next time.
<p>
Have a good day, and congratulations on your new freedom, by the way.

Hello again, Orange!

<p>
Y'know, a LOT of Steppers really have that &quot;I don't agree&quot; thing
going on. Just reading your mail section and found another one from
&quot;<a href="orange-letters81.html#Tina">Tina</a>&quot;

<p>
<font color="green">
&quot;Yes, I'm a member of AA and I don't agree with a lot of what is said
at meetings...&quot;
</font>

<p>
I just wonder: How big of a file can you create when you call these
Steppers on that bluff? I'm sure that it would be interesting to
read, in their own words, what specific things they don't agree with
in A.A. In the context of poker, you're Phil Laak holding the nuts
while the others have to pretend they have 'em.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Mark. Pretty big, maybe 5 or 10 megabytes before some
email programs start to have problems. More than enough for a good answer.
</font>
<p>
Speaking of testicular fortutude, in regards to &quot;lesser of two
evils&quot; stuff I look at it all as a decision between cowardice
represented by castration versus couragously risking a swift kick in
the nuts as you stand up on your own two feet for what's right. While
the latter results in a nasty sting that one has to walk off
afterwards, at least you know you still have your balls. And balls is
what it takes to tell the truth and call these cretins on their
bullshit.

Subject:  	They are not really A.A. &#8212; Traditions<br>

<p>
Hello again, Orange!

<p>
This is my third E-mail to you not for the sake of filling up your
Inbox but because I've observed a lot of stuff like this:

<p>
&quot;They are not really A.A. because they don't follow the
traditions...&quot;

<p>
Guess what? The Twelve Traditions don't mean shit!

<p>
Why? There's a huge gaping loophole within the Twelve Traditions that
renders them completely worthless but appears on the surface to be
some sort of ethical code. Such appearances are deceiving,of course.
Specifically, since A.A. does not govern then there is no
accountability whatsoever. So Steppers can do as they like with
complete abandon. That includes engaging in pedophilia as
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the D.C. Midtown Group</a> does.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005039/http://www.thearidsite.org/OPAATRAD.HTM">
http://www.thearidsite.org/OPAATRAD.HTM</a>

<p>
I guess since A.A. and its True Believers (a.k.a. &quot;Real Alcoholics&quot;
just as &quot;Real Catholics&quot; are those who practice Catholicism, which
means that Alcoholism is a de facto cult religion) practice denial
that often then of course it's easy for them to diagnose it in
others. They are practitioners in remaining that deliberately blind.

Hi again, Mark,
<p>
You are quite right about the &quot;traditions&quot;, of course.
Real traditions are things that people have been doing for a long time.
The &quot;12 Traditions of A.A.&quot; are something else entirely.
<p>
Early in the history of A.A., Bill Wilson just made up twelve new rules
for A.A., and called them &quot;The Traditions&quot;,
and tried to foist them on the rest of the alcoholics. They rejected
the rules &#8212; voted them down. The Board of Trustees rejected them too, if
I remember correctly. So Bill got depressed and went into a funk. Then
he launched a campaign to get the rules approved. He finally succeeded,
after campaigning for their approval from coast to coast for years.
<p>
The fact remains that they are just so much nonsense and double-talk.
(I wrote
<a href="orange-traditions.html">an analysis of them, here</a>.)
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.
<p>
A.A., as such, ought never be organized...
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Right. That's why there is a headquarters in New York City in the Interchurch Center,
where they have two corporations, and a Board of Trustees, and a Board of Directors,
and two Presidents, and Vice-Presidents, and Treasurers, ... etc. And then
a National Council, and State Councils, and Intergroups, and on and on.
Because it ought never be organized. Oh, and Bill Wilson is the one who
organized it.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Dear A. Orange,

<p>
Alcoholics, and others suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder,
can have lots of different manifestations of the disease. Bill W. and
Dr. Bob came up with workable solutions for dealing w/ alcoholism. Time
and millions of recovered alcoholics give ample evidence of this
success. Today, alcoholics who also suffer (and, yes, cause suffering)
due to sex addictions, compulsive over or under eating, gambling and so
on, can find practical solutions through spiritual recovery by working
other, appropriate 12 step meetings.

<p>
Bill W. was a great (and humble) man who focused primarily on
developing AA. Were it not for his work &#8212; and for the suffering he may
still have retained, there would be no AA model for other 12 step
groups &#8212; including Sex Addicts Anonymous &#8212; a group that helps countless
people recover from that malady.  No right thinking AA member holds him
up as a guru or a spiritual example &#8212; and in the main this is due to
Bill W's continual caution not to do so &#8212; but instead to keep the focus
on oneself and to take suggestions from sponsors. Bill W. knew and
advised alcoholics to find a God of their own understanding. This is
not remarkable humility, it's the grounded knowledge of a man who
didn't turn back to alcohol as a solution to life. Having said that,
Bill W was, in my opinion, a man of remarkable humility, as was his
wife, who founded Alanon.

<p>
I wonder what you are suffering from that causes you to have focused so
much time and energy on advertising Bill W.s real and/or imagined flaws
to the world? Ever hear the joke about the monk, steadfast and dutiful
in all his holy obligations, who slept in a cell next door to a monk
who drank and womanized all through the night and then got up to pray
each morning? Well the fastidious monk got tired of all the nightly
commotion next door and went to his abbot to complain. &quot;How can you
ignore this monk's behavior night after night? He never does his chores
 &#8212; instead he drinks and fornicates each and every night and then gets
up to pray every morning!&quot; The abbot thought quietly and then replied,
&quot;what you say is true, but the other monk shits it all out every day
and you hold onto it even though it's not yours to keep&quot;. Moral? Go
take a nice shit. Bill W's story is none of your business, is it? Maybe
you'd like to ask yourself, has AA done more good than harm in this
world? And maybe if you're still worried about the condition of Bill Ws
soul &#8212; say a prayer for him.

<p>
I say all this to you because if one suffering alcoholic comes upon
your angry site and uses it as an excuse to back away from a program of
recovery that works, you will have contributed to the downfall of
another alcoholic. Given the serious nature of the disease, that would
be a heartless thing to do.

<p>
Wishing you all the best,

<p>
M.D.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Margaret,
<p>
Bill Wilson was not a great man, nor was he a humble man, and he did the
world no favors when he &quot;gave us the AA model for other 12 step groups.&quot;
That is all just the myth of Bill and Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; a myth created by
the non-humble egomaniac Bill Wilson.
<p>
The bottom line is that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">A.A. does not work to increase the amount of sobriety
in this world</a>. Nor does Narcotics Anonymous solve the drug problem, and
the other 12-Step clones don't work either. The story that they do work
is the biggest lie that the 12-Step groups tell.
<p>
And when Alcoholics Anonymous continues to promote its quackery and foist
a cult religion program on sick people as &quot;treatment&quot; for a
deadly medical condition, then that is my business,
and it is also the business of everyone who is in any way connected with recovery or
connected to someone who is recovering.

<p>
Have a good day.
