Hi

<p>
Your website is refreshing and very honest.

<p>
I've been working the Programme now via a number of fellowships for 5 years. CA, NA,
OA, AA and SAA.

<p>
My life has changed massivly as I have both an understanding of me, the way in which
this disease operates and I have found a Faith in God via the Catholic Church.

<p>
Recently I have started to see AA for what it is and your smack on with many of your
assessments.

<p>
<a name="Clancy"> </a>
I have seen sponsor/sponsee relationships become abusive, I have seen the cult-like
power demonstrated by figures such as &quot;Clancy&quot;. Which actually endanger lives. The
unhealthy relationship and dependance on meetings eg grown adults sharing basic
problems like children etc etc etc.

<p>
I'd love to discuss the Clancy position in more detail. I went to a UK convention
last year (the first and last time) to hear this lunatic claim that the world's
doctors are wrong and he is right concerning Bi Polar disorder.

<p>
Keep up the good work

<p>
God Bless

Hello Steve,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you have found some
happiness.

<p>
I don't know a great deal about Clancy. I hear that he runs a huge group on the
west coast of the USA called &quot;The Pacific Group&quot;.
I hear that they are very authoritarian and cultish, and growing by invading
and taking over neighboring groups. I also hear that Clancy was the sponsor
of the sponsor of &quot;Mike Q.&quot;, who is infamous as the lecherous criminal who
established
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="newwin332">the Midtown Group</a>,
whose main goal is to supply underage girls to old male sponsors.
And apparently, from what I've heard and read,
Clancy &quot;supports&quot; the Midtown Group and has no words of condemnation
for their sexually exploitative behavior.


<p>
But I'd like to learn more about Clancy I. (Imusland, I think it is) and his Pacific
Group.

<a name="subcults"> </a>
Some time ago, somebody, a correspondent perhaps, said that he expected A.A. to
break up into a bunch of smaller cults. We seem to be seeing some of that.
<ol>
<p><li>
There are the Big-Book-beaters, whose main emphasis is fundamentalist religion.
<p><li>
And there are the &quot;Back to the Basics&quot; fanatics who insist that A.A. was great and
had
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin36">
a 75% success rate way back in the &quot;Good Old Days&quot;</a>.

<p><li>
There are even some &quot;back to the basics&quot; freaks who are so
extreme that they advocate returning to
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="newwin37">the Oxford Group</a> practices.
<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160702041425/http://www.aabacktobasics.org/wallybio.html" target="newwin38">
http://www.aabacktobasics.org/wallybio.html</a>

<p><li>
And then there are the fascists, who basically want to turn A.A. into a Brown-Shirt movement.

<p><li>
And there are the sexual predators like Mike Q. who just use A.A. for sex, money, and power.
Rumor has it that Clancy I. falls into that category too.

<p><li>
And then there are several more splinter sub-cults that are built around the
personality of somebody who presents himself as a new teacher or guru
with a bunch of answers, or all of the answers.
A correspondent listed several
<a href="orange-letters25.html#subsects" target="newwin330">in this letter</a>.

<p><li>
And then, just to make life interesting, there is
<a href="orange-letters97.html#subsects" target="newwin331">a web site that monitors</a>
&quot;cultish sub-sects of A.A.&quot;, and criticizes subsects that deviate from
its own orthodoxy. The web site's description of how sub-cults operate is
informative.
</ol>
<p>
So, yeh, I'd like to learn more about all of them.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Cult lunacy &#8212; part of what we are ?<br>

<p>
Hello, Orange,

<p>
I was just re-reading
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#Phil_Kerns_1">your notes on Amway</a>.
This strikes me as one of the
wackiest cult organisations going.  What has &quot;stepping out in faith now,
not in understanding&quot; got to do with selling soap ?  Or with selling
anything, with the possible exception of bibles ?  And yet, is this sort
of nonsense so unusual, even outside the obvious candidates for culthood ?
Just look at &quot;strategic management&quot;.  Sounds scientific and rational as
an idea but, in practice, huge numbers of large business and public sector
organisations the world over have adopted &quot;strategic management&quot; as a sort
of house religion, persuading or requiring their officers and employees to
subscribe to some sectarian variant of this secular creed, and to follow
the practices laid down by whichever academic or plutocratic prophet of
the faith who happens to be fashionable in the particular time or place.
And all this with little obvious evidence that the practices concerned are
effective in improving the functioning of these organisations either as
businesses or communities.  Does adopting &quot;strategic management&quot; practices
help one, for example, to sell more soap ?  No one actually knows.

<p>
Small businesses, of course, tend not to be so afflicted.  They have
better things to do with their time.

<p>
I don't know.  I sometimes despair of our kind.  The urge to subside into
unthinking, unmindful herd mentalities just seems to be part of us.  I am
almost tempted to sympathise with the Mexican bandit leader in &quot;The
Magnificent Seven&quot;.  What was it he said about the oppressed peasants ?  I
think it was, &quot;If God did not want them shorn, He would not have made them
sheep&quot;.

<p>
Well, perhaps I am too pessimistic.  A nice day to both of us,

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I know what you mean. There are times that I
entertain the same thoughts, and wonder if there is any hope for the human
race.
<p>
I also wonder if the voters don't actually deserve their corrupt lying
politicians &#8212; after all, they keep electing those bozos.
How could they be so stupid?
(Although, I must say that this last election was a breath of fresh air.)
<p>
And then I remember that the real struggle in this life
is to give people better than they deserve.  That is, people like Christ and
Buddha didn't just give the foolish people what they deserved, they tried to give
the people something more and better than that.
<p>
But of course they &#8212; or the Buddhists at least &#8212; also had very philosophical resigned attitudes like the
Bodhisatva thing that says, &quot;The suffering of the people is without measure.
I vow to end all of their suffering. The number of sentient beings is limitless. I vow to
liberate all of them.&quot;
Obviously, that's going to take a while.
<p>
And then I'm reminded of the Sufi story that went something like this:

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

A wandering dervish came upon a village where the people were running and screaming
in fear. The dervish asked them what was the matter. They answered, &quot;There is a monster
in the fields.&quot;
<p>
The dervish went to the field to see the monster, and found a large watermelon.
He pulled out his knife, and cut himself a big slice of it,
and sat down in the field and ate it.
<p>
When the people saw the red juice rolling down his cheeks,
they reacted with horror. &quot;Oh look, he's
also a monster!&quot; And they killed him.
<p>
Later, another dervish came upon the same village, and saw the same scene of fear
and panic. Again, they told him about the monster in the field.
 When the dervish discovered the watermelon in the field, he pulled out his knife
and stabbed the watermelon. Then he announced to the villagers, &quot;I have killed the
monster for you. You are safe now. I will dwell among you and protect you from such monsters,
and also teach you about monsters and other things.&quot;
<p>
And in that way he gradually enlightened the villagers.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(At which point, my cynical mind says, &quot;Fat chance.&quot;)
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;P.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Question about numbers<br>

<p>
Dear Agent Orange:

<p>
In the section of the Orange Papers:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths</a>

&#8212; 
there is one table that shows relevant numbers for those who received no
treatment, and the success/failure rates therein.

<p>
My question is: have there been further studies of no treatment? I can only
guess that the AA argument against presenting &quot;no treatment&quot; numbers is that
where do the no treatment numbers come from? Are they an adequate
representation of a cross-segment of the portion of society that drinks
problematically and recovers independently? I guess the &quot;big&quot; question is
how do those numbers get further verified?

<p>
I ask, because I am extremely interested in discussing these matters in
further detail, because I am considering the risk of Employee Assistance
Programs that are prevalent throughout the United States &#8212; and EAP
volunteers and workers recommending 12-step programs to people, either
knowingly or ignorantly placing people at risk by referring them to what is,
in essence, a religious cult.

<p>
Your feedback and thoughts are appreciated.

<p>
Thanks
P. (if you publicly post this, please don't use my name)

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi, P.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and a good question.  Some parts of your question are
very difficult to answer, like how cross-sections are selected.
Such studies are always problematic because alcoholics who quit on their own
are often silent &#8212; they don't care to advertise the fact that they once
had a drinking problem, and they often really don't like to label themselves as
&quot;alcoholics&quot;.
<p>
However, we know some things:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Dr. Vaillant synthesized his control group from a sample of untreated alcoholics,
but he seems to have done it in a fair and unbiased manner, which makes it a valid
technique.

<p><li>
In three other tests, the doctors really had randomly-selected control groups in true
&quot;<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>&quot;.
That means that you
get a group of alcoholics from somewhere &#8212; traffic courts or hospital treatment
programs, or something, and randomly divide the alcoholics into two equivalent groups.
<ol bullet="A">
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A. increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive.
</ol>


<p><li>
And then there was the test in London by <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Drs.
Orford and Edwards</a>, who found that having a doctor talk to the patient for
just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of expensive A.A.-based
treatment that used the full facilities of the hospital.
In that test, there was no group that got &quot;absolutely no treatment&quot;,
but having a doctor talk to the patient and his wife for just one hour out of
a year, telling
him to quit drinking or he would die, is about as minimal as you can get
and still be doing something.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Mental Health Letter</a>
did not say what studies they were citing to come to
the conclusion that the vast majority of alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year
or more do it on their own, alone, without treatment or a support group.

<p>
<li>
And even more directly to the point,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg">Dr. Zimberg's discussion</a>
of the normal rate of spontaneous
remission in alcoholics cited many other studies of spontaneous remission.

<p>
<li>
Also see
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ftnt06">R. G. Smart's calculation</a>
of the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics.
</ol>

<p>
Have a good day.

May 4, 2009, Monday: Day 4:<br>
This was another day of bad weather. We were stuck indoors most of the day.
<p>
The first thing we did was go over to my friend Doug's place to use his Internet
connection and telephone (thanks again, Qwest) to investigate what is
required to get an &quot;exotic pet permit&quot;, or a &quot;therapy pet
permit&quot;, to eliminate the danger of Animal Control confiscating
and killing Carmen (which they could do).
<p>
In the park on Saturday, a passer-by
warned me that Animal Control could do that.
They could show up at any time and confiscate Carmen.
He told me the story of a girl in town who found
a baby crow that had fallen out of its nest. She took it home and
took care of it and raised it,
and it was doing great. She was even teaching it to talk. But then Animal
Control guys came and took it away from her.  Later, she learned that if she had
called the crow a &quot;therapy pet&quot;, and gotten a therapy pet permit for it,
that she could have kept it.
<p>
And I hate to say it, but Animal Control usually
kills the wildlife that they confiscate. They call it &quot;euthenizing&quot; the animals.
It's like how the Nazis euthenized the sick and mentally-retarded people, whom they
said had &quot;lives not worth living&quot;.
Just put them in a gas chamber and turn the handle.
<p>
When we investigated the Animal Control bureaucracy,
we couldn't figure anything out for sure. Dealing with bureaucracies is usually
a hassle, and this was. When I finally talked to a human, rather than one of
those menu answering machines, she said, &quot;A Canada Goose gosling? That's wildlife, isn't
it? Well, you have to talk to the Legal Aid Officer, who is on vacation now.&quot;

<p>
Carmen and I did manage to get out to the park for a little browsing and grazing when
the cold rain let up for a while.

<p><br>
May 5, 2009, Tuesday: Day 5:<br>
This was yet another day of bad weather, and again, we were stuck indoors most of the day.
This sure is getting old. But the weatherman says that the weather will be better
the day after tomorrow.
Thursday through the weekend is supposed to be good &#8212; warmer and sunny.
I can't wait. Neither can Carmen.
<p>
We are still checking on the Animal Control permit.

<p>
But, as usual, we managed to get out for a short while when the rain stopped.

Carmen standing in my lap, wondering what that shiny flashy thing that I'm holding out in my
right hand is doing.
</center>
<p>
Carmen spent a lot of time in my lap. She was very cudly. She would walk up to me and
chirp that she wanted to cuddle. (I was sitting cross-legged on a cushion on the floor.)
So I would pick her up and put her in my lap, and cover her with my hands.
That was just like a mama goose covering her babies with her wings.
She would snuggle in and take a nap. At other times, she didn't want to sleep, she just
wanted closeness and company.

<p>
By the way, notice Carmen's distinct identifying characteristics: that
brown patch on the top of her head is darker than on most other goslings
her age, and she has a dark brown spot on each cheek.
Also notice the neat cut of her brown cap.
It has a very sharp edge, and is neatly trimmed to curve around each eye.
And her back is
a little darker than most goslings her age.
And her back isn't solid brown &#8212; she has a light streak running across her back
and down the edge of each wing, and a light streak across the top of her tail.
And she also looks like she is wearing eye shadow &#8212; she has a dark streak running
back from each eye.
Those markings are even more obvious in the photographs above.

Hi.

<p>
I just read your article about
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">the funny spirituality of Bill Wilson</a>
and
believe you may have missed the logic sequence in the sentence structures.
The commodities he referring to were coffee and cigarettes, not alcohol. And
in the context of the time frame the original passages were written, they
were commodities, without known health consequences.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Kelly,
<p>
I agree that Wilson was talking about coffee and tobacco. I don't know how you got
the impression that I thought he was talking about alcohol.
The phrase &quot;these commodities&quot; clearly refers to tobacco and coffee,
and I wrote as much:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Notice how the author Bill Wilson grouped coffee and tobacco
in the same category, as mere &quot;commodities&quot;, so that the wife
would appear more intolerant.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The alcoholic in the story (who looks a lot like Bill Wilson)
drank alcohol in retaliation when his wife nagged him to quit smoking.

Did you really write an entire website to bash treatment centers promoting
12-step fellowships?  How about the millions upon millions whose lives were
saved as a result of learning about the program in treatment, then actually
*working* the program, which by the way, has nothing to do with
*religion*as you somehow interpret and refer to several times.  I am
not trying to be
an asshole, but I read a few pages of your &quot;analysis&quot; and I definitely don't
have time to waste reading much more, so I just would like to maybe have
your goals and objectives summarized or explained.  Especially since you
dont mention at all in what I've read of yours, any of the positive aspects
of A.A., the big book, countless *MEDICAL AND EXPERT JOURNAL/RESEARCH
ARTICLES/STUDIES* etc.  Please. Fill me in.

Hello Shilp,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
There are no 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;millions upon millions whose lives were
saved as a result of learning about the program in treatment&quot;</font>. 
That is the standard
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">
<i>Big Lie</i></a> of Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. does not even have two million members in the whole world, never mind
<i>millions and millions</i> of people (which would be at least 4 million)
whose lives were saved by 12-Step quackery.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous has no better a success rate than groups of alcoholics
who get no treatment or A.A. meetings or A.A. indoctrination &#8212; no help at all
works just as well as A.A., and sometimes much better.
A.A. actually has some very bad effects on alcoholics.
<p>
All that &quot;twelve-step-based&quot; treatment centers do is sell the Alcoholics Anonymous
quackery and cult religion for a high price.
<p>
I gave A.A. every benefit of the doubt in the file
&quot;<a href="orange-whats_good.html">What's Good About A.A.?</a>&quot;.
But, as one reader pointed out, he could get everything on that list someplace
else, without the cult religion and misinformation about alcoholism.
<p>
As far as the &quot;expert medical studies&quot; that show that A.A. works, THERE AREN'T ANY.
Alcoholics Anonyous has flunked every valid medical test to which it was ever subjected.
Every one. <i>Every single one</i>. A.A. didn't help the alcoholics at all.
When A.A. was put to the test by qualified doctors, A.A. just:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">raised the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">raised the rate of rearrests</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">increased the costs of hospitalization later</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raised the death rate</a> in alcoholics.
<li> And a whole year of A.A.-based treatment
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">was no more effective than a doctor talking
to alcoholics and their wives for just one hour</a>, telling them to quit drinking or
they would die.

</ol>

<p>
Now if you think there are some &quot;expert medical studies&quot; that show that
A.A. works and makes the alcoholics quit drinking, then I'd like to see them.
I have had a challenge out there for seven years now, asking the A.A. true believers
to send me any valid medical tests of A.A. that show that A.A. helps the alcoholics
and improves their sobriety. I have received nothing but a reference to the faked
&quot;studies&quot; of the Moos and Humphreys team. (Look
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys">here</a>.)
Not one valid test in 7 years. NOTHING. No valid evidence to back up the bragging.
During those years, the A.A. true believers have
called me every name in the book, but they have never bothered to offer actual
evidence of success. They just offer excuses for failure like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well those people who didn't get sober didn't
<i>thoroughly</i> follow our path. They didn't <i>really try</i>.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Valid controlled studies are carefully structured to prevent errors.
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS">Look here</a>
for a description of how you do such a test.
<p>
And you claim that A.A.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;has nothing to do with *religion*&quot;</font>.
<br>
Of course it does. Six of the Twelve Steps talk about God. A.A. is just the
repackaged Oxford Group cult religion.
You have to be massively in denial to incant the 12 Steps and talk about how
God is going to save you from alcohol, and then claim that it isn't a religion.

<p>
Finally, my goal is to tell the truth, and get the truth out there, to
counteract the A.A. propaganda mill that keeps broadcasting its standard
stream of lies and misinformation about alcoholism.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Danny N.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Warmest regards<br>

<p>
Dear A. Orange:

<p>
I really enjoyed your website and it's subject. I found your site by searching the
topic &quot;propaganda.&quot; WOW! I would not have ever wanted to miss out on this!

<p>
I love critical thinking exercises and philosophical debate, although I am not
educated. I am a member of A.A. and have been, off and on, for some 15 years. I
experienced witch-burning first-hand during my first two years (1992-94) in AA
during which time I was disparately searching for a cure to my alcoholism. I
concluded that I was better off on my own than in the company of zealots. I managed
to stay sober for 12 years before 'falling off the wagon.' I am currently
re-involved with A.A. hoping to find a lasting, better way.

<p>
A.A. has a statement that says &quot;insanity is doing the same things and expecting
different outcomes,&quot; or something like that. And yet here I am back in the fold
expecting a different outcome. Already I have experienced the crushing blow from
many a heavy handed member of A.A. (AA Nazi's, I call them).. I had to resolve that
my sobriety was paramount and that I would not give into their destructive behaviors
(witch-burning), nor would I be turned away or ran off. I attempted to seek out
those practicing love, patience, tolerance, and acceptance; They were hard to find
and few.

<p>
Your writings have helped me to realize that my observations were in fact quite
astute. These people were dangerous to healthy thinkers.

<p>
I have a problem, sought counseling and therapy, and attended meetings in my efforts
to control or abstain from drinking (drinking to the point of stupidity). Suddenly,
one evening as I was being kicked by an officer of the law, my desire to drink was
lifted from me, and as a result I have not drank in nearly 5+ months. I am not sure
of your religious leanings but I believe that I was added, or saved, or touched by
the hand of God &#8212; because of the profound nature of how it so suddenly left me.

<p>
I absolutely love the info I gleaned on the history of A.A. and Bill Wilson.. Again
I say WOW! Looking at AA in my new found knowledge/insight I can see only a mad
cult. How true it is, but at what point do I walk away and let others fall to their
destructive-deceitful 'program of recovery.' Hell, some have no idea what they're
involved in and are ignorantly perpetuating it. I do believe that AA has some
benefits. I have found a fellowship of people who are suffering as I am and who seek
salvation (if you'll permit such an extreme) from drinking.

<p>
I intend to stay involved with AA in hopes of cultivating (there's that word again-
'cult') a close fellowship of friends whom are suffering and seeking an answer to
the same problem. I hope to foster healthy relationships that hold me to specific
points of accountability (not to drink). I do feel weak-willed at times and have had
success in battling my desire to drink on occasion &#8212; (for no less a reason than
boredom, or the desire to try a new flavor of alcoholic beverage so enticingly
marketed by brewers) &#8212; by calling on the people I am in close relationships with
through AA. I concede the point that it is my desire to drink that causes my
affliction and the resulting debacle (red and blue lights swirling around, and
police officers yelling statements such as: freeze!; Or, get down!! Hands behind
your back!; Quit resisting!, etc...).

<p>
As to whether all the principles of AA are attestable as a program of recovery that
works, or not, is left to the individual; provided they are informed, intelligent,
and resourceful. Truly, I only desire to not be a drunken fool (or to be beaten up
any more &#8212; especially by those who promise to help me); and accountability through
fellowship works for me.

<p>
I plan to continue my reading of your website and will refer people to it.

<p>
Thanks for the enlightenment.

From:  	&quot;Vince V.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	hello<br>

<p>
I stumbled upon your website recently and I wanted to thank you. I have been
a member of A.A, CMA (crystal meth anonymous) for 24 years on and off,
mostly on unfortunately. My story is so long and painful in regards to this
program that it is actually a books worth of information. I will tell you
that I have not only been a victim of the more mainstream 12 step cults but
also from its off shoots such as incest survivors anonymous and ritual abuse
survivors anonymous.
I was involved with a thing called false memory
syndrome. It got so bad in the creation of iatrogenic memories that I was
told I had MPD and I literally was split into 60 people! As a result I went
from having a lucrative career as a hairdresser in Union Square San
Francisco to being on disability and ending up homeless many times.
<p>
I am
going to do my best to tell you my story because honestly I have never seen
the thoughts I have thought and feelings I have felt in regards to AA in
print before. I have even more observations than what are printed, actually
just different ones. In the back of my mind I always kind of knew that AA is
indeed destructive and it seems to me that the optimum goal is a life of
mediocrity based in fear, surviving on base instincts. And then by reacting
from those instincts one is told that that is what is wrong with you. Having
to survive in the program with those instincts one never gets out of it and
one is always batting off judgments. It is the equivalent to fundamentalist
Christian's never ending search for sinners.
<p>
Recently it has occurred to me
finally that my life has been wrapped around and entrenched in this program
to the entire exclusion of having developed a life. I am finally making
headway at doing just that. I read your book at night rather than going to a
meeting. I figure, why not supplement that time with material that will help
deprogram me. I know a little about being deprogrammed having survived 8
years of false memory therapy enduring many hospitalizations in dissociative
disorder clinics with an illness I did not have. I was told my family was
evil and part of a satanic cult as well as if I were to contact them I may
not live if I were to meet them again. Whenever I would protest and say that
I thought these &quot;memories&quot; were a lie I was told I was in denial and I had
to work harder on my healing.
<p>
I mention this because I never truly made the
connection that it is the same exact thing in AA. Instead of abuse its
addiction and instead of memories being created it is the never ending
rhetoric being fed. When one wants to leave one is told that you will use if
you leave and if you do you will probably die. Talk about coercion! Like I
said my FMS story is long and I mention it also because the two are not
mutually exclusive. I never would have gone thru that hell if it weren't for
AA. The therapist that did the therapy was recommended to me thru AA and he
was also in Alanon.  My whole story is in the false memory syndrome
foundation archived newsletter from last winter.
<p>
I am majoring in psychology
in college. I am actually fascinated by the syndrome of cults and the
process that occurs. Those who join cults are usually people that are highly
suggestible (like I was at 22 yrs old) I have seen it a billion times where
people come in for something simple and what ends up happening is far from
simple.
<p>
As I write this I feel a lot of guilt and sadness. I have spent so
many years involved in this quackery and it is always strange when one's eyes
are really open. I hope this email reaches the right person. I could write
forever and still not be done. I cannot express in words how great it is to
feel even slightly free. Nothing of course is all bad but with my experience
in the program the bad is so huge that any good is buried. Thanks so much.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Vince.

Hello Vince,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way backlogged on
answering email. I'm glad to hear that you finally escaped from the madhouse.
<p>
As I read your letter, I found myself remembering a fascinating book &#8212; 
<a href="orange-top10.html#Meacham"><i>Selling Serenity: Life Among the Recovery Stars</i></a>
by Andrew Meacham.
He also talks about the quackery of &quot;recovering memories&quot; in that book, as well
as how the rest of the 12-Step hoax is packaged and sold.

Have a good day, and a good life.

Orange, I sent this email a few weeks ago, and have not received a

*********************************************************

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I wanted to write you in order to share my story, ask a couple
questions, and  &#8212; most importantly &#8212; to thank you for all of your hard
work and dedication.

<p>
I spent several years (15 or so, to be exact) as an addicted drug user
and drinker. I maintained basic functionality throughout, but I was
always aware of the fact that my life was missing something, and what
little I did have was always perilously close to absent. I had ongoing
problems with depression, and had a lot of trouble maintaining a
healthy relationship. Around 8 or 9 years ago, I met a wonderful woman
and immediately fell ass over teacups in love with her. I was in a
relationship at the time, and so was she, but we became friends and
remained friends for years. Fast forward to 3 years ago, and both she
and I are single and spending a little more time together, as friends.
As such things often go, we found ourselves falling in love with each
other (actually, I had been there for years, but she began to see me
as more than a friend). Things moved rather quickly, but in a very
satisfactory direction. We became a couple, and after 5 months or so
moved in together, quite happily. At the time, we were both using
drugs and drinking, I assume in an effort to escape our respective
issues (for me, the aforementioned depression, and I can not speak for
her reasons...). Things were very good for us for sometime, but after
a while we fell into a routine not dissimilar to that of many couples.
<p>
One day about 9 months ago, she (rather abruptly, but I could have
seen it coming had I not been so damn high:) broke it off with me, and
told me I needed to move out and move on. I took it as well as I could
manage, and viewed it is a sign that my habits had gotten out of hand,
and I needed to clean things up for myself. I moved out, and started
rebuilding my own life, sober and much more aware and happy. She took
my decision for sobriety as a good sign, and a good idea, and she
embarked on the same path, with one major difference... she joined NA.
I had been to a few meetings in my life, both AA and NA, and I knew
that I had some vague misgivings about that approach, so I had decided
to approach sobriety on my own terms, using my own power. I told her
that if she felt NA was the right path for her, to pursue it. At the
time, I did not know much about NA, and I was personally uninterested
due to the religious (not spiritual) aspects of it, and the pattern I
had seen in others of over dependence on the program. Still, I wanted
to be supportive, so I told her to do her thing, whatever that may be.
We remained in contact, and were mutually supportive of each other. I
came to realize that a lot of the problems we had sprung from a
failure to be open and honest, and we talked about that.

<p>
After some time, we began to move back toward a relationship together,
and had decided that a real issue we needed to address  &#8212; together &#8212;  was
our recovery and honesty with each other. Things were really looking
up, and we both had a renewed feeling of happiness together. That
lasted for a few months, and then I began to notice that she was
pulling away from me and inching closer to her NA group, her sponsor,
and her NA friends. I kept quiet about it (I regret that now, both for
the outcome and for the feeling that I was being dishonest by not
voicing my opinion) in an effort to remain supportive. She got to the
point, eventually, where the only thing she would talk about to me was
HER day at work, HER meetings, or HER program. She seemingly lost all
ability to pay attention to me, or even to take an interest in my
world or my personal recovery. She began to use lots of slogans with
me in regular conversation (works if you work it, one day at a time,
etc..). Finally, after a little spat about something or other one
morning, I let her know how I felt she had been acting towards me, and
that I felt it was apparent that NA was taking over her life (also a
regret I have, because I said it out of anger over something unrelated
as opposed to it coming from my desire to be open and honest). She
reacted in what I can see now is a fairly predictable way for
steppers, by telling me that I did not understand, and that if she was
to &quot;follow her chosen path&quot; that it was my responsibility to support
her in it. We eventually talked through things, said we loved each
other, and went on with our day. Well, later that night, she went to
her meeting and talked to her sponsor, and promptly told me she did
not love me anymore and that it was over. It absolutely broke my heart
then, and it breaks it again to recount it now. I have no idea what
happened. I had thought we were happy, and at the very least I felt we
had come to a point where our commitment to each other was strong
enough that we could talk about things, and work them out. If she was
not happy, I can understand that, it happens. But it felt very wrong
to me that her decision came right after she got done in her homegroup
meeting. After she said she did not love me anymore, I tried to ask
her what had happened, where had things gone wrong, all the usual
questions a person in that position asks. The most she would say to me
was that she had fallen into old habits, and that was that. I left,
after about 10 minutes of that conversation (she said she was done,
and asked me to leave) and that was it.

<p>
Now, I am no stranger to the ending of relationships. I have been on
both ends a time or two, so I usually know what to expect, but this
one floored me like a 2x4 between the eyes. For one thing, I thought
we were happy. For another, I felt like even though we had chosen
different methods for sobriety, the fact that we were both seeing it
through with so much support from each other was a really big step for
us to take together. And, more than anything else, I just could not
figure out what happened for the life of me. I had some idea that
maybe her group had urged her to leave me since I had questioned NA
(admittedly I did that in a pretty tough way, but I still maintained
that, if she needed it, to keep going and I would be supportive as
always). After a few weeks of no contact between us, I asked her to
talk to me and let me know what had gone down, and to allow me to say
a few things I had on my mind. We spoke for a few minutes, and then I
asked her if my questioning of NA was a factor in her choice to leave
me. She told me that, in fact, it was a factor. Well, that was about
all I needed to know. I told her I felt that NA was making her
selfish, self absorbed and secluded from the world. She told me I was
wrong and then she left, angrily, not looking back. I was crushed, and
I feel as if I was replaced by a group of strangers in a church
basement.

<p>
Since then, I have seen her out and about a few times, and she just
makes eye contact and keeps walking. That, too, breaks my heart.

<p>
I know that in the eyes of her group, I am not recovered, but in my
eyes I beat my monster on my own, and I am better for having done it.
I can, happily, report that I have maintained sobriety on my own, and
I feel better than ever in a lot of ways.

<p>
Thankfully, after she left me for good I turned to google (my personal
higher power... haha) for some answers, and I found your site. I began
to read the articles, until I read them all. Then, I moved on to the
letters. Those letters also broke my heart all over again. The stories
people have about their experiences with 12 step religion are just
heartrending. I can not believe the damage this program has done. The
fact that you are out there doing the work you are is an absolute
godsend for those folks who find themselves in the position of needing
to question the unquestionable institutions of XA. All I can say is
thank you for your work. It is a marvelously well written and well
researched chunk of writing, and I applaud you and thank you for it.

<p>
So, on to a few questions... My personal experience within the rooms
is limited to a couple meetings, and I know yours is limited as well,
but in your opinion is there much of a tangible difference between AA
and NA? I ask because the majority of the information I have found
online deals with AA, and my questions mostly regard NA. I have
noticed for myself that most things about AA seem to apply to my ex,
so I have a gut feeling that things are essentially the same between
the two.

<p>
Also, do you have any advice on maybe finding out more about the roots
of the NA organization? I really enjoy the writing you have done about
Bill Wilson, and I would love to hear more about the founders of NA.

<p>
Thats all I got for now, Orange (sorry for the length, but it is all
the weight I have about this coming off, as it does every time I
recount this story in writing). But please, keep doing what you do, it
is very very needed.

<p>
Thanks again Orange, keep fighting the good fight!

<p>
Love and gratitude,

<p>

Hello William,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
As you can see, I am <i>way</i> backlogged in answering
email.
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. I hate to say it, but that story
sounds very familiar &#8212; so familiar that I had to double-check to see if I
had already printed it. Yeh, other people have gone through the same thing too.
<p>
And yes, that growing selfishness and obsession and total involvement
with A.A./N.A. that you described is
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_self_absorbed">a classic hallmark of cults</a> &#8212; any
cult.
It's &quot;exhibit A&quot; for why those things really are cults.
<p>
And letting the cult decide whether she should break up with you is
another dead giveaway &#8212; 
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_decision_making">The cult takes over the individual's decision-making process</a>&quot;.
Both of those things are in the cult test.
<p>
And then there is
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_no_criticism">Inability to tolerate
criticism</a>&quot; &#8212; she went non-linear when you criticized her
involvement with N.A.
That's in the cult test, too.

<p>
Like you, I didn't go to a huge number of A.A. or N.A. meetings, but I did go
to approximately equal numbers of the two for a few months. They are very similar, and the
differences between the two are largely cosmetic. N.A. considers itself
more hip, and they cuss more;
and you won't hear the hero worship of Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob like you
will in A.A., but otherwise, the differences between the two organizations are not worth
mentioning. In my web site, I usually use the name &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;,
but I am often actually talking about both. I consider them the same thing,
even though some members insist that they are totally different, and legally
independent. It's all the same stuff, just dressed up in different suits of clothes.
<p>
I don't know a lot about the origins of N.A., other than that it's the same
old story of some A.A. member decided to adapt the A.A. program to his own
ends, allegedly to serve the needs of some non-alcoholics &#8212; in
this case, narcotics users. That is basically how
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html">all of the 200 or so 12-Step organizations</a>
came into existence &#8212;
just &quot;adapt The Program&quot; to supposedly serve some other special needs. (Which of
course reveals that the 12 Steps are not about alcoholism at all.)
<p>
And the differences between the &quot;programs&quot; are usually so
small that they just edit out the words &quot;alcohol&quot;
and &quot;alcoholic&quot; in Steps One and Twelve, and insert some other words there,
and <i>hey presto!</i> &#8212; it's now a cure for something else.
<p>
And you know, that's actually how Bill Wilson made the Oxford Group practices into a
&quot;cure for alcoholism&quot; &#8212; just edit out the words

Been looking at your website and hoping for the latest update.  Nice to
hear about the geese, by the way.
<p>
My question for you is very simple:  do you think that the
therapists/doctors recommend AA because they really think it works, or
do you think that they recommend it just to get the &quot;alkies&quot; out of the way.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
Oooh, you would ask a question like that. That is very tough, you know.
I would have to be psychic and read people's minds to give a complete answer
to that question. But I'll guess.
<p>
Just as a guess, I think that the answer is both of them,
and also despair &#8212; as in, &quot;A.A. is all that we have handy, and it's free.&quot;
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Some doctors/therapists are misinformed, and believe the propaganda about how well it works.
Some of them are even A.A. members.
<br>
<li>
And for sure, some doctors/therapists just want to get the alcoholics out the door,
and don't believe that anything really works.
<br>
<li>
And then some hope that A.A. might do some good, and they imagine
that it's better than nothing (which isn't true).
</ul>
<p>
That's my guess.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Hi, just what you need, another e-mail from someone happy with AA. Let me
start not with the success rate of the whole world, but with the success
rate of me. I have a year sober and had 10 yrs. when I decided the program
didn't work. Are there happy people in AA with many years of sobriety? Yes.
I'm diggin' my one year and all the research you present can't change that.

<p>
I'm not mind-controlled, I go to meetings when I want, work the steps as I
feel the need, and then there's this test. Is my life better being in AA?
Yes, if 20 other people find they don't like AA that's fine with me.

<p>
You see, as an individual, not a statistic, it's up to me to navigate
through life and I choose AA to be a part of that navigation. Some people
are spontaneously healed by God (or themselves, if you prefer), some just
stop, some find other programs; I would never fault them for finding their
own path, in fact, there are things I could learn from them. Stopping on my
own with a ton of knowledge didn't cut it, God saw fit to let me drink and
use, there just isn't a variety of programs or disciplines around me, so
better AA than nothing.

<p>
It saddens me when pompous professionals or &quot;policemen&quot; turn an individual
choice into a &quot;must&quot;, I stay away from those people but I respect their
right to speak their mind.

<p>
It is awesome to be clean and sober however ya get there. The success rate
is not important to me, I see hundreds of people with years of clean time.
The issue is the desire to stay sober and that can't be manufactured as yet.

<p>
We live in a culture that reinforces all kinds of excess, through music,
through movies, etc. It's like drinking and using drugs are big fun. So an
alternate reinforcement is needed sometimes. A few counseling sessions may
not cut it. If outta a hundred people 5 or 10 stay clean maybe they really
want to and the others don't.

<p>
What you call a cult is to me an oasis.

<p>
When someone is shooting dope, sayin' &quot;hey, fella just stop&quot; usually doesn't
work, but when he gets sick of it, putting him with others who have stopped
for a long time just may give him some hope, and the 12 steps are a way to
know one's self which is a worthy goal.

<p>
Thanks,

<p>

Hello Jimmyblues,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety and new clean lifestyle.
<p>
The fact that you are enjoying attending the meetings of a cultish social club
does not change the fact that that club is very harmful to other people, and
does not work to make people get clean and sober.
<p>
The fact that you have seen hundreds of clean and sober people doesn't change the
fact that you have also seen thousands of people who weren't clean and sober, and
didn't get there.
<p>
It is downright selfish &#8212; not spiritual &#8212; to say that you aren't bothered
by the thousands of people for whom A.A. is not helpful, or even harmful.
<p>
Have a good day.

H from Edward.

<p>
Regarding the
Effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous had problem with this user.

<p>
I feel I have been doing a one man battle and to give you an example of what goes
unpunished and unbanned take a look at this link:

<p>
My complaint is that I have been helping edit but most of the editors on the Wiki
page are pro AA and will tolerate the type of editing shown below.  An effectiveness
of Alcoholics Anonymous page had to be created to side step the type of aggressive
editing tolerated.  I need support in complaint to the wiki administrators involving
this user, and support and help in editing.

<p>
Past History:

<p>
My complaint.  Wikipedia: Gaming the system an examination of the three revert rule
being abused by Mr Miles that has resulted in bans on editors to keep them from
posting on the wiki pages. Administrator Seicer commented that deletion of material
that was negative of AA was completely unacceptable.

<p>
Entire sections on the studies section of Alcoholics Anonymous being removed,
leaving only those favouring AA, resulting in an edit war and editors banned from
posting:<br>

Hello Edward,
<p>
Thanks for the heads-up. Sorry to be so slow in answering email &#8212; I'm way behind,
but getting caught up.
<p>
I gave up on Wikipedia a long time ago because there are always vultures hovering
over the pages about Alcoholics Anonymous, ready to erase any information that they don't like.
True information that is unfavorable to A.A. is gone in minutes.
That makes Wikipedia useless as a source of
information on controversial subjects.

<p>
Wikipedia is okay when there is no disagreement. I notice that the pages on Canon camera
lenses are full and complete and don't get erased. But any information about A.A.
or its sordid history is heavily censored.
I think the moral of the story is that we will just have to use
other channels of information, like this one.
<p>
Have a good day.
