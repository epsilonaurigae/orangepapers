Orange,
<p>
just out of curiosity, do you think it is a good idea to memorize all of the
data that blows these religions and organizations wide open?  I am thinking
about doing that (more dealing with the Bible, memorizing all of the
contradictions, historical inaccuracies, etc etc) out of compassion for the
people who are enslaved to these things.  I would love nothing more than to
wipe AA from the face of the earth in favor of something real, same with
Christianity and Islam and the Soka Gakkai (of course not talking about the
people, they are human beings and despite the things they say or do I feel
that just by the virtue of them being born as a human being they are
deserving of observance of at least basic human rights).  Aside from how I
feel about AA, I don't know how useful memorizing every little detail would
be (you have compiled TONS of info and all I would have to do is tell people
to check out your web site).  For that matter, I almost never see AA
members I knew in the past out and about so I don't know how much debating I
would ever do with them.  Same with SGI members.  I have some friends who
are still SGI, but most of them don't like the Ikeda worship anyway.  But
Christianity, there is a church it seems ever several miles, tons of
oppurtunity to debunk Christianity and free people from the church.

Hello again, David,
<p>
I guess whether you want to memorize a long list of debating points about what is wrong
with religions is strictly up to you.
<p>
Personally, I haven't memorized a very long list of what's wrong with other religions,
because I would rather think about the good stuff, and learn more good stuff.
<p>
Now I know that seems at odds with so much stuff on my web site, but I don't think it is.
My web site isn't really about what is wrong with religions; rather, it's about what is
wrong with cults (especially one particular cult that passes itself off as an infallible cure for
alcohol abuse and alcohol addiction). There is a huge difference there. I have actually criticized Christianity
or Islam very little, and Buddhism and &quot;Hinduism&quot; (really, Vedantic teachings) not at all. 
It's just that I cannot stay out of the religious debate entirely when A.A. is a religion
in disguise.

<p>
Orange,
<p>
you have brought up a VERY good point.  The biggest difference between the
Zen masters and Nichiren.  But bear in mind that the difference in view
points lies in definition of enlightenment, specific goals, and sutras that
are believed to be ultimate truth.  Before I became devoted to Nichiren's
teachings, I was reading selections from the Pali cannon (In the Buddha's
Words), the Dhammapada, the Heart Sutra, and the Diamond Sutra.  Of course
the Diamond Sutra is a Zen sutra.  A lot of the Diamond Sutra revolved
around overcoming dualistic thinking.  There is no high, or low, good or
bad, they are all ideas, conceptions, so on and so forth.  I started reading
the Lotus Sutra again and there is one part that really caught my
attention.  The Buddha was teaching Shariputra about how people who adhere
to the Lotus Sutra won't need a teacher, from what I remember this was
talking about Bhodisatvas (because those are the ones that are that far along
in their progression towards Buddhahood).  If you have ever read
&quot;Siddhartha&quot; by Herman Hesse, that is what Siddhartha sought in the story.
He wanted to attain Buddhahood, but not with a teacher.  In Zen, the
definition (from my understanding) is that the practitioner of Zen must stay
in the moment.  I remember reading a story where there was a Zen patriarch
who was building or helping to build a Buddhist temple for this king.  When
asked years later what virtue he had obtained by this most noble
deed (helping the Buddhist order, the monks) he said none.  He hadn't stayed
in the moment the whole time.  Nichiren on the other hand would have said
that it is irrelevant because of 3000 realms in a single moment of life,
mutual possession of the 10 worlds, and that this is the Latter day of the
Law (all teachings prior to the Lotus Sutra are to in this time
period-according to the Lotus Sutra, not just Nichiren's opinoin, but the
words of Shakyamuni, discarded as expedients).  If the person was in the
10th world (Buddhahood) he had no need to stay in the moment-what virtue
would he still have to work towards?  I guess it could translate into a
person fighting the desire to drink VS. making the desire to drink go away
eliminating the need to fight it.  What does all of that actually translate
into? (people could just as easily throw those terms around and not really
have a clue what they are talking about as most SGI members do).  Nichiren
pulled a lot of theoretical teachings in his interpretation of the Lotus
Sutra based off of the Tendai school (or T'ien-t'ai I believe was another way
of spelling his name), and he was the one that came up with the 3000 realms
in a single moment of life.  Basically this is dealing with volition (the act
of doing something or what causes us to take an action).  Even though the
Buddha did say in the Lotus Sutra to honestly discard expedient means as
there is only one vehicle, not three (Theravada, Mahayana, and perhaps
Vajrayana but that is controversial at best as far as the third), what I
believe is that what this is referring to IS volition.  If you have ever
read the &quot;Nirvana Sutra's&quot; which is quantum psychology (fascinating stuff
that will give you a headache), and even for that matter in provisional
Buddhism, self will is an illusion.  If a person wanted to change a
behavior, simply modify the parameters that dictate they keep making that
decision right?  Kind of like knocking out walls in a room.  Don't worry
about the empty space in the room, worry about the location of the walls
which dictates where the empty space will be.  Anyway, they got the number
3000 by a math equation.  What we have is a single moment of life which cold
be translated as one mind, one though, or one thought moment.  The three
thousand realms or the entire phenomenal world, exist in a single moment of
life (think of the arguments that David Hume put forth-similar in some
respects, I could at one moment be sitting in this chair, and at another
moment be miles above the earth in freefall accept that the Law of cause and
effect dictates that things progress in a seemingly logical order from
moment to moment-IE Karma).  The number three thousand comes from the the
following calculation: 10 (Ten Worlds) X 10  (Ten Worlds) X 10  (ten factors) X
3  (three realms of existence).  Each of the ten worlds contains the other
ten in itself (to varying degrees).  Life at any moment manifests one of the
Ten Worlds.  Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within
itself and this &quot;mutual possession&quot;, or mutual inclusion, of the Ten
Worlds.  But what does all of that REALLY mean?  How would we connect one
point to the other?  This is in one respect a chicken or the egg question.
The Zen patriarch was trying to generate virtue which would in the end
result in Buddhahood.  I don't know what year that was, actually, T'ien-t'ai
would have been around 500-600 AD.  My point about this is similar to the
example I used before, using &quot;self will&quot; or denying &quot;self will&quot;.  If a
person was trying to generate virtue doing the difficult austere
practices (as they still do in India today, self mortification which wasn't
the &quot;middle path&quot; but just using it as an example), are they in one respect
using &quot;self will&quot; trying to overcome &quot;self will&quot;?  Being that there are
conceptually the 10 worlds, a person could fight and struggle against their
&quot;self will&quot; and accomplish much, only to find themselves in the right set of
circumstances which would trigger themselves on the inside causing them to
take actions which would put them in the Lower six worlds (oh yeah almost
forgot, oneness of self and the environment-you enter the room, see the TV,
you don't WANT to watch TV but want to work on the computer, desire springs
forth, and you CHOOSE to watch the TV anyway).  So if I was the Zen
patriarch building the temple, fighting my &quot;self will&quot; as opposed to
altering my &quot;self will&quot;, how long would it take for me to attain
Buddhahood (bearing in mind conceptually the 10 worlds, 3000 realms, oneness
of self and the environment, etc etc)?  Which is more efficient?  Think
about reprogramming or reconditioning oneself to meet circumstances as
opposed to using &quot;self will&quot; and forgetting about doing the internal
work (just as an example).  I believe that that was really the point that
Nichiren was making.  Also, one thing SGI leaves out (and Nichiren talked
time and time and time again about Shakyamuni making the vow to save all
mankind).  If theoretically (I don't think Nichiren taught this, but it is
the easiest way for me to understand these concepts) there is no self will,
there is only Myoho-renge-kyo (which IS our self will, the Law of cause and
effect, Karma), then we are truly living in a deterministic world.  If I
don't have the ability to &quot;choose&quot; one thing over the other (due to it being
dictated by the Law), wouldn't there need to be a balancing factor?  But
this is the difference between the Kempon's teachings (veneration of
Shakyamuni) and SGI's teachings (veneration of Buddha nature).  In one
respect (even though across the board this is a non-theistic form of
Buddhism), we do venerate Shakyamuni.  In fact there is one prayer in our
Gongyo book at the end where it is Shakyamuni who gives the benefits of
chanting (enlightenment) as he isn't &quot;god&quot; persay, but more like a super
conciousness that is generated by the environments response to human
suffering.  I think of it being similar to how Shiva came down as Krishna in
the Bhagavad-gita.  A lot of that is way over my head (I have only begun to
REALLY study, and I think most Nichiren Buddhist's (that are SGI members) who
are interested in really studying, inevitably they can't rationalize
sticking with SGI).  You did make a good point about even if a person has
the desire to attain enlightenment, it is still a desire.  Again, this is
another difference in perspective because Nichiren had made the statement
that desire is enlightenment, the sufferings of birth and death are
Nirvana.  He was referring to Samsara (hell) being the land of tranquil light
because it is here we are motivated to transform ourselves using the very
desire that ensnares us (if it wasn't for our desire, we would never seek the
Buddha way-changing poison into medicine).  The other thing is that this is
about how long does a person want to take working at attaining
enlightenment.  Does a person want to do it in one lifetime, or many?  If
there was a way for me to simply change my Karma to where I (without even
trying) attain Buddhahood (being that Karma is self will), why take the long
approach and adhere to tons of precepts, as opposed to changing my Karma and
I live without any (but as though I had them).  This is similar to the idea
in Christianity where a follower of Christ being dead to the law, lives
without the law but ACTS as though they have the law.

<p>
I could go on and on.  But anyway, there are tons of Nichiren schools.  I
have even seen online some Buddhist schools that ignore Nichiren but they
venerate the Lotus Sutra.  I did think about getting a hold of Thich Nhat
Hanh's interpretation of the Lotus Sutra, it would be interesting to see how
a Zen monk would interpret the Lotus Sutra VS. how Nichiren interpreted it.

Hello again, David,
<p>
A lot of that is way over my head, too. You make me feel like I need to go back to the library
and check out a lot more books.
<p>
But right now, my practice is ultra-simple: Just working on staying in the here and now, all day
long, minute by minute. That is of course nearly impossible, but I keep trying.
<p>
I seem to recall that Buddha said something like, &quot;The yoga of action is superior to the yoga
of inaction.&quot; So I keep on trying to stay aware and here and now through all of the experiences
of the day.
<p>
I think all schools and practices are just tools to help the student to develop unbroken awareness.

<p>
One of the things I like about photography is that it encourages me to stay aware of my surroundings.
If I don't stay aware and here and now, then I won't see the good shots.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Those two ducklings are siblings, but they obviously have different

a father, while the other one looks like it had a mostly-Mallard drake
as a father.  Their mother is a black-and-gray-and-white domestic duck of indeterminate breed (that is,
probably a mongrel).
Those ducks sure do enjoy mixing up the genes.

<p>
Orange,

<p>
Hello I just read your article
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.

 Although I did skip
through some of it. very long article. You did open my eyes up to a few things that
I did not know and for that I thank you. I started in AA at the age of  20 and went
twice a week for many of years during this time I was also seeking GOD through JESUS
CHRIST. Although I had a lot to learn I was applying these new ways of living in my
life. The only credit I can truly give AA members today is the ability to show a
unconditional LOVE that I was not seeing in the CHURCH'S that I had attended.
I do give credit to AA as opening a door that led me to search deeper for  GOD. I am
very grateful today for the cleansing power of the Blood of Jesus Christ. Without I
would still be lost and walking around in a stuper. Today I still attend a few AA
meetings not to stay sober, but to show the Love of Christ through me.
<p>
My claim of God is Jesus Christ and I am not ashamed to say it claim it declare it
in any circumstane or situation.
<p>
It took years for me to understand who I truly was in Christ why it took so long you
would probably say that I was stupid or find some reason why i just couldn't
comprehend the Bible as it is written. I do know this though from what I do
understand about the Bible is that I was Called and chosen by God to be His disciple
and to walk just as HE did. That if I claim that I have no sin that I make Him a
liar.
<p>
I could downgrade and find things wrong with just about anything that does not line
up with the TRUTH of God's word. People,places,things,situations,churches,entities,
but instead of looking in that direction living out the TRUTH in my daily walk and
showing the LOVE of Christ to all of HIS children is what drives me today.
<p>
I hope  that you keep on informing others of how bad and wrong AA is I am just glad
that it was there when I walked through the door as it was what led me to CHRIST it
was not the  members of Church. There are things about it that I truly disagree with
and do not conform with or teach others to do, but it was a turning point in my
life. We all have opions and views on everything in this world.
<p>
The only thing that matters is the TRUTH of the LIVING WORD of GOD JESUS CHRIST.
I choose to LIVE the TRUTH instead of speak it. Maybe just maybe if you would live
it out in your life you may be able to bring a drunk or addict to repentance through
your actions of GODS LOVE.
<p>
May GOD BLESS YOU IN ALL YOU DO

Hi again, Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. In the following day after I got your letter, I heard more about the final
coroner's report on TV, saying the same thing.
<p>
Here we go again. The treatment centers will crank out a whole new batch of propaganda that says,
&quot;If you don't give us all of your money for our treatment, you will die like Amy Weinhouse.&quot;

<p>
Strange that the initial tox screen said that she had little or no drugs or alcohol in her, and now the
final report says that she had like six or seven times the legal limit of alcohol in her. Odd how they could
screw up a test so badly.
<p>
Oh well, may she rest in peace.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I reckon if it gets easier from here, what I'll need to watch out for is complacency
that allows for Lizard Brain tricks. Right now I feel like it's well in hand, but I
could see becoming TOO comfortable being an issue. But really, I just don't want to
drink alcohol. That's one of the very few things I've recanted about AA. I thought
it was bullshit when old timers said they &quot;No longer felt the desire to drink&quot;. Not
only do I not feel that desire, the idea of drinking is mildly scary to me, and I
dig the sober gig.

<p>
Was the 20th 11 years for you? 12? Assuming you stay healthy enough to clock in,
say, 20 years of sobriety, would that mean the AA folks would HAVE to listen to you?
Hell, you're already in old-timer territory.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Taylor,
<p>
Yes, 11 years. And no, they won't listen to reason, no matter whether someone has 11 or 20 years
of sobriety. They only respect 20 years of sobriety when it is accumulated in A.A. meeting rooms.
They still call the other sober people, the non-members, &quot;dry drunks&quot;, or argue that
&quot;He wasn't a real alcoholic at all.&quot;
(It is <a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank">The Real Scotsman Logical Fallacy</a>.)

</font>
<p>
My initially reaction to the idea of a &quot;birthday&quot; was  negative. Because I'd only
heard that term used in AA. My &quot;belly button birthday&quot; is Nov 1st, so they're not
too far apart. However, as the date drew near, I started to feel like it was
something worth noting. In fact, it seemed more important than my real birthday.
Without my knowledge or consent (but bless their hearts all the same) my family had
already decided it was a big deal. I don't like the &quot;one day at a time&quot; idea.
However, one year at a time I could handle. Same thing with drugs, that was Feb 2
2007. I day-counted for a year (despite lack of involvement with 12 step programs)
and have just taken time to realize another year has passed since the last. I
thought about stopping by the Alano Club, but decided that what I had planned was
not worth my time.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, for a while there, I was doing it three years at a time. The reason for that was, I had been
sober for three years before, so I knew that I could do that again. And only having to
&quot;make a decision&quot; once every three years is much less work than having to decide every day
to not drink for one day.


</font>
<p>
It's funny how little things can make all the difference isn't it? For example, I
take great pleasure in always knowing how and why I went to bed, as opposed to just
passing out after several hours spent blacked out. And boy, did you say it on the
hangovers. I've mentioned mental illness before, and among my problems is some
rather severe, non-reality based anxiety. Drinking was part of how I dealt with
this. However, at some point it stopped being an effective means of self-medication.
All the panic I'd held at bay for days and days would hit me all at once the minute
I couldn't stay drunk. So I'd get to deal with that as well as the physical effects.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alcohol has funny effects on that anxiety. First, it relieves it and makes you feel okay.
But the next morning, it's twice as bad. Or worse. Eventually, alcohol had me feeling anxious
all of the time.
Among other things, alcohol strips all of the B vitamins out of your body, which makes you
paranoid.

</font>
<p>
And of course you had to mention tobacco. At this point, I'm mostly frustrated with
myself for not wanting to quit. I know better than to say I can't, I can quit doing
drugs, I can quite drinking, I can quit smoking just the same. And yet, I don't. And
that is most certainly a matter of not wanting to, rather than being unable. And
now, I haven't got the excuse of &quot;one at a time&quot;, as it's the last one standing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. In SMART, someone was talking about the real key to quitting anything  &#8212;  like alcohol or
tobacco  &#8212;  was wanting to. She said that people start off just wanting to want to quit, rather
than really wanting to quit. 
They just wish that they could really want it enough to do it.
The work is to progress to really wanting to quit.
<p>
A trick that helps is to dwell on all of the negative aspects: the bad taste, the pain in your
throat and chest, the expense, the inconvenience, the stink,
the fact that a stupid addiction has its claws
sunk into you, and the discomfort of going into withdrawal several times a day.
<p>
And to also think about the positive aspects of not smoking: the clear lungs,
the increased energy, the better health, the lack of a chronic headache,
$5 per day of free money... And nobody sanctimoniously reminding you of things like lung cancer.
And hence the pride of having beaten that monster.
<p>
And it is a monster.

Subject:  	Why?<br>

<p>
Why are you going through SO MUCH time, trouble and work to attempt to prove AA
wrong? It saves millions of lives. Doesn't that matter to you? It saved mine. When
someone goes to so much trouble, as you have done, and is trying to prove something
wrong so badly, like you are, the real problem lies within them. In other words you.
Ask yourself why you're doing this? What good is it going to do for people? Notta,
zilch, nothing. You are offering nothing, when you should look within. There is
where the real problem lies.

<p>
I wish you the best in life,

<p>
Jules

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jules,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the good wishes.
I also wish you the best in life.
<p>
Alas, you are grossly misinformed about A.A.
<p>
<ol>
<li> A.A. has not saved millions.
That is just a standard A.A. lie. Zero truth to it.
All that A.A. does is steal the credit for a few people who were going to quit drinking anyway.
Often, they really quit before they came to A.A., and then A.A. fooled them into believing
that A.A. made them quit, or &quot;keeps them sober&quot;.
<p>
Even Bill Wilson himself documented the fact that A.A. was merely recruiting those people who
were going to quit real soon now, and failing with all of the others.  In a letter to a
discouraged A.A. recruiter, he wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As a matter of fact, the successful worker [A.A. recruiter]
differs from the unsuccessful one only in being lucky about
his prospects. He simply hits cases who are ready and able
to stop at once. Given the same prospects, the seemingly
unsuccessful person would have produced almost the same
results.  In other words, you have to work on a lot of cases
before the law of averages commences to assert itself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   So cheerio, Jennie &#8212; it ain't your fault.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
== <i>'PASS IT ON', The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached the world</i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. staff, 1984, pages 251-252.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
A.A. has not &quot;saved millions&quot;.

A.A. does not even have 2 million members in the whole world,
and most A.A. members do not ever get much sober time.
The vast majority of A.A. members will drop out, and half of them will die drunk, and the other half
will save their own lives without A.A.
Ninety-five percent of the A.A. newcomers leave in the first year, and then the
attrition continues. Only one percent of the A.A. newcomers pick up the 10-year coin. Less than
1 in a thousand get the 20-year coin.
<p>
Read these two items for more on that:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="newwin38">the counts of sobriety
&quot;medallions&quot; or &quot;coins&quot; given out</a>.
<li>
<a href="orange-letters132.html#NB" target="newwin82">a spreadsheet about the Foxhall Group's retention
rate</a>. Actually, the lack thereof.
</ul>
<p>
And it's been that way since the very beginning of A.A.  Bill Wilson started the A.A. tradition
of lying about the A.A. success rate, and it's never stopped.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Look here for much more on that</a>.
<p>
And even today, the official A.A. web site lies about the sobriety time of A.A. members.
They claim that the average sobriety time of A.A. members is 8 years. That is mathematically impossible
unless A.A. has very few newcomers.
But if you actually go to A.A. meetings, and look around, and find out how much sober time people
have, you will find that most people have under three years, and many have none.
No way do they all average out to 8 years.  A.A. lies. Period.

<p>
<li>
A.A. does not work at all. A.A. does not sober up alcoholics. All that A.A. has to offer is
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">a rehashed old pro-Nazi cult religion
from the nineteen-thirties</a>.

<p>
<li>
A.A. does more harm than good.
A.A. just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
and raises the rates of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">arrests</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">divorce</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">suicide</a>, while producing
a zero-percent improvement in the sobriety rate of alcoholics. That is not good.

<p>
<li>
I know why I am doing the Orange Papers web site. It's to tell the truth to the sick people
who need to know what works, and what doesn't, to save the lives of alcoholics and addicts.
Sick people deserve to be told the truth, not get some fraudulent quackery.
Lying to sick people about what might cure them, and how well the suggested cure works,
is a despicable crime.
<p>
I also do this web site to counteract the constant stream of lies and deceptions and propaganda
and promotion that comes out of A.A.
A.A. hypocritically claims to be a program of &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot;, but they constantly
promote and publicize A.A. in movies, TV shows, magazine articles, and anywhere else that they can,
and what they say about A.A., like the &quot;millions saved&quot; myth, is just untrue.
<p>
Even worse, A.A. promoters sell A.A. as a cure for alcohol abuse and
alcohol addiction. So-called &quot;treatment centers&quot; rake in many
billions of dollars per year by selling 12-Step quackery to sick people.
They should be put in prison for that.

<p>
<li>
The fact that A.A. fooled you into believing that A.A. saved your life is not evidence that
A.A. works great. It is just evidence that A.A. is good at indoctrinating and fooling a few people.
Read this forum thread for more on that:<br>


<p><li>
Lastly, you complain that I offer nothing. Wrong, totally wrong. I offer life  &#8212;  a free life without
either addictions or slavery to a cult. Look here for the details:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

</ol>
<p>
Now please do your homework, and learn the facts. Thank you.

Have a good day now.

Hi again Terrance,

<p>
No need to bother sending me links.  I am too impatient; if I'd just taken
the time to keep looking for them on your site before emailing you I would
have found them, which I since have.  You had plenty of them, and
accompanying research, already available on the site.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Charles. Hello again.
</font>
<p>
Your site is just a goldmine of information, I keep coming back to it even
when I feel like, enough already, Orange has said *more* than I needed to
hear to restore me to true sanity.  But you've posted so much to your site,
and have been so exhaustive in your research, I find myself continuing to
want to return for more.  The letters section has proved particularly
entertaining and enlightening.

<p>
It's been nearly a week since my last email to you.  At that point, a week
ago, I was thinking, alright, I will keep going to just one meeting a week
because I made a commitment to be a door greeter and I'm a man of my word
and I don't want to just back out on that.  (This despite the fact that the
six or so other people who had made the same commitment &#8212; it's a big Friday
meeting &#8212; stopped joining me as a greeter quite some time ago.)  In just
that short length of time since last week, however, I've become thoroughly
disgusted with myself for having been so easily duped, and I just don't see
how I can go to a single additional meeting.  I want to be respectful to the
people who were kind and supportive to me.  But I clearly can't keep going
to these meetings.  I feel no need to try to convince anyone else who does
go that they are &quot;wrong.&quot;  I'm not angry at them, or the organization, or
even myself, for having gone.  If other people get what they need from it,
G-d bless.  Not my business.  Although I am disappointed with myself for
having allowed myself to be fairly easily taken in.  I'm a highly educated
man, a successful lawyer, and pride myself on my powers of critical
analysis.  I pretty much chucked all of that overboard in the early going.
It feels good to be getting that back.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations, and welcome to freedom.
</font>
<p>
Part of me also believes that I should give myself a huge pass for having
acted in the way that I did in early sobriety.  Before my first AA meeting,
I was in pretty bad shape, drinking every day, and I had been in bad shape
for quite some time.  I know you know just how not fun that is.  I needed
help to get started down the path.  In all likelihood, any number of things
might have provided that initial shove that I needed, but AA was the only
thing that I was aware of at the time.  And there's no question that I
stumbled upon a really great group of well meaning people in the group that
I've been attending.  (I've since been to many other AA meetings, and there
are some that would have had me headed straight for the nearest bar had they
provided the only exposure I'd had to AA.)  I needed and wanted help to get
started.  They were very encouraging and supportive.  I am very grateful *to
those individuals* for that kindness and support.  But the nagging
inconsistencies and growing concern that a lot of what I was reading and
hearing was horse shit &#8212; which I consciously allowed myself to turn a blind
eye to early on, because I really just only wanted to NOT drink &#8212; would not
be denied.  And as I've regained my strength and my head has cleared and my
thinking becomes quite rational and very much something that I can trust,
thank you very much (except for the never ending and annoying heckling from
my Lizard Brain, which is truly full of shit), it's just not enough for me
that this particular group of people is well meaning and supportive.  They
all also believe in an agenda that I am simply not on board with and now
know that I will *never* be on board with for all of the myriad reasons that
you have so painstakingly outlined on your web site.  So, bottom line, I
will miss some of the acquaintances that I made in this group.  But that's
not enough to cause me to want to keep attending and supporting an
organization that I do not believe in.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Right. Don't be down on yourself for having believed their bull for a while. Everybody does,
including me.
<p>
The real question is, &quot;Will you be blind for life, or will the light bulb go on in your head?&quot;

</font>
<p>
Alright, I'm just rambling at this point.  I guess I needed to get all of
that off my chest.

<p>
In any event, I found the Oxford Group materials on your site on my own, so
I'm all good there.  I also found another book that I don't know if you've
referenced or not (although in light of how exhaustive you are, you probably
have), called The Oxford Group and Alcoholics Anonymous by Dick B.  He's a
true believer who *wants* to show the ties between AA and the Oxford Group,
so it's a very detailed &#8212; if not particularly artfully written &#8212; accounting
of that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yes. As a matter of fact, Dick B. sent me a bunch of his books several years ago,
to better educate me. Thanks, Dick.
<p>
I like Dick's historical research. But I have to disagree with his assumption that the
Oxford Group was a gift from God.

</font>
<p>
And again, I thank you for all of the time and effort you've expended on
creating and maintaining this site.  And apologies for accusing you of being
&quot;a bit over the top&quot; in my initial email.  A little zealousness in the
pursuit of truth is no vice.  Thank you in particular for two bits of advice
from your site that I am working on remaining very focused on:  First, don't
pick up a drink, genius.  Second, don't listen to your lizard brain when it
tells you that you can ignore rule #1 (no, you can't screw every pretty girl
you pass on the street even though your brain tells you that would be &quot;fun&quot;
to do, and no, you can't have a drink either.  You did have one.  You had a
good many more than just one.  And that didn't work out so well.  So stop
doing that.).  If I can remember those two things, and also remember that my
thinking is actually pretty good when I don't hand it over to someone else
or to some other group, I think I have a chance.  The fact that you now have
ten plus years of sobriety is very encouraging to me.

<p>
Rock on.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you've got it. And you would be surprised at how easy it is to rack up 10  &#8212;  now 11  &#8212; 
years of sobriety when you just always follow Rule Number 1.
It's impossible to drink too much or get into trouble with alcohol when you don't
take that first drink.

<p>
Another thing that you were hinting at was the realization that it's always a package deal.
That is, drinking comes with a lot of baggage, both positive and negative, and when you drink,
you get all of it. You can't pick and choose which things you will get.
You get both the fun and the unhappiness, the highs and the lows, both
the pleasure and the pain. Old Lizard Brain tries to convince us that we can get the pleasure
without the pain, the high without the crash, the intoxication without the damage,
the party without the expense.
<p>
But like you said, that didn't work out too good.
<p>

Thanks for the thanks, and you have a good day too.

Ducklings
</center>
Yes, these little guys have me figured out. They want the munchies that I bring.
<p>
These two ducklings are siblings, same mother, but different fathers. The duckling in front was fathered
by a drake that was mostly a domesticated black-and-white breed. The brown duckling in the rear was fathered
by a drake who was mostly Mallard. The domesticated ducks have orange bills and feet, and the Mallards have
dark brown or olive bills and feet. You can see how the duckling in back is half-and-half on his feet,
and the gosling in front has orange feet and touches of orange on his beak.
The mother was a gray-and-white duck of indeterminate domestic breed.
Almost all of the domestic ducks at the Fernhill Wetlands  &#8212;  that is, all
ducks except for the purely wild species like the Mallards and Pintails and Wood Ducks &#8212; 
are mongrels, some crazy mixture of domesticated breeds and Mallards.

Subject:  	A post on Stinkin Thinkin<br>

<p>
Terrance,

<p>
It's been a while since I have heard from you but I thought I would forward
this post I made on the blog Stinkin Thinkin regarding its closure
(http://goodbye.stinkin-thinkin.com/). I would be interested to hear your
views on what I have to say regardless of whether you decide to publish it
on the Orange Papers or not.

<p>
That aside, how are things? I am doing pretty well &#8212; I feel like I want to
get involved in this again having made genuine progress recently. I felt,
rightly or wrongly, that when I first challenged AA I might appear a bit of
a fraud as I had not been clean for any significant period of time. That is
not the case anymore.

<p>
Anyway it would be wonderful to hear your news.

<p>
Take care,

<p>
Jimmy

I see what you are saying about money, and how AA has used it to its
benefit. I think it is horses for courses  &#8212;  I have no issue with people
making money; hell without money we can't eat. I do, however, take offense
when people try to make money covertly. I believe in being transparent. It
is not for the sake of &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; but rather because a failure to be
so can come back to bite you further down the line. Personally I have chosen
not to make money from my anti AA work for the simple reason I do not need
the motivation of dollars to propel me  &#8212;  I have a very simple, and at times,
raw passion to expose AA for what it is. In terms of time and resources, I
am well out of pocket for the work I have done. That said, I have donated to
many sites online that challenge AA including Stinkin-Thinkin and the Orange
Papers. I did so because I wanted to support something I believe in. If I
had only been left with the choice to &quot;purchase&quot; something, I am not sure I
would have done so.

<p>
I think what needs to happen in order for this &quot;movement&quot;, or whatever we
call it, to be successful does not lie with the creation of wealth. AA is so
deep routed in society, including billion dollar industries, for example
treatment centres and even, to some extent, Hollywood, that fighting fire
with fire, if you like, is unlikely to be the answer.  In many respects AA
is not the only reason for this; where people see a problem, they look for a
solution and, for many, doing nothing is simply not an option. I think this
is where AA capitalises the most, at a time when people and their families
are most vulnerable. It offers a course of action, albeit an ineffective, if
not dangerous, one. Both AA members, and their families, feel that
participation in AA provides some sign of remorse and, crucially, the hope
that change is not too far away. Perhaps that is why I often do my utmost to
separate AA from society there by trying to show that it is not only AA, and
its members, that endorse its program, but also the wider public. Sometimes
I wonder whether we are attempting to persuade the wrong people of our very
genuine concerns.  Again, a good example of this is going after an AA member
that is guilty of a heinous crime  &#8212;  all it proves is that person is guilty
of a crime and that they have been to AA. For those in AA, and the public at
large, this is not going to be shocking, yet to us, including me, it is a
grave concern. (Why were they sent to AA in the first place? Who sent them?
And who continues to advise AA to people when criminals are sent there too?)

<p>
On the other hand, if we could prove beyond reasonable doubt that exposure
to Step One, ie powerlessness, leads to say, binge drinking, I think we'd
be onto a winner.<br>
(*&quot;The first step leads to low self-esteem, learned
helplessness, personal irresponsibility, and binge drinking. The first step
is a step toward disaster; it has no redeeming features.&quot; (Bufe, 1998)<br>

<p>
Even a small
victory like getting AA to advise newcomers that AA is not the only way, or
of more urgency, warning the newcomer of sexual predators, would be a huge
step in the right direction. I don't think we will destroy AA by making its
destruction our *modus operandi* . However, we can, slowly but surely,
strive to educate people on what is wrong with the program. To make money
from this, someone would have to offer an alternative, yet many of us do not
even regard addiction per se as an illness, or a problem in and of itself.
Addiction is a secondary condition that masks primary issues, in my eyes,
which I add for the sake of clarity.

<p>
The most powerful thing we can do is unite in our actions. That is why I
make a point of linking other sites wherever I can, in my videos, on my
website, etc. I have felt of late that we, and in particular Mike (we are
separate people by the way ;) ), are not that popular on Stinkin Thinkin. Of
course this saddens me somewhat, but I suspect this is because we challenge
people on both sides of the fence. (I only got involved in this 6 years ago
because I set out to prove Orange wrong and ended up proving him right!) I
know how to maximise hits et al., but, ultimately, how does that help our
cause, especially if all those hits come from the already converted?
Further, and perhaps of more importance, if we are to succeed we need to
engage anyone that is willing to challenge the program, regardless of their
intensity and anger, or lack thereof, towards it.

<p>
Some might argue that this is contrived, but I do not see it that way. I'll
agree with points that I agree with, regardless of anything. If an AA member
contacts me on Youtube and says they are appalled by the manner in which AA
subtly claims to be the only way, I'll engage with them.  Similarly, if a
member writes to me expressing concern for a vulnerable newcomer, of course
I am going to reply. Not all members of AA are terrible people, just as we
are not all dry drunks, whatever the hell that means.

<p>
Finally, many of us, if not the majority, were once in AA. This is a
critical point for me [us] to remember because having been members, somehow
we reached the decision to leave. If we can tap into those reasons, we'd not
only reach people like us, but also many of the people on the periphery
around them.  First and foremost, it is important to speak our individual
truths; don't get me wrong, but as so many on this blog have expressed a
desire for us to become more effective, I felt driven to offer my views on
how we might achieve that.

Hi Jimmy,
<p>
Thanks for all you do.
<p>
I see three prongs of attack on A.A.:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Inform the public about the true nature of A.A.
<li> Stop the inflow of money. This means discrediting the treatment centers, and invalidating the
copyrights that AAWS holds over foreign countries. This also includes cutting off the funding
that comes from government programs (city, state, and Federal) that fund treatment of alcoholics
and addicts.

<li> Stop sentencing people to A.A. This includes judges, parole officers, and &quot;treatment counselors&quot;
and &quot;therapists&quot; sending people to A.A.
</ol>

<p>
Here we are in election season again. Politicians are more prone to listening to people now that
their seats are at stake. This is a good time to be informing the politicians about A.A. and
how it is a fraud.
<p>
And personally, I think the treatment centers should be prosecuted for fraud and practicing medicine
without a license.
They take anything from $7000 to $40,000 from sick, desperate people,
and all that they give is 28 days of indoctrination in
an old cult religion? And they call that treatment?

<p>
Have a good day now.
