Orange,

<p>
Your far right stance on aa implies you might have some koolaid for your followers
to drink.
<p>
I am sure there will be some fatalities.  Funny how it is so easy to ignore years of
evidence
and volumes of research and then to gather such trite info so as to twist the real
truth.  I propose you do experiments onyourself &amp; loved ones.  A double blinded
study within the family where there is an aa control group and a egomaniac drunkard
group.  Runthe studyfor 12 years  &amp; let me know how functional your family is.  I
can predict the fall out &amp; deaths.
<p>
What are you smoking?   Prove something better.   Lots of bad info born out of anger
perhaps?

Hello Dan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Those Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies have already been done, and the results were that
A.A. failed badly. I described how you do such a clinical study here:
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>.
<p>
The results of the tests were:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a> found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics. People who were sent to
A.A. ended up, after 9 months of A.A., doing FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got no such help, and NINE TIMES as much
binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for public drunkenness
in a group of street drunks.
<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a> that
&quot;free&quot; A.A.  just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
make them need more expensive hospitalization later.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
Doctors Orford and Edwards conducted the largest and most expensive test of A.A. in England</a>.
They found that having a doctor talk to alcoholics and their wives for only one hour, only one time,
telling them to quit drinking or they would die,
was just as effective as a whole year of A.A.-based treatment.

<p>
<li>
This one is the most damning evidence of all, because it came from a doctor
who loves Alcoholics Anonymous, and is one of its biggest promoters.
He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous [World]
Services, Inc..
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>
(who later became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
while he tried to prove that A.A. works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based treatment
program had a zero-percent success rate above
normal spontaneous remission, and worse, it had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
At the end of 8 years, the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients
was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
</ol>


<p>
It is not possible to do a &quot;double blind&quot; test of Alcoholics Anonymous. What that term means is that
neither the patient nor the doctor knows whether the patients are getting the real medicine or a placebo.
(Another doctor or a pharmacist who won't talk puts the pills in the bottles, and only he knows who is
getting what. That eliminates the power of suggestion from the test results.)
Someone would have to be both blind and deaf to not know whether he was going to A.A. meetings.
If he was, how is he supposed to hear the drunkalogues?
<p>
I know that there are a few flattering remarks about A.A. on the NIDA
and SAMSHA web sites. The A.A. promoters never sleep, and never fail to
get a plug in there for their favorite cult religion.
I also know that the current attitude of the NIH is to demand
results. They are demanding more and more evidence-based methods.
A high-ranking official of the NIAAA &#8212; Mark Willenbring, director of treatment and
recovery research at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism &#8212; recently
declared that Alcoholics Anonymous teachings about alcoholism
were &quot;inconsistent with the evidence&quot;.

Hi Orange,
<p>
I thought you might enjoy this website with all of the May 21 Judgment Day hoopla
going around right now. It's amazing what people have and continue to believe. I
have not researched the organization promoting the most recent date of May 21, but I
suspect they are a cult as well.

Hello again, Lisa,
<p>
Yes, isn't that a laugh?
<p>
What is even funnier is that more than a month ago, a friend came over and invited me to a Judgement Day
barbeque. According to the <i>Terminator</i> movies, April 21, 2011 was &quot;Judgement Day&quot; when the Skynet
super-computers took over the world. So they planned to watch <i>Terminator</i>
movies and munch hamburgers and watch Skynet take over the world.

<p>
Then, on the radio the next day, I heard that
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005251/http://Familyradio.com/" target="_blank">Familyradio.com</a>
was saying that May 21, 2011 was the end of the world. Wow. Exactly one month later.

<p>
But that cannot really be correct, because the Jehovah's Witnesses told
us that the world is going to end in 1975, and only 144,000 believers
are going to get into Heaven.
<p>
I guess we didn't make it.

Oh well, better luck in the next lifetime.

Subject:  	If Only,If Only<br>

<p>
For years and years I have begged Mr. Orange to quit being a pissed off grumpy,
egotitical, angry asshole.
<p>
I,too, am highly educated about Alcoholic's Anonymous and have read every word
Terrance has written.
<p>
I also very much agree with about 98-99% of the posted information on this site.
I feel strongly that Alcoholic's Anonymous, without meaning to, actually lenghtens a
person's alcoholic nightmare when the malady could be put to rest at early stages
of alcoholism.
<p>
I do not think that A.A. was started as a evil cult nor do I think AA initself has a
purposeful agenda to fuck over  the suffering alcoholic.  But AA simply does not
work.  I  have recently traveled 22 states and attended hundreds of AA meetings with
a very watchful eye.  Some very nice sincere folks, but tons of old men with nothing
better to do  than to try and hit on women members with their long term wisdom
status of sobriety.  Most of these types have no where else to go, and at these
meetings they feel they have a God given purpose.  If AA would not have gotten
involved in the court system, which semi-forces people into the program, I would not
be so appalled.
<p>
My problem with agent orange is that I think he is doing a fine recruiting job for
AA with all his anger and hostilities and unsettled psycholical problems.  Charlie
Sheen has strenghtened AA with his rants of the 5% success rate too.
<p>
I have begged Mr. Orange  ( who I think has his heart in a good place and is
probably a nice person) to try and attempt to stop being a asshole.  I have failed
and hope the number of people Terry recruits into AA is minimal.  I do believe that
AA is dangerous for many, many desperate alcoholic's seeking help.  Agent Orange
could be a well known authority on the dangers of AA via the news media, press and
television, but he just cannot stop from being the insultive angry manic hippy
asshole.  I wonder how many people read his site and then attend a AA meeting and
see how things are not quite as drastic as he illustrates.  I sure hope I am
mistaken on this.  I really do.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
It never ceases to amaze me how people can think that if you are angry at criminals hurting sick people,
there is something wrong with you. &quot;Having a resentment&quot; is not &quot;axiomatically spiritually wrong.&quot;

<p>
I seriously doubt that my attitude recruits people for Alcoholics Anonymous.
Heck, I don't think even Charlie Sheen's antics
and craziness recruit for A.A. I think judges and &quot;counselors&quot; who send people to A.A. are far more
effective at A.A. recruiting.
<p>
Oh, and I know that A.A. really did start as an evil cult:

From:  	&quot;Jason&quot;<br>
Subject:  	My own AA experience . . . what else?<br>

<p>
I haven't been to an AA meeting in about two months, and even before then I had only
been in the program since last November.  But it has taken me that long to muster up
the courage to finally google the phrase &quot;Is AA a cult?&quot;  Boy, am I glad I did.  I
was feeling kind of guilty about disappearing from the program and blowing off my
sponsor (actually he blew me off once I stopped going to meetings), but after
reading through the orange papers, I feel more relief than guilt.

<p>
I found myself thrust into AA through a military treatment program called SARP (I am
former Navy).  After my first and only alcohol related incident involving the
military, still drunk, I broke down to my command chaplain; a Lutheran minister who
I had always trusted and an O-5 (commander) by rank.  To my surprise, he told me
that he too had struggled with alcohol problems in the past, and had been something
like 20 years sober thanks to a wonderful program called Alcoholics Anonymous.  I
automatically thought to myself, &quot;now here's a man who cares; who will obviously
stick up for me.&quot;  WRONG.  The next thing out of his mouth was a slew of insults
aimed at making me believe how stupid and evil I was.  He called me a liar,
manipulator, and pointed out how screwed up I was in the head because I was an
alcoholic.  A minister of all people!  I was so devastated, I immediately just put
it out of my mind.

<p>
Well, about a month later, I found myself in mandatory treatment.  The SARP facility
wasn't all that bad.  The counselors seemed nice, and the group therapy was actually
quite helpful.  Part of the treatment program, however, was attending an AA or NA
meeting every evening by government shuttle.  My &quot;nice&quot; counselors, I would later
find out, were all die hard AA-ers themselves.  I thought I might have a problem
because I liked getting drunk just for the sake of getting drunk (who in the Navy
doesn't?), but I didn't think I was an alcoholic.  Well, after about two meetings, I
was already admitting that I was.  It just seemed like the thing to do in order to
fit in.  Not to mention, I was practically barred from the outside world at this
point, and these meetings were my only taste of freedom while in treatment on a Navy
base.  Naturally, it all seemed very appealing.

<p>
While in treatment, I got a sponsor; not an old timer, but a name I had heard
mentioned repeatedly around the meeting rooms.  Obviously, anyone who was going to
sponsor me had to be well known.  He seemed like a really good guy, and it sounded
like we had a whole bunch in common.  Even after I got out of treatment (28 days
later), I kept going to meetings, got my 30 day chip, and still called my sponsor
every day.  I had no trouble with the first three steps as I was raised
Presbyterian, never really had a crisis of faith, and am happy with being just
that.  But when it came to the fourth step . . . let's just say I didn't really get
it.  Not only did it take up a huge amount of my time, but I also just couldn't
comprehend how writing down all of these resentments that I honestly didn't even
feel I had could be beneficial in any way, shape, or form.  I kept asking my sponsor
how detailed I should get with my list, yet never got a straight
answer.  No, it was always, &quot;Read the Big Book!&quot;  In fact, any question I ever had,
it seemed like the answer was always somewhere hidden on the same 2 pages of the
Big Book that my sponsor just had me read over and over again.  He had me highlight
things that meant nothing to me, but through some sort of twisted logic made
perfect sense to him.  But of course I wouldn't understand, right?  I am alcoholic,
and can't think for myself . . . or so I was told.

<p>
Well, need I say that it wasn't very long after my first relapse when I started
observing strange behavior in members of the group.  I noticed that people who once
thought I was the coolest thing at any meeting wouldn't even come over and say hi
anymore.  And those who would acted very awkward in my presence.  My sponsor began
telling me that I wasn't ready to embrace the program yet because I still wanted to
do it on my own.  Then he started asking me for money.  It was then that I began to
look and listen even more at the craziness that I was embedded in.  For example, my
sponsor and I were out to lunch one day.  We asked for separate checks as was the
norm, and both of his credit cards got declined.  Well, he spent a good ten to
fifteen minutes kind of muttering incoherent gibberish under his breath while
checking his bank account over his phone, and then just busted out in a freakish
laugh about how he didn't take his meds that day.  I have
to admit I was kind of scared.  So I offered to pay for his lunch so we could just
get the hell out of there and call it day.  Turns out, the dude had nowhere near
the amount of success that he claimed AA had given him.  Not only was he living on
a check from the government every month, but was practically homeless, kicking
around at his mother's every once in a while (I never really figured out where his
permanent address was).  He even tried encouraging me to learn how to cook so that
he could come over for dinner at my place.

<p>
Other AA members, likewise, began giving me the creeps.  People whom I had heard
speak up during meetings. thinking they were oh so wise, turned out to be blithering
crackpots one on one.  I'm talking about the kind of random thoughts being handed
out on leaflets in pre-Giuliani Times Square about international Jewish banking
conspiracies, John Lennon's death, and Princess Grace sightings.  On a more specific
occasion, I received a text message from a female AA-er telling me that it was about
time she and I had sex with one another. . . shortly after I had found out that she
had beaten the crap out of her boyfriend's car with a baseball bat.  Then there were
the meetings after the meetings where we would go out the dinner or something, and
the incessant talk about being an alcoholic.  I wish I had a dollar for every time I
heard someone say, &quot;we are not a glum lot&quot; after some extended laughter session over
nothing.  Yes, these people were sick
alright, and I was beginning to feel like maybe I didn't really want what they
wanted after all.

<p>
So I stopped going to meetings and stopped calling my sponsor.  I honestly haven't
heard from him since.  I continued to abstain from alcohol for the next couple of
weeks, but then one night while I was out to dinner with a client, I ordered a
cocktail . . . just one . . . and just one is all I had.  The second night out, I
ordered a cocktail . . . again, just one was all I had.  The third night out, I
ordered a Coca-Cola and left it at that.  Whoa!  Perhaps I can control my drinking!
What a concept, right?  Since then, I have been having one drink with dinner at
most, and am getting along just fine.  My roommates threw a party with 25 &#8212; 30
guests and a female stripper the other night, and I only had three drinks over the
course of the whole evening.  My friends have told me how proud they are of me, and
how they are even prouder that I am able to control my drinking on my own in social
situations (drinking alone wasn't a problem because I
never did it anyway) instead of compulsively going to meetings all the time with
strangers who were trying to change me completely.

<p>
Which brings me, orange, to my final point.  I didn't really catch a whole lot of
this on your website, but perhaps I missed it.  While I was attending AA, I received
a lot of pressure to ditch my old friends and pursue new friendships within AA
(which I never really did because I thought most of them were losers anyway).  This
was especially brought up time and time again by my sponsor.  What can I say?  I've
always been a fairly popular guy.  I told my sponsor that there was no way AA could
ever socially compare with my old time circle of friends.  &quot;But these are the
people,&quot; he told me, &quot;who will tempt you to drink again.&quot;  I heard this preached in
meetings all the time that members who have stuck with AA eventually disassociate
themselves with their old friends in favor of other members of the cult.  This, I
think, terrified me most of all towards the end.  If I had to give up my old friends
in favor of these lunatics, then yeah, I could
probably see myself succumbing to their brainwashing even more so.  But that was
where I drew the line.  And incidentally, might I add, throughout all of this not
one of my old friends . . . not even the heaviest drinkers among them . . . ever
once encouraged me to take a drink.  I received such support from these guys that
some of them even refused to drink around me at all.

<p>
Well, that concludes my dreadful experience.  All in all, looking back on it, it was
all quite surreal.  I hope you found it helpful.  And as they say in AA . . . Thanks
for letting me share!  Oh God, did I really just say that?  Just kidding.

<p>
Sincerely yours,

<p>
Jason D.

12-Step programs. Meaning: <b>you can sue a judge, a prison warden, a parole officer,
a &quot;counselor&quot;, or anyone else in a position of authority who
forces you to go to A.A. meetings</b>.
<p>
Then you encountered a bunch of the standard cult characteristics like:
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong">2. You are always wrong.</a>
The way that the preacher put you down was heartless. And also just plain wrong.
He is one brainwashed cult member who sees everything through the tinted
lenses of the cult.
<p>
That, in turn, leads to the corrollary:

<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_guru_right">1. The Guru is always right.</a>
The sacred words of the Holy Prophet Bill Wilson, as written down in the <i>Big Book</i>, are always right,
and cannot be questioned, only worshipped.

<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak">5. Cult-speak.</a>
All of their words have special meanings, which you won't understand
until you become one of the holy old-timers.

<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality">7. Irrationality.</a>
The teachings are crazy.

<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers">42. Disturbed Members, Mentally Ill Followers.</a>
 They are all stoned crazy.

<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_powerlessness">43. Create a sense of powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.</a>
&quot;You are powerless over alcohol and you will die without wonderful A.A.&quot;

<p><li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_tinted_lenses">83. Seeing Through Tinted Lenses</a>. Your preacher and sponsor and the other true believers see the whole world through the filter of the cult's dogma.
Like drinking too much a few times automatically means that you are obviously
selfish, manipulative, evil, and unspiritual. (Yes, they are stoned crazy.)

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers">90. Newcomers Need Fixing.</a> This one is pretty obvious.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_newcomers_wrong">33. Newcomers can't think right.</a>
Yes, &quot;your best thinking got you here. So just let your sponsor do your thinking for you.&quot;

</ul>

<p>
Then, the way that they wanted you to stop associating with your old friends who are not A.A.
members is classic cult behavior. I hear of that one often.
They didn't want you associating with any non-members who might contradict the A.A. nonsense and
talk a little common sense into you.
They rationalized their behavior by arguing that non-members are a threat to your sobriety.

<p>
Scientology does the same thing too, you know. At a certain point in a Scientologist's training, he
is informed that he must cut all ties with non-Scientologists, including parents, spouses,
siblings, old friends, everybody. Those other people must either join Scientology or else they get
black-listed and ostracized. Scientology argues that those non-Scientologists are insane
and mentally defective and unethical and will infect the new Scientologists with bad thoughts.
<p>
That is really very common cult behavior, and it's listed in the Cult Test.
Here are some relevant items, first the Cult Test questions, and then the answers for A.A.:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_total_immersion" target="_blank">99. Total immersion and total isolation.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_own_you" target="_blank">86. The cult wants to own you.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_enemy" target="_blank">85. Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_scapegoating" target="_blank">78. Scapegoating and Excommunication</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">12. The cult and its members are special.</a>
</ul>
<p>
And the answers for A.A.:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_total_immersion" target="_blank">99. Total immersion and total isolation.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_own_you" target="_blank">86. The cult wants to own you.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_enemy" target="_blank">85. Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_scapegoating" target="_blank">78. Scapegoating and Excommunication</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special" target="_blank">12. The cult and its members are special.</a>
</ul>
<p>
Lastly, it is entirely possible that you are not an alcoholic and never were.
Lots and lots of people tie one on now and then. Most everybody who drinks
has had a few experiences of getting really blasted on a few occasions.
That is what you call being human.
<p>
There are also lots of people who drank too much in their youth, and then just matured out of it.
That isn't &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
<p>
What I call an alcoholic is somebody like me who cannot moderate his drinking at all.
One drink leads to six which leads to a case or a fifth, real fast.
And then it becomes my lifestyle and I'm drinking too much every day, until the doctor
tells me to quit drinking or I'm going to die.
I can either totally abstain from alcohol, or I can drink myself to death,
but there is no inbetween. I tried for 20 years to keep it down to a dull roar,
and it didn't work. So I just don't drink at all.
<p>
Note that I can still control my drinking &#8212; by not drinking a single drop. I just don't seem to
be able to control my drinking after I get three or four drinks in me.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous actually uses several different definitions of the
word &quot;alcoholic&quot;, and mixes them up, which really confuses the issue.
<a href="orange-letters126.html#definitions" target="newwin140">See the definitions here</a>.
An alcoholic might be somebody who drinks too much, or an alcoholic might be someone who is
hyper-sensitive to alcohol, or an alcohol might be a selfish, manipulative sinner.
So when A.A. insists that you must call yourself an alcoholic, they aren't even being clear
about just what an alcoholic is.
<p>
Gee, you say that you have a problem with drinking more than you intended, and the next thing
you know, they are telling you that you are a sinner, selfish, manipulative, a liar who
is in denial, and you have gotten too far away from God.
<p>
Oh well, I'm glad that you left that behind. Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Trish R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	&quot;Housing First&quot; tempest reported in Portland Tribune<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
Sorry in advance this is so long...

<p>
I don't know if you've seen the May 12, 2011 Portland Tribune [still available
on the steet til this coming Thursday].  There's a front page story &quot;Homeless
and Addicted: On the streets or off?&quot;, that I thought you might find
interesting.  Apparantly, the policy in Portland's subsidized housing for the
past few years has been that they no longer demand abstinence pledges from
anyone who goes from homlessness to subsidized housing.  People identifying
themselves as &quot;advocates&quot; for alcoholics/addicts people paid to enroll people,
I'm assuming primarily homeless, into alcohol/drug treatment] complained
about this policy &#8212; one says he's &quot;given up on Portland's public housing as a
way to help the mentally ill and addicted&quot; [sheltering them isn't help?] and
another claims &quot;I'm not against this kind of housing, but what we're really
lacking is capacity for people who want to enter recovery and significantly
change their lives.&quot; [are they forbidden to NOT drink in these units?]  Another
says &quot;persons currently abusing illegal drugs and abusing alcohol get a
preference over persons coming out of an alcohol and drug treatment program or
stepping down from a mental health treatment center.&quot; [If they don't forbid an
activity, can they ban people who don't do the activity?  Really?]

<p>
I might be hopelessly naive, but I would think an advocate on behalf of a group
of people would be glad for any help for the persons they claim to advocate for,
however piecemeal that help.  And, unless the subsidized housing units literally
require tenants to chug like frat pledges  &#8212; and that the policy is just that
drinking isn't verboten &#8212; a person's having just left treatment
shouldn't influence their eligibility for a subsidized unit.  Also, unless the
goal of the Recovery Movement is getting all alcohol out of America, the fact is
that every person entering recovery will, sooner or later, have to face the fact
that they live in a world where other people will consume alcohol and drugs [and
in law-abiding ways, like prescriptions for chronic pain or the occasional visit
to Amsterdam].

<p>
I also have to wonder what sorts of &quot;help&quot; or &quot;techniques&quot; treatment/recovery
actually give to their clients to improve their ability to live in a real world
where there will be people choosing to drink [who aren't ruining their lives],
people who don't drink &amp; aren't in AA &amp; aren't mean ole &quot;dry drunks&quot;, and where
wine &amp; beer are in supermarket aisles.  Seriously, if people who are freshly in
their &quot;recovery &#8212; having just made the decision to quit, attending meetings, and
experiencing the powerful social influence of being welcomed into a group of
people with the same stated goal &#8212; if people whose &quot;recovery&quot; is being so
reinforced by such powerful influences on humans are living in a state of
abstinence that is so fragile that the idea that someone else in the building
wouldn't be thrown out for enjoying a beer [either quietly in their own room or
in some restaurant or bar during their tenancy], I just don't see what use these
&quot;treatment&quot; programs are, either for the individual or for society.

<p>
I also have to ask, why would it even be an issue for treatment program
recruiters whether subsidized housing requires all tenants ot refrain from all
alcohol [and drugs].  If the treatment offered is the same, whether the client
is homeless or has a place to live &#8212; and the latter are more likely than not to
live in apartment building or neighborhood in which other residents are lawfully
imbibing some amounts of alcohol &#8212; wouldn't it be better for the physical health
of an individual embarking on quitting alcohol or drugs to have a warm, stable
place to live?  Subsidized housing units for homeless people are about getting
people who don't have homes a stable place to live.  Not every person who lacks
housing is necessarily a candidate for alcohol/drug treatment, and it seems to
me that treating all of them like they can't handle their liquor is not
justified or fair.  I also have to question whether someone who has decided for
whatever reason to quit alcohol believing that they should turn down subsidized
housing because of what other tenants may or may not do [especially in the
context of a legal activity like drinking alcohol] might have been brainwashed
into doing something that isn't in their best interest.

<p>
According to the Tribune, this article was 2nd in a series, but using their
search engine &amp; &quot;browse archives&quot; I couldn't find the first article in the
series [maybe when I get a chance to mosey to a brink &amp; morter library in the
next couple of days I can find a paper copy...]

<p>
Another thing I find alarming, as I think about this article, is how the
alcohol/drug addiction industrial complex has glommed on to the mentally ill &#8212; 
as in &quot;Mental illness/addiction&quot; specialist [or counselor or activist].  While
I'm sure some mentally ill people might have issues that in some way involve
alcohol [self-medicating with alcohol instead of seeing a doctor, alcohol
interacting with medications &#8212; or being labelled an alcoholic/addict when their
real problem is schizophrenia, or bipolar or depression], how much overlap is
there, really in what mentally ill persons need, as opposed to people who want
to quit alcohol/drugs?  I mean, schizophrenics can decide to quit drinking
booze, but they can't decide to stop hearing voices. If they decide to stop
meds, their voices &amp; delusions can't be controlled by an act of will.   Whereas
even someone who has overimbibed so much alcohol that they've developed
cirrhosis or even brain damage can still decide to quit drinking [and according
to the studies your site quotes, probably has a better chance of succeeding even
at that late state without some sort of treatment/rehab/recovery.  Even a person
with as constricted an intellect as GW Bush managed to quit without &quot;working
steps&quot; going to meetings or sleeping in a $35,000 a month rehab bed.

<p>
Another thing I heard recently that made me question the whole concept of
&quot;addictions&quot;: I saw a former FBI profiler on TV, who actually said that a serial
killer was &quot;addicted&quot; to killing people.  It's starting to seem like any
activity that a human might enjoy, however harmeless [sugary breakfast cereal]
or antisocial [killing people one has never met] is being classified as a
&quot;disease.&quot;  Like, maybe human existence is just a collection of different
versions of the same &quot;disease.&quot;  This is probably a great way to expand the
market for something that a lot of people are really willing to sell....

<p>
I worry about these issues as a citizen, and a taxpayer, in a time when our
country can't even come to an agreement that providing medical care to citizens
suffering even physical ailments beyond the control of their own behavior [birth
defects, infectious diseases, accidents, diseases of ageing].   And when we do
talk about concepts like universal health insurance [basically buying health
care we can predict citizens will need for a better price via economies of
scale, and maybe agreeing it isn't fair that 85% of the bankruptsies in the U.S.
are triggered by medical bills for illnesses for which the party was insured at
the time they developed the illness].  But, because of the fact that there are
people who are salaried &quot;mental health/addiction&quot;
specialists/activists/counselors/advocates lobbying for &quot;mental health parity&quot;
bills that would include requiring health insurance to cover costs of sleepover
rehab to the same extent they cover, say, cancer surgery/chemo, I worry that the
moment we do get some form of single payer system [whether national or
state-by-state], there still won't be sufficient funds to cover physical and
mental health treatments because they won't be able to say no to people who
think that they have a disease that can only be treated by hanging out in a
group of people who've been forbidden to read anything but the ramblings of
BillW &amp; maybe a bible, and not going to work.  I don't think it would be at all
unfair for a national health program to require scientific evidence that the
alleged &quot;illness&quot; that someone wants payment to treat actually exists &#8212; and by
scientific evidence, I mean an actual lab test that distinguishes with a
reasonable level of accuracy, who does and does not have the disease, not
counting how many people are willing to say &quot;I know this is a disease&quot;.  And,
before our tax dollars pay for a treatment, it would be fair to require
scientifically reputable evidence that the treatment actually works better than
chance, doing nothing, or placebo.

<p>
Sorry for the long rant, but the Trib only takes letters to the editor under 250
words and the above-mentioned  article was just such a juicy topic for
dissection...

Hi Trish,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and you don't have to apologize for the length. It is not a problem. Fortunately,
we don't have to pay for blank paper here.
<p>
As you probably know, I went through that same Portland, Oregon, housing program when I quit drinking
ten years ago. I saw all of the problems that you talk about.
<p>
I had a relatively easy time of it. I had gotten so sick that when my
doctor said, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;, I believed him.
It was obvious that I was dying, and I knew it.
After thinking it over for a while, I decided to live. So I quit drinking.
I quit two weeks before
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">my so-called &quot;treatment program&quot;</a>
started.
<p>
At that time, the deal with housing was that you had to be 100% clean and sober. If you relapsed,
meaning, showed up drunk or stoned even once (which is not really a &quot;relapse&quot;), you had one hour
to gather up your belongings and hit the street. Any possessions that you left behind would get bagged
and tagged and stored for a month, and then thrown out in the trash. 
I saw a lot of people's possessions bagged.

<p>
What bothered me about all of that was that the people who needed help the most got the least.

Somebody like me who could get a grip and change his behavior got the best of everything.
People who were really sick and out of control, even mentally ill,
got kicked out on the streets and cut off from any help.
They were just homeless again.
And if they had been in some kind of a program, they invariably quit the program when they
were kicked out onto the streets.
Proving: If you want them in &quot;treatment&quot;, the best way to keep them in treatment
is to keep them in housing.

<p>
One of the big problems with Portland's programs at that time was that they had two conflicting
goals:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Get the homeless people off of the streets.
<p><li> Get the alcoholics and drug addicts to be clean and sober.
</ol>

<p>
When they made being 100% clean and sober a condition of getting housing, they guaranteed that
the sickest people would be back on the streets very soon.
They guaranteed that the hard-core addicts would not get into housing.
In fact, I knew one junkie who would not even apply for housing or try to start any program.
He knew the routine, and knew that it would never work out.
The last time I saw him, he was still homeless and has been for all of the 10 years that I've
been sober.

<p>
Some time ago, somebody published an article about the &quot;One-hundred Thousand Dollar Man&quot;.
I seem to recall that it was about housing the homeless alcoholics in Seattle.
The title was a bit of a spoof on the old TV series &quot;The Million-Dollar Man&quot;, but the
subject was serious: Some sick homeless people manage to wrack up nearly $100,000 in medical
costs by repeatedly almost dying on the streets. An ambulance is called and they get taken
to the hospital and treated and put back together enough to be released, and then the alcoholics
and addicts repeat the cycle again and again, until some nearly become $100,000 men.
That name is only a slight exaggeration. The article mentioned some old alcoholics who
had wracked up $60,000 or $70,000 in medical costs.
<p>
Well, Seattle decided that it would be much cheaper to give them housing and let them drink
in their SRO rooms. The Puritans screamed, of course, and said that Seattle was catering to
alcoholics, and making it too easy to be an alcoholic.
They made sarcastic remarks about &quot;The Alky Hilton&quot; and &quot;free alky hotels&quot;.
<p>
And there we again see the conflict: Is the goal to get the alcoholics and addicts off of the streets,
or is the goal to force them to quit drinking and drugging?
Experience teaches us that we can't have it both ways.

<p>
About some of your other points: I never felt like having people around me who were sneaking
a drink was any threat to me or my sobriety. And yes, I knew about some of that happening.
I just decided for myself that I was not going to drink any more, no matter what other
people chose to do with their lives. So I don't buy the argument that having a drinker
in the housing threatens the sobriety of all of the other people.
<p>
Now if they were having a block party with kegs lined up, that might get tempting to a lot of
alcoholics, but that wasn't what was going on. Well, except for the Waterfont Blues Festival,
which is exactly what was going on. Still, I went to that party nine years in a row and never
drank.
<p>
Obviously, it is not possible to remove all temptation. Anybody who decides to quit drinking
is just going to be surrounded by people who still drink. Welcome to reality.

<p>
If somebody is really going to quit drinking, they have to just really
quit drinking, even though they are surrounded by alcohol.
Which they always are. When you quit drinking, you suddenly become acutely aware of just
how many bars there are on the street.

<p>
I agree that it is both unfair and stupid to treat all homeless people like they are alcoholics
or addicts. In fact, there is every reason to believe that the majority of the homeless people
actually have untreated mental illnesses that they are trying to fix by self-medicating.

<p>
Speaking of which, I never saw a single counselor or mentor or supervisor
who was qualified to treat mentally ill people. Not one. Not ever. Not even close.
Almost all of the &quot;counselors&quot; and &quot;managers&quot; that
I saw were just former alcoholics or addicts who had allegedly gotten
a few years clean and sober and also joined the 12-Step cult.
Even though a few of them were nice people, none were qualified to treat anything.
Heck, my main &quot;counselor&quot; was
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="_blank">a cocaine-snorting Internet child porn freak who went to
prison for criminal sexual penetration of his own step-children</a>.

So much for &quot;the program&quot;. And so much for his &quot;counseling&quot;.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that Portland is coming to its senses and realizing that if it wants to
get the homeless people off of the streets, that it has to make that goal unconditional.
It can't demand that the homeless people also become tea-totalers. That just never worked.

<p>
I'll also see if I can find those articles. That will be some interesting reading.
<p>
Oh, and lastly, I totally agree that labeling everything a disease is flat-out crazy.
Stanton Peele wrote a book called &quot;The Diseasing of America&quot; that criticized such nonsense.
Not every unpleasant thing is a disease. But there is really a plot afoot to call more
and more things &quot;a disease&quot; because then somebody can make money treating it.
<p>
My favorite non-disease is
&quot;<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="_blank">Codependency</a>&quot;,
which is a strange spiritual or psychological malady that
is caused by the spiritual cooties that you get from rubbing against an alcoholic.
You can pay a fortune to get your Codependency treated,
and you can even get expensive in-patient treatment. And the treatment
is an introduction to A.A.'s 12 Steps.  And some health insurance companies
were crazy enough to actually pay for it.

<p>
Both the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have recently
expanded their definitions of &quot;disease&quot; or &quot;illness&quot; or &quot;addiction&quot; to
allow charging health insurance for treating more conditions.
Of course such shenanigans will bankrupt the health care system.
The system will just have to stop treating some people or some conditions.
We really will end up with death panels that decide who will live and who will die.
(Actually, we already have such panels. They are part of the health insurance companies. It will get worse.)

<p>
Have a good day now.

Thanks Terrence (Orange) for offering to download the pictures in a  more
printable version. The most recent letters you posted last week has  the
picture of the mallard sort of from behind with him reaching towards his
back.....that is the one that caught my eye, although ANY of them make for a
beautiful framed portrait.

I am a duck lover too.... we have a little place in Michigan that  our
family has had for years..... I have been watching the ducks all of my life  and
have in the past made some vain attempts at photographing them to hang in
our cottage. Needless to say I have an inadequate camera, and an even worse
knack for photography....so your pictures would be a wonderful addition to
our  little family cabin in the woods by the lake....

Hi again, Renee,
<p>
Okay, here you go. What you are seeing on the screen now is the low-resolution versions of
these pictures. But if you click on the pictures, you will get the hi-res version in a new
window (or tab, depending on how your preferences are set). Then you can save that large version
to disk, and print it. These versions of the pictures have been cropped, but not scaled down.
The original pictures were landscape orientation, 4x3, wider than tall. I cropped off the extra
sand and rocks on the left and right, so they now have a portrait orientation.

By the way, these two were a mated pair. And they are both very good-looking ducks.
They came over to see what munchies they could get
from me, and hung around for a while to see what else I might have in my bag.
<p>
That's one of the reasons for my success in getting some great shots  &#8212;  just feed the ducks and
geese all of the time, and eventually you become just one of the flock, and they will
hang out around you as if you aren't even there.
<p>
Or the kids will mob you and grab the bread out of your hands before you even offer it.
They know why you are there and who the bread is for.
Then the problem gets to be focusing on them. I put a telephoto lens on the camera that can't
focus closer than five or six feet, and the goslings climb into my lap to get the bread out
of the bag that I'm holding. Needless to say, I don't have any in-focus shots of them in my lap.

Oh and yes...you are correct. Metabolism is really not the right  word to
use for alcoholism or its causes. When I wrote that I was digging into  my
deep dark past and, maybe even wrongly remembering the old &quot;Chalk Talk&quot;
movies with the priest. Do you remember those? His explanation had  something to
do with the differences in the way alcoholics metabolize alcohol  down more
slowly than non- alcoholics.... Why that came to my mind ???  I  also was
thinking about &quot;Asian Flush&quot; which is also considered a defect in the  way the
alcohol is metabolized in roughly about half of the Asian  population. I had
a dear friend in college who was 1/4 Asian, and this happened  to her. She
didn't drink much because of it...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. They used to use that &quot;metabolism&quot; word a lot. And I think the Asian flush does actually
have something to do with metabolism of alcohol. But that isn't my problem.

Oh well, maybe someday the truth will come out. If you read the  link I
sent to you about ADD, it is already happening. The research is  being done,
lets hope it continues.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I think the truth is getting out, but far too slowly. The Big Lie has the momentum of
the Queen Mary. It takes a long time to stop.

<p>

Oh.... and one more thing. I don't drink at all anymore. Whatever I  used to
think it did for me has no appeal. Since I have been properly medicated
and am in therapy the &quot;impulse&quot; to drink is just gone! Hey, I am on the very
dark side of 45..... drinking too much makes you look old, AND feel crummy!
So  anyway, if I see any new research I will send it off to you!

Just a quick note to say thanks!! I  love those Mallards, they are so
beautiful, or I guess handsome may be a better word.

<p>
oh and thanks for the picture tips, I will keep trying!

<p>
Take care,<br>

Oh, by the way, my photography tips are definitely weird. I doubt if
many other nature photographers would approve. They seem to think
that feeding the wildlife is cheating or violating the wild
critters' purity or something. :-)
<p>
Of course, when I ask the ducks and geese, they say that I should feed
them even more. Especially munchies like sweet sticky cinnamon rolls.
The goslings go crazy over those things.
They think that bread is manna from Heaven, but sweet sticky
cinnamon rolls are the food of the gods. They love the different tastes
of things like cinnamon. And they love sweets.
<p>
Proving once again, that the goslings are children, and
not much different from human children that way...
<p>
Have a good day and a good End of the World. (Hah!)

Cinnamon rolls....leftover cinnamon donuts. When my kids were  little they
would go down to the pier and feed them the cinnamon donuts that  everyone
hated.

<p>
And yes I will see you on the other side sometime later today!  LOL

I actually heard the leader of that cult on the radio yesterday. He  really

Hi again, Renee,
<p>
I think the thing about cinnamon is that they just like a variety of tastes. The geese's natural
diet is just grass. Grass, grass, grass. Grass for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Now and then they pick the grass seed off of the grass for something a little more nourishing,
but it's basically just a steady diet of grass. Cinnamon is something
that they can never get in the wild because it only grows on the other side of the world.
<p>
Well, the geese are only human, and they like a little variety in their diet too.
They like to experience different tastes.
So they like people bringing them other stuff, no matter whether it is bread or rice or candy bars,
cookies, corn chips, or french fries, or whatever. Just a little something to break the
monotony of the grass.
<p>
I don't give them much junk food, but a little doesn't hurt them any, and they enjoy a taste treat
now and then.
<p>
Have a good day.
<p>
Oh, by the way, about the end of the world, I heard that the guy made millions in donations.
He just might be crazy like a fox.
What a racket: &quot;The world is going to end tomorrow, so send me all of your money today.&quot;
Yes, some people will believe anything.

BLOG NOTE: 2011.05.20:
<p>
Happy end of the world everybody. And have a good Saturday even if the world doesn't end tomorrow.
<p>

Oh, by the way: I heard that the world is supposed to end at 6 PM. But 6 PM in whose time zone?
The theological implications are staggering. It makes a huge difference whether New York,
Los Angeles, or Las Vegas gets to determine the time of the end of the world.
If Las Vegas  &#8212;  Sin City  &#8212;  gets to do it, that would be, as Opus once said, an aesthetic
disaster of Biblical proportions.
