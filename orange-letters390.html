Subject: Thank you for your e-mail..<br>
<p>

Dearest Agent Orange

<p>
This morning while I was in the kitchen, I heard my wife and her 
friend ( who is a medical doctor) calling me to come into the computer 
room and read my e-mail response from my buddy...Agent Orange....They 
were literally wiping coffee off of my computer desk because they were 
laughing so hard. We all had a huge laugh at observing which one of 
Agent Orange's fantasies he was in when he received my e-mail.  
Obviously, you were in one of your fantasies where, you imagined 
yourself as a psychologist.....That fantasy is called the Dr. Orange 
syndrome, which goes along with the Pastor Orange fantasy, and then 
there is the Healer Guru Orange fantasy, and of course, the Professor 
Orange fantasy and then finally the addiction expert fantasy.....I 
apologize, but my eyes are still tearing up laughing.  ( I'll be right 
back*L*)

<p>
Your response was just as I had expected.  Once again, you just 
change word's to make it look like you are superior to other people and 
are really a true intellectual.....I won't even waste my time discussing 
how you simply used the wording changes saying, &quot;it is a  bit of a 
puzzle&quot;, and/or
&quot;one day I suddenly snapped out of it,&quot; etc. etc.....*yawn*.......Next 
subject please.......Now you supposedly went through DT's at home and 
knew exactly what was happening, right ?..... if in fact it happened at 
all.....Let's move forward to the doctor office scene okay ?.....Do you 
really think that a alcoholic that has gone through DT's would need a 
M.D. to tell him that he needs to stop drinking ?.... Aren't you leaving 
out something Secret AgentOrange ?
<p>
Did you not need this medical doctors evaluation for alcoholism with 
your paperwork so you could collect disability for life from the 
government ?  Let's not forget that you told the room for years that you 
were a disabled veteran......Remember ?

<p>
During this time I was sending you cash. Remember ?  I kept asking 
you if you had been kicked out of the military...and you would not 
answer. Four years later it came out that the air force had kicked you 
out... But I still felt sorry for you when you got kicked out of your 
government assisted apartment in Oregon... I sent you more money once 
again, but you told me you never saw it ?  Then I find out that you have 
moved into another homeless shelter ?  Wait a minute.....this was at 
over 5 years sobriety....what the hell's going on ?  You write about 
your friends and your son and step children etc... Would not any of them 
want to help out dear old dad ?  I mean dad has been sober for over 5 
years right ?  Something is wrong here....

<p>
Agent orange/dad has been in a dream world...making believe he is a 
therapist and a religious healer and addiction clinician. He is doing 
this on the internet. What's going on ?  Orange thinks he is saving 
alcoholics lives....Make believe Guru Orange goes into absolute rages on 
a regular basis if anyone dare have opinions different that his.  He is 
insulting and dominating and simply a bully and a coward. And this is 
the guy who says he was bullied by his father. Agent Orange is the same 
as his father.  Except his father supported him and even sent him to 
college. Then he flunked out because of drugs and depression. This is 
the guy who was going to jump to his death as a teenager from a tall 
college building.. And this is what is important to me and would be to 
all Orange's readers.  Very important....

<p>
Agent Orange wants more than anything else in the world for his 
readers to think he is intelligent. Probably a hip college professor 
type of guy would be one of his many fantasies.  My message to Orange 
has been for him to try and work on his anger and live in reality.  But 
that has been to no avail.  Orange's fantasy world is more important to 
him than anything, including his children.  Secret Agent Orange is 
capable of working and can repair computers for money....Even 10 hours 
per month @ $50.00 per hour could add up to $500.00 per month.  That 
$500.00 could be sent to his grandchildren for their college education 
or clothes or whatever.  Or possibly to his children directly.  Now we 
are only talking about 10 hours per month.  But I am afraid that will 
never happen.  I invested money and trust and hope with Agent Orange 
since the very start of this site.  I had hopes that Orange would be man 
enough to take responsibility for his past. I was warned against sending 
money to Orange or putting faith in his actual intentions. But, we shall 
see.  You never know.  I have seen people change in sobriety!

<p>
One last important thing for any readers to understand is this:  Terry 
and I are not enemies. We both have similar dislikes for the fellowship 
of Alcoholics Anonymous. Our backgrounds and ages are so similar that it 
is borderline spooky. I don't like Terry's sassy girly acid tongue 
mouth.  I have begged him to stop being an asshole, hiding behind a 
computer, but he can't help himself.  The hit numbers on the site have 
gone up but the amount of money that comes in through pay pal is like 
less $.75 cents per day.  Maybe Hippy Terry thinks money is bad and he 
enjoys living on the edge...I don't know...But I do know this...Money is 
needed for attorneys that continue to fight making it illegal to force 
people into A.A. through our court systems.  Once that victory takes 
place, I don't care if A.A. goes broke or not. I think Terry tries to 
score chicks with this site. And I wish he would.  Maybe it would stop 
him from being a little bully prick.  But putting out messages like, 
&quot;Buy a Hallmark card and help a girl in AA get raped&quot; is why the 
professionals out there don't take Terry seriously.

<p>
Oh well have a nice day.

<p>
Now, I did not engage in word games. I answered your question directly.
I am not mystified by my sobriety. I know why I am sober. It's because I
don't drink alcohol. I know why I do not drink alcohol. It's because I
don't want to be that sick again.
<p>
The only thing that mystifies me is how I could change my mind so suddenly
and completely and know that it was in my power to both quit smoking and quit drinking.
That cool steel determination and confidence is a wonder.

<p>
About your other accusations: No, I never got any certification of alcoholism from the Veterans Administration
for a disability pension.
In fact, the Multnomah County Veterans' Outreach advisor who was helping me with the paperwork told me to never
mention it. The VA won't give pensions for alcoholism or drug addiction because they consider that
self-inflicted damage. (Their policy is the exact opposite of the A.A. dogma that says that
 &quot;we are powerless over alcohol&quot;.)

<p>
It isn't the responsibility of family or friends to support me, and I never asked them to.
In fact, my family didn't even know what was going on. I didn't tell them.

<p>
About the money that you say you have donated to the Orange Papers:

About working as a computer repairman, alas, those days are gone forever.
(You sure are eager to get me out of retirement. Why is that?)
I am so crippled by sciatica (a crushed disk in my spine) that I cannot stand for
more than a few minutes and cannot walk more than about 2 city blocks
before the pain is just too much. It's an endurance test just to stand at the sink and wash
the dishes. I have to do it in pieces. Wash a few things, then sit down to rest and let the
pain pass, and then do a little more, and then rest, then do a little more.
Working a straight job all day is out of the question.

<p>
My powers of concentration aren't as good as they used to be either,
so computer programming is out. Hi tech is very much like athletics: a young man's game.
You don't see 67-year-old athletes competing with the young dudes in football or
basketball or baseball, or any other major sport. Or in computer programming.
Those arrogant young whipper-snappers dominate the field.
<p>
Worse yet, most of what I know is now actually obsolete. I'm constantly playing
catch-up just to keep abreast of the new stuff. In just the last two weeks, I had
to learn (the hard way, of course) about GPT partition tables to format a
4 terabyte drive, and a new program to write the partition tables
(parted and gparted).
Fdisk is dead.  Trusty old Fdisk, which I've been using for almost 30 years, is history,
as are all of the old partition table formats. Too small. They ran out of numbers for sectors.
<p>
It's going that way with everything. It's hard to believe how much stuff is obsolete
and even positively ancient.

<p>
And I'm struggling to learn MySQL and PHP because that is what the Drupal forum is written with.
It's a very steep learning curve.
<p>
I'm expert in Assembly Language on half a dozen different micros, and also expert at C.
I can still program a Motorola M6800 8-bit microprocessor in assembly language
in my sleep, but what the world wants now is Android 4.0 apps for smart phones.
So it goes.
<p>
&quot;Life is change, how it differs from the rocks.&quot;  Gracie Slick sang that. <i>Crown of Creation</i> album.
<p>
Besides, I already have a job: doing the Orange Papers. You don't want me to abandon that,
now do you?  Or do you?

<p>
Back to the physical plane:
Just getting to and from the public library is getting to be an ordeal. I fought my way through the snow
to ride my bike to the library yesterday, and fell once when my front wheel got out of the groove
in the snow made by car tires. Fortunately, I wasn't injured. (I used to play roller hockey, so I know how to fall.)
Still, it's getting to be an ordeal.

<p>
On a different subject:
So you think that professionals don't take me seriously because I criticize Hallmark for promoting A.A.
while A.A. refuses to do anything to stop the sexual exploitation of young women in A.A.?
I disagree. Do you have any evidence, besides perhaps your wife's opinion?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and I hope you get to feeling happier soon.

February 11, 2014, Tuesday, my yard in Forest Grove:

<p>
I saw my little friend at the Hummingbird feeder again today &#8212;
 and snapped a couple of pictures
before I frightened him away by moving in too close, trying to get better shots.
You don't see any red on his head because of the bad lighting. The sky is filled with
dense cloud cover and no direct sunlight filters through. Under those conditions, his
head appears to be either black or very dark green. And his throat appears to be black.
Under good sunlight, his whole head will appear to be bright red.

Again, you can see the little white tongue sticking out. They are like
other birds in that they have to raise their heads to swallow liquids.
And apparently working their tongue in and out helps them to swallow.
<p>
Those white vertical lines in the background are raindrops.
The weather has warmed up a lot, and it's like 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so
the snow is melting. The storm is over. My feeders are still the only
&quot;flowers&quot; with nectar for the Hummingbirds to eat.
<p>
I am amazed that Annas Hummingbirds can survive the winter without
much in the way of flowers or insects to eat. How do they scrounge up
enough food to avoid starvation? Under normal summer
conditions, they eat continuously all day long. 
They eat a meal every five minutes. Literally.
The appetite on those things is superhuman.
They have extremely high energy needs because they are fast
little buzz-balls that are almost constantly in motion, and
their wings beat something like 600 times per minute.
They have to essentially hibernate at night to keep from starving
during the night.  They go into a &quot;torpor&quot;, which
means that their hearts slow way down, their breathing
slows way down, and their body temperature drops way down.
That is pretty much the same as hibernation, and they do it
every night to conserve energy.
<p>
And yet they somehow survive the winter without flowers or
insects to eat, and they are out flying around when the ground
is covered with snow. Unbelievable. They are tough little creatures.

As if...<br>
Because the program of recovery that has been instrumental in turning my
life and the lives of hundreds of others around doesn't appeal to you, suit
you, make sense to you, you condemn it and its basis that a spiritual
experience can do what science, psychiatry, medicine and sheer force of
will cannot.
<p>
Perhaps the energy spent in punching the air could be turned to other, more
edifying pursuits.
<p>
Further, I believe Buchman was very wrong-headed. I do not hold with the
mental contortions he used to cobble up the 4 Absolutes. Personally I see
them as a formula for self defeat, self-deception and a form of
pride-baited arrogance.
<p>
I sincerely doubt, from what I've read of your commentaries, that you are
an alcoholic of the hopeless variety; there IS something wrong, but
possibly nothing that could be changed by the program of recovery outlined
in the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;. Be very careful with the &quot;facts&quot; and
&quot;statistics&quot; you claim; the analyses have been and continue to be
manipulated to suit the users, which cuts both ways.
<p>
For you, and undoubtedly many others, AA didn't or couldn't work. Does that
mean the program of recovery doesn't work at all? Hardly. But where there's
success, there are those who will say it's a sham.
<p>
Our experiences are different. Does that mean one or the other is wrong? No.<br>
Good luck.<br>

Hello again, Mac,
<p>
Thanks for the response. Unfortunately, you are repeating a lot of standard
A.A. slogans.
<ol>
<p><li>
A.A. is not a &quot;program of recovery&quot;. A.A. is Dr. Frank Buchman's old cult religion,
passed off as a cure for alcohol addiction.

<p><li>
A.A. has not &quot;been instrumental in turning my
life and the lives of hundreds of others...&quot;
A.A. is just another cult religion that steals the credit from people who get
themselves sober.

<p><li>
A.A. most assuredly does not have any magical &quot;spiritual
experience&quot; that &quot;can do what science, psychiatry, medicine and sheer force of
will cannot.&quot; That is just more cult religion baloney.

<p>
YES!!! That is the heart of the matter. That is the most important paragraph
that you have written.  Alcoholics Anonymous is merely Frank Buchman's
cult religion, dressed up as a cure for alcohol abuse.
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
The 12 Steps are just Dr. Frank Buchman's practices for indoctrinating and converting
newcomers into true believers in his cult religion</a>.
They have nothing to do with drinking, and never did. They are
Frank Buchman's brainwashing techniques. Bill Wilson just copied them.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is Buchmanism. That's what is wrong with it. That is why A.A. does
not work to free people from alcohol addiction.

(Bill Wilson was of course being deceptive there. Bill listed Rev. Sam
Shoemaker as the leader of the Oxford Groups. Actually, Sam Shoemaker
was the number two man. Frank Buchman was the leader, and he is the man
who created and promoted all of that perverted religious dogma. But
Frank Buchman had a terrible reputation for
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#praise_Hitler2" target="_blank">his praise of Adolf Hitler
and Heinrich Himmler and the Nazis</a>,
so Bill thought it best to avoid mentioning the Buchman name.)

Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?

came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier

This is more baloney:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I sincerely doubt, from what I've read of your commentaries, that you are
an alcoholic of the hopeless variety...<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It does not matter whether you think I am an alcoholic of any particular type.
That is yet another standard A.A. trick: claim that somebody isn't a
&quot;real alcoholic&quot;, or a &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot;, so what he says doesn't count.
That is invalid logic. (And A.A. members try to pull that trick so often. Look here:
<a href="orange-letters83.html#dts" target="_blank">really an alcoholic...</a>)

<p>
A.A. will still be the same failure no matter whether I am a hopeless alcoholic or
a virgin tea-totaller, or an old alcoholic with 13 years of sobriety (which is what
I really am).

<p><li>
Then you continued: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...there IS something wrong, but
possibly nothing that could be changed by the program of recovery outlined

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well please don't hold out on us. What do you think is wrong with someone who tells the
truth about an old cult religion like Buchmanism? Or its child cult like A.A.?
<p>
What kind of mental illness makes someone care about the welfare of sick people?
Please tell us. Maybe we can infect some Republican politicians with the disease.

<p><li>
Then you wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
Actually, it is A.A. that twists the numbers to create the illusion of a successful program.
We were just talking about that. Here are the links:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214556/http://www.aa.org/" target="_blank">The official A.A. web site</a>
claims that the average sobriety time of A.A. members is 8 years. That is obviously
untrue, and physically impossible, because A.A. does not have one 16-year oldtimer
to match with each newcomer so that the two of them average out at 8 years
of sobriety each.  Nor do they have two 12-year oldtimers to match with each
newcomer, so that the three of them together average 8 years each. And so on.
The A.A. web site is publishing lies. Period.  (There is more on that
<a href="orange-letters330.html#Iamnotastatistic" target="_blank">here</a>.)

</ul>

<p>
Speaking of success rate, I see that you dodged the question that I asked
<a href="orange-letters389.html#Mac" target="_blank">in the last letter</a>
about the A.A. success rate.  That is typical. A.A. true believers <i>NEVER</i>
honestly answer that question.
<p>
So once again, what is the A.A. success rate? If we send 100 alcoholics to A.A.,
how many will be sober a year later? 5 years later? 10 years later? 20 years later?
<p>
That question is super-important. If A.A. does not sober them up, then it is worthless
and a cruel hoax.
<p>
Actually, A.A. is worse than worthless, because it wastes people's
time and keeps them from doing something that might really help them.

<p>
A.A. defenders routinely try to dismiss all statistics as worthless because the true
numbers reveal what a failure A.A. really is.  The funny thing is, even Bill Wilson
used statistics (which he simply made up):
<p> 
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

path.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson,

</blockquote>
<p>
What does &quot;rarely&quot; mean?  What number is that?
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.
Other thousands came to a few A.A. meetings and at first decided
they didn't want the program. But great numbers of these &#8212; about
two out of three &#8212; began to return as time passed.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, in the Foreword to the Second Edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, page XX, 1955.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The problem is, Bill Wilson was just lying when he made up those numbers.
You can see all of the information about that here:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial</a>

<p><li>
Then you wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For you, and undoubtedly many others, AA didn't or couldn't work.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wrong. I soon recognized that A.A. was a brainwashing program and a cult religion,
so I quit drinking my own way. I never did the 12 Steps, I never got a sponsor,
I don't go to A.A. meetings, I don't believe in the <i>Big Book</i> or Bill Wilson,
and yet I still have 13 years of sobriety now. <i><b>MY</b></i> program works great.  

<p><li>
You continued:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Does that mean the program of recovery doesn't work at all? Hardly. But where there's
success, there are those who will say it's a sham.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, A.A. is not a program of recovery.
A.A. is Dr. Frank Buchman's program to convert newcomers into brainwashed cult members.
<p>
Yes, A.A. is a sham and a fraud.
<p><ul> <li>
When some people quit drinking in or near an A.A. meeting, A.A. is quick to claim
the credit and say that the Steps work great. (Even if the person didn't do the Steps.)
<li> When someone does not quit drinking, A.A. claims that it has no responsibility for him,
and the Steps had nothing to do with it.
</ul>
That is just &quot;cherry picking&quot;. The proper name for that is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">Observational Selection</a>
&#8212; counting the hits and forgetting the misses.
<p>
The fact that a few people quit drinking while attending A.A. meetings does not
mean that A.A. made them quit drinking. People decide to quit drinking for a variety
of reasons, like to save their lives or their jobs or marriages, and then they go to a
few A.A. meetings to see what A.A. has to offer, and the A.A. true believers set to
work trying to convince the newcomers that they quit drinking <i>because of</i> A.A.,
which is simply false.

<p><li>
Then you said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our experiences are different. Does that mean one or the other is wrong? No.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
That is the debating trick called 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">escape via relativism</a>:
just claim that &quot;your mileage may vary; we had different experiences, nobody
is right and nobody is wrong, it's just your opinion versus my opinion...&quot;
Baloney. A.A. is a hoax and a fraud that fails to sober up the alcoholics.
And those are the facts.

<p>
Again, if you think that I am wrong, then please tell us: What is the A.A. success rate?
You claim that A.A. works, so prove it. Show us the numbers. What percentage
of the newcomers to A.A.  get and stay sober for 1, 5, 10, and 20 years?
And how does that compare to people who quit drinking without A.A.?
Please verify your information.

<p>
The answer to that question is a matter of life or death for a lot of people.
<p>
Speaking of which, I'm sure that you have heard some of the publicity about 
<a href="orange-letters389.html#Tom_M" target="_blank">the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>.
He was in A.A. for many, many years, more than 13 years,
 and yet, he still died of a heroin overdose.
So what is A.A. really worth if that is the final result of &quot;working the Steps&quot;?

February 13, 2014, Thursday, my yard in Forest Grove:

<p>

While I was feeding the birds in the back yard, I heard the whirr of Hummingbird wings.
I looked around to find where the bird was, and discovered that she was right beside me.
I mean, so close that I could have reached out and touched her. I was standing right beside
a Hummingbird feeder, and she wanted to eat from it, so she did. I couldn't get a photo
of her because she was too close &#8212; the telephoto lens can't focus that close.
I just stood still and watched breathlessly while she slurped up some sugar-water.
She was amazingly tame. She knew that I was there, but as long as I didn't move,
it didn't bother her.

<p>
But a few minutes later, when I was about 8 feet away from the feeder, she came
back, and I got this shot:

Female Annas Hummingbird
</center>
</font></font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Alas, she didn't like the sound of the mirror and shutter of the camera snapping,
so she zoomed away after one shot.  Then I found her in the front yard, at the
front porch feeder. And she zoomed away as I approached.  She is still very
cautious, and interprets me moving towards her as stalking.
<p>
All three of the Hummingbird feeders that are currently hanging in my yard
are thawed out and working now, so she can run me in circles going from
one feeder to the next. But something that is obvious is that she is
staying around my yard.  But of course, that's where the food is. I think she
will adopt my yard as her home. Maybe she already has.
<p>
So I have a breeding pair of Annas Hummingbirds visiting my yard. That's great.
Remember that line in the movie <i>Field of Dreams</i>? &quot;If you build it, they will come.&quot;
Well, the Hummingbirds have come. If you have the only working bird cafeteria in
the neighborhood, you will have a very popular yard. Especially during the winter
when everything is buried under snow. 
<p>
I can already see baby Hummingbirds come springtime.
(By the way, baby Hummingbirds are really, really tiny.)

From: Tim D.<br>
Subject: Statistical source<br>
<p>

Hello, I'm writing a paper arguing that addiction is a choice, not a disease.
I would really like to use your claims as proof for my paper but i not allowed
to if I can't show who produced the statistic, with what data, at what time and place.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tim,
<p>
Thank you for a very interesting question. Unfortunately, I think you have
chosen a very knotty problem.
<p>
The first problem is that there is no statistical evidence that shows that addiction
is a disease.  I mean none, zilch, zippo. It's really a question of semantics,
not statistics.
Ask people what they mean by &quot;disease&quot;.  You will get a lot of vague answers
and fancy tap-dancing.
<p>
The dictionaries list a lot of different definitions of disease.
Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-definitions.html#disease" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-definitions.html#disease</a>
<p>
Some definitions of &quot;disease&quot; are so generalized that they call any condition that
causes pain or discomfort a &quot;disease&quot;. (Disease == &quot;dis - ease&quot;)
By that definition, playing football is a disease.

<p>
Then you will get the deliberate misinformation and clouding of the issue, like the A.M.A.
has done. They had a committee composed of two A.A. front groups write the definition
of &quot;alcoholism the disease&quot; that is so garbled that it does not even say that
drinking alcohol causes alcoholism.  See the story here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters28.html#AMA</a>
<p>
By the way, not even the A.M.A. could provide a good definition of &quot;disease&quot;.
Nor could they explain the etiology of the &quot;disease&quot;. I mean, come on, &quot;the disease
of alcoholism&quot; must have a cause.

<p>
The kind of information that you are looking for is in the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
There you will find clinical studies and randomized longitudinal controlled studies
and doctors' reports about tests of A.A., and also the
natural spontaneous recovery rate without treatment.
It's all fully documented and referenced, and your teacher will be happy with such
references. 
<p>
I also just found this quote in my notes.
I don't know where it came from.
 The file name hints that it came from Australia.
Perhaps a Google search can establish the source.
Anyway, it gives a bunch of interesting references:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By 1956 the American Medical Association voted to define alcoholism as a medically treatable disease, a decision based not on analysis of scientific evidence, but on economic grounds, to enable treating physicians to become eligible for payment from third parties, i.e. insurance companies (AMA) (Hanson).  The AMA's move stirred controversy, but Jellinek justified it by saying that a disease is anything that doctors choose to call a disease. (Jellinek.) Dr. Jeffrey Schaler famously argued that &quot;simply calling alcoholism a disease does not make it one.&quot; (Schaler, 1989.) 
<p>
Confirming this more complex picture, in 2010 America's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism released findings based on the most sophisticated study yet conducted of drinking histories (NIAAA.)  It surveyed more than 43,000 individuals representative of the adult population using questions based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Published in 1994, DSM-IV recognises alcohol dependence by preoccupation with drinking, impaired control over drinking, compulsive drinking, drinking despite physical or psychological problems caused or made worse by drinking, and tolerance and/or withdrawal symptoms.
<p>
Among NIAAA's findings were:
<p>
<ul>
<li>     Most persons who develop alcohol dependence have mild to moderate disorder, in which they primarily experience impaired control. For example, they set limits and go over them or find it difficult to quit or cut down. In general, these people do not have severe alcohol-related relationship, health, vocational or legal problems.
<li>     About 70 percent of affected persons have a single episode of less than 4 years. The remainder experience an average of five episodes. Thus, it appears that there are two forms of alcohol dependence: time-limited, and recurrent or chronic.
<li>     Twenty years after onset of alcohol dependence, about three-fourths of individuals are in full recovery; more than half of those who have fully recovered drink at low-risk levels without symptoms of alcohol dependence.
<li>     About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab) programs and AA. 
</ul>
<p>
Only 1% of those surveyed fit the stereotypical image of someone with severe, recurring alcohol addiction. NIAAA's Mark Willenbring, director of treatment and recovery research, commented, &quot;These and other recent findings turn on its head much of what we thought we knew about alcoholism.&quot; (NIAAA.) Willenbring told the media, &quot;It can be a chronic, relapsing disease, but it isn't usually that. We're on the cusp of some major advances in how we conceptualise alcoholism. The focus now is on the large group of people who are not yet dependent. But they are at risk for developing dependence. From what we know from scientific studies, there are some very clear things that can be done. But people don't ordinarily think of looking to science for how to improve drinking problems.&quot; (Roan.)
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I know the source of the NIAAA quote:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214556/http://www.spectrum.niaaa.nih.gov/features/alcoholism.aspx" target="_blank">
http://www.spectrum.niaaa.nih.gov/features/alcoholism.aspx</a>

<p>
<a name="Jellinek"> </a>
By the way, &quot;Dr.&quot; Jellinek, the modern proponent of the
<i>&quot;alcoholism is a disease&quot;</i> theory, was not a doctor.
He was a fraud and a quack. He faked all of his degrees and credentials.
He didn't even earn a B.A. degree. He never graduated from college.
His transcript at the University of Leizig, where he supposedly got his B.A., says
that Jellinek was dropped from the University's rolls in both 1913 and 1914,
for failure to attend lectures or take classes.
And yet he lied his way into the Yale faculty and passed himself off as a doctor and
a scientific researcher, the world's expert on alcoholism.
Check out what Stanton Peele and Ron Roizen have to say about Jellinek:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214556/http://www.roizen.com/ron/rr11.htm" target="_blank">http://www.roizen.com/ron/rr11.htm</a><br>

<p>
Three good sources of information on the question of addiction as a disease are:
<ol>
<p><li>
<i>Addiction is a Choice</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeffrey A. Schaler.<br>
Open Court Publishing Company, 2000. phone: 1-800-815-2280<br>
ISBN: 0-8126-9403-1 hardcover, 0-8126-9404-1 paperback.<br>
Dewey: 362.29 S297a 2000<br>
Quite good. This book makes a good case for the standard ideas
of addiction and the A.A. idea of &quot;powerlessness over alcohol&quot;
being myths. Must reading for anyone wishing to be well-informed in
the alcoholism or addiction fields.<br>
Also see Schaler's web site:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214556/http://www.schaler.net/fifth/cultbusting.html" target="_blank">
http://www.schaler.net/fifth/cultbusting.html</a>

<p><li>
<i>Diseasing of America</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Stanton Peele, Ph.D.<br>
Lexington Books, D.C. Heath and Company, Lexington, Massachusetts &amp; Toronto, 1989.<br>
ISBN: 0-669-20015-8<br>
LC: RC564.P43 1989<br>
LCCN: 89-31904<br>
Dewey: 362.29&#8212;dc20<br>
Very good. Puts forward the idea that addiction is not a disease, and neither are many
of the other things that are being called mental illnesses these days. The &quot;treatment
industry&quot; is essentially a racket that practices quack medicine.
<br>
Stanton Peele lists some experiments and controlled studies that show that alcoholics
have control over their drinking. They are not &quot;powerless&quot;.

<p><li>
<i>Addiction, Change &amp; Choice; The New View of Alcoholism</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Vince Fox, M.Ed. CRREd.<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731, 1993.<br>
ISBN: 0-9613289-7-5<br>
Dewey: 362.29286i FOX<br>
And yet another great book from the See Sharp Press.
Fox covers:
<ol>
<li> Heavy Drinking: Its Historical Context
<li> Alcoholism: Definitions &amp; Opinions
<li> Polarization: Us vs. Them
<li> The Objective: Personal Autonomy
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Essence &amp; Functions
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Effectiveness
<li> The Forces &amp; Directions of Change
<li> The Independent Self-Help Programs
<li> Rational Recovery Systems Network
<li> Traditional Recovery Management
<li> Nontraditional Recovery Management
<li> Nontraditional Recovery Management
<li> Noninstitutional Recovery
<li> ...and more...
</ol>
One of the things I like best is how Fox stresses just
how damaging and dangerous it is for A.A. and N.A. to teach
addicts that they are powerless over alcohol or their addiction, and
have no choice in the matter. That is a ready-made rationalization
for a drunkard to have another drink, and for a doper to shoot up again.
And that is what the steppers do.
Fox also does a good job of criticizing the arrogant
<i>&quot;My way or the highway&quot;</i>
attitude of self-righteous A.A. and N.A. sponsors.

</ol>
<p>
Another factor to consider is that there is not any one stereotypical alcoholic
or drug addict.
Note that in the above quote, the NIAAA said,
&quot;Only 1% of those surveyed fit the stereotypical image of someone with severe, recurring alcohol addiction.&quot;
The causes of people excessively using drugs or alcohol until they get addicted
are numerous: 
mental illness (especially depression, bipolar disorder and narcissistic personality disorder),
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">damage inflicted upon them in childhood</a>,
bad environments (like wars and slums) driving people to drink, and
then there are the veterans with PTSD who drink to forget, and
there are people who have genetic disorders. There are people who are sick and in physical pain,
and they are trying to blank it out.
There are people who are in existential crises who don't think that life is worth living.
There are even people who drink to kill the pain from too much drinking and too much smoking.
There are a zillion different causes for &quot;alcoholism&quot; or addiction.


<p>
Oh, and lastly, my own personal experience is that addiction is a choice.
I was addicted to tobacco for 30 years, and drank too much for almost 20, and then,
when my health collapsed and I was facing death, I just quit all of my bad habits
all at once. (And that was 13 years ago, and I'm still sober and healthy.)
It was a choice. It was a tough choice, and it took being really sick for me to get
the motivation to quit, but I did.
And that story is so common. That is how most successful quitters finally do it.

**     Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision

**     disease but an error in judgment. When a bunch of people begin to
**     do it, it is a social error, a life-style. In this particular
**     life-style the motto is &quot;Be happy now because tomorrow you are
**     dying,&quot; but the dying begins almost at once, and the happiness is
**     a memory. It is, then, only a speeding up, an intensifying, of the
**     ordinary human existence. It is not different from your life-style,
**     it is only faster. It all takes place in days or weeks or months
**     instead of years. &quot;Take the cash and let the credit go,&quot; as Villon
**     said in 1460. But that is a mistake if the cash is a penny and the
**     credit a whole lifetime.

P.S.: I was just rereading another page of debate about whether alcoholism
is a disease,
&quot;Is Alcoholism a Disease?&quot;, by David J. Hanson, Ph.D., here:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321214556/http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol/categories/Abuse.html" target="_blank">
http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol/categories/Abuse.html</a>
<p>
Dr. Hanson quoted Dr. Stanton Peele:
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<h2>Negative Results of the Disease Theory</h2>
<p>
The disease concept of alcoholism removes the responsibility of alcoholics for
their own behaviors.<font size="-1"><sup>14</sup></font> Dr. Peele asserts that
&quot;Perhaps the most dire consequence of the disease model of addiction is that it
has encouraged the abdication of individual responsibility for outrageous conduct&quot;
and he suggests that &quot;Creating a world of addictive diseases may mean creating a
world in which anything is excusable.&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>15</sup></font><br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Ah yes. I was reminded of Ariel Castro, the creep in Cleveland, Ohio, who kidnapped,
imprisoned, and raped three women for 10 years, including beating one of them
into a miscarriage because he didn't want the baby.
At his sentencing, he whined,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I'm not a monster. I'm a decent guy. I'm sick.
I have an addiction.  Just like alcoholics have an
addiction. I need therapy.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh yeh. &quot;I kidnap, imprison, and rape women and kill their baby because I have
a disease just like alcoholism.&quot; <i>NOT!</i>

Mister T,<br>
The latest aa bulletin says the hot-line in our Long Island county is reducing
the 24-hour coverage.  You can read many months of bulletins at

I am not sure I have done this correctly but I know you like to read about 
other aa activity so I am trying.
<p>
Thank you for all you do.<br>

Hello again, Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. What that tells me is that they are having shrinkage problems.
Membership, staffing, and money all shrinking. Now they don't have the resources to
staff a hotline 24-7?
That used to be a point of pride in a lot of intergroups. &quot;Always available, always
ready to help. Available 24 hours a day.&quot;
So you know they wouldn't be cutting back if they could avoid it.

<p>
Not coincidentally, another correspondent just reported that
the list of scheduled major A.A. events has recently shrunk enormously:
<p>

<p>
It's about time. How many decades can a dishonest quack cure keep on fooling people?
<p>
I recall President Lincoln's line about,
&quot;You can fool all of the people some of the time. You can fool some of the people
all of the time. But you can't fool all of the people all of the time.&quot;

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi again, Peter,
<p>
Yes, I definitely have to get my hands on a copy of that. Stanton and Ilse are two of
my favorite people, so I know that book will be good.

UPDATE: 2014.02.13:
<p>
At 3:34 AM, I heard National Public Radio News say that the TIME &#8212; AOL merger
was considered the worst corporate merger in history.
<p>
No joke. AOL just destroyed the
value of TIME stock. TIME Inc. was actually worth less after the merger than before,
which means that AOL had negative value. TIME paid billions of dollars for something
that turned out to be worth less than zero.
<p>
I could have told them that just from my own experiences with AOL.
<a href="orange-censored2.html" target="_blank">Back in 2005, AOL was censoring my web site and blocking my email</a>,
claiming that I had something to do with spamming, and AOL blacklisted me because
some account on my ISP's ISP in another state was sending out spam.
<p>
Well anyway, AOL is history now, and the verdict of history is that AOL was a disaster.
<p>
Have a good day now.
