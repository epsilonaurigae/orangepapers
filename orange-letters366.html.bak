Hello again John,
<p>
Thank you for the tip. That court case seems to be very important. The lower court judge was going
out of his way to make sure that the authorities who coerced cult religion on prisoners didn't
have to pay any money for their misbehavior, but the higher court was not going for it.
The higher court panel emphatically declared that paying damages was not discretionary  &#8212; 
the offenders must pay.
<p>
Thus, this case has far-reaching implications. Every judge, parole officer, and 
so-called &quot;therapist&quot; who forces people to attend 12-Step meetings can be sued for a lot of money.
This will change their behavior fast.
<p>
Talk is cheap. It's all inconsequential when a higher court merely says, &quot;Now now, the prisoner doesn't
have to go to your favorite religion. Let him go.&quot; And then they just do it to a hundred other people.
<p>
But when the coercers have to pay money, big money, that changes everything. That is real consequences.

Subject: Amazing information.<br>

<p>
Hey,
<p>
I came across some of your youtube videos and was interested. So for the last 6 months
have been reading and researching your information.  Amazing! ! I always knew these
things I just didn't have the concrete evidence.  I am a former heroin addict and
alcohol abuser. I am in a drug court program in Montgomery County PA.
 I must say its the biggest blunder of my life getting into this program.
<p>
 My first issue in the program was I was told by the judge I had to go to a 12-step
 program,  which then after a year of doing this thought wait this is a violation
of my first amendment.  Its a &quot;spiritual program&quot; and that takes away
my right of freedom of expression.  The judge is completely obsessed with AA and
NA and believes these frauds. And keeps telling us every week &quot;I have the
statistics&quot;, &quot;I have the evidence&quot;. I don't see it!
<p>
I believe knowledge is the best tool and CBT treatment has helped me with my behaviours.
Being called a disease is a crutch and a way for them to keep cashing in on those
who use in the program.  I have backed myself into a corner with this program and
the only way out is to go to jail. Any advice would be appreciated.
<p>
Thank you

Hello Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about your problems, but there is an answer.
In just the last couple of days, there has been a big flap in the news about a Federal appeals court
ruling that you can sue for damages when someone sentences you to a 12-Step program, because it
is coerced religion. And the appeals court was insistent that monetary damages <b><i>must</i></b>
be paid. The lower court judge was trying hard to avoid any real consequences
to the legal authorities for coerced
12-Step religion, by ruling that the coercers didn't have to really pay money,
but the Federal appeals court said that paying the big bucks was not optional, not discretionary.
Damages <i>must</i> be paid.

You are quite right that your judge does not have any statistics that prove that A.A. and
12-Step programs produce good success rates. They don't. In fact, the real results are entirely
negatives, like increased binge drinking and increased death rate:
<p>

<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found that A.A increased the rate of rearrests</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Walsh found that A.A increased the cost of hospitalization of alcoholics</a>.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a> found that having a
doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant, who went on to become an A.A. trustee, found that A.A. did not increase sobriety in alcoholics at all, not even a little bit, but it did raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.

<li>
So what's the actual A.A. cure rate?

<p>
I am recovered and abstinent fellow who also did it alone. I have a thought you might want to add to &quot;What Works,&quot;  a small addendum to
<a href="orange-letters191.html#play_the_tape" target="_blank">your &quot;Play the tape to the end&quot; concept</a>.

<p>
I call it &quot;Honestly evaluate what you will do when you know you should not take another drink during a drinking session.&quot;

<p>
For many of us with a history of alcohol problems, we will extend each drinking session until we pass out. We cruise past the logical stopping point every time. There is no safe dose.

<p>
Picture it: drinking, enjoying the hell out of it for the first hour or ninety minutes. But then, the judgment wavers.

<p>
For me, the logical quitting point was somewhere between four and seven drinks. I would not feel better after that, only worse. But I never quit there.

<p>
I always made the conscious decision of &quot;screw it.&quot; What am I going to do, lay on the couch watching TV while the buzz wears off, tired, alone, cranky and dehydrated? Sounds like a downer, man.

<p>
So the obvious Lizard Brain solution was to cruise past the satiation point and into oblivion.

<p>
I have found it very helpful whenever the &quot;get a drink&quot; voices start up to remember that I was unable to limit my consumption once under the influence of the drug.

<p>
It reminds me that there is no safe amount of alcohol for me to drink, that my judgment disappears just as the point of diminishing return on satisfaction is achieved.

<p>
It is a small tool that perhaps might be of use to others, thanks for the opportunity to share it.

<p>

A big Thank You for your site and research!!!  I thought the way I was feeling
was pretty uncommon, but evidently it's not.

<p>
My drinking had got to the point where it was having an impact on my life and
family.  I was very functional, but it got to the point where it just wasn't a
way to live.

<p>
I never: had a DUI, went to jail, got fired, was late to work or missed work, got
divorced, got in a fight, etc.
I have a good job, a great family, I give my seat up on buses to elderly folks,
I was a good kid and basically I think I'm an OK guy.  Problem was, I was just
drinking too much and it was getting worse.

<p>
I went to AA, actually was looking forward to it and was pretty regular
(meetings daily) for about 1.5 years.  It was good to see that there was a
like-minded group of people with a common problem, but I never, ever really
&quot;related&quot; to any of these guys.  I didn't think I was a failure, and
the relentless reliance on slogans and pat answers drove me nuts.  Whenever I
volunteered the opinion that &quot;AA is OK, but it isn't perfect&quot;, or that
the &quot;parts of the Big Book are actually pretty poorly-written&quot;, I got
pretty cold responses from the guys.

<p>
Basically, I got to a point where the program just wasn't doing anything for me:
 I've never once called my sponsor for advice (I have a wife and close friends
for that), I've never hung out w/ group members outside of meetings, and I only
&quot;officially&quot; made it through step 3.  I haven't mastered this thing by
a long shot, but I had (and still have) this feeling that the real answer was WAY
simpler than the program was making it:  just accept that I can't drink, that's
that, and move on w/ my life.  Hell, I go out w/ friends to bars, we have booze
here at the house (and have had since I quit 2 years ago) and when I decided
that alcohol and I had to part ways, there was ZERO temptation to drink.

<p>
It was really simple, and I'm very happy about that.  What makes me irritated was
the constant droning of my group to &quot;do the steps,&quot; &quot;don't over
analyze things,&quot; and in general, don't question anything about the Program
at all.  I never openly criticized or attacked anything about AA, but the overall
attitude of anti-critical thinking had me perplexed.  At meetings, I really was
tempted sometimes to just say &quot;My God, people!!  Just pull yourselves together
and get on with your lives!!&quot;

<p>
Reading through your site was a great gift:  finally someone I can relate to!!
 I think AA helped me in the beginning to realize I wasn't in this alone, but I
think I'm at a point where I need to move on.  Maybe I'll need to go back, maybe
I haven't been truly tested, but for now I'm happy and life is good.  I really
think God has more planned for me than going to 1-3 AA meetings a day like my
cohorts brag about.

<p>
I could go on for pages, but that'll do.  Thanks!

Hello Bratmeister,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and have
managed to maintain your sanity in spite of everything.
<p>
Of course I have to totally agree with you.
<p>
One of the first things that I noticed in your letter was
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">the A.A. desire to lump all drinkers together
and stereotype them</a>. As in,
<p>
<ul>
<li> &quot;We are all alcoholics, and alcoholics act this way.&quot;
<li> &quot;Hi, my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.&quot;
<li> &quot;Alcoholics must go to lots of meetings and Work The Steps or else very
bad things will happen to them.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
Wrong. We are not all the same. Somebody like you is a very different person from the guy who lost everything
and lived on the streets until he killed somebody in a drunken rage and went to prison.
Claiming that we are all just the same and that a one-size-fits-all cure will work
equally well for all of us is just plain wrong.
<p>
It really is more a matter of,
<ul>
<li>
&quot;On a scale of zero to 100, how much is alcohol hurting you and messing with your life?&quot;
<li> The second question is, &quot;On a scale of zero to 100, how much pleasure and fun is alcohol giving you?
<li> The third question is, &quot;Is it worth it?&quot;
</ul>


<p>
It's all shades of gray. It's all rating things by percentages.
Another word for that is &quot;rational&quot;, which comes from the word
&quot;ratio&quot;, which means &quot;a fraction&quot;.
Rational people can weigh things and rate things as maybe 75 or 80% good, but not 100%.
 But you noticed that the Stepper true-believers are not rational.
They cannot stand even a hint of criticism of their favorite cult religion. No, it has to be perfect,
an absolute good (the Oxford Group even used the term
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#four_absolutes">the &quot;Four Absolutes&quot;</a>)
and Bill and Bob were Saints who got The Message straight from God.
And any disagreement with that is not well received.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you didn't do Step Four. It's a really harmful mind-game:
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_confessions" target="_blank">The Cult of Confession</a>.
That's where you start the life-long practice of constantly talking about what is wrong
with you. Some people find that practice so depressing that 
<a href="orange-suicides.html" target="_blank">they commit suicide</a>.

<p>
Oh well, that fate is not for us.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	AA, etc<br>

<p>
Hi Terry,
<p>
I am so glad I found your site. Thank you so much.  Here's my experience with AA
and  how I found the orange papers.
<p>
I had been attending AA for a few months and, like you, I had heard a lot of good
things about it.  I was told to be open-minded, willing and so on.  My first
thoughts after a couple meetings were &quot;How the hell does this &quot;sharing&quot; stuff help
anybody?&quot; (I am not a fan of group therapy, never was) Then I started to read the
Big Book &#8212; my first impression was &quot;This guy Bill hates himself, and wants everybody
to feel bad.&quot;   I didnt read much but I remember something about &quot;we were all
actors&quot;  I thought to myself  &quot;fuck you Bill, you don't know me&quot;  So I threw my
first Big Book in the garbage and quit going.

<p>
About a year later I had started
smoking weed and drinking beer again  and had some problems , and tried AA again
thinking maybe I should give it a chance.  So I went back (this time I was
desperate) and really tried to listen.  After about 2 months of 12 n 12 study
meetings and BB meetings, and then getting to know some of the kooks
in AA (there were very few &quot;nice&quot; members at that meeting) I said to myself said
&quot;this sucks, it doesn't work, I don't like to hear people beating up on
themselves, and I'm feeling worse the more I go.&quot;  That's when I googled &quot;AA is a
cult&quot;  &#8212; your site was the first one to come up.
<p>
I started reading &quot;the orange papers&quot;  and everything  made sense, the overdose
deaths I had heard about, my feelings about the crazy literature, the wackadoodle
Big Book thumpers, the people relapsing etc.   I like  the site not only for
speaking the truth about AA, but the propaganda and debating tricks section and the
letters  are good too.   Well, I haven't drank since April (still struggling with
weed) and I feel pretty good.  One thing, I did manage to find an AA meeting close
to where I live where  most of the long-time attendees are pretty normal (except for
the 12-step stuff).  They don't bully or try to push dogma down your throat.
<p>
I don't go often anymore, but its nice once in a while because I like a few of the people
there.  They have a bad reputation (that meeting) because they don't force the cult
stuff or the &quot;feel-bad&quot; stuff down your throat.   They get criticized by people in
other groups because they are not
hard-core enough (one of the reasons why I didn't mind some of the people).  I was
very disturbed, however, when I heard that a member who I knew (and liked) was in
jail for murder. This is the link to the news<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005201/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-01/news/ct-met-toddler-murder-20130401_1_rodriguez-chicago-man-cook-county-bond-court" target="_blank">
http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-04-01/news/ct-met-toddler-murder-20130401_1_rodriguez-chicago-man-cook-county-bond-court</a>

<p>
Disturbing, isn't it?  Like somebody told me &#8212; &quot;you never know who you're sitting
next to.&quot;  Since I read about that scum, I really haven't been going to AA very much
at all.
<p>
The other night I was thinking about AA and I guess the main thing that bothers me
is once I quit drinking, I want to feel more like &quot;normal&quot; people with each day of
sobriety &#8212; but in AA you are not allowed to do that.  After I have a year sober I
don't want to say &quot;I'm an addict and an alcoholic&quot;. Terry, I want to feel good about
sobriety, not bad.  But the program really won't let you feel good, and that's why I
don't go often anymore.  The only thing good about AA is like you say, the &quot;we're
all in this together&quot; feeling.  Oh and seeing  nice-looking women, too. I enjoy
that.
<p>
Anyway thanks for the website,  I like it and its well-done, nicely organized, and
it pretty much covers just about everything (except for the AA bullies-the members
who like to make others feel bad and think it's funny-you know, the emotionally
abusive, manipulative, scumbag AAers) if you can point me to those letters or that
section of the site, I'd appreciate it.  Have a great day, its hot as hell where I'm
at.
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
RC<br>
please leave my email addr off  your site , dont use my real name, thank you. RC is
ok tho

<font color="blue">
Hello RC,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story.
Congratulations on your sobriety and I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
And you have managed to maintain your sanity, too.

<p>
About them not letting you feel good about your recovery: That is the essence of a cult.
They don't want to lose you. You have to stay &quot;sick&quot; and crippled forever, and in need of the cult,
and in the cult, forever. If they allowed you to say that you have recovered and are normal,
then you wouldn't need them.
<p>
(Likewise, they will also tell you that
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">your thinking is messed up and you can't think right</a>.
That keeps you from passing judgement on their insane nonsense.)

<p>
A.A. tries to twist things around and say that, because you should not drink any more alcohol,
that you have a lifelong disease and you desperately need their &quot;program&quot; or else you will die.
Wrong.
<p>
I, for example, have almost thirteen years of sobriety now (just 2 more months). I simply do not
drink alcohol. (And I also abstain from tobacco and any illegal drugs. The only things I'm taking
now are what my doctor gives me.)
<p>
I do not go to meetings to maintain my sobriety. I don't work a program.
I don't constantly read a &quot;spiritual&quot; book about drinking, as if it had all of the
answers to life.
The doctor doesn't give me any special pills for my &quot;alcoholism&quot;.
I just don't drink alcohol because it is bad for my health and
once I start drinking I end up drinking far too much and I get very sick. So I don't drink alcohol.

<p>
Now some Steppers try to claim that because I am no good at moderate drinking,
that I am diseased for life. Nope. I am also no good at moderating with cyanide koolaid or arsenic,
so I just don't drink the stuff.
That isn't a disease. I am not &quot;abnormal&quot;. I am actually quite normal. There are millions of people
who just don't drink alcohol because bad things happen if they do.
<p>
It's a shades-of-gray question, not an absolute black-or-white &quot;Are You An Alcoholic?&quot;

<p>
Now here, of course, is
<a href="orange-letters363.html#Bryce_S2" target="_blank">where some Stepper will complain that I am not a
&quot;real alcoholic&quot;</a>
&#8212; that if I was a Real Alcoholic that I wouldn't have been able to
quit drinking without A.A.  Wrong again.  That is just the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank"><i>Real Scotsman</i> Logical Fallacy</a> 
once again.  Everybody from my family and friends to my doctor insisted that I was an alcoholic,
before I quit drinking.
<p>
And A.A. plays a shell game with the definitions of &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
&quot;Real alcoholics&quot; cannot quit drinking, but &quot;hard drinkers&quot; can.
We were just talking about that in a previous letter, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters365.html#definitions" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters365.html#definitions</a>

<p>
Incidentally, my current doctor does not talk about my &quot;alcoholism&quot;,
not at all. He has never used the word.
At each annual check-up, his nurse interviews me first and asks the standard questions about
how much alcohol I drink. I tell her that I have been sober for
10 years, 11 years, 12 years. She nods and says &quot;good&quot; and types that into the computer.
(She also asks me about smoking, and I give her the same answer.)
And that's it. My doctor never mentioned my &quot;alcoholism&quot; or told me that I have a disease from
which I cannot recover. We talk about my real problems, like arthritis and osteoporosis and
a ruptured disk and pinched nerves.

<p>
Why make a non-problem into a problem?

<p>
By the way, if you want a group of kindred spirits who understand,
may I suggest any of the non-cult recovery groups like SMART and SOS? Here is the list of addresses:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>

Hello again, Anon3,
<p>
Okay, now I have some time to put together a proper answer. First off, thanks for that link.
I didn't know that they existed. It seems like, every day there is more of that. The world
is slowly waking up to the fact that 12-Step recovery is a hoax, and more and more people
are speaking up.

<p>
You did not say whether your girlfriend was getting brainwashed in the rehab and was
pulling away from you. We have discussed that in a recent letter, here:<br> 
<a href="orange-letters360.html#Alexander_D" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters360.html#Alexander_D</a>

<p>
And we have discussed the nightmare of having a friend or loved one in a Stepper rehab many times.
Here are a few of them:

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters134.html#horror" target="_blank">
The thing that really stuck out for me was the information about the Synanon games and
the cult that used them, and their psychopathic leader. What is really
very disturbing is that they use that very method at the main rehab
center here on O'ahu.</a>


<p><li> <a href="orange-letters184.html#horror" target="_blank">
the resident drug and alcohol counselor invited me into a quiet room where he absolutely GRILLED me over the idea that I was an alcoholic. ... Now, the kicker is that he had no degree.

My partner has just passed 5 months in a highly restrictive 12 step based
treatment center. (She has the &quot;option&quot; of staying up to a year,

&quot;suggested&quot; that she cut all ties with me.</a>

I also have a history of going to a crazy cult-like drug and alcohol rehab, when I was 27 and very desperate. I was in this place for 5 months, it was severely abusive (psychologically) and I had a mental breakdown afterwards.</a>

The counselor tried hard to get in my girlfriend's pants and recommended I leave her, his name was Chuck. The &quot;treatment&quot; they gave us was the issuance of a Big Book and meetings.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
The entire reason I would drink was to escape the pain of rejection and marginalization I received from society. The hospital and AA completely missed it, my diagnosis was always alcoholic and the cure always Alcoholics Anonymous.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters335.html#horror" target="_blank">
So into the 90-day program I went, and, deja vu
all over again, about two-thirds of the way through I learned that it wasn't really
a 90-day program, but &quot;Stage I&quot; of a year-long program...</a>

<p>
President Teddy Roosevelt was famous for the saying, &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick.&quot;
Well, a Federal Appeals Court gave us a really big stick just last week. They ruled
that any authority who coerces someone into the 12-Step religion can be sued for violation
of their Constitutional rights, and that the offender <i>must</i> pay damages. 
Paying the big bucks is not optional.
The story and the links are here:
<p>
<a href="orange-letters366.html#Michael_D" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters366.html#Michael_D</a>
<p>
Now this case was specifically about a prisoner who got sent back to prison because he refused
to participate in the 12-Step religion, but it seems like it is also applicable to people in
rehab who are pressured and coerced into 12-Step meetings by their so-called &quot;counselors&quot;
and &quot;therapists&quot; who make the fraudulent claim that the 12-Step religion
provides &quot;recovery tools&quot; and that participation in Alcoholics Anonymous
or Narcotics Anonymous is a &quot;program requirement&quot;.
Victims of so-called &quot;treatment centers&quot; are blackmailed into participation
in the 12-Step religion with the threat of getting kicked out of the program and
losing all of the money that they paid in advance for &quot;treatment&quot;.
Selling cult religion as &quot;treatment&quot; for a &quot;disease&quot; is also
quackery and criminal fraud, of course, and considering the amounts of money
involved, it is felony fraud. Those con artists really should go to prison for their crimes.

<p>
Also, Stanton Peele has a book
&quot;<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-bibliography.html#Resisting" target="_blank">Resisting 12-Step Coercion</a>&quot;,
which is now a free download on the Internet. Peele's book is mostly for people who
are sentenced to A.A. meetings by a judge or parole officer, but some ideas are still relevant,
and you can't beat the price.

Now let's see, what other &quot;tools to fight this cult&quot; are there?
Knowledge and true information are great tools &#8212; things that cults really hate. 
These may give you some helpful information:

<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
It's almost unbelievable that the most popular &quot;treatment&quot; for
&quot;the disease of alcoholism&quot; does not really work at all, but that's how it is.
There is plenty of money to be made by selling fake cures to the local yokels.

<p><li> <a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Steps Interpreted</a>.
What are those Steps, really, and what do they do?

<p><li> <a href="orange-traditions.html" target="_blank">The Twelve Traditions Interpreted</a>.
The &quot;Traditions&quot; are not traditions; they are just 12 more rules that nobody follows.

<p><li>  <a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson Writes The Steps</a>.
Where those Steps came from.

<p><li> <a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">Recruiting Mind Games</a>.
I would bet that your girlfriend is getting this stuff a lot.

<p><li> <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.
No matter what religion you favor, there is something very strange, downright heretical,
about the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous.


</ol>
<p>
Well, I guess that will do for starters. Please feel free to write back if you have more questions.
<p>
And have a good day now. And good luck.

Subject:  	AA has helped millions. You seem not so well informed<br>

<p>
God bless you you are however ignorant. All AA asks in the beginning is for
people to lay aside prejudice. It never suggests one abandon his religious
view altogether. What is true that many have died who have believed in God
yet had no access to. In no way does AA suggest you use an ashtray or a
teacup to be a Higher power. Dr Bob and Bill used to read to people out if
the bible. James played a big part in the formation of the Basic Text. I'm
certain God has no issue with AA maybe you ought to ask yourself why all
the dislike of AA. As AA states we had to quit playing God, it doesn't
work.

Hello Keith,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Actually, I am very well informed. What you have written there is a collection
of A.A. slogans that are completely untrue:
<p>
<ol>

<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA has helped millions. You seem not so well informed<br> 
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
 A.A. has not saved millions.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
 The real number is close to zero</a>.
The only people who quit drinking in A.A. are the ones who were going to quit drinking anyway.

<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">
 A.A. actually raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.


<p><li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
All AA asks in the beginning is for
people to lay aside prejudice.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

When Bill Wilson asks you to &quot;lay aside prejudice&quot;, what that means is that he want you to be gullible
and ignore the real facts and just believe his lies.
Bill Wilson routinely labeled critical thinking &quot;prejudice&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We found that as soon as we were able to lay
aside prejudice and express even a willingness to
believe in a Power greater than ourselves, we
commenced to get results, even though it was
impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend
that Power, which is God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions, William G. Wilson, Page 46.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
We commenced to get what results?
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#results" target="_blank">More on that here</a>.

</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
Wrong.
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">
 All of Chapter 4 of the Big Book, &quot;We Agnostics&quot;</a>,
is a lecture that says that we must all convert to believing in Bill Wilson's religion.
<p>
Then the Hazelden Foundation propaganda instructs us to give up our own religion and just
believe in the A.A. religion:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;... Alcoholics Anonymous is a spiritual program, not a
religious one.&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
&quot;Ideally,&quot; Jerry added, &quot;religion helps you achieve
spirituality, but if it doesn't, then set it aside for a
while.&quot;<br>

<p><li>
This is nonsense:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
What is true that many have died who have believed in God yet had no access to.<br>

<p> 
Had no access to what?


<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In no way does AA suggest you use an ashtray or a teacup to be a Higher power.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
Now you are just <i>In Denial</i>. <b>Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.</b>

A.A. members have told me that my &quot;Higher Power&quot; can be anything from a
<a href="orange-letters13.html#doorknob" target="_blank">doorknob</a>
to a
<a href="orange-heresy.html#cat" target="_blank">cat</a>
or a
<a href="orange-letters205.html#parakeet" target="_blank">parakeet</a>.

<p><li>

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Dr Bob and Bill used to read to people out if the bible.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
Dr. Bob was a Bible-beater. Bill Wilson was not.

<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
James played a big part in the formation of the Basic Text.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
Wrong. Dr. Frank Buchman and his Oxford Group used one line out of the Book of James, and claimed
that it justified their practice of group confessions:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Confess <i>your</i> faults one to another and pray one for another,
that ye may be healed. The effective fervent prayer of a righteous man
availeth much.&quot;<br>
</font>
== James 5:16
</blockquote>
<p>
James said &quot;ONE to ANOTHER&quot;, not &quot;one to a group&quot;.  
<a href="orange-heresy.html#confessions" target="_blank">
The early Christian church did practice group confessions, but they found that it was a huge
mistake because it increased the sinning</a>.  
When the children heard what the adults were doing,
they thought they might like to try that too.
And the old people were offended by frank sexual confessions.
Soon, the Church banned public confessions as a big mistake.
Bill Wilson just copied Frank Buchman's mistake.


<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I'm certain God has no issue with AA <br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
You are certain, huh? It must be wonderful to know the mind of God so well. Does God talk to you
in your daily Step 11 s&eacute;ances and tell you how He feels about things?
<p>
You  should read the file <a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>
to see how God might have issues with the A.A. theology.
<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 maybe you ought to ask yourself why all the dislike of AA.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
Oh I have. And the answer that I come up with is, it is really disgusting,
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="_blank">watching child-rapers yammering cult slogans to sick people</a>
 as if those slogans were real wisdom that would actually
heal people.
And to think that those perverts get paid our tax money for doing it... Unbelievable.

<p><li>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As AA states we had to quit playing God, it doesn't work.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 
That is another one of those crazy brain-damaged A.A. slogans.
Bill Wilson insisted that everybody had to be an obedient slave of God, listening to God in
Step 11 s&eacute;ances and getting work orders.  Bill Wilson denounced thinking for yourself as
 &quot;Playing God&quot;.
Deciding for yourself what is right or wrong is &quot;playing God&quot;.
No it isn't. It's being a grown-up.

<p>
They are not my facts. My expereince is that it works WHAT would I benefit
from reading your opinions? I jnow what has worked in my life and in
countless others lives. I have read enough of your &quot;facts&quot; or rather
opinions to be quite comfortable that I need to read no further.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Keith,
<p>
Actually, &quot;your experience&quot; seems to be that you have quit drinking. (At least, you are inferring
that you quit drinking, although you did not actually say that you did, or how long you have
been sober.)
<p>
 At the same time, you did a number
of other things, like eat better, sleep, walk, work, travel, take a bath or shower, get dressed,
brush your teeth.  Any one of those things could have contributed to your sobriety, or none of
them may have.  You cannot infer a cause-and-effect connection just from quitting drinking and also
doing something else, like going to some meetings,  or joining a particular religion,
or eating a particular food, or even taking some drug.
Believing that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between things that happen at the same time
is the logical fallacy of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>.
<p>
The truth is, you decided to quit drinking, so you did.
<br>
At the same time, you also went to some meetings because somebody told you that the meetings make
people quit drinking, or &quot;help&quot; them, which isn't true. At those meetings, people told you
a bunch of lies, and you believed them.

<p>
You have not really figured out why you quit drinking. It certainly was not because you
did the practices of an old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties, confessing your sins and
imagining that you were hearing the Voice of God in s&eacute;ances. What was the real cause
for your decision to quit drinking?
  Was it,
<ul>
<li> Got arrested?
<li> Got very sick?
<li> Wife left you?
<li> Lost job, and then became homeless?
<li> Doctor said you were going to die?  
<li> The total suffering just got to be too much?
</ul>
</font>
<p>
Where would you send a dear friend if he was literally dying from
alcoholism and no treatment seemed to help? This ought to be telling!

<p>
<font color="blue">
If he was really a dear friend, then I would not just &quot;send him&quot; somewhere,
I would stay with him and take him to a variety of places and things, starting
with SMART and SOS and Lifering. Here is the list of better organizations:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>
<p>
I would also read this letter to him:

<p>
Have a good day now.
