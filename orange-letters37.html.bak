<p>

Why the hell would you put down something that is working for many
people.  You don't know what you are talking about and it is a damn
shame that you are attempting to turn people in need of recovery away
from something that can work for them.  Are you an addict/alcoholic?  If
it didn't work for you then you don't want to get better.  Do you have
God in your life?  Silly question I know.  Of course you don't,
otherwise you wouldn't be so angry and evil.  You know what makes me mad
about the God that I love?  It is that he loves even you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tammy,
<p>
You know, there is getting to be quite an echo around here. Your letter
is simply a repetition of so many things that other Steppers have
parrotted over and over again. There isn't an original word in the whole mess.

<ul>
<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
Why the hell would you put down something that is working for many
people.
</i></font><br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">
It does not work</a>. The claim that A.A. works great and has sobered up
millions of alcoholics is
<a href="orange-aalies.html">the Big Lie of Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
You don't know what you are talking about and it is a damn
shame that you are attempting to turn people in need of recovery away
from something that can work for them.
</i></font><br>
I do know what I am talking about. Read the web site. You could start by
just reading
<a href="orange-bibliography.html">the bibliography</a>
to see where I get my information.

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
Are you an addict/alcoholic?
</i></font><br>
Yes, and no. It depends on your definition of those terms.
<a href="orange-letters15.html#alcoholic_definitions_2">Read these definitions</a>
and the answers.

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
If it didn't work for you then you don't want to get better.
</i></font><br>
Wrong again. What &quot;IT&quot; are you talking about?
What supposedly works?
We just discussed that question
<a href="orange-letters36.html#what_IT">in a previous letter, here</a>.
<p>
I didn't try to use cult religion for my salvation.
I pretty quickly figured out what A.A. and N.A. were, and used my own intelligence
and common sense and will power, and I quit my own way.
I have 5 years of sobriety now, so MY PROGRAM is working just fine, thank you.
<ul>
<li>
Notice how you claim that any cases where A.A. doesn't work are the fault of the
alcoholic. The A.A. program is never to blame, never responsible for any failures.<br>
<li>
But if a person gets sober while attending some A.A. meetings, then A.A. claims the
full credit for the guy's sobriety. Suddenly they say that A.A. really is
responsible for the situation.<br>
<li>
Well, you can't have it both ways.
</ul>

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
Do you have
God in your life?  Silly question I know.  Of course you don't,
otherwise you wouldn't be so angry and evil.
</i></font><br>
It is actually none of your business what my religious beliefs are. You are proving
that A.A. really is a cult.
<p>
How or why would my religious beliefs have anything to do with the success rate
of the A.A. quit-drinking program?

<p>
Whenever someone disagreed with Bill Wilson, he accused them of being
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik">an agnostic or an atheist</a>.
You are doing the same thing.
That is also just another repetition of the standard propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>ad hominem</i></a>.
<p>
But just for the heck of it, I will tell you that I am neither an agnostic nor
an atheist. For a greater understanding of my religious beliefs, you should read
the file
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
You know what makes me mad about the God that I love?  It is that he loves even you.
</i></font><br>
Wow. Are you saying that God goofed? So you are mad about God's behavior?
<p>
How does that jive with the remarks you just made about
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Do you have God in your life?  Silly question I know.  Of course you don't,
otherwise you wouldn't be so angry and evil.&quot;
</i></font>
</ul>


<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Our Deepest Fear...from a speech by Nelson Mandela

<p>

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that
we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that
most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you /not/ to be? You are a child
of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing
enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure
around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to
make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some
of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we
unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are
liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

<p>

Dear Secret Agent Orange
<p>
Why am I writng to you ?
persuation?appeal?or retort? --not at all --by this time u must hv known
that AA cannot afford a contravesy--it is very very intoxicating .I hv
no intention of oblivion--&amp;therfore will abide by AA philosophy of no
opininion on outside issue including contraversy by an outsider on
AAitself !
<p>
we all AAs know  that athesist/beliver is non issue' --Bill was not
angel or saint but &quot;exraordinarily ordinary&quot;--nocult or any cult we hv
no problems--negative groowth? but we r not organised to do reasearch or
maintain statstics to negate --actually we dont intend to negate ---&quot;As
Bill says&quot; we want the best or even the worst to come out ---to
reiterate the basic faith of average AA member that AA has saved our
life.We believe that this life saving fellowship is much dependent on
the personally experienced priciples than any personality be it Orange
or Bill himself!----Is AA gender baised --no opinion---Is ths eastwhile
3 legacy symbol was good for jewelry --we dont know it is no more our
symbol!!----
<p>
In the city of Thane where I live near Mumbai --India we AAs discussed
your website --&amp;I AM GREATFULLY OBLIGED TO INFORM YOU THAT ALL OF  US
FELT  THE SAME ---------AA has saved our life which no body could do
earlier &amp;we have no opinion on your views ---with best regards----

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Satish,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Unfortunately, I have to disagree with just about every line of your letter.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
To say that
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;AA cannot afford a contravesy &#8212; it is very very intoxicating&quot;
</i></font>
is nonsense. That is just a standard cultish demand that nobody dissent or
disagree with the cult. Everybody has to parrot the party line.

<p><li>
You say,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;we all AAs know  that athesist/beliver is non issue&quot;.
</i></font><br>

Oh no it isn't. It is a very big issue.
<a href="orange-letters37.html#no_God">I just got another letter</a>
from another
true believer who accused me of &quot;not having a God&quot; because I criticized
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Now I know about all of the talk about how you can have any beliefs that you want.
That is just
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education">the standard A.A. bait-and-switch trick</a>
that alternates between
saying that you have complete religious freedom, and then demanding that you 
believe what Bill Wilson believed (or else the program won't work and you will die).

<p><li>
You wrote:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;negative groowth? but we r not organised to do reasearch or
maintain statstics to negate --actually we dont intend to negate.
Bill says&quot; we want the best or even the worst to come out ---to
reiterate the basic faith of average AA member that AA has saved our
life.&quot; 
</i></font><br>
Then how could you possibly claim that the A.A. program works?
You can't possibly know what you are talking about if you don't have any accurate numbers.
<p>
And it doesn't matter how much &quot;faith&quot; someone has that the A.A. program works.
That is misplaced faith. Have faith in Jesus or Krishna or Buddha or Mohammed,
but don't have faith in &quot;a program&quot; &#8212; especially not one that came from
<a href="orange-rroot060.html">a crazy American fascist cult leader</a>.

<p><li>
Again, you wrote:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;We believe that this life saving fellowship is much dependent on
the personally experienced priciples than any personality be it Orange
or Bill himself!&quot;
</i></font><br>
Again, beliefs are not facts.
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_belief_truth">Belief does not equal truth</a>.
<p>
A.A. is not &quot;a life-saving fellowship&quot;. It is a cult religion that has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">a terrible failure
rate at sobering up alcoholics</a>.
<p>
I know that you already said that you are not organized enough to keep records or
collect data on the success rate of Alcoholics Anonymous, so you can't answer this
question:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is your success rate? Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A. who come seeking some kind
of help or advice for quitting drinking, how many of them become successful sober
10-year old-timers?
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But if you could answer that question, then you could tell me why you believe that A.A.
is a &quot;life-saving fellowship&quot;. Since you can't answer that question,
you have no evidence that A.A.  actually works to help anyone quit drinking.
<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;we AAs discussed
your website --&amp;I AM GREATFULLY OBLIGED TO INFORM YOU THAT ALL OF  US
FELT  THE SAME&quot;
</i></font><br>

Well of course you did. That is one of the requirements for a cult.
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_group_think">You have to all uniformly believe in it</a>.
No independent thinking is allowed.
No questioning of the cult is allowed.
No dissent is allowed.

</ul>
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

1) AA IS THE ONLY FELLOWSHIP WHICH HAS WONDERFULLY UNIFIED INDIVIDUAL

That is just the standard cultish claim that
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">our group is special, really special</a>,
much better than all of the other cults.
<p>
And the talk about individual freedom is absurd. The slogans are,
<ul>
<li> &quot;Work the Steps, Or Die!&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;If you don't work a Fourth you'll drink a fifth.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Stop Your Stinkin' Thinkin'.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;When we think we are in control of our own lives we are living in denial.&quot;<br>

<li> &quot;This is a program of rigorous honesty.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Fake it until you make it.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Act As If...&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;You can act yourself into thinking right easier than you can think yourself into acting right.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Don't let <i>anything</i> get in front of your recovery.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;You must be willing to go to <i>any length</i> for your sobriety.&quot;<br>

<li> &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up, and Learn Something.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Listen and Learn.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Quitting isn't an option for addicts like us.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;There aren't any 'musts' in this program, but there are a lot of 'you betters'.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Unless each AA member follows to the best of his ability our suggested Twelve Steps of recovery, he almost certainly signs his own death warrant. <font color="#9F0000">We must obey</font> certain principles or we die.&quot;

Apparently, you have not bothered to read either
the fourth chapter of the <i>Big Book</i>,

Date:  	Fri, February 10, 2006<br>
From:  	&quot;Josie&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Treatment story<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,
<p>
Thank you for your website. It helped me tremendously during a dreadful
period in my life. You asked for 12-step treatment horror stories. Here
is mine:
<p>
I was in AA for about 4 years. Married someone in the program. We
stopped going to meetings but didn't drink. We had two beautiful
daughters. The marriage went bad and I became very depressed at the
thought of divorce, went into therapy and on medication, which totally
screwed me up. After a year of this and on the way to my Dad's funeral,
I had a drink and for some time thereafter continued to drink in
moderation. My husband started to go to meetings again, practically
moved into the AA-club. Granted, it must have been very difficult for
him to watch me have a drink. Both his parents were alcoholics and he
practically grew up in AA. His mother died when he was 9 and his Dad
relapsed.  He's had some truly hair-raising experiences while his
father abused alcohol and no kid should have to go through what he had
to. On the other hand, my family's attitude towards alcohol was very
relaxed and a glass or two or three were a normal and enjoyable part of
life.
<p>
I traveled for a living and while I was gone the husband would take the
girls with him to the club. They would not bathe or brush their hair
until I came home. They were late to school or would stay out
altogether because Dad had to be at the eleven o'clock meeting every
night and then they had to go out for coffee afterward. Four days a
week while I was home they were loved and doted on, three days of it
were devoted to their father's wants and needs. The marital
difficulties now got blamed on my 'drinking'. His total lack of care or
concern, combined with my medicated depression and the lack of sleep
and an overabundance of jet lag, made me swallow a handful of over the
counter sleeping pills one night. Immediately realizing my error, I
vomited everything up but he made a big fuss and woke up the girls. I
had to go to the emergency room.  Although I felt fine (the whole thing
was very cathargic actually) I went along. From the ER I had to go to
the psychiatric ward at a treatment center. Just wanting to get the
hell out of this nightmare I finally agreed that yes, it was entirely
my fault, yes I should stop drinking and give AA another go in order to
save my marriage. I committed to treatment on an outpatient basis and
was able to work my regular schedule.
<p>
I desperately wanted to stop taking the meds but instead was given a
higher dosage as well as some others to counterbalance the effects of
the first. I was told I was in denial about being an alcoholic, that I
wanted to blame everything on the pills. So I shut up and went to
meetings. My fellow AA-members ridiculed my 16 years of sobriety. I'd
just been a dry drunk. One woman laughed when I shared about my
half-assed suicide attempt. Right away I remembered why I'd left the
first time around. Back at home I got more AA-bullcrap thrown at me.
The husband felt victorious, I'd admitted defeat and he was the good
guy with 17 years of sobriety. The girls were fully indoctrinated by
now. What had been a bad marriage became intolerable. Financially we
were spinning out of control thanks to a business he had started a few
years earlier, which drained all my hard earned money. I told him to
leave and he finally did. The relief was wonderful! Life immediately
became so much better. I decided to experiment with alcohol because I
was not at all convinced that I had a problem with it. For the first
time in years I really enjoyed life again.
<p>
The husband rented a gigantic warehouse that he was going to transform
into a 'babe-magnet'. He shared it with other people from the program
who were down on their luck, vagabonds and strippers, etc. It was an
hour's drive to the girls' school and they were absent more and more
often. One day a member from the school board came to my door to
inquire. The school counselor had been told that Mom was a practicing
alcoholic, which of course explained the fact that the girls appeared
unkempt and neglected. Never mind the fact that I lived within a mile
of the school and they were always on time on my watch, as well as
clean, well fed and rested. The Department of Family and Children's
Services became involved and demanded that I not drink and go to
AA-meetings if I were to keep my kids. When I told them to investigate
living conditions over at their Dad's they shrugged it off &#8212; he didn't
drink. Back in the program again! Things didn't improve no matter that
I stayed sober and went to a meeting every day, so the DFCS counselor
decided I was lying about not drinking. She yelled at me that she knew
'you sick alcoholics. You'll lie about anything!' Dad was sitting there
listening to it, relishing it.
<p>
My eldest daughter at ten years old decided that she didn't have to
take me seriously anymore and refused to do her chores. She said I was
an obsessive-compulsive about keeping the house clean, which is a real
joke, but when you compared it to the pigsty 'babe-magnet' then yeah.
One time when I came to pick the girls up from his place there was dog
poop all over the floor as well as a dead kitten that had been mauled
by the dogs. There was trash everywhere. But hey, he was not drinking!
<p>
Around this time I became involved with a man in AA, a relationship
that was much frowned upon by the other members because I 'ain't from
'round here' and was also openly questioning the principles of the
program. He broke up with me right before Thankgiving dinner.

<p>
All this
stuff made me severly depressed again and I was put on more medication.
Unable to sleep for nights on end and stressed out beyond belief I
began having panic attacks and soon was unable to function. The
medication made me shake and tremble so that everybody figured I was
drinking pretty badly, when in fact I'd been stone-cold sober for
months.
<p>
<a name="shunned"> </a>
<a name="suicide"> </a>
Seeing this man at every meeting, in spite of our agreement not
to go to the same meetings, made things worse. I was shunned by him and
everybody else. Three women from that AA-group had committed suicide in
as many months, but nobody questioned themselves or the group, let
alone the program. (On 9/11 the leader of the meeting suggested
'gratitude' as a topic, so I raised my hand and asked to please address
what surely was on everyone's mind: the horror of what had just
happened. The reply was that it was political and 'we come here to get
away from all that kinda stuff'. Talk about denial!)
<p>
One morning my daughter had a tantrum because I told her to do one of
her (very few) regular chores, she called her father and asked him to
pick her up because 'Mom's being crazy'. He glared at me very
self-righteously as he took my girls away. Good Dad. Bad Mom.
<p>
In AA they say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing
over and over again, expecting different results, but I came to find
out that insanity comes when reality as you know it gets turned upside
down and inside out &#8212; when good is bad and bad is good, when normal is
crazy and crazy is normal. Having failed at everything (i.e. curing my
depression, saving my marriage, being a Mom, etc) I just lost the point
of it all. I felt truly insane. But, I didn't drink! I was a total
wreck and I knew I needed to get off the damned pills but I was afraid
to stop taking them. If I was depressed now, how would it be without
medication? Without my kids and very miserable and confused I didn't
see any point in not drinking, so I picked up a carton of beer and
called up the Employee Assistance Program at my work and said I needed
to get treatment. The treatment center at first didn't want to take me
in because my blood alcohol level wasn't high enough, but then did
anyway.
<p>
So now I was back in treatment (inpatient this time around) to get this
horrible mess over with. I was fanatical about it all, wanting to be a
model student, wanting to get everything right this time. When I went
to see the doctor though he said that my dosage of medication wasn't
nearly high enough if I still suffered from depression and that I could
safely go to almost twice that. I protested that I wanted to quit, or
at least taper down; that my mental health and overall efficiency had
greatly suffered throughout the course and that I was in danger of
losing my job because of frequent medical absences. He smiled
indulgently and handed me the prescription. When I expressed my wishes
about psychotherapy he said that all I needed was AA; that there was
nothing wrong with me that AA couldn't cure. I told him that I'd been
in AA for years and that I'd been sober for 16 years; that I was not in
denial and that perhaps I wasn't your typical case. That of course did
it. Not your typical case, haha. From that moment on he avoided me like
the plague, only calling on me in class to show the others that I was a
classic example of relapse due to an AA-less existence. By the time I
got discharged (against my wishes because I felt not ready at all), I
was on 4 different medications but they negelected to give me a
prescription for them. Wanting to get off meds anyway I let it ride but
after 3 days I went through excruciating withdrawals and had a helluva
time getting the pills I was obviously addicted to. Funny, coming out
of a treatment center.
<p>
I became a wreck: unable to leave my house,
shaking violently. I remember sitting at the kitchen table like a
zombie, drifting in and out of consciousness, not knowing if seconds or
hours or days had passed by. Luckily I had forced accumulated vacation
time. I went back to the treatment center for a follow-up and told the
physician what was going on.  He said I was at the maximum dose but
that there were other meds to straighten things out. I frantically
urged him to please see about reducing my meds. He said no way.
<p>
After 2 weeks I saw him again. I'd lost a considerable amont of weight,
for which he actually complimented me. (At 5'7' and 125 lbs I had no
reason to want to shed 20 lbs.) He was annoyed that I hadn't been
working and said it was 'suspicious' that I had vacation time right
after coming out of treatment. As if I'd plannned any of it! Out of my
fog I told him that I hadn't been able to function at all and to please
look at the medication I was taking. He laughed and said I was alright
and that I better not pretend otherwise and he dismissed me like that.
<p>
I called the EAP person and told her that I had been blown off and to
please refer me to another doctor. She said that was impossible and
that without a note from this guy I would be unable to stay out. He
responded to the company that my 'treatment' had been successful and
that there was no reason I should not return to work. This doctor had
seen me privately for less than 10 minutes over a 3-week period, he
messed me up with more drugs and then he declared me well and that was
all there was to it.
<p>
I'd had 12 years with this company and I lost my job.
How's that for treatment?
<p>

Subject:  	What you make occur for other's will naturally occur for you<br>

<p>

At least Alcoholic's Anonymous got one thing proper; through helping
other alcoholic's/addict's recover such has caused me to stay sober
while aiding other's through recovery.

<p>
This principle doing unto other's in order to receive in return is
nothing new although such is foundation of the 12 step.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Brian,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Well, to start with, A.A. does not help alcoholics to get and stay sober.
A.A. is just a cult that steals the credit for other people's hard work to
quit and save their own lives.
<p>
A.A. merely recruits those who just quit drinking, or who are about to.
Then A.A. says that it &quot;made them quit drinking&quot;, or
&quot;helped them to quit drinking&quot;.
Bill Wilson, the founder of A.A., described the recruiting process
this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;As a matter of fact, the successful worker [A.A. recruiter]
differs from the unsuccessful one only in being lucky about
his prospects. He simply hits cases who are ready and able
to stop at once.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, quoted in <i>'PASS IT ON',
The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached
the world</i>, page 252.
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>


I however did not use these 12 steps through my recovery although
provide truths that free one another from cravings; although
intelligence is the name of the game.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is pretty incomprehensible.
</font>
<p>

Nobody intellectually minded, which applies wisdom throughout their
lives, will ever use mood and mind altering substances as a way out of
or through escape of their very own problems.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#pseudo_intellectual">pseudo-intellectual bull</a>
&#8212; just grand-sounding sweeping declarations supported by no facts.
The truth is, intellectuals, doctors, priests and ministers all fall victim
to alcoholism and drug addictions. If anything, intellectuals, artists,
and such people suffer slightly greater addiction rates than the
&quot;regular people&quot;.
</font>
<p>

Solve the livelihood problems there with wisdom while truths become
intellectual knowledge; which is powerful stuff, therewith you empower
rather than de-thrown.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is incomprehensible nonsense.
</font>
<p>

A head start for alcoholic's/addicts to gain the freedom from cravings
(ignorance) can be gotten through reading: &quot;Total Freedom&quot; by J.
Krishnamurti, as well as: &quot;Seat of the Soul&quot;, and &quot;Heart of the Soul&quot; by
Gary Zukav. All of which destroy ignorance, along with empowering
provocative truth.

<p>
<font color="blue">
While reading the philosophy of the East is a good thing, &quot;ignorance&quot; is not the same
thing as feeling bad and craving drugs that might make one feel better.
That is what you call a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#false_equality">False Equality</a>.
</font>

<p>
No one person should ever be without these minimal prevocational words.
Such heals more than one would expect. Partly philosophical but
undeniably certain to give one the edge regarding dissention(s).

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is more gibberish. What do you mean by &quot;prevocational&quot;?
The Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary defines it as
&quot;pertaining to, or constituting preliminary vocational training&quot;.

</font>
<p>

Too much stated about these wonderful works shall merely do injustice
for truth speaks for itself, while standing on its very own face value
where non shall dissent upon knowing these comprehensibly...
<p>
sincerely<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is simply too garbled to respond to.<br>

From:  	&quot;Matt M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Hi<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

(please accept my advanced apologies for any rough language I may use.....)

<p>

Hopefully one day I will find out your real name.  I have been off the
booze since 9/10/93 and like you was never comfortable with the whole
demeaning process of AA where they stripped your self esteem down to
nothing in order to &quot;build you up.&quot;  There was some goofy slogan or
cliche behind that but since I've been away from AA for over 1 1/2 years
now, I completely forgot what it was.  Maybe that is a good thing since
it all looks stupid now.  If that makes me a &quot;dry drunk&quot; in the eyes of
AA, so be it.  They can get together in their little meetings, carp
about how they are &quot;living in the moment,&quot; and profess their fatalistic
prophecies about being &quot;one drink away from death.&quot;  Today, I have no
time for such claptrp and found other avenues that are far more
productive than sitting with a bunch of neer do wells.  In essence I
discovered life and got one.

<p>

When I went to my 1st AA meeting, I had this mousy looking fuck named
Jason who told me he loved me &quot;but your stinking thinks and you don't
love yourself.&quot;  What a wonderful fucking thing to tell a newcomer.
Makes me want to &quot;keep coming back.&quot;  Anyway,  he was a charming as PT
Barnum and at the time I fell for it hook, line, and sinker and so he
appointed himself to be &quot;my sponsor.&quot;  Kind of like how Pol Pot and the
Khmer Rouge were able to seduce the masses of Cambodia back in 1975 into
thinking that an agrarian society and Communist economic philosophy
were going to be the best thing for their country.  And if you saw the
movie &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; or have studied the history of Southeast
Asia, you know (in the words of Paul Harvey) what &quot;the rest of the
story&quot; is.

<p>

AA, with the aid of the American legal system and our tax dollars, is
doing the same thing compelling alcoholic offenders in forced
conscription to a failed treatment program.  It appalls me that we have
the choice in this country to choose our own health care provider,  the
car we drive,  the religion we wish to follow, the career we want to
choose, the college we want to attend, et al.  But if we get busted for
a DWI, we have no choice in choosing the type of treatment we want for
our alcohol/drug problem /*if we deem we have one*/.  That being said,
our treatment facilities have been force fed the tenets of Bill Wilson,
the greatest American con artist since PT Barnum (at least Barnum had an
entertaining product in the circus), and his 12 step program.
The Minnesota Model alcohol assessment is so fucking biased in its
questioning that anyone can be an alcoholic who answers their skewed
questioning.  Where is the choice in treatment options and how widely
available are they?  In this capitalist society (if we still are one),
it doesn't exist.  Either go to AA or go to jail is there mantra.

<p>

OK, I ranted from my libertarian soap box long enough and you may have
guessed that I am a libertarian based upon my last paragraph.  One of my
favorite quotes that I live by today is from Thomas Jefferson.  And I quote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I have sworn, before the altar of God, eternal hostility against any
form of tyranny over the mind of man.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I get shivers whenever I visit the Jefferson Memorial and see that quote
underneath the rotunda.

<p>

OK, back to the purpose of my letter.  I would love to share stories
with you about unsolicited medical advice given by AAers concerning
antidepressants, non alcoholic beer (try Kaliber from Guiness... it's
awesome!), and other goofy shit I have heard from the speaker dais
at meetings that I used to attend.  I can also tell you stories about
AAers that speak from both sides of their mouth (or ass depending upon
your view) who tell their sponsees not to get involved in relationships
for their 1st year and then end up porking some newcomer female with 2
months clean time. And how they deal with racism inside the halls (AA
response: &quot;Let it Go and Let God&quot; and &quot;what was your part?&quot;) At this
point, I am saying fuck anonymity because I am going to be dropping
names like a pigeon drops /guano/ (shit) on unsuspecting al fresco
diners at Spago.   But right now, I am suffering from writer's block and
would like to continue a dialogue with you.

<p>

In all fairness, I have met some good people in AA.  While I believe
they are good in nature, their thinking has been twisted by some zealots
who threaten intimidation if they dissent with the party line.  (You
know, &quot;If you leave AA you'll drink again and die.&quot;) One of the
wonderful things about this nation is our God given right to dissent
with thse we don't agree with.  If we didn't have the ability to reason
or think, we would be monolithic robots droning through life.  The AA
meetings I've been to seem to be a lot like that.  I am happy to say
that since I sobered up,  I have a great job with the largest financial
institution in the world, have a wonderful wife who was chased out of AA
for her Wiccan beliefs and her refusal to say the Lord's Prayer, found
some serenity and happiness in cooking Thai food in my leisure time,
and spending time with my 4 year old daughter.  In essence, I was given
the power to rediscover life because I have the ability to reason and
think for myself.  Whether you believe in God, Buddha (whose teachings I
follow), or whatever Wicca believes (my wife knows more than I and I'm
learning more about it everyday), we are blessed with certain gifts and
have the power to use those gifts to make ourselves happy.

<p>

Keep up the good work and hopefully I will get to know your real
name.  Feel free to use mine anytime.

<p>

Best Wishes,

<p>

From:  	&quot;william n.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	You're On the Money<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,
<p>
What a great website. All I can say is &quot;thank you&quot; for
providing an alternative viewpoint. I've had my doubts
about the &quot;fellowship&quot; for a long time, but since I've
been foisted into it by the court system, I've had to
pretty much stuff them and fall in line.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi William,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks.
</font>
<p>

A few things in particular really gall me about AA.
One is the absolute vacuum about its non-success rate.
What a crime.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Indeed. If it works so good, then why won't they say precisely how good it works?
</font>
<p>

<a name="halfway"> </a>
Do you mean to tell me there has been at
least an equal, if not greater chance I would've
gotten sober by just doing it on my own? Jesus, to
think of the years of time and aggravation I've spent
in the rooms. Also, at one time I was sentenced to a
halfway house in lieu of jail time &#8212; I spent 14 months
at this halfway house, which of course, was an
AA/12-step training facility.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I get so pissed when I think of all the crap I had to
convince myself that I was in order to comply with the
program:

<p>
<blockquote>
my thinking was &quot;stinking;&quot; I was self-centered (&quot;in
the extreme&quot;); I had nothing to offer anyone, i.e. sit
down, shut up, put the cotton in your mouth; I was
morally bankrupt; I was god-less, and on and on.
</blockquote>

<p>

And of course the more you fought, objected to, or
denied these things, the &quot;sicker&quot; you were &#8212; and the
more it &quot;proved&quot; you needed them. As you pointed out,
it's like the Red Chinese brainwashing system. It was
impossible for me to get any satisfaction within that
closed system of reasoning. And deep down I just knew
I had to be the one, alone, to overcome the drinking,
but god help you if you ventured that in a meeting.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yep, it's the witch test.
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#double_bind">A double-bind</a>.<br>
If you confess to being a witch, then you are one.<br>
If you deny being a witch, then that just proves that you are an evil liar
who won't even tell the truth about being a witch.
</font>
<p>

I also resent (yes, RESENT) the so-called fellowship
of AA. I think it's a load of shit. I'm a pretty
decent friendly chap, I think, but for some reason I
was never invited to be part of the &quot;inner rings&quot; of
the AA groups I attended. Those people were the lucky
ones always meeting for lunch or going to the diner,
doing social things. I dearly wanted to make some
friends and do that.  I can't tell you then number of
people I've called on my phone list and never got
called back. I think it has something to do with my
looks or my weight. (I'm over weight, what do want
from me?)  I'm not obese or anything, but I feel it
prevented me from being invited anywhere. That was
something that really really hurt me. I even talked
about it at meetings (with the &quot;blessing&quot; of my
sponsor &#8212; what a mistake) but once you do that, other
AA'ers think you're a loser. So that cemented my
outcast position.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I had the same problem too &#8212; I was never even close to the inner circle either &#8212;
but I think the real reason is that the
true believers know &#8212; they can feel it in their guts &#8212; who is a real
giddy mindless true believer and who doesn't believe in Bill's Bull.
<p>
If you are still thinking for yourself and are skeptical of the obviously
untrue dogma in the <i>Big Book</i>, and don't enthusiastically endorse
the nonsense you hear in meetings, then you are one of the faithless unbelievers.
<p>

And they fear and
avoid the unbelievers, because they are afraid that you might contaminate
them with doubts and make them relapse and then they will die drunk.
</font>
<p>

I was told to try other meetings but since I don't
have a license (DWI) I have to stick to the local ones
that I can walk to. What a drag. I've been to enough
meeting over the past 13 years to know it's not just
the people at this particular meeting; it's the whole
social-club &quot;A-List&quot; scene at these meetings. It's
ridiculous. If you're taught to believe &quot;we'll love
you even if you can't love yourself,&quot; and then those
very people reject you, don't call you back, don't ask
you to do things with them? well, no wonder people
leave and maybe even relapse.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The more I think about it, the more I think that the slogan about
&quot;Let us love you until you can love yourself&quot; is just a condescending
put-down, just another game of spiritual one-upmanship.
It's just another way of telling people that they are inferior and messed up.
That isn't love at all.
</font>
<p>

After some serious reflection and after stumbling on
your website, I realize I don't want to hang out with
those people. They're really a bunch of sophmoric,
programmed non-thinkers who have ceded their
personalities and brains to this crazy cult, and
frankly I don't need it. The AA &quot;success rate&quot; has got
to be the biggest scam perpetrated on the public and
society. I really wish the failure rate could be
broadcast for public scrutiny.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Me too. And you know, the Internet kind of works. Word is getting around.
My bandwidth usage is climbing sharply, so somebody is reading this web site.
In just the last 3 months, the downloading (page viewing) has gone from 14 gigabytes
to 18 to 22.
<p>
It's a long, slow, hard battle, but we are winning.
Those of us who are working to get the truth out are doing very well, considering
that A.A. has a 70-year head start in spreading its stories. 
</font>
<p>

I personally think the advent of the AA 12-Step
program was the beginning of the &quot;I am not responsible
for my actions&quot; sickness that has invaded all areas of
our society, including the courts, the education
system, etc. I think there would be no Oprah or Phil
if not for AA, that's for sure. If you stop and
reflect on how this philosophy has infiltrated our
very core as a society, with all its far reaching
tentacles and all its ramifications in almost every
public arena, you have to stop and catch you breath ?
that?s how sinister this has become.


<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, for sure. Stanton Peele called it &quot;The Diseasing of America&quot;.
No matter what they do, everybody has a disease.
It's really funny how A.A. talks about spirituality and morality and individual responsibility,
and then promotes just the opposite.
(Ah, but
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_hypocrisy">hypocrisy</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_denial">reversal of reality</a>
is what cults do. It's practically a hall-mark

Anyway, keep up
the good work. I look forward to reading more of your

P.S. I had to crack up when I read one of your
letters: You were giving one of your Australian fans
<a href="orange-letters15.html#kangaroo">some bullet point suggestions</a>
about what to do with
his time in lieu of going to meetings and one of them
was, &quot;You could tie me kangaroo down, mate...&quot; Those
of us of a certain vintage remember that tune. Really
cracked me up. Thanks for the laughs and the great
info.

Date:  	Mon, February 13, 2006<br>
From:  	&quot;Mvega&quot; 

<p>
Hi Orange!

<p>
I've sent you e-mail in the past.
<p>
Yesterday was Sunday Feb 12. The last time I had gone to a meeting was
awhile back. When I sent you that other e-mail (I think it was Dec
23-24/05) I had not gone to a meeting then in about 3 weeks to a
month.... I can't recall exactly.
<p>
Well, I haven't gone to one still (now Feb 12/06). That is until yesturday!
I had decided to go just to see something. Just to prove to myself
something that I already knew. I don't know why I went really, nothing
has changed.
<p>
The people that were there, were the same ones as before, with the
exception of a newcomer. I had not seen him before.
<p>
The same people from before, had <i>the same problems</i> that they had, I
mean word for word was said <i>exactly verbatum as before!</i> NOTHING had
changed for them!
<p>
I was told when I had gone to rehab that meetings were there to help me
grow! What a load of crap! You see, it wasn't that one or maybe two
people hadn't changed.
<p>
There were about 14 there. None of the 14 people had shown any growth!
<p>
We sat there for the 40-45 minute discussion and the same topics were
brought up since the last time I was there.
<p>
Topics being, <i>Step 1, Gratitude, Resentments</i>. I don't know about
anyone else but if I have to talk or listen to anyone ever talk of these
topics again, I am going to rip my hair out!
<p>
Person after person went around talking self defeating talk. Many said,
&quot;I am powerless not only over alcohol, but people places and things&quot;.
What baloney!
<p>
So when it came time for me to speak I said something like this....
&quot;Hi my name is _________ and I used to drink a lot. When I drank I got into
a lot of trouble. I don't do that today. In fact, I have not had a single
drop of alcohol in over 5 years now. My life is manageable today, my
drinking you could say is manageable today, as long as I don't have that
first drink. So I guess from what I've heard said here today means that
no alcoholic could ever hope to better himself. Such things include
aquireing a new career, keeping one's present job, making friends,
keeping friends. Having a happy family. If one is married it would be
impossible for an alcoholic to keep his family, let alone meet someone
new and start one. You can forget about ever being happy!&quot;
<p>
Needless to
say there were a lot of angry people in that room that day.
<p>
I looked around and said, &quot;What? didn't you <i>just</i> say you were
powerless over people, places and things? People if you <i>believe</i> you
are powerless over people places and things, then you can kiss your
hopes of having a fullfilling and rich life [goodbye]! You see, <i>I</i> need to have
power over myself, situations that involve people, and things such as
buying a house or a car or keeping my job. Without these things I would
be pretty miserable. I have power over myself and my marriage when it
comes to keeping it. It takes work. Both from my wife <i>and me.</i> I guess
no alcoholic could ever take on the medical field, for example. That
would require a lot of studying, power over the homework!&quot;
<p>
Well let me just say that I was asked to leave!
<p>
&quot;What? I thought I was allowed to speak my mind?&quot;
<p>
The chair person answered with.... &quot;Please
leave your discussion to the topic of alcohol and AA. It is clear to <i>us</i>
that you are probably not sober, or at best a dry drunk! Come back when
you have had an attitude adjustment&quot;
<p>
LOL! That is insane isn't it?
<p>
Well, I'm never going back. No matter what! Even if I start drinking
again, which I know I won't.
<p> 
Keep up the great site and BYE! ;)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mvega,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. Thanks for the letter and an entertaining story.
And congratulations on your freedom.
<p>
It's both funny and tragic how they flip out when somebody tells the truth.
And that's another
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_group_think">hall-mark of a cult</a>.
<p>
And those people are entitled to tell others how to live and recover from alcoholism?
<p>
Their stubborn insistence that they must be powerless over everything really
reminds me of the mythical <i>Church of Loserism</i> that I was describing
in the web page on
<a href="orange-powerless.html"><i>Powerless Over Alcohol</i></a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
It's the church where you proudly brag about what a helpless loser you are.
The Beatles' song <i>I'm a Loser</i> is the standard church music.
Competence, strength, intelligence, self-reliance, and self-confidence
are terrible vices and sins,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#freedom2think">immoral mistakes to be avoided
at all costs</a>,
while incompetence, stupidity, ignorance, irrationalty,
superstition, blind faith, dependency, weakness, powerlessness, and insanity
are virtues to be proudly &quot;admitted&quot; at church get-togethers.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are powerless over everything,&quot;<br>
&quot;You can't do it without your support group,&quot;<br>
</font>
and<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You can't handle life without having keepers to tell you what
to do&quot;,<br>
</font>
are the sacred teachings of the church.
</blockquote>
<p>
I thought I was being funny but it sounds like those people are living it.
<p>
Oh well, you are beyond that now.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Thanks for making the great site......<br>

<p>

Thanks for making the great website.

<p>

Thanks for making it as a great down load......

<p>

I have been fighting with an &quot;old AA friend&quot; lately and in some ways he
is a good friend, but I have been dipping into this site some more and
telling him about it, and he says essentially that your a poor deluded
fuck who's full of shit.

<p>

And I have put it to him &quot;Ok fine, go through his entire site, and
counter every fact he raises, with being either substantially
correct, partly correct or substantially false and misleading..&quot;

<p>

And despite being nailed point blank with &quot;provide the proof to support
your argument&quot; about 20 times over 30 emails, he has resorted to a whole
spectrum of shit from character assassination, to weak excuses, to lies,
ducking and weaving and everything, except to provide the evidence that
backs up his contention that you, via the information you have provided,
are according to him, full of shit.

<p>

And do you know what, he can't fucking do it....

<p>

He hasn't provided one fucking grain of evidence to support anything he
says in an effort to invalidate you as a person, for promoting
verifiable fact based information, that AA is a bullshit predatory cult.

<p>

I have been drug free now since Nov 89 and I have walked out of NA and
AA, a long time ago &#8212; because the members don't like people who get well
and can think for themselves, and the fellowships are so fucking corrupt
&#8212; as in the service structure is an &quot;organised crime&quot; gang type of
corrupt, and the people in the service structure right up to the WSO's,
back up all the crooks in the groups, areas and national service bodies.

<p>

They don't like people who are honest and they don't like being stood up
too or exposed for what they are.

<p>

So anything that exposes these criminals for what they are, gets my support.

From:  	&quot;Mairtin O M.&quot;

<p>

Hi Orange
<p>
Hope you're well.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mairtin,
<p>
Yes, I'm doing great, and I trust that you are too.
</font>
<p>

I was reminded after reading one of your recent
letters about how stale and still life is in AA. I remember one guy, who
had that blank, empty expression we discussed, sharing self-righteously
about how grateful he was and about how other members ought to be too.
<p>
Six years later I met him at a meeting. Guess what? He shared exactly
the same thing. Many members are like stuck records. If fact what they
often say is just a recording in their brain, with no original ideas. I
guess this is classic brainwashing.
<p>
I am no expert but many of the pro AAs that contact you appear mentally
disturbed. I don't say this lightly or as a joke. I mean really! It is
not funny but I admit I have almost fallen off my chair laughing at
them. Half the time I can't figure out what the hell they're talking
about or what point they're trying to make! My message to them is keep
sending in your letters. They're great! The lack of basic intelligence
and logic is a wonderful example and warning to all: This is what the 12
steps will do to your brain!
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, there is a very high incidence of mental illness in Alcoholics Anonymous.
Sometimes I think of it as a club-house for the nutcases.
<p>
Some psychologists did a survey of A.A. members and found that the vast
majority of them were mentally disturbed, ranging from merely neurotic, all the way
up to full-blown psychotic.
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_followers">Look here</a>.
</font>
<p>

<p>
Hey another thing. My IQ has increased since I left AA!! No joke mate! I
also dress better, have more confidence, and have gone back to education
&#8212; paid for by my boss! They used to say at meetings, &quot;things just happen
when you go to meetings&quot; Bullshit, life happens when you leave.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I believe it. My IQ has gone up too. Now actually we can't establish a real
cause-and-effect relationship there, not based on such thin data.
My improvement is probably because I have more years off of alcohol and
tobacco, and the brain and body have had more years to heal.
With such improved health comes improved mental functioning, for sure.
<p>
It is just coincidental that I also have just about the same number of years away from
the 12-Step clubhouse.
<p>
But there is certainly room to argue that getting away from the insanity
and relaxing and clearing your mind can improve your thinking.
Chronic anxiety and guilt is not good for your brain.
<p>
That would be a fun study to do, but it will probably never be done because the
Steppers won't cooperate with a study like that, one that would show that you
are better off without Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

I just found a bit of ACoA material from the course I did many years
ago. It is about the roles children play in an alcoholic family and how
they will turn out as adults!

<p>
<center>
<table width="91%" border="5" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td>
&quot;The family hero&quot;</td><td> turns out as an adult: </td><td> competent, organised, successful
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
&quot;The scapegoat&quot; </td><td>turns out as an adult: </td><td> good under pressure, has courage, helpful
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
&quot;The lost child&quot; </td><td> turns out as an adult: </td><td> Independent, creative, talented
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
&quot;The Joker&quot; </td><td> turns out as an adult: </td><td> good with company, charming, helpful
</td>
</tr>
</table></center>

<p>

Now there is one little snag. They have to do the 12 steps to achieve
this magical life as an adult.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah yes, that's the gotcha. And if you don't turn out to be witty and charming and good under
pressure, it's your own damn fault because you didn't work the Steps right.... right?
<p>
What they never bother to explain is just how or why
people turn out like that. How do those darned Steps do that magic, anyway?
I've never heard a good explanation of that one.
</font>
<p>
This nonsense came from the Handley
Centre in County Dublin, staffed mostly by AA members. It may have
originated in the US. If I find anymore of this crap I will send it on.

<p>

Yours<br>
Mairtin

<p>

Okay, Mairtin. Thanks for the input.

From:  	&quot;Howard W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Dry Drunk<br>

<p>

Dear Orange:

<p>

I find your web site  excellent; and, necessary.  And, almost entirely
correct; that is, I agree with almost all of it.

<p>

But, not quite all of it.

<p>

I strongly dislike the term &quot;dry drunk&quot;.  I consider that term to be merely
verbal abuse.  Verbal abuse perpetrated by AA zealots seeking to employ
emotional blackmail.

<p>

Taking that as my context, I must disagree with calling GWB (&quot;43&quot;) a &quot;dry
drunk&quot;.  By all accounts, George Walker Bush ended his abuse on his own;
good for him.

<p>

That bit reads as if it were written by an enemy of GWB, using whatever club
was available at the moment.  I do not believe that you should be a party to
that.  Plus, you should leave AA weapons in the hands of AA.  You are better
than that.

<p>

FYI, I am a dry drunk.  I quit on my own.

<p>

So, FYI, was my maternal grandfather, born 1880.  In 1919, he was drinking a
pint of legal bourbon ( Jack black) a day.  When prohibition came in, he
quit.  He was a dry drunk; and, a very fine fellow ( he died in  1965)
I draw your attention to the fact that Bill Wilson did not stop when liquor
became illegal.  Who should be my example???

<p>

In regard to AA, I asked myself this question:

<p>

Is AA part of the solution?   Is AA part of the problem?

<p>

All the rest is commentary.

<p>

I commend you and your efforts. You have my support and respect.

<p>

Regards <br>
Howard W

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Howard,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
I agree that the only relevant question about A.A. is whether it makes alcoholics
stop drinking. All of the talk about how wonderful the fellowship and brotherhood is,
and how nice the religion makes them feel, is just irrelevant cultish behavior.
<p>
I agree that the term &quot;dry drunk&quot; is nothing more than a put-down.
You must have seen my web page on
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">The Dry Drunk</a>,
I do my best to destroy the notion of &quot;dry drunk&quot;.

<p>
Also, when we see people behaving badly, it could be caused by anything from mental
illness and insanity down to just a hateful temperament, or greed, or callous indifference
to other people's feelings, but I don't attribute any of
it to &quot;dry drunk&quot;.
<p>
I have also repeatedly and consistently criticized books and magazine articles that tried to
push the &quot;dry drunk&quot; dogma:

<ul>
<li> A book by Arnold M. Ludwig:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Ludwig">
He has, unfortunately, a whole chapter on &quot;the dry drunk&quot;.</a>


<li> Robert Thomsen's biography of Bill Wilson:
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Thomsen">
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's
warts, his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his
years-long &quot;dry drunks&quot;...</a>


<li>
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#only_dry">
A really obnoxious puff piece that promotes A.A. dogma</a> and passes it off
as valid information about alcoholism and recovery:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century School
book">
When positive spirituality dominates our lives, we have no need to
alter our moods with addictive substances or behaviors.
...
The opposite is true for active alcoholics and sober but nonrecovering
alcoholics referred to in AA as &quot;dry drunks.&quot; Their lives
are dominated by a negative spirituality.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html">
<i>&quot;Spirituality: The key to recovery from alcoholism&quot;</i></a>,
Robert D. Warfield and Marc B. Goldstein,
<i>Counseling &amp; Values</i>, April 1996, Vol. 40, Issue 3, page 196.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I do my best to shred that nonsense.

</ul>


<p>
Now about the notion of George W. Bush being a dry drunk: I never called G.W. Bush
a dry drunk. Others have, but I did not. How could I when I don't think that there
is any such thing?

<p>
You did not say what page you were talking about. I have several references to
G. W. Bush and the concept of &quot;dry drunk&quot;.

<ol>

<li>
In the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Geo_Bush">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>, I asked
why the dogmatic A.A. members who accuse the do-it-yourselfers of being dry drunks
weren't saying that about Bush. Later, I found that a few did, but most just ignore
the question.
<p>
<li>
In the page on
Propaganda Techniques, I was exploring the A.A. &quot;Chosen People&quot; idea, and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#chosen_people">asking
how alcohol prepares us for leadership roles</a>. 
I mentioned Bush in that context, but didn't call him a dry drunk.

<p>
<li>
The most likely reference is Alan Bisport's editorial article,
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Bisbort">Dry Drunk: Is Bush making a cry for help?</a>&quot;
I quoted that article at length at the end of the file on dry drunks.
I think that the term 'dry drunk' was used a bit tongue-in-cheek there.
Bisport was exploring the concept a bit there, saying that &quot;A.A. says a dry drunk acts
like this... Does George act like that?&quot;
<p>
The real thrust of that article was to ask whether George Bush is suffering from
severe brain damage from 20 years of whiskey and cocaine.
Is George's current behavior the result of drug-and-alcohol-induced brain damage?

</ol>

Personally, I am most assuredly an enemy of George W. Bush. I regard him as a lying
murdering war criminal who should be executed for his crimes.
I think we should ship him off to Nuremberg and do with him what we did with the
Nazis.
<p>
But I don't call G. W. Bush a dry drunk. I can't. There ain't no such thing.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>

Dear Orange:
<p>
I am sorry that I did not understand your point with the chapter on &quot;dry
drunk&quot;.  I saw only the AA epiphet.

<p>

I find your site to be excellent.  I found the links you provided, which I
appreciated.

<p>

Myself, I quit on my own.  I started on my own as well.  I drank too much
after my wife passed away.

<p>

AA is completely unnecessary and useless, as is the 12 steps.  I went for a
few times after I quit and found AA to be pathetic; an insult.  I am not
alone in concluding that.

Date:  	Fri, February 17, 2006 <br>

<p>

hello,
<p>
In the email you put up as a update from Steven B, it looks like
the line &quot;he doesn't need a higher power apparently he is god!&quot; was
written by Steven himself . The email in general seemed supportive of
your site. You seem to hammer the guy for it by writing this:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I especially liked the line about, &quot;he doesn't need a higher power
apparently he is god!&quot;
So if you don't join a crazy cult religion and grovel and wallow in
guilt, then you suffer from delusions of grandeur and think you are God?

&#8212; reduce the argument to just two extreme choices

Well, Steven B wrote that as a criticism of Thorburn, I didn't see
anything in the links provided that had the &quot;he thinks he is god&quot;
statement. Is there something I'm not aware of? Has he written you a pro
AA email before? Is he in AA? His email reads like he's supportive of
your site. Your answer reads like you just bitch slapped him.

<p>

Just curious

Hi Rob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I think that perhaps you read some part of that exchange in some way different
than how either Steven or I read it.
I was certainly &quot;bitch slapping&quot; Thorburn, but not Steven B.
I wasn't criticizing Steven at all, and I'm pretty sure he knows that.
<p>
We have been continuing our exchange of letters, and did two more just today,
that you haven't seen yet. They are all in
<a href="orange-letters36.html#Thorburn">letters file 36</a>,
at the tail end of the file.
<p>
I think that the point of confusion was in the phrase &quot;I really
like the line about...&quot;
I meant that in the reverse sense of &quot;Now here is a really outrageous example
of a dishonest propaganda technique.&quot;
<p>

You are correct in saying that the &quot;he thinks he's god&quot; line came from an email
between Steven and Thorburn, so there is no link to it.
I trust that Steven is telling me the truth about it.
The reason that I believe Steven is because I have read all of the rest of the stuff that
I have been able to find by and about Doug Thorburn, including his own
web site, and I find it appalling. (And I will read his books, just as soon
as I can get my hands on them.)
We have another fake expert on our hands, telling us all about alcoholics and
addiction. And he goes on and on about how alcoholics &quot;need their egos deflated&quot;,
which in standard A.A. dogma is followed by &quot;alcoholics think they are god&quot;.

<p>
I really do &quot;have a thing&quot; about frauds and quacks who try to profit from the
suffering of sick people.
It's one of the lowest and most despicable crimes around.
It's really heartless, too.
I'll bitch-slap those quacks any day.
<p>
Oh, and this is just too good (again, using that reverse 'like' or 'good' sense).
This is the frosting on the cake.

We heard from reader Doug Thorburn, EA, CFP and drug addiction expert
in reaction to our story on porn star Jenna Jamison's autobiography:
&quot;I've long hypothesized that most porn stars are either addicts or
children of addicts. Jameson is both. I'd also theorize that men who
chop off their penises, mistaking them for chickens, are under the
influence and, at age 67, long-time alcoholics. And same for leaders of
mobs in Nigeria. Have you checked out my Thorburn Addiction Report?
