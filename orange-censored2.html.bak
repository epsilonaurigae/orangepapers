On Wednesday morning, December 28, 2005, I found that both my email account,
orange@orange-papers.info, and my IP number had been blocked by AOL.

<p>
It started out innocently enough:

<p>
I wrote a letter to AOL, explaining the situation, and that immediately bounced
back too. I'm not even allowed to send an email to the postmaster:

<p>

<table width="90%" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="3">

To:  	postmaster@aol.com<br>

<p>
Dear Webmaster or Postmaster:

<p>
I just received a letter from one of your members, and answered
it, and when I did, I was informed that the letter had been
rejected. I traced down the meaning of the error code, RLY:B2,
and your web site informs me that my email account has been
blocked from sending email to AOL members, allegedly &quot;because
we have received numerous complaints concerning mail coming
from that IP address.&quot;

<p>
I have never spammed anyone on AOL, or even written much to anyone
there, except for answering letters that come to my web site.

<p>
I run an anti-cult and anti-Alcoholics Anonymous web site, which
the more cultish A.A. members hate. Undoubtedly, some of them
have written complaints to you, falsely claiming that I have
committed some kind of offense.

<p>
Not so.

<p>
They are merely trying to sabotage freedom of speech, and squelch
dissenting voices.

<p>
Please look into this matter so that I can answer questions and
pleas for help from your members.

<p>
I shall also post this letter to the letters section of my web site,
here:
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters32.html">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters32.html</a>

<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
And I got the same error message back:  RLY:B2
<p>
You can't talk to the webmaster when you are blocked.

<p>
So I went to my alternate email address, orange.papers@gmail.com &#8212; Google mail &#8212;
which I mostly use for posting to newsgroups and other random junk,
and sent a message to the AOL postmaster from there.
<p>
It also immediately bounced with another error code: HVU:B1

    EXPLANATION:<br>
    There is at least one URL in your email that is generating substantial complaints from AOL members.
<p>
    SOLUTION:<br>
    If you own all the domains linked to in your e-mail, please contact us to discuss more effective management of your complaint levels. You can start by setting up a free complaint loop through this form. This will allow you to receive AOL member complaints against your domain.
<p>
    If you do not own the domain, please have the owner of that domain contact us.

<p>
Isn't that just a little bit arrogant and condescending, coming from a brain-damaged
corporation that destroyed the value of TIME/Warner stock?
Maybe they should learn to manage their own complaint levels.

<p>
I contacted a friend who isn't blocked, and sent everything to him,
and asked him to forward the letters to the postmaster at AOL.

Subject: New hassles with being censored

<p>
Hi Douglas,

<p>
I could use your help on this.

<p>
In trying to answer email to my web site, I
discovered that my email addresses had been blocked
by AOL. Both of them:<br>
orange@orange-papers.info<br>
orange.papers@gmail.com<br>

<p>
This has been happening for a while, but I didn't realize
that it was more than a matter of bad email addresses when
email got returned, until today.

<p>
I looked up the error codes in the returned email, and got
this:<br>
<b>
Error 554 HVU:B1<br>
There is at least one URL in your email that is generating substantial
complaints from AOL members.
<p>
Error RLY:B2<br>
This error message indicates that a block has been placed against your IP
address because we have received numerous complaints concerning mail
coming from that IP address.
</b>

<p>
Some more Steppers have undoubtedly been slandering
and libeling me again, this time to AOL.<br>
They gang up and send a whole lot of complaints about
how &quot;offended&quot; they are that somebody would dare to
tell the truth about their cult.

<p>
I have tried to email the AOL postmaster to tell him
about this problem, but even that email is blocked.

<p>
So I need you to forward this letter and all attachments
to: postmaster@aol.com

<p>
The attachments are blocked letters between me and
correspondents to my web site, and also the blocked
letters of complaint to AOL.

<p>
Oh, and please ask AOL to keep the identities of their
clients in these email attachments confidential, as
I am sure they usually do.
<p>
AOL should consider this a matter of counseling about
drug and alcohol problems, and as such this
matter should be treated with the strictest confidentiality.

<p>
And since it is also a matter of health and counseling,
and extending free help to those who still suffer,
I am sure that AOL does not wish to be guilty of
causing relapses or deaths of AOL members by preventing
them from getting advice and help.
<p>
So I am sure that AOL will look into this matter very,
very promptly, like today, before somebody relapses
for New Years.

<p>
Thanks.

<p>

<p>
And that's where it's at, as of 17:04 PM PST 28 Dec 2005.

<p>
It gradually occurred to me that I had been getting some returned email for
a while now, months, but I had mistakenly assumed that it was just email with bad
addresses, and didn't give it a second thought.
Now I think that AOL members have been prevented from getting answers for a while now.
<p>
So if you are using AOL, and you emailed me in the last month or two
and didn't get an answer,
you can probably thank AOL for not letting you get your email.
I try to answer ALL email.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
<p>
&#8212; &quot;Secret Agent&quot; Orange

<p><br><br>

P.S.: All kinds of things occur to my devious little mind, like that you 
readers who are on AOL can threaten to launch a class-action lawsuit,
complaining that AOL is preventing you from receiving life-saving
counseling from an old recovered alcoholic and drug user
who can teach people how to break out of their addictions and
stay clean and sober for 5 years.

<p>
That makes AOL financially liable for any damages or deaths that happen to
AOL members from drug or alcohol problems while they are cut off from
the help and aid of their counselor.
Theoretically, you can make AOL pay for your suffering.

<p>
Guess what is only 3 days away? New Years! Do you know how many people relapse
during New Years?
<p>
Somebody could retire rich off of this one.

Just to do a reality check, I contacted my ISP and asked him if there
was a problem with a spammer. He answered that nobody was spamming from
his machines. Then he contacted his own ISP, one tier up the pyramid
of servers. He got the answer that someone had compromised one of his
user accounts and had sent out a batch of spam, and that AOL had
immediately black-listed his IP number, and he was working with AOL
to get off of the black-list.
<p>
My ISP subcontracts out a lot of the technical work of being an ISP.
One of the things that he subs out is the email server. All email
from my domain goes through the ISP of my ISP. So when AOL blocked
the IP number of the ISP of my ISP, they also blocked my email.
<p>
But that does not explain how AOL blocked all email from my Google email
account. There is no connection between Google and my Orange-Papers.Org
domain, other than that I use the same signature on email from both
accounts.

UPDATE: Jan 5, 2006:
<p>
I posted this story to a few newsgroups, and got this response:
<p>

<pre>
John K. wrote:
&gt;&gt; &quot;Ahhh, the paranoia. ...
&gt;&gt; &quot;You should probably spend a little time
&gt;&gt; learning how the Net works. ... When you
&gt;&gt; send an E-mail, or post to a newsgroup,
&gt;&gt; the message arives with the IP address

&gt;&gt; I seriously doubt that ANYBODY thinks
&gt;&gt; that you and your website are important
&gt;&gt; enough to go to the trouble of blocking.
</pre>
...To which I answered:

<p>
Maybe you should put your condescending
attitude and your &quot;serious doubts&quot; back
in your toolbox. I've been a professional
programmer for 27 years, so I do have some
idea of how the Internet works.

<p>
What you don't know is that my web site
is hosted on machines many hundreds of
miles away from here. If you are looking
at the headers of newsgroup postings when
I post to newsgroups through Google,
what you are seeing is the IP number of the
free WiFi node across the street, which
does eventually connect to Qwest.

<p>
But that has nothing to do with the mail
server at my web site's host, which I use
for email to and from the web site. I access
that email program through HTTP, and the
resulting email gets the IP number of the
ISP's mail server &#8212; specifically, he
says that it gets the IP number of his
<i>eth0</i> port through which the email leaves
his machine.

<p>
In other words, I have two different
email accounts, with different IP numbers,
which is what I just said in the previous
message.  Please learn to read.

<p>
The email that I send out cannot possibly
have my own machines' IP numbers attached
to it, because I have home-made IP numbers
in a local area network.
They are in the 192.168.x.x block,
which are never transmitted to the Internet.
(And I have several machines, and I email
from more than one of them.)
And I never use an actual mailer program on
my machines because it will not work with
my home-made IP numbers. I always have to
access an HTTP-based email program like
Squirrel or Google mail that is on somebody
else's machine.

<p>
Then those messages and datagrams go through
my gateway machine that acts as a firewall
and does NAT (Name/Address Translation),
which changes my own home-made IP numbers
into the temporary number assigned by the
WiFi node with DHCP.

<p>
The WiFi node across the street also uses
LAN numbers, but in the 10.x.x.x range,
which are also never transmitted
over the Internet. That machine then
connects to another network that also
has numbers in the 192.168.x.x range,
but with different network numbers than mine.
Finally, that network connects to Qwest.
The first real IP number that you will find
in the whole chain of machines belongs to
Qwest, and that number is shared by a
whole lot of people.

<p>
My Orange-Papers.Org email addresses are
blocked by AOL, as are all other email
addresses originating at my ISP, and his
ISP. My ISP says that they are blocked,
and AOL says that they are blocked.

<p>
And so is my Google email account,
which has nothing to do with my ISP or
his IP numbers.

<p>
Now why would AOL go and block my Google
email address when they are ostensibly
concerned about some spam that came from
my ISP's machine?
(Actually, from an account on a machine
belonging to the ISP of my ISP.)
What does the one have to do with the other?

<p>
And how does AOL figure out where you have an
alternate email account? We are talking about
people who are not even customers of AOL.
How does AOL figure out that you might have an
alternate email account on Google or Yahoo
or Hotmail?

<p>
Or does AOL just read all of the email
going to their customers, looking at
signatures, snooping for banned URLs?

<p>
There is no doubt that they are figuring
it out, because their error message in
blocking my Google mail says that they
are doing it:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Courier,fixed">
&quot;Error 554 HVU:B1&quot;<br>
&quot;There is at least one URL in your email that
is generating substantial complaints from AOL
members.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Oh really? How do they know what URLs are in
anybody's email?

<p>
And what is &quot;substantial complaints&quot;?
In AOL-speak, it means that 3 people
complained about your web site.

<p>
Mind you, that error message was returned the
very first time I tried to email from Google
to an AOL customer. The very first time. That
Google email address is relatively new, and
I only use it for posting to newsgroups
(now known as Google Groups), and receiving
junk mail and for talking to a couple of
friends, so I know to whom I have sent
email from that account.
Besides, Google gives you 2 gigabytes of
storage and encourages you to never delete
anything, so I have all of my sent mail.
So I know that I had not sent any email
to anybody on AOL before from that account.

<p>
So you tell me: How did AOL decide that
they want to block my email from Google,
just because they are mad at the ISP of
my ISP, who is over in another state?

<p>
And if you want to conduct an interesting
experiment, why don't you cut and paste
my signature below onto the tail end of
a letter that you send to one of your friends
who is on AOL, and see if your letter gets
there or gets blocked and returned to you
with that error code?

<p>
Especially try that experiment from a
throw-away email account like on Yahoo
or Hotmail.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Oh, and especially try to email one of my web pages to somebody on AOL
as an attachment. That is a sure-fire rejection, because each of
my pages contains the forbidden <i>orange-papers.info</i> URL.
<p>
Try sending <a href="orange-jokes.html">the jokes page</a>
to friends on AOL. That's a short page, and entertaining
if it gets through. You can download it to your computer, and then send
it as an attachment to an email.
</font>

<p>
Have a good day. Try that experiment and
get enlightened.

5 January 2006:
<p>
I followed my own advice, and tried that experiment.
I found that I could sneak in a message from Google mail to AOL
if I erased the signature, and sent a letter that didn't say that
it had any connection to <i>Orange-Papers.Org</i>.
<p>
And I could sometimes get in a letter with a signature. Sometimes, it seemed.
Sometimes the message was returned with the error code that said
that the letter contained a forbidden URL, and sometimes I don't know
if the message got delivered, or just vanished into a black hole.
<p>
But trying to send a short web page as an attachment, like an
answer to somebody's letter to me, was a guaranteed rejection,
because all of those pages contain the forbidden
<i>Orange-Papers.Org</i> URL.
<p>
I went to another public mail service, which shall remain unnamed,
and tried the same experiment from there. The results were the same there.

<p>
Does somebody who is on AOL want to volunteer to partipate in further
experiments where I will see what I can send through and what
gets rejected, and you can tell me what you get?

<p><br><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"><p><br><br></center>

Okay, somebody volunteered, and we discovered that on January 15, 2006,
AOL suddenly silently lifted the blocks, without a word of explanation
or apology.
<p>
But the fact remains that AOL is reading their customers' email, and
rejecting what they don't like.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

UPDATE: 2014.02.13:
<p>
At 3:34 AM, I heard National Public Radio News say that the TIME &#8212; AOL merger
was considered the worst corporate merger in history.
<p>
No joke. AOL just destroyed the
value of TIME stock. TIME Inc. was actually worth less after the merger than before, 
which means that AOL had negative value. TIME paid billions of dollars for something
that turned out to be worth less than zero.
<p>
I could have told them that just from my own experiences with AOL.
<p>
Oh well, AOL is fading fast and will soon be a forgotten footnote in history. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
<p>
Have a good day now.
