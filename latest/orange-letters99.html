From:  	&quot;B., James Mr&quot;<br>

<p>
Hello Orange:
<p>
(please keep my email hidden &#8212; cheers dude).

<p>
Big fan of your site.  Your writing radically changed my life for the
better.

<p>
I left AA after finding the experience frightening, isolating, powerful,
irrational, and cruel.

<p>
I was suffering from major depression and major, major OCD whilst still
trying to 'practice these principals in all my affairs' &#8212; needless to
say, it scrambled me up even more.

<p>
I haven't been to a meeting in about 2 years &#8212; I am still clean, still
sober.  I work fulltime, keep fit, go to college, eat well etc &#8212; and I
am mostly very, very happy.

<p>
Looking back on the 3 years I spent in AA I realise now how 'false' it
made my thinking.

<p>
I hope this makes sense: it kind of created a false consciousness in
where it encouraged me to be scared of things I didn't need to be scared
of (mythical diseases, relapses that come from out of the blue, mystical
and horrible 'character defects).  So my head was full of nonesense.

<p>
And even more nonsensical was the compulsion to attend meetings, read
literature, do service.

<p>
Little of it true or needed.  AA membership was Thinking Bizarrely and
Acting Bizzarely.

<p>
I don't need to do that anymore &#8212; acting and thinking on instruction,
but, as I've said, acting bizzarely and thinking bizzarely on
instruction.

<p>
I wouldn't want any human to have to suffer that sht.

<p>
Free of drink and AA &#8212; makes me as free as I've ever felt in my life.

<p>
Hope that made sense &#8212; it's very difficult to describe my AA/drink
experience simply or straightforwardly.

<p>
Thanks again Orange &#8212; I will never forget this website as long as I
live.  I will be thinking of it fondly on the day I die &#8212; that's how
much it means.  It gave me the strength to get away and rebuild my life.

Hi James,

Thank you for the letter, and all of the compliments. I am glad to hear

From:  	&quot;Jamie Kelly&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Out of AA for good<br>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,
<p>
I had grave misgivings about AA from the start.
<p>
When I entered a 30-day treatment program in October, I was a pretty sick drunk. Not
falling over myself and blacking out nightly, granted, but still a fine mess.
I knew little about AA, other than what I'd absorbed through our culture. All I knew
was that &quot;powerlessness&quot; and &quot;higher power&quot; figured big into the program.
After treatment, I began attending AA meetings regularly &#8212; the &quot;90 in 90&quot; stuff they
recommended in rehab.
<p>
Because I am an atheist, I had &#8212; er, HAVE &#8212; grave misgivings about such a
&quot;spiritual&quot; program. I was initially comforted by people who said that my &quot;higher
power&quot; is one of my choosing, and so I chose &quot;the universe,&quot; as I am intrigued by
quantum theory and the ideas of Stephen Hawking and modern cosmologists and
astrophysicists. However, it soon became clear that this was looked down upon. I
wasn't &quot;with the program.&quot; One AAer told me I had to read the chapter &quot;We Agnostics&quot;
every day for 60 days, and then I would &quot;get it.&quot;
That struck me as hilarious, insulting and painfully disingenuous. In other words,
he implied that I was too stupid and unenlightened and had never developed my own
thinking on the matter, and that only by a daily routine of mindless repetition
would I then develop a belief in God. I secretly thought to myself, well, if that
were the case, then brushing my teeth would have become my religion a long time ago.
<p>
Still, I kept going.
<p>
<a name="nomeds"> </a>
Last week, one AA guy I barely know pulled me aside and started asking me about the
medications I was on. Now if someone on the street came up to me and asked me that,
he might be busy for a couple hours trying to find his teeth in the cracks of the
sidewalk. But I humored him, and told him honestly that I was on Prozac. He then
proceeded to talk about the &quot;evils&quot; of antidepressant medicine, and that I needed to
find a way to get off them.
<p>
Yes, this little fucker was advising me to get off the medication that had helped
save my life and sanity. That's some quality &quot;fellowship.&quot;
<p>
Also last week, I collected my three-month coin. When I announced my 90 days of
sobriety, I noticed an old-timer in the back give some money to a guy next to him.
Later, this asshole informed me that he had made a bet with some people that I
wouldn't make it 90 days.
<p>
This fucker was actually betting against me with other people in this wonderful
fellowship of AA.
<p>
Those two events have now sealed my decision to leave AA altogether, to never walk
through the doors of &quot;the rooms&quot; again. All my misgivings about AA turned out to be
correct.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is an enemy of science.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is an enemy of medicine and psychiatry.
<p>
And that's just its philosophy. I won't bother talking about the curious psychology
of the people who believe in and adhere to, as a lifestyle, the entire AA program.
Suffice it to say that many of them are really, really twisted people.
<p>
I am happy to be sober today. I'm looking forward to a long life of sobriety.
Already my life has improved in innumerable ways, and AA has nothing to do with it.
The idea of slogging off, day after day, to a meeting to listen to the same, tired
shit is now disgusting to me. I've let the floodgates of all my doubts about AA
open, and it feels like a great relief.
<p>
Thanks for your Web site. Keep up the excellent work. It's important, and I hope it
turns a lot of people away from a program that is as dangerous as it is abhorrent.
<p>

Hi Jamie,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for the compliments, and I'm glad to hear that you are doing better.
Congratulations on your sobriety and your new-found freedom.

Subject:  	Wife Doing 13th Step; Was Absorbed by AA<br>

<p>
Hi Orange:

<p>
I have looked over your writings about AA and I agree...from what I have
seen, AA (and Al-anon)
are cults that prey on gullible and/or troubled individuals.

<p>
Unfortunately, my soon to be ex-wife is one of them.

<p>
She is the type of person that is easily led, and tends not to think
critically.

<p>
Two years ago she joined AA, and became totally immersed in it...she
basically went
to work every day (when she was employed) and then spent every evening,
weekend,
and holiday at her AA club. While this was going on, she became very cold
&amp; hostile toward me.... when in the previous 13 years I was with her, she
was warm
and loving. Just before she joined AA, she told me that &quot;she loved me
more than ever&quot;. She talked
about buying burial plots next to each other, and that she hoped she
would go first because
she did not want to be alone without me, etc. etc.

<p>
Fast forward to the post-AA time: now I am a label... I am a &quot;normie&quot;.
She began to separate
herself out of the marriage. Just recently, she said that AA was her
family, and that she was &quot;involved&quot;
with another member. She has demonized me.

<p>
Her AA club is the &quot;feel good&quot; place where no one seems to worry about
responsibility.... they
all defer to a &quot;higher power&quot;. I guess thinking critically is not
allowed either. My wife can talk
about herself ad-nauseum... she can be as self-absorbed and absorbed into
AA activities
and members as much as she wants.... who needs the outside world,
friends, a husband etc when you
have AA??

<p>
I attended a few Al-anon meetings at my wife's request... but it seemed
all people did
was bitch about their lives (some <i>ad nauseum</i>) but since there was no
&quot;crosstalk&quot;.... it did not seem
like anything was being accomplished at all. We just repeated &amp; read
passages from the &quot;Big Book&quot;.... which
sort of creeped me out.... what the heck is this....??? Pseudo-religion?
In the name of &quot;Bill&quot; the holy father?????

<p>
Anyway.... my wife is leaving me.... her personality is completely
different than it had been. I guess it is nice
to be surrounded by other AA cult members that take you in, sleep with
you, etc. She has no interests, friends,
or activities outside of AA... it is AA all day, all night.... all her
reading material is AA.... she wears an AA necklace
with an AA pendant... has AA tee shirts... she has AA stuff hanging on the
walls (&quot;12 steps&quot;, various
AA things of one sort or the other hanging on the walls).... and I guess
she has a lot more in common with her fellow
ex-drinkers and dual-diagnosis folks (she is also bipolar) than with her
long time husband and former best friend.

<p>
The AA Cult has absorbed my wife into its fold.

<p>
Is there any hope of her waking up and realizing that AA has &quot;gone too
far&quot; in controlling her thinking
and life?

<p>
Steve D.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm really sorry to hear about your loss. 
I don't have any answer that I believe will work to make her wake up and snap clear.
<a name="Hassan"> </a>
I can suggest Steve Hassan's book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank"><i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>,
which has some useful suggestions for getting loved ones out of cults.
The book was also discussed here:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Don't give up</a>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Hassan2" target="_blank">Use indirect criticism of the cult</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters20.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Try again</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters21.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Already over the edge</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters24.html#Hassan3" target="_blank">Phobia induction</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters32.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Try jokes and Hassan</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters46.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">Recommended again</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters69.html#Hassan1" target="_blank">What does she get out of it?</a>

</ul>
<p>
But nothing is a guaranteed technique.
The problem is, when someone is as far gone and obsessed as your wife, it may take many years
for her to grow tired of the A.A. routine and seek something else to fill the void in her life.
And whatever obsession catches her fancy next may not include you.
<p>
I get the impression from your letter that she becomes sequentially obsessed with one thing
after another, seeking to feel fulfilled. First drugs, then cult religion. Then, who knows?
It would probably be very helpful to get her to a psychiatrist, but the odds of her going and
working on issues and taking her medications are not good.

<p>
Sorry to be so depressing. I'm going to forward this letter to Steve Hassan and see if he
has anything to add.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hey I'm just letting you know what a good job you did on your website. After reading it, I realized that what I needed was a psychiatrist, not aa. Thank you so much for freeing my mind.

<p>
Now that I have consulted a psychiatrist, I am on track to become a high school teacher. I have gone back to school for my teaching credential. This might not have happened if I was still in the aa rooms. Your work has done more good than you know.

<font color="blue">
A note: Someone tipped me off that there is a movie on YouTube that satirized Moral Re-Armament back in
1940. It is called &quot;Susan and God&quot;, starring Joan Crawford and Fredric March.
The uploader divided the movie into 13 segments. One particular segment
begins with one of Dr. Frank Buchman's Oxford Group / Moral Re-Armament
&quot;house parties&quot;. You don't need to watch the whole thing,
but the first few minutes are informative.

This is the link to part 10:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321220819/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdMd4dUbkKo&amp;feature=channel_page">
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdMd4dUbkKo&feature;=channel_page</a>

<p>
They hit the nail on the head in so many ways.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The condescending attitude towards someone who didn't wish to join the cult:
&quot;She's hopeless.&quot;
And another member sactimoniously proclaims: &quot;Nobody is hopeless.&quot;
<p><li>
The use of propaganda songs and music to carry the Oxford Group / Moral Re-Armament message.
And the simple-minded approach where &quot;a wise horsey&quot; supposedly gives out sage spiritual teachings.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_fix_newcomers">Everybody is defective and needs fixing</a>.
The singer with the guitar proclaimed that we aren't very
nice, and we were just made that way. And we can't change ourselves
for the better &#8212; not unless we join Frank's group.
<p><li>
Which leads right into the use of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#preachers_we">
the propaganda technique called &quot;The Preacher's <i>We</i>&quot;</a>:
<i>We</i> are defective;
<i>We</i> aren't nice;
<i>We</i> can't change ourselves for the better.
It's much easier to slip accusations through peoples' defenses when you denounce &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;,
rather than pointing a finger directly at someone and accusing them.

<p><li>
The presumptuousness of people proclaiming that they are
<i>Listening to God</i> and <i>Getting Guidance</i> in morning s&eacute;ances.

<p><li>
The mandatory hearty cheerfulness.
<p><li>
The idea that attending these parties makes people more spiritual.
<p><li>
The grandiose assumption that they were &quot;building a decent sort of
world&quot;, and &quot;remaking the world&quot;.

</ul>

<p>
Enjoy.

  Hello Orange,
 
<p>
  I have very much appreciated reading your work.  I discovered it when the
  brainwashing started to wear off after about 9 months.  I was a 3 decade
  drinker and ended up in &quot;highly recommended&quot; voluntary treatment which as
  it turns out was &quot;very intense&quot; AA indoctrination.  One of the most
  frustrating things now is having a brain again and being told not to get
  too clever.  Thanks for all the reading recommendations and website links.
<p>
   I knew there was more than one answer and something else was wrong.  I
  was just starting to figure it out when reading your online book verified
  what I had been discovering on my own.  My initial doubts really surfaced
  during an H and I session i was doing and I realized I could not in all
  honesty and integrity proselytize the AA program to anyone.  Anyway,
  thanks again for your work.

From:  	&quot;Bill O.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	RE: Are you still there?<br>

<p>
Hello again Orange,

<p>
I hope this is not too rambling or long, but I need to tell this story to someone
who understands.  Today I came home from work and collected all my AA literature,
books and study notes, which I will now recycle.  All the other books (your
recommendations and others) on addiction that I've read will be donated to the local
library.  Alcohol is no longer a part of my life.  I have no desire to drink and I
feel fully recovered (contrary to what I hear at the meetings)  I know now that
booze is not an option for any reason.

<p>
I, like some of your other letter writers thought that sticking around AA for the
newcomers was valuable, but after my last experience I'm through.  Those of us who
do feel that we are recovered and in control of our drinking are apparently a threat
to the group.  My last meeting experience was not ugly or mean-spirited, but it was
as if I had blasphemed so horribly that interaction with me would have been
dangerous.  Comments followed about the the futility of thinking of yourself as
recovered.    I am very discouraged with the narrow mindedness of even the nicest
people I have met when it comes to the idea of getting a life and moving on.   So,
as I have my life back now, I am now moving on.

<p>
As I mentioned in a previous email,  Your web site provided an important outlet for
my confusion and frustration.  What is really disconcerting is that there are
probably many people who would benefit from interaction with others and their ideas,
not associated with AA, but will not find them.  I know I would have.

<p>
During my involvement in AA over the last year and a half, I never experienced any
of the horror stories shared by others in your letters section.  I did experience
through reading a lot of non-AA literature, a great strengthening of my own personal
beliefs and convictions which became incompatible with much of the AA philosophy.
Expression of this personal and intellectual growth was rarely well-received, as you
are well aware.

<p>
I could also never buy into the Bill W. comparison.  I tried, but I've always been a
decent honest guy.  The only thing I ever lied about was alcohol.  I've a had a good
job and reputation for 30 years.  I just could not wrap my head around life without
booze, at least until my addiction got so bad I had to ask for help.  I did not feel
the need for a religious conversion or a new social group, I just wanted to be sure
I was not going to drink again like I used to.  As I have now learned, sobriety has
little to do with AA and much more to do with my personal decision to live my life
free of alcohol.  Perhaps the message is more profound to me because I did struggle
to find it myself.

<p>
It seems I have blown off enough steam, so I will close.  Once again I extend my
thanks for all the work you have put out there for those of us searching out our own
answers apart from the confusion and intellectual bigotry of AA.

<p>
Bill

good read.  Also, have read Steven Hassan's first book and his second book is in
shipment to me now.

<p>
By the way, I have been in AA for 26 years, was involved with a sponsorship type
cult for 4 years.  I had to find my way back to sanity on my own and have been
traveling on that journey for 22 years.  I don't mean to imply that I haven't had
help because I have had lots of help, the point is that I had to put the effort
forth and seek out the help.  I found that the one of the best ways for me to
&quot;break the ties that bind&quot; is to use AA's own literature for ammo.  I have found
books such Steven Hassan's and other information on cults very helpful also.  I
still attend AA meetings &#8212; selectively.  I have sought other avenues of recovery and
spirituality too.  I know there are many tools in the world to help people with all
sort of issues and I openly encourage other to seek out and utilize those tools in
the best way they see fit.  I know I will never be able to change A.A. or the worlds
view of addition, but, I know that my quiet ranting at meetings has help others to
reach and seek what ever help they need outside of A.A. without negative emotional
consequence from inside A.A.  My life is good.  In a way we both do the same thing,
face the wrongs we see and try change them with the best tools we have &#8212; you and I
just have different tools.

<p>
As, for your website, I thought I was fairly knowledgeable of A.A. history &#8212; wrong.
Your site has given me much new insight into A.A. history, especially the actual old
letters and documents!  As for your interpretations and presentation of the facts,
well I probably agree with you about 50% of the time.  But, I will most likely never
buy any thing or any one point of view whole hog again!  I have some guiding
principles that I have figured out over the years that help me.  They are as
follows:

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1.  Learn to think for yourself or else someone will think for you.
<li> 2.  Seek to know what you believe and why you believe it.
<li> 3.  Question everything.
<li> 4.  The only test I use is this: Is it adding to or subtracting from my life?
<li> 5.  If all of us were the same only one of us would be necessary.
</ul>

<p>
Wishing you truth and wisdom,

The following three letters came in at about the same time, and coincidentally they all talk
about Washington County, Oregon, which is the county immediately to the west of Portland, Oregon.
The Washington County legal system has a less than stellar reputation.
Washington County is the home of some very large corporations like Intel and Nike.

<p>
Orange,

<p>
The county openly promotes AA/NA/CA/ and any and all anonymous affiliates in
their tax payer funded &quot;treatment&quot; program, no surprise there.

<p>
What is also no surprise is the fact in room 105-J in the county court house
is a big copy of the twelve steps from AAWS. This is exactly the same as
displaying a copy of the ten commandments in a court house lobby, a clear
violation of the establishment clause of the 1st amendment. I see no legal
reason for a copy of the twelve steps to be displayed in a space paid for
with public funds period. I would love to see that poster removed from that
room by a federal court order. The Inouye ruling is a solid case against
such government promotion of the cult called AA/NA in it's many forms. Now
they will &quot;sponsor&quot; yet another anonymous cult called Dual Diagnosis
Anonymous. The treatment community is over the top with the promotion of the
cult as you well know. I am sick of this maskarade of AA being anything a
sham cult Christian promotion of faith. Washington County needs to be sued
in a federal court over this cult promotion of &quot;treatment&quot;. With the track
record of the &quot;treatment&quot; it is a sham and danger to those forced to attend
it. An example needs to be made of this cult promotion here in Oregon once
and for all. I for one will be contacting the ACLU about this display in
room 105-J.

Sober without AA thankyou!

Subject:  	MRT (moral reconation therapy) read moral rearmament dressed up by a couple of shrinks.<br>

<p>
Orange, here's another clue about a program called MRT, I'm sure you have
heard of it. In any case Washington County Oregon seems to think that
alcohol and drug use are symptoms of a lapse of morality and a cause of the
disease of addiction, (yeah right, sure what ever you say B.S). These people
who are the &quot;treatment staff&quot; are the most dishonest liars and out and out
cheats I have ever met. Of course they all back each other up with their
phony credentials and certifications, and each one is in &quot;recovery&quot; of
course. The thing is, most long ago quit doing what ever it was they were
doing, and simply can't leave the cocoon they live in sheltered in, hiding
from the real world we all have to deal with each day. Pretty it isn't
always, but it is real, which is better then living inside of a fantasy
world of &quot;recovery&quot; and getting paid for it. They don't earn an honest pay
check, they steal it by fostering a program that is harmful to those forced
into it. We all have our troubles in life, but AA isn't the answer these
treatment people say it is. It's pure crackpot lunacy from a man whose soul
(pun intended) intention was to open up a publishing business, now called
AAWS, it sure paid his bills didn't it? AA was always a business plan from
the looks of the 100 man stock prospectus details. A for profit one at that,
not a non profit corporation as it is today. I for one would love to a real
accounting of the books of AAWS and it's spin off chapters.

<p>
Moral Reconation Therapy is a huge ripoff copy of AA. The last page of their
treatment manual says it all, &quot;state of grace&quot;, and artistic references to
the bible, easter lillies, palm fronds, candle stick with a candle lit, and
a copy of what is obviously a bible rendered as a page dress up suggestion
of what MRT is really all about, get religion now while we can still &quot;save&quot;
you. This MRT manual is a monstrosity of psychobabble religion by the two
authors, both Ph.d's and their captive audience is all in the &quot;corrections
system&quot; which is anything but corrective. It's more like a system of how to
cook meth 101.1 and the system is a college of higher education for speed
freaks, none of which I am... This treatment &quot;program&quot; is pure B.S. it
doesn't work, failure rate of 75 to 80% by their own numbers, which of
course they never tell the real numbers to who ever writes the checks for
the program, it simply doesn't work.

<p>
Oh well as you say, have a good day!

From:  	&quot;Gavitti&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
First off &#8212; Thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of all of us out
here who find the whole AA/NA recovery machine revolting. Your site is a
real psychological reinforcement for those of us who were pretty sure our
nonconformist ideas weren't crazy but had a hard time finding anyone that
agreed with us.

<p>
I wanted to share story.

<p>
A few years back I knew it was time to stop getting loaded. I was starting
to raise a family, wanted to set a better example for my daughter and
honestly was just tired of it. I was done. My wife at the time sadly was
not.. she chose dope over marriage. Both of our lives started to fly
apart, legal problems ensued, one thing led to another and I found myself on
probation and in the position of having to volunteer to go to treatment or
losing contact with my daughter in an ugly divorce. I really had no idea
what &quot;treatment&quot; was but a local attorney who specialized in drug/alcohol
cases suggested I comply. During the process of trying to find a treatment
facility my time to report to the court expired, my ex turned me into my PO
and boom,........ I was now going to do treatment in custody. Now the
Washington County, Oregon treament facility is probably one of the nicest places
to be incarcerated. You get your own clothes, carpeted floors, seconds on
food every other day and an outside smoke break every two hours. We called
the place &quot; Camp Snoopy&quot;. However the treatment system is pure 12 step
bullsh*t being shoved down your throat 24/7. You eat it, breath it and sleep
with it or you do not progress though the program. At any point, if you are
not spouting the correct and proper 12 step Dogma, you can get held back 1 &#8212; 
30 days, or simply sent to jail (which happened to 4 of my fellows during
my stay). I had some immediate issues and questions about the program that I
soon learned not to address to anyone in authority. The constitutional issue
of the state forcing a religious program on citizens as a condition
of custody came to mind first. (You either believe and participate in our
program or you go to jail.) Unqualified, non-medical personnel making medical
diagnosis and recommendations also came to mind. (You're a junkie, nothing
stronger than aspirin for you, and what kind of allergy meds do you have
there, we don't care if they're prescription, you shouldn't take them.) Was
this a cult? It sure seemed like one to me. Does it work? Nope, even the
people teaching it say it has a 95% failure rate. I very quickly learned
that the whole program was simply a huge indoctrination process for the 12
step way of life,... and as much as I hated it, I also learned to talk the
talk, because I wanted the hell out of there as fast as I could make it.

<p>
Then one day my time was up, I had been a good boy and run the gauntlet in
proper form. I had one last step &#8212; more or less an exit interview with my
counselor and PO. At that point they informed me that it would really help
my case if (translation: we'll let you go when...) I lived in clean and
sober housing for a while (6 months was suggested) they said as soon as I
found &quot; acceptable&quot; housing I could go. I found a cool place down by the
Willamette river here in Portland that I thought would be a nice place to
chill out, get my life back in order and move on... I thought the only
conditions for this place would be, &quot;don't get loaded while you live here&quot;
but NOoooooo! It was 12 step hell all over again. 4 meetings a week,
mandatory volunteering, etc, etc.... The only qualification for the two guys
that ran the house were that they were former drunks and junkies,.. nothing
else,... and some very large foundations threw money at them for all of
this... After 7 months of living there I finally moved out... I was done.

<p>
The farther I got away from the treatment/recovery community and
experience the more I questioned their means and methods. I figured
someday I'd find time do a little research about addiction,recovery and
treament industry. When I finally got into looking around the information
scared me more than anything. I found it eerie that an entire industry could
exist and be supported by a program that has absolutley no scientific or
medical basis. Billions are being spent by every arm of our government on
programs that make the public feel warm and fuzzy but accomplish
nothing. Why more people don't see this is amazing to me but it's happening
right in front of us every day.

<p>
When I found your site it was like, &quot;holy sh*t!&quot; there are other people out
there that don't buy into the AA/NA, treatment industry BS. Up until that
time I thought I was either crazy or just missing something, probably some
leftovers from treatment (I can't be right, my thinking is stinking.!!)  I
think I've read about every page of your site over the last 6 months... more
than once I've been impressed with how thorough and well documented every
piece of information on the site is.

<p>
Today I live a pretty good life. I've started two new businesses and one is
actually making money. I have everything I need in life and a lot of the
stuff I want.  Finding your site has reinforced that all of that is simply
OK.

<p>
Keep up all of you good work &#8212; there's a world of people out there that need
to see it.

<p>
Take care

Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Sorry to take so long to answer your letter. It got misplaced, and I just found it.
Unfortunately, your year is almost up, either way.
<p>
The A.A. commmandment that you must not get into a relationship for a year is just another
A.A. superstition based on no facts at all.
And not having sex for a year is pure bullshit.
<p>
(Note that
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the unscrupulous A.A. sponsors</a>
do not apply that rule to themselves when they decide to seduce a cute young female newcomer.)
<p>
The only shred of truth in that slogan is the idea that a recovering person can make life more difficult for
himself if he gets into an intense relationship and it goes sour and they break up. Some people
get so depressed from failed relationships that they have a few drinks to console themselves, and that's bad.


<p>
But there is no guarantee that a love relationship will go bad. Some go great.
Personally, I think that a good
relationship can be a big help in staying sober.  And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">the Harvard Medical School found</a>
that the support of a good spouse was a great asset for a recovering alcoholic, and actually helped more than
Alcoholics Anonymous did.

<p>
Thank you for your writing on Bill W., the primary author of the book,
Alcoholics Anonymous.  I have no issue with whether the things you
assert about Bill Wilson were true.  I believe, however, that you err
when you suggest that discredits the work he did.  The fact that, a
magnificent God saw the covering of alcoholics and chose to use a vessel
of his own choosing says much more about the Author than the vessel.

<p>
I have an extensive background in biblical scholarship.  However, even a
novice cannot miss the clear evidence that many of those whom God had
chosen went on to great mistakes!

<p>

<p><li>
Samson &#8212; chose lust over God's will, yet found in Hebrews 11, the heros

<p><li>
Moses &#8212; disobeyed God and refused entrance into the promised land-and
yet, we do not discard or discredit his writings.<br>
<p><li>
Abraham &#8212; after chosen of God lied about his relationship with his wife &#8212; TWICE!
</ul>

<p>
If there is an overarching truth about the nature of God in relationship
to man, it is this:  God has factored our stupidity into His plan for
our lives.

<p>
Does this excuse sin?  Of course not.  But who among us ever needed an
excuse?

<font color="blue">
Hello Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer it, but it got misplaced and I just found it.
<p>
Sorry, but I cannot accept the premise that Bill Wilson was working for God. God would never foist such
a heretical fraud on sick people. Jesus Christ said that you shall know them by the fruits of their
labors. Well, the fruits of Bill Wilson's labors are that he created a cult that fails to help alcoholics.
It just lies to them about helping them, and gets them yammering a whole lot of blasphemous nonsense.
<p>
And A.A. is grossly heretical and unChristian. Read the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</i></a>.

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
A.A. increases the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">
increases the rate of rearrests for drunkenness</a>, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
And I believe that a good case can be made that A.A. also increases the divorce rate and the suicide
rate in alcoholics.
<p>
That is not a gift from God. (I will leave it to others to figure out whether it is a gift from Satan.)

Subject:  	&quot;Tom R&quot; can't really have much of an &quot;extensive&quot; background in biblical scholarship<br>

<p>
I read over your letters on a regular basis.  I think you've done great work with
your site.  I'm sure you don't want to turn your &quot;letters&quot; pages into a forum for
religious debate but, I was reading over &quot;Tom R&quot;'s letter and his claim to
&quot;extensive background&quot; in biblical scholarship is belied by the facts he presents.
I guess I felt compelled to write a rebuttal because, once again, it shows the
extent a 12-stepper will go to lie in order to preserve their religion.  I also used
to study the bible for many hours a day.  I'm no longer Christian, but here's what
the Bible really has to say about the facts he presents:

<p>
Samson &#8212; chose lust over God's will, yet found in Hebrews 11, the heroes
of faith.
Samson proved his genuine repentance by giving his life to destroy God's enemies.
Bill Wilson never came anywhere close to any such sacrifice either materially,
spiritually, emotionally or spiritually.  Bill Wilson never was in any way the man
Samson was.

<p>
Peter &#8212; denied Jesus 3 times, still used by God to stand up on Pentecost
as representative of the Apostles.
Peter denied being an associate of Jesus because of a valid fear he'd be seriously
harmed.  He did not deny that Jesus was the Christ.  Peter's repentance was
genuine.  He never made that mistake again.  His repentence is also evidenced by the
fact that DURING PENTECOST he was very vocal before the WHOLE WORLD about his belief
in Jesus.  Bill deliberately chose to engage in narcissistic behavior that harmed
people over and over again.  He never genuinely changed as evidenced by his nasty,
consistent 13th stepping habit.

<p>
Moses &#8212; disobeyed God and [was] refused entrance into the promised land-and
yet, we do not discard or discredit his writings.
Those writings were never Moses' in the first place.  He didn't write those things,
God did.  According to the bible, God directly wrote on the tablets himself.  He did
not use Moses to write on the tablets.

<p>
Abraham &#8212; after chosen of God lied about his relationship with his
wife &#8212; TWICE!

<p>
I suppose this depends on what one calls a lie.  There are, of course, &quot;lies of
omission&quot;.  However, Sarah, WAS Abraham's sister.  His half-sister, to be exact.  He
didn't tell the ruler of the land that Sarah was also his wife because, in that day
and time, to do so may have cost him his life so that the ruler could take his
NOTORIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL wife.  Oh, and before someone jumps on Abraham for incest, the
fact is there were no laws against marrying a close relative in Abraham's day.  Some
biblical scholars have suggested that this may be because it took 100's of years
since Adam's fall from grace (perfection) for human genetics to get frail enough to
cause problems from such intermarriage.

<p>
Anyway, that's my two-cents worth.  Nice to see one more 12-stepper pushing lies to
defend Bill Wilson and his kooky religion.  I don't know where he got his &quot;biblical
scholarship&quot; from, but he couldn't have possibly made those mistakes if he'd
actually ever read the Bible itself.

Hello Juanita,
<p>
Thanks for the input. That's good. And that certainly skewers his argument.
<p>
Have a good day.

These are two more of the beautiful people who just stopped by to see the goslings. These little goslings
are the greatest ice-breakers in the world.

The goslings are nesting and resting between us. They have no fear of the new friends who just showed up.
Rather, they actually seek out their company. I am not in the picture because I am holding the camera.
I'm sitting on the ground across from this fellow. The goslings placed themselves right between us so
that we could protect them from any predators who might come along. It's just natural gosling behavior.
They always seek the protection of the center of a circle of adults.

From:  	&quot;allan o.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	letter sent to FB page with a couple new questions<br>

<p>
I was having trouble sending this to your site so I sent to FB [Facebook],
remembered you don't
check it much so tried the site again... the problem was on my end.
I added some new
stuff at the end so don't delete if you read the FB one!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Alan. Okay, not deleted.
</font>
<p>
Happy New Year!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, you too.
</font>
<p>
I just had a thought: what do you think about creating a section on your site for
'professional support' or something along those lines? I notice a frequent criticism
from steppers is the 'lack of support from licensed professionals', etc.. I also
noticed you have received some letters from some of the more rational professionals
in the field.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That would be interesting. I'm also looking into just setting up a forum or bulletin board system
of some kind. A bunch of people have requested that.
</font>
<p>
I bet if there was a space created (even if it was just a section for you to place
letters from professionals who support you) that people like me would contribute.
Actually, I haven't come across too many people like me, i.e. licensed
professionals, former steppers, who are outspokenly critical and call it for what it
is: a religious cult. Most counselors who are not true believers, seem to lamely
indirectly support AA by default. One of them just told me the other day: &quot;It is
cultish but some people need it and it does provide help for some.&quot;

<p>
She is an otherwise good therapist and someone I respect. My guess is that many
people like her just haven't looked that far into 12-step ideology and are
indifferently accepting of it, I think because it has become part of the fabric of
our society. Familiarity. My guess would be that if I presented AA ideas to this
therapist in a time and place where there was no AA, she would tell me they are
crazy. I bet a lot of therapists who 'accept' AA would not accept it at all if they
were hearing it for the first time in this day and age.

<p>
She asked me if I agreed with her and I said no. She looked askance. I told her that
you can't have it both ways. You can't say it's &quot;cultish&quot; but also say that it's a
benign support club. She feels that the social aspects have merit and I know you
have found that to be one of AA's good points. I would only agree with that very
lightly and with a few qualifiers.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
1. Any social support value is highly dependent on the type of meeting and the
people in it. As you know as well as I, meetings can vary greatly from meeting to
meeting.
<li>
2. The social values are nil if the club is spouting rigid, harmful and
self-defeating ideology.
<li>
3. The irony is that, in my opinion, any true social value would most likely come
from meetings where they don't practice/adhere/preach the true nature of AA.
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue">
All I can say is, &quot;Yes.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Btw, I read that you are a guitar player. Me too. I have two Gibson acoustics these
days, one mahogany, one rosewood. I agree, that music has provided me a tremendous
amount of indirect therapeutic benefit. That, and a physically demanding
activity/hobby. I am frequently recommending patients pick up a challenging hobby,
preferably something physical if they are able to, health-wise. For the past year or
so, I've been doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, which is demanding, to say the least. The
only drawback is most of the guys I train with are 10 to 20 years younger! I never
really felt 40 until I hit the mats, so to speak. I'm thinking about going on an
Advil drip. Haha.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, rosewood. Love it. I have an acoustic Martin D16R, all rosewood. It has just fantastic tone.
A dream guitar. And those Gibsons are dream guitars too.
<p>
Alas, I'm not doing any physical training &#8212; not like judo. I have to be very careful with my bones, as
I have osteopenia (like osteoporosis) pretty bad. Bones in my feet have broken three times
in the last six years, just from walking up the street. No sports, no running, no touch football,
just skipping down the stairs or walking up the street. Crack!
<p>
So doing Jiu Jitsu would be very foolish for me.
<p>
I have heard that osteoporosis is yet another one of the conditions that alcoholism can cause.
That may explain how I came up with such an odd-ball condition.

</font>
<p>
One of many things I am wondering about as I wade through the reams of letters you
get. Do you receive mail from steppers that you DON'T post because it is too
hateful, profane, etc? It is remarkable, how few rational debates the true believers
make. The most rational, or at least not hate/condescension filled, debates seem to
come from the more laissez-faire members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I almost never censor the email. True-believer A.A. members routinely
call me things like a sack of motherfuckers and I publish it.
It's no big deal. (Actually, I kind of enjoy showing what their
&quot;serene and grateful spirituality&quot; amounts to.)
I'm hard-pressed to think of a letter that I had to censor.
There are a few incoming letters that I don't bother to publish because it's just the
same person sending the same rant over and over again, but just a very tiny few.
<p>
Mainly, things go unpublished just because I am so backlogged in answering
and publishing letters. I still have stuff that is up to two years old that I don't know if I will ever
get to.  When I moved two years ago, I fell behind and I never got caught up.
So there is a lot of unpublished stuff, but it isn't censored.
It's almost random luck whether something gets published or not.
</font>
<p>
Anyway, I only make the suggestion of a 'professional' section, thinking it might
give steppers one less thing to attack you for. I'm certainly not suggesting it
because I think you need any help defending yourself. You do that quite well. Hope
you enjoyed the holidays.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I'll think about it. That could be a thread or section on a forum. Of course, the next problem
is, how do you figure out if someone is actually a professional?

<p>
p.s. I was reading Dick B's analysis of early AA differences between the NY group
and the Akron group. He claims that the Akron group, which he says was something of
a bible study group had a significantly higher recovery rate (he says 75%
thereabouts) than the NY group. He also claims that official AA history tends to
ignore that in favor of the NY groups non-bible beginnings.

<p>
Do you know anything about that? Have you heard, come across anything that supports
his assertion?

<p>
He seems to be very, very well researched/informed on AA history. While I certainly
don't agree with his overall AA views, he seems a like a legit/honest source and
seems to be a bit critical of the NY groups 'departure' from the bible. What do you
think?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I like Dick B. for his careful historical research. Unfortunately,
I think he is taking the grandiose claims
of those enthusiastic Oxford Groupers in Akron too seriously.
<p>
That's what the Akron group was, more so than Bill Wilson's group in New York &#8212; 
true believer Oxford Group members. Dr. Bob and his fellow alcoholics remained in the Oxford Group for
years more than Bill Wilson did, and Dr. Bob was not the leader of the Akron chapter of the Oxford Group.
When the alcoholics finally split from the Oxford Group, all that they did was rename their group.
They still practiced Buchmanism and followed all of the Oxford Group practices and recuiting techniques,
and still parrotted the same slogans.
<p>
The Oxford Group routinely played the numbers game, and claimed far more members than they really had,
and implied that everyone who attended just a few meetings was a committed member who wholy endorsed
Frank Buchman and his doctrines. And then they did the same thing with alcoholics. When they succeeded in
drying out Russell Firestone, the prodigal son of the tire manufacturer Harvey Firestone, the Oxford Group claimed
that they were the new salvation of alcoholics, with a never-fails cure (if you follow the program right).
<p>
And that is in fact how the Oxford Group got established in Akron.
Harvey Firestone was so grateful for the Oxford Group sobering up his son
that Harvey sponsored a big convention/revival
for the Oxford Group in Akron, which resulted in the creation of a
long-lasting Akron chapter of the Oxford Group that Dr. Bob joined.
Unfortunately, Russell Firestone soon went back to drinking.

<p>
All of those claims of great success are biased by the usual stunts:
<ol>
<p><li>  Cherry-picking &#8212; recruiting only those alcoholics who are
ready to quit today, and willing to get down on their knees before Dr. Bob
and &quot;make a surrender&quot;. Only recruiting that kind of alcoholic
reduces the failure rate a lot.

<p><li> Observational selection &#8212; counting the successes and ignoring the failures.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Those drunks didn't try hard enough. They didn't pray enough. They weren't <i>Maximum</i>.
They didn't make a complete surrender. They didn't follow the program right. They didn't <i>Keep Coming Back</i>
to enough meetings.
So they don't count &#8212; they weren't really members &#8212; so we
won't count them and let them pull down our averages.&quot;
</font>
<p><li> Unverified numbers &#8212; Just because a few guys in a meeting say they haven't had a drink
in years doesn't prove it.
<p><li>
Assumption of a cause-and-effect relationship, plus claiming undue credit
&#8212; Just because some guy quits drinking and then goes to
some Oxford Group or Alcoholic Anonymous meetings does not prove or
even indicate that the meetings made
him quit drinking. That ignores all of the other (real) causes, like
the desire to stop suffering and being
so sick all of the time, and the desire to save a job or marriage, or
the desire for a better
quality of life, or just the desire to not die.

<p><li>
No follow-up &#8212; Did they ever revise their numbers when they discovered
that their poster-child sober alcoholics had gone back to drinking? I don't think so.
(The first-edition <i>Big Book</i> story writers who relapsed had their
stories silently removed from the second edition,
without a word of explanation or correction.)

<p><li>
Wild exaggeration and outright lying &#8212; The Oxford Group was notorious for exaggerating and
lying about everything else,
so I don't see why they wouldn't also lie about their success rate in sobering up alcoholics.

</ol>

<p>
Francis Hartigan was Lois Wilson's private secretary. He wrote a book about Bill Wilson that said:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We have to wonder why both the Wilsons and the Smiths did not simply give up.
Today the nation's best alcoholism treatment centers report success rates
ranging from 25 percent to 50 percent. During Bill's stay in Akron,
he and Bob calculated their success rate to be about 5 percent, and among
the few who seemed to catch on, not all of them were able to maintain
consistent sobriety. The first edition of AA's <i>Big Book</i>, published
in 1939, contains the personal recovery stories of many of AA's earliest
members. Some years later, Bill made notations in the first copy of the
book to come off the press, indicating which individuals portrayed therein
had stayed sober. A good 50 percent of them had not.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hartigan">Francis Hartigan</a>, pages 91-92.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So Bill's wife's secretary Francis Hartigan reported that Bill and Bob had only a 5% success rate in Akron,
and then half of their success stories relapsed?
That kind of conflicts with the 75% success rate claims.
<br>
(More on that <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses">here</a>.)

Oh well, have a good day anyway.
