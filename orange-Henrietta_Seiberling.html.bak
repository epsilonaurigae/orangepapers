<h2>Henrietta Seiberling - without her would be no AA in this world</h2>
</center>
<p>

This is an 8 page (4 pages/2 sided) letter from Henrietta Seiberling to
Clarence Snyder written on Friday, July 31st and postmarked August 1, 1952
from Akron, Ohio. The back flap of the envelope states - GATE LODGE NORTH
PORTAGE PATH AKRON, OHIO interesting to note it was called Gate Lodge rather
than Gate House which is usually used in AA literature. This is one of
about 6 letters to Clarence from Henrietta that we have. Here is the transcription
of that letter from Henrietta's handwriting. Also attached are copies as
scanned from the original letter.

Friday, July 31st, 1952
<br>Dear Clarence,
<p>It was such a happy surprise to get your
<br>letter - I have wanted to answer it long before
<br>this but have been &quot;burning daylight&quot;
<br>as the old saying goes.
<p>My Dorothy &amp; I drove here from New
<br>York July 4th &amp; she had 3 weeks here only
<br>&amp; I had been notified by the Seiberling brothers
<br>&amp; sisters that they felt they should rent my
<br>house, as we are here so little, so John &amp; his
<br>wife &amp; baby came as soon as I could get it
<br>opened &amp; ready, &amp; Mary &amp; her husband came
<br>from Chicago for a week; all to go over &amp; col-
<br>lect their belongings, piling up for 29 years.
<br>So you can imagine that I've stayed away
<br>from pen &amp; paper.
<p>I drove back to New York Sunday with
<br>Dorothy - car loaded with things &amp; Fred picked
<br>me up &amp; drove me back Tuesday. I see
<br>John off next week &amp; then, as usual, Henrietta
<br>really will tear into things - &amp; finish up -
<p>It was a terrific blow - the thought
<br>of not having this sweet little place to come to
<br>&amp; enjoy the beauties of nature, trees, birds, sun-
<br>shine, &amp; quiet &amp; to be with
<br>&nbsp;</font></td>

so many good friends. &amp; at first, I didn't know
<br>how to take it - so I just surrendered it &amp; asked to
<br>be shown what to say + what to do + put myself out
<br>of the picture entirely &amp; let God show me - after
<br>a few days, I think I was guided to have the
<br>right attitude &amp; wrote my brother-in-law a letter
<br>to which he responded the next day, with many
<br>thanks &amp; much appreciation. &amp; since we've been
<br>back I feel a warmth of affection from Fred's
<br>brothers &amp; sisters, that in the end, means more than
<br>even my haven of my own joy &amp; tranquility.
<br>&amp; so God works things out for us always &amp;
<br>I realize that we have to have things like that
<br>to make us turn to Him &amp; rely completely on Him.
<br>&quot;The branch that beareth not fruit, He cuts off
<br>but He purges the branch that beareth fruit&quot;
<br>so it &quot;will bear more fruit.&quot; I realized that it was
<br>just another challenge to meet, so that I would
<br>rely more completely on His direction, &amp; I knew
<br>that relying on &quot;His direction, I would &quot;never
<br>be misled&quot; I may work something out, renting
<br>the house furnished or move the furniture here
<br>to the Big House &amp; I can stay there when I
<br>want to I know.
<p>I was so interested to think of your being
<br>in Georgia &amp; seeing Roland &amp; Dorothy - They
<br>are such dear wonderful

real people &amp; I think we can be so grateful to
<br>our Maker for &nbsp; &nbsp; giving us a fel-
<br>lowship with so many all over. all with
<br>the same purpose in life &amp; trying to live the
<br>same quality of life.
<p>Last night, Bill Van Horn &amp; Mickey came
<br>over and got me &amp; we picked up
<a href="#Dotson">Bill Dotson</a>, who
<br>now lives near King School, &amp;we went out to Stow
<br>where I led the little group in a meeting - It
<br>was just like old times at T. Henry's - Every
<br>one felt they could get up and talk &amp; you could
<br>feel that we were really gathered together in
<br>His Name &amp; we had the real fellowship of the
<br>&quot;Holy Spirit&quot; that was left in the world, so
<br>we would never &quot;be comfortless&quot; - Bill Dotson
<br>said he had been to Albany, Georgia to speak.
<br>I told him that I had your letter &amp; they were
<br>so glad to get news of you &amp; spoke of you in the
<br>meeting.
<p>I feel very sure that God has His Guiding
<br>Hand on our works,
<font color="#9F0000">It looked for a while as
<br>if Bill Wilson would like to crowd God out</font>
<br>but we know that it is up to us to seek more &amp;
<br>more of God's power to help other people to know
<br>this way of Life &amp; our fellowship. You certainly
<br>are doing your part &amp; thank

God, all those who have glimpsed the real vision
<br>are doing theirs. The joy of it is, to me, that those
<br>who have only been offered &quot;the stone,&quot; are so
<br>eager &amp; grab at the &quot;bread,&quot; that we know we
<br>have to offer - as you say, it is appalling how
<br>ittle they have been offered by the would be
<br>"elder statesman" - but the 12 steps &amp; the
<br>fact that, as Stanley Jones say, wherever man
<br>opens his mind to God, He reveals himself -
<br>they have helped the groping AA's
<font color="#9F0000">-who have
<br>been denied so much of the real &quot;bread&quot; -
<br>&amp; given the &quot;stone&quot; of Bill Wilson's designs.</font>
<p>But, Clarence, I have made one big whale of
<br>a surrender of <font color="#FF0000">Bill &amp; his schemes -</font>
<br>&amp; all thought of him &amp; the possibilities of what
<br>harm he could do just left me in the most
<br>amazing way. I don't have to try to &quot;not think
<br>of him&quot; again, I just don't - He is completely
<br>consigned to God by me &amp; I know He can
<br>handle him - <font color="#FF0000">We will be closely knit -
<br> even with his taking the money &amp; trying to take
<br> the book. I am sure he will need our pity
<br>&amp; compassion because he has put himself
<br>apart from the real fellowship -</font>

Chapter of Luke</a> that I
<br>read in answer to my asking to

<br>that Christ didn't finish, &amp; according to Horace
<br>he said he was a reincarnation of Christ.
<br>Perhaps he got mixed in whose reincarnation
<br>he was. It looks more like the works of
the
<br>devil but I could be wrong. I don't know what
<br>is going on in the poor deluded fellow's mind.
<p>He must be wistful. He asked Bill Dotson if he

I learned from a Texas friend that a Chaplain
<br>in the prisons said the only way they really reached
<br>prisoners was thru Alcoholics Anonymous, even for
<br>the non alcoholic - so besides such things as
<br>that, <font color="#9F0000"> Bill &amp; his schemes pale into insignificance

<p>I realize that what may seem the

<br>may be the opening of many more doors &amp;
<br>vistas, so maybe it is a release for me to go

Billy was thru his school &amp;Bill planned to go
on
<br>a fishing trip with him &amp; he came home one
<br>night &amp; found she had taken off. He learned
<br>she went to California. The little boy was the
<br>apple of Bill's eye, but he will &quot;bear more fruit&quot;
<br>for this last challenge to meet &amp; he seems to
<br>know that &quot;bearing fruit&quot; is what we are here for.
<p>He is going to take me up to Cleveland to their
<br>Luncheon group some time. Maybe in the course
<br>of time, I'll meet Ed Howe. But it's like the 'father
<br>who seeth in secret,' that matters. Just so we
<br>keep His Guidance, which is so very real, I know
<br>nothing else really matters, as you know too.
<br>
<p>Do let me know what's going on with
<br>you, Clarence - I'll probably be here until the

<p>It is unnecessary to say &quot;keep up your

<a name="Dotson">*</a> <a href="orange-bill_d.jpg" target="newwin">Bill Dotson</a> was a
lawyer in Akron, Ohio. His story is in the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;. Look for
&quot;AA Number Three&quot;. Bill D. is also the man in the hospital bed in the chapter &quot;A
Vision For You.&quot;
<p>
Bill Wilson said this of him:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
So then Dr. Bob and I talked to the man on the bed, Bill Dotson, who some
of you have heard, A.A. No.3. Here was another man who said he couldn't
get well, his case was too tough, much tougher than ours besides he knew
all about religion. Well, here it was, one drunk talking with another,
in fact, two drunks talking to one. The very next day the man on the bed
got out of his bed and he picked it up and walked and he has stayed sober
ever since. A.A. No.3, the man on the bed.
