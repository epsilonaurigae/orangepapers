Subject:  	Horror Story of 12 Step Eating Disorder Treatment<br>

<p>
Agent Orange,

<p>
I really like your website. I was suspicious for a really long time about the steps
but I couldn't really put my finger on what was wrong with them. I'm glad to see
that I'm not alone. I wanted to share my horror story with you because I don't know
where else to tell it, and maybe if it gets posted with your answered letters,
someone else will find it and be able to identify with something in it.

<p>
I've never been in AA or NA, but I used to be very ill with an eating disorder and
spent a long time in an inpatient treatment center for it. Like most easting
disorder facilities, they claimed not to force any one particular treatment method,
but to offer a variety. I found out in time that this was not true: the facility's
operation had ideas from the 12 steps in basically all its treatments. One of the
most emphasized groups was called &quot;Addictions&quot; which was really Anorexics and
Bulimics Anonymous. We used the ABA book, but despite this, they kept telling us it
wasn't 12 step based. The first time I went to this group, the facilitator demanded
that I admit powerlessness over my bulimia. I refused and told her that I was not
powerless: I knew that I could learn how to control it, but just needed some help to
know how. I had a lot of traumatic events in my past, so I went into treatment
thinking they would help me learn how to deal with memories of these
and then I would be able to stop the bulimic behavior. I was so wrong: this
facilitator did not care about the fact that I had serious trauma to work past from
having been raped and abused as a child. When I told her that this is what I came
to the treatment center to work on, she said, &quot;If that's what you want to work on,
go somewhere else. We're here to make sure you don't binge and purge yourself to
death. You can make it easier on yourself by just making your first step. Until you
do that, we can't help you.&quot; I asked her what if the 12 step method isn't the right
method for me (like the admissions associate had told me, different treatments work
for different people), she told me I was in denial and headed for death. Another
day during group, I challenged the idea that God can be anything in the 12 steps. I
asked her, &quot;If God can be anything, and we could each potentially have a different
God, and God could be the group or the therapy dog or a
paintbrush, doesn't that mean that a 'god' isn't really necessary for being well?
Doesn't that mean you're just improving your habits on your own?&quot; She responded by
telling me again that I was in denial, and that I was wrong and would realize it in
step 4, as one of the step 4 questions was &quot;Do you judge the higher power of others
in the program?&quot; I tend to have a traditional Judeo-Christian idea of God, and
someone else in the group told me that I should have a different higher power for
ABA than my God for my religion. I couldn't believe it. What's that &#8212; spiritual
schizophrenia? And of all things, the group leader told me that I needed to listen
to what that girl was saying!

<p>
Here's the real horror story: after leaving the facility, I lost my job because of
ABA and the treatment center. While at the treatment center, I became known as one
of the worst rebels. I hadn't entered treatment wanting to rebel, but after I
entered and felt oppressed by the staff and the crazy steps I started to demand what
I knew I actually needed, and no one listened to me. I had signed myself into the
treatment center with an agreement not to leave before 60 days, which was a huge
mistake, and I spent my entire $60,000 savings on treatment because my insurance
refused to pay, so I was pretty depressed upon leaving. As a fully grown adult with
a successful professional career, I was appalled by the fact that I had wasted so
much time and money not to have people help me, but to have people controlling my
every move... and to believe that they were &quot;helping&quot; me because that's what they
said they were doing. When I got out, I started to find that there
were other ways of recovery from eating disorders. I started receiving excellent
trauma treatment and getting better. But then my &quot;sponsor&quot; who I met at the
treatment center started calling me and showing up at my work. The ABA program was
forced on me, and I didn't even choose this sponsor. That awful facilitator had
assigned her to me. This sponsor questioned the treatment I was choosing to
receive and told me that if I didn't stop and begin coming to meetings, she was
going to tell my boss about my eating disorder. She started telling my to try this
weird treatment, called EMDR, which I later found out was quack therapy too. I
spent $500 on EMDR sessions before quitting that. I tried to get a restraining
order against this sponsor because she was trying to control me and was threatening
to get me fired from my job. The judge didn't grant it because he didn't believe my
story when I told it to him. So a few days later, when I told my sponsor to go
to hell and that I had quit the EMDR and gone back to my other therapy, she freaked
out, called my work, and told everyone at every level above me that I was &quot;terribly
sick and in desperate need of treatment for bulimia.&quot; She even made up stories
about my stealing food from work &#8212; completely untrue. As a result of these lies, I
lost my job. I confronted her about this, and she told me that she had to force my
rock bottom to get me back into treatment. Deplorable.

<p>
Eventually, I had to move to a new city to get away from all this. I have a new job,
but I had to start from the very bottom whereas I had previously had a bright
career. It has been three years and I still haven't built my way entirely back up
the ladder yet. This is entirely the fault of ABA and that horrible sponsor.
Hopefully someday I will have what I once had, but for now I'm just grateful to be
out of the situation I was in before. And once I moved and kept working on the
trauma, I actually recovered. I'd like to shove that in the face of all those at the
treatment center, but for now I just want to be away for it all and actually live my
life. I just want the world to know that the 12 steps can be really dangerous, and
sponsors, in an organization with no formal hierarchy, can be dangerous.

<p>
Thanks for listening.

<p>
Catherine

Hello Catherine,
<p>
Thank you for the horror story. I will certainly print it.
<p>
My first reaction was, &quot;Sue the bastards.&quot;  The so-called treatment center perpetrated a fraud and lied
to you about the nature of the treatment and cheated you out of $60,000. You have both a criminal and
a civil case against them. Now I don't know what the statute of limitations is there. I'd check that.
<p>
The so-called &quot;sponsor&quot; who made you lose your job is also a good candidate for a lawsuit for slander.
<p>
And yes, I hope other people will be warned by your story.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better now, and getting some treatment worthy of the name.
<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
Interesting and huge body of work you have put together.  Clearly a
passionate undertaking.  I am interested if you have any references to
enlighten other paths of recovery.  I am especially interested in other,
less &quot;cult-like&quot; approaches such as RR and their success rate.  Your
statistics indicate that those in AA will likely fall away.  So what does a
person do?  I'd think one would want to be following a program that works.
I know people  who have seemingly benefitted from AA but then, your
statistics indicate that this is a temporary condition.

<p>
What has your experience been with other approaches?  I am told that AA's
share their experience and talk about themselves.  Do you have a story?  I'd
be very interested in hearing it.  You clearly have thought a lot about
this.

<p>
Thanks,

<p>

Subject:  	Re: Alcoholics Anonymous as a Cult<br>

<p>
I debated whether or not to reply to your latest email, and I decided that I
wouldn't, but I felt that I had left some things unsaid.

<p>
You state that you are not an atheist or agnostic, but you clearly do not believe in
God. Although you don't believe in God, you seem to have no problem playing God.

<p>
There is a God and you are not Him.

<p>
You talk to me about spirituality, and yet I wonder if you know what that is. I
don't think there is anything spiritual in telling people that AA is killing people.
Your intellectual dishonesty knows no bounds.

<p>
You got sober on self will....good for you, but that wouldn't work with the people I
know and love.

<p>
Our group purpose is to stay sober and help others to achieve sobriety, and we do
that through love and service.

<p>
Perhaps that is what is missing from your musings about AA. I don't feel the love!!

<p>
Have a good day....unless you have made other plans.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Al,
<p>
Well, you got just about every point wrong.
<p>
<ul>
<li> I do believe in God, in some kind of superconsciousness embedded in the fabric
of the universe. I do not believe in the nasty Old Testament tyrant who murders
non-Jews by the hundreds of thousands because they believe in the wrong god.
And I do not believe in a Santa Claus who brings goodies if the children behave
themselves. I think we can safely dispose of those grim old fairy tales.
But I am neither an agnostic nor an atheist.

<p><li>
I do not &quot;play God&quot;. What makes you think that I am &quot;playing God&quot;?
The fact that I believe in self-reliance and thinking for myself, and using my God-given intelligence
to save my own life?
<p>
If that bothers you, then you are merely promoting
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nazi_social_philosophy" target="_blank">the old Nazi God of Frank Buchman</a>.

The Nazi philosophy declared that the average man was unfit for thinking for himself,
and he should just obey the orders of his superiors. Is that what you are pushing?
&quot;God&quot; as <i>der F&uuml;hrer</i>?
And thinking for yourself is &quot;playing God&quot;?

<p><li>
Please define &quot;spirituality&quot;. And please tell me what is so &quot;spiritual&quot;
about foisting an old pro-Nazi cult religion on sick people and lying to
them about how well it works as a cure for alcohol or drug addiction.
<p>
Personally, I think that is pretty Satanic.

<p>
Please notice that there is a huge difference between &quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;superstition&quot;.

<p><li>
Yes, there is something spiritual in telling people that AA is killing people.
That is the truth. Those are the facts. Even your own trustee,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant found that A.A. produced an
&quot;appalling&quot; death rate</a>, the worst death rate of any method of treating alcohol abuse that
he studied. Frank Buchman's cult religion just does not cure alcohol abuse. It makes things worse.

I work very hard at making sure that everything I say is accurate and true.
Most of my statements are documented by reliable sources, or by A.A. council-approved literature.
Bill Wilson is actually the single-most-quoted person in the Orange Papers.

You think that I am lying? Well then, why don't you tell us what your opinion of the truth is?
And tell us where you get your opinions? I mean exactly where &#8212; book or journal name,

It's easy to make sweeping accusations like &quot;intellectual dishonesty&quot;, but how about some solid facts?
Why don't you tell us what the real A.A. cure rate actually is?

That is just some slogan-slinging. Lots of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#glittering_generality" target="_blank">glittering generalities</a>. 
If you really loved alcoholics you would give them something that works, not old disproven superstitions
from the nineteen-thirties.

<p><li>
Lastly, you think that &quot;the love&quot; is missing from the Orange Papers?
No, it isn't.
What about &quot;the love&quot; being absent from A.A.?
There is nothing loving about foisting quackery on sick
people and lying to them about how well it works to cure their sickness.
And then spouting a lot of grandiose self-congratulatory slogans at them like
&quot;love and service&quot;.
The most loving thing that you could do for the sick alcoholics is tell them the
truth about everything. That's what I am doing.

Have a good day now.

Here's a 12-step friendly (ugh) website where commentors mention you once in
a while:

I was wondering.  When I had to rehab I searched Bill's awful book for any
reference to a &quot;sponsor&quot; or &quot;sponsorship&quot; and didn't find any.  Sponsors
certainly aren"t mentioned in 12 practices.  Is there a link on your site
that details the history of the whole sponsor thing?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Steve,
<p>
Thanks for a good question. I don't have one web page just about sponsorship,
but do have a bunch of odds and ends references and tidbits.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
First off, sponsorship was an Oxford Group practice. In the O.G., your sponsor was the person who recruited you
into the cult and &quot;changed&quot; you.
It was mentioned here, in Beverly Nichols' stories of the Oxford Group:<br>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#original_sponsor" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-rroot090.html#original_sponsor</a>


<p><li>
Bill Wilson avoided using the term &quot;sponsor&quot; in the <i>Big Book</i> because he was hiding the similarities
between Frank Buchman's cult and Alcoholics Anonymous. Bill wanted people to believe that A.A. had
just magically sprung up from nowhere, or had been just magically handed down from God, or that
Bill had just spontaneously invented it, or discovered it. No way did he want people to know that
A.A. was just a copy of the disreputable pro-Nazi Oxford Group cult,
so most of the Oxford Group terminology was eliminated or renamed or hidden.
All references to sponsorship were censored from the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
Sponsorship was not mentioned, but it very much existed and continued in A.A.

<p><li>
When Bill Wilson (and Tom Powers) wrote his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
thirteen years later,
Bill dropped the pretense and talked about sponsorship a lot. He raved about how the sponsors were wonderful wise
teachers who carried the message and preserved the spirituality, and on and on.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
We had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence.
Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned,
it was a total liability.
Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a mental obsession
so subtly powerful that no amount of human willpower could break it.<br>

At this stage of the inventory proceedings, our sponsors come to the rescue.
They can do this, because they are the carriers of A.A.'s tested experience

&quot;... all you really need is a truly open mind.
Just resign from the debating society and quit bothering yourself with
such deep questions as whether it was the hen or the egg that came first.
Again I say, all you need is the open mind.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The sponsor continues, &quot;Take, for example, my own case. I had a scientific schooling.
Naturally I respected, venerated, even worshiped science. As a matter of fact,
I still do &#8212; all except the worship part. Time after time, my instructors held
up to me the basic principle of all scientific progress: search and research, again
and again, always with the open mind. When I first looked at A.A. my reaction
was just like yours. This A.A. business, I thought, is totally unscientific.
This I can't swallow. I simply won't consider such nonsense.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Then I woke up. I had to admit that A.A. showed results, prodigious results. I
saw that my attitude regarding these had been anything but scientific.
It wasn't A.A. that had the closed mind, it was me. The minute I stopped
arguing, I could begin to see and feel. Right there, Step Two gently and
very gradually began to infiltrate my life. I can't say upon what occasion
or upon what day I came to believe in a Power greater than myself, but I certainly
have that belief now. To acquire it, I had only to stop fighting
and practice the rest of A.A.'s program as enthusiastically as I could.&quot;<br>

After &quot;hearing the Voice of God&quot;, good Oxford Group members had to submit

In that way, the group elders got to say what God <i>really meant</i>,

<p>
Hello,<br>
I wish you a Happy Thanksgiving. I am a bit perturbed, though, about your
rant on Bill Wilson and AA. Sure, you have some very plausible evidence on
his delusions, but I have met so many people where AA has helped them
recover from drinking themselves to death. I have heard many people say
after attending AA and in recovery that admit the Big Blue Book is
outdated, but they read it with that in mind and take the steps with
success. Do you have some sort of solution that works just as well? My
mother is drinking herself to death right now, which is how I found your
website. She is 64, and just had her first grandson 7 months ago. She does
not want help. I didn't read all 24 pages of your website, so maybe you did
have a solution?

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tina,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Last item first, there are not 24 pages in my web site. More like
423. I don't know what you were reading. Perhaps some archived old copy of the web site, somewhere.


<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous has not &quot;helped millions&quot;. That is the standard lie that A.A. tells. They are
forever claiming great success when they actually do not have any. What you have seen is some
people get a grip and take control of their bad habits and save their own lives.
That was their own choice, and they saved themselves by using their own will power and determination
and desire to live. A.A. had little or nothing to do with it.

<p>
And it does not matter how much some people have been brainwashed into believing that A.A. saved them,
and how much they parrot the poster-child speeches about how nothing worked until A.A. saved them.

<p>
You also did not see the people whom A.A. did not help, and who died or disappeared, so that creates the
illusory appearance that A.A. seems to help people. You see nothing but the true believer &quot;success stories&quot;
who &quot;keep coming back&quot;.
That is the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">observational selection</a>&quot;
&#8212; counting the hits and ignoring the misses.

<p>
The best single file for you to read about the A.A. success rate is:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
In that file are the summaries of many clinical tests and controlled studies of A.A. that found that A.A. just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raised the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
while failing to improve the sobriety rate in alcoholics at all.
A.A. also raised the rates of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">arrests</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters219.html#Walsh" target="_blank">cost of hospitalization</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">divorce</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">suicide</a>.
A.A. is just a fraud and quack medicine.
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your mother drinking too much. It's very difficult, nearly impossible, to get
someone to quit drinking when she does not wish to quit. Also, few mothers welcome their daughters running
their lives for them. And sending her to a cult religion won't help
any, either. Notice that A.A. will just rationalize their failure to help her by claiming that she didn't
&quot;really try&quot;, and she didn't &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;, and she didn't
&quot;work the Steps right&quot;.
A.A. is quick to steal the credit for all success stories that happen
in the neighborhood of an A.A. meeting,
but they disavow any responsibility for the failures.
That is also observational selection.

<p>
But you can try to help her. Talking sense about the damage that alcohol causes to her might help.
Talking about the costs of drinking versus the benefits of drinking might help. That is one of the
tools that SMART teaches. Also ask yourself why she is drinking so much. Has she decided that her
life is over? Is she just old and lonely? Is she depressed about something?
Is she in poor health? Does she have an ulcer? Does she smoke cigarettes?
Has she been checked out by a doctor?

<p>
You might get some practical hints and techniques from members of the non-cult recovery groups, listed here:

Subject:  	The self esteem issue<br>

<p>
Hello!

<p>
I would like to ask you about the self-esteem. I've been sober for 3 years. The
first year I went to Na meetings a LOT, the last 2 years I just go randomly once in
a while. After the first year I started  to see so many disturbing things, such as
my sponsor who was younger than me, told me how to live, whom to date or not to date
stuff like &quot; The first year you buy a plant, the second year you get a job, the
third years you can have a cat, and the fourth year fix your economy and the fifth
year you can go on dates&quot; For cry it out loud, I was 40 years old when I got sober!
Ok, then my therapist always told me to Believe in yourself, DO what you feel is
right for you, we are all individuals. But my sponsor said, I do not have a sponsor
anymore, as I feel better without any!  ( as do a lot of Na people: Its your disease
talking, there are no special cases, we addicts are all the same!

<p>
That is SUCH BULLSHIT! We are ALL special and NO one is the same. This is in my
opinion really really bad things to say to other people that already have o low
self-esteem.
<p>
My therapist was really shocked when I told her. Ok, i have a lot of stuff to tell,
but I think you know these things already, I just wanted to share. Or i.e how can it
be a disease when in the next line they talk about moral shortcomings?
<p>
In my opinion I had a lot of problems and mental health problems that I self
medicated with alcohol and drugs, but I do not believe that I suffered from an
addiction before I used anything, that it was in me. I think addiction is built up
slowly, and you can also get rid of it. And I do not believe that every addict have
to attend 5 meetings/week for the rest of his life to stay sober. Fine if someone
wants to, but I have a lot of funnier stuff to do with my life.

<p>
I hope you leave my name and e-mail out if you publish my letter! I also know you
get a lot of post, so I get it if you do not have time to reply to everyone.

<p>
Thanks for great information!

<p>
Best wishes,

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello A.L.,
<p>
Thank you for sharing. Of course I totally agree with you. I especially like the line about:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... how can it be a disease when in the next line they talk about moral shortcomings?
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ah yes, you noticed that little gotcha, didn't you? How indeed?
What's with all of that jabber about moral shortcomings and wrongs and defects of character if
it's really a disease?
I don't recall the doctors talking about sins and wrongs and moral shortcomings when somebody catches
the flu or gets diabetes or coronary disease or cancer...
<p>
You also bring up the important point that use of too much alcohol or drugs is often caused by some other
underlying condition. I've read essays that asserted that at least 50% of all of the people who get
labeled &quot;alcoholics&quot; are actually people who have some other illness or condition that they are vainly
trying to fix with alcohol and drugs. Those patients have the right idea &#8212; fix what's broken &#8212; but they
are using the wrong medications (often because they are the only things that are available).
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better, and recovering without the cult.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life, now.

Hello A B,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to hear about your frustration. I certainly understand it.
I cannot predict the future for sure. I can't say whether the situation is totally hopeless,
or whether the odds of making that person see the light are merely the same as the chances of
a balloon in a pin factory.

<p>
People who have &quot;drunk the koolaid&quot; are pretty locked into their belief system,
and they see everything in terms of their ideology, and getting them out of it is unlikely.
(It's called &quot;apophenia&quot;, and we talked about it

Now some of them do eventually come to their senses, but it can take years, and
you probably cannot hurry the process any. Yes, I think you will be happier if you just move on.

A few months ago I read an article on your site about how NA had no effect

did have an impact. I cannot find which article that was, so I can't find
the citation for the study you used. Would you mind passing along the

Hello Will,

What you are thinking of is here:

<p>
It refers to this study:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Examined the relationship between sponsorship and abstinence in 12-step
treatment of injection drug users. 500 former and current injection drug users
(median age 39 yrs) reported sponsorship in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) at baseline and at 6-mo and 1-yr follow-ups. Results
show that having a sponsor in NA/AA was not associated with any improvement in
1-yr sustained abstinence rates compared to non-sponsored controls. However,
being a sponsor over the same time period was strongly associated with substantial
improvements in sustained abstinence rates, even after controlling for involvement
with community organizations, NA/AA meeting attendance, marital status,
employment, participation in drug and alcohol treatment centers, and HIV status.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
So newcomers getting 12-Step sponsors did not help them at all.
<p>
Note that the sponsors were a self-selected group. That study did not test whether making
randomly-chosen members into sponsors improved their rate of sobriety.
The study merely noted that those committed members who chose
to be sponsors drank and drugged less than other not-so-involved members.
<p>
There is room to argue that acting as a wise, honored, know-it-all teacher really does help some people
to stay sober  &#8212;  they can't stand the idea of being embarrassed in front of their students
by relapsing, so they stay clean and sober to keep up appearances.
That does of course suggest a really grim question: &quot;How many newcomers should they sacrifice to
keep the oldtimers clean and sober?&quot;

That's a huge amount of information to collate. It seems you have dedicated your
life to tearing down a program of recovery that has helped millions. I hope you get
eveything you want out of it. As for me, I think I'll stay sober another day and
live my life the way my higher power intended-free of addiction.

<p>
I just have to comment on your opinion of step twelve. Our traditions state it is a
program of attraction rather than promotion.  We certainly don't go recruiting. I
lead by example. People see that my life has gotten better in the last 8 years,
certainly beyond anything I thought possible. If they want to know how I was able to
turn my life around, I can show them. If they don't want to know, that's fine too.

<p>
Good luck in your search. By the way, this at the bottom of your rant says it all:<br>
Mike A.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>

Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your years of sobriety. Yes, your life does get better
when you quit drinking to excess. The same thing happened in my life too.

<p>
Well, your last line seems to be missing. I don't know what &quot;bottom of a rant&quot;
you tried to quote.

<p>
You started off with the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank">Big Lie</a>
 of A.A.: that A.A. has &quot;helped millions&quot;,
or &quot;saved millions&quot;, or &quot;sobered up millions&quot;. No it has not. A.A. is a total failure that merely
steals the credit for a few people who sobered themselves up by using their own strength, intelligence,
and will power. A.A. does not sober up alcoholics any more than
Scientology restores people to sanity.

<p>
We have discussed the &quot;millions&quot; claims of A.A. many times before.

<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters270.html#Jules_W" target="_blank">&quot;It saves millions of lives. Doesn't that matter to you?&quot;</a>

<li> <a href="orange-letters232.html#millions" target="_blank">&quot;...if it has saved millions, can it be so bad?&quot;</a>

<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="newwin142">Alcoholics Anonymous never saved millions of
alcoholics &#8212; that claim has been Bill Wilson's fraudulent claim from the very beginning</a>.

<li> <a href="orange-letters256.html#millions" target="_blank">&quot;Over two million worldwide ain't too shabby.&quot;</a>

</ol>
<p>
There are a zillion more, but I guess that will do for a start.

<p>
About Step 12: Of course I know about the phony &quot;tradition&quot; that says that A.A. is a program of
attraction, not promotion. I also know how hypocritical A.A. is as they gleefully take in all
of
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">the coerced people from the courts</a>
 and treatment centers.
And who do you think told the judges that sending those prisoners to A.A. meetings was a good thing?
And who works at the treatment
centers and tells all of the patients that they have to go to A.A. meetings?
(You can read about my child-raping 12-Step counselor
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
Now, what you didn't talk about is the single most important fact:
What is the actual A.A. cure rate?
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="newwin142">Look here</a>.)
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Terrance,

<p>
I really enjoy your web site.   I was reading tonight about the what seems like
hundreds of offshoots from AA...

<p>
and then I found this blog about Adulterers Anonymous:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221902/http://dsmoya31410.blogspot.com/2007/06/adulterers-anonymous.html" target="_blank">

<p>
My favorite line in the short discussion was:

<p>

<blockquote>

I just don't think it is wise to get people together who have a weakness for sex in
a room, introducing them to one another. You know what I mean? After the meeting, do
you want to go out for coffee and a BJ? I mean, come on.<br>

<p>
I nearly died laughing!

From:  	&quot;anthony c.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank You! Great Site!<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
Excellent web site indeed!<br>
Kudos to all the work you put into it  &#8212;  professionally done  &#8212;  well done!

<p>
I've been reading the information on your site, but lately
I've been spending more time reading letters from your readers.  It's quite obvious
when I read them (the
negative) that they come from people with static intelligence.  And I have to admit,
I read them for a bit of
free comic relief. I know that's a little twisted but they are entertaining
none-the-less.

<p>
My story is not different then some.  I attended a few AA meetings some time
ago.  The best way to describe my
experience was my &quot;Spidey Senses&quot; were tingling, and bad... a most uncomfortable
experience.  I was surrounded by sheep.  I couldn't ignore my
instincts.  My relationship ended with AA, abruptly.

<p>
I have completely obtained from alcohol for quite some time
now, simply because I chose not to drink any more.  I did it on my own.

<p>
To keep myself in check, I've been studying rational self
behavioral therapy, what I like to call &quot;Tools for the Thinking Man&quot; via. SMART
based on the REBT system...I think you may have made mention to it somewhere, I
think.

<p>
Now I haven't read everything on your site yet, so this
suggestion you may want to throw out the window.  I apologize if you have already,
or if you
have reason not to.  Perhaps you can
provide your readers some links or book suggestions related to behavioral
modification.  I've not only found it
helpful when addressing alcohol or drugs, but I find these tools useful for other
aspects such as understating other behaviors and emotions.

<p>
Thanks once again for the great site and keep up the good
work, it's most appreciated.

<p>
Anthony

Hello Anthony,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations on your recovery.

<p>
I totally agree about SMART and rational emotive behavioral therapy. I've mentioned them, and recommended them,
a bunch of times, but I don't mind mentioning them again.
<p>
First off, SMART is at the top of the list of non-cult recovery programs, here:
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>
<p>
Then, the &quot;Top 10&quot; reading list
(<a href="orange-top10.html#Ellis" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-top10.html#Ellis</a>)
 includes:<br>

<i>When AA Doesn't Work for You, Rational Steps to Quitting Alcohol</i>, by
Albert Ellis, Ph.D., and Emmett Velten, Ph.D.<br>

Dr. Ellis is of course the founder of SMART, and he teaches REBT techniques in his book.

<p>
I went to SMART for a while myself. That was several years ago, but I still have 11 years clean and
sober now. And that is in fact the path that SMART expects and recommends. You don't devote your life to
the group. You just go to meetings until you have learned all that you are going to learn, and then you
walk out and get on with your life.

<p>
Have a good day now.
