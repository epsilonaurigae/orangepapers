Subject:  	Addiction Disease<br>

<p>
Addicition is a disease according to the American Medical Association, has
been for fifty years plus. There's a fact for you. Bag on AA, but the
authority on disease definition has spoken, and people still ignore it.
Thought you might want to reconcile that part at the least.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Justin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Alas, we've been over this before, many times.
<p>
The AMA did not declare &quot;alcoholism&quot; a &quot;disease&quot; 50 years ago, they only said that it was an &quot;illness&quot;.
That was at the same time as they declared that cigarettes are okay for you. Really. In both cases,
that was just politics and money. They did no medical research to discover that &quot;alcoholism is an illness&quot;,
or that &quot;cigarettes are okay for your health&quot;. They just bowed to political pressure, and saw which
way the money went, and made some unfounded statements to please some noisy pressure groups.

<p>
Then, in 1992, the AMA let a joint committee of two A.A. front groups write up a totally goofy definition
of &quot;alcoholism&quot;. The &quot;definition&quot; is so twisted and illogical that it does not even say that alcoholism
is caused by drinking alcohol. No, it doesn't. They never say what actually causes alcoholism.
They just made the odd statement that &quot;alcoholism is characterized by drinking alcohol.&quot;
So they left the door open for someone else to declare that alcoholism has &quot;spiritual&quot; causes.

<p>
By the way, do you know what the AMA actually is? It is just a private club for doctors, whose goal is
to make more money for doctors.
About half of the doctors in the USA are members. Other doctors are strongly
opposed to what the AMA does.
The AMA is not the final authority on medical issues or diseases.
Check out the CDC and the NIH and the FDA for that.
<p>
The AMA has a very corrupt history. The president who built is up into what it is
today, Morris Fishbein, was convicted of racketeering for blackmailing pharmaceutical companies
into forking over lots of money to him (for full-page ads in JAMA), or else his AMA would not approve of their medicines.

<p>
Follow the money. It's all about the money. There is plenty of good money  &#8212;  billions of dollars  &#8212;  to be
made by foisting quack medicine on alcoholics and addicts. Best of all, the treatment won't work, so those
sick patients will <i>Keep Coming Back</i> for more &quot;treatment&quot;, again and again, as they
repeatedly relapse.  Foisting 12-Step treatment on sick alcoholics and addicts is a cash cow that never goes dry.

<p>
Here are some of the previous letters and answers about the AMA declaring that &quot;alcoholism is a disease&quot;:

<ol>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters28.html#AMA" target="_blank">Two A.A. front groups wrote the AMA definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot;</a>.

<p><li> <a href="orange-letters71.html#AMA" target="_blank">More on that goofy AMA definition of &quot;alcoholism&quot;</a>
<p><li> <a href="orange-letters223.html#AMA" target="_blank">More on the AMA and &quot;alcoholism&quot;</a>.

</ol>

<p>
Then, for giggles and grins, here is the AMA's first review of the A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, where
they said that the book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> is an unscientific piece of worthless proselytizing trash:
<ul>
<li> Look here:
<a href="orange-letters177.html#AMA_review" target="_blank">orange-letters177.html#AMA_review</a><br>
<li> and here:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#AMA_review" target="_blank">Analysis of the Propaganda</a>.
</ul>
<p>
You see, before A.A. had gotten rich, the AMA said that A.A. propaganda was bullshit.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hi Donita,

<p>
Thanks for all of the praise and compliments.

<p>
Alas, I cannot look up registrations by email address. It's just a limitation
of the Drupal forum software that I'm using. I can only look up registrations
by the user name that you used. And the message that the system gave you
about not recognizing the email address as a login name is not accurate  &#8212; 
you can't log in by email address, only by user name.

<p>
I checked for &quot;Donita&quot;, or anything like it, and there is no registration
by that user name, so obviously you used something else.

<p>
If you can tell me what user name you registered, I can fix it.

Jeez, I got all giddy for a moment &#8212; you are one of my hugest heroes/icons

No, really, I mean that as a compliment. Had it not been for y'all, I dunno

I'm making LOTS of new really cool friends! From all over the earth!  ...and

while. :)

I can't remember what logon name I used before, maybe NoAA4Rainbow (?) or

<p>
I decided to try another email address of mine &lt;xxxxxxxxxxxxx@xxxxx.com&gt; to make

Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. Ain't the Internet something else? You even get nice hoaxes. 
<p>
On that web page, &quot;The Damien Zone&quot; reported:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;This quote, printed over a photograph of the Dalai Lama, is floating around
on Facebook. It is inspiring millions of simple-minded Facebookers  &#8212;  but there's
a problem. HE NEVER SAID IT! There is no record of the Dalai Lama ever saying
this and on his website there is no mention of it. Devout followers of the Dalai
Lama say it is not true, but we live in the day where all one needs to do is put
something up on Facebook and it becomes the law of the land  &#8212;  at least where idiots are concerned.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<center>
<img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/Dalilama.jpg" width="640" height="427" border="0" alt="Dalai Lama">
</center>

<p>
Now I think that the Damien Zone is far too harsh in his criticism of people who believe reasonable-sounding
quotes. You don't have to be an idiot to believe that the Dalai Lama might have said that.
<p>
The rest of the page, and the following comments, make good points though,
about how misattributions can become so widely believed 
that, later, you will have a heck of a time trying to sort out what some historical person really said or didn't say.
In fact, the problem eventually becomes impossible, like trying to sort out what Jesus really said, and
what was added on later, or edited out, by legend and hear-say, and pious frauds &quot;correcting&quot; things.

<p>
Right here, we've had
<a href="orange-letters25.html#Spencer" target="_blank">a debate going on for years</a>
about Sir Herbert Spencer and the A.A. misquote that had him supposedly saying,

<p>
<center>
<table border="6" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="2" width="79%" bordercolor="blue">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

&quot;There is a principle which is a bar against all information,
which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man
in everlasting ignorance &#8212; that principle is contempt prior to
investigation.&quot;<br>

</font></td></tr></table>

<p>
Nice quote, but Sir Herbert Spencer never said it.
Michael thoroughly demolished that one, in his paper,
<a href="Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf" target="_blank">Survival_of_a_Fitting_Quotation.pdf</a>.
<p>
But it's believable. Sir Herbert Spencer said things that sounded similar:

<p>
We also had a big debate about whether President Abraham Lincoln ever told a joke about wanting to
send a barrel of General Grant's favorite whiskey to some other generals who had yet to win a victory.
(<a href="orange-letters7.html#General_Grant" target="_blank">Here</a>.)

And that quote is only 150 years old, not 2000.

It's almost enough to drive historians to drink.

Wow. So, I just skimmed through your page about AA and NA. I am so relieved
that I am not the only one who has noticed this about these strange,
cult-like groups. I have been attending nar anon for about two weeks now
and have had a lot of doubts about their &quot;program&quot; and ideas. Everyone
*who* I have talked to however seems to have nothing but positive
things to say.
<p>
Thanks so much for sharing a new perspective. Really opened my eyes to the

<font color="blue">
Hello Katherine,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks. And you are certainly not the only one. There are more and
more of us who are noticing that cult religion and quackery are unfortunately all too
commonplace, and commonly accepted, in the &quot;treatment&quot; of drug and alcohol problems.
<p>
Also check out
You will find lots more kindred spirits there.
<p>
About all of those people who have nothing but positive things to say about Nar-Anon (or A.A. or N.A. or Al-Anon),
yes, alas, the committed members are pretty thoroughly brainwashed. That is why they stay members.
And
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think" target="_blank">dissent is strongly discouraged</a>.

<p>
It's like a filtration process. The people who still have a working brain
and some remaining common sense walk out, leaving only the deluded true believers
at the meetings to tell you that Nar-Anon or N.A. or A.A. or whatever is really great.
<p>
But fortunately we have the Internet as another meeting place.

It says in the reading that rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly
followed our path. Key word.... Thoroughly. Most can not be honest enough to
thoroughly follow that path. Instead, they look for easier softer ways such as you

Hello Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. What you are describing there is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Lying With Qualifiers</a>.
Bill Wilson had a habit of telling tall tales, and making completely untrue statements, and then
inserting a little qualifier in there as an escape hatch for when people discovered that what he said was untrue.
In this case &quot;thoroughly followed our path&quot; is the escape from the lie that Bill Wilson rarely saw
people fail in A.A.
The truth is that Bill Wilson saw great numbers of people not get sober in A.A.
<p>
Another example of lying with qualifiers is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's completely untrue report of a great A.A. success rate</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, in 1955, in the Foreword to the Second Edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, page XX.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But who decided whether they had <i>really tried</i>? Well, Bill Wilson of course. With that qualifier, he
could fudge the numbers into being anything that he wanted them to be.
Of course the numbers are meaningless. But they sure sounded good.

<p>
Now, for your statements about &quot;honesty&quot;:
Alcoholics Anonymous is actually one of the most dishonest organizations
on Earth. It's right down in the gutter with Scientology.
They lie about everything from their history, to what the Steps do, to what Bill Wilson was,
to the ineffectiveness of the 12-Step program, to their honesty.  They even lie about their lying.
<p>
You claim that &quot;thoroughly following the path&quot; requires honesty  &#8212;
more honesty than the average person can handle. Well...
<ul>
<p><li>  What about quitting drinking?
Do you have to quit drinking alcohol to &quot;thoroughly follow the path&quot;? Isn't that more important
than your so-called &quot;honesty&quot;?

<p><li> What about working the Steps? Is that required to &quot;thoroughly follow the path&quot;? Bill Wilson said that
the Steps were optional, just a &quot;suggestion&quot;. (See page 59 of the B.B.)

<p><li> What about attending A.A. meetings? Bill said that was optional too, and he included the story <i>The Lone
Endeavor</i> in the first edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, about a lone wolf who never attended any A.A. meetings,
because there weren't any where he was. But Bill Wilson still considered him an A.A. member in good standing.

<p><li> What about telling the truth about A.A.? Do you have to do that to be honest?
Can the average A.A. member be honest enough to thoroughly follow that path?
<ul>
<li>
Can the average A.A. member handle honestly explaining how Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob were really recruiting people
for
<a href="orange-root090.html" target="_blank">a Fascist cult religion</a> in 1935 and 1936, because
Alcoholics Anonymous did not exist in 1935 or 1936, and it was not founded then, either? 
<li>
Can you handle being totally honest about how much of the A.A. history, like
<a href="orange-letters58.html#Mayflower" target="_blank">the story of Bill's Big Decision
at the Mayflower Hotel in Akron, Ohio</a>,
is actually a fairy tale that didn't happen because it was physically impossible?

<li>
Can you be honest enough to explain how Bill Wilson thought that Dr. Frank Buchman's crazy cult religion
was the cure for alcoholism, so
<a href="orange-root030.html" target="_blank">Bill just wrote down Frank's cult religion
recruiting and indoctrination practices</a>
and called them &quot;The 12 Steps&quot;?

<li>
Care to be honest about how Bill Wilson was really a
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">deceitful</a>
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">insane</a>

<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">philandering</a>
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">grandiose and narcissistic</a>
con artist who took A.A. for everything that he could get? ...Not a holy man at all. And not honest at all.

<li> Can you be honest about the fact that foisting Alcoholics Anonymous on sick people as a cure for
addictions  &#8212;  or not a &quot;cure&quot;, but a &quot;treatment&quot;  &#8212;  is a crime?
It's fraud and malpractice.

<li> Can you be honest about how A.A. sponsors are practicing medicine without a license?

</ul>

<p><li>
Care to be that honest, while you are boasting about honesty?

</ul>
<p>
I know that the &quot;honesty&quot; that you are talking about is just doing Step 5, and confessing everything
bad about yourself all of the time.
But that isn't real honesty. Real honesty requires stopping the speaker at the start of each A.A. meeting as he
begins to read out loud all of Bill Wilson's lies on pages 58 through 60 of the <i>Big Book</i>, and
telling what the real truth is, instead.  Now that's honesty. Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
all of the time.
<p>
Lastly, congratulations, you made the list. You are the umpteen-zillionth Stepper to accuse me of killing
alcoholics by telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="_blank">Here's the list</a>.
<p>
But you know that the truth is that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">it is Alcoholics Anonymous that raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
Your own A.A. Trustee Prof. and Dr. George E. Vaillant said so.

<p>
Of well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	Re: you did it<br>

<p>
hell man that lens is sharp and the price is right , never heard of it. I used to
pay a couple of thousand for a lens but that was because they were f 2.8 which meant
you could shoot much faster in lower light. but who needs it when now you can just
adjust your asa and get faster. i'm a nikon man myself but many of my friends are in
love with canon and I can see why , full frame sensor for one. hey keep shooting
can't wait to see whats next. jon

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Jon,
<p>
Yes, Panagor was an obscure brand that never got advertised much, and wasn't well-known.
In fact, nobody ever heard of it.
I didn't know about it until I read a Wikipedia page about Kiron and Kino Precision Optical.
Nevertheless, Kino seems to have put as much care into it as they did their other more famous lenses,
like the legendary Vivitar Series 1 70-210mm zoom lens.

<p>
And yes, I much prefer paying $120 rather than $2000 for a lens. That's why I like to try out old
legacy lenses.
<p>
The speed of the lens is not great. The aperture is fixed at F/8.  So it isn't exactly the same
thing as a $2000 giant white tube 500mm lens from Canon or Nikon. But a lot cheaper.
And in the summer sun, it does okay, as you can see.
<p>
One of the things that I hear about mirror lenses if that if they aren't really great, they are
really terrible. There are a bunch of cheap no-name mirror lenses for sale on ebay,
and from what I hear, they are trash.

<p>
Nikon makes a full-frame camera too, the D3 I think, but it's very expensive, and you won't find a cheap
one on ebay.

<p>
Nikon is nice. I have a couple of N8008 film cameras that are real jewels, and some old Nikon lenses
that I reuse on digital cameras with adapters.
Super-tough, high-quality construction (unlike the advertised &quot;Olympus build quality&quot;),
and the feel in my hands is a dream. Those cameras really make me wish I could insert
a new &quot;digital film&quot; module into an old film camera like the N8008. That would be fun.

<p>
I was considering buying a new Nikon D90 as my next
camera until I learned that Nikon had crippled the camera by making it turn off if
you mount a legacy lens on the camera. I couldn't believe it, and had to double-check
to make sure it was true. Nikon used to have
world-class backwards compatibility. Nobody was better.
You could mount almost any old Nikon or third-party NAI-mount
lens from the 'sixties or 'seventies on any new Nikon camera and it would work perfectly, no problem.
(The only notable exception being the famous fish-eye lens that stuck too far inside of the camera body.)
Great backwards compatibility. But not any more.  
If you mount an old Nikon lens on a new Nikon digital camera, the camera turns off and gives you a red
error message of &quot;No lens recognized.&quot;
Now, only the most expensive Nikon cameras will allow you to use old lenses.
So I sadly scratched Nikon off of my shopping list, and went and bought a used Canon 5D full-frame camera instead,
for about the same money.  Nikon just shot itself in the foot by pulling an Olympus stunt.
<p>
Yes, Olympus pulled a couple of dirty tricks like that on me, too.
Deceptive advertising to the max. I bought a new Olympus E-510 digital camera
because they were advertising &quot;in-body image stabilization works with any existing lens&quot;. But then I learned
that they turned off the image stabilization if you mounted an old lens on the camera with an adapter.
Even an old Olympus lens. 
(And of course I didn't figure that out until after the 2-week return period was expired.)
I had to post embarrassing messages all over the Internet for six months
to get Olympus to turn it back on. On dpreview.com I'm &quot;terrance13&quot;:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222010/http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1022&amp;message=25765524">

http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1022&message;=25765581</a>
</ol>
<p>
And after all of that, when Olympus finally turned on the image stabilization, they still refused to turn on
the focus confirmation. It is still non-functional with legacy lenses, and always will be.
And since the inferior viewfinder is not properly aligned, and you cannot see to do accurate manual focus,
that matters. Now the E-510 camera is discontinued, and there will be no further
firmware updates, or fixes for anything.
<p>
And that is just the start of my list of gripes about Olympus. When I get around to it, I'm going
to write the &quot;E-510 Memorial Web Page&quot; listing and showing
what is wrong with that camera, like auto-focus that doesn't
actually focus if it doesn't feel like it,
and auto-white balance that alternately gives you red and blue girls,
and the noisiest sensor in the industry, and that sensor has a very limited dynamic range and
blows the highlights all of the time, and a small dim viewfinder that they didn't focus properly,
and on and on. &quot;Olympus build quality&quot; is an obscene joke.
Now Olympus has given up and gone out of the DSLR business, and is just trying to foist small mirrorless
cameras without viewfinders on the public. Don't buy Olympus. Now I know that you won't, but I'm warning other
people.
<p>
Oh, and of course you probably heard about Olympus Corporation getting busted for
hiding $5 Billion of unexplained losses for 20 years, and
issuing false financial statements and deceiving their stockholders. 
So the corporate executives are so dishonest that they cheat both their customers and their stockholders. Unreal.
I just saw on the Japanese news TV program that several of the executives got sentenced to something.
<p>
Don't buy Olympus. Stick to Canon or Nikon for best results. Or Pentax is okay for some things.
<p>
Panasonic uses the same small noisy highlights-clipping &quot;Four-Thirds&quot; sensor as Olympus, so that's out.
In fact, Panasonic is the culprit that actually manufactures that inferior Four-Thirds sensor.

<p>
Sony is on my shit-list because they wouldn't honor
their warranty. They manufactured a bunch of defective sensors with cheap epoxy packaging that
eventually allowed water
vapor to seep in there and ruin the sensor. Those sensors ended up being put in Sony, Nikon, and Canon cameras. All of
those manufacturers promised to exchange the sensor for free, even if the warranty was expired.
I had one small Nikon point-and-shoot camera with the bad sensor, and three from Canon.
Both Nikon and Canon fixed the cameras for free. I made out like a bandit
buying defective Canon cameras from Goodwill and then sending them to Canon for free repairs.
I also had one small Sony camera with the dead sensor, and I double checked their web site before I bought it to make
sure that Sony would fix it. They said they would, but
Sony refused to do the advertised free fix and tried to charge me $100 for the &quot;free&quot; fix.
Even when their web site still advertised the free fix on two different web pages,
they refused to do it. So I won't buy any more Sony stuff.
<p>
Oh well, thanks for letting me vent. Have a good day now.

By the way, here's the cult member career I built for my Sims 2 game. It
won't do any good to attach the actual package file, so here's a text file
with job descriptions and chance cards, instead. Chance cards are pop-ups
that give you two options, which can either succeed or fail, and have a
chance of appearing while your sim is at work. You can ignore the chance
cards, but what fun is that? Also, job level 0 is unemployment, so if any
of the chance cards bring a sim to that level, they're fired.

<p>
Man, that game sounds like it would be a lot of fun. Pity I don't have much
in the way of programming skills. At least not yet.

<p>
I must say, I put that career in my game, and combined with the
already-existing cult leader job, it's a lot of fun. Cult leader gets to
live in a ginormous, obscenely expensive mansion, while the cult members
live in tiny little houses with no room to expand. Not that they can afford
to, anyway. I'm working on the second in-game week, and I already have
stuff that could fit in your horror stories section if it happened in real
life. For instance, I had two toddlers in two different families that grew
up without meeting a single milestone out of three, because the parents
were too busy being in the cult to teach their children anything. It's a
good thing that has no repercussions in the game, other than one of the
toddlers growing up completely miserable.

<p>
I also had my first suicide in the cult. A bachelor moved to the cult
island, in the hopes of leaving his past as a home-wrecker behind and
reforming. However, the 15-hour work days proved to be too much for him. He
could not keep a good cultish attitude, and as a result, he was kicked out
of the cult. He called and begged the cult leader to let him back in, but
he would not allow it. To add insult to injury, he was about to be kicked
out of his home. He ended up ordering an incendiary bomb and detonated it
inside his house. It was a final act of defiance from somebody who never
realized he was fighting the system.

<p>
As for the cats, I can understand why you find those cats spooky. It is sad
that they live off of ducklings, even though carnivores need to eat. Nature
can be brutal at times. A lot of rural feral cats seem to be like that.
That fits the feral cats around my mother's house pretty well. One of my
cats accidentally got left outside at night a couple of weeks ago, and
ended up in a fight with one of the ferals. She still has a scab on her
butt. She also no longer tries to get outside at night.

<p>
Of course, there are exceptions. One time, when I lived on a farm, this
little cat showed up on the back porch. Every time she saw a person, she
would come up to them and rub up against them. She purred all the time. She
would beg to be let in the house. Eventually, we let her in. She became one
of the cats I have today. Incidentally, when we took her in to get spayed,
we got denied the feral cat discount because she was too friendly. And
she's still a friendly kitten-at-heart.

<p>
So, what sort of personalities have you noticed with geese?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Meatbag,
<p>
Now that cult game really sounds like it has it's possibilities. I still have Sims 1, so I'm not sure what
I can do with it. I have played with it very little. I need to erase all of it and re-install it,
because they have a goofy system of you must install the game and expansion packs in the correct order,
and only use one CD as the key disk when trying to run the game. (Notice that I said, &quot;Trying to run the game.&quot;)
<p>
Yes, <i><b>Sim-Cult</b></i> could be a real laugh.
<p>
Speaking of which, are you hearing about Katie Holmes divorcing Tom Cruise, apparently because she
is afraid that Scientology is going to kidnap and brainwash her child?
I was wondering how long that marriage would last. I wasn't expecting it to last very long.
When you marry Tom Cruise, you are marrying Scientology.
<p>
Foisting Lafayette Ronald Hubbard's insanity on innocent children is a crime.
I'm glad to hear that Katie Holmes is going to save her child from that.

<p>
About those feral cats: It sounds like your friendly one had previous contact with humans, and was maybe
even somebody's pet that strayed, and was looking for a comfortable home again.
The feral cat that I saw along the shore of the Willamette River
was totally wild, born in the wild from a wild mother, and it had never had anything to do with humans,
and it feared humans and wouldn't get near them. It just hissed and glared at me.
It reminded me of a vampire that I saw in a horror movie.

Canada Geese have as many different personalities as people. And what is amazing is that they are born that
way. They come out of the eggshell with distinct personalities.
<a href="orange-letters233.html#goslings" target="_blank">Blondie</a>,
for instance, was the friendliest gosling I ever knew.
Ever, of any year, of any family (other than the goslings that I was raising, who considered me their
foster mother). He would look me in the eye and chirp &quot;hello&quot;
when he saw me, and come on over to see what munchies I had for him.
And he did that from the first day that we knew each other.

<p>
<center>

Blondie, flapping
</center>
<p>
Most of the other goslings didn't really chirp hello to me, they just chirped,
&quot;Oh goody! Munchies are here.&quot; There really is a difference there, and there is a specific chirp,
a rapid chatter, that says, &quot;Hello. Greetings. I'm happy to see you.&quot;
I see the goslings using it on each other, and kissing. Yes, they actually kiss.
First, they do their little &quot;Hello&quot; chirp to each other,
and then one lightly bites the lower part of the other one's beak, and then they reverse it, and the second
one bites the beak of the first one. They kiss.
<p>
The first time I saw them doing that, it was when I was caring for that first family of goslings.
We were in the park, and I was leading them around. Two of them decided to go off on their own to the left for
a few minutes while I led the others back to the food and water bowls. A couple of minutes later,
the other two rejoined us, and when they did, the goslings were saying hello to each other and kissing.
My reaction was, &quot;Good grief, you guys! You have only been separated for two minutes, and you are carrying on
like long-lost brothers.&quot; I guess two minutes is a long time to goslings.
<p>
With me, they said, &quot;Hey! Where's your beak? How are we supposed to kiss you when you don't have a beak?&quot;
So the goslings settled for pecking me on the end of the nose, the closest thing that I have to a beak,
or pulling my mustache.
<p>
Carmen was a cute little charmer.  She knew how to be a cute little girl. She had a very feminine personality.
That's how I was able to correctly guess her sex after just two days.

<p>
Others are more sociable or less. And more trusting or less.
And then there are the independent adventurous boys. There is often one
boy in a family who likes to go off exploring by himself. He is the first one to leave the family for a 
whole day at a time, and go around exploring and having a good time. Then he returns to the family in the evening.
Those little guys often turn out to be alpha males.
The other kids will all tend to stick together in a flock, but &quot;Indy&quot; is a loner.
Yes, I had an &quot;Indy&quot; in that first family of goslings that I cared for, and that's what I named him.
He was both like Indiana Jones, always going off on an adventure by himself, and also just &quot;independent&quot;.
And then Indy often had a side-kick. One of the others would occasionally follow him around.
Indy was clearly the leader, and the other was a follower.

<p>
I only ran into one bad-tempered gander. There was this one big old gander who would deliberately bite
my hand when I was feeding them. All of the other geese were careful not to bite my fingers when I was
giving them bread  &#8212;  the females were even dainty as they carefully took the bread from my fingers  &#8212; 
but there was just this one guy who was so macho that he had an attitude of,
&quot;I don't take hand-outs. I'm going to bite your hand and steal the bread from you.&quot;
He couldn't take a gift; he had to be a bad-ass goose.
One woman commented, &quot;He just has to show you who is boss.&quot;

Subject:  	Sensational<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I have thoroughly enjoyed the site and plan to spend even more time in the future. I
was VERY close to swallowing the Kool-Aid in AA, but could not explain one thing...
What in the hell did I have a stronger craving for alcohol AFTER a meeting than
before? Every time without fail.

<p>
I actually did a 4th step and half of a fifth step before sanity prevailed. I was
sitting in a room off of the main hall with my sponsor and another member going
through my lists of &quot;sins&quot;, when it hit me. I'm telling a guy who spent 8 years in
prison and another guy who basically abandoned two children to the state my deepest,
darkest secrets that were nowhere near the level these guys stooped.  Insanity of
the highest order. I excused myself and promptly left the building. I won't be back.

<p>
Ever since I have stopped, the cravings for alcohol have decreased as well as a
general feeling of despair and dread that hung over me constantly while attending up
to two meetings a day. Dark, very dark is the only way I can describe my AA
experience. In fact, I believe that if you have any moral or religious beliefs at
all, every fiber of your being sounds alarm as you are sucked into the morass of AA.

<p>
Anecdotal? Sure, but it is my experience. Thanks for your hard work proving that I
am NOT crazy. Sober now for over a year by use of my own faculties.

<p>

Hello Chris,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and of course I couldn't agree more.
Congratulations on your escape from the madhouse. And I'm glad that you stopped your Fifth Step before they
got too much blackmail material.
And congratulations for your year of sobriety.

<p>
I also experienced A.A. meetings making me want to drink, and N.A. meetings making me want to get high on
drugs.
That's one of the reasons that I don't go any more. I'd be fine before I went to the meeting, but boy was I
thinking about it when I got out of the meeting.
Funny how that works. That is just the opposite of what is supposed to happen.
I don't know if it's osmosis, soaking up other people's desires, or just the power of suggestion,
spending an hour going down memory lane, but there is no doubt that those 12-Step meetings were reawakening
the old desires, making the vampire rise up from his grave.

<p>
Other people have reported the same thing too.
Life is just easier without that.

<p>
So have a good life now, and a good day.
<p>

Hello, I came across the orange paper and found it to be quite intriguing.
Unfortunately you take so much out of context and leave out any personal
experience which is where true wisdom comes from. If you have an
alternative method of treatment for the 'medical condition' called
alcoholism you surely did not reveal it. Which makes your page just a rant.
Go to a doctor and tell him your symptoms (drinking is a symptom) and he
will tell you that you 'may ne'er an alcoholic and to try an AA meeting and
call him in the morning.

Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
<ul>

<li>
First off, no I do not &quot;take things out of context&quot;, or &quot;quote out of context.&quot;
Just quoting things is not &quot;taking things out of context.&quot;
We've been over that so many times. We just covered that again in a recent letter, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters312.html#Walter_S" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters312.html#Walter_S</a>.

<p>
<li>
I actually include a lot of autobiographical information in my web site. At times I worry whether it is too much.
My personal experiences do not really have much to do with the A.A. failure rate.
Personal stories are often little more than
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof by Anecdote</a>.
My personal history does not increase or decrease the A.A. sobriety rate by a single percentage point.
The A.A. failure rate will be just the same, no matter whether I was in the Honor Society or lived on a hippie commune.
My personal experiences are pretty irrelevant when we are talking about how A.A. fails to help alcoholics.

<p>
Nevertheless, you can find a bunch of autobiographical information here:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters303.html#John_McC" target="_blank"> Autobiography for SOS</a>
</ul>

<p><li>
And it is not a question of whether I have &quot;wisdom&quot;. 
I get the feeling that you want each rap to begin with, &quot;Hi my name is Terry, and I'm an alcoholic.
By the grace of God and some wonderful cult or other I have not had a drink or a hit of dope in over 11 years.&quot;
Would that really make my facts any truer?

<p><li>
I most assuredly do tell people about what works. I've said it so many times that I fear that some
people may think that I'm a salesman for other programs or organizations.
Here is 
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">the list of non-cult organizations and methods</a>.

<p><li>
My doctor, and he was a good one, <i><b>never</b></i> told me to go to an A.A. meeting.
What he said was, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one. Now you know what the truth is, and I'm not going 
to waste my breath repeating myself. So you go do whatever you are going to do. But it would be a shame to
see a nice guy like you die when you have so much love to give.&quot;

<p>
I thought it over for a month, and drank on it some more, and thought about it some more, and finally decided to live,
and accepted the fact that my drinking career was over.
That was almost 12 years ago, now, and I haven't had a drink in all that time.
</ul>

<p>
Have a good day.
