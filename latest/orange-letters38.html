I wish there was a way to get a &quot;small&quot; synopsis of your excellent
web-site into a small pamphlet I could share with my DUI program clients
who are, unforturnately FORCED to attend &quot;self-help&quot;  (i.e. 12-Steps!)
group meetings as part of their program. You have a LOT of excellent,
and throughly researched information. I just wish it could be &quot;capsuled&quot;
for better distribution.

Hi John,
<p>
That's a good suggestion. I'll have to think about that and work on it.
In the mean time, the closest things are pages like:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-secrets.html">The 12 Biggest Secrets of A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-aalies.html">The 12 Biggest Lies of A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-not_good.html">What's Not Good About A.A.?</a>
</ol>

<p>
But still, obviously, they are all far larger than a pamphlet.
<p>
Pamphlets, another thing to do.
<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Rick M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>

Greetings,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Rick,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
</font>
<p>

<p>

Although I have been a member of AA for almost 8 months, I will provide a
few of my own observations. I average 9 meetings a week and have rarely
seen a new face. I doubt if  criminal charges for driving under the
influence has been suspended. After all, there are 14 bars within 4 miles
of my home and they all seem to have a booming business. There must be more
alcoholics out there unless they have truly found a better way or is there
something wrong with AA? Most likely.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I am not tying to engage in a debate in theological philosophy but would
like to render my views of AA and the Twelve Steps (to Nirvana?). They seem
to be rooted in traditions of the early Catholic Church &#8212; The
confessionals.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, confession is a very common cult practice. Even the Chinese Communist Party used it
in their brainwashing programs. It's very good for inducing feelings of guilt and
self-doubt, and weakening people and making them more obedient and compliant.
</font>
<p>

Speaking as a fundamental Christian, Jesus Christ never
taught or expected step work &#8212; except walking. The gurus of local AA groups
demand strict adherence to the steps &#8212; No religious beliefs allowed.
Whatever happened to &quot;suggested&quot; and &quot;guidelines&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>


My minister became quite distressed when he read that I am not allowed to
believe in God until the Third Step, that I had to write down my sins
(shortcomings, etc.) and confess before another person. According to
fundamental Christian beliefs &#8212; prayer is strictly personal, private and
confidential business between God and me &#8212; No Third person.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

He became severely upset when prayer and meditation did not appear until
the Eleventh Step and then finally, in the Twelfth Step, I am allowed to
volunteer my time, money and effort to appropriate causes.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Is Alcoholics Anonymous the Anti-Christ? Maybe AA should thoroughly
research the meaning of First Century Christianity, the origin and
subsequent actions of the official Church of Rome and other facts of the
time related to early Christians.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

My ramblings do have a lot to be desired but for a program that prides
itself in simplicity, there are implied complications and pitfalls.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Take care

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the letter Rick. I was especially interested to hear the reaction
of your minister. I have wondered for a long time now how the clergy could be
so silent about people being sentenced to Alcoholics Anonymous, given the basically
heretical theology. I know the ministers would protest if people were being sentenced
to the Catholic Church or Jewish Temple.
<p>
Oh, by the way, if your minister was upset by those items, then he really should
read the file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear O,

<p>

I can't thank you enough.  Your web site has saved my sanity.  The
internet has saved my sanity.  I am (was) a member of AA for 21 years.
I have been struggling so long to leave and have managed to do so for a
number of years.  There is so much to report and I am so tired.  I just
want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the work you have
done.  I knew AA was a cult and that I was brainwashed.  You are the
first person I have come across to address the issue.  Thank you so
much.  I will write again when I can.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Denisea,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your escape.
<p>
I'll look forwards to hearing from you again.

Subject:  	new book on teen help<br>

<p>

Hi Agent,

<p>

Hope you're well.  I absolutely love reading the mail you get and your
responses.  You'd think people would actually read your site before
going on the attack, but then again.... look at what influence they're under.

<p>

Maia Szalavitz has just released an amazing book called
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005532/http://helpatanycost.com/">Help At Any Cost</a>
on the ever increasing phenomenon of the
Troubled Teen Industry.

The book details the history and outcomes of
four different organizations...Straight (where I was), WWASPS (the
largest and most prolific of the organizations today), North Star
Wilderness (where
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Aaron_Bacon">Aaron Bacon</a>
died a slow, agonizing death from a
perforated ulcer) and finally KIDS of North Jersey a/k/a KIDS of Bergen
County (<a href="orange-gulags.html#Miller_Newton_book">Miller Newton</a>
of Straight's last hurrah and the program that
finally brought about his demise).  Maia is an incredible researcher and
tells the story in a way that connects all those dots I've been trying
to all these years.  It also makes it easy for the layperson to navigate
their way through the maze of shell corporations, shuffling of staff
accused of abuse to other facilities ala the Catholic Church w/ abusive
priests, off shore facilities and outright corruption and covering up of
serious abuses, even many deaths.  I highly recommend this for anyone
interested in the treatment of our youth today.  As has been evidenced
lately here in Florida by the death of Martin Anderson at the Bay County
Sheriff's Boot Camp (see connections to
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Sembler">Sembler and the DFAF f/k/a Straight, Inc.</a>)
the way we seem to view our teens as inherently flawed
and dangerous people and what we see as appropriate 'treatment' for that
is indeed sickening.

<p>

As always I'm constantly referring people to your site.  Many kids
coming out of these places feel so helpless.  They've connected with
each other through various websites<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005532/http://www.fornits.com/">www.fornits.com</a><br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005532/http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Groups.ListGroups&amp;Keyword=WWASP&amp;Submit3=Search">
http://groups.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Groups.ListGroups&Keyword;=WWASP&Submit3;=Search</a><br>

and
that's wonderful but they're also hungry for answers as to precisely
what was done to them, how and why.  That's when I send them over here.
You're work is a wealth of information for them.

<p>

Thanks,<br>
Kim

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Kim,
<p>
Nice to hear from you again, and thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
I'm glad to hear that Maia's book is out. I knew that she'd been
working on it for a year or two. I really like her writing style, and
she strikes me as being intelligent and knowledgeable. Above all, she tells the
truth, which is a bit of a rare commodity in this so-called &quot;recovery community&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	The ending of thought<br>

<p>

Hi Orange

<p>

*The past is all our accumulated memories. These memories act in the
present and create our hopes and fears of the future. These hopes and
fears are the psychological future; without them there is no future. So
the present is the action of the past, and the mind is this movement of
the past. The past acting in the present creates what we call the
future. The response of the past is involuntary, it is not summoned or
invited,  it is upon us before we know it.*<br>
* *<br>
*QUESTION: How are we going to be free from the past?*<br>
* *<br>
*ANSWER: To be aware of this movement without choice &#8212; because choice
again is more of this same movement of the past &#8212; is to observe the past
in action: such observation is not a movement of the past. To observe
without the image of thought is action in which the past has ended. To
observe the tree without thought is action without the past. The state
of seeing is more important than what is seen.*<br>

Subject:  	Re: Thank you<br>

<p>

Hey orange:
<p>
I have to write to say thank you. I don't know if you saved my life
or not, but you came along when I needed you most.

<p>

I have been sober and clean for 25+ yrs. I had it made or I should
say we had it made till my wife decided to get a sponsor. Life went to
shit in a handbag. Youngest son out the door, took the oldest ones keys
away because it was no longer his house. I was next because I said no to
some of this. Then the dog and lastly the cat.
<p>
This all took place in the course of three months. I went back to
aa simply because I had nowhere else to go and I had always given it
credit for saving my life.I thought I had found a whole group of new
friends.
<p>
I spent a ton of time on my knees praying for understanding in
this whole deal.
<p>
I know now there are levels of the misinformed within the program,
and some them are sicker than the sickest. I also know today that I am
not powerless over anything. One huge regret is that when my oldest son
came to me prior to Christmas last year and said its like she is in a
cult dad. Out of the mouths of babes, huh. I told him that its just that
group over there, we over here don't do it that way. BULLSHIT!
<p>
As I said I prayed a ton and after the divorce I was at work one
day and reading stuff on aa. How your site came up I will never know (oh
but I really do) because I was on aa's website. At any rate I started to
read and read and read, the answers came like a flood.  As I look back
on it now I see how caught up in it I was. I sat on this for a day or
two, you see I sponsor a young man that had about a year in and I didn't
know how I was going to tell him. I told him the truth. We have both
survived to date. Rather nicely I might add. Freedom from bondage is a
wonderful place to be. Pun intended.
<p>
Oh yeah, those really close friends we both had, well they no
longer come around, seein's we don't go to meetings anymore.
<p>
Orange, my prayers are with you every day, because I owe you at
least that. The answers I got from this deal have made my life better.
I think anyone who questions it and says they have a true belief
in God only need to get on their knees and ask. That uneasy, quesy, icky
feeling about two inches behind your belly button could be the answer
your looking for.

<p>

Thanks again Orange.

<p>

Subject:  	support letter<br>
Date:  	Thu, February 23, 2006 18:24<br>

<p>

Hi, I just recently came across your site, and plan to read it all,
havent covered it all, but Im comming to believe /half measures do not
fail me nothing, for Im learning so much from your postings.  I have
been in and out of the program for a year and a half, currently will
pick up a 6 month chip in less than a week, the longest Ive ever gone
&quot;sober&quot;.  I appreciate the program, I &quot;work&quot; a program (steps, have
sponsor, fellowship, ect.), and have met some good friends through
fellowship.  Im sure you often get letters like this, but your website
has opened my eyes so much to the &quot;cult&quot; aspect of A.A.  &quot;The Program&quot;
has helped me change my attitudes, in an AA setting.
<p>
I totally agree
with what your site says about AA promoting feeling guilty for being
guilty, and to feel guilty about having feelings, and how it all turns
into anger.  Outside of an AA setting (meetings, fellowship, ect.) such
as on my job, where I used to give 110%, was very charismatic
and outgoing person (even when hungover!), I'm now angry and bitter
at everything or everybody.  Since going back to AA, I have gone into
debt, since my sponsor (who I no longer have as a sponsor) demanded that
she tell me what to do with my finances, since they were so
&quot;unmanageable&quot;.  I followed direction, for fear of losing my sponsor and
not working my program right.  I have been taught, also, that &quot;I am not
a victim&quot;, that when someone says something or does something to me that
Im supposed to /look at my part/.   Even in the instance that I was
raped, I had to look at /my part/.
<p>

I have learned good things from the
program, but I heavily warn newcomers to watch out for the &quot;know it
all&quot; people.  Its even part of the AA program, in the literature it
states &quot;human reliance will fail us&quot;, and to rely on half of the nuts
that come to the tables for guidance, and to let them tell you that
something in your life such as your finances, romances, ect are
&quot;unmanageable&quot;, and if you dont believe them then &quot;your not working a
program&quot;, its best to go with your gut feeling or better judgement &#8212; a
mistake I failed to heed.

<p>
I now have a sponsor who I attend church
service with occasionally, and out of my own free will because I enjoy
it, not by direction.  I work the steps with her, and she has done
service work for me (she gave me a couple rides while my car was in the
shop), and doesnt try to cram a guilt/shame trip on myself, or try to
force me to believe anything.  Shes just one of the members who likes to
help out another alcoholic and see someone better their life.  She also
has 30 something years without a drink.

<p>
So anyhow, I just thought I'd
share my &quot;cult&quot; experience (the short of the long of it!) with you.  As
a member of AA, I do agree with you on the &quot;cult&quot; subject.  There are
just some people who take it too far, and push people into situations by
using fear and judgement.  I believe it has a good part in why AA isnt
as successfull as it /could/ be.  AA should be supplemental to life, not
detrimental.

<p>

Just trying to better my life,<br>
Angela

From:  	Tammy B.<br>
Subject:  	Don't stop exposing them<br>

<p>

Agent Orange,

<p>

I just want to say thank you for your site. I knew I could not be the
only one who saw there was something seriously wrong with this group and
their ideology and methods.  I myself am not a user of anything, but I
saw AA's effect on a couple of people I knew well.  They became weird,
totally different persons. One especially couldn't speak without
spouting AA slogans and mottos.

<p>

Now this cult has my 15yr old in its grip.  He smoked pot, got into
trouble and was sent to an AA residential program by the court. Having
seen what this group does, I am beside myself and want him out. Their
techniques amount to nothing more than sadistic mind control.

<p>

If you have any suggestions for legal leverage, please send me a link.
My son and I used to be close, but he is now well into the
indoctrination process, and since I do not accept it, they discourage
him from speaking to me.  AA is destroying my family.

<p>

Please keep up with exposing their lies.  Sooner or later, the knowledge
will spread and someday, an enlightened society will look back and
wonder how on earth such an organization ever became so powerful and
pervasive.

<p>

Sincerely,<br>
Tammy B.

Hi Tammy,
<p>
Thanks for all of the compliments. Sorry to hear about your troubles.
<p>
That question about legal aid is a tough one. Let me get back to you on that.
<p>
And have a good day.

From:  	&quot;durden&quot; <br>
Subject:  	the last stop, not the first<br>

<p>

hey orange,

<p>

I enjoy your probing of AA, I think any institution that can't take a
little poking at is bonk. It's my understanding however that AA does not
claim to be the ONLY solution for the drinking problem, but rather, the
LAST one.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Durden,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Yes, A.A. claims to be the last house on the street.
But it isn't. When we do a reality check and look at the facts, we see that
A.A. has a huge drop-out rate &#8212; greater than 95% in the first year, greater than 98% by
10 years. Very, very few alcoholics actually achieve and maintain sobriety in Alcoholics
Anonymous. And yet slightly over 50% of all alcoholics eventually quit drinking.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School reported that</a>.
<p>
So the real last solution is &quot;Either quit drinking by your own efforts, using your
own will power, determination, and intelligence, or die. Choose one.&quot;
<p>
That's the choice that my doctor gave me, and it worked. I now have over 5 years of sobriety.
</font>
<p>

Perhaps you do not have first hand experience with the heart break of a
HOPELESS alcoholic, and I hope that you don't. But if you should,
perhaps you may see for yourself the difference between heavy drinkers
and alcoholics of the HOPELESS variety.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The &quot;hopeless alcoholic&quot; term is a word game.
It's the &quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html##real_Scotsman">Real Scotsman Fallacy</a>&quot;.
Any alcoholic who is killing himself with alcohol is in very bad shape, and
about half of them will eventually die from drink.
Now whether any individual alcoholic is &quot;hopeless&quot; is guesswork.
Flip a coin. Will this one die or get his act together?
<p>
As far as my experience goes, my doctor called me a &quot;late-stage&quot; alcoholic, and said
that it was very close to the end.
He said that the death rate for late-stage alcoholics was the same as for cancer &#8212; fifty percent.
Is that &quot;hopeless&quot; enough for you?
</font>
<p>

When a person has failed at EVERY OTHER attempt, they usually end up
back in a meeting with a big book in thier hand, and AA is reserved for
these desperately lost causes and HOPELESS cases. No one else need
apply, and dare I say they are not saught.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is just more word games. And it is totally untrue. After several failed attempts
to break the bad habit of drinking too much alcohol, half of the alcoholics just quit.
And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">the Harvard Medical School reported</a>
that 80% of the successful quitters did
it alone, without any &quot;treatment&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.
They just get sick and tired of being sick and tired, and change their behavior.
</font>
<p>

The only requirement for membership may be the desire to stop drinking,
but that does not mean that AA is the right place for each person with
that desire. For those for whom it is, they seem to find their way
there... even if over the course of years or decades spent in pursuit
and research of other methods. For if any of these other methods has
actually worked, they would not find themselves back in the rooms of AA
(or hospitals, or jails).

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is bad logic. That is like saying that if you tried to ride a bicycle and
fell down, that your methods are invalid and you must go join a bike-riding
cult to learn how to do it right.
<p>
The whole rap about
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;the course of years or decades spent in pursuit
and research of other methods&quot;</i></font>
is a gross distortion of reality, and simply not true.
Alcoholics spend lots of years drinking and having fun, not years investigating
ways to quit drinking. They drink until they get so sick that they crash
and burn and end up in the hospital or detox center, where an A.A. cult recruiter
starts delivering the same rap as you are parrotting here.
<p>
Now I'm sure that you have many people who will say that they tried to quit
several times and never succeeded before Alcoholics Anonymous.
But that is actually a pretty meaningless statement. Just because somebody
says, while suffering from a morning hangover, that he wants to quit drinking, doesn't
mean that he really wants to quit drinking. And when he goes back to drinking
the next day, it doesn't mean that he is powerless over alcohol. It just means
that he is unclear on his real intentions. He desires to drink, but wishes
that it wasn't so painful the morning after.

</font>
<p>

I think the best thing about your site is that it shows that AA if
diluted by casual drinkers, or those with a less than HOPELESS CONDITION
may be temped to use AA for other self serving means. This can lead to a
rise in the general populaton of the group, but it dilutes the message
and it's effectiveness. What's worse is that it leads to supporting the
egocentric dogmatism that your site reports. This is not AA, but rather
self will run riot under the guise of recovery. None the less, some are
sicker than others, and all are embraced if they should so choose to
participate.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but that whole &quot;real A.A.&quot; or &quot;pure A.A.&quot;
or &quot;back to the basics&quot; rap is a lie and a hoax.
There never was an honest pure spiritual Alcoholics Anonymous.
There was never an A.A. golden age.
A.A. was always a deceptive cult religion headed by a lying thieving
philandering founder named Bill Wilson.
<p>
And A.A. has always practiced coercive recruiting to get more unwilling
victims into the rooms. Heck, even Bill Wilson's sponsor into the Oxford
Group,
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher">Ebby Thacher</a>,
was coerced into the O.G. as an alternative to
six months in jail for habitual drunkenness. Rowland Hazard promised Judge
Graves that he would take Ebby to New York City and give him &quot;the religious cure&quot;.
When Bill Wilson stole &quot;The Alcoholic Squadron&quot; of the Oxford Group, he just
continued the usual coercive recruiting practices. So to complain that &quot;the
real A.A.&quot; is being diluted by the court-ordered victims and other unsuitable people
is both inaccurate
and disingenuous.
<p>
Lastly, the court-ordered people do not &quot;dilute the effectiveness&quot; of Alcoholics
Anonymous.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">There is no effectiveness
and there never was any</a>.
Bill Wilson said so, loud and clear (when he wasn't lying about the A.A. success rate):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to

</blockquote>
<p>
All that Alcoholics Anonymous has ever done is recruit some of the people who are
going to quit drinking anyway, and then fool them into believing that they quit drinking
<i>*because of*</i> Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

differs from the unsuccessful one only in being lucky about

</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, quoted in <i>'PASS IT ON',
The story of Bill Wilson and how the A.A. message reached
the world</i>, page 252.
</font>
</blockquote>

</font>
<p>

The truth is however, that any AA who is actually practicing the program
as outlined in our book could have no objection to your musings, as your
writings address misguided interpetations, but not the program itself.
Over zealous and misinformed people probably populate any group. We are
all human after all.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a bunch of bull. You are just trying to minimize and deny the obvious
faults of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
&quot;The Program&quot; as A.A. believers like to call it, is a collection of cult practices
that
<a href="orange-rroot060.html">Bill Wilson took from the Oxford Group</a>.
&quot;The Program&quot; is worse than useless.
&quot;The Program&quot; is inherently evil and harmful.
<p>
I most assuredly object to the program that is &quot;outlined&quot; in the <i>Big Book</i>.
You could start with the web pages about chapters 4 and 7,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">the &quot;We Agnostics&quot; religious bigotry</a>,
and
<a href="orange-recruit.html">the deceptive recruiting manual</a>.
<p>
Bill Wilson's treatment of women in
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">the &quot;To Wives&quot;</a> and
&quot;The Family Afterwards&quot; chapters is pretty bad, too.
<p>
And
<a href="orange-interpreted.html">the 12 Steps themselves</a> &#8212; the
core of the A.A. program &#8212;
are just Frank Buchman's cult practices for brainwashing new recruits.
There is nothing good or spiritual about them.

<p>
There is no wonderful perfect program that Bill Wilson got straight from God,
which has merely been misinterpreted by some newcomers.
That is just another standard A.A. attempt to explain away the inexcusable behavior of
Alcoholics Anonymous, and the obvious flaws of &quot;The Program&quot;.
</font>
<p>

I hope that any AA's that read your site do not engage in any
controversy but rather use it as a beacon of how or what not to do. I am
never surpised when someone suffers a relapse, we count days in AA, and
we try to add up some good ones from a previous state of HOPELESSNESS.
Not all problem drinkers are HOPELESS, not all need AA, but for those
for whom all else has failed, all we offer is the a DAILY REPREIVE, from
a HOPELESS condition. We do not promise any sustained recovery without
the daily practice of spiritual principles and group support. We really
do, do it, one day at a time. It is the paradox of long term sobriety.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It will be hard for good A.A. members to not practice the evil instructions that
Bill Wilson put in the <i>Big Book</i>, like
<a href="orange-recruit.html">deceptive recruiting</a>
and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html">bait-and-switch recruiting</a> and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html">religious bigotry</a>.
<p>
If a good A.A. member rejects the <i>Big Book</i> and Bill Wilson, what is there left
for him to practice?
</font>
<p>

That any of these people are able to rebuild damaged lives is a miracle
in itself, but as your site states correctly, only for those for whom
all else has been lost and have become as willing as only the dying can
be, to transform their lives through the use of time proven spiritual
tools. C. G. Jung can probably be credited with more of AA's core
philosophy than Bill W., Bill just took the credit.... google the
coorespondance between the men.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry, but none of that is true. I never said that only
<a href="orange-recruit.html#hopeless1">the hopeless, lost, people</a>
can recover. That is
<a href="orange-not_good.html#hit_bottom">standard Bill Wilson propaganda</a>,
not anything that I wrote.
<p>
I have been saying all along that all kinds of people can and do recover.
People quit drinking at all stages of addiction, and some people recover by
just tapering off into moderate controlled drinking, rather than by total abstinence.
It depends on the individual, what the answer is.
<p>
And there are no &quot;time-proven spiritual tools&quot; in Alcoholics
Anonymous, just disproven cult practices.
You are just trying to claim that A.A. has some special magic answer.
That's an example of the standard cult characteristics of
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma"><i>Sacred Science</i></a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_panacea">We Have The Panacea</a>.

<p>
It is good when people quit drinking and rebuild their lives, but it is not
a miracle. A miracle is when someone uses supernatural powers to break the
laws of physics and change the world in impossible ways.
Changing water into wine is a miracle. Healing the blind and lame with just a touch is a miracle.
Raising somebody from
the dead is a miracle. Quitting drinking is merely a very good thing.
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung">Carl Jung had no input whatsoever</a>
into the theology or practices of Alcoholics Anonymous.
None whatsoever.
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">That whole Rowland Hazard and Carl Jung story</a>
was just another one of Bill Wilson's lies, a tall tale that he spread around to hide the
fact that the real source of A.A. ideas, practices, and theology was
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Frank Buchman's fascistic Oxford Group cult</a>.
<p>
I agree that Bill Wilson stole the credit for everything. Absolutely everything about
A.A. that is any good came from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#temperance_unions">earlier
temperance unions and sobriety movements</a>.
</font>
<p>

Speaking of Bill W., one of the things I love about AA, is that he was
not a saint &#8212; and I personally know of no one who thinks he was. He was
a broken down, failed, drunk, raving lunatic... flawed to the core, and
that's why we love him. As one broken down HOPLESS alcoholic to another,
we understand with an intimacy that no one else can. We can relate to
tragedy as comedy and match calamity with serenity.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are engaging in stereotypical minimization and denial. You love a
heartless abusive exploitative criminal
because he was such a heartless abusive exploitative criminal?
What kind of a warped value system is that?
<p>
You are also trying to pull a switcheroo there: You suddenly jump from
rationalizing your worship of Bill Wilson to bragging about some special unique
understanding and intimacy that other people don't have.
I agree that it takes one to know one &#8212; that ex-drinkers and ex-addicts have
a greater understanding of what it feels like to be addicted and sick and down and out.
But A.A. has no monopoly on such understanding.
A.A. members have no greater empathy or ability to relate to alcoholics than do
any other non-A.A. recovered alcoholics or ex-addicts.
The practice of Wilsonism does not give ex-drinkers any special powers or abilities
that ordinary people do not have. That is an example of the cult characteristic
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special"><i>The cult and its members are special</i></a>.

</font>
<p>

I am always in favor that people should truly, truly find and accept for
themselves if they are an alcoholic of the HOPELESS variety, or if there
is an easier softer treatment to which they may alternately benefit.
Niether the problem drinker, nor AA as a group benefit from anyone who
could recover via other means.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, word games. &quot;The HOPELESS variety&quot;.
The only truly hopeless alcoholics are the ones who are already dead.
<p>
And you are again trying to claim that the A.A. members are somehow special, different
from the &quot;non-hopeless&quot; alcoholics. You are also trying to imply that the problem
with A.A. is just that the wrong kind of alcoholics come to the A.A meetings.
That isn't true at all. The problem is with old Alcoholics Anonymous, not with
the newcomers.
(That attempt to blame the newcomers for A.A.'s problems
is an example of &quot;Off-loading Blame&quot;,
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#wife_cause">something that Bill Wilson was very good at</a>.)

<p>
And even that rap about <i>&quot;an easier softer treatment&quot;</i>
displays the arrogance and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#sarcasm">condescension</a>
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
As if the &quot;rigorous honesty&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous
(<i>&quot;Fake It 'Till You Make It&quot;</i>, <i>&quot;Act As If&quot;</i>)
is harder, more manly, more gutsy, more spiritual,
than other methods that are not cult-religion-based.

</font>
<p>

I for one am not alarmed by scientific advances, or alternative
treatments for alcoholism. When I became truly HOPLESS, when all else
had failed, when all hope was gone, there was AA... Like all who
ultimately choose to walk a spiritual path (or attempt to do so), I
think I'd rather be happy than &quot;right&quot; for the rest of my days.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is just more of those word games.
If you want to walk a spiritual path, learn to speak only the truth.
Do not parrot the teachings of a fraud.
<p>
The line about
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
'I'd rather be happy than &quot;right&quot; for the rest of my days'</i></font>
is just another thought-stopping cultish slogan.
Are you trying to imply that it is okay to be wrong, and not tell the truth,
if it makes you happy?
That isn't very spiritual; that's just selfish.
<p>
I'd rather be both right and happy, and I believe that is possible.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Alan,
<p>
I don't know of the specific article that you are talking about, and you didn't
give a time frame. It may be listed
in the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature. I will have to check. That sounds
interesting.
Unfortunately, the computerized indices do not go back very far, so for anything before
around 1990, with most publications you still have to do a manual search.

<p>
It is quite possible that the article you seek came out in response to
this blockbuster report from the Rand Corporation in 1976:<br>

<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="_blank">
<i>Alcoholism and Treatment, Rand Corporation Report R-1739-NIAAA</i></a>
by Dr. J. Michael Polich, Dr. David J. Armor, Harriet B. Braiker, Ph.D.<br>
Prepared for the National Institute On Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, June 1976.<br>
Also published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1978.<br>
LC: AS36.R3 R-1739<br>

<p>
In that study, the doctors found that half of all recovered alcoholics &#8212; that is,
alcoholics who stopped self-destructive drinking &#8212; did it by tapering off into
moderate controlled drinking. The other half did it by total abstinence.
<p>
The A.A. true believers exploded and screamed that such a report gave alcoholics
an excuse to drink, and would kill alcoholics. Even Ann Landers got into the act
in denouncing the report.
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Rand_1739" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
<p>
The article that you are seeking may well have came out during that furor.
<p>
I have to throw in my own comments on that subject. It is a matter of the make-up
of the individual whether any given alcoholic can recover into moderate controlled
drinking.
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#SOS">Dr. Kenneth Blum</a>,
who discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcoholism, and perhaps also to a
tendency towards drug addiction, declared that genetic alcoholics must
totally abstain from drinking,
while other kinds of alcoholics may learn to drink moderately.

<p>
Personally, I am a genetic alcoholic. I cannot drink moderately. I know, I tried, plenty,
and it just doesn't work. Just a few beers and I will be readdicted again.
But I can quite happily and easily totally abstain from drinking alcohol,
so that is what I am doing.

<p>
Different strokes for different folks. Your mileage may vary, etc...

<p>

Hello Monica,
<p>
Please quit trying to put words into my mouth. Please practice some of that
&quot;rigorous honesty&quot; that Bill Wilson liked to brag about (<i>Big Book</i>, page 58).
<p>
I never said that there was
<font color="#4f007f"><i>

You are also practicing
<a href="orange-cult-sos.html#projection">psychological projection</a>
&#8212; accusing others of doing what you are doing.
<p>
I do recall having used the &quot;wrong&quot; term when I said that it was wrong to lie to
sick people about what might heal them. It is very wrong and very immoral to foist
completely ineffective quack medicine on sick people and tell them that
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;It works great. Millions cured. RARELY HAVE we seen it fail.&quot;</i></font><br>
Now that is the wrong way &#8212; the wrong way to heal people, the wrong way
to recruit for your favorite religion, the wrong way to live.

<p>
When you ask,
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Isn't it important that they believe in something that helps them live
then die?&quot;</i></font>,
you are grossly distorting the picture.
<p>
<ol>
<li>
Belief in A.A. does not help people to live or to overcome a drinking problem.<br>
<p><li>
Belief in &quot;Higher Power&quot;, or Santa Claus, or Genie, or whatever
it is that grants wishes in the heretical A.A. theology,
does not help people to quit drinking.
<p> <li>
What Professor and Doctor George E. Vaillant,
who is a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc., discovered
from 20 years of enthusiastically shoving A.A. on alcoholics, was that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. was completely ineffective</a>
and didn't help alcoholics at all. It just raised the death rate.<br>
After 8 years of A.A.-based &quot;treatment&quot;, Vaillant's first 100 patients scored:
5 sober, 29 dead, 66 still drinking. But 5% per year is also the normal rate of spontaneous
remission in alcoholics, so the number of alcoholics who quit drinking in the A.A.
program is the same number as who quit without any such help. A.A. was completely
ineffective and didn't help the alcoholics at all, belief or no belief.
</ol>

<p>
Besides which, what's with the &quot;belief&quot; thing? Since when are wrong beliefs
so wonderful?<br>
<ul>
<p><li>
Is it better if people believe that the world is flat, diseases are caused
by nasty witches casting spells and hexes,
and toads cause warts?<br>
<p><li>
Is it better if people happily believe that alcoholism is a spiritual disease that
can only be cured (or not cured, but delayed) by practice of cult religion?
<p><li>
Is it better if people are taught that they are powerless over alcohol, and can't
quit drinking by using their own intelligence and will power?
</ul>

<p>
Now this is a free country. You have a God-given and Constitutional right to join any
religion you wish. You can go find great &quot;happiness&quot; in the Moonies or Hari Krishnas
or People's Temple or Heaven's Gate or Scientology, if that's how you like to get your
kicks.<br>
Heck, you can even join Alcoholics Anonymous if you are so in love with cult religion.<br>
But please don't make unrealistic claims that belief in a cult religion
helps alcoholics to quit drinking. It doesn't.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed reading your articles really. I
haven't laughed so much in ages, not to mention the fact that I actually
feel like I am regaining my sanity after 7 years of NA and AA! i have
been absolutely glued to them ever since i found them, you make so much
sense and in a very simple and easy to understand way! Where has my head
been at' please do not answer that!

<p>

You're a star for taking all the time and effort to put those pieces
together and put them on the internet. On a more serious note I really
started to worry and with good cause about the state of my mental health
so, for what its worth you have really helped one person make the
journey of regaining their dignity integrity and ability to function as
a rational healthy human being.

<p>

Take care and I can't thank you enough

Oh, by the way, when you question yourself for believing in the A.A. rap for so
long, don't be too hard on yourself. Remember that you were up against some
world-class cultists. Cults are subject to the same laws of nature as everything
else &#8212; survival of the fittest. The stupidest cults are still-born.
The mediocre cults die out. Only the very best,
slickest, most cleverly deceptive cults survive and become long-lasting world-wide
organizations. So you were fooled by the best of the best deceivers.
And they got into your head when you were the most vulnerable
&#8212; sick, weak, detoxing, recovering from alcohol poisoning,
and very confused and cloudy-headed. It was never a fair contest.

<p>

I'm not one to write letters to strangers over the internet, but I'm
doing it anyway. I found your site the day after leaving a
dual-diagnosis treatment facility. I was looking for the means to
articulate why I left the treatment facility early to some friends of
mine who are in N.A., and I found more than enough. Thanks for writing
this. I believe twelve-step programs do more harm than good, and
institutionalized A.A. is a waste of time, money and energy that does
nothing to alleviate the suffering of drug addicts and alcoholics. My
friends in recovery are well-intentioned, good-hearted people who are
concerned for my well-being, for sure, and I appreciate their
proselytizing for what it is: an effort to see me succeed in taking on
my drinking problem. But they're misguided. Anyway, please keep the site
up, or give me an opportunity to download the whole thing if you ever
take it down. I'd like to have it handy as a resource if I ever need to
explain to health care professionals or social workers why I don't
believe in treatment.

You can easily download the whole web site by getting the archive files.

And you can easily burn the whole web site into a CD.

It works off of a CD just as well as on the Internet.

UPDATE: 2012.12.15: Actually, the Orange Papers has grown so large that it won't fit on

<p>

Yo Orange!

<p>

This is my third letter, I think.  I feel compelled to write.  I was
stuck in that place for two years &#8212; and what creeps me out is that at
the time, I /agreed with nearly all of it/.  What scares me is how I
agreed with it, how it made so much crystal clear sense &#8212; I was blank
faced goggled eyed for most of those two years, desperately slaving
toward serenity, losing all perspective.  It was like being under a
thick warm blanket, very comforting, but in the end I was being
suffocated.  I know politics should not come into this, but I have
always been left leaning, libertarian if you like &#8212; thats the way I
choose to interpret reality, and others.  I have always believed in
reason and human feeling...

<p>

...but when I was in those rooms that slowly was being picked apart,
dismantled.  The more I saw that &quot;every problem was my own making&quot; the
more I lacked compassion and compulsion to help others in need.  Is that
warped?  I can't describe to you the affect that place had on the way I
saw myself and others &#8212; and I bought it!  So the process of recoverying
from sadistic mind control is to re-establish my own TRUTH in everything
from politics (too afraid to as I was sick), relationships (if they like
me, they are sick!), hobbies (thats isolating because I am sick) ad
infinum.  Not only am I recovering from the affects of *DRINKING TOO MUCH
ALCOHOL* but I am also regaining my own autonomy, I am basically slowly
starting to believe in myself, this after 3 years of sobriety.

<p>

Liberty! Freedom! Choices!

<p>

Orange, it started with this damn site.  Its so powerful, so true, and
is a /good/ thing. Rambel over.  This site is starting to mean a great
deal to a great deal of people who have felt trapped and terrified by
spiritual lunacy. Thank you,

From:  	&quot;Ramos C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Greetings and Thanks<br>

<p>

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>

I haven't seen much of your site (yet!) but my wife visits all the
time. I just DL'd and extracted your zipped book for her to enjoy on the
new system my brother and I recently built (about our 8th), which
unfortunately runs windoze (just had to mention that, I love your
terminology)... but then, I used to be an applesloth fan (until those
barstids sold out; typical) &#8212; (sorry about all the parenthesis... you'll
get used to it, I hope... I'm just full of asides...).

<p>

Seriously, you seem an intelligent and caring person, and your site
helped my wife with AA. /I/ know a cult when I see one. I myself come
from an alcoholic family, but I only have about 6 drinks a year, usually
at the holidaze.

<p>

She says you were a hippie in the past, tried lotsa drugs, and found
alcohol and tobacco (the only drugs sanctioned and supported by our
government, and in my book the worst of the lot) the worst to give up.
I've done a few thingies (speed, acid, coke, etc.) myself, and found
only tobacco to be a problem to quit (I did quit for 3 months last year,
after having to goto hospital to dry out from Oxycontin and Roxicodone
which I took for 7 years due to a bunch of back injuries caused by being
rear-ended while stopped in traffic, but that's another story which I
can relate if you're interested).

<p>

Even though all the doctors at the hospital judged me a drug abuser
and wouldn't believe I was quitting on my own at home (with the
blessings and supervision of my PCP, who prescribed when I was suicidal
and nobody else would), that I had already quit the Oxy a month
previously and didn't have any problem (other than a few withdrawal
symptoms I dealt with quite nicely at home) until 'THEM' busted my
doctor and I suddenly ran out of Roxies before I could wean myself off,
even though I _never_ _/once/_ asked them for any opioid pain
medications... or any meds, for that matter (I still was taking
Ibuprofen and Carisoprodol), even despite all that, after a couple days
of being really sick I never, during or after, wanted any opioids from
them, despite all that, I never had the urge to obtain or do any more
opioids. There just wasn't a problem. I've never had a problem with any
drugs when it came to stopping... except tobacco. Just very lucky, I
guess. After being asked to go through monthly urine tests and sign a
'narcotics agreement' by a doctor at a clinic I had to goto to renew my
heart meds and carisoprodol prescriptions, I said &quot;fudge this!&quot; and
weaned off the soma as well. Fortunately, no problem (I now use Valerian
Root as a muscle relaxer... better than naught). Haven't seen that
doctor since.

<p>

Now, I understand the doctor's point of view. after treating many
people who've brought serious problems on themselves by abusing, I _can_
understand their feelings. But like with AA, one ends up being judged
and lumped into the accepted perception of a 'drug user'. The only drug
I use besides tobacco is the wacky weed, and not very often, because I
have to wait until someone invites me to join them in a puff or two, or
is kind enough to make a small gift to me. Mostly, I use it for pain,
and I have a *lot* of pain. 24/7/52, for the rest of my life. Yeah, that
accident really left me f***ed-up. Plus other things, like a crushed
hand. So I don't get much pain relief.

<p>

But those seven years using opioids helped me, and I don't regret it
one bit; and my doctor, in my book, was and is a brave saint. It helped
me to do what a score of doctors at several pain centers told me was my
only option: /learn to live with it /(of course, they never offered
advice on /how/ to do this). Well, I did learn to live with it. And deal
with the horrible depression from having my life ruined forever because
some clown wasn't paying attention to his driving; and having a great
credit history (12 credit cards) ruined because I can't work (I've
tried... again and again). And the panic attacks from all these
creditors calling me up for their money (some still are calling, and
it's been 12 years).

<p>

My wife was PO'd when I came home and told her I was quitting the
pain meds... I just decided on my own, because I knew it was time; they
no longer worked, I was taking enough to kill you and several other
people (420mg a day) and THEM were harassing my doctor. She was
convinced I would become a monster. Well, I've had a few bitchy days,
but she says I'm doing really well. Myself, I don't see what the big
deal is. There are many, many people even worse off them me. I just
never had any kind of addiction problem (except ciggies), and have found
that, as Reader's Digest says, laughter is the best medicine (along with
my wife's and my rescued greyhound's love).

<p>

So, I have a lot of compassion for people who do have alcohol/drug
problems, and wish them all the best of luck. But AA ain't gonna do it.
Only you can prevent forest fires. Only you can quit alcohol/drugs. Only
you can beat or manage depression. You understand  I mean the general
'you'. A little help from your friends, or 'professionals', can help of
course. But I've gone with people to AA meetings. I saw no friends or
professionals. Just a lot of sad souls who were effectively brainwashed,
spouting the same old pre-prepared rhetoric, and still weren't any better.

<p>

Far out. I haven't whined so much about all this to anyone before.
I guess you've impressed me. My poor wife still struggles with booze.
She did before we met, and thought AA helped, but only because she had
no-one else. She does now, but is trying to find other programs, because
AA did more harm than good. She is certainly impressed, and finds your
site very helpful. So thanks again for all your efforts, and for putting
up with my outrageous rantings.

<p>

Please keep up the good work, and good it is. I just hope the
unfortunate souls out there can someday see the light, and I refer to
all believers in AA. Thanks once again. Especially for your patience,
which I'm sure you're about out of (excuse the bad grammar).

<p>

Muta

<p>

PS &#8212; Wifey sez you might use this... I don't believe it, it's just to
long, but it's yours to do with as you see fit.

Hi,

<p>

I was reading some of your information posted on your website, it is
interesting.

<p>

I am curious as to why you are so against AA, even if it has helped only a
small percentage of people, isn't that better than nothing?

<p>

Doug

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Doug,
<p>
Thanks for the question. The answer is that A.A. harms a lot of people,
probably far more than it &quot;helps&quot;. The evidence that A.A. helps
anybody is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">so thin that it is non-existent</a>.
<p>
A.A. spreads grossly false information about alcoholism and recovery,
and suppresses research into methods of recovery that might work better than
Alcoholics Anonymous.
See
<a href="orange-aalies.html">The Twelve Biggest Lies of A.A.</a> for some of
the details.
<p>

A.A. even drives some people crazy, and pushes them over the edge into suicide.

Somebody had better tell the truth about all of that. I seem to have gotten stuck

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I work as a facilitator in an intensive outpatient treatment program.
We work from a disease model of addiction, but the backbone of the
program remains the 12 steps.  I am looking for other ways of really
helping people who struggle with this.  I would be genuinely interested
in any reference to information that has helped you or people you know.
I liked your one step program &#8212; &quot;Just don't drink any more alcohol.&quot;

<p>

Sincerely,<br> 
Lisa H.

<p>
<font color="blue">

Hi Lisa,
<p>
Thanks for the question.
<p>
What has been most helpful to me is:
<p>
<ol>
<li> The decision to really quit and stay quit. That is simple but powerful.
When other guys in &quot;the program&quot; were mumbling things like,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I wonder which of us will be the one to make it?&quot;</font>,<br>
I was saying to myself,
<font color="green">
&quot;I know that I'm going to make it,
because I've had it with being sick and dying.&quot;
</font>
It wasn't a question.

<p>
This one is very tricky.
Lots of people will say that they want to quit drinking or drugging or smoking,
but they don't, not really. They just want the pain to stop. They still want the
feeling of using their favorite drug, but without the pain that comes from
chronic use of that drug. As long as they
continue to believe that they can get one side of the coin without the other &#8212;
the pleasure without the pain &#8212; they are likely to relapse.
<p>
<li>
One thing that is helpful in getting people's thinking clearer is the techniques
for logical thinking
that SMART teaches, like a cost/benefit analysis. (Which Albert Ellis calls a
&quot;risk/reward ratio&quot;.)
Look <a href="orange-letters8.html#cost_benefit">here</a> for one example of that.

<p>
When you strip a cost/benefit analysis down to it's simplest form, it can be something
like,
<font color="green">
&quot;If I go out drinking tonight, it might be a whole lot of fun tonight, but
I know that I will also smoke a cigarette
once I get good and drunk. Once drunk, I won't be able to resist a
cigarette. I know that because I never
did before. Then I would get instantly readdicted to tobacco and be
trapped in that Hell again, and that's no fun. It took me 30 years to get unhooked
from that. I don't want to go there again.
So I won't go out drinking tonight. That's the easiest and safest answer.&quot;

<p>
See? You just weigh the benefits against the costs, the positives against the negatives,
the pleasure against the pain, and ask yourself what you really want.
<p>
When I weigh the fun of drinking against the pain of coughing myself
to death it's an easy choice.
<p>
And then I think about the pain of waking up sick as a dog with hangovers,
a zillion times, year after year, and that really does it.

That brings up the subject of SMART meetings (classes) in general. I recommend them.
The truth is that I quit drinking without them, and didn't even know that SMART existed until
after I had about 3 months of sobriety. Still, SMART was like a breath of fresh air,
a real revelation after all of the A.A. meetings I had been to.
They tell the truth and they don't try to cram crazy cult dogma down your throat.
I didn't go to many more A.A. or N.A. meetings after I found out about SMART.

Understanding the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a> is a
very big thing for me.
<p>
It seems to me like recovering from an addiction happens in two distinct phases:
<ol>
<li>
In phase one, you just fight to get unaddicted, to go through the pain
and discomfort and disorientation of withdrawal, and to get out
of the habit and lifestyle of routine consumption of something addicting.
<li>
In phase two, the mind games start. That little voice in your head starts whispering,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Oh, it's been so long since we've had one. We've got a handle on it now. We've got
it under control. Just one will be okay now.&quot;<br>
</font>
If you believe that addictive voice for a minute you are screwed.
</ol>
<p>
Understanding that, and not getting fooled again, is extremely important for staying
clean and sober over the long haul. I would harp on that technique a lot.
</ol>

<p>
We have discussed the whole question of what alternatives work many times in
the letters section. Look at these letters:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters.html#alternative">alternatives</a>

<li> 
<a href="orange-letters15.html#cost_benefit2">another cost-benefit analysis</a>,
about quitting A.A.

Have a good day, and good luck with your work.

From:  	&quot;Peter F.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Bill Wilson's infidelities<br>

<p>

Hi,

<p>

I am an active member of AA and loved the article on Bill Wilson's
extra-marital affairs; having a strong interest in AA history. What it
undeniably proves to me that the AA program works despite the individual
member including the founder. Personally, I do not revere Bill although I
thank him every day for the fellowship because I would be probably dead by
now if it had not been founded.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I think what you meant to say in that last sentence is
that you would be dead if you had not stopped drinking alcohol.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">The A.A. program does not work</a>.

It has a zero percent success rate above the normal rate of
spontaneous remission. A.A. indoctrination even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">increases the
rate of binge drinking</a> in alcoholics.
</font>
<p>

There is no rationalisation or excuses for Bill's behaviour and is
particularly reprehensible with regard to the unknown damage caused to the
alcoholic victims. It just demonstrates how flawed he was therefore it was
just as well that the AA principles were gleaned from much older and trusted
sources rather than from Bill's own philosophy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but there are no &quot;spiritual principles&quot; in
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">the cult practices of
Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>. And the pro-Nazi Oxford Group sure
wasn't &quot;much older and trusted sources&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.
</blockquote>

</font>
<p>

I do not see that AA has developed into a personality cult &#8212; it has survived
and flourished after his death. To be sure there are  the pro and con camps
but I see this as froth and bubble and totally superfluous to AA's purpose.
Let those who get a charge from it indulge. Even the alteration and
reinterpretation of AA history is irrelevant. Most members are lucky to know
who Bill or Dr. Bob were let alone their shenanigans in AA.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, regardless of what you don't see, of course A.A.
is a personality cult. I've heard far too many A.A. members raving
about how it was a miracle that Bill Wilson invented 12 such perfect steps that they
would solve all of the problems of the world, and how Bill was
<a href="orange-letters34.html#messenger">a messenger from God</a>.
</font>
<p>

Notwithstanding your article is most valuable because of the perspective on
the origins of AA and reminds us all of the humility required for spiritual
progress, &quot;not spiritual perfection&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well whatever, thanks.
</font>
<p>

Regards and thanks<br>
Peter F.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay Peter,
<p>
You have a good day too.
