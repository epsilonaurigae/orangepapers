From:  	AnythingbutAA<br>
Subject:<br>

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
Thanks for answering my last e-mail. Really glad I could contribute that phrase
(better off pretending you're an alcoholic in here, than out there pretending you're
not). I'm writing again to you so soon because I've let them (the AAs,
steppers-whatever) get under my skin and I'm a bit upset about it.

<p>
A couple of days after having written to you I bumped in to someone else I used to
see at AA. Apart from being a bit superior on the AA stuff he always seemed a nice
guy. He could speak on a range of subjects and seemed genuinely interested in other
people. He is also about my age (44) and we had a relatively similar upbringing. So
initially I was quite glad to see him. After a few pleasantries, inevitably, he
asked if I was drinking. Being none of his business I lied and said no. By the way,
I don't drink anything like I used to and to drink to the point of inebriation, let
alone blackout, just doesn't seem to happen any more.

<p>
As I said to you in my last letter I haven't been to a meeting in over a year. He
asked me to go to one with him which I said I'd think about and left it at that. I
didn't go to the one he suggested. I just couldn't face it. About two days' later I
got a text message that said he was going to a meeting and felt &quot;wonky&quot; &#8212; could he
meet me there half an hour before the meeting so we could have a chat? To be
honest, I'm not the greatest socialiser in the world and do get a bit lonely so I
thought I'd go just for some company. Besides, I've done a lot of reading up on
your site as well as some others (some great cartoons on Youtube, eh?) and thought
I was pretty much invulnerable to any nonsense.

<p>
When I got there half an hour before the meeting was due to start he wasn't there.
I decided to wait outside as it was a beautiful day. I was standing out there
alongside the &quot;greeter&quot; who seemed happy and pleasant enough, albeit in a
mechanical, almost robotic, kind of way. He was making pleasant, inconsequential
conversation, to which I was happy to respond. Then I asked how long he'd &quot;been
in&quot;. He looked at me, his whole persona menacingly transformed, as though I'd just
asked if I could sleep with his mother for money or something. It was very odd and
unnerved me. Then with his mouth twisted with rage he asked me why that was &quot;so
important?!!&quot;.

<p>
I summoned the courage to tell him I wasn't really interested and that I was only
making conversation, as assertively as I could. Again in an instant his persona
changed back and he told me eight years and enquired how long it was for me.
Wierdo!

<p>
Fortunately, or so I thought, twenty minutes late my &quot;friend&quot; arrived so I turned
to him and ignored the wierdo and said hello. The wierdo interjected to say hello
very aggressively. The chemistry between them was such that I knew in an instant
not to share anything of what had just happened. The conversation then at my
&quot;friend's&quot; instigation turned to bankers and how he'd like to create a
concentration camp for them all. Ah, some sanity! Agreeing with him in a jocular
fashion I added a couple of my targets too; such as estate agents (I'm trying to
sell my house at the moment) and tabloid journalists (I'm sure you've seen the news
on the newspapers here hacking in to the phone of a murdered teenager). He then
said to me;

<p>
&quot;What are we going to do with you? You have so many resentments. Why hate?&quot;

<p>
I just thought... well it begins witha c. He hadn't even told me why he was so
&quot;wonky&quot;. I began to think that he wasn't &quot;wonky&quot; at all and that he'd used the
incident bumping into each other as some sort of 12 step opportunity.
Inexplicably, I followed him in to the actual meeting. Immediately, I was faced
with a woman whose advances I'd rejected in the past. I thought I'd just say hello
and she looked me up and down and then blanked me. This was turning in to a
nightmare. Excrutiating!

<p>
I took my seat and the guy who'd invited me didn't even sit next to me, preferring
the company of the wierdo of all people. The meeting was delayed as the &quot;chair&quot;
didn't turn up. I speculated out loud that he was probably on the piss. Yet another
mistake. The deafening and hostile silence made me sweat with both fear and anger.
What was I doing there? Somehow, I just felt too awkward to leave though. Horrible!

<p>
Anyway, someone at the meeting volunteered to do the &quot;chair&quot;, saying how &quot;honoured&quot;
she was to be asked. Step 11. Oh no! She then launched in to a bitter, hateful rant
about her neighbours, her father, and everything else wrong with her life. She then
added right at the end at least &quot;God&quot; had got her through it. The secretary did
much the same thing and then opened up for &quot;sharing&quot;. The first one was just
bitching about her washing machine! The second one was just horrible. He told how
he'd been in for 21 years (you get less for murder here) and started to cry
uncontrollably as his mother had just died; that he'd chaired a meeting two weeks
ago and that people had walked out, and that he'd never come so close to suicide. I
don't mean to sound callous, but after 21 years you'd have thought he might have
forged a friendship with someone he could have shared his grief with in dignified
privacy. I'd had enough and got up and left.

<p>
I texted my &quot;friend&quot; and told him about how disturbed I was at what I'd experienced
and seen and that I didn't really want to go any more, but thanks. It was his text
back to me that really annoyed me:

<p>
&quot;I've felt the same way as you. I hated just about everybody when I cane to AA. Now
I just don't care because it works. End of story. Some people say that we hate
others because we really hate ourselves. There will be a time when you run out of
options. Take care&quot;

<p>
So I now hate myself and everybody else because I don't like 12 step &quot;treatment&quot;.
Who does he think he is?

<p>
Sorry to have gone on so long. I feel a bit better now.

<p>
All the best,

<p>
AnythingbutAA

Subject:  	A new thought...<br>

<p>
Actually I COULD have made a mistake in the books publishing dates &#8212; between
&quot;How to quit worrying and start living&quot; and &quot;How to win friends and
influence people&quot;....

<p>
I actually could have fucked that up...

<p>
Simple mistake.

<p>
But if I did &#8212; I am not telling.

<p>
Because the Quit Worrying book and the AA basic text ARE almost
identical.....

<p>
AND I do recall that Carnegie had lecture notes or manuscripts, that were
printed in 1937 &#8212; that he used as the basis for the  book published in
1948...

<p>
Absolutely certain of that...

<p>
But it was a long time ago and much of my recovery resource material has
been buried across time and hard drives etc. The internet evolves with
obscure material vanishing never to be found again &#8212; or it's buried under
10,000,000 more new results in the last 5 years.

<p>
So I might have gotten the two books mixed up...

<p>
But I will just keep that quiet as I don't have the inclination top do lots
of deep searching for Carnegie's manuscripts and using his book as a jumping
off point or a diversion for many others out of and away from AA &#8212; with some
creditable emotional self health material is a good thing.

<p>
It's an excellent read &#8212; and the examples are SANE and practical.

<p>
Hope your well Anon3.

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Anon3,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, I've been following the debate over on the forum, at:<br>

<p>
I agree that there was other stuff that Dale Carnegie published before 1948. Way before.
<p>
The dead give-away, the undeniable evidence, is what JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) said
about Bill Wilson's book <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> when they reviewed it.
On October 14, 1939, the Journal of the American Medical Association
published a review of
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: How More Than One Hundred Men Have
Recovered from Alcoholism&quot;</i>, that declared:
<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The book contains instructions as to how to intrigue the alcoholic addict
into the acceptance of divine guidance in place of alcohol in terms
strongly reminiscent of Dale Carnegie and
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">the adherents of the Buchman
(&quot;Oxford&quot;) movement</a>. The one
valid thing in the book is the recognition of the seriousness of addiction
to alcohol. Other than this, the book has no scientific merit or interest.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#AMA_review" target="_blank">Full text here</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, by 1939, Dale Carnegie had already published enough books or papers that the editors of JAMA immediately
recognized the style of proselytizing.
So it is certainly possible for Bill Wilson to have read and copied stuff from earlier Carnegie publications.

<p>
Personally, I also don't know enough about Dale Carnegie to know what he published back in the 1930s. But I'm
sure that the information is out there somewhere. (Like the <i>X-Files</i> said, &quot;The truth is out there.&quot;)
I'll check
<a href="orange-letters209.html#Worldcat" target="_blank"><i>WorldCat</i></a>
when I get the opportunity. There is a very good chance &#8212;  almost a certainty &#8212; 
that they list all of his books and publications.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Amy Winehouse article by Hazelden Doctor<br>

<p>
Hi Terrance,
<p>
I hope this email finds you well. Well, here we go &#8212; the articles re: the disease
model of drug and alcohol addiction are being rolled out right after Amy Winehouses'
death. This one is by Marvin Seppala MD &#8212; chief medical officer of Hazelden (see
following link:)
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222743/http://www.news4jax.com/health/28673563/detail.html" target="_blank">
http://www.news4jax.com/health/28673563/detail.html</a>

<p>
Now, if I was a cynic I might say to myself that the treatment industry is
exploiting her death in order to say to everyone &quot;See? We told you it was a
disease...!&quot;  the funny thing is we don't even know the exact course of death at
this time. In the weeks and months ahead we will learn more. I hope you're having a
good summer &#8212; talk to you later ~
<p>
Bill

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the link. That is disgusting, isn't it? Those Hazelden salesmen don't miss an opportunity
to sell their quack medicine. They sure were quick to decide that Amy Weinhouse died of &quot;the disease of
addiction&quot;, before the autopsy was even done.
<p>
The evening after I got your letter, I heard on one of the celebrity gossip shows that her tox screen
came back negative &#8212;  that she did not die from a drug or alcohol overdose.
There was conjecture that maybe she died of a seizure.
Somebody commented that she had suffered from seizures before.
They also made some suggestions that she might have had a heart attack. A few comments that
maybe she was in very poor health from a lot of drug and alcohol use, and that might have contributed to
a seizure or a heart attack.
<p>
But now that the tox screen came back negative, watch the Stepper salesmen suddenly
shut up about &quot;her addiction&quot;,
and how her death proves that you should give your money to a treatment center.
Suddenly nobody will have anything more to say.
They will suddenly just forget all about it, as if it never happened.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now. And yes, I'm having a good summer, and I hope you do too.

Read your so-called papers. Funny, seems that AA is killing everyone that
it  comes in contact with yet you can't shut them down ('them' being AA)
because  anyone or group that has any power is out to protect AA hence foiling
your  tireless effort to save the masses of boozehounds that yearn to be free
from  alcohol. Yeah, whatever. What a sorry excuse to validate your warped
sense of  reality.

Hello, TBLight,
<p>
Scientology and the Moonies hurt everyone they come into contact with too,

If you have gone about the way  of attempting to shut down Scientology and
the Moonies as you have done in  regards to shutting down AA then it's very
clear why there's  failure in shutting down Scientology or the Moonies.
People usually don't  respond well to uninformed jackasses such as yourself.
<p>
Who's protecting AA? According to you  Mr Orange the judicial system,
churches, police, pharmacutical companies,  rehabilitation centers, hell, you
even threw the Nazis in there for giggles (I  guess it looks really evil if you
have a bunch of monocle-wearing bald Colonel  Klinks running the show), all
are protecting AA in some elaborate  scheme to keep AA afloat. You have
spent pages upon pages screaming about it.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, the &quot;judicial system&quot; is not &quot;protecting&quot; Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">Misguided judges are illegally sentencing people to the A.A. religion</a>,
 but that is not protecting Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Rehab centers do most assuredly sell the A.A. 12-Step religion as a quack cure for addictions.
<p>
The pharmaceutical industry is not in love with A.A., because A.A. routinely tells sick people not to take medications.
<p>
I did not gratuitously throw Nazis in there.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
A.A. founder Bill Wilson derived all of the A.A. theology</a>

so.&quot; To the best of my  knowledge you do post all your e-mails so I can't say
that you are not letting  other opinions at least be heard (then angerily

No, actually, Steve, you are giving the world a far better example of anger in response to criticism than what I write.

You right that I publish nearly ALL letters that I receive. The only exceptions are when people start off by
asking me not to publish the letter, and a rare few items of hate mail that are just more repetitions
of what the correspondent had already sent in, and that had already been published.
And then there were a few letters from obviously mentally deranged people that I felt were better left unpublished.
But otherwise, I publish everything.

Some things get delayed for a while when I have to do more research, but I try hard to publish everything in
a timely manner.

So what is your problem, Steve? You seem to be in a real bad  mood, and you
haven't said anything about what might help people who suffer from
addictions. You haven't even presented any facts about anything.
<p>
Do you approve of criminals and con artists promoting cult religion and
quack  medicine as a cure for addictions? How about quackery as a cure for
cancer or  tuberculosis or AIDS or coronary disease? Is that okay?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

No problem here, big man. Not in a bad  mood either. And did I say anything
about presenting a cure for an addiction?  Think not. But apparently your
cure is to get a page on the web and pound away  for hours presenting a
so-called 'paper' that 'exposes' AA as the evil monster  it is. All you've done
is give me a good laugh and a quick way to waste 15  minutes by replying to
your response.
<p>
No, I don't approve of criminals or  con artists but what usually happens
when I encounter such individuals/groups is  that I contact the authorities.
But since AA is being protected by law  enforcement and the judicial system
(according to you) I guess that won't work  or you knew that you'd be
laughed right out on your ass if you did report them.  True, there may be some bad
apples in AA but you claim that anyone that has  succeeded in AA is at best
a puppet and more than likely some ghoul that is  waiting to pounce on
anything that crawls into an AA meeting. Your misery is  obvious.
<p>
ps; you wouldn't happen to be Keith Olberman would you?
</font>

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, Steve, I am not Keith Olberman.
<p>
Right, you didn't say anything about what will help alcoholics. So what is your problem? You go non-linear over
somebody criticizing quack medicine and cult religion
that doesn't cure alcoholics, but you have nothing to say about what
will actually help the alcoholics. Why not?
You don't even claim that A.A. works?
So what is your point? Do you just get angry when people criticize quackery and cult religions? Why?

<p>
You have said that you are not a member of Alcoholics Anonymous. So why do you
get so angry when someone criticizes A.A.?
<p>
And why are you incapable of responding in any manner other than
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i></a>?

<p>
Again, you are twisting my words when you claim that I said that
<font color="black">&quot;AA is being protected by law  enforcement and the judicial system.&quot;</font>
I didn't say that.
I said that A.A. is being PROMOTED by some misguided judges and parole officers and wardens.
<p>
However, other judges &#8212; wiser higher-ranking appeals judges &#8212;  have declared
that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">A.A. is just a religion, and that it
is illegal and unConstitutional to force anybody to go to an A.A. meeting</a>.
<p>
But the lower-ranking judges who are in love with A.A. ignore the law and what is right,
and continue to do whatever they want to do anyway.
(Doesn't that sound just like a stereotypical alcoholic? Are those judges really secret drunkards?)

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Re: Your anti-AA doctrine<br>

<p>
Well, I guess I have been lucky because I have met people who led me to
other books like the Four Agreements and other spiritual stuff that help
make me a better person. I also see the Big Book as just a method to be a
better person. It is my own God I create, so I just chose Love to be that
Higher Power. It isn't religious, confessing and so on, just facing reality,
really. Just accepting that I need to change.
<p>
I guess I am also lucky that a doctor has not made it mandatory for me. I
hope you are in good health again after being on the brink of death.
<p>
I guess if you look at AA members, that might explain a lot of the failure.
I don't think most of them choose to go there. I think a lot of people there
use it for other reasons than it was intended too. It is mostly a bad crowd
and the success rate for those people in anything would not likely be high.
<p>
But I recall reading that AA had about a 5% success rate. That sounds about
right. It depends on what you define success as. I think that was long-term
sobriety. But I have seen with my own eyes many people get a year with AA's
help when they never have been able to get a week before. Sure, there are
lots who lie about it too but I think it does help people to go and try it.
If it is not for you, that's OK. Hey, everyone is different. But why condemn
it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Rhonda,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. This line really stood out: &quot;It is my own God I create...&quot;
Wow. Now that <i>is</i> an interesting religion.
Most religions claim that God created us, but in A.A., you create God.
Amazing.  (To then claim that A.A. isn't religious is absurd.)
<p>
But how does a home-made &quot;God&quot; perform miracles for you and save your life,
and take care of your will and your life in Step 3?<br>
Or take away all of your defects in Step 7?<br>
Or talk to you in a s&eacute;ance and give you work orders and the power to carry them out in Step 11?<br>
Or make you quit drinking in Step ???...<br>
(<i>Now where exactly did the 12 Steps tell us to quit drinking?</i>)

<p>
You see, Rhonda,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater" target="_blank">A.A. is pulling a bait-and-switch trick there</a>.
First, your &quot;God&quot; can be anything you wish.
But then your &quot;God&quot; must be the A.A. version of God Who
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand" target="_blank">delivers miracles on demand</a>.

<p>
If you have actually made yourself into a better person by your own efforts,
then my sincere congratulations to you.
There is however no reason to believe that such improvements were caused by the <i>Big Book</i>
or the 12 Steps, or anything in Alcoholics Anonymous. (The <i>Big Book</i> and the 12 Steps
are just
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's copy of Dr. Frank Buchman's fascist cult religion</a>.)
<p>
The fact that you agreed with me that A.A. has at best a 5% success rate proves that.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg" target="_blank">Five percent is the same success rate
as alcoholics get from doing no program and getting no help</a>.
Those alcoholics who go it alone, and quit on their own, get the same
success rate. So Alcoholics Anonymous does not actually cause any improvement at all.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">In fact, A.A. often makes things worse</a>.

<p>
That is why I criticize Alcoholics Anonymous. A.A. is a hoax and a fraud that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">kills more alcoholics than
it saves</a>.
<p>
Then, when the fundamentalist A.A. members tell newcomers not to take their medications, A.A. turns
into a really harmful cult. And then, when the A.A. oldtimers prey on the young girls, A.A. turns into
a criminal organization.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hello again, James,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
<p>
I never mentioned &quot;Drunks for Jesus&quot;; you did, in
<a href="orange-letters251.html#James_B" target="_blank">your previous letter</a>.
<p>
Or, were you doing a tongue-in-cheek reference to Alcoholics Anonymous members and their strange

Well, they don't really like Jesus. If you talk about Jesus too much, they will tell you to

&quot;You are in the wrong group if you are looking for Jesus. ...
you are one blind fuckwit.&quot;</a>

<p>
Why do I do this Orange Papers project? Simple: It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.
I kind of got stuck with the job.
<p>
I was involved in the anti-war movement back in the 'sixties. If someone spoke up at a meeting
and said, &quot;Somebody should do something about this...&quot;, then the meeting chairman would immediately
answer, &quot;Right. You are now the head of the committee to do it. Recruit whatever helpers you need,
and get it done. Next issue.&quot;
<p>
People quickly learned that saying &quot;Somebody should do something&quot;
was a sure-fire way to get stuck with the job.
<p>
Well, when I saw the hoax that is called &quot;drug and alcohol treatment&quot;,
I said, &quot;Somebody should do something about that...&quot;

<p>
Have a good day.

Thanks for the tip. Yes, the 12-Step vultures and ghouls are really feeding on that corpse.

<p>
But they aren't going to like the taste of it. The tox screens just came back negative,
so Amy Winehouse did not die from a drug or alcohol overdose.
So all of the vultures' crowing about how you have to buy their
12-Step &quot;treatment&quot; or you will die

Hello again Rodney,
<p>
Yes, A.A. members have made that line from Mark Twain into a slogan.

<p>
There is lots of other help out there for alcoholics. And better help, too.
For starters, there is SMART, SOS, Lifering, WFS, HAMS, and MM. Here is the list, with
web addresses:
<a href="orange-letters250.html#alt_list" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters250.html#alt_list</a>

<p>
When Dr. Brandsma and associates tested A.A. versus Cogitive Behavioral Therapy
(which is like SMART) versus Alcoholics
Anonymous, he found that A.A. was a disaster. Most of the A.A. group dropped out and did binge drinking.
Look here, and see below:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/effectiveness.html#Brandsma</a>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the worst ways to treat alcoholism,
and it produces one of the highest death rates of any way of treating alcohol abuse.
That death rate was proven by a doctor who went on to become a member of the Board of
Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous. Look here:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a>
<br>
Also see below.


<p>
Professors Reid K. Hester and William R. Miller (UNM, Albuquerque &#8212;
Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology,
University of New Mexico), rated treatment modalities by success rate.
Here are the results:<br>

<indent>
Prof. Miller's biography (on the back of his book <i>Controlling Your Drinking</i>, says:
<blockquote>
Prof. William R. Miller is Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at the
University of New Mexico. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>Motivational
Interviewing</i>, a modern classic in the field of addiction treatment. Dr. Miller's research,
which focuses on providing a broader and more effective range of treatment approaches
for people with alcohol and drug problems, has been supported by a 15-year Research Scientist
Award from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. He is a recipient of
the international Jellinek Memorial Award for excellence in alcoholism research.
</blockquote>
</indent>

<p>
I don't have Prof. Hester's biography handy, but I'm sure that it is also impressive.

<p>
The most successful treatment in that chart is &quot;Brief Intervention&quot;.<br>
<p>
Notice how &quot;Twelve-step facilitation&quot; is so far down the list
that you have to look for it. It's number 37 out of 48.
Also notice how 12-Step treatment has a <i>negative</i> success rating
&#8212; the &quot;Cumulative Evidence Score&quot; is a minus 82, while
the best treatments are rated positive 390 and 189.
<p>
&quot;Brief Intervention&quot; consists of a real doctor talking to the
patient for usually less than one hour, questioning him about all of the
ugly details of his drinking and telling him that he will die if he doesn't
quit drinking.  One time.
That's it. No long counseling sessions, no great guidance, no on-going
advice, no shoulder to cry on. And no 28-day treatment program.
Just one &quot;Dutch Uncle&quot; session and it's over.
And that's the most effective thing going.
<p>
That kind of puts the whole expensive &quot;drug-and-alcohol treatment
industry&quot; to shame, doesn't it?

<p>
Plenty of other medical tests have also shown that A.A. is a complete failure as a
treatment for alcoholism:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a> found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics. People who were sent to
A.A. ended up, after 9 months of A.A., doing FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got no such help, and NINE TIMES as much
binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy.

Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.

<p>
Agent Orange,

<p>
I have a question .

<p>
If 100 people contract a disease that will kill 50 of that 100  and I give
them a magic pill to all 100.<br>
And then  only 25 die instead of the 50.<br>
Are you saying (given a controlled experiment) that  the pill had no
effect?

<p>
If that is what you are saying then you argument wrong, it is not logical
or scientific
and therefore it brings into question the rest of your augments against
AA.

<p>
I detect a note of anti &#8212; religion to go along with your unfounded
premises.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tim,
<p>
Thanks for the question. If the numbers were what you stated, then the pill would be saving a
lot of lives. But that is not what A.A. does.
The &quot;A.A. pill&quot; INCREASES the death rate.
So it's more like 60 out of a hundred die when they get the A.A. pill.

<p>
The most damning evidence of the death rate of Alcoholics Anonymous came from Dr. George E. Vaillant,
who just loves A.A. and was trying hard to prove that A.A. works. Vaillant loves A.A. so
much that he is about the biggest proselytizer for A.A. in the world, and he went on to
become a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous. Vaillant was a Class A non-alcoholic
trustee.
<p>
Well, Dr. Vaillant helped to run the Cambridge-Sommerville [Massachusetts] Program for Alcohol Rehabilitation
(CASPAR). He treated 1000 new patients per year, did 2500 detoxifications
per year, and had 20,000 outpatient visits per year.
He used A.A. as the core of his treatment program.
<p>
Dr. Vaillant tracked his first 100 alcoholic patients for 8 years. At the end of 8 years, the
score was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
No other method of treating alcoholics that Dr. Vaillant studied had more deaths.

<p>
Dr. Vaillant declared that A.A. was a complete failure that didn't cure the alcoholics at all:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
After initial discharge, only five
patients in the Clinic sample <i>never</i> relapsed to alcoholic drinking,
and there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease.<br>
...
<p>
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
...
<p>
Once again, our results were no better than the natural history of the disorder.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i>, George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1983, pages 283-286.<br>

The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;The natural history of alcoholism&quot; means what usually happens to untreated alcoholics. You know,
&quot;Jails, Institutions, or Death&quot;. But also many spontaneous recoveries where people heal themselves.

<p>
You can read all about it here:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/effectiveness.html#Vaillant</a>
<p>
In the previous letter, I also talked about the medical tests where A.A. did more harm than good.
You should read that too, here:
<a href="orange-letters251.html#Rodney_R" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters251.html#Rodney_R</a>
<p>
By the way, when you are testing medicines, you don't just count the cure or death rate.
You also have to test for toxicity and nasty side effects.
A.A. scores badly on those items too.

<a href="orange-letters221.html#marriage" target="_blank">A.A. increases the divorce rate in alcoholics</a>,
and the
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">suicide rate</a>,
and irrational unrealistic thinking and cultish behavior.
Then some fundamentalist nutcase tells the newcomers not to take their doctor-prescribed
medications and just trust the 12 Steps to heal them, which results in more deaths.
And then of course there is the resident sexual predator who drives the young women out
of A.A.

<p>
About your last line, how you think that I am &quot;anti-religion&quot;, no, I'm not. I'm just against
harmful lying cult religions, no matter whether it's Scientology or the Moonies, or Hari Krishnas,
or FLDS (Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints), or the People's Temple, or ... on and on.
Or Alcoholics Anonymous. Or Narcotics Anonymous. Or Al-Anon...

Have a good day now.

Hi Orange,

Hello Vicki,
<p>
Thanks for the question. I think the answer depends on your definition of hypnosis. By a strict
definition of &quot;hypnosis&quot;, A.A. doesn't hypnotize people, but A.A. definitely uses elements of the
technique. Ken Ragge was the first one that I saw mention it:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Like a skilled hypnotherapist, a skilled AA speaker presents
statements in a certain order. A statement which otherwise would
be rejected has a much better chance of slipping into the subconscious
if it is immediately preceded by two or three unchallengeable statements.
For example, a hypnotherapist, while inducing trance, may say,
&quot;You can feel the weight of your body pressing down against the chair.
Take notice of your hands, whether they feel warm or cold.
Now notice how your breathing is becoming deeper and slower.&quot;
The first two statements are unchallengeable and the mind is
expecting another unchallengeable statement. In the third statement,
the instruction to &quot;notice how your breathing is becoming deeper
and slower . . .&quot; normally slips by the critical faculty and
the subconscious will act on it. <i>The client will notice how his
breathing is becoming deeper and slower.</i><br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> <i>The Real AA</i>, Ken Ragge, Chapter 9,
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222743/http://www.morerevealed.com/">&quot;Meetings,&quot;</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson used the technique this way:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This world of ours has made more material progress in the
last century than in all the millenniums which went before. Almost
everyone knows the reason. Students of
ancient history tell us that the intellect of men in those days
was equal to the best of today. Yet in ancient times material
progress was painfully
slow. The spirit of modern scientific inquiry, research
and invention was almost unknown.  In the realm of the
material, men's minds were fettered by superstition,
tradition, and all sorts of fixed ideas.  Some of the
contemporaries of Columbus thought a round earth
preposterous.  Others came near putting Galileo to
death for his astronomical heresies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We asked ourselves this: Are not some of us just
as biased and unreasonable about the realm of the spirit
as were the ancients about the realm of the
material?<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, page 51.)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
First Bill Wilson praised science and intellect and criticized superstition,
just to get your mind to open up to his rap, and to lull you into accepting his statements,
because he is sounding so sensible.
Then he switched sides and tried to sell you the very superstition
&#8212; &quot;the realm of the spirit&quot; &#8212; that he had just been criticizing.
<i>Bait and Switch.</i> I have that technique listed on the
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-propaganda.html" target="_blank">Propaganda Techniques web page</a>
as
<a href="http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-propaganda.html#bait_switch" target="_blank">Hypnotic Bait-And-Switch</a>.

<p>
I also wrote about that paragraph more in the file on
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#bas_logic" target="_blank">A.A. and Religious Faith</a>.


<p>
That isn't exactly hypnosis, but A.A. definitely uses elements of it.
Bill Wilson may have been crazy, but he wasn't stupid. He knew how
to play mind games, and get people to join his cult.
<p>
Of course. He was trained by Frank Buchman's disciples in
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">The Oxford Group</a>,
so he had a solid education in cult religion.
They taught him everything he
needed to know about ego reduction, guilt induction, false logic,
propaganda and persuasion techniques, deceptive recruiting, and
other cult religion mind games.
Then he even took courses by Dale Carnegie based on
<i>&quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;</i>, where
he learned
<a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html#hiding_behind">how to sugar-coat
his objectionable statements</a>.
Bill Wilson was quite consciously, deliberately,
cleverly, manipulating and influencing people's minds.
<p>
He may have been crazy, but he wasn't stupid.

<p>
<a name="logic_great"> </a>
Speaking of bad logic, Wilson then wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Logic is great stuff. We liked it. We still like it. It is not by
chance we were given the power to reason, to examine the evidence
of our senses, and to draw conclusions. That is one of man's
magnificent attributes. We agnostically inclined would not feel
satisfied with a proposal which does not lend itself to reasonable
approach and interpretation. Hence we are at pains to tell why
we think our present faith is reasonable, why we think it more
sane and logical to believe, why we say our former thinking was
soft and mushy when we threw up our hands in doubt and said,
&quot;We don't know.&quot;<br></font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th Editions,
William G. Wilson, Page 53.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson was misusing the word &quot;logic&quot;.
There is nothing &quot;logical&quot; about
blind faith in a cult religion. Logic is a thought process where one examines
facts and then draws conclusions from them, using inductive or deductive reasoning.

<p>
Bill was using his
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#bait_switch" target="_blank">hypnotic bait-and-switch trick</a> again. He
started the paragraph by praising logic and saying that he liked it.
But then, when he had you going along with him,
he switched sides and attacked logic, and praised blind faith
<i>in his beliefs</i> as being more logical than logic itself.
<p>
And it's funny how Bill admitted that he was
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;at pains to tell why we think our present faith is reasonable,
why we think it more sane and logical to believe...&quot;</font>
The reason that it is so hard to defend that point of view is because
it is completely irrational and illogical. It is based on no facts at all.
It is just so much wishful thinking.

<p>
Then Step 11 is also hypnotic in another way:  it is trance-inducing.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
conscious contact with God <i>as we understood Him</i>, praying only
for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</b>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you just pray and meditate until you hear voices in your head, telling you what to do.

<p>
No thanks.
<p>
Have a good day now.
