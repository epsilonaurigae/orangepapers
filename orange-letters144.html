Subject:  	orange-cult<br>

<p>
why is it that although different in points of view, every cult has the same agenda
and the same M.O.? I was thrown head-first into a cult at the age of seven and left
at 14. I became an agnostic but was still troubled and searched for god. I returned
to the source of my doubts at 20. I've spent 2 years there. At first I did my best
to live in the movie despite my lack of faith and inability to suspend disbelief.
<p>
After a year i began taking off the blinders and coming to the realization that many
of your points illuminate so well. now I have lost everything. my wife and my
newborn daughter are trapped by one form or another and i loathe the idea that my
daughter will grow up with the same thought killing logic that has already damaged
so many. i don't know what to do. The so-called church matches roughly 90 percent of
all your points and my wife isn't keen enough to realize that this is in fact not a
healthy environment to raise a child. how do i get through to her when she is
surrounded by so many dissenting voices that drown me, the enemy, out?

Hello Benjamin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I'm sorry to hear about your suffering.
Sorry to take so long to answer &#8212; I'm backlogged on answering email.

<p>
Most all cults have the same basic agenda because that is just the nature of the
beast. They do not invent their recruiting and brainwashing
techniques; they just reuse the same
stuff over and over, for centuries and millenia.
<p>
It reminds me of viruses.
When you hear about an influenza virus like H5N1, all that the label means is,
&quot;This virus used the fifth standard way of getting into a cell,
and the first standard way to get back out.&quot;
The rest of the virus' program is always the same: Take over
control of the cell
and work it to death making more copies of the virus.
<p>
Similarly, cults always want to recruit and take over peoples' thinking
processes and make clones.
Various cults may appear to be different on the surface &#8212; some cults
dress in outlandish costumes from foreign countries, and others dress
in old traditional American costumes from 200 years ago, while others
wear regular, ordinary, contemporary dress. And cults may jabber different
slogans and proclaim different religious beliefs (or even non-religious
beliefs). But they all have the same agenda:
recruit and indoctrinate and change the newcomers into &quot;one of us&quot;.
Reproduce more of &quot;our kind&quot;.
(<i>&quot;Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.&quot;</i>)
<p>
I just ran across this in another book on escaping from cults:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif"> 
Frequently, at gatherings of former cult members, a lively exchange
takes place when participants compare their respective groups and
leaders. As people begin to describe their special, enlightened,
and unique leader &#8212; whether a pastor, therapist, political leader,
teacher, lover, or swami &#8212; those present are often surprised to learn
that their once-revered leaders are actually quite similar in
temperament and personality. It seems as if those leaders come from
a common mold, sometimes light-heartedly called the
&quot;Cookie-Cutter Messiah School.&quot;<br>

That book is good, by the way. I recommend that and this one:

<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="_blank"><i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i> by Steven Hassan</a>.

Hassan's book is specifically about how to rescue a loved one from a cult,

<p>
Also check out anti-cult forums, even the anti-12-Step forums.
Some of the people in those forums
are quite knowledgeable and have been in two or more cults, and have
also noticed the similarities.
They may also have some helpful advice. Many such forums are listed
at the start of

Good luck, and have a good day.

I think that the &quot;high regard&quot; for Alcoholics Anonymous is
self-assigned &#8212; they are the ones who broadcast the message that
A.A. is great and has saved millions.

Dear Orange,

<p>
My girlfriend was arrested and released for a PI. She agreed
she was wrong and was willing to accept the terms of probation, except
she is required to AA meetings. We are both atheist and refused to
participate in the AA cult. She told the probation officer she wanted to
attend another program (SOS, RR, Women for Sobriety), but he became very
rude and verbally abusive, insisting that she only go to AA or go to jail
for 6 months. To make a long story short she has another court date
because she refused to sign a paper saying she would attend AA meetings,
so there is a real possibility of jail. I was wondering if you could put
me in contact with somebody who may be able to assist us in this
matter.

Hi Ian,

You didn't say what country you are in. The USA? If so,
the ACLU may be able to help. Forcing people to attend
the services of a cult religion is blatantly unconstitutional.

Yep, it's libel. But that's nothing new. It just seems to come with the territory.
When facts fail the true believers, they resort to name-calling and libel and slander.
It's really standard operating procedure.

If not, I wanted you to be aware of what's been going on over at Wired In, a

This Tim Leighton person writes:

&quot;I have seen various examples, some of which clearly originate in a kind
of online manifesto published by someone who calls himself (or herself)
Agent Orange. The so-called &quot;Orange Papers&quot; are in parts intelligent
and cogent critique of the more egregious absurdities in the 12 Step
literature, but the way in which the author uses so-called research
evidence is extremely dubious, and despite academic-looking references,
the inferences and conclusions drawn are either illegitimate or
irrelevant to the current situation.&quot;

Hello Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the note. I wasn't aware of that forum, but obviously this debate is going
on all over the world.  And the mind games and propaganda tricks are going on all
over the world too.
<p>
The fact that they banned you from speaking pretty much tells you everything you need
to know about their interest in the truth.  Some people want to learn the truth, and
some people just want to hear their favorite superstitions repeated, and they can
become quite hostile if you challenge their cherished illusions (or delusions).

<p>
I'll have to check them out.

<p>
By the way, I noticed that this Tim did not actually state a single fact about
my writings. He did not list one citation that is wrong or &quot;illegitimate or irrelevant&quot;;.
He just made sweeping, broad generalizations devoid of any specifics, unsupported
by any evidence.  That's another typical cult style of attack.
I think it qualifies as another flavor of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i></a>.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.
<p>
P.S., no, I'm not &quot;dharmabum&quot;, and I didn't see your forum.
I rarely get into Yahoo any more. I pretty much boycott them because they erased

The connection to A.A. that comes to mind is all of the dire predictions

<p>
Author: Roger F.<br>
Topic: The Agent Orange Web-site

<p>
&quot;Not-so-secret&quot; Agent Orange:

<p>
I have visited your web-site several times over the past few years.
I  came across it while I was conducting historical research on Tom P., an
early AA  member. Yours was one of the few Internet sources that mentioned
Tom. But it  became immediately apparent to me that you really did not know
what you were  talking about even with reference to this single individual
(see below).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Roger,
<p>
This should be interesting. I  have always wanted to learn more about Tom Powers.
</font>
<p>
Reading through some of your essays on A.A. at large, I was alternatively
amused and appalled. I guess that I like to be amused and/or appalled since
I  have returned to this site on several occasions since then.

<p>
By way of disclosure, I am currently an active A.A. member. My sobriety
date is 29 January, 1980. I am a &quot;first time winner.&quot; I have not consumed any
alcohol since that day. I have never been admitted to a rehabilitation or
detoxification center. I am firmly convinced that participation in A.A.
helped  me to get sober and to stay sober. For that I am grateful.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on keeping yourself sober. Obviously, you did not need the A.A. program
to quit drinking. You had decided to quit before going to your first meeting. And you
did. You weren't drinking when you went into the meeting, were you?
</font>
<p>
We have some things in common. I too am an &quot;old hippie&quot; and I attended
graduate school at U Cal Berkeley (1969-1970) before dropping out as a
consequence of my inability to support myself by dealing marijuana (I got ripped
off). I am also familiar with drugs, including LSD, cocaine, heroin, and
methadone. I have not used any of these substances during the past 30 years.

<p>
To create at least a semblance of objectivity, I would note some
significant points of agreement with the opinions that you have  expressed.
You are &quot;correct&quot; on several key points (by &quot;correct&quot; I mean that  your
views are congruent with my own).

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is very revealing. &quot;Correct&quot; is whatever coincides with your beliefs?
I guess then, a &quot;lie&quot; is whatever you don't like, right?
</font>
<p>
First, no one should ever be sentenced, mandated or coerced by any court,
government administrative agency or employee assistance office into
attending  A.A. meetings
From my standpoint, there are three reasons for this.
<ul>
<li>
First, it is not likely to work for the patient or client. Rates of A.A.
affiliation by court-mandated individuals are extremely low, relapse rates
within this group are extremely high.
<li>
Second, such mandates are  unconstitutional and an offense to the
individual liberty of freedom of (and  from) religion. As the U.S. Supreme Court has
recognized, there is enough  religious content presented to A.A. attendees
for mandated attendance at A.A.  meetings to qualify as a violation of the
First Amendment.
<li>
Third, as the  person who arranges for and often distributes &quot;proof of
attendance&quot; cards at  meetings, I have found that the vast majority of
individuals who are sentenced  to A.A. do not attend meetings once they have
collected enough cards. I suspect  that many (probably most) really don't want to
stop drinking. A.A. is not  effective with these people. The task of
accommodating their need for proof  attendance is a pain in my rear end and diverts
my attention from interacting  with people who actually want to get and stay
sober.
</ul>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now there we are in agreement.
</font>
<p>
I also agree that 12-steppers and former 12-steppers currently dominate
both the official ideology and the working positions within the substance
abuse  rehabilitation industry. Based on casual observation, I suspect that A.A.'s
hegemony is largely an artifact of perceived convenience and short-term,
misguided considerations of cost effectiveness.  Having these 12-steppers
direct clients to A.A. and expose them to a few A.A. concepts (usually as
mere  slogans) is easy and cheap when compared to most other forms of
treatment. There  are a lot of current/former A.As. who think that they can (or
somehow need) to  become treatment professionals. The supply of such personnel
is large and this  reduces labor costs. Dominance within a human services
profession that stems  from convenience is bound to have ill effects,
including highly unqualified  personnel posing as counselors.  I have found that
many (but certainly not  all) A.A. members who become professional &quot;industry&quot;
workers are poor counselors  and lousy A.A. members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds about right.
</font>
<p>
I also believe that Bill W. was a dirt-bag. It's the adultery part that
kills me, but there is more. I have spoken on several occasions with a man
from  New Jersey who had been continuously sober since 1941 (he died in 2000).
He knew  Bill W. (and several of the early members whose stories appeared in
the 1st  edition of the &quot;Big Book&quot;). In his recollection, many A.A.
members in the New  York area did not like Bill, his enormous ego, and his
hypocrisies. At bottom,  Bill's behavior was indefensible.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I've heard that before too. Not everybody admired or worshipped Bill W.  He was
charismatic, but not that charismatic. Lots of people quit in disgust, and Clarence
Snyder criticized Bill Wilson's chicanery strongly.

<p>
Now, I turn to the gist of my criticism dealing first with A.A.'s  &quot;efficacy&quot; rate.
I recall that you admire and recommend Rational Recovery.  On RR's website
we find an FAQ which asks: Is RR more effective than A.A? The  answer given
by RR is that the treatment efficacy of RR and A.A. cannot be  conclusively
determined by recognized standards of empirical research.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I disagree. It's really very simple: Send 100 or 1000 alcoholics to Alcoholics Anonymous,
and see how many of them are sober a year later. And still sober 5 or 10 years later.
At the same time, watch another similar group of 100 or 1000
alcoholics who get no treatment or &quot;help&quot;, and see how many of them quit drinking on
their own. Then compare the results from the two groups.
<p>
When the same numbers of alcoholics get sober in both groups, you know that Alcoholics
Anonymous is completely ineffective and doesn't help the alcoholics. When the A.A. group has
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">a higher death rate</a>,
and
<a href="orange-letters139.html#suicide" target="_blank">a higher suicide rate</a>,
then you know that A.A. is doing something very harmful.

</font>
<p>
Here I note that the bulk of published &quot;A.A. research&quot; has been conducted
with in-patient samples receiving Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) treatment
or  with outpatient samples. Neither group reliably represents &quot;newcomers&quot;
who  attend A.A. meetings nor does their experience reliably represent
membership in  A.A. There is no way of determining an efficacy rate within a
natural setting  among individuals who are anonymous. None. Nevertheless,
several recent works  (including a few studies conducted with samples recruited
from actual A.A.  groups) strongly suggests that A.A. is as effective or
slightly more effective  than alternative alcoholism treatment approaches.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Who cares if they are anonymous? I care whether they get healthy or die. Arguing that the
test procedures are not &quot;natural&quot; is just a dodge to avoid admitting failure.
What matters most is whether the sick alcoholics quit drinking and regain their heath
and get a new lease on life. And A.A. fails to make them do that.
Period.
</font>
<p>
At several junctures, you cite George Vaillant's work and claim that he
repudiated his support for A.A.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<b>NO!</b>
That is wrong, completely wrong. I never said that Dr. Vaillant repudiated
his support for A.A. I said
just the opposite: that Dr. Vaillant was such a true believer that he insisted that people
should get shoved into A.A. in spite of the complete failure of A.A. to get the
alcoholics to quit drinking, and in spite of the high A.A. death rate. Vaillant wanted those
alcoholics to get &quot;an attitude change&quot; by
&quot;confessing their sins to a high-status healer&quot;.
Vaillant is such a true believer in A.A. that he could, on one page of his
<i>Natural History of Alcoholism</i> book, declare that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the A.A. death rate was &quot;appalling&quot;</a>,
but within four pages, he was raving about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#assume_premise" target="_blank">&quot;the success of A.A.&quot;</a>.
No, Dr. Vaillant never allowed mere facts to get in the way of his belief in Buchmanism.
</font>
<p>
Here is the abstract for Vaillant's last  published essay on A.A within a
peer-reviewed journal published under the title  of &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous:
Cult or Cure&quot; within a 2005 issue of the Australian  and New Zealand Journal
of Psychiatry,  39(6), 431-436

<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Objective: To discuss the mechanism of action, the efficacy and the safety
of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in the treatment of alcoholism.<br>
Method: The  published works on effective treatments for alcoholism is
briefly reviewed and a  prospective multidisciplinary follow-up of recovery from
alcoholism in two  community cohorts of adolescent males followed from 1940
until the present day  is reviewed.<br>
Conclusions: The suggested mechanism of action of AA is that it  employs
four factors widely shown to be effective in relapse prevention in
addictions: external supervision, substitute dependency, new caring  relationships and
increased spirituality. In addition, AA serendipitously  follows the
principles of cognitive behaviour therapy in relapse prevention.  Alcoholics
Anonymous appears equal to or superior to conventional treatments for
alcoholism, and the skepticism of some professionals regarding AA as a first  rank
treatment for alcoholism would appear to be unwarranted. Alcoholics  Anonymous
is probably without serious side-effects<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
We have discussed that article before, at length, a couple of times,
<a href="orange-letters30.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters90.html#summary" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am well aware of the religious diatribes contained in that article.
Vaillant's whole thrust is that religion is divisive and bad, but A.A. is good spirituality. 

</font>
<p>
In fact, the studies that you cite in support of the statement that A.A.
does not work are invariably very old and of decidedly poor in quality. I do
not  have the time to provide a full critique of these studies. Here's
something that  can be readily understood.

<p>
Take, for example, Brandsma et al. (1977, reproduced in 1980). The final
study populace here was 46 subjects! In Brandsma et al. (1985), the final
sample  was comprised of just 37 participants! Anyone who has any familiarity
with  social science research will recognize in an instant that these
&quot;studies&quot; cannot  yield statistically valid findings. The samples are just too
small.  The  same can be said of Ditman et al. and the Sobells research. Yet you
cite them  throughout.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Is that the best objection that you have? The sample sizes are too small
for your liking?  Yes, it would be better &#8212; more convincing &#8212;  if
the test groups were larger, but sometimes you have to use what you get.
<p>
And yes, you can get some meaningful findings from such studies, especially when
the A.A. group did <i>five times</i> as much binge drinking as the control group,
and <i>nine times</i> as much binge drinking as the rational behavior therapy group.
Such huge differences are much more than a small statistical anomaly.
We are not talking about one standard deviation there.

<p>
And another fact to consider is that ALL of the randomized longitudinal controlled
studies ever done gave basically the same results: A.A. does not work.  There has never been a
properly-conducted randomized longitudinal controlled
study that showed that A.A. works. They all showed that A.A. failed to help the
alcoholics, and had bad side effects. That isn't a small statistical error.

<p>
But it would be nice to have larger tests. Let's lobby the
National Institutes for Health
and have them do a really large <i>randomized longitudinal controlled study</i> 
that tests a variety of methods of treating alcoholism and drug addiction, including
12-Step cult religion, Scientology cult religion, Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy,
Brief Intervention, Addictive Voice Recognition Technique,
and a bunch of others. We can get more ideas for things to test from
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731090748/http://www.behaviortherapy.com/ResearchDiv/whatworks.aspx">this chart of the effectiveness
of various treatment modalities</a>.
</font>
<p>
To mention yet another shortcoming of your &quot;review of the literature,&quot; you
seem to be under the impression that Project Match yielded a single study.
In  fact, more than dozen published studies using the Project Match
database have  appeared in print. Those that have attempted to evaluate efficacy
rates for A.A.  in comparison to other treatment modalities have concluded
that A.A. is as  effective or slightly more effective than alternative
treatment modalities

<p>
<font color="blue">
You mean that a dozen different authors rehashed the invalid data from Project MATCH.
Obviously, those so-called &quot;studies&quot; are worthless, because the results from
Project MATCH were worthless. Garbage in, garbage out.
<p>
Project MATCH had no control group. They paid alcoholics to
come to meetings where bastardized versions of either 12-Step theology,
cognitive-behavioral therapy, or motivational therapy were taught.
They cherry-picked which alcoholics went into which group.
And the results were so muddled that it didn't matter which garbage the alcoholics got.
The results were the same.
<p>
And earlier, you complained that tests of A.A. were not &quot;natural&quot;. What a laugh.

<p>
We have talked about Project MATCH before,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH" target="_blank">here</a>.
</font>
<p>
In fact, at present (it is, after all, 2009) most of the work within this
research domain has proceeded on the basis of a &quot;dose-response&quot; model.
These  studies uniformly indicate a direct correlation between
frequency/intensity of  A.A. exposure (the &quot;dose&quot;) in the form of meeting attendance
(and/or
other  related variables like having a sponsor or steps completed) and
abstinence from  alcohol (the &quot;response&quot;).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Translation: those who become true believers in the cult, and devote their lives to
the cult, drink less than the people who go back to the bars. I can believe that.
<p>
But it is backwards, invalid, logic to assume that exposure to A.A. reduced drinking.
I can repeat such a &quot;study&quot; and find that people who frequent
Baskin Robbins ice cream parlors
drink less alcohol than the people who go to bars. And the more often the test subjects
are exposed to the ice cream meetings, the less they drink.
The logical conclusion is that we should treat all of the alcoholics with ice cream.

</font>
<p>
What really pisses me off about your presentation of the available data is
that you engage in &quot;apples and oranges&quot; comparisons while railing against
this  shop-worn abuse.
<p>
You routinely cite an errant interpretation of a 1988 A.A.  demographic
survey as the basis for the assertion that A.A. does not work. The  survey
itself was not designed to generate findings of any kind save the  information
needed to construct a demographic profile of the fellowship.
<p>
Through indirect methods, some A.A. personnel concluded that the survey
indicated a very low rate of affiliation among newcomers (many, if not most,
of  whom, were court-mandated).
<p>
The evidence that can be extrapolated from  this survey indicates (but does
not demonstrate) that this is the case.
<p>
Yet  it says nothing (absolutely nothing!) about the actual treatment
efficacy of  A.A.
<p>
Through ignorance, willful abuse, or both, you nevertheless present
this &quot;finding&quot; as proof positive that A.A. does not work. That's just nonsense
and you should know better.  Spencer is rolling in his grave.  Worse,  on the
one hand, you interpret an individual's (permanent or temporary)
termination of A.A. meeting attendance as proof that A.A. does not work. On the
other, you interpret continued A.A. attendance as proof of brainwashing by a
dangerous cult.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You really don't like
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">that internal A.A. report</a>,
do you?  The A.A. dropout rate
is sky-high. And that's that.
That dropout rate has been repeatedly verified a number of times, in a variety of ways.
It is not just a
declining curve from one internal A.A. headquarters report.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;A well conducted professional study&quot; showed that
&quot;some 5% of newcomers are still attending meetings

<p>

&quot;There were alcoholics in the hospitals of whom A.A. could touch and help

so that the resistance would be broken down. And they had about

</blockquote>
<p>
It would seem that LSD is much more effective than A.A.
<p>
Lastly, you declared,
<font color="black">
&quot;Worse,  on the
one hand, you interpret an individual's (permanent or temporary)
termination of A.A. meeting attendance as proof that A.A. does not work.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Now you and I both know that it is a standard A.A. slogan &#8212; really, many slogans &#8212;
that declare that if you leave A.A. you will die drunk in a gutter:
<ul>
<li> &quot;If you leave, you'll come back on your knees.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;If you leave A.A., your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Don't leave five minutes before the miracle.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;People who leave just want to drink.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Anyone wanting to leave should take a close look at their motivation.&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;A.A.'s like the Mafia &#8212; If you leave it, you die.&quot;<br>
</ul>
<p>
But now you are trying to claim the A.A. drop-outs and quitters as wonderful A.A. success stories?
You've got to be joking.
<p>
I know full well that many people who leave A.A. do get sober later. And A.A. is not due
any credit for that. A.A. still failed to sober them up when it had them.
Those alcoholics got sober by their own efforts, using their own intelligence and
will power.
<p>
And even if somebody gets sober while attending some A.A. meetings,
and then leaves and stays sober, there is still no reason to give
A.A. the credit for the sobriety.
People do not quit drinking because of the 12 Steps or any of that nonsense.
The real reasons why people quit drinking
are things like: to avoid death, to get healthy, to save a marriage or career,
to stop the pain, to improve one's lifestyle, and so on.
<p>
Again, A.A. does not increase the amount of sobriety in the world. A.A. does not make
alcoholics quit drinking.
</font>
<p>
Based upon my own experience in sponsoring 18 men over the years (and my
rough count of the individuals who have been sponsored in turn by these men)
I  know that A.A. works IF the individual takes at least some of the
suggestions  given to him or her. The sample is admittedly small. But I know this
people, I  know many of their families and I have watched some of them for
more than 25  years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are using the standard qualifiers: &quot;A.A. works IF....&quot;
<p>
Well, dancing around in a ballerina's tutu also works, IF the alcoholic really
works a strong program, and always dances instead of drinks alcohol....
<p>
Eating ice cream works, IF the alcoholic always eats ice cream instead of drinking alcohol.
<p>
Those are meaningless statements.
</font>
<p>
As for A.A. being a cult here's a question for you: How many &quot;cults&quot;
regularly change leaders through elections based on broad participation as A.A.
does?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney.
<a href="orange-pamphlet2.html" target="_blank">The membership censured the A.A.W.S. leadership</a>
for committing perjury in Germany and
Mexico over the <i>Big Book</i> copyright, and the leadership told them to get lost.
The members do not and cannot actually elect the real leaders. They
can only elect powerless figure-heads.
All of the real power resides in the Interchurch Building in New York City, and those
leaders elect themselves, and keep themselves in power. A.A. is a fake democracy.
<p>
By the way, there is much more to a cult than simply having a charismatic,
dictatorial leader. Cults do things like guilt induction, indoctrination, deceptive
recruiting, phobia induction, teaching irrational dogma, constant put-downs,
enemy-making, isolation, and loaded language. A.A. does all of those things.
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="newwin77">See the cult test for more, here</a>.

</font>
<p>
Here's another (albeit of a different sort): Have you ever been to an  A.A.
group business meeting?<br>
I have. In these sessions there are differences  of opinion (with due
respect for minority viewpoints) and some groups even have  difficulty in filling
positions or commitments (to other groups) because members  either cannot
or will not step up and perform these functions. If A.A. is a  cult, it sure
is a weak one (LOL).

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I attended one too. So you have a meeting where you discuss donations and expenses.
So what?
<p>
A.A. is a different kind of cult, which is how it has managed to fly under the radar for
so long. The real money is in the treatment centers, which happily charge anything from
$1700 to $40,000 for introduction to quackery and goofy religion.
<p>
But then again, A.A. is more about stealing peoples' minds and souls than taking money.
</font>
<p>
Along the way you mention Stanton Peele, the Trimpeys and Chaz Bufe. I  can't resist.
<p>
<ul>
<a name="Edwards"> </a>
<li> Peele (a lawyer and psychiatrist who has taken grant money  from the
distilled spirits industry) has routinely criticized A.A. Yet after  Moderation
Management (MM) founder Audrey Kishline had her slip (and killed two  people
in the process), Peele and Archie Brodsky signed a statement which  concluded
&quot;We believe that the approach represented by Alcoholics Anonymous and  that
represented by Moderation Management are both needed.&quot;
Peele published  several alternative statements on the Kishline affair. But
he signed the one  quoted above.<br>
As for Peele's &quot;research,&quot; I cite from Griffith Edwards review  of Peele's
<i>Meaning of Addiction</i> for the British Journal of Addiction. Edwards  wrote,
<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;with these and other issues treated in cavalier fashion, with  referencing
highly incomplete and crucial work often ignored, one begins to feel  that
this is a book where polemic and scholarship have become inextricably and
unhappily mixed&quot; (1985, p.448).
</blockquote>
Edwards did not go far as Jack Trimpey, who
considers Peele to be &quot;the devil&quot;  (I'm not sure how that squares with
rationality). In my opinion, the Trimpeys have their own, profit-driven agenda.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You do know, don't you, that Griffith Edwards is a professional 12-Step apologist and salesman?
We have discussed him before too,
<a href="orange-letters90.html#Griffith_Edwards" target="_blank">here</a>.

<p>
Griffith Edwards participated in one of the largest and longest and most expensive
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">randomized longitudinal controlled studies of A.A. treatment in England</a>.
That test established that a whole year of A.A.-based treatment was no more effective than
a doctor talking to the alcoholics for just one hour, one time ever.
Then Edwards ignored those results that he didn't like,
and kept on promoting Alcoholics Anonymous anyway.
</font>
<p>
<li> As for Chaz Bufe, he's just nuts. Bufe is a loony anarchist and a militant
atheist.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And there we have it. Anybody who disagrees with you is just nuts, huh?
And what evidence do you have to back up your slander and libel?
You are quick to accuse and libel, but short on facts.
<p>
By the way, even if someone is an atheist, that does not disqualify him from reporting
about quack medicine.
</font>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="Tom_Powers"> </a>
As for your A.A. &quot;historical&quot; research, its useful in the sense that it
brings to light some &quot;embarrassing&quot; aspects of A.A.'s past that General
Service  has been unwilling to fully acknowledge or even actively suppressed.
But your  work is superficial and often errant. You claim, for example, that
Tom P.  &quot;co-authored&quot; the book <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> with Bill
W. In fact,  Tom reviewed these 24 essays but was unable to make more than a
few emendations  due to what he characterized as Bill's &quot;Elizabethan&quot;
prose style. Your follow-up  work on the drinking status of the contributors to
the first edition of the Big  Book is, in many cases, wrong and you
misidentify several of the authors.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Please give your sources of information. Where did you get that story?
Other, more knowledgeable people have said that Tom Powers quit A.A. because Bill
Wilson cheated Tom out of his share of the royalties for the book
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>.
So Tom went off to northern New York State and started his own recovery group.
My source of information is Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's secretary, who
went upstate and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP" target="_blank">interviewed Tom Powers</a>.
And another correspondent communicated with Tom Powers' assistant after Powers' death.
What are your sources of information?
<p>
Francis Hartigan quoted Tom Powers saying that Bill Wilson destroyed
&quot;what had been a very enjoyable and productive working
relationship&quot; between the two of them. &quot;A productive working
relationship&quot; is a lot more than Tom
just reviewing some articles and saying that they can't be fixed.

<p>
Remember that when <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i> was written,
Bill Wilson was in the middle of a crippling 11-year-long bout of clinical depression.
Some days, all that he could do was sit in his office and hold his head in his
hands all day long, or lay in bed and stare at the ceiling all day.
Wilson needed a lot of help to get that book done.
And Tom Powers was there, living near the Wilson's house <i>Stepping Stones</i> in
Bedford Hills, and also participating in Bill Wilson's
daily &quot;spook sessions&quot; and s&eacute;ances.
<p>
Oh, and Bill Wilson did not write in an &quot;Elizabethan
prose style&quot;. That sounds suspiciously like another one of Bill Wilson's
self-aggrandizing stories. That's as ridiculous as Bill's story
<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#Hemingway" target="_blank">where Jack Alexander
supposedly said</a>
that Bill Wilson's writing style in
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>
was &quot;mechanical&quot;, but better than Hemingway.
There is a huge difference between &quot;mechanical&quot;
and &quot;Elizabethan&quot;.
Neither Bill Wilson nor Tom Powers wrote like either Shakespeare or Hemingway.

<p>
Which <i>Big Book</i> authors did I misidentify? Please be specific.
What did I get wrong about the relapsers?  Please don't hold back on the facts.
I want to correct any errors in
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">that page</a>,
so what are the errors, exactly, precisely? And what is the correct information?
And what is your documentation and what are your sources of facts?
You keep making these sweeping statements backed up by no specific facts.
<p>
Perhaps you would like to compare
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#coauthors" target="_blank">my list of
<i>Big Book</i> authors here</a> with
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731090748/http://silkworth.net/aabiography/storyauthors.html" target="_blank">Silkworth.net's list here</a>.
So what did I get wrong? Or rather, what did all of us get wrong &#8212;
all of the Silkworth.net contributors, and me?
</font>
<p>
Finally, your approach to dealing with the &quot;Beast&quot; appears to consist of
thinking the next drink (or the next cigarette) through and self-talking the
&quot;Beast&quot; into submission. Now, A.A. encourages this as well. I have not
thought  about drinking for a long time. But my first defense against the next
one was  (and is) to recall my last drink (so far) and to think through the
possible  consequences of taking the next one.
<p>
However, this may not be sufficient.  The &quot;Beast&quot; is stubborn and elusive.
What A.A. advises in such cases is to talk  about such urges or manias with
another recovering alcoholic. I have done that  as well. It works.  I had
plenty of people to talk with on these occasions.  They were fellow members.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is zero evidence to support your belief that talking with other alcoholics
makes alcoholics quit drinking or stay sober. All of the valid tests showed A.A. to
be ineffective, and even harmful. We seem to keep on coming back to that.

<p>
You keep saying that &quot;it works&quot;, based on nothing.  Once again, please answer the
question that true believers in A.A. have <i>never</i> honestly answered:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a>.)

</font>
<p>
There is a lot more than I could say. I will not engage in ad hominen
attacks. Granted, I have criticized your website's contents and this criticism
has extended to your pretensions and touched upon your motivations.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You won't engage in <i>ad hominem</i> attacks? You already have. Against Stanton Peele and
Charles Bufe.
</font>
<p>
I have no idea why you maintain the Agent Orange website. It seems to have
something to do with an incident involving an insulting remark,
your &quot;feeling&quot;  something amiss after one or more A.A. meetings.
But as for your claim that  the motivation is to declare the &quot;truth,&quot; I don't buy that for one minute.
<p>
<p>
<font color="blue">
</font>
<p>
<p>
Yours truly,
Roger F.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You won't engage in <i>ad hominem</i> attacks? That was another one, again supported by no facts.
<p>
So you won't &quot;buy it&quot;? You will obviously believe whatever you wish
to believe, and disregard the rest. &quot;Truth&quot; is whatever
agrees with your beliefs and prejudices.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
