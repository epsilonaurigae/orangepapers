From:   &quot;Jon K&quot;<br>
Subject:        Your scholarship<br>


Mr. Orange,

<p>

In your article, &quot;What's Not Good About A.A.,&quot;
<a href="orange-not_good.html">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-not_good.html</a>,
you claim that A.A.
has been statistically proven to be ineffective.  The study you cite
refers to the success rate of vague &quot;spiritual therapy&quot; programs that
you assert (without conclusive evidence) were &quot;based on the A.A.
Twelve-Step program.&quot;  So the study does not prove what you purport it
to prove.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jon,
<p>
Get real. You pointedly ignored the next paragraph on that page, which supplies
just the evidence you are demanding:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
The only possible mathematical
explanation is that A.A. kills one patient
for each one that it saves, thus making the effective success rate balance out at zero.
And that is, in fact, actually believable, given just how bad the
so-called &quot;treatment program&quot; really is, and how high the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">A.A. failure rate</a> and the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. death rate</a> really are. Read on.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Especially look at the death rate link. That is Dr. George E. Vaillant, who is now
a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc., and
who is one of the
biggest A.A. promoters in the world. At the Cambridge-Sommerville Hospital, he
spent the better part of 20 years shoving 
A.A. on alcoholics and trying to prove that A.A. works. In the end, he had to conclude
that A.A. was completely ineffective and had an appalling death rate.
And Vaillant wasn't using some vague spiritual therapy, he was using Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Oh, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment">that first link
that led to a study of treatment in general</a>,
and its failure, is a valid reference because
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html#TC_study">93% of all of the treatment
centers in the USA use 12-Step treatment programs</a>.
So the failure of treatment in general is specifically
the failure of 12-Step-based treatment programs.
</font>
<p>

On a more qualitative front, you offer the example of President George
W. Bush to show that A.A. is not necessary for recovery for alcoholism.
Bush, as far as you provide, has never labeled himself an alcoholic,
only a &quot;heavy drinker.&quot;  I spent my college years living in a fraternity
house full of &quot;heavy drinkers,&quot; very few of which were alcoholics or
potential alcoholics.  I refer you to pages 20-21 of the 4^th Ed. of the
Big Book, for an explanation of the difference.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is no mention of George Bush anywhere on that
&quot;What's Not Good About A.A.&quot; web page.
You must have gone off somewhere else. Specifically, what are you referring to?
<p>
In general, I do not cite Bush as an example of successful recovery.
I regard G. W. Bush as a mental
defective who seriously damaged his brain with 20 years of cocaine and whiskey.
I think he's insane.
<p>
I repeatedly asked why the A.A. people aren't calling G. W. Bush a dry drunk for
quitting drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
I see that you are trying to weasle out of the question by claiming that Bush
wasn't really an alcoholic, just a &quot;heavy drinker&quot;.
&quot;Heavy drinker&quot; is what fashionably rich alcoholics call themselves.

<p>
Bill's Bull on pages 20-21 of the <i>Big Book</i> is meaningless garbage. Bill also attempted
to weasle out of the question by claiming that if you can quit drinking without
A.A., then you aren't really an alcoholic. There is no truth to that nonsense.
That is just an attempt to explain away all of the alcoholics who successfully
quit drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous. That is just another cultish claim
that, for &quot;real&quot; alcoholics,
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way">A.A. is the only way</a>&quot;
(in spite of Bill Wilson's two-faced claims that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way">A.A. wasn't the only way</a>).
<p>
Bill's &quot;hard drinker&quot; versus &quot;real alcoholic&quot; is what you call
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy">a false dichotomy</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may have the habit badly
enough to gradually impair him physically and mentally. It may cause him
to die a few years before his time. If a sufficiently strong reason &#8212; ill
health, falling in love, change of environment, or the warning of a doctor &#8212;
becomes operative, this man can also stop or moderate, although he may
find it difficult and troublesome and may even need medical attention.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But what about the real alcoholic? He may start off as a moderate drinker;
he may or may not become a continuous hard drinker; but at some stage
of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor
consumption, once he starts to drink.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 20-21.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So Bill is saying that if a hard drinker just drinks a little more,
then he crosses some imaginary line and becomes a real alcoholic.
The &quot;hard-drinker/alcoholic&quot; distinction is arbitrary and artificial.
It is obviously all just a matter of degrees.
Even Bill says that, even he tries to semantically tap-dance his way into saying that
hard drinkers are different people than alcoholics.
<p>
My take on the word &quot;alcoholic&quot; is very simple:
<b>If you are habitually drinking enough
alcohol to wreck your health,
then you are an alcoholic.</b><br>
What Bill Wilson described as a &quot;hard drinker&quot; in
the first paragraph,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;He may have the habit badly enough to gradually impair him physically
and mentally.&quot;</font>,
qualifies as an alcoholic in my book.
</font>

<p>
More importantly, even if Bush did drink alcoholically, his testimony
about how he recovered does not contradict the A.A. program.  Page 45 of
the Big Book summarizes the A.A. program of recovery:  &quot;Lack of power,
that was our dilemma.  We had to find a power by which we could live,
and it had to be a Power greater than ourselves.  Obviously.  But where
and how were we to find this Power?  Well, that's exactly what this book
is about.  Its main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than
yourself which will solve your problem&quot; (emphasis omitted).  President
Bush claims that praying for help from his Higher Power relieved his
drinking.  I fail to see how his experience differs significantly from
A.A.'s broad spiritual purpose.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh neat! You are now declaring that A.A. meetings are superfluous and a waste of
time.
Alcoholics Anonymous is totally irrelevant and unnecessary.
Just say one prayer invoking the name of Jesus and you are cured of alcoholism.
No need for A.A. at all! That's the best news I've heard all week!
</font>
<p>

You also call A.A. &quot;bad religion.&quot;  You then provide a link to a long,
seemingly stream-of-consciousness tract alleging A.A.'s &quot;heresies.&quot;
Alas, I could only bring myself to read a small portion of this, but
there was plenty in the passages I read to pique my curiosity.  You seem
scandalized by A.A.'s spiritual tenets from a Christian perspective, but
pay lip service to the notion that Buddhists, Hindus, and Native
Americans, among others, would find A.A. as heretical as, say, the
Catholic Church would.  I wasn't aware that the former faiths identified
A.A.'s principles (or anything else, for that matter) as &quot;heresies.&quot;  I
challenge you to produce evidence of this.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well since you couldn't bring yourself to actually read the file, I won't
bring myself to actually respond to your nonsense.
<p>
I'll just point you to one specific item: Did you read the question about
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Devil">selling
your soul to the Devil in trade for sobriety</a>? What do you think about a deal like
that? How does it differ from surrendering your soul to Alcoholics Anonymous
in trade for sobriety, and learning to
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">lie to the newcomers</a>
and
<a href="orange-recruit.html#arousing_prejudice">hide the true
nature of A.A. from the pigeons and babies</a>?
<p>
Oh, and if &quot;G.O.D.&quot; can be a &quot;Group Of Drunks&quot;,
why can't &quot;G.O.D.&quot; be a &quot;Group Of Devils&quot;?
</font>
<p>
Furthermore, you condemn A.A.'s pantheistic &quot;God as you understand him&quot;
concept as &quot;deceptive double-talk,&quot; because it marginalizes atheists.
How is A.A.'s palatability to atheists relevant to whether or not the
program constitutes &quot;bad religion.&quot;  Under that rubric, any spiritual
program (with your hallowed Catholic Church at the top of the list)
would qualify as &quot;bad religion.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong. You really are twisting things. I said that it was double-talk because
you can allegedly have any &quot;God as you understand Him&quot;,
and then you can't. It has to be
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle">the miracles-on-demand
wish-granting order-dictating A.A. version of god</a>,
or else the 12 Steps won't work.
<p>
That is
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater">a bait-and-switch trick</a>.
And that is dishonest and deceptive.
</font>
<p>

Lastly, what is the significance of Al-Anon?  Or Cocaine Anonymous?  Are
these A.A.?  To assail A.A. as &quot;bad religion&quot; via such proxy attacks is
no more logical than to condemn the Catholic Church for the shortcomings
of Anglican or Protestant orders.

<p>
<font color="blue">
All of those organizations are part of the 12-Step cult, and they all push the same
12-Step religion as the answer to all of your problems.
Your attempt to claim that they have nothing to do with A.A. is disingenuous and
as phony as a 3-dollar bill.
</font>
<p>

You claim that &quot;A.A. refuses to allow any research into treatments for
alcoholism&quot;.&quot;  What does this statement mean?

<p>
<font color="blue">
It means that A.A. members who have worked themselves into positions of
influence and power in government and state agencies refuse to allow any
research into treatments for alcoholism that might supplant Alcoholics
Anonymous, or show just how ineffective A.A. really is.
<p>
It means that A.A. members raise unholy hell whenever someone gores their ox by
revealing that A.A. does not work.<br>
<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_threats4criticizing">
People have been fired, and worse, for questioning or
criticizing Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
<p>
It means that A.A. members scream and cry and make a big fuss whenever
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Rand_1739">someone issues a report that
contradicts favorite A.A. superstitions</a>.
</font>
<p>

More perplexingly, you claim that &quot;A.A. illegally and immorally coerces
people into joining the A.A. religion.&quot;  You substantiate this claim
with reference to material from Hazelden, an organization which A.A. has
never and will never recognize as authoritative on recovery or A.A.
matters.  Your subsequent attempt to connect Hazelden's policies to
those of A.A. is deceptive.  What in your excerpt from _Pass It On_
suggests illegal coercion?  What coercive legal authority do doctors,
hospitals, or ministers hold over their charges?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are trying to weasle out of it by claiming that Hazelden has nothing
to do with Alcoholics Anonymous. Get real. Who do you think you are fooling?
You aren't dealing with ignorant babies and pigeons here.
<p>
Hazelden is the single biggest front group and promoter for A.A. that there is in this world.
Hazelden is the largest <i>Big Book</i> reseller and the biggest A.A. proselytizer
that there is.
<p>
Hazelden even writes manuals on how to be a good proselytizing A.A. member, like the
&quot;<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Little_Red_Book">Little Red Book of Hazelden</a>&quot;.
Hazelden and A.A. are very much in bed together.

<p>
And your attempt to claim that A.A. is innocent
of coercive recruiting is so grossly dishonest that all I can do is refer you to
page 58 of the <i>Big Book</i> where Bill Wilson yammered about A.A. being a lifestyle
of rigorous honesty.
</font>

<p>
Your citation to federal judicial precedent is similarly confused.  All
that these cases establish is that it is illegal for the state to compel
someone to attend A.A. meetings.  No serious A.A. member would dispute
the validity and wisdom of these decisions.  A.A., after all, is not for
those who need it ? only for those who want it.  Compulsory attendance
violates the spirit of A.A.  In Chapter Seven, &quot;Working with Others,&quot;
the Big Book advises, &quot;If [a prospective member] does not want to stop
drinking, don't waste time trying to persuade him&quot;  If he does not want
to see you, never force yourself upon him&quot;  And be careful not to brand
him as an alcoholic.  Let him draw his own conclusion&quot;  We find it a
waste of time to keep chasing a man who cannot or will not work with
you&quot; (pages 90-96).

<p>
<font color="blue">

Again, the whole issue of
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">coercive recruiting</a>
shows the two-faced nature of Alcoholics
Anonymous. A.A. routinely uses every means at its disposal to force people into
A.A. meetings,
everything from court-ordered attendance to treatment center referrals,
and then A.A. lies and says that it isn't doing it at all, and A.A. really believes
in freedom, etc... What a load of bull droppings.

</font>
<p>

I would be much obliged if you could offer a response to my concerns.

<p>

Thank you for your study,

<p>

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>

Thank you for your timely and informative reply to my email.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Jon. You are welcome.
</font>
<p>

You seem
resolute in your belief that A.A. is a nefarious design, so I won&quot;t
waste either of our time trying to convince you otherwise, or
challenging you to prove this charge in any meaningful sense.  One issue
that I believe is essential to follow up on is your personal definition
of the term &quot;alcoholic.&quot;  In your reply to my email, you say that anyone
who &quot;habitually drink[s] enough alcohol to wreck [his or her] health&quot; is
an alcoholic.  You then reject the viability of an entire program of
recovery because you argue that an alcoholic, as you choose to define
it, can stop drinking without abandoning himself to God, admitting his
faults to God and to his fellows, clearing away the wreckage of his
past, and giving freely of what he finds and joining other alcoholics
(this is the program that A.A. offers, as the final paragraph of our
basic text, p. 164 of the Big Book, summarizes it).

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, wrong, totally wrong. I do not
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;reject the viability of an entire program of
recovery because [I] argue that an alcoholic, as [I] choose to define
it, can stop drinking...&quot;
</font>
etc.

<p>
I reject Alcoholics Anonymous because
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">it does not work, period</a>.
A.A. has a zero-percent success rate, above
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">normal spontaneous remission</a>.
Alcoholics Anonymous just lies and
fakes the numbers and fools people into thinking that it works.

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is not &quot;a program of recovery&quot;. It is a
lying cult religion. Period.

</font>
<p>
<a name="willpower"> </a>
Let's assume, /arguendo/, that you have taken the correct position in
the controversy over how the term &quot;alcoholic&quot; should be defined.
Imagine, though, if you will, that within the broad definition of
alcoholism that you provide, that there is a certain class of men and
women who cannot stop drinking on willpower alone.  Imagine that these
men and women have tried every method to stop drinking except for the
program of A.A., and that all of these other methods have failed.  Now,
even if you are correct that someone can be an alcoholic without
belonging to this class of hopeless drinkers, it is beyond refutation
that such a class of hopeless drinkers does, in fact, exist.   Your
argument seems to be that one can call himself &quot;an alcoholic,&quot; and still
be able to stop drinking without going to the lengths that the class of
hopeless drinkers I have described above have had to go to recover from
its brand of alcoholism.  I am happier for these drinkers than you could
imagine.  However, there are over 100,000, regularly-meeting groups of
people on this planet that have not been able to stop drinking without
going to the lengths proposed in the Big Book.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Those are bogus terms, just the lies of Bill Wilson:

<ol>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;a certain class of men and women who cannot stop drinking on willpower alone&quot;.
</font>
<p>
Who says that &quot;will power&quot; is the only thing that we have going for us?
<p>
How about the desire to avoid suffering and death?<br>
How about fear of death?<br>
How about the desire to gain self-respect?<br>
How about the desire to keep a job or a marriage together?<br>
How about the desire to regain one's health?
<p>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Imagine that these
men and women have tried every method to stop drinking except for the
program of A.A., and that all of these other methods have failed.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Imagine that this line is just some more of Bill's Bull.
<p>
Almost nobody has tried <i>all</i> of the various sobriety programs.
Two or three is more the usual count.
<p>
And the A.A. recruiters do not ask people whether they have
tried &quot;all&quot; of the other
programs before they start saying that A.A. is the only thing that works.
They start saying that real soon.

<p>
<li> 
<font color="#4f007f">
...it is beyond refutation
that such a class of hopeless drinkers does, in fact, exist.
</font>
<p>
Wrong again. I refute it.
There are many stubborn alcoholics who would rather die than quit drinking,
but they are not &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;. They just do not want to quit drinking.
They would rather die than change their lifestyle.
<p>
Now you and I may consider such a suicidal choice to be insane, but that's just how it is.
<p>
And they aren't alone.
<ul>
<li>
Some girls kill themselves by refusing to eat food, so they can be thin.
<li>
Other people eat themselves into obesity, heart attacks and diabetes.

<li>
Hundreds of thousands of Americans smoke themselves right into painful deaths
from emphysema and lung cancer, every year.
</ul>

None of them are &quot;powerless&quot;, even though they may be really obsessed
with their particular thing.

<p>
Even when somebody cries that he can't quit drinking, like
<a href="orange-jokes.html#Vision">the Bill Dotson story in the <i>Big Book</i></a>,
where Dotson whimpered that he couldn't understand
how he got drunk on the way home from the hospital (when all he did was stop off
at the bar for a few),
that does not mean that somebody is powerless over alcohol. It just means that the
guy wants to drink more than he wants to stay sober, and his thinking isn't clear
about what he really wants.

<p>
<li>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;...there are over 100,000, regularly-meeting groups of
people on this planet that have not been able to stop drinking without
going to the lengths proposed in the Big Book.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is some more of Bill's Bull. Some people quit drinking, and then a slick
fast-talking cult recruiter fools them into believing that they quit because they
did some old cult religion practices that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Bill got from Frank Buchman</a>.
<p>
The fact that somebody didn't quit drinking before does not prove that he <i>could not</i>
quit drinking without doing some cult religion practices.
<p>
In fact, there is no evidence that practicing the 12 Steps causes people to quit drinking
or helps them to quit drinking. The hard evidence says just the opposite.
Check out the studies done by Doctors:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a>, who found
that A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a>, who found
that A.A. increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a>, who found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive,
and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a>,
who found that having a doctor talk to the patient for just one hour was
just as effective as a whole year of A.A.-based treatment.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>
the A.A. Trustee, who found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective,
and raised the death rate in alcoholics.
</ol>
<p>
Cult religion is just not a cure for alcoholism.
</ol>
</font>
<p>

These are people for whom drinking was a fatal malady and a terminal
condition.  This class of hopeless drinkers was no more able to escape
its dependence upon alcohol than it was able to escape its dependence
upon oxygen, until each of them adopted the spiritual program of
recovery outlined in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. This is fiction, just Bill's cult religion propaganda.
</font>
<p>


No matter
what definition of an &quot;alcoholic&quot; you subscribe to, there is no
disputing that there is a class of hopeless drinkers for whom no other
design will ensure freedom from drinking.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, there is disputing it, because it is untrue.
</font>
<p>


This is who A.A. aims to
help.  There are many who fall into this class of hopeless drinkers who
come to A.A. but choose not to practice the spiritual program outlined
in the Big Book.  They invariably drink.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. That is just Bill Wilson's claim that &quot;his alcoholics&quot;
were &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, and they couldn't quit his cult or
they would die.
<p>
And if someone quit drinking without kowtowing to Bill and doing his Steps,
then that guy wasn't &quot;a real alcoholic&quot;.
</font>
<p>

You seem to desperately cling to the label of &quot;alcoholic&quot; you have
applied to yourself.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is more word games. I do not &quot;desperately cling&quot; to a label.
I simply accept the fact that I'm an alcoholic, and I can't drink any more
alcohol or it will kill me.
</font>
<p>

In turn, you seem threatened by the Big Book's use
of this term to define the class of hopeless drinker I have described
above.
<p>
<font color="blue">
More word games and loaded language. I am not &quot;threatened&quot; by Bill's Bull.
</font>
<p>

I fully believe your assertion that you are not a member of the
class of hopeless drinkers who can only recover through A.A.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Right, because there is no such class.
</font>
<p>

However,
the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous limits its application of the term
&quot;alcoholic&quot; to only this class of hopeless drinkers.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That isn't true either.
The <i>Big Book</i> contains a bunch of stories about &quot;high-bottom&quot;
drunks who quit early &#8212; a whole section called &quot;They Quit In Time&quot;.
What, are they not real alcoholics?
The <i>Big Book</i> is loaded with stories from non-alcoholic drinkers?


<p>
And A.A. members don't limit their proselytizing to your imaginary hopeless class.
You and I both know about the teenage kids who get
busted driving home from a party a little buzzed, get nailed by a cop, get
sentenced to A.A. by the judge, and the next thing they know, the proselytizers in A.A.
meetings are telling the kids that they are real alcoholics who have to go
to A.A. meetings and &quot;work the Steps&quot; for the rest of their lives, or else.
Those kids have not tried any other recovery program, never mind failed at all of
them, but they are still getting told that they are hopeless alcoholics because of
one party and one DWI bust.
I know, I've talked to them and heard their stories.

<p>
Only if an old hard-core alcoholic like me quits drinking without
practicing the A.A. cult religion do the A.A. apologists haul out the qualifiers
and start yammering about &quot;not a real alcoholic&quot;.
</font>
<p>


Would it suit you
more if A.A. changed its name to &quot;Hopeless Drinkers Anonymous,&quot; and its
members introduced themselves as &quot;hopeless drinkers&quot; rather than
&quot;alcoholics&quot;&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
What would please me would be if A.A. would start telling the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.
</font>
<p>

It seems to me that, aside from your peculiar allegations that A.A. is a
global conspirator and cult religion, your opposition to A.A. comes down
to the extraordinarily minor point of contention I have elucidated
above, i.e., how one defines what an alcoholic is.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Totally wrong. The immensity &#8212; the collosal sweeping sheer hugeness &#8212;
of your
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="newwin10">minimization
and denial routine</a> is truly breath-taking.<br>
<p>
I complain about everything from coercive recruiting to A.A. lying about their
success rate to foisting heretical cult religion on children, and you try
to claim that it's just a disagreement about the definition of the world &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
That takes some really grand obtuseness.

<p>
Read the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-not_good.html">What's Wrong With A.A.</a>&quot;
for a list of my objections to Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

My hope is that your
documents, which are linked to by Wikipedia entries on alcoholism, do
not confuse the hopeless drinkers who can only save their lives by
abandoning themselves to God, admitting their faults to God and to their
fellows, clearing away the wreckage of their past, and giving freely of
what they find and joining other hopeless drinkers who have done the same.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is my hope that the documents will give people some accurate information,
and help them to avoid being confused by the misinformation of a cult religion.

Your policy of posting emails critical of your site continues to impress
me, and I thank you again for your study of A.A. and the 12 steps.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well thanks. You see, I really do believe in freedom of speech. I believe in
the free market-place of ideas.

<p>
I think it's Hyde Park in London where people take their soap boxes to a
public square, and stand on those boxes and start yelling out their speeches
and harangues to the crowd. And the crowd is free to kibitz and refute, or agree.
It's kind of a spectator sport and a participational sport at the same time.
<p>
In the end, the crowd decides who is a nutcase and who makes sense. Some speakers
get laughed at, and some get elected to Parliament.
<p>
Well I think that the Internet is the new Hyde Park.
I think that the best cure for ignorance and misinformation is more true information.
And I think that everybody deserves his 15 minutes on the soap box.

From:  	&quot;Robert C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Bill Wilson<br>

<p>
You have an interesting website with a lot of good information, but I
think that you have failed to rightly direct your investigation and your
outrage. Bill Wilson is not AA. Much of what you say about Bill Wilson
is true, but his failings as a human being are not a sound basis for
condemning AA. AA is just a book, there is a fellowship that has sprung
up around this book that is supposed to use the book as a guide, but
that does not mean that it does. There are some interesting letters and
articles on your website that shed some light on some of my own
misgivings about Bill Wilson and Dr Bob, for that I thank you. You are
very correct in much of what you say about the fellowship of AA, but the
book and the program are another matter.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello, Robert,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
It is absurd to try to claim that &quot;Bill Wilson is not AA.&quot;<br>
Whose scribblings are read out loud at the start of every A.A. meeting?<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our
path. ...
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Whose 12 Steps hang on the wall?<br>
Whose pictures are on the walls, when there are pictures of people on the walls?
<p>
You may personally choose not to worship Bill Wilson, but lots of A.A. members do.
</font>

<p>
I consider the book to be the authority on AA, not Bill Wilson. Bill
Wilson was the main author, but if you compare the 1st Edition of
Alcoholics Anonymous to his manuscript (which I found through a link on
your website, thank you), there are many changes, most made by the
members of the first 100. I do not believe that Bill Wilson did what is
laid out in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. I think that after the
hospital stay, he tried desperately to explain what had happened, and
wanted it to be the &quot;spiritual awakening&quot; that is referred to in Step
12, a term I believe he got from William James.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is kind of garbled. The <i>Big Book</i> is 
Bill Wilson's manual and bible for Alcoholics Anonymous.
And much of it is
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">the ravings of a lunatic</a>,
like how Bill Wilson confessed all of Lois
Wilson's moral shortcomings for her in the <i>To Wives</i> chapter, while he
pretended to be the wife of an alcoholic &#8212;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We wives found that, like everybody else, we were afflicted with pride,
self-pity, vanity and all the things which go to make up the self-centered
person; and we were not above selfishness or dishonesty. As our husbands
began to apply spiritual principles in their lives, we began to see the
desirability of doing so too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first, some of us did not believe we needed this help.
We thought, on the whole, we were pretty good women, capable of being
nicer if our husbands stopped drinking. But it was a silly idea that we
were too good to need God.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 8, <i>To Wives</i>, page 116.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill's section of the <i>Big Book</i> that teaches us
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Bill_philandering">how to cheat on our wives</a> is
good too...
<p>
And I really like
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears">the part where Bill Wilson raves</a>
that God will make our alcoholism just disappear
without any thought or effort on our part. Does that mean that we don't have to
go to A.A. meetings or work the 12 Steps?

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century
Schoolbook">
We will seldom be interested in liquor. &nbsp; ...<br>
We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given to us
without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes!
That is the miracle of it. &nbsp; ...<br>
We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed.
It does not exist for us.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

I know that Bill Wilson didn't practice what he preached, but that is a different
issue entirely.
</font>
<p>
<a name="compression"> </a>
You probably know who William James is. I think he and his book are the
biggest source of information that Bill Wilson used to write the 12
Steps. William James gave a series of lectures that were put into a book
called &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience,&quot; reference to which is
made twice in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. William James attempted to
analyze and find the common traits from some &quot;religious experiences&quot;
which he considered had sufficient documentation to allow thorough
examination.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Nope, no way. Bill Wilson got almost nothing from <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>,
basically just one slogan:<br>
<center>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;<br>
</font>
(Footnote 1 on page 263 of <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>.)<br>
</center>
And then Bill mistakenly attributed that quote to
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Carl_Jung">Carl Jung</a>.

<p>
The only other thing Bill got from <i>Varieties</i> was the general idea
of people having religious experiences when they are really sick and down and out.
Bill hallucinated that he read the phrase &quot;compression at depth&quot; in that book,
and imagined that stomping on people's egos would give them religious experiences.
But that phrase isn't even in the book.
Bill totally misunderstood the book.
<p>
That mistake is understandable because Bill was in Towns' Hospital, tripping
his brains out on
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">belladonna and other drugs</a>
when he read <i>Varieties</i>.
<p>
Again, the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous is Buchmanism, not anything that came
from William James or Carl Jung.
Bill didn't want people to know that, because Frank Buchman was so unpopular because
of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html">his praise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis</a>.
So Bill made up a fairy tale about how he had
gotten the philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous from Carl Jung and William James.
But there was no truth to it. And later, Bill Wilson admitted the truth:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>


I think his analysis breaks down the &quot;religious experience&quot; into a
definite process with observable results, and that Bill Wilson grasped
that when he read it. I also believe that Bill Wilson realized that
William James was describing what the Oxford Group members had told him
he needed to get. I believe that he set out to &quot;prove&quot; that he had had
the &quot;Spiritual Awakening,&quot; as described by William James by writing the
book that became Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, Bill assumed that his vision or hallucination was a
&quot;<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#spiritual_experience">genuine
religious experience</a>&quot;,
or he put on airs that it was. But again, Bill was sick, detoxing, and
hallucinating when he read &quot;Varieties&quot;, so it is questionable
how much he even saw the pages.
<p>
There is no
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;definite process with observable results&quot;
</font>
that produces religious
experiences or spiritual experiences. That is total B.S. &#8212; just the dogma of
a cult religion. In practice, it is a process of constantly putting people down,
insulting and berating them, and making them feel guilty, inadequate, weak,
and powerless,
which is called &quot;deflating their egos&quot;, which is supposed to
produce wonderful liberating &quot;spiritual experiences&quot;.
<p>
It doesn't work. It is just
a cruel process of hurting people who are already suffering. And to do
that to people who already have mental problems is unforgiveable.
</font>
<p>

Bill Wilson's great failing was not in his research of the spiritual
approach to recovery from alcoholism or in his attempt to communicate
this approach to others through the book Alcoholics Anonymous. His great
failing was that he convinced himself that he had had a &quot;Spiritual
Awakening,&quot; and then set out to prove himself right.

<p>
<font color="blue">
It was pretty inevitable that Bill would imagine that he had had a spiritual
experience. He was tripping his brains out on
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">belladonna and other drugs</a>,
and he had no knowledge of psychedelics or hallucinations.
Bill assumed that his experience was real, and that
<a name="orange-funny_spirituality.html#aacoa_experience">he had seen God</a>.
<p>
And Dr. Silkworth wasn't about to disillusion Bill and send him back to alcohol.
Silkworth said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New CenturySchoolbook">
&quot;Whatever you have got, you had better
hang on to; it is so much better than what you had only an hour ago.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William Wilson, page 13.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

</font>
<p>
The fact that he
failed to employ the solution himself, does not mean the solution
doesn't work.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Solution? What solution?
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
Bill Wilson was just selling Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>,
which is not a solution to alcoholism.
</font>
<p>

Kind of like the saying, &quot;Those who can't do, teach.&quot;
I think that the book makes one point clear, that the solution is
targeted at people with whom all other methods have failed or who have
lost all hope of solving their alcohol problem. This is not for everyone
who ends up in treatment or with a DUI and it is not even for every
alcoholic. The treatment industry, law enforcement and many others,
including Bill Wilson, have done a lot of damage to the ability of AA to
help people by trying to shove this thing down people's throats.
You make a lot of valid points about the fellowship of AA and the way
the program is presented. Thank you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But A.A. does not have a working solution and never did. Having fanatical
proselytizers in treatment centers forcing people into A.A. meetings doesn't
help the situation any, and having the courts sentence people to A.A. meetings
doesn't help the situation any either, because A.A. still does not work and never did work. 
<p>
The idea that A.A. has gone downhill since the golden age because people aren't
working the program correctly any more is just another fairy tale that
is used by the true believers to explain away A.A.'s many failures.

<p>
When Bill Wilson got tired of telling the lie that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">50% of the alcoholics
recovered right away</a>,
Bill clearly declared that A.A. did not work at all:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>

Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There never was an A.A. golden age when &quot;the solution&quot; worked great.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Thank you.

I could just write that and it would probably have more impact than
wrapping this up and putting a bow around it. However, it was your site
that gave me just enough belief that my doubts were founded. It was a
very close run thing, and I am so grateful that you have had the courage
to produce a website acting as a genuine informant to the truth. I
suspect writing the articles has been its own reward, but to publish
them in spite of A.A's insistence that to question the program is
tantamount to murder because any doubt may lead to a drink, and to drink
is to die, is very brave indeed.  Any program that cannot withstand any
scrutiny needs to be scrutinised out of existence in my opinion.

From:  	Amy E.<br>
Subject:  	Thank You!<br>

<p>

I am so glad that someone has finally said what needed to be said.  I
was involved in AA, and NA for several years, having been inducted by an
aunt at the ripe old age of 19, because I was drinking heavily, and
having a lot of emotional problems.
<p>
From that point on, any time that I
tried to say that I might have been mistaken, and that maybe I wasn't an
alcoholic, I was shamed, and humiliated and repeatedly told that I was
&quot;just in denial and was more than welcome to go back out there and
experiment a little more.... just hope you make it back.&quot;

<p>
After years
of involvement I ended up incarcerated for 11 months, in a non- 12 step
treatment program, in the Texas Prison System.  While I was incarcerated
my husband, totally abandoned me and my child, because according to his
sponsor and friends in his AA group, I was a threat to his sobriety, and
he was not &quot;ready&quot; to take care of our child on his own because he was
in early sobriety.

<p>
When I was released in 2002 my husband had been
involved with a woman in his group for several months.  I say several,
but I think he had been back in the program for all of 6 months, and
with her for probably five of that.  (Strange that someone with
supposedly 13 years sobriety would be involved with someone with no more
time than that don't you think?)
<p>
Anyway, when I got back to town I was
treated like a leper because my year of clean time, was not in AA, and I
was not a part of their group, and it was made very clear almost
immediately that I was not welcome there, because it was &quot;her&quot; home group.
<p>
Anyway long story short, my husband, his girlfriend, and &quot;their&quot;
sponsor, (isn't THAT special), practically destroyed my life, but it was
the beginning of the best life I've known ever.  Once I made the
decision that i wanted nothing to do with 12 step, or anyone involved in
it, and got away from all that psychological mind game, I finally was
able to get clean, get on with my life, and now really am a &quot;productive
member of society&quot;.
<p>
Don't you love the way they love to throw that
phrase around, but most of them aren't.  And still isolate themselves
from the rest of society, and basically have done nothing more than
switch one addiction for another?

<p>

Thank you so much for your work!!!!!!!<br>
You are my hero!<br>

From:  	&quot;Steven M C&quot;

<p>

I believe you may have overlooked one significant point and that is that
smoking is not a mood altering habit much like that of consuming
alcohol. No one has ever been arrested for smoking while driving.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Steven,
<p>
I haven't overlooked anything there.
<p>
First off, tobacco most assuredly is a mood-altering drug. Just watch a
smoker having a nicotine fit. Brother will you see some mood changes.
Then give him a cigarette and watch the immense relief.
<p>
It is obvious that smoking does not intoxicate people to the point where
their driving is impaired. So what?
Tobacco still kills 430,000 US citizens per year, and Heaven only knows how
many world-wide.
<p>
But you know what the worst part of tobacco is?<br>
It isn't that it kills you in the end.<br>
It's that it kills you a little every day, and leaves you down
and depressed and low-energy
every day. It slowly poisons you a little bit every day, and generally
messes with your life for 30 to 50 years before it finally kills you.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange
<p>
 
<p>
I imagine AA to be a very dangerous cult. I was associated with it for over 30 years. I imagine, it changes the structure of the brain and one slowly deteriorates into another dimension. The people talk in a monotone and  their feelings are completely non-existent: 'We don't talk about feelings, we're here to get sober'! If one starts to have feelings, one might drink! 
<p>
I was fortunate, because I started seeing a therapist in 1994 and he helped me process my history and deal with the terror, shame and pain from my childhood. Recovery, for me is recovering that 'little boy' who was horrifically abused and process the associated feelings. 
<p>
I haven't had a drink for 21 years. And I imagine if I depended on AA to recover I would end up a 'gibbering lunatic'. I was never insane but I imagine that AA will certainly do the job for you, if you hang around long enough.
<p>
I know a guy who hasn't had a drink for 30 years and I imagine he's quite mad. He cut me off because I said that AA was a cult and that Bill Wilson was a false prophet. We had been friends for 30 years. That's how strong the AA trance can become. His words: 'I don't like people, running down AA! He didn't tell me how he felt, because I imagine he doesn't know. I imagine he's a 'rageaholic' and rages over his fear, pain and shame, which is   exactly what I used to do before I started seeing a therapist.
<p>
I imagine AA is still in the 'dark ages', it's so controlling and I imagine that it doesn't keep people sober. It's O.K. if you want to quit drinking but that's only the tip of the iceberg.
<p>
It's never about anyone else; it's all back there in one's childhood. AA has helped me recover, because it was very much like my history: very controlling and oppressive. I also imagine it to be anti-Christ.
<p>
For me the journey of recovery has brought me to a deeper understanding of what Jesus Christ did for me. I should be in Hell but Jesus died on a Cross for my sins. I called on him a couple of years ago, after years of therapy and he has taken away all the fear and guilt. Jesus has forgiven me my sins. Not a higher power but Jesus Christ the Son of God. I love you so much, Jesus, my Lord and Saviour.
<p>
 I could never forgive myself but Jesus did through his sacrifice, on the Cross.

From:  	Pat M<br>
Subject:  	Follow-up<br>

<p>

Agent Orange,

<p>

I wrote once before about the power that AA has in alcohol treatment and
the court system.  I have a friend who is experiencing the worst case of
that collaboration.  She is forced to go to 3 AA meetings per week, as a
so-called treatment, by the court system for DUI, and attends a weekly
treatment group session with a alcohol and drug treatment provider.  She
went 5 months alcohol free but recently had a relapse and weekend binge
for some reason, sounds like she was just feeling very down and wanted
to feel better.  Somehow her treatment group became aware of this and
now she is being forced or coerced to going to AA every day for some
unspecified period of time.

<p>

What she was told was the relapse was due to her self-pity the group
leader so-called therapist used one of the AA slogans that she was
having a &quot;pity party&quot;.  His solution was more AA is needed and more
&quot;working the steps&quot;.
She was &quot;working the steps&quot; and attending meetings
regularly and apparently it wasn't working, so, the so-called
professional treatment person figured out in his infinite wisdom that
she must need more AA and more &quot;working the steps&quot;.  To me it's a bunch
of hogwash.  Where else do you do more and practice more something that
is not working.  Why is no alternative presented?

<p>

I believe my friend needs some individual counseling that is specific to
her problems and not some one-size-fits-all program of fitting her in
the AA box and then magically all her problems will disappear.  I am
trying to get through to her with some sensible suggestions but she is
in deep now with the AA indoctrination.

<p>

You've obviously studied this issue extensively.  How can I help my
friend and encourage her at this stage.  There should be some reasonable
alternative to AA that the court could accept as a good treatment to
substitute for the obviously failing AA treatment plan.

<p>

This idea that if something isn't working double-up on it and it will
then work is a mistake I'm sure.  The best analogy that comes to mind
for me is:  if 1 x 0 = 0 then doesn't 2 x 0 also = 0 and so on.  Their
approach is if 3 times a week doesn't work, move on to going every day
and I guess if everyday doesn't work you move on to going twice a day
and so on.  I guess eventually you simply live at an AA meeting for the
rest of your life to get the full program or should I say &quot;fool&quot; program.

<p>

Hi Pat,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Yes, there is something that you can do. There are several good alternative
self-help groups, in particular SMART and Women For Sobriety (WFS).
<p>
The court not only &quot;can accept&quot; these alternatives, the court MUST accept them.
Alcoholics Anonymous has been ruled a religious organization. It is against
the law to force people to go to a religious service, which is what A.A. meetings
are.
See
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges">the judges' opinions, here</a>.
<p>
Also see

decisions that declared that A.A. was engaging in religious ceremonies,
and that sentencing someone to go to A.A. meetings was unconstitutional.
<p>
You can object to 12-Step &quot;treatment&quot; programs on the same basis &#8212; it's just
cult religion, not anything based on medicine or science.
See the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</a>&quot;
for the failure rate, which is pretty
much 100% (after you subtract out normal spontaneous remission).


<p>
Another thing I would consider, if you have any contact with clergy, is to take a
copy of the file &quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>&quot;
to your clergyman and ask for
his help in getting your friend out of a bad religious cult.
The judge won't want to be seen forcing someone to go to a certain religion,
especially not over the objections of a clergyman from another religion.

Subject:  	Your Site<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I came across your site by accident. I'm a member of A.A. &#8212; I have been
for 18 years now. I'm not too thrilled with what has been happening
within AA during that time. I think Wally P. has been doing A.A. the
greatest service by resurrecting the methods used in the 1940s and 1950s
which were leading to 50-75 percent recovery rates. He did not pull
these numbers out of thin air. He interviewed about 100 people from that
era and reviewed actual records kept by group secretaries around the
country.

<p>

I'll continue to study your site and may send you questions from time to
time if you do not mind. I'm certainly not here to debate you &#8212; you are
entitled to your opinion. I am a scientist by training, and have
performed a lot of behavioral research &#8212; some successful some not
successful. I, however, have never had a problem with any &quot;god&quot;
concept, even long before I joined  A.A. That is just how I am wired, I
suppose.

<p>

---Joe

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Joe,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
I have huge problems with the fantastically-good numbers that come from way back when.
Just about all of what I have seen is somehow rigged, fixed, faked, or flawed.
<p>
For example, look at the early reports of success from the first Philadelphia
A.A. group, which I reprinted
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Philadelphia" target="newwin2">here</a>.
<p>
First, those authors just assumed that A.A. somehow made people quit drinking
after they had gone to only 2 or 3 A.A. meetings, which is absurd. Why wasn't the
credit for any subsequent sobriety that occurred given to the 
hospitalization and treatment for alcoholism that was done there?
<p>
Then the authors started using qualifiers to rule out the failures &#8212; people
were not considered members until they had been sober in A.A. for 2 months.
That neatly ruled out most all of the failures and chronic relapsers and drop-outs.
Such cherry-picking will easily create a great success rate.
<p>
Heck, you can have a 100% success rate if you don't count any failures because
they &quot;didn't really try&quot; or they &quot;didn't thoroughly follow our path&quot;
or &quot;they didn't keep coming back&quot;.
<p>
But when you are computing the success rate of a medical treatment, you have to
count all of the patients, especially the ones on whom the medicine didn't work.
<p>
That is the single biggest problem I have with all of those reports from the group
secretaries. You have to ask, <i>&quot;Did you count every single
alcoholic who came looking for help to quit drinking,
even the ones who only came once and were disgusted by
what they saw, and never came back?&quot;</i>
<p>
If the answer is &quot;No, we didn't count them.&quot;, then the report is invalid.

<p>
And then the authors of that Philadelphia report
included people who had gotten themselves sober before A.A. was ever started
in Philadelphia, just to improve the numbers a little more.
<p>
Then the authors just threw away the failures whom they didn't wish to talk about.
They just arbitrarily discounted 23 more people for no given reason.
<p>
Then the authors concluded that A.A. worked great.
<p>
No it didn't. Those numbers are as phony as a three-dollar bill.
<p>
Even Bill Wilson himself explained what a huge failure Alcoholics Anonymous was 
back in the early days:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><b>Bill Wilson</b>, at the memorial service for
Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;
file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, Francis Hartigan, Lois Wilson's private secretary, wrote a book
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses" target="newwin3">where he reported</a>
that fully half of the original <i>Big Book</i> authors relapsed
and returned to a life of drinking. And those were the early A.A. old-timers,
not the so-called &quot;one-month wonders&quot;.
<p>
Hartigan says that Bill Wilson kept the first copy of the <i>Big Book</i>
that came off of the printing press, and he ticked off the names of the authors
as they relapsed. Apparently, that book still exists, and is hidden in the
locked A.A. archives so that the public won't learn the truth.
<p>

Now I would like to see those original reports from the group secretaries.
Do you think you can get the real documentation &#8212; full and complete records &#8212;
out of the locked and sealed
Alcoholics Anonymous archives so we can research this subject further?

<p>
Have a good day. Oh and please do continue to read this web site and ask questions.
I am interested in the real truth above all.

Subject:  	My Experiance<br>

<p>

Mr. Orange,

<p>

I went to treatment in 1986 at age 34. It was of course based on AA.
Got out of treatment and did what AA suggested.  Stayed clean and sober
for 14 years.  During this time I never went to the dentist and should
have not waited 14 years.  Had root canal and got prescription for
hydrocodone, hesitated before getting it filled, got it filled and
started taking it.  And of course if one every four hours was good, four
every 1 hr was better.  My relapse had begun.  At the end of 5 years I
was injecting morphine several times daily.  Needless to say all the
predictable consequences of my actions for the last 5 years were coming
to a head.

<p>

Fortunately, my employer forced me to go in treatment for 28 days
January of 2005.  Now clean and sober over a year.  Of course this
treatment was not much different than the one in 1986 (AA/NA)
orientated.  So I was reintroduced to AA for $15,000.

<p>

I have been going to meetings, got a sponsor, reading the book, carrying
the message to a local state pen, but something is different this time.
And please bear with me because of my previous conditioning.  I seem to
have different understandings of the program, I never thought I was
powerless, unless the booze, etc was in me, as long as I don't drink,
alcohol is not a factor!

<p>

Partly due to your information and my life experience I have begun to
think about the nature of things and look for truth.   I have been
reading Emmet Fox's interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount and it
seems that I see parts of the Big Book that are very, very similar to
the wording of the Sermon in the Bible.  I have seen Fox's book on sale
at some AA meetings.  I heard this book was given out to early members
prior to the Big Book, any info on that?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Paul.
<p>
No, I had not heard of that particular factoid before, but I know that Emmett's book was
popular in early A.A. circles. I've seen it mentioned in several places.
<p>
This is one book that supports that idea:<br>
Sikorsky, I. I., Jr. (1990). AA's godparents: Three early influences on
Alcoholics Anonymous and its foundation, Carl Jung, Emmett Fox, Jack
Alexander. Minneapolis, MN: CompCare.

</font>
<p>

I am going to a meeting now and probably disturb one of the King's, as I
call them.  For right now I appreciate the knowledge you have presented
and will continue to explore the truth.

<p>

PS  In 1986 I was told my wife needed to go to Alanon, guess what, she
went to one meeting and told me she did not need it.  Her problem was ME
drunk, and now that I was sober we could get on with our lives.  She
highly resented the Alanon members telling her she was the problem.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No joke. She has good reason to resent it.
</font>
<p>

Funny how some people know from the get go what is truth!!

state at that time. (State of geography, not state of mind.)
<p>
About the roots of N.A.: I've heard some very interesting stories about its
founders, but nothing that I can substantiate yet. That is an area of ongoing study.
<p>
Have a good day.

A. Orange:

<p>

I have been sober for over 12 years now, and in the first 3 years of
that sobriety I was an active member of AA.  So active, in fact, that I
was put in charge of a money-collection function and somehow found
myself helping myself to the till.  At any rate, I was able to repay the
money and return my self-respect, but I never went back to AA until
quite recently

<p>

</font>
<p>

I have found that AA, for all of its proclamations of anonymity and
secrecy, is the biggest bunch of gossips and back-stabbers that I have
ever found.  It was made very clear to me when it was announced that a
member of AA had died, and the question arose as to if &quot;he died sober.&quot;

<p>

<p>

I just wanted to drop you a line to let you know that while I do not
agree with all of your assessments that I agree with the majority, and
that I hope that you continue your work.

One suggestion:  look at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709131802/http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org/" target="newwin5">AA Online</a>
sometime.  If AA had been started
online, it would have never gotten off the ground.  (Not that this would
necessarily be a bad thing.)

Subject:  	I've got an illness<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

Wow! The scales have fallen off my eyes! I've got an illness. It's called
anonymous-ism. Beware of this illness. It is cunning, baffling and powerful.
But, thanks to persons such as yourselves, it is possible to recover from
such an illness provided that one refuses to be duped by such toxic waste.

<p>

Keep up the great work

<p>

Hi Noel Christmas,
<p>
Thanks for the laugh.
<p>
And let me add that the only cure for anonymous-ism is to join
<a href="orange-jokes.html#ungroupism" target="newwin6">my new cult religion</a>.
Only a spiritual cure can conquer such a dreaded spiritual disease.

<p>
And have a good day anyway.
