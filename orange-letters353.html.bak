<p>
Wow. I really would like to see his &quot;research&quot;. The only reliable, accurate way
to establish the A.A. success rate   &#8212;  or the success rate of any medical treatment
or medicine  &#8212;  is with a
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">randomized longitudinal controlled study</a>,
 and I never heard of Dr. Hore doing one.
So what was Dr. Hore &quot;researching&quot;?

<p>
In general, I find that extreme numbers like that are simply made up. Like how
Bill Wilson lied in the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i> and wrote,
<p>
<a name="really_tried"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, Foreword to the Second Edition of the <i>Big Book</i>, 1955, page XX.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, 50 plus 25 is 75, which is close to Dr. Hore's statement.
<p>
Bill Wilson was, of course, lying like a rug, just making up numbers.
And he was lying with qualifiers. Bill only counted those people whom he considered to
have &quot;really tried&quot;.
(There is more about that quote
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#really_tried" target="_blank">here</a>.)
<p>
The next question is motive: Why would Dr. Hore make such groundless statements?
Is he a member of A.A., or a salesman of 12-Step rehab?
<p>
Oh, and did you notice that Dr. Hore was also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">lying with qualifiers</a>?
He said that the A.A. success rate was &quot;as high as 70 per cent&quot;.
As high as? Which means that it could be anything between zero and 70 percent.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Bill W. U.S. Army<br>

<p>
No I am not a spammer. I been catching hell from AAers for years now. Every
dirty trick in the book. I am a U.S. Navy disabled veteran and Bill W.'s
story doesn't ring true. I was eligible for officers candidate school. Bill
flunked out of college yet is portrayed as an officer. Not likely. There
is no mention of his position or duty assignment. Something definitely wrong
here.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Gene,
<p>
Thanks for some healthy skepticism.  In this case though, I think that the basic
facts about Bill's military experience may be true.

<p>
Bill Wilson did not exactly flunk out of Norwich University. He was going to flunk out,
so he went and enlisted in the Army instead.
That was at the end of World War 1, and all
of the nations involved were scraping the bottom of the barrel for more troops.
Most of the good officers and troops had already been wasted. Germany was reduced
to sending teenage boys into combat. France was recruiting more troops for cannon
fodder in her African colonies, offering French citizenship to any black native
who would enlist in the army.
<p>

</font></td></tr>
</table>

Because Bill Wilson was coming from a military school, and he had ROTC training,
he was a good candidate for a quick basic training program and then he was a newly-minted
second lieutenant.
Bill's whole career was: He boarded a troop ship and got sent to England.
He was delayed there for a few months because of an outbreak of the Spanish
Flu, which was a real killer. Then, when Bill's unit was sent to France, his platoon
was given a small French village up in the mountains to guard. Luckily for Bill,
it was far away from the front lines. Two weeks later the war ended.
Bill Wilson never saw combat, and never ducked a single bullet, or fired a shot
at the enemy. His unit hung around that French village for about two more months
after the Armistice, and then they were sent home and discharged. And that was
Bill's whole military career.
<p>
Now here is the punch line to the joke: The highlight of Bill's military career was
when he pulled his pistol out of his holster and pointed it at his own men
and demanded that they obey his orders. No kidding. That was it. What happened was:
when they were on the troop ship, sailing from the USA to Great Britain,
there was a huge bang one night, and everybody feared that they had just been
torpedoed. Troops began to race for the deck. Bill pulled out his pistol and
pointed it at them and demanded that they stay in their bunks.  Eventually,
when the ship didn't fill with water and sink, they found that they had not
been torpedoed after all. It was just the US Navy tossing a depth charge at what
they thought might be a German submarine. The depth charge exploded very close
to Bill's ship. That was the big bang.
<p>
Bill declared that he had maintained his calm disposition when his troops were
panicking, so that showed that &quot;he wasn't yellow after all.&quot;

<p>
There are more descriptions of Bill's experience here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters51.html#war_record" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters51.html#war_record</a>

<p>
My personal take on it is that Wilson was pretty stupid. Yes, he maintained
order, but if the ship had really been torpedoed, then they would need to
get thousands of guys up a narrow ladder fast, before the ship sank.
Torpedoed ships can go down in like two minutes.
Waiting until the water is sloshing around your legs to be sure that the
ship is sinking before you start
sending the troops up the ladder is suicidally stupid
and guarantees that thousands will remain trapped below decks when the ship
goes down.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

Subject:  	What works?<br>

<p>
Hello! I'm about halfway your article about the in effectiveness of traditional
treatment programs. It's nice to see some actual studies and statistics. Not
something you find without digging. Do you have a similar article about what does
work to help a loved one quit drinking?<br>
Thanks!<br>
Susan<br>

Hello Susan,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments. About what works: Unfortunately, properly-done
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">randomized longitudinal controlled studies</a>
are about as rare as hens' teeth,
perhaps because the 12-Step treatment industry has strongly opposed having
any valid testing done (which would reveal that they are just selling quackery).
About the closest that we can get is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma's randomized longitudinal controlled study</a>
that found that A.A. made alcoholics binge drink more than the control group, while Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT) made them binge drink less than the control group.

<p>
It would be nice if the U.S. Government or Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare
would do some good studies, but they have shown no interest in doing proper studies.
The closest we have ever come is
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#MATCH" target="_blank">Project MATCH</a>,
which was worthless because it had no
control group, and it just compared bastardized versions of A.A., CBT and &quot;motivational
therapy&quot;.

<p>
In the mean time, I have my own lists of what works, including my own experiences and
letters from others. They are all linked from here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>
<p>
And of course, when you read the file on <a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>,
you saw
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#NIAAA_NES" target="_blank">
 the information about the NIAAA finding</a>
 that
<font color="black">&quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do
so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab)
programs and AA.&quot;</font>
<p>
So what often works better than anything else is true self-help: just do it yourself.
<p>
Now, about how to help a loved one, I would stress, &quot;Don't be condescending, and don't be
judgemental.&quot; That just drives people away from help.
(That is one of the big mistakes that A.A. makes. Oh sure, they say that
they don't judge, but they do, constantly.
Look
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#your_way" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#unconditionally" target="_blank">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
Remember that there is an underlying reason
why someone drinks too much alcohol. It might be haunting memories of childhood abuse, or
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">damage to the Cerbellar Vermis</a>,
or it might be the pain of ill health (including smoking cigarettes), or 
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">a defective gene that keeps
people from feeling pleasure</a>, or chronic depression, or a bipolar disorder,
but it's something. Finding and dealing with the underlying problem can help a lot.

<p>
So check out that list above for some ideas.

<p>
Have a good day now, and good luck, and thanks for caring.

The oatmeal is for the babies. Something like Quaker Oats or &quot;quick oats&quot;

The rolled oats don't have all of the husks removed, but the oatmeal does.
And the rice is cooked, so that it is soft for their little mouths.

Hello Laura

<p>
First off I am sorry for calling you to crazy. I also thought you gave my email to
orange, I did not know you are orange. Seems you are a celebrity. I do not want to
fight with you are anyone. I hoped only for an open exchange of ideas in a
thoughtful and respectful manor. It seems to me you have your six shooters out and
are firing at all times. You seem to be on a crusade to have your position excepted
at any cost. And isn't there anything else you chat about. The endless bantering
gets tired fast, I'm right your wrong, no your wrong I'm right, Damm. What makes you
so sure of anything? And maybe that is the rub to me. Who knows,, Perhaps the Hindus
are right, and we are a dream coming out of Vishnu's  belle button. At the end of
the day we all get to have an opinion.
<p>
I want you to know I do not cut or paste anything nor do I forward anything. I take
the time to express ideas one letter at a time. I think you are worth it or I would
not be typing right now. I would like to think I am worth it as well.
Now of opinion. Which is what we have been speaking of;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


&quot;You will do me the justice to remember that I have always supported the right of
every man to his (or her) opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine.
He who denies another this right makes a slave of himself to present opinion because
he precludes his self the right of changing it. The most formidable weapon against
error of any kind is reason.  I have never used another and I trust I never will&quot;.<br>

Ubi Dubium Ibi libertas- sapere aude. I trust you know some Latin.
It is ok to have doubt in fact it is a categorical imperative. We dare to learn or
become like the fat man who refuses to look into a mirror least he know the truth.
Budda had a teaching that goes like this, &quot;I looked into the pond and saw myself,
there I was but that is not me&quot;. Seems pretty shallow but it will take you deep if
you meditate on it for a few years. So my point is even when we are willing to look
at ourselves, can we be sure of what we see? Do we really understand the such ness
of things? So I pose to you the question, what if you learned your opinion was not
fact. Hypothetical speaking of course, non monotonic  logic teaches us that since
a=b yesterday it doesn't follow that it will tomorrow. We once thought the earth was
the center of the universe the copernican revolution changed our minds.
<p>
What if we are all bound over to, for and against each other. Did you read Buber? I
hope you have and it is best read very slowly and as often as possible. I try to
achieve the I Thou relationship Buber writes about, the world would be a much better
place if more people read him. At the very least I continue to see things
differently. Also i love Latin as you may have noticed. When ever I think I may have
had an original thought, I find the Greeks have a word for it.
Obscuris Vera involvens. ---Sta4nce---Just a fun rebus for you. Do you get it?

<p>
Hope you enjoy this 5th of May, as for us we are heading to Hyde park to enjoy this
beautiful day.

<p>
I don't &quot;have my six-shooters out and firing at all times.&quot; I do, however, strongly object when
people say things that just are not true, especially when people's health and lives
are on the line.  And it is A.A. that is on a crusade to have their
position accepted at all costs. They use everything from rehab centers to courtrooms to force
their religion on unwilling victims. They even kill people by telling them not to take their
medications and just trust the 12 Steps to heal them. That is a very high cost to continue
fanatical belief in a cult religion.  And unfortunately, the cost is paid by other people &#8212;
people who innocently believed that they were joining a &quot;self-help&quot; organization.

<p>
As far as, &quot;And isn't there anything else you chat about&quot;, that isn't true either. I actually
get the occasional complaint about too much wildlife and too many baby geese.
And going off topic.
Still, the purpose of this web site is to talk about A.A., and addictions and recovery, so
of course that's what I talk about the most.

It isn't a matter of your opinion versus my opinion. Whether somebody is dead isn't just

And if this life is just a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago, why can't we dream that
we can drink unlimited quantities of alcohol and stay high as a kite all of the time, and
still be happy and healthy and holy? Why does the dream turn into a nightmare when we drink too much
alcohol?

<p>
Your Latin,
<font color="black">&quot;Ubi Dubium Ibi libertas- sapere aude.&quot;</font>, says,
&quot;Where there is doubt there is freedom-minded endeavor.&quot; Of course, it is about doubting the
absolute authority and unquestionable &quot;truths&quot; of the Church, and thinking for yourself.
I agree.
And I also doubt the religious beliefs of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
The rest of the philosophical argument really does not have anything to do with the fact that
A.A. fails to cure alcoholics and lies about it.

And yes, I also go to the park, very often, and feed the geese and cute little goslings.

Hi Orange

<p>
Thanks for the site.  A fantastic resource.

<p>
I'm not sure if you are aware and i have not seen it mentioned on your site, there
is a site called www.xa-speakers.org which posts many XA speaker tapes including
Clancy's.

<p>
Also, if you are interested, I have a copy of 'Back to Basics' by Wally P, which I
am happy to send you.

<p>
Regarding Mickey Bush, his thing is acronyms.  He likes to collect acronyms e.g.
<b>FEAR = fuck everything and run</b>, ad nauseum and to name drop every celeb he has come
across in the fellowship.

Hello Norman,

Thanks for the opinions. Alas, you have a much more generous spirit than I do.
I cannot picture Henry Ford in Heaven happily hanging out with the Jews.

<p>
And I cannot regard Israel as a light unto the nations, not with the way that they are
treating the Palestinian people in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Even blocking medical and
food shipments? Heartless. Israeli soldiers shooting people with impunity and breaking
childrens' arms with rocks? It reminds me of the Warsaw Ghetto.
<p>
If we want a country that is really a light unto the nations, I think we have to pick a small
European nation, maybe Denmark or Switzerland, or the Netherlands or Sweden or Norway,
people who never started a war and who have maintained a nice stable constitutional democracy
for centuries, and who take good care of all of their people, especially the old and the sick
and the poor. (Which of course includes universal health care.)

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
You have done a magnificent job articulating the horse shit that comes from AA. In
January-March 2012, I was confined to an AA themed rehab at the behest of the State
of NH. I am currently in discussions with an attorney regarding the filing of a
lawsuit against the institution (Farnum Center) and the State of New Hampshire.
Incredibly, the counselor to whom I was assigned, turns out to have fraudulently
 misrepresented herself as an LADC both in signed documents and on her office door!
Curiously, she is no longer employed by Farnum. I cannot wait to depose that Nazi
Nurse Ratched emulating bitch! This is a narrative of my time with these lovely
folks. Wonder if you have any thought? Seems to me, that AA keeps the income stream
up, in part, through court ordered forced participation. In this case, the state
pays for some of the beds at Farnum. Seems an obvious violation of the
establishment clause, both in forced participation and partial state funding of the
place. I would be keenly interested in any thoughts that you might have.

Hello Jeff,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. And good luck with your lawsuit. I hope a lot of people sue
the 12-Step racket right out of business.

<p>
There is no doubt that A.A. is keeping up their membership numbers by coerced
recruiting.  Even their own literature verifies that.  Two of the recent triennial
surveys asked questions about how people got &quot;introduced&quot; to A.A., and the possible
answers included coercion by courts, prisons, parole officers, doctors and
health care workers, employers (&quot;EAP&quot; = &quot;Employee
Assistance Program&quot;), and family members blackmailing people.
The results were that almost two-thirds of the new A.A. members were forced into
A.A. by somebody, somehow.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a program of attraction; they hypocritically lie.
A.A. is a program of steel-fisted coercion.

<p>
You can see the details and the evidence here:
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">
The  centerfold of the November 2002 issue of the <i>AA Grapevine</i></a>.

<p>
A.A. has since stopped asking those questions.
They stopped asking questions in the triennial surveys about
months of attendance after Charles Bufe pointed out that the
triennial surveys
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#triennial_survey" target="_blank">revealed a horrendous
dropout rate, like 95%</a>.
And they stopped asking about coercive recruiting after I printed those results on
my web site. (Just a coincidence?)

<p>
The new triennial surveys are very sanitized, and reveal very little.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	AA criticisms<br>

<p>
Thank you for your criticisms.  I was fine my first couple weeks in AA actually.
Then the obsession set in.

<p>
I suppose If a man didn't have to drive or operate heavy machinery my life would
have been okay.  I can thank mothers against drunk drivers for my recovery if it
makes you happy.  They tried to bust me a couple times after I got sober.  I guess
it is just the law of averages.  You get a couple DUI's on your record and your
screwed.  I do fairly well going thru road blocks,  its just when I bring drunk
people home from the bar and they try to give my passenger the keys.  Now I say I am
the designated driver and I would not recommend that if you like your job.... You
heard me the alcohol isn't coming from my breath!  When I blow a zero your ass is
going to be in a sling.  You make about as much sense as the cops that pull me over,
just because its two in the morning and they see me pulling out of a bar.

<p>
Nonsense.   Don't shoot the messenger.  If people go to an AA meeting they don't
have to go back.
I could have quit going years ago.  I don't believe the instinct theory.  Not sure
if there is a God.  Don't need politics in my life or the war on drugs. Going to AA;
Church dinners and things like that are one of the few things in life that are free.
A person can not put a price on Acceptance. There are a lot of jackasses in the
rooms. I'm sorry you met them all.  The program is anonymous.  I don't want to hear
what they think about me either. God bless them if they stumble in and say, &quot;IF you
had a wife like mine you'd drink too!&quot;  I never could keep a wife.

<p>
I'm still screwed up. Finished school for nothing. MY life never amounted to
anything and I'm useless and can't hold down a job, but you know what guy?  I can't
afford a drink and I don't worry about where my next one is coming from today.  I
bookmarked your web sight so I can show it to all my AA friends. I am going to show
it to all my friends that still drink too.  AA is not a country club.  I would get
filthy ass drunk if I didn't have to drive myself down there.  They should pay you
to drink the coffee. You will grow hair on your balls. It makes you go bald and your
hair falls out too.  Look around the room!

<p>
Bill and Bob were crazy.  Its like that old Abbott and Costello joke about the two
china men... Now look.  There are a couple days once in awhile I wish I died instead
of quitting with the alcohol.  Desire and passion go hand in hand.  In AA we don't
teach the facts about addiction, give therapy or hand out advise.  We just talk a
little about what we are doing with ourselves, our hopes and dreams. We go home and
put our head on the pillow sober, and get up and ask God for help.... if you have
to.

<p>
Dude, really. Fuck the mumbo jumbo.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Andre,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you chose to quit drinking.
You will be much healthier. Sorry to hear about your employment difficulties.

<p>
Alas, I see that you are minimizing the bad side of Alcoholics Anonymous.
You think that A.A. is just some people getting together and trading bad drinking stories?
There is much more to it than that. A.A. is a coercive cult religion.
<a href="orange-letters353.html#Jeff_F" target="_blank">The previous letter is from a guy</a>
 who
was forced by a court into a 12-Step rehab facility where his counselor was a fake
without a degree or credentials. There is a lot of that going on. My own &quot;counselor&quot;
at &quot;treatment&quot; was
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno" target="_blank">a coke-snorting child-raping Internet child pornographer</a>.

<p>
And those 12 Steps that are recited out loud at the start of each meeting are actually
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
the practices of a nasty old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>,
not a &quot;spiritual program&quot;.
<p>
Above all, we have to ask what are the actual results of participation in the A.A. program?
If it were just people trading crazy drunkalogues then it shouldn't be very harmful, should it?
But I have a lot of A.A. horror stories of suffering and death caused by crazy dogmatic
sponsors who tell people not to take their medications and just trust the 12 Steps to
heal them.  And sponsors who tell people not to go to a doctor or psychiatrist.
And sexual exploitation of newcomers by the old-timers.
And the results are increased binge drinking and increased suicides and an increased death rate.

Subject:  	Thank you.<br>

<p>
Hello there!
<p>
Thank you so very much for all of your writings about what is wrong with A.A.
I discovered your site a couple of days ago while looking for info regarding cults.
I gave A.A. the old college try, truthfully, and as openly as possible.  The total
meetings I attended through the years must number in the hundreds.
<p>
I never felt right about the program.  The god thing in a supposedly non-religious
program was the hugest block.  The powerlessness thing was a huge problem.  Their
simplistic bumper-sticker slogans were always irritating.  Supposedly long-term
sober people in middle-age having to ask their sponsor for permission on every life
decision was a problem.  The repeated urging for me to deny my feelings of anger was
just wrong.  I could go on and on.
<p>
Your writings have helped validate my experience.  More importantly, your words and
all of the work you have put into your pieces have helped give me the language with
which to express my experience with the cult that is A.A.
<p>
A.A. doesn't work!  And to think that it has been institutionalized by our legal
system and health care industry is simply a travesty.
<p>
I will be reading your work as much as possible over the next several days and may
perhaps correspond again.
<p>
My sincerest gratitude for you, the work you have done with the Orange Papers, and
for sharing your story and life with the world.  You are doing good work.

The Blackbird clearly shows what he thinks about &quot;Don't feed the wildlife&quot; signs.
But then again, a Blackbird isn't a duck or a goose, is it?
<p>
Also notice how the birds shit on the sign.

Okay Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the tip.
I'll publicize it. Alas, I'm far away from Toronto, and won't be attending. But
the people here can visit you on the Internet.
<p>
Have a good day now.

One day you shall learn that the imperfect Israel is not what you have been
programed to &quot;know&quot;.   In Heaven or your next life you shall learn, and you
shall be a benefactor of the Jews who are imperfectly protecting themselves
against annhilation.    We must protect those who are in the highest
numbers suffering; those in Syria,.  Not one Pal child was ever hurt
intentionally, buit hurt by the Pal fighters who se the Pal civilian areas
as war launching zones.
<p>
I would rather, and do, support an imperfect Israel who make mistakes, than
any other people or nation except my birth nation, America. The words in
The Holy Torah are pure truth (often in code), and shall and do inspire
Earth as waters cover the sea

<p>
The Light Unto The Nations is the benefactor to Man, and this is known and
shown.

<p>
I prefer and you will also appreciate that we both take a breather and
learn from the sources which come from intution etc.   I shall visit The
Holy Land  October,  God bless us in our learning and doing of good deeds,

Hello again, Norman,
<p>
So the &quot;real&quot; Israel is a magic land that we won't know until we get to Heaven?
Then by all means, let's send our military aid and foreign aid to that wonderful land
in Heaven, and not to the fake copy on Earth.

<p>
You claim that &quot;Not one Pal child was ever hurt
intentionally&quot;. Sorry, but I saw the videos of Israeli soldiers holding down Palestinian
children and breaking their arms with rocks. It was on the network evening news.
The state of Israel responded by outlawing
news photographers taking pictures of the Israeli soldiers doing that.

<p>
Lastly, you claim that 
&quot;I would rather, and do, support an imperfect Israel who make mistakes, than
any other people or nation except my birth nation, America.&quot; Are you sure that you even support
America?  Isn't there a line in the Bible about &quot;You cannot serve two masters&quot;?
(Ah, but that's in the New Testament, isn't it?)

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

<p>
Who r u and why r u so angry at aa

Hello Alexis,
<p>
Who I am is really impossible to answer. There are hundreds of possible answers to
that question, and none of them is complete or the full truth. I mean, possible answers
range from &quot;I am stardust, dancing on a mudball,&quot; to &quot;I am an immortal awareness,&quot;
to, &quot;I am the universe.&quot;

<p>
But for the sake of simplicity, I'll give you the common consensus definition of identity and
say that I am currently a 66-year old hairy human, and
my birth name was Terrance Hodgins, and I live in rural Oregon west of Portland.
<p>
Here are some previous answers to the &quot;who r u&quot; question:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters26.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">who are you</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters50.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">who are you, again</a> 
<li> <a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="_blank">Who are you?</a> 
<li> <a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>
</ol>

<p>
The reason why I am so angry at Alcoholics Anonymous is because A.A. is a criminal
organization that foists quack medicine and cult religion on sick people and causes
some of them to die, and most of them to suffer more, and lies about all of that.
We were just discussing the harm that A.A. does in a previous letter, here:<br>
