Subject:  	Another study<br>

<p>
Mister T,

<p>
Thank you for all you do.  I can't help but count.  I now count the days since my
last 12-step meeting.  I thought I would have no place to go without the cult but I
have found the &quot;New Beginnings Community Center&quot;  for brain injury rehabilitation.
I volunteer there every day I can.  I will try never to mention my 30+ years in the
cults.  If 12-step cults come up I will point people to your work.  I know you are
extremely busy but if you have not seen this please read

<p>
I knew that it was bullshit as soon as I saw the authors quote Moos four times in a row
at the start of the paper.
When you see a lot of references to Moos and Moos, and Humphreys and Moos, you know that you are
looking at another piece of non-scientific garbage that just intends to fool you into thinking that
the 12-Step cult is good. The Moos and Moos and Humphreys and Moos teams are a bunch of
professional propagandists for the 12-Step treatment racket.
They crank out zillions of papers that try to claim that A.A. did something good, but they never
do proper scientific or medical testing to establish a real cause-and-effect relationship.
They never do a true
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled study</a>
to determine how well A.A. really works.
<p>
I have criticized their fake studies before.
Look <a href="orange-letters30.html#Moos2" target="newwin38">here</a> and
 <a href="orange-letters12.html#Humphreys" target="newwin26">here</a>.

<p>
Another glaring sign of bullshit is the fact that this study had no control group.
There was no group of people who got neither treatment nor A.A., to see how many of
those people quit drinking without the 12-Step superstition.
The lack of a control group means that this is a worthless exercise in number-shuffling
that does not and can not establish whether A.A. makes alcoholics quit drinking.
Likewise, they also cannot establish whether treatment did anything good.
No control group.

<p>
What the authors of this paper were trying to establish was some kind
of correlation between going to treatment and
then going to a lot of A.A. meetings. What a waste of paper and type.
Most &quot;treatment programs&quot; simply
tell people to go to A.A. meetings, so of course people who go to treatment
often then go to a bunch of meetings afterwards, for a while,
until they quit going, which is often pretty soon.
<p>
The authors observed that many people who went to meetings gradually dropped out and quit going.
They divided the people into four groups, depending on how many meetings they went to, and how soon
they quit.
They also distinguished between unbelievers and fervent believers.
And then they tried to draw some conclusions.
<p>
They tried to infer &quot;an association&quot; between going to more A.A. meetings and increased sobriety, but
they didn't really establish any such relationship. All that they really established is that
in all of the groups, people quit going to meetings and resumed drinking,
which shows that treatment has no &quot;holding power&quot;. Meaning, the effects don't last.

<p>
The authors slipped all kinds of invalid assumptions into the paper, like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...it seems reasonable that initially high doses of attendance may sufficiently
inculcate an abstemious lifestyle for some dependent alcoholics. It
appears that the high AA group had correctly judged their need for heavy
meeting attendance and activities early on, which is why their meeting
attendance did not decline steeply (as it did for the descending AA group).
This phenomenon may help to engender (and explain) the view heard frequently
among AA members that decreasing one's meeting attendance can be dangerous,
even for &quot;old-timers&quot; with a number of years of abstinence &quot;under their belt.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The authors assumed that A.A. meetings &quot;inculcated an abstemious lifestyle&quot;, totally ignoring the
fact that people really learn from bad experiences like getting so sick from alcohol that they need 
hospitalization or detoxing. That is what gets people to quit drinking.
Then the authors assumed that alcoholics had a &quot;need for heavy
meeting attendance and activities&quot;, which is an A.A. belief that is completely unsupported by any 
facts. The truth is that A.A. meetings do not make alcoholics quit drinking or keep them sober.
Then the authors parrotted
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">the standard cultish phobia induction</a>
that declares that you will die if you leave the cult, or even just cut down on meeting attendance.
Yes, this paper is propaganda.

<p>
And in the end, it all meant nothing.
The authors established no cause-and-effect relationship between either treatment or meeting attendance and
sobriety, or between treatment and meeting attendance.
The authors even said so at the end of the paper:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Most importantly, we cannot draw conclusions regarding causation.
<br>
...
<br>
In summary, these results suggest four distinct and robust patterns of AA attendance over time
&#8212; low, medium, initially high with steep decline, and initially high with gradual decline &#8212;  with little evidence of a strong relationship between treatment exposure and patterns of AA attendance.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;...little evidence of a strong relationship...&quot; 
So this is much ado about nothing, and it means nothing, other than the fact that sending people to
treatment doesn't make them go to A.A. meetings for very long.
But we already knew that just from looking at the dropout rate at A.A. meetings.
The alcoholics go to treatment, and then they go to A.A., and then they go to the bar.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Clicks on the &quot;New Forum topics&quot; are redirecting to some &quot;error&quot; page written in

Yes, there are two things going on there. First, for some odd reason,
if you click on some links on the left margin when you first get into
the forum, you get a &quot;404 Page not found&quot; error message. That is just
a bug in the Drupal system. If you click on &quot;Forums&quot; on the left, then
the same links on the left will work from the following page.

I guess speaking German allows you to translate into English all of the
primary-source, outright NAZI connections Buchman had with the Third Reich! ;)
<p>
 What
the hell is the &quot;Drupal&quot; system? The source that runs the forum's web-site?

<p>

<font color="blue">


Yes on translating the Buchman stuff, although I don't have nearly enough
of the original documents. I sure would love it if somebody in Germany
raided the archives.

<p>
Drupal is the name of the forum software. Look at<br>

Oh yeh, huge archives. In the mid-nineteen-fifties, the Allies turned
all of their captured archives over to the new German government,
which sealed the archives for 50 years. Well 50 years ended just
a few years ago, so now common folk like you or I can go to Germany
and poke through the archives, and actually see the original documents.

Hello Cynthia,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. There is no organization. It's just me, Terrance Hodgins, one person in
Forest Grove, Oregon, collecting information and writing and maintaining a web site. Although I do
have friends who send me findings from time to time.
<p>
The sources of information about the A.A. failure rate are all listed in the file

Each item of information includes the sources, like the medical report or book that describes the
test or program.
<p>
There is
just one exception: A friend sent me a bunch of information that he had about the sales of
sobriety coins in a large area of Texas, and that gave me one more way to see the A.A. dropout rate.

are.  You're a university level teacher, apparently, so there's no reason for any
mystery that I can see.  Or at least, that's my hope...<br>

Hello Alohalani,
<p>
Thanks for the question. There is no big mystery. I broke my anonymity years ago.
My name is Terrance Hodgins and I live in Forest Grove, Oregon.
<p>
The reason for the anonymity in the first place was because I was in the odd situation of living
in housing that was owned by the same corporation as ran a fraudulent &quot;treatment center&quot; that
gave me
<a href="orange-intro.html#porn" target="_blank">a cocaine-snorting Internet-child-pornographer child rapist as a sobriety counselor</a>.
I didn't want to end up homeless for telling the truth and challenging the expensive hoax that is
called &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>
But things have changed, and I am living in a much better place now, and they cannot retaliate
for me telling the truth. I continue to use the Orange name because it has been my pen name for so
many years that it's an old habit, and many people know me by no other name.

<p>
I am not connected to academia, although I like to joke that I have a Ph.D. from the School of Hard Knox.
I dropped out of Berkeley in 1966 at the height of the psychedelic revolution. (And yes, I inhaled.)

<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;John J.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Website<br>

<p>
I just stumbled on your website and I'm really perplexed as to what I should make of
it.  I'm having trouble deciding whether you are legitimately concerned about AA
being a cult, whether you are just a disgruntled malice filled person who wants to
try and ruin a chance of recovery for a questioning alcoholic  or whether you have
some other program of recovery you are involved in that you are trying to promote by
bashing AA.  After all you do seek to be quite fond of SMART.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
It is very simple: I am opposed to foisting quack medicine and cult religion on sick people and
lying to them about how well it works.
</font>
<p>
I don't want to argue whether AA meets some Webster definition of a cult or not,
what I'm utterly surprised at is how you figure AA does more harm than good and
therefore you should create a website and spend countless hours trying to refute it
in your articles?  How can you say AA is harmful and only 5% if people stay sober,
when you can go to any city in the civilized and find thousands in each city that
have years and decades of sobriety and are living proof that they were once hopeless
drunks and AA has impacted their life positively?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Apparently, you have not bothered to read the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
That web page contains the reports from all of the doctors who have done proper tests of A.A's 
effects.
<p>
A.A. does not save 5% of the alcoholics. Five percent per year is the normal rate of spontaneous remission
in alcoholics. A.A. only appears to have a 5% success rate because A.A. steals the credit for
the people who were going to quit drinking anyway.
<p>
The real A.A. recovery rate, above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, is zero.
Cult religion just doesn't work as a cure for addictions.
</font>
<p>
I don't care about what some double blind randomized academic study of AAs success
rates shows.  Everyone know how difficult it is to create a psychological case study
on a group such as AA and get any reliable data.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Bullshit. First, you say that you don't care about the real facts, and then you try to use the
&quot;Everybody Knows&quot; propaganda trick:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody">Everybody's Doing It, Everybody Knows, and Everybody Says</a>.
<p>
And it isn't that hard to do a proper test. 
Look here for a description of a
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="newwin26">randomized longitudinal controlled study</a>.
</font>
<p>

 From my own experience as an AA
member I can testify myself that there can be a revolving door of newcomers and that
success may appear low. But many of those people never really adopt the tenets of
the program and apply it to their lives. Plus if they did, how would this be
measured? Maybe from a standpoint only measuring the people who come to a few
meetings and their success with sobriety, the success rate would appear low. But how
can you honestly say that on balance AA does more harm than good? If that was the
case AA wouldn't exist! 76 years and growing strong!

<p>
<font color="blue">
On the contrary, cults do exist in spite of being harmful.
Scientology is doing just fine, and it is possibly even a worse fraud than A.A.,
although not quite as successful as A.A. But nearly, and it's been &quot;growing strong&quot; since 1950.
And the Jehovah's Witnesses are doing just fine, too, in spite of the world's failure to end in 1975.
They have been around for about a century.
Cults do not just always die out just because they are wrong.
<p>
To claim that the A.A. program doesn't work because the people didn't work the program right is a
dodge. The fact remains that A.A. still doesn't work. A.A. still fails to make the alcoholics quit
drinking. It doesn't really matter what the excuse is, A.A. still doesn't work, and doesn't save
the lives of the alcoholics. A.A. is useless.

<p>
Oh, and A.A. is not &quot;growing strong&quot;, it is shrinking. The membership is in decline.
Subscriptions to <i>The Grapevine</i> are down so far that they are having to lay off employees, and
it may just stop publishing soon. It is losing a lot of money.
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">
The A.A. headquarters is so desperate for money that they commit fraud and perjury and sue A.A. members</a>.


<p>
I can honestly say that A.A. does more harm than good because that is what it does. Heck, even
your own leader,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. and Prof. George E. Vaillant, a member of the A.A. Board of Trustees,
proved with an 8-year-long test that A.A. had a zero-percent cure
rate, and an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate</a>:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.&quot;
<br>
</font>

Trustees, describing the treatment of alcoholism with Alcoholics
Anonymous, in &quot;The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns,

1983, pages 283-286.
</blockquote>


</font>
<p>
And for your extremely negative judgmental portrayal of the cofounders, you should
be ashamed. You mention nothing about the countless hours these men spent trying to
help drunks at no cost to them, about the many acts of service they chose to engage
in. 
 You only mention negative things that are plain rumors and conjecture, and you
present these things so that they should refute any good that these men have done.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. Hours spent foisting cult religion on sick people is nothing to brag about.
<p>
And the reality is: A.A. does NOTHING to be of service to alcoholics. A.A. does not help to
feed the homeless, or run free stores for the homeless, or help the alcoholics in any way.
A.A. just tries to recruit alcoholics into the cult. That is official A.A. policy
that dates all the way back to Bill Wilson, who taught in the <i>Big Book</i>
that A.A. should not be of service to alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic
commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">
The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd &amp; 4th editions, William G. Wilson, <i>Working With Others</i>, page 98.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So don't help the alcoholics, and don't perform any services for them.
Bill says that they must learn to rely on God.
That is pure Buchmanism, and that is disgusting.
The Oxford Group never dispensed any charity, either, and Frank Buchman also taught that
<a href="orange-rroot930.html#Tod_Sloan" target="_blank">his followers should not help
the poor or disabled because that would &quot;make materialists out of them.&quot;</a>
</font>
<p>

You should feel especially bad about where you underhandedly suggest AA founders
were Nazi sympathizers.  Yes Frank Buchman said what he said, and the Oxford group
no longer exists.  AA and the founders never had anything to do with those
statements he made. You are committing intellectual dishonesty sir.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now you are really descending into denial. Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were members of the Oxford
Group while
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Nuremberg" target="_blank">Frank Buchman went to the Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies year after year</a>, and came home from the
1936 Berlin Olympics and declared to a New York daily newspaper,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#interview1" target="_blank">&quot;I thank heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;</a>
Neither Bill Wilson nor Dr. Bob quit the Oxford Group in protest when Frank Buchman praised
Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.  They just kept right on recruiting
more alcoholics for the Oxford Group. They were neither innocent nor ignorant.
<p>
And haven't you noticed the total silence of Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith on the subject of
Hitler and the Nazis? Neither of them opposed the Nazis, or criticized Dr. Frank Buchman for
his involvement with the Nazis, or made any public statement denouncing the Oxford Group's Nazi
sympathizing, or wrote any letter to the editor opposing Nazi sympathizers. Nothing.
The silence is deafening. Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob just kept on recruiting alcoholics for the
Oxford Group.
<p>
Likewise, you will find no criticism of Dr. Frank Buchman's Nazi sympathies in the various histories of A.A.
like <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, or <i>PASS IT ON</i>, or <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>.
They just gloss over the whole thing and pretend that it never happened.


<p>
In fact, Bill Wilson even praised dictatorships himself, and later bragged that
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#Bill_fascist" target="_blank">Alcoholics Anonymous
had &quot;all of the advantages of the modern dictatorship&quot;</a>.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In A.A. there is active still another form of association, a form of which
the world is today in great doubt. It has its virtues, nevertheless,
especially for us of Alcoholics Anonymous: I am speaking of dictatorship.
In A.A. we have two dictators, and we profit and grow through both.
One is John Barleycorn, who is never very far from the elbow of each of us.
The other is the Father of Lights, who presides over all men.
God is saying to us, &quot;Learn my will and do it.&quot; And John Barleycorn is saying
to each of us, &quot;You had better do God's will or I will kill you!&quot;<br>
</font>

</blockquote>
<p>
Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Joseph Stalin had really given
dictatorships a bad name before and during World War Two,
but that didn't stop Bill Wilson from still admiring dictatorships as
a form of government (just as long as he got
to be the dictator). Other people may have had great doubts about the
virtues of dictatorships, but not Bill Wilson. He was keeping the faith,
and making sure that people could continue to &quot;profit and grow&quot;
through dictatorships in Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Then, too we have a dictatorship &#8212; and how! God constantly says to us,
'I trust you will find and do my will.' John Barleycorn, always at our

So we have all the advantages and more, of the modern dictatorship.&quot;<br>

And that line &quot;We are not saints&quot; is used as a cover for everything from theft to rape.

</font>
<p>
You're suggestion that pure unsupported abstinence is more beneficial than AA is
especially weak. The whole philosophy of AA is directed at people who are
unsuccessful at doing this. If alcoholics of this variety could simply stop on their
own unaided willpower AA wouldn't have a need to exist. In every meeting you will
find people who tried the white knuckle method for decades while drifting further
and further into the dark pits of alcoholism. Many who destroy themselves completely
in the process of trying to gain control.

More baloney. Alcoholics can and do stop on their own.

There is a high rate of recovery among alcoholics and addicts,
treated and untreated. According to one estimate, heroin addicts
break the habit in an average of 11 years.
Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was
interviewed, 57% said they simply decided that alcohol was bad
for them. Twenty-nine percent said health problems,
frightening experiences,
accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.

<p>
And the huge glaring fact that you keep trying to ignore is the fact that Frank 
Buchman's cult religion is not a cure or a treatment for alcohol abuse or alcohol addiction.
A.A. does not work. A.A. does not sober up the alcoholics.
You try to explain away A.A.'s failure by claiming that the alcoholics didn't work the program right,
but the fact still remains that A.A. fails to sober up the alcoholics.

Alcoholics do not need A.A. any more than they need an extra hole in their heads.
</font>

<p>
<a name="millions"> </a>
Anyways I'm sure you will respond with some windy well documented argument, but Im
quite certain that it will entirely miss the main point: that AA does work, there
are millions of people and their families who testify to it every day in meetings
all over the world. Are we really just brainwashed?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you are really brainwashed, and no, A.A. does not work. I have not missed the main point, you have.
The point was supposed to be to get the alcoholics to quit drinking. A.A. fails to do that.
A.A. does not work.
A.A. just steals the credit for those few people who quit drinking in the neighborhood of an A.A. meeting
by using their own will power and self-control.
Furthermore, you are determined to avoid learning the truth, which will keep you brainwashed.
<p>
And there are no &quot;millions&quot; of A.A. members, either. The total worldwide membership is under 2 million,
and the majority of them are just newcomers who will drop out soon.
The real hard-core A.A. membership is only a few hundred thousand.
<a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">The rest is just churn</a>.
A.A. is a cult in decline.

<p>
The fact that a bunch of people sit in cult religion meetings and sing the praises of the cult
does not prove that the cult is a good thing.
Think about the Scientologists, and the Moonies, and the Hari Krishnas, and the FLDS... they all
say the same things too. Heck, every cult in the world proclaims itself a great success that is
saving mankind.
And all of those cults have their poster children who deliver testimonials that declare that
the wonderful cult saved them from a life of sin or some such thing.
The A.A. scam isn't even original.
<p>
Lastly, I notice that you unquestioningly accept the statements of some
A.A. members who are not entitled to speak for A.A.
Isn't that what the standard A.A. dogma says? <i>&quot;Nobody is entitled to speak for A.A.&quot;</i>? 
But when people are praising A.A., suddenly they are entitled to speak for A.A. after all, aren't they?
So that is yet another
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#speak" target="_blank">A.A. bait-and-switch trick</a>:
First, nobody is entitled to speak for A.A., and then all kinds of people are entitled to speak for A.A.,
just as long as you like what they say.

<a name="only_way"> </a>
AA does not claim that it is the only successful method for treating alcoholism,
despite what kind of statement you may have heard from some random dude in a meeting

I also described the same thing in the cult characteristic
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank"><i>Insistence that the cult is THE ONLY WAY</i></a>.
<p>
Those web pages list such jewels as:

Popular A.A. slogans say:

The A.A. &quot;<a href="orange-traditions.html" target="newwin29">First Tradition</a>&quot;, which Bill Wilson wrote,

<p>
Well, Bill Wilson says that there just isn't any way for alcoholics to survive other than go to A.A.
No other methods or groups or organizations will save the alcoholics from death.
If A.A. doesn't exist, then most of the alcoholics will surely die.
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">A.A. is the ONLY way</a>.
<p>
There is more, much more. Check out those links.

I'm just glad I've had years of experience in recovery before stumbling on this
filth of a website. I hope your conscience and karma pays you back well for any
opportunities of recovery that you have destroyed for some fragile, scared alcoholic
browsing the web, who could have benefited from AA.

Okay, John,

Enjoy your life in the cult. It's obvious that you don't want to know the truth, and you won't learn anything
because you reject all information that you don't like.
<p>
And I see that you just had to finish your letter
with the standard A.A. complaint that telling the truth about A.A.
will kill some of those poor feeble-minded alcoholics.
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="newwin42">Look here for a long list of such A.A. accusations</a>.
But since A.A. kills more alcoholics than it saves, telling people the truth about A.A. is not
depriving anybody of benefits
&#8212;  other than maybe
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">the money-grubbing perjuring A.A. leaders</a>.
<p>
By the way, you said that A.A. does not claim to be <i>The Only Way</i>. Well then, steering alcoholics
away from A.A. and towards something else shouldn't hurt them at all, should it?
They can just recover some other way that doesn't involve
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the practices of an old
pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties</a>.

<p>
Have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;jane s.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thanks<br>

<p>
Thanks so much for all the information you've gathered here.

<p>
Your site has explained to me the actual TECHNIQUES I fell for which kept me
involved with AA for a short time.  The bait and switch, and blatant dishonesty of
saying 'a god of your understanding' which slowly becomes g.o.d. (no WAY the God of
scripture and an abomination).  I'm in agreement with you that 12 step theology is
incompatible with Christianity.  Aspects bothered me, but I pushed the red flags
aside and tried to reconcile the 12 steps to my faith Christ, under the erroneous
belief that I needed the 12 steps in order to stay sober.  They are irreconcilable.
They are not biblical &#8212; not only not biblical, but anti biblical.  The disease model
of alcoholism is not found in scripture.

<p>
I have not been intoxicated for years.  Total abstinence  was a lifestyle I chose
for myself and achieved on my own.  I realised my drinking was a problem before it
actually became a problem &#8212; just the way I reacted to the alcohol.  I somewhere
picked up the idea that in order to keep the happy sobriety I already had, I needed
AA.  Oops.  I saw the heretical doctrine in AA for myself but you have helped me see
HOW I was sucked in as well as exposing a lot of contradictions and nonsense in the
big book and unknown history of the founders.

<p>
Thanks, again.

Hi Jane,
<p>
You are welcome. Thanks for the letter, and I'm glad to hear that you are free. And sober.
So congratulations on your sobriety, and have a good life now.
<p>
And have a good day too.
