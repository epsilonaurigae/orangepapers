Subject: Success vs. Gloom-and-Doom

<p>

Gentlemen:

<p>

Glenn directed me to you with regard to the posting here:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/AAHistoryLovers/message/2379">
http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/AAHistoryLovers/message/2379</a>

<p>

I've looked this over many times, and looked at the other side as well, and have
come to the conclusion that both sides have misinterpreted the data.  This should
make EVERYONE UN-happy!  (I attach the graph for your convenience.)

<p>

It is correct that the graph does not, as presented, represent drop-out or
retention, though it at first appears to (we KNOW there is a high drop-out rate,
but that is not what the graph represents, based on the language).  The graph
shows a distribution of people &quot;within the first year&quot; broken down by the number
of months they &quot;remained&quot;.

<p>

There is nothing to indicate that those numbers represent sober time, either.  And
certainly nothing to indicate &quot;success&quot;.  The title of the graph is
<b>&quot;% of those coming to AA within the first year that have remained the indicated
number of months&quot;</b>.
And the only conclusions we can draw are those indicated, to
wit, that the percentage of those &quot;within the first year&quot; who had &quot;remained&quot; for
one month is 19%, that the percentage of those &quot;within the first year&quot; who have
&quot;remained&quot; for two months is 13%, and so on.  (Having &quot;remained&quot; for one month,
and having &quot;been sober&quot; for one month, are two different animals and are not
synonymous.)

<p>

The heading of the graph is worded carefully (though it is still oddly unclarified
and strangely misleading to some).  The document is one of AA's own, intended for
internal use.  Had the statisticians meant to indicate sober time, they surely
would have stated that clearly.  They did not.  And unless we get some
documentation showing that they intended differently, we must accept the graph for
only what it is:  a distribution of people &quot;within the first year&quot; who were
present at a meeting during the survey time and who reported that they had
&quot;remained the indicated number of months&quot;.

<p>

I have a serious problem with aa-ny's statistical manipulation as well.  He
arbitrarily  eradicates a full 43% of respondents (all of those who had not
&quot;remained&quot; for over three months, even though these numbers are supplied FOR A
REASON on the AA graph), and an entire one-third of the timeframe (months 0 up to
4).  Can you imagine if the pharmaceutical industry did this with its research???

<p>

aa-ny decides arbitrarily to move the start point to 4 Months (actually, if he
wanted to be accurate with his manipulation, he should have moved it to 3 months,
because the heading indicates that the plot points represent people who have
&quot;remained&quot; to the point indicated, meaning that the plot point shown at Month 1
represents those who had &quot;remained&quot; to that point, and not people who had not yet
been there for a full month.).  THEN aa-ny ADDS A COLUMN TO INDICATE RETENTION,
BUT HE'S ALREADY TOLD US THAT THE GRAPH DOES NOT SHOW RETENTION RATES!  He pulls
some numbers out of a hat, then goes on to show that 56% of people with over three
months stay for a year (again, he needs to move the start point back to the
3-Month plot point instead of 4, which would give us 50%).

<p>

That's bad statistical &quot;analysis&quot; to the point that we can't call it statistics at
all.  It is made-up numbers, with nearly half of the sample thrown out and then
some numbers that didn't previously exist ADDED for no valid reason.  We have
absolutely no idea from the data provided on the graph how many people or what
percentage of people who were recorded at four months were still around at twelve
months. And if we did, why can we not then apply this same formula to those who
were recorded at one month???  And even if we were able to do THAT, it wouldn't
prove &quot;success&quot;, because there is no indication that the people at any point on
the graph was sober.

<p>

aa-ny says that he uses an AA definition of alcoholism, but the closest the book
Alcoholics Anonymous comes to a definition of alcoholism is where we are told that
alcoholism &quot;is an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.&quot;<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://www.bhrm.org/papers/AAand%20DiseaseConcept.pdf">
http://www.bhrm.org/papers/AAand%20DiseaseConcept.pdf</a>

<p>

AA in its preamble says that the only requirement for membership in AA is a desire
to stop drinking.  Period.

<p>

aa-ny is correct that not all people who come to AA are alcoholics (but he is
remiss in not noting that those who are not alcoholics, but who claim to be, are
going to appear to have substantial clean time, which skews the numbers in his
favor, but which, of course, are bogus because those people aren't alcoholic to
begin with!).  But he is incorrect when he concludes that just because a person
doesn't make it to 90 days, he is not an alcoholic.  AA itself says that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;[b]efore
these people came to A.A., most of them had tried to control their drinking on
their own...&quot;<br>
</font>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org/en_information_aa.cfm?PageID=17">
http://www.alcoholics-anonymous.org/en_information_aa.cfm?PageID=17</a><br>

This passage does not mention anything at all about 90 days in the program being
necessary to prove one's alcoholism:  it says clearly that &quot;most of them&quot; who
visited AA had experienced trouble with their drinking.  And of course that is
actually one of the definitions of alcoholism:  having trouble controlling your
drinking.

<p>

ALMOST ALL PEOPLE WHO COME INTO AA HAVE A NOTICEABLE DRINKING PROBLEM AND ADMIT IT
PUBLICLY IN THE ROOMS well before 90 days, and if we are to accept that alcoholism
is only &quot;self-diagnosable&quot; as some insist (it IS medically diagnosable, thank you
very much), and a person admits he is an alcoholic, and he is suffering so much
that he is sitting in an AA room, then we can consider him to be an alcoholic,
whether he makes it to 90 days or not.  To argue otherwise is ludicrous, and goes
against the very grain of AA itself.

<p>

Finally, the numbers are provided by AA itself.  aa-ny has no basis for
eliminating 43% of AA's numbers, and one-third of its timeframe, to suit his own
purposes.  His argument is invalid and misleading.  If he'd wanted to make the
numbers look even better, he could have made the start point the 11-month mark,
and then those who make 11 months have an 83% chance of making 12 months!!

<p>

The graph shows only what it shows, and without supporting documentation (raw
numbers, research methods, how were these surveys conducted?, were they identical
at all five survey years?, what is the margin of error?, were surveys conducted by
professionals?), we cannot derive any more from the numbers than what they are
actually stated to represent.

Hi Scott,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. That's some perceptive analysis.
<p>
I'm happy to report that I had a similar take on the &quot;ny-aa&quot; responses to that famous chart.
(So I'm not upset by the alternate analysis of the numbers.)
My responses are printed
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ny_aa">here</a> and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ny_aa2">here</a>.

<p>
We agree that there is a lot of funny twisting of the numbers going on there.
It is probably true that the chart is simply a one-day snap-shot of the A.A. members
who were in their first year of membership and present on the survey day,
rather than a longitudinal survey that tracked the survival rate of the newcomers.
But, either way, that chart still reveals a huge attrition rate in the A.A. membership.
<p>
I've been looking around and asking around for a mathematical transform that can calculate
the drop-out rate from the data that is
<b>&quot;% of those coming to AA within the first year that have remained
the indicated number of months&quot;</b>, but have had no luck yet.
<p>
It may well be that the number cannot be directly calculated from only that data.
As I stated in
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#holes_in_logic">my second response to ny-aa</a>, 
there is one big hole in the logic:
those people who are remaining might be remaining out of 100 newcomers, or 200, or 50, or anything,
but they don't say what the number is.
The retention rate depends on that missing number.
The best we can do is fudge in the missing information from other sources, like the fact that
everybody from
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Nell_Wing4">Nell Wing</a> to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses">Francis Hartigan</a> to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Prof. George E. Vaillant</a> to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_Australia">A.A. Australia</a>
all reported a 5% recovery or retention rate.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Date:  	Wed, August 16, 2006 2:18 pm<br>
From:  	&quot;Sharen K.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Placebo Effect &amp; AA<br>

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

Regarding any effectiveness that AA might have, two possibilities should be kept in
mind: the placebo effect, and the healthy influences of simply associating with a
group of friendly supportive people.

<p>

Regarding the placebo effect, the following, from <i>Malignant Sadness, the Anatomy of
Depression</i>, by Lewis Wolpert, tells of how effective placebos are even for treating
clinical depression:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

It is essential to recognise the extent to which patients can recover on their own
and it is claimed that 80 per cent of all depressions will eventually undergo
remission without treatment, though this may take a year or longer. The placebo
effect can also be surprisingly powerful; the patient's belief that the treatment
can work even though the 'dummy' medication they are taking contains no active
ingredient, or the very act of talking to a psychiatrist, can, in trial after
trial, give a positive response of around 30 to 40 per cent. The placebo effect as
measured in trials is made up of several elements which are very difficult to
disentangle: natural remission, spontaneous fluctuations and the true placebo
effect. A further complicating factor in these trials is that as many as one third
of those taking part may drop out of the trial, and yet another problem is patient
compliance; they often do not take their medication as directed. One more factor
to be taken into account is the interpretation of the results of the trial,
including an assessment of how well it has been designed; there is a tendency for
those with particular views, say in favour of medication or psychotherapy, to bias
their interpretation in their preferred direction.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

In a review of over 70 studies in 1993 it was found that two thirds of patients
given antidepressant drugs responded, in comparison to one third who responded to
a placebo. That the placebo treatment had so large an effect is in itself
striking, as is the fact that about one third of those in the trial did not
respond at all. Also the criteria for a positive response affect the success of
treatments; if one uses the criterion that there are no depressive symptoms for
two months then the response rate falls to just more than a third.

<p>

Also, even many of those whose responses to the drugs, came mainly from their
physical effects, also had some positive effects from knowing that what they did was
supposed to be effective in helping them.  I'm on a mailing list for those was
different degrees of bipolar disorder.  (Since I don't have destructive symptoms I
don't really have a disorder, but since my basically healthy hyperthymic temperament
puts me in the bipolar spectrum, and I'm quite familiar with all the attributes, I
could contribute to the list.)  Recently on that list was an article which begins:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

TUESDAY, Aug.1 (HealthDay News) &#8212; Factors such as patient beliefs and
expectations, treatment history, and doctor-patient relationships may influence
the success of drug therapy for major depression, a University of California, Los
Angeles study suggests.
<p>
Using electroencephalogram (EEG) measurements, the researchers identified changes
in brain activity among patients during a one-week placebo lead-in phase &#8212; in
which patients take a placebo &#8212; before they actually started taking
antidepressant medication.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>

and goes on to say that those who had those partial responses to the placebo, &quot;were
associated with lower depression scores after eight weeks of antidepressant
treatment.&quot;  The antidepressants are relatively more effective on those who'd shown
a placebo effect to the initial placebos.

<p>

Depression is certainly more determined by biology, than are addictions.  Everyone
knows that addicts do indeed decide to quit after they'd &quot;hit bottom,&quot; but those
with clinical depressions can't choose to stop the depressions.  Therefore, I'd
think that when people go to AA confident that it's an effective treatment for
alcoholism, the placebo effect alone would be even more effective than it is for
depression.

<p>

Also, I've heard that, after a layperson using common sense suggested the idea,
researchers had proven that recovering addicts, by participating in the positive
interactions with others in Twelve-Step group meetings, cause their brain chemicals
involved in feelings of pleasure, to function more normally again.  The drugs had
caused their brains to produce less pleasure-causing chemicals naturally, and the
healthy interactions in the group meetings cause the brains to start producing
normal amounts.  OK, that should mean that the same thing should happen in any group
of people who are supportive of each other.  In an adversarial society such as ours,
it may be difficult to get together a group in which the people take seriously an
obligation to be supportive of each other, but if you get a group like that, it
would have the same naturally positive effect.

<p>

<p>

(Ever since I was a teenager, anyone who didn't have a chronically manic personality
seemed half dead to me, smirk, smirk.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Sharen,
<p>
Thanks for information on the placebo effect. Undoubtedly, a lot of cases of recovery
from alcoholism can be attributed to the placebo effect, and a lot more to normal spontaneous
remission. In fact, those two things explain the <i>entire</i> apparent A.A. success rate.
<p>
And guess what magic number is missing? I have never seen a number for what percentage
of &quot;alcoholics&quot; are actually suffering from depression, and trying to fix their mental disorder
by self-medicating with alcohol. There are undoubtedly a lot of them. Heck, Bill Wilson was
one of them.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Propaganda and Debating Techniques<br>

<p>

I read about 50% of what you've wrote here and it was a good read ...
for a while ...

<p>

I wish you could have been more varied in your examples, the constant
A.A bashing (While I agree with the majority of it) wears thin after a
while. You make it so apparent you have a problem with A.A. that you
almost start to fall into some of the techniques you describe.

<p>

In my opinion, you have two different papers here, but you've combined
them and it makes for somewhat boring reading after so long. There
should probably be on paper on all the reasons you hate A.A. and one
paper describing the various propaganda and debating techniques ... when
you harp on this one group in a paper that isn't &quot;supposed&quot; to be about
them it's obvious you have another agenda (Even if you didn't mean for
it to come out that way).

<p>

I will finish the paper but just from highlighting all the cases of
&quot;A.A.&quot; I know I'm going to have a tough time finishing ...

<p>

Anyway, I figured you could use some feedback from someone who wasn't
just yelling at you for your criticism of the United States government
or A.A.

<p>

Take care,
Cliff B.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Cliff,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
There are actually at least five different books in the web site:
<ol>
<li> Criticism of A.A.
<li> History of Frank Buchman, the Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament, segueing into a history of
Alcoholics Anonymous
<li> The Cult Test and discussion of what constitutes a cult, and analysis of A.A. as a cult
<li> Propaganda and Debating Techniques
<li> A Discussion of alcoholism and drug addiction and recovery techniques
</ol>

<p>
Alas, they are all interlinked and interrelated. One of my big objections to Alcoholics
Anonymous is all of the deceptive propaganda techniques that they use, especially in
their literature. That's what actually got the <i>Propaganda Techniques</i> study started.
So of course many of the examples given there come from Alcoholics Anonymous.
And more come from the Oxford Group.
<p>

I don't think that there is any way to untangle those five books into five separate web sites.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Random thoughts<br>

<p>

Hey Orange: just thinking about this whole disease theory and the
rearrest of Koren Robinson on DUI charges.

<p>

1.  Koren went to a rehab center to get a cure for alcoholism.  Now
that he's relapsed, can he demand a refund?  Oh, wait, that's on him
that he wasn't cured, not the rehab center telling him alcoholism was
a disease, so as our friend in the newsgroups would say, &quot;the spin
(err responsibility) stops there&quot;
<p>
2.  Let's assume alcoholism is a disease, and from the sayings of AA,
we know that you can get &quot;reinfected&quot; if you return to your drinking
places (&quot;wet faces and wet places&quot;).  Now, given that, why do they say
&quot;the newcomer is the most important person&quot;.  Clearly, you're
infecting the &quot;recovering&quot; members with the newcomer who is still
drunk.

<p>

On another note, I'm looking at your site and reformatting it a little
using PHP (non-databases).  Have you thought of organizing it a little
bit differently.  It seems that the letters are overflowing.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You make some good points.
<p>
Yeh, why don't those expensive treatment programs give guarantees and refunds for failure?
(Heck, they don't even give a clear, concise description of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">what you will get for your money</a>.)

<p>
I especially liked the question of
newcomers infecting the old-timers with alcoholism.
I mean really. If associating with drinkers is dangerous for a recovering alcoholic,
then going to an A.A. meeting should be very dangerous. :-)
<p>
Yes, the letters section just gets bigger and bigger. I have no idea what I will do about that.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	peeking into your site<br>

<p>

Dear Agent Orange
<p>
I've only touched the surface of what you've written.
I haven't read enough yet to judge your credibility overall but I plan on reading
more.  Whether I end up agreeing with you in the longrun and about how much remains
to be seen, but I try to have an open mind.  I mean who do I hurt if I don't and
block myself to information that could help me?  Not you.  Those who complain about
you to AOL and Yahoo and those who censor you and try to have you shut down because
they don't like what you say are fools.  That's a part of the Bible I certainly have
to agree with, basically that wise men love knowledge and are open to the truth
while fools shun it.  I especially appreciate this that you wrote about censorship:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;But what kind of a country will we have if no one can say anything that
someone else objects to, even if it is true? What happens to the open forum? What
happens to the free marketplace of ideas? What happens to freedom of speech?
(I never censored my critics. I printed their letters that criticized me, in full,
for all to see.)  What happens to democracy? What kind of a strange, shallow,
styrofoam society will we have if nobody and nothing can ever be &quot;controversial&quot;?&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm not a member of AA but I am of Alanon and I will continue to be unless
and until I think it's in my best interest to back out.  In my 5 months of
attending meetings at the same place once or twice a week, I haven't seen a lot of
the same crap that goes on in AA that a dear friend has shared with me (who told me
of your site) going on in Alanon.  My friend has floored me with information about
the stuff that goes on and I wonder why not near as much of the same has seeped
into Alanon.
<p>
I do have an open mind though and I am looking and listening a
little more closely now.  I don't accept all of its teachings.  I don't have a
sponsor.  I don't believe in telling another person in the program who I don't
really know
about the results of a 4th step, not only because I may not need to hear my voice
say (and thus affirm) certain things out loud but ya just never can tell what might
be too much for another to hear, or what they might get a secret kick out of
hearing.
<p>
A 4th step in itself however has revealed part of myself to me I
might otherwise not have discovered.  Maybe, maybe not.  I have made significant
strides in my life since.  But I also did before so I can't discount that.  What's
Alanon and what's just me and sheer determination and help from God?  I'm looking
into that.
<p>
I did quit smoking pre Alanon, last September.  Didn't have a
support group or work the steps.  Smoked for 34 years then decided last Spring I
wanted to enter 2006 as a non smoker.  And I journaled about it and prayed about it
and tried to rework my faulty programming about it.  Then one day while smoking my
heart went nuts and I threw down the cigarette and declared myself to be a non
smoker.
<p>
And that was that along with 1/2 cigarette more 16 hrs later, more self talk about
being a non smoker, (&quot;Non smokers don't smoke.&quot;) reaffirming my desires in my
journal, and praying through the rough spots.
<p>
I also read a lot of articles that
helped keep me strong early on at a site I reccomend:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://whyquit.com/">
http://whyquit.com/</a>
<p>
There I downloaded this little doodad I can attach to emails or just look at
now and then to remind myself how many &quot;nicotine doses&quot; I've gone without and
how much money I saved.  It gives me these little thrills as I see the #'s
and $'s nearing certain digits.  Certainly alcoholics who need to know
something about the length of time could probably get as much out of
something like that if not more than somebody handing them a chip.  I'm
celebrating 10 months, 3 weeks 3 days and 18 hrs and 17 minutes NICOTINE FREE
btw!   That's abstienence from  9,829 doses of varied poisons and a savings
of  $933.76 !!
<p>
I'll be in touch after I read more.  Thanks for your dedication. Check out my
own site sometime if you'd like (link below).<br>

<p>

I have a drinking problem, i.e. I drink too much.  I've been going to AA for a few
years and can't stand it.  As an atheist Jew, political leftist, the 12 step
philosophy that people have no control over themselves or the world makes me want to
throw up.
<p>
Sitting in meetings with people who &quot;turn themselves over [to] the will of god&quot; while
the world is blowing itself up makes absolutely no logical sense.

From:  	&quot;shon n.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	THANK YOU<br>

<p>

Dear A Orange,
<p>
I had been in AA for twenty seven years, five years intensely
then a non meeting attending member for eighteen then three back to
meetings. I maintained my sobriety and am still grateful that AA was there
but after going back and attending meetings I saw its ineffectiveness.
<p>
I saw
the treatment ghetto AA clubs, the Big Book fanatics, the cultness of it
all, and worse I saw people not being helped. There were many helped but there
were hundreds that were not being well served by its method of spiritual
Ultimatium. The group confessional led to an air of original sinness, Total
Acceptanceness and chronic self hating.
<p>
I had read
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP">
Francis Hartigan's book on
Bill Wilson's infidelity</a>
and how he
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">took the Big Book and made it his own cash cow</a>.
<p>
Your  web site was crucial in my self dePROGRAMMING.
<p>
RATIONAL
RECOVERY IS A GOOD IDEA BUT I DO NOT LIKE ANY THING THAT WILL BECOME A
CULT.

<p>
Mel Gibson will be quite at home in AA but he has too much spiritual
Ultimatumness already as his movies demonstrate quite graphically.
<p>
AA-centered treatment is a scurge on the person who has a problem because they
made a bad decision to take in alcohol.

<p>
Just try to limit your bad
decisions, it is as simple as that.
<p>
AA can ruin your life by making you accept
too much when you should be deciding not to take that first drink. AA is a
waste of time and it is full of spiritual Ultimators who will tell you how
to run your life by telling you not to run your life by letting something
else run it. Confusing isn't it.

<p>
love you A Orange and you have done a good
job .....

<p>
Of course there is  the delima of trying to help those folks who
are making those bad decision to drink and then they end up on Cops.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Shon,

<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
I love to hear from the old-timers who have watched A.A. for a lot
of years.
<p>
Oh, and congratulations on a zillion years of sobriety.

<p>
About Rational Recovery &#8212;
I agree that we should avoid anything that will turn into another cult.
In defense of Jack Trimpey and R.R., I've heard that is why he shut it down.
That is, the people who wanted to quit drinking did, and left the meetings;
while the chronic meeting attenders remained, until R.R. was just filling up
with people who wanted to have another life-long club. So Trimpey disbanded it.
<p>
Now that's just a rumor, and I haven't gotten anything from Trimpey explaining it
one way or the other. But it makes sense. There is no doubt that R.R. is disbanded and
shut down. Now it's a book and a course, and nobody can turn it into a cult.
<p>
There is still SMART, but so far, it shows no signs of turning into a cult.
Thank goodness.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

really curious as to why no one has ever written an article on the real A.A.
everything you have written is the truth, unfortunately i experienced it.
<p>
mel gibson is the latest example on how A.A. doesn't have to advertise itself.
judges, doctors, therapists even movies are doing it for them. mel gibson is being
forced to attend A.A.
<p>
i really liked your article or whatever, just wish someone would actually expose the
real A.A. in  a documentary, newspaper, somebody do something.!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Kiki,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments.
<p>
The problem of why you don't hear the truth more is certainly a frustrating one.
It seems to be a combination of inertia, ignorance, and institutional cowardice.
A lot of organizations and institutions and news networks
don't want to get involved in a big controversial information war,
and A.A. has a reputation for
<a href="orange-cult_a9.html#ca_threats4criticizing">
viciously attacking those who criticize it, or threaten its hegemony</a>.
<p>
And they have
<a href="orange-letters62.html#propaganda_mill">an immense propaganda mill</a>
that continues to crank out dishonest and misleading
publicity that is designed to make people believe that A.A. works well.
<p>
Mel Gibson getting sentenced to A.A. meetings is a joke &#8212; he's been going
to A.A. for many years, and is an A.A. true believer.
The rumor is that he would even hold on-location A.A. meetings while
filming <i>Braveheart</i> (where lots of the other actors were also A.A. members).
Just stop filming and have an A.A. meeting, right there, while still
dressed in kilts.

<p>
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have helped him much.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	OK, so Bill Wilson's a scumbag- what did you expect from an alcoholic?<br>

<p>

My first visit here.  Stopped drinking  (for the second time) about 2
years ago; going to AA.

<p>

This website has an astonishing amount of information, and is draped in
an even more astonishing amount of vitriolic hatred for AA.  What Step
were you on when you bailed out?  And what has caused you to hate AA so
much?

<p>

sincerely,<br>
Fred (not a saint, either)<br>

<p>

ps- the Vulcan race is fictional...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Fred,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety. You did it.
Nobody quit drinking for you.
<p>
If you had bothered to read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>,
you would have known that I bailed out of A.A. before doing any of the Steps.
I got smart fast, and decided that cult religion wasn't my cup of tea.
<p>
Here is the usual list of pages that describe how I got the attitude that I have:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction, my introduction to A.A.</a>, and also
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">the &quot;treatment&quot; bait-and-switch trick</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">another friend goes missing</a>.
</ol>
<p>

Your title line reveals the contempt that Alcoholics Anonymous actually has for alcoholics,
and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">the negative stereotype of 'the alcoholic'</a>
that A.A. spreads around:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;What did you expect from an alcoholic?&quot;</i></font><br>
<p>
A.A. doesn't &quot;unconditionally love&quot; alcoholics at all.
<p>
That is quite
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#unconditional_love">a bait-and-switch trick</a>:
<ol>
<li> First it's, &quot;Let us love you until you can love yourself. We offer you unconditional love and complete acceptance.&quot;
<li> Then it's contempt: &quot;What did you expect from an alcoholic?&quot;
</ol>

<p>
You also use the standard A.A. dodge of &quot;we are not saints&quot;
&#8212; which is supposed to mean that it is okay for A.A. members to commit
all sorts of sins and crimes &#8212; it's just normal, because we are not saints.
<p>
So what are you?

<p>
The reason that I have so much vitriol for A.A. is because it is a vile, low, despicable crime to
deliberately lie to sick people about what medicine or treatment might heal them.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
<ol>
<li>
&quot;RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.&quot;
<li>
&quot;Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried, 50% got sober at
once and remained that way; 25% sobered up after some relapses...&quot;
</ol>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Those statements are lies. They are not mistakes or misconceptions. They are deliberate lies
that are intended to fool people and get them to join Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
And that isn't spiritual.
<p>
Oh and of course I knew that the Vulcan race is fictional.<br>
And so are Superman, Batman, and Spiderman.<br>
And so is the A.A. Higher Power
<a href="orange-heresy.html#miracles_on_demand">who grants wishes and delivers
Miracles on Demand</a>, but only if you confess your sins to Him first.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	H.

<p>

Dear Orange:
<p>
There seems to be a debate within AA.  The issue appears to be &quot;weak AA&quot; versus
&quot;strong AA&quot;.  Weak AA appears to be come to meetings and don't pick up the first
drink.  Strong AA appears to study the big book and work the steps.
Tied to that debate is the flat or declining membership of AA.  There are
indications that AA membership has not changed from ca 1988.
Some in AA are arguing that this flat or declining membership is caused by the
popularity of &quot;weak AA&quot;

<p>

I find this interesting; you may wish to explore this.

<p>

My second point:  people with substance abuse problems must be able to make informed
choices regarding options.  AA is not, repeat not, the only option.

<p>

Please keep me anonymous.

Yes on that division in A.A., and there is also the moderate wing of A.A.
versus the &quot;Back To The Basics&quot; fundamentalists.
(I think we are saying that same thing with different words.)
<p>
The fundamentalists declare that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">Bill Wilson's lies about the great early success rate of A.A.</a>
are all true,
and that the reason that they are not getting anything like
that success rate today is because somebody &quot;modernized&quot;
and corrupted A.A., and if everybody will just become a true-believer
<i>Big Book</i> thumper, that A.A. will return to its former glory.
<p>
See
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://www.aabacktobasics.org/">
http://www.aabacktobasics.org/</a> for examples of that attitude.

<p>
This web page actually says that A.A. should go back to the practices
of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler">the Hitler-worshipping Oxford Group</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Even though he thought he was being true to the &quot;original&quot;
program, he had inadvertently incorporated some material from the 1970's
(specifically, the three and four column Fourth Step inventory) into the
Beginners' Meetings, and as a result, he wasn't seeing the recovery rates
that had been achieved by the Twelve Step pioneers.
<p>
Then in March of 1996, Wally met James Houck.  At the time, James was
90 years old and had been a sober member of the Oxford Group for sixty-one
years.  Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob Smith also were members of the Oxford Group
before they founded Alcoholics Anonymous in 1939.  James was the last
person alive who had attended Oxford Group meetings with Bill Wilson and
knew, from first hand experience, the spiritual roots and the fundamental
principles of the &quot;original&quot; Twelve Step program.<br>

<p>
I think I'll use some other &quot;basics&quot; for my religion, thank you anyway.

And have a good day.

Date:  	Sat, August 19, 2006 8:00 am<br>
From:  	&quot;Roy C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Bill Wilson/LSD/&quot;Pass it On&quot;<br>

<p>

Hi Orange
<p>
I stumbled across your site recently. As a disgruntled 15+ year sober
non-believing intermittent heretical AA member, I find the site's content
interesting, to put it mildly, replicating as it does many of my own
observations over the years; plus of course a vast amount of additional
material, for which I thank you.

<p>

I'm surprised that a quick site-search for &quot;LSD&quot; returns nothing, whilst a
search for &quot;Lysergic&quot; merely returns hits on references to academic papers
etc. A quick Google search led me to confirm my own memory &#8212; which I was
beginning to mistrust &#8212; of the account in &quot;Pass it on&quot; of BW's
over-enthusiastic endorsement of LSD as the instant route to spiritual
enlightenment: not that I avoided falling into this trap myself of course...
Unless I recall incorrectly (and it seems in character, so I don't think
that I'm wrong) he was also keen on spooning LSD down the neck of anyone who
would keep their mouth open long enough &#8212; including Lois, naturally. Even in
the muddle of &quot;early recovery&quot; this struck me as pretty rich! So I'm
surprised you don't include this episode amongst Bill's, ahem, &quot;character
defects&quot;.

<p>

Also, along with a few other equally sceptical friends I still have trouble
imagining that I would have abstained from alcohol had it not been for the
focus on the issue of alcolholism, and the social circle which AA gave me to
replace what went before. Even within my own pre-existing social circle &#8212;
not huge &#8212; I know a number of people to whom this also applies, and NO &quot;AA
failures&quot;. A statistically insiignificant sample, to be sure, but not I
think insignificant per se.

<p>

One other matter I haven't yet encountered in your site. Having had a
pre-&quot;recovery&quot; experience of hypnotherapy, I noticed quite quickly how the
format of AA meetings reproduces elements of the
induction/suggestion/release (my own inadequate formulation) format of
hypnotherapy. I have always believed this to be a component in AA's
effectiveness. Your carefully marshalled data claiming AA's
counter-effectiveness is an now interesting concept to examine in the light
of my own experience.

<p>

Apologies for sending you more mail. I don't doubt you receive more than
enough already, but... I checked the SMART website. Zero participants in all
chatrooms. This isn't exactly encouraging and certainly won't trouble AA.

<p>

From:  	&quot;Roy C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	retraction<br>

<p>

I just found the section about BW's use of LSD. Duh.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Roy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
No need to apologize for the email. I like getting various and sundry viewpoints.
<p>
About the LSD: Yes, I mention it, but don't want to really harp on it because I feel
like that would be too easy of a cheap shot.
<p>
And I have very mixed feelings about LSD, being
an old hippie and having taken it a couple of hundred times myself. So I certainly know
what spiritual and religious feelings Bill Wilson was talking about, and I don't knock them myself, either.
<p>
Still, it is revealing that in the 1950s Bill Wilson claimed that LSD was giving him the same religious
feelings as he got while detoxing in Towns' Hospital in 1934,
and <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">tripping on belladonna</a> and seeing God.
It would seem that most of Bill Wilson's ideas about spirituality were drug-induced.
(Again, same as me.)

<p>
But somehow, I was never able to make the leap from drug-induced feelings of spirituality to believing
that it's okay to lie to the newcomers in order to get them to join the organization.

<p>
I agree about the benefits of some kind of supportive social circle. That is probably the single
best facet of &quot;the recovery community&quot;. Of course, there are several groups or organizations that
can give such social support.
<p>
And we still have the fact that A.A.'s actual success rate merely matches the success rate of
the people who go it alone.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>

Thanks for taking the trouble to reply. The problem with creating such an
interesting site is &#8212; I imagine &#8212; the deluge of unsolicited emails, many of
which may well be, er, nuts?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Roy,
<p>
Ummm, yeh.
</font>
<p>

We have plenty in common it seems; I was partial to the odd mind-boggling
substance myself.
<p>
Not intending to drag you into a dialogue (aka &quot;dialog&quot;) I find it very
difficult trying to help other people who want to quit addictive consumption
habits without pointing them at AA/NA by default. I have an old friend who's
now into about three months of sobriety &#8212; I've been working on him for
nearly 14 years &#8212; and it's a juggling act how to address his objections to
AA as they're pretty much the same as my own. But there's no doubt that just
being around a bunch of other people who are focussed on staying sober is
indispensible, at least in the early stages. Where else could I suggest that
he go?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Is it indispensible? Has the efficacy of recovery groups ever been proven?<br>
We were just talking about that question in another exchange of letters,
<a href="orange-letters76.html#sick_groups">here</a>.
The gist of the message was that groups merely concentrate sick people who are not recovering.
The healthy, recovering people leave and get on with their lives, and the sick people
stay (and become the resident old-timers). Eventually the majority of the group is chronically sick.

<p>

I'm a bit underwhelmed by  SMART I'm afraid. The technology is a mess
(online meetings particularly) and it feels undisciplined and very lacking
in participants with some decent length of sobriety. Still, if it works...

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ummm, I would have to say that nothing &quot;works&quot;.<br>
That is, no groups will &quot;make&quot; addicts quit doping, or &quot;make&quot; alcoholics quit drinking.<br>
The idea that groups or meetings &quot;work&quot; is the myth of Alcoholics Anonymous (and
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult</a>
from which Bill Wilson copied the idea).<br>
Groups and meetings have never ever &quot;worked&quot;.
<p>
The purpose of SMART is to teach some techniques about &quot;How to Stop Driving Yourself Nuts&quot;.
That can help people to quit bad habits, but the burden is still on the individual addict
to decide to quit his self-destructive habits, and then really do it.
Think of SMART as a class, like high school algebra, rather than a &quot;recovery group&quot;.
<p>
Still, sometimes I feel guilty that I don't put in some time at the SMART online group, but I'm struggling
just to catch up on my email.
</font>
<p>

Thanks for the site. It makes me feel a lot more comfortable to see that the
conclusions I'd come to independently  (partly as a result of reading
&quot;Natural History of Alcoholism&quot;) are well supported by facts.

<p>
Interesting!

Subject:  	AAWS Board of Trustees<br>

<p>
Orange &#8212;
<p>
Do both the Class A (non-alcoholic) and the Class B  (alcoholic) members
of the Board of
Trustees both receive a $75,000 annual salary?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi G.S.,
<p>
Thanks for the questions. I don't have the financial filings for Alcoholics Anonymous (World)
Services, Inc.
on hand, so I will have to answer
these questions on a basis of &quot;best recollection&quot; and &quot;what I have heard&quot;.
(Although a lot of this information is available from the government,
because since the General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous (the &quot;GSO&quot;)
is officially a non-profit, they have to file financial statements with the government, and
those documents are open to public inspection.
See:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://www.eri-nonprofit-salaries.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NPO.Summary&amp;EIN=237282071&amp;Cobrandid=0">
http://www.eri-nonprofit-salaries.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=NPO.Summary&EIN;=237282071&Cobrandid;=0</a><br>
== General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous.


<p>
As far as I know, the Class A and Class B trustees of A.A.S. get the same $70,000 or $75,000 per year salary.
On the other hand, the trustees of the GSO seem to be unpaid.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB
(General Service Board of A.A.), for a total of $250,000 per year. And then his friend
Thomas Jasper gets $469,850 for being a &quot;Senior Advisor&quot;.
And many others get salaries in the range of $70,000 to $100,000 each.
<a href="orange-letters229.html#AAWS" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
</font>
<p>


Is AAWS incorporated as a company in the state of New York? How about the GSO?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes to both.
Both are incorporated in New York, I think.
Both have their headquarters in New York City.
<p>
To avoid confusion, let me define terms here: The old A.A.W.S. &#8212;
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.&quot; &#8212; the profit-making, book-publishing
corporation &#8212; renamed itself a few years ago,
dropping the word &quot;World&quot; from its name. So it appears to be just &quot;A.A.S.&quot; now.
The &quot;GSO&quot; as it is usually called, is a non-profit corporation, and is properly named
the &quot;General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;.)
<p>
The GSO owns 100% of the stock of the A.A.S. corporation, so the GSO gets all of the profits
of A.A.S.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that A.A. quietly reincorporated
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc. and
changed it into another non-profit corporation many years ago,
so that they wouldn't have to pay any taxes on book receipts.
</font>
<p>


Do they have paid employees or a  Board of Trustees?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, they have both, twice.
There are two corporations, and two boards, and two sets of executives,
and two headquarters office staffs.
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#Trustees">There is a 15-member Board of Trustees</a>
that governs AAS, and then there are the corporate executives,
then there is a large paid headquarters office staff there.
The Board of Trustees of the non-profit GSO appears to be unpaid, but their executives are paid
even more than the executives of the AAS seem to be.

</font>
<p>

Is the GSO incorporated?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, as a non-profit, tax-exempt corporation, under the IRS section 501(c), 527, or 4947(a) &#8212;
the same rules that give tax exemptions to religious, educational, and charitable organizations.
</font>

<p>
Can you or anyone estimate the total  salaries/compensation paid out
annually by the AA
organization?
<p>
<font color="blue">
The salaries of the Board of Trustees of A.A.S. is easy: 15 times $70,000 = $1,050,000 per year.
The President of AAS is also a Trustee, so he gets two salaries, which total about $125,000 per year,
I am told.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
CORRECTION (2011.03.28): It turns out that the trustees are not paid.
But other people get lots more.
The President and General Manager of A.A. Greg Muth gets $125,000 from both AAWS and the GSB

The salaries of the office and headquarters staff of the A.A.S. is anybody's guess.
<p>
<a name="AA_financials2"> </a>
The Trustees of the GSO appear to be unpaid, but the executives are getting very large salaries.
The most recent Form 990 that is available on the Internet (which is for 2004 &#8212;

<a href="237282071_2004_019a25d8.pdf">here for local copy</a>:)
says that the 5 highest paid employees <i>excluding officers, directors, and trustees</i> were:
<p>
<center>
<table width="61%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="3">

</table></center>
<p>
And then Schedule A says they have 12 other unnamed people who are paid more than $50,000 per year.
<p>
Curiously, their biggest contractor is Computer Solutions, who got paid $150,250 for computer
consulting. (Why does it take so much computer work to promote Alcoholics Anonymous?
$175,000 for the Electronic Data Processing Manager, and $150,000 more for computer consulting?
What the heck are they computing? It isn't that big of a job to maintain
a list of A.A. meetings.)
<p>
And page 18 of the 2004 filing says:
<p>
<center>
<table width="61%" border="6" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="3">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman"> Valerie O'Neill </font></td><td>

</table></center>
<p>
<a name="AA_financials3"> </a>
If the assistants get that much, how much do the full-blown Secretary and Treasurer get?
I'm still looking for that, along with the salaries of the President and Vice President(s).
<p>
On page 4, where the form asks for the salaries of &quot;Officers, Directors, Trustees, and Key Employees&quot;,
it just says &quot;See Statement 12.&quot;
<p>
But Statement 12 on page 18 mostly lists unpaid Trustees.
It does not list the executives or officers, other than the two Assistants
just mentioned above &#8212; O'Neill and Mueror.
<p>
So how much are the Big Boys getting?
That information seems to be missing. I wonder if that is illegal.
</font>

<p>
How about an estimate of the total annual income of the AA organization?
<p>
<font color="blue">
I hear that the A.A.S. has an annual income of around 11 or 12 million per year.
Part of that is eaten up in the cost of doing business, and paying their Trustees and
executives and staff. The left-over profits go to the GSO,
which listed an income of $7,061,977 for 2004,
and assets of $13,483,460,
of which $9,702,384 is U.S. Treasury Bonds &#8212; pure negotiable cash assets.

(Not bad for an impoverished little club of ex-drunkards, huh?)

Subject:  	A Concrete Example of Christian Forgiveness<br>

<p>

Hi Again, Orange!

<p>

The following, at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160315030114/http://www.tribstar.com/local/local_story_231231544.html">
http://www.tribstar.com/local/local_story_231231544.html</a>,

tells of
a priest and a nun telling a boy who'd been molested by another priest, to write to
him saying that he'd forgiven him.  That's certainly forgiveness along the lines of,
&quot;Taking as Jesus did this sinful world as it is not as I would have it.&quot;  And, in
truth, the Bible does quote Jesus as making some pretty extreme expectations on how
much mere mortals are expected to forgive.

Hi again, Sharen,
<p>
That is a grim article, isn't it? I find all of the references to drugs and alcohol
particularly revealing. So many of those abused boys went on to over-use drugs and alcohol
later in life. Like one said,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;It isn't something that just happens and goes away,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;It comes back when you least expect it. It comes back in negative ways.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And yet the A.A. answer is that those young men should confess <i>their</i> sins and wrongs and
moral shortcomings...

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Lori C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Good job! You did your homework<br>

<p>
Hi,

<p>
I found your site and have read a great deal of it this sunny afternoon in St.
Petersburg, Florida.  First, let me say that this time I've been sober for almost
seven months.  I had two and a half years of sobriety, from June of 2000 until April
of 2003 when I started drinking again.  I was also dependent on Xanax and Paxil.
Last February, when I tried to stop cold turkey off all three at once, I ended up in
the hospital where I detoxed for three days.  When they released me, they told my
husband that the rest was &quot;up to me whether or not I wanted to stop or die.&quot;

<p>
I tried going to AA again this time, and I enjoyed it at first, but then I was able
to find a job which made it difficult to attend meetings.  I had been feeling guilty
about that and worried that if I didn't follow the &quot;steps&quot; I was doomed to start
drinking again. I hope I don't, since I do believe my brain can't take it.  My
mother died of liver failure at the age of 56 &#8212; it seemed to attack her there.  I
will be 58 at the end of this month and my liver seems fine at the moment.  The
alcohol seemed to attack my brain.
<p>
Several things about Bill W had always bothered me.  First, the idea of seeing a
white light and finding God.  That was hard to swallow.  Also, I have never liked
the idea of AA or any religion stating that they have the ONE answer.

<p>
So, if AA is not the answer, what is?    I know that I have serious mental problems.
My father was a manic depressive, like his mother, and he died of a heart attack at
age 45.  His father had also abused alcohol.  His sister died an alcoholic at the
age of 42.

<p>

I'd appreciate any insight about what I can do to stay sober.  My life is better
when I'm not drinking.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p>

Lori

Hi Lori,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety.

<p>
When you ask, &quot;What is the answer?&quot; the answer is actually so simple that a lot of people
think that it can't be true. The answer is:
<p>
<center>
<b>Just don't drink any more alcohol, not ever, not for any reason.<br>
Just don't take that first drink, no matter what.</b>
</center>

<p>
Programs or organizations have nothing to do with that. Neither do cult religions.

<p>
Now some people will object and say that they can't do it, or that they will fail and backslide,
or relapse. My answer is, &quot;Please don't be so pessimistic. Things don't have to be that bad.&quot;
<p>
Like Richard Bach (the author of <i>Johnathan Livingston Seagull</i>) said,
&quot;Argue for your limitations, and sure enough they're yours.&quot;
<p>

One thing that has helped me a lot is understanding how the craving center in the base brain
will constantly complain and jabber and demand a hit of something to feel better. I wrote up
a whole web page on that. See
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.

P.S.: Did you know that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#spiritualexperience">Bill Wilson's
&quot;white light&quot; experience</a>
was actually him detoxing in the hospital and tripping his brains
out on
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">hallucinogenic drugs, particularly belladonna</a>?
The popular quack cure of the time for alcoholism
was to dose alcoholics with an appallingly toxic mess of drugs.
It is no surprise that Bill Wilson saw &quot;God&quot; and had a
&quot;religious experience&quot;. He was just flat-assed stoned out of his gourd.
