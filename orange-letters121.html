Subject:  	oh, please<br>

<p>
you must be some fucking moron.

<p>
there is no &quot;leader&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>
you can believe whatever you want.  accept what you will... leave the rest behind.<br>
REPEATEDLY in the AA big book and the 12 and 12... it cautions the reader that there
isn't one single way to do this thing called recovery... and that nothing should be
accepted as gospel.<br>
bill repeatedly said that you can do the steps to the best of your ability and, if
you can't do them in order, why don't you do what you can.

<p>
the steps are almost plainly obvious.

<p>
<ul>
<p><li>         admit you fucked up and you're done with drugs (including alcohol, which is a drug
like any other)
<p><li>         accept that some power outside yourself can help you (because, within yourself, ya
ain't findin the answers.)  if it turns out that it can't, fuck it.  at least you
tried.  fo' sho', fo' sho'... your own way has ZERO chance of getting you clean and
keeping you clean.  it's proven a miserable failure time and time again.
<p><li>         when you find that power, &quot;turn yourself over&quot; to it... in the sense that if
something works, you ought to devote yourself to pursuing it
<a name="resentment"> </a>
<p><li>         take a look at yourself.  where have you fucked up?  what are your resentments?
surely even an AA skeptic like you can see that it would be a good idea to look at
resentments, can't you?  after all, the person who carries them around is carrying
around a lump of shit in his/her heart that doesn't change anything accept his/her
attitudes/outlook on life and makes him/her unhappy
<p><li>         then you get it off your chest
<p><li>         then you can actually look at your faults and think about changing them
<a name="no_god"> </a>
<p><li>         then earnestly, within your heart, you ask for change.  fuck the god part.  &quot;god&quot;
is whatever you want that to mean.  &quot;deep down inside&quot; you ask of your whole being
that you leave the faults behind.
<p><li>         at that point you can start earnestly looking at the reparations you need to make.
why not sooner?  because you're the same dipshit who pulled the crap on those
people, and you're not likely to keep from doing that same stuff again unless you've
worked on yourself.  DUH!  how can i go to someone and apologize if part of it
isn't... &quot;i will do my best to never do that again.&quot;  never again, huh?  never again
means i'm not that same loser who did that stuff anymore.  i've worked on myself.
<p><li>         then you can actually go and make those amends.
<p><li>         how about then you keep your house clean on a daily basis?  you shit all over the
place before.  now that it's a clean, liveable place... howza boutz you keep it that
way so you can be functional.
<p><li>         prayer and meditation don't hurt at this point.  they keep a person CENTERED so
that maybe he/she get introspective enough that he/she doesn't walk into the same
stupid situations that he/she did before when he/she was out there gettin
loadidfied.
<p><li>         and then... helping other people.  have you ever done that, or are you all about
just poking holes in organizations that benefit others?  when you help people, you
feel good. you don't feel like drinking.  i used to pop two eightballs up my nose
per day at one time.  i'm totally high on helping young kids whose lives are fucked
up and are stuck in juvenile hall.  if you do that sometime, let me know how that
feels.
</ul>

<p>
my sponsor has 41 years of sobriety.  i've met thousands of AAs and NAs with 20+
years sobriety/clean-time.  you show me the thousands and thousands who have
abstained for 20+ years.  i'll bet you my dick and balls you can't find more than a
handful.  a two eight-ball a night jerkoff like me does not suddenly come to his
senses and say, &quot;ya know what... i think i've had enough of this stuff forever&quot; and
never snorts another line.  doesn't happen.  i tried hundreds of times to quit.
it's only with 12-step philosophy and practice that i've gotten two years clean.

<p>
oh, i forgot that i bow down and kiss bill wilson's ass every morning and say secret
sacred AA chants that i'm forced to repeat by the evil powers that be in that
organization who are controlling my mind remotely by a chip implanted in my brain.
wanker...

<p>
am i a shining example of AA principles for writing to you and telling you to lump
it?  probably not.  but i'm not a cult member.  i do whatever the fuck i please.  if
i feel like getting angry at you... well... maybe i damn well should!  you're
propagating a bunch of idiot lies.  OBVIOUSLY you've never fully read bill wilson's
writing.

<p>
did you ever read alexander pope?  i think he has a little ditty that goes something
like this...

<p>
<blockquote>
&quot;a little learning is a dangerous thing
drink deep or taste not the pierian spring
there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain
and drinking largely sobers us again.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>
sober up, bruvva man!

<p>
hey, and guess what?  the moment i send this, my anger will pass out of my fingers,
body and mind.  i'll have a great day.  no resentments!

<p>
did i leave out... &quot;eat shit and die&quot;?  oh.  i guess not.

<p>
take care!

<p>
slogans are simply the bullshit PRACTICES of some assholes in the room.

<p>
there is NOTHING WHATSOEVER that says

<p>
fake it till you make it<br>
work the step or die!

<p>
etc.

<p>
nothing of that nature in bill wilson's literature.

<p>
and as for the grandiose claims of redemption... leave other people's faith to them
fucking selves, nitwit.  i'm an agnostic, but i respect other people's faith.  if
they want to think that way and it helps them, good for them.  it never says
anywhere in the big book or 12x12 that you need to adopt this or that god, but that
you do need to take on a spiritual way of life.  spiritual may, to those of limited
capacity who can only read dictionaries, denote that which literally has to do with
the divine aspect of a human being.  to me... it means that part of a person which
accepts that it is part of something bigger... is humble... open-minded.  it is
gnosis.  the complete being as a single function.  not a jumble of thoughts or
emotions, but the whole integral self.

<p>
that is not written in the most graceful, wonderful prose... nor is it well thought
out.

<p>
but come on, man!  it's ALL OVER wilson's writing!  you don't have to follow my way.
follow your own star.

<p>
what people say in the rooms of AA is their own idiot business.  for each person who
says... &quot;there is ONE program: THE program&quot; there is another guy like me who says,
&quot;fuck dat, yo.  there are as many programs in this room as there are people in this
room.&quot;

<p>
it is only the closed-minded who hear one type of person... all the slogans... the
jingos... who gets nothing out of the &quot;shares&quot; but that which they want to hear with
their twisted, sadistic little minds which think nothing of drunks but that they're
the rubbish of society and deserve their misfortune.

<p>
i read your jerkoff page.  the way you refer to drunks as a bunch of worthless
pieces of shit is remarkable.

<p>
Will being a booze-hound really get you that much good stuff?

<p>
Booze-hound, huh?  Really?  that your first born be a gutter booze hound and that
you learn by painful experience what it is to love another human being who can't
find any love for himself!  and that you may learn what, in recovery, that selfsame
booze hound child of yours may achieve.

<p>
nothing more or less than the next guy.  but for a &quot;booze hound&quot;, just to be
functional and &quot;part of&quot; society is an incredible, incredible achievement FOR HIM.

<p>
you don't have to think anything of it.  it doesn't change anything, what you think.

<p>
i'm only pissed off at you not because you are so ridiculously opposed to 12-step,
but because you're clearly a recovery naysayer.  that's disgusting.  the fact that
you're so smug and self-centered that you devote your time to poking holes in things
that work for SOME people says a lot about your character (i.e., lack thereof.)

<p>
what works for you is great for you.  what works for others is great for them.  to
claim that AA is a cult simply misses the definition of cult.  how can anything be
called a cult where the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop
drinking/using?

<p>
Steve C.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, Steve,
<p>
You really get upset when someone critically examines Alcoholics Anonymous, don't you?
<p>
I'll just leave your letters as they are. They aren't worth answering in detail.
You really do a good job of making my points for me. I offer your two letters as
evidence that A.A. really is a cult.
<p>
But there is one glaring contradiction in your first letter,
in your idea of &quot;the A.A. Program&quot;, that I have to comment on:
<ol>
<li>
First, you declare:<br>
<font color="black">
accept that some power outside yourself can help you (because, within yourself, ya ain't findin the answers.)
</font>
<p>
<li> A little later, you declare:<br>
<font color="black">
 fuck the god part. &quot;god&quot; is whatever you want that to mean. &quot;deep down inside&quot; you ask of your whole being that you leave the faults behind.
</font>
</ol>

<p>
First you  say that the answer must come from outside of yourself because you aren't
finding the answers within you, and then, a little later, you
say &quot;fuck the god part &#8212; the answer is deep down within you.&quot;
So somewhere around Step 1 or Step 2, you are saying that you need
the help of &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
but then around Step 7 you decide that you can correct all of your &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; without &quot;Higher Power&quot; (God).
That makes no sense. You can't have it both ways.

<p>
And this is grossly wrong, and exactly backwards:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;the way you refer to drunks as a bunch of worthless pieces of shit is remarkable&quot;.<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson was the one who basically referred to drunkards as 
worthless pieces of shit, not me. I never said any such thing.
Please learn to read. Then go read the file on
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy</a>
where I list a lot of Bill Wilson's put-downs of alcoholics.
Also read item 2 of the cult test,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_you_wrong">You are always wrong</a>,
and item 90,
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers">Newcomers Need Fixing</a>
for more of the standard A.A. put-downs of alcoholics.

<p>
By the way, &quot;Fake It Until You Make It&quot;, and &quot;Act As If&quot;,
have been part of A.A. practices and slogans since before A.A. began.
That is, they were
<a href="orange-rroot450.html#act_as_if">creations of the Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker</a>,
when he was the second in commmand of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult.
Shoemaker created those practices to aid in the religious conversion of prospective victims.
Bill Wilson learned all of that cult religion stuff from Sam Shoemaker while he was a
member of the Oxford Group. Bill Wilson even said so:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Early AA got it's ideas of self-examination,
acknowledgement of character defects, restitution for
harm done, and working with others straight from the
Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.<br>

All of the goslings are looking at me expectantly, hoping that I will toss them
some more &quot;bagel bits&quot;.<br>
Carmen is the small one in the middle.
</center>
<p>
The goslings' jaws and beaks are not strong enough for them to be able to rip a bagel
apart. But they can eat it when I tear the bagel into little pieces and toss the
pieces to them. So they were hoping that I would do that for them. I did.
<p>
Carmen didn't really care about the bagel that much. She was very well-fed, not
really hungry like the other goslings that were out in the tough real world,
scrounging for a meal.
But Carmen did whatever all of the other goslings did, just to fit in.

Wow, I found your page and what great work you are doing. I was AA for the better
part of 20 years and saw, heard and preached all that muck! I tell people today,
&quot;Can you believe I was once part of a cult..........AA!&quot;

<p>
The bitch about it is I spent 20 years convincing my family about &quot;the disease&quot; and
my NEED to go to meetings. Now, they call me &quot;dry drunk&quot; because I have nothing to
say good about AA. Now, I get to spend the next 20 years trying to convince them
that it was all bull.

<p>
My sisters say &quot;you've changed!&quot; I say yes, I'm not a victim anymore. I fixed myself
and like (love) myself just fine.

<p>
I live and am from New Orleans. I am a working artist and have a happy life. Lots of
my old AA friends just cant understand that what I do works for me. From time to
time I well bump into an old AA friend and will always be asked &quot;You drinking?&quot; I
say, &quot;You cheat on your spouse, or your taxes?&quot; In other words,
don't hold that guilt yard-stick up to me!

<p>
Anyway thank for what is clearly a very time consuming process. Putting the info out
there.

Obviously you have vague knowledge of what it is like to recover from a seemingly
hopelless , helpless state of mind. i am a recovered alcoholic and it is through the
simple program of alcoholics anonymous that i've found my help.
you stated in your ramblings that this program is a religion-it is not,it is a
sound set of principles for living. our guidelines for living have been set down
by people who have a common problem and have found through experience that one
alcoholic helping another is what works.
<p>
a &quot; higher power &quot; , a god of your own understanding, is an essential part of our
recovery process. you have obviously devoted a lot of unnecessary time trying to
convince another that a program only an alcoholic can understand , does not work .
you need only look in the book of james to understand these principles. if you may
be agnostic or atheist maybe you may consider another of a.a. essentials- that
being open-mindedness- also if the alcoholic anonymous program is all you say, why
has it helped millions of people in over 150 countrys recover from there hopeless
, helpless state of mind ?
god bless you for your time and understanding .

Hello John,
<p>
Actually, I have a lot of experience with alcohol addiction and recovery.
Try reading
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>,
for starters.
Why do you think I was in an &quot;alcohol treatment program&quot;?
And I now have 8 1/2 years off of
alcohol, tobacco, and any other drugs.  So yes, I've been through the mill,
and I know about addiction and recovery.

You said,

By an odd coincidence, I just received
<a href="orange-letters121.html#no_god">another letter from an angry A.A. member</a>
who explained &quot;the Program&quot; this way:<br>

Why do we get this constant alternation between &quot;God&quot; and
&quot;no god&quot;? It looks suspiciously like

First, &quot;You don't have to believe in God&quot;, and then you do.

And if &quot;god&quot; (lower-case 'g') can be anything, then god can
easily be something that cannot help you. I don't really believe that
using a bedpan, doorknob, or rock, as my &quot;higher power&quot; is
going to save me from addiction. Do you?
<p>
Then you declared,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;you have obviously devoted a lot of unnecessary time trying to
convince another that a program only an alcoholic can understand , does not work .&quot;
</font><br>
That is just a game of one-upmanship, trying to declare that I cannot understand
A.A. because I am supposedly not an alcoholic.  The funny thing is, everybody who
knows me, or knew me back when,
agrees that I'm an alcoholic. Ex-wife, children, friends, coworkers, everybody.
My doctor went so far as to say,
<font color="#9F0000">&quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;</font>
<p>
But when I criticize the insanity of Alcoholics 
Anonymous, suddenly I'm allegedly not an alcoholic,
so I supposedly can't understand how A.A. really works.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers">Which it doesn't</a>.)
<p>
The claim that outsiders can't really understand the wonderfulness of the organization
is just another standard cult characteristic.
Look at
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">The cult and its members are special</a> and
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_enemy">Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider</a>.

<p>
The Oxford Group liked to quote the Book of James to justify their
twisted theology and heretical cult practices, but the Christian Church
rejected and banned James' practices like group confessions nearly 1600
years ago, because of the many problems that practice caused. (And the correct
term is &quot;practice&quot;, not &quot;spiritual principle&quot;.)
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#St_James">Look here</a>.
So, no, I'm not going to look into the Book of James to see the
&quot;A.A. principles&quot;.

<p>
You are again repeating <a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">the Biggest Lie</a>
of Alcoholics Anonymous:<br>
<font color="black">&quot;It has helped millions of people in over 150 countrys&quot;</font>.<br>
No it hasn't. We were just discussing that a few letters back, so

Have a good day.

<p>
Why the fierce attack against AA?  It seems to me you take examples out of the big
book and use unfounded examples.  In all the time I have gone to AA I have never
been in a group that told me I was wrong, I was going to die if I didn't do AA,
etc.  All of your negative examples I have never once seen.  I've gone to perhaps 20
different meetings, some of which I attend regularily.  What did you do to research
your claims, as I find nearly all of them to be untrue.

<p>
btw, I liked your rendition of the twelves steps (with santa claus in them and
whatnot).  I told that to my sponsor and he laughed.  Something you say won't happen
in AA.  Weird how that happened.

<p>

Hello Jacob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You seem to have found some very nice A.A. groups. Lucky you.
The fact that you have personally never seen anything bad happen in Alcoholics
Anonymous doesn't mean that it isn't happening. As Carl Sagan used to say,
&quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;

Dear Orange Guy:
<p>
You know if you attacked any organization, however good they may be,
with the same negative zeal as you just ripped 12 step programs I'm sure
you could dig enough dirt to send Mother Theresa's group to life at hard
labour.
<p>
While I admit that Bill Wilson was a failed AA all his life and that he
was probably quite insane when he died, the concept of what the first
several hundred AA's started is real and do-able.
<p>
Granted AA is probably a dying organization because they are very
orthodox and unchanging, NA has attempted to fix all that crap. For
example, saying a higher power of your understanding and then in the
next sentence proclaiming that it's a &quot;Him&quot; and his name is &quot;God&quot;.
NA has long had problems with AA purists and our organization works.
<p>
You quote as many &quot;fools&quot; with statistics as AA does. All I know is
that, at 55, I'm still alive and all my friends from my youth are now
either dead (most) or insane (a few). The difference &#8212; I went to NA and
worked the 12 steps and still do.
<p>
Thanks for the entertaining web page but I think before you resume your
crusade you should take a look in a mirror and get at the root of all
that misplaced anger.
<p>

Hello Eric,
<p>
Mother Teresa didn't sell quack medicine as a cure for a deadly problem.
Mother Teresa didn't use the courts and police and judges and parole officers
to force people into her organization.
<p>
The rest of your letter is basically logical fallacies. You start with
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a> &#8212;
<font color="black">
<i>&quot;the problem was just Bill Wilson and A.A. purists&quot;</i></font>.
(No, the problem is that the 12-Step program is a cult religion fraud.)
<p>
Then you claim that Narcotics Anonymous works and fixes all
of the problems with Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; but you supply zero evidence
to support those claims. You don't supply any facts like the all-important
actual N.A. cure rate.
You just use a simple
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote">
<i>Proof by Anecdote</i></a> argument &#8212;
<font color="black">
&quot;I'm alive today because I drank Dr. Bummer's Magic Koolaid.&quot;
</font>
<p>
No, you are alive today because you stopped killing yourself with drugs, not
because you joined a cult religion.
<p>
And you argue that,
<font color="black">
&quot;You quote as many &quot;fools&quot; with statistics as AA does.&quot;</font>
<br>
No, I quote doctors who know what they are talking about.<br>
<p>
Trying to reject statistics is the last refuge of someone who is losing an
argument. It is also the propaganda trick and mind game called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#antirationalism">Antirationalism</a>,
which is the argument that there is no real rational knowledge,
that we cannot know the truth. Baloney. Yes we can, and yes we do.
<p>
Please supply a success rate. If we send 1000 randomly-selected alcoholics
or drug addicts to Narcotics Anonymous, how many of them will pick up a
neat glow-in-the-dark one-year &quot;clean and sober&quot; keytag
a year later? And a black multi-year keytag two years later?
The answer is important. The answer shows whether the N.A. program actually
works.
<p>
By the way, I've still got my keytags &#8212; the whole set, including the 1-year
and multi-year tags &#8212; but I didn't get them by following
the teachings of either A.A. or N.A.; I got them by rejecting the teachings of
both A.A. and N.A., and using my own common sense and determination to save my
own life. That of course invalidates N.A. Step One:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;We admitted we were powerless over our addiction, that our lives had become unmanageable.&quot;
</font><br>
That is bad misinformation &#8212; fatal misinformation.
If I were powerless over my addictions, I'd be dead.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi

<p>
Your website has been of great use to me in under standing what my wife is
going through in AA, we are getting divorced, and I think it all comes down
to her sponsor and AA indoctrination, that I am bad because I will not get a
program (I do not believe in a higher power or abuse alcohol) and want her
to drink again. She also suffers from bi-polar and PDD which does not help.
All very sad for me and the kids but it seems that is the way it is.

<p>
Why not have a forum where people could learn from others about problems like
this with AA. I can set it up for you or host it for you. It would be easier
to search and follow than read through all your emails and people could chat
about problems like I have been having.

Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way behind on answering
email.
<p>
And I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. Destroying marriages is one of the worst
things that the 12-Step cult does. About the only thing worse is causing people
to die. Which they also do.
<p>
I have been thinking real hard about a forum or bulletin board system. When I
chose the current host system (Hostmonster.com), I made sure that they were running Linux
and that I could install my own custom cgi-bin, just so that I could do such things.
(I am an old cgi-bin computer programmer myself, so that part of the work isn't
a problem.)
<p>
Can you suggest some good free software for a forum system? Ideally, it should allow
multiple forums with multiple threads, and all of the usual features.
Allowing embedded images would be really nice too. I'm sure I'm not the only one
taking pictures of cute things like ducklings and goslings that they might want
to share.
<p>
And I know I will need the
help of volunteer moderators, because I don't seem to have much spare time for
running and managing such a system myself &#8212;
I'm still way behind just in answering email and working on the occasional web page.
And summer is here, and the river and sunshine and cute goslings are calling...

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
More than eight years ago, I was alcohol-dependent, and had been so for
most of my 22 year-long drinking history. Eventually the disgraceful
consequences of my drinking (and signs of liver disease) were too much
to pay for the &quot;benefit&quot; of getting drunk and I decided I wasn't going
to drink anymore. I believed then, and still do, that I no longer have
any moral licence to drink. I subsequently have not touched a single
drop of alcohol, and I have no sense of missing anything in life by
being abstinent. I know that even if I could somehow avoid the bad
consequences of drinking, the best I could get out of a hypothetical
drink now is no more than what I got out of it thousands of times
before. I just have no interest in drinking again  &#8212; I've moved on.

<p>
At the time I made this decision for abstinence, I did feel that I
needed the emotional support of abstainers in making this sudden move
from being a drunk to being alcohol-free. I went to my first AA meeting
in search of such support, which in large measure I did get. On top of
this, I also got all of the &quot;advice&quot;: get a sponsor, go to meetings, go
especially to steps meetings, listen, and so on. I baulked at the idea
of &quot;getting a sponsor&quot;. The word &quot;sponsor&quot; means someone who gives
financial support to a community group, for example a sports club, and
gets some advertising in return. Was someone going to pay me money to
wear a shirt with his name on it? I recognized absurdity right from the
beginning &#8212; I was only an idiot when I drank, I'm not usually an idiot
otherwise. Early on, I saw a couple of cases of new AA members driven
out by dysfunctional old-timer sponsors. I've also never accepted the
dogmatic disease-of-alcoholism model, and got away with saying so at a
couple of meetings. My attitude though, was if the emotional support I
needed was available, I could ignore a degree of nonsense, especially
recognizing the slogan &quot;take what you want and ignore the rest&quot;. I never
did invite a &quot;sponsor&quot; to control any part of my life. I was also
perplexed about what relevance the twelve steps had in recovery from
alcohol dependence. To be sure, some of the content in itself is good &#8212; 
for example, making amends for misdeeds &#8212; but what significance does
this have for someone pushed by a sponsor to do it, under threat of
relapsing into drunkeness otherwise? Anything good in the steps is
removed by the AA context. As a drunk, I often freely made amends to
people for bad behaviour, with no effect, or expectation of effect, on
subsequent drinking.

<p>
So up to here, I've got no sponsor, and I'm ignoring the steps, at least
in their dysfunctional AA context, but I'm attending meetings for
emotional support, not drinking anymore, and not missing it. At first I
was attending four or five meetings a week, and did service as group
treasurer for one of them &#8212; at two months in. Taking this up was the
first of several uncomfortable experiences, revealing something of the
sick nature of much of AA. The group needed a treasurer, and strangely
no-one present wanted to do it. Naively, I volunteered, to the objection
of one &quot;old-timer&quot; I hadn't seen there before spouting rules about
needing at least six months sobriety to take up AA service. The others
shushed him up with some effort, and I was the treasurer. As it turned
out, the &quot;old timer&quot; was a group regular who had been overseas for a
couple of months, and when present dominated the meeting with abusive
put-downs of anyone present, and declarations of his perceived
superiority. He particularly didn't like my university background, and
let me know from the floor many times that I was just a &quot;useless
academic&quot;. What could I do now that I had taken on a group role that
obligated me to attend this meeting every week with this AA-conditioned
narcissistic lunatic? I realized also that the rest of the group had
deliberately dumped me in it &#8212; none of them wanted to be obligated to be
in the room with this madman every week!
<p>
What is also clear in this,
Orange, is your own point that there is no organizational structure in
AA to remove people who more desperately need professional psychiatric
counselling. Eventually, I was courageous enough to turn up at the
meeting and announce I was passing on the treasurer job and leaving the
group. Of course my mad friend who objected to me taking it up in the
first place had plenty to say about me &quot;dumping the job&quot; and harangued
me about my &quot;lack of integrity&quot; until I could get away, never to return.
I was sensible enough to just roll with the punches for about twenty
minutes, knowing that I would never see this sociopath again (and I
haven't).

<p>
I kept up other meetings though, and made it my policy to drop meetings
where I experience sick attitudes. When I heard conversation at one of
the meetings about thirteenth-step conquests on the meeting table (!)
before the opening of the meeting, that meeting went. When I heard
someone else claiming, in all apparent seriousness, that he derives
divine power from the knob on the door to not drink, and the following
week someone else make the same claim about the chair he was sitting on
(no-one there ever batted an eyelid!), that meeting went. At meetings
I've witnessed people getting shouted down for saying AA is a religion &#8212; 
while taking people seriously who worship doorknobs and chairs?

<p>
I currently attend just one small meeting, and not every week anymore. I
regard the core of the group as friends (none of them are mad
old-timers), but really the main reason I'm still there is I'm the
treasurer (yet again a group treasurer!), and there haven't been any
sufficiently bad or mad experiences there yet (apart from the standard
readings, which I just lethargically defocus from). Having said this,
Orange, your critical analysis of AA has given me the energy and
inspiration to make the remaining final break from this dysfunctional
outfit that I've never really believed in and definitely don't need.
It's getting near impossible now to go through the motions of &quot;sharing&quot;
dogmatic step program-based BS at meetings and still live with myself
(especially the pretence that even after eight+ years of abstinence, I
still suffer from a &quot;disease&quot; that might cast me back into drunkenness
at any moment). After reading your material, I feel a bit stupid that
after eight years I'm still attending a meeting, but I feel very lucky
that at least I had the sense to never get a sponsor.

<p>
Hey Orange,
<p>
How's it going? Glad to see you are posting letters again &#8212; one of my favorite
pastimes is reading both those letters and your pithy replies.

<p>
Anyway, one of the ways I'm trying to dismantle the huge AA juggernaut is to
engaging the local pastors at the churches where the cult meets. I've had a
few dialogues and, while not seeing any progress, at least have been given the
opportunity to express the 1) heretical nature of the organization, and 2) describe
in detail its failure rate.

<p>
I also pointed out that there were occasions where I saw drug, alcohol, and
sometimes sexual activity on their premises before-during-or after meetings by some
of these upstanding pillars of recovery. I thought it might help to provide the
clergy with a little more detailed information about who enters their doors.

<p>
I also inquired to the head of the local United Way about the dollar amounts given
to a couple of local halfway houses. I found out that each gets about $30,000
dollars per year. I then wrote back to the United Way, citing facts and
figures about the zero success rate of the 12 step programs, which of course these
institutions foist on its hapless clients.

<p>
I'm writing letters to the local papers, and will contact my governement officals
about this as well.

<p>
I was just thinking back to when I was collared and corraled into one of the
halfway houses I mentioned above. It was supposed to be a 6-month course of
treatment but it turned into 14 months. I nearly lost my marriage over it. Anyway,
one day we were being driven home from our menial jobs (which they encouraged us to
take and be proud &#8212; aspiring to anything more was deemed &quot;egoism&quot; and
&quot;self-will...&quot;) by one of the &quot;phase 2 guys&quot; (&quot;phase 2&quot; means you've been there
longer and are peceived as a &quot;role model&quot;) when we were almost killed in a near
head-on accident with a fully loaded gravel truck. Fortunately there were only
bumps, bruises, and strains.

<p>
When we got back to the halfway house the staff had all the guys who were in the van
huddle up in one of the counselors offices. The State Police were on their way to
the halfway house to interview the people in the van. Well don't you know the
spiritual staff told us to lie about what happened, i.e. we were all wearing
seatbelts (not all of us wore them) and that we were going the speed limit (we
weren't) and etc. etc.

<p>
Yep, that's AA in action. That's doing God's will alright; lying to 5-0 so that they
could get over and continue their patina of righteousness. Because if the truth got
out their criminally operated gravy train would run out.

<p>
So Orange &#8212; how do like THAT spirituality?

<font color="blue">
Hi again, Bill,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story. And thanks for all of your activism. If enough
people write those letters and make a fuss about the 12-Step hoax, something good
really might happen, especially now while we have both massive budget cuts due to the
destroyed American economy, and a new administration that is less dogmatic and
crazy. The hoax machine might find its funding cut.
<p>
By the way, demanding real results from treatment programs and half-way houses
and similar things is a great approach. I recently learned that the
State of Oregon has wisely inserted demands for proof of efficacy into funding
for Substance Abuse Treatment programs and the like.  That is the kiss of death
to the quack healers, because their frauds do not have any efficacy.
So demanding that the taxpayers get a thousand dollars worth of cure for a thousand
dollars of funding is a very good strategy.

So keep up the good work, and keep your fingers crossed.

And have a good day.
