</center>
<p>
When people share their stories at A.A. meetings, they often
talk at length about how bad it
was to drink.  They describe all of the horrible pain that they
went through, and all of the
heartbreak and suffering that alcohol caused them and their
families.  They all agree that drinking
made them feel just awful, sick to death.  And all of the stories
in the Big Book follow exactly
the same format.  What they all carefully avoid ever talking
about is how much fun it was to get
drunk, and all of the pleasure alcohol gave them.
<p>
Let's face it: drinking alcohol gave us alcoholics pleasure,
a <i>lot</i> of pleasure.  So
much pleasure that we worked extremely hard at getting and
drinking more alcohol.  We pursued
alcohol with a fanatical single-minded determination.  There was
nothing weak about our will
power when it came to getting more alcohol.  We persevered in our
quest for the joy of alcohol in
spite of all of the hardships and obstacles thrown in our paths,
and in spite of great costs to us in
terms of our jobs, our marriages, our health, and sometimes even
our lives.  And we usually
succeeded in our quest for more alcohol.  And we weren't drinking
all of that alcohol because we
wanted to feel bad.
<p>
<a name="revelation">
The A.A. members</a> like to claim that they drank because they
have a disease, and the disease
forced them to drink, often against their wishes.  They would
have quit long ago, they say, but the
damn disease just kept reaching for another drink.
Step One said that they were &quot;powerless over alcohol.&quot;
That gets them off the hook, and they don't
have to accept responsibility for anything.  In the Big Book, a
woman finds the standard A.A. party
line about alcoholism to be a &quot;revelation&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;I wasn't mad or vicious &#8212; I was a sick person.
I was suffering from an actual disease that had a name
and symptoms like diabetes or cancer or TB &#8212; and a
disease was respectable, not a moral stigma!&quot;
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, Page 227.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="no_fun"> </a>
While the A.A. members are doing their fearless moral
inventories, and finding all of their
defects of character, and wallowing in guilt about lots of other
stuff, the one thing they don't want
to list, the one thing they won't look at, is memories of gladly,
happily, gleefully getting and
drinking alcohol, and enjoying it. If they looked too closely at
that, they would have to see that
neither a disease nor the Devil made them drink. They would see
that they drank because they
wanted to drink, because they really loved the way it made them
feel.  They would see that it was always their choice.
<p>

But the A.A. alcoholics who read the beginning
of Chapter 5 of the Big Book at the start of every
meeting, talking about being constitutionally
capable of being honest with themselves,
don't seem to want to be honest about that.
And the <i>Big Book</i> just repeats the same &quot;no fun&quot; theme often,
along with the &quot;compulsive disease&quot; theme:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Blackout drinking at once. I had no pleasure out of the drinking at all.
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Third Edition, Page 195.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I was never a hilarious drunk; the more I drank the quieter
I got, and the drunker I got the harder I fought to stay sober.
So it is clear that I never had any fun out of drinking...
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Third Edition, Page 241.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I was being pushed around with a compulsion to drink that was
completely beyond my control. I couldn't stop drinking.
I would hang on to sobriety for short intervals, but always
there would come the tide of an overpowering <i>necessity</i>
to drink and, as I was engulfed in it, I felt such a sense of
panic that I really believed I would die if I didn't get that
drink inside.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Needless to say, this was not pleasurable drinking.
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Third Edition, Pages 305-306.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It helped me a lot to become convinced that alcoholism was a disease, not
a moral issue; that I had been drinking as a result of a compulsion,
even though I had not been aware of the compulsion at the time;
and that sobriety was not a matter of will power.
<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Third Edition, page 448.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I think I had the physical allergy right away. A drink never
gave me a normal, pleasant glow.
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, Third Edition, Page 402.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>Yes, it's all just that damn disease,
just always reaching for another drink,
even though it isn't any fun at all.
It doesn't even feel good. I don't get a warm rush off of it.
I don't get a pleasant buzz from it. It isn't my fault; the Devil
made me do it.</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
 
Talk about being in denial...
<p>
There is an implicit social contract at A.A. meetings, to not
talk about the fun, the joy, and
the pleasure, of drinking.  They say it will cause &quot;ecstatic
recall&quot;, and tempt people to relapse.  It
might.  It might also make some people extremely uncomfortable to
have to confront the real
reasons why they drank so much.  It might blow away the disease
myth, and leave people feeling
responsible for their actions.  So what?  Isn't a meeting
<i>supposed to be</i> a real good place to handle
such feelings?
Can you think of any better place to bring up and deal with such
feelings?
<p>
Aren't members of Alcoholics Anonymous supposed to &quot;grasp and
develop a manner of living which demands rigorous honesty&quot;?
Well, let's start developing some rigorous honesty about
the joy of drinking.
<p>

(Just as a side note, how can you get ecstatic recall if drinking was
never any ecstatic fun in the first place? You should get something
like yucky recall.)

<p>

I can't help but wonder whether being in denial about the joy of
drinking contributes to the standard A.A. behavior pattern of repeated
relapses.  The A.A. member is forced into the strange, unnatural
position of having to deny all of the fun he ever had drinking,
and just mope around and complain about how bad it
was. He is forced to
suppress all of the feelings that go along with the joy of
drinking:  He denies that it was fun.  He denies that he misses
it. He denies that he is grieving for a lost friend, and lost
good times. He denies that he feels deprived of all of the
joyous partying that he used to indulge in.
<b>He &quot;stuffs his feelings.&quot;</b> Then, when
enough pressure has built up inside of him, he explodes
into uncontrolled binge drinking. Finally, sick and ashamed,
having lost all of his dry time, he
crawls back to A.A. to repeat the cycle.
<p>
Does it really help alcoholics to hide from themselves the real reasons for
drinking?  Does being in denial
about the joys of alcohol make alcoholics any safer from relapse?
Or does it do just the opposite?
Does such denial leave
alcoholics defenseless, sitting ducks, when cravings and ecstatic
recall come along, and they
suddenly remember that alcohol was a whole lot of fun and really
felt great? (And then the dogma that we are powerless over alcohol
means that, theoretically at least, he cannot even try to resist
the cravings.)
<p>

It seems to me that really deciding to quit drinking involves
recognizing that one is balancing long-term benefits against
short-term benefits, and deciding which one wants more.  I can
get great short-term benefits from a fun drunken binge.  It
really might be a lot of fun to get high again,
to get righteously ripped, to buzz my brains out.
But the long-term effects of drinking (for me) are all horribly
negative: readdiction, blown liver, blown brain, sickness,
probable death. Not fun, not in the long run.
The only long-term benefits available to me come from not drinking.
So... we put
drinking on one side of the scale, and abstinence on the other
side, and weigh one against the other, and see where it balances
out... And I ask myself, <b>&quot;What do I really want?&quot;</b>
<p>
The Big Book, in the chapter &quot;To Wives&quot;, says:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We never, never try to arrange a man's life so as to
shield him from temptation. ... If he gets drunk, don't
blame yourself.  God has either removed your
husband's liquor problem or He has not. If not, it had
better be found out right away.
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, Page 120.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, that is as clear as it can be.  So why all of
this pussy-footing around, and trying to
avoid even mentioning the joy of alcohol?
<p>
Get over it, come off it, get real.

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>
<p>
Just as a side note, the A.A. refusal to speak about, or
really look at, the pleasure of drinking
alcohol reminds me of the Jewish religion's <i>Jahweh</i>,
He Whose Name we must
not speak out loud, or a Polynesian god, whom you must not look
at, else you will be killed for
your effrontery.  Is A.A. elevating alcohol to the status of a god?
In a way it does:  First, when
you are young, and things are going good, alcohol is the Magical
Spirit who takes you to Heaven.
Then things go bad, and alcohol takes you to Hell.  Then, after
you do enough time in Hell,
alcohol takes you to another Heaven: the world of A.A., where you
will find salvation and a
permanent abode in the home of another deity.  Where would you
end up if it weren't for
wonderful alcohol? You would be just another poor stupid slob
who didn't benefit from the
Twelve Steps.  Why, the ordinary, normal people out there can
only wish they were alcoholics or
drug addicts, so that they could get as close to God as we alkies
and dopers do.
<p>
There is actually a story in the Big Book where a non-alcoholic
is complaining about how boring his life is, and his A.A.-member friend
thinks:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You poor guy. I feel so sorry for you. You're not an alcoholic.
You can never know the pure joy of recovering within the Fellowship of
Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;
</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, page 334.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
It seems like, every time I try to be sarcastic or ironic,
they outdo me by being even crazier than I can imagine.
