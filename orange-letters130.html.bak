Subject:  	some interesting recovery forums<br>

<p>
Hey Orange,

<p>
Hope all is well with you. You may be interested in two rather heated forums which
have been the scenes of give and take between Dr's. Schwartz and Dombeck
(pro-AA'ers) and a host of other people who are sharing their views on the program.
What's interesting is that the two PhD's (I don't think they are M.D.'s) are
side-stepping posts which point to AA's failure to stand the test of scientific
inquiry.  Instead, these gentlemen continually retreat back into the anecdotal
argument that they know people who have been helped by the program.

<p>
The second link is of particular interest because Harriet Hall M.D. actually weighed
in asking for proof that AA works. She is known as the Skepdoc and has a web site
that deals with quack medicine.  She recently wrote an article about AA:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160814050154/http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=490" target="_blank">
http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=490</a>
<p>
I believe she did not know about your
web site before she wrote the article.

<p>
Here are the links to the forums:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160814050154/http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&amp;id=9527" target="_blank">

http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=weblog&amp;id=700&amp;wlid=5&amp;cn=14</a>

<p>
I think at this point that Dr's. Schwartz and Dombeck have been cornered by reason.
I would not be surprised if the forums are taken off line in the near future.

Subject:<br>

<p>
I don't know who you and I am not trying to argue with you but I feel you are dead
wrong about AA. What does it matter if how they quit drinking and drugging. They are
not a cult. A cult is a organization which states that they have thr truth..The only
truth to get to Heaven and to God. AA encourages people to get involved in &quot;a&quot; faith
or religion.
<p>
You should only be happy that these people stop doing drugs and no longer have the
need to rob you or your house to gettheir high. Also as jacked up as our nation is
surrounding anything having to do with Jesus and the Bible...they send people to AA
NA.
<p>
You sound very angry..unlike the people I have met AA. Maybe you could learn from
them on how to address your anger issues.
<p>
Good luck.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Flores,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
You are assuming things that are not true. In the first paragraph, you say,
<font color="black">&quot;What does it matter if how they quit drinking and drugging.&quot;</font><br>

And in the second paragraph you try to claim that A.A.
makes people get clean and sober:
<font color="black">&quot;You should only be happy that these people stop doing drugs and no longer have the
need to rob you or your house to gettheir high.&quot;</font><br>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous does not work to get people off of alcohol or drugs (or tobacco, either).
A.A. has a failure rate so high that the only people who quit drinking (or drugging)
are the ones who were going to quit anyway. We've been over this a zillion times before.
<a href="orange-letters127.html#tests" target="_blank">Look here</a> and
<a href="orange-letters128.html#ineffective" target="_blank">here</a>.
So there is no point in asking whether I'm glad that the addicts aren't robbing my house.
Neither A.A. nor N.A. deserve any credit for that.

<p>
You ask, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Well, I care. I care whether A.A. foists quack medicine and cult religion
on sick people and lies about its success rate.

<p>
Then there is your statement,
<font color="black">
&quot;A cult is a organization which states that they have thr truth.&quot;</font><br>
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">There is a whole lot more to a cult</a>
than just that one characteristic, but that description does fit A.A. just fine.
<p>
And Bill Wilson did claim to have &quot;the truth&quot;, and he did claim
to get people to Heaven. Bill declared that practicing the 12 Steps gave these results:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>There is a solution</i>. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; But we saw that it really worked in others....<br>
We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension
of existence of which we had not even dreamed.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
chapter 2, <i>There Is A Solution</i>, page 25.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I know that Bill Wilson often declared that A.A. is not a religion, but he was just lying.
Claiming that &quot;It's spiritual, not religious&quot;, is just a word game.

<p>
Then you finish with the standard A.A. put-down:
<font color="black">
&quot;You sound very angry..unlike the people I have met AA.&quot;</font>
<p>
Spoken like a well-indoctrinated A.A. member:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You axiomatically spiritually wrong if you
are angry or have a resentment&quot;</font>.<br>
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment" target="_blank">Look here</a>
for a list of other A.A. members who said the same thing before.

Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Dog&quot; <br>
Subject:  	I am proud to call you my new friend<br>

<p>
Dude! You are telling it like it is. Since we are going to be friends
(reciprocated or not) I'd like to tell you something about me. I am
the 30/60/90 day wonder. I've got six years of colored chips, but none any
higher than three months. Six years of working steps (evidently not hard
enough) and not a damn thing to show.
<p>
My last, and I do mean my very last
visit to AA was last Thursday. I went in ready and willing to drink
the Kool-aid once *again*. My wife has seen me fail at AA many times over
the past six years. This time I was ready to surrender (Just like last
time). But this time I just knew it would be different. I did a meeting on
June 5,6,7,8, 10, and 11. I missed the 9th and I think the one on the
seventh wasn't really an AA meeting. It was marked open meeting of AA but it
was mostly about drugs. Anyway... I noticed that I really felt compelled to
drink more when I was at the meeting than any other time. The drunkalogs all
had new faces attached to them. Same old poopie!
<p>
So let's get down to the
11th of June 2009. Got to the meeting early, had the usual coffee on the
porch, involuntarily smoked about ten cigarettes through passive inhalation
and received my packet of lovebombs from the newest crop of &quot;Keepers&quot; and
then took my chair. Blah blah blah!
<p>
I looked around and recognized a woman
from my past. We never had a relationship other than professional, but I
really respected her. She is beautiful and bright. I am happily married and
would never consider cheating, and that is not the problem in this
situation. It is a problem of respect. She is older than I am and she is
someone I respected very much outside of AA. She just happens to be a she.
As the meeting dragged on I noticed that every guy in the room was staring
at her like a t-bone steak complete with taters and gravy.
<p>
Then it happened.
Slowly but surely every drunk in the room &quot;tested the waters&quot; for the 13th
step with little verbal quips. She didn't shoot them down. She just
continued on with the pre-programmed one liners and slogans. &quot;..*by the
grace of God and the fellowship at AA I am alive today..*.&quot;.
<p>
I thought
about the incident a lot. I went to the store and got a case of Bud. Drank 12
on Friday, 12 on Saturday. I felt much better about the situation, not so
good about myself. I found your site on the web Sunday morning. I've read
through a ton of your material. I watched the Penn and Teller link and
downloaded it off You Tube. No friggin wonder &quot;I&quot; couldn't succeed. There
was no &quot;I&quot; left to make it to success. Your bottom line is that drink is a
choice. I have adopted your bottom line. I chose to drink the case of beer
this weekend. It was a bad choice. I don't have to choose that anymore. I am
*not* powerless over a bottle of beer. I am not powerless over my lizard
brain. I don't need a Nazi cult to keep me sober. I don't have a disease! I
have a CHOICE. I'm not putting you on a pedestal, though you are quite a
remarkable organizer of knowledge. I am putting knowledge on a
pedestal. Keep up the Great work!

<p>
PS. Love the pictures of the Geese. Please keep my address hidden. I really
don't need any hassles or name calling from the old home group.

Subject:  	hi there<br>

<p>
I came across your site by chance. I believe you are trying to help people
who may not need AA to stop drinking. I'm taking the time to write because I
respect that and think it is relevant, and I am a member of AA. I do not
know what experiences led you to the conclusion that all AA's believe that
AA is the only way for anyone to become sober, but I and the majority of
the other folks I know in AA understand that there are other paths and that
AA is not the only answer. We decided through self-identification that AA
may work for us, and over time became convinced that it will. So, please
accept that your opinion does not resonate for me or match my experience,
and I am actually in AA. If you can do that, you can accept that not all
AA's are as you describe.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Byron,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Starting at the top, you speak of &quot;people
who may not need AA to stop drinking.&quot; That implies that there are some people
who &quot;<i>do need A.A. to stop drinking</i>.&quot;
But who could that be when A.A. has a failure rate
so bad that it kills more alcoholics than it helps?
That is like speaking of &quot;those people who don't need Scientology to become sane.&quot;

<br>
That is a standard A.A. bait-and-switch trick. First, the story is,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;A.A. isn't the only way, we know only
a little...&quot;</font>
But later, A.A. <i>really is</i> the only way.
I discussed that before, in both the <i>Bait-And-Switch</i> tricks page,

and in <i>The Cult Test</i>,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_only_way" target="_blank">here</a>.

</font>
<p>
In my experience, AA is not about quitting drinking, but recognizing that
drinking is a faulty solution for other problems, both emotional and
spiritual. It is a *symptom* of the problem. The people who embrace AA do so
because they identify with this, not because they are brainwashed. As a
matter of fact, we are not allowed to try to convince anyone to join AA, it
is based on self-diagnosis. See tradition 11, 'attraction rather than
promotion'. In fact, no one can come to this program unless they have
decided to.

Wow. What a stream of standard slogans and misinformation.

<li>
<font color="black">

I agree with that statement.
A.A. is really a cult religion that pretends to have a working cure for alcoholism.
<br>
Unfortunately, a whole lot of people have been misled and fooled into thinking
that A.A. is about helping people to quit drinking. &#8212; Like the judges
who sentence people to A.A. meetings.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;...but recognizing that

Well yeh, but that is just a truism. You can go over to Over-Eaters Anonymous and opine
&quot;Eating is a faulty solution for your emotional problems...&quot;
That makes people feel guilty for being stupid, but how does it help them?

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;It is a *symptom* of the problem.&quot;</font><br>

No, actually it is the problem.
People may have other
problems, like mental problems like a Bi-Polar Disorder, or emotional problems like depression,
or whatever, but drinking deadly quantities
of alcohol is the first problem to cure, because that is the one that is killing them.

<p><li>
<font color="black">
&quot;The people who embrace AA do so because they identify with this,

Baloney. Prove that statement.
People who &quot;identify with&quot; A.A. are often the newcomers who
are being love-bombed and misled, and told,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;You are not alone. You are just like us. You have come home.&quot;

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is really over the top. Tradition 11 proves nothing except that Alcoholics Anonymous
is hypocritical. Of course A.A. is a program of promotion and coercion.
The last two triennial surveys done by Alcoholics Anonymous, Inc., showed that about
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">
two thirds of all of the A.A. members were originally coerced or forced or pushed into A.A.</a>
by the criminal justice system, &quot;counselors&quot; and &quot;treatment programs&quot;
and &quot;treatment centers&quot;, &quot;employee diversion programs&quot;,
family, or coworkers.
(<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">Click on that link</a>.)
<p>
And A.A. still encourages such coercion, and is complicit in it.
The A.A. headquarters euphemistically calls it &quot;cooperating with the courts&quot;.
<a href="orange-letters55.html#AA_cooperation" target="_blank">Look here</a> for quotes
from their position paper on the subject.

<p>
<a name="early_coercion"> </a>
And this is nothing new. A.A. has always been a program of coercion, ever since the
very earliest days of A.A.  Bill Wilson even bragged about how he and Dr. Bob bagged
&quot;A.A. Number Three&quot;, Bill Dotson, in the hospital.

The A.A.-council-approved history book <i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>
describes how Dr. Bob and Bill Wilson shoved their
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Oxford Group cult religion</a>
&quot;alcoholism treatment&quot; on Bill Dotson, when he was in
the hospital in Akron, Ohio:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
... they thought it a good idea to have a preliminary talk with his wife.
And this became part of the way things were done in the early days: Discuss
it first with the wife; find out what you could; then plan your approach.
It should be noted, as well, that the alcoholic himself didn't ask for help.
He didn't have anything to say about it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Dr. Bob and the Good Oldtimers</i>,
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc., 1980, pages 82-83.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob actually felt entitled to shove their own
cult religion on other alcoholics regardless of the patient's wishes or
beliefs &#8212; &quot;for his own good&quot; &#8212; the patient didn't get any
say in the matter. (That is still the attitude of many so-called counselors.)
<p>
Note that Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were actually recruiting for the Oxford Group cult
religion in Akron. &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; did not exist then, and
would not exist until four years later.
There was only the Oxford Group, so Bill Dotson was not
&quot;A.A. Number Three&quot; like Wilson said.
Bill Dotson was actually Oxford Group victim number ten-thousand or so.

A great many people stop drinking and live happily ever after without AA,
this is known fact. I wish I was one of them, but I am not. I have to work
to stay sober, because of the underlying emotional and spiritual maladies
that I drank to overcome. AA provides me with a plan of action that works &#8212; 
for me.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
the vast majority of people who successfully quit drinking do it without A.A. or
any &quot;program&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;</a>,
so I doubt that A.A. is really necessary for you either.
You just believe that it is necessary. That's
<a href="orange-letters3.html#Dumbo" target="_blank">Dumbo's Magic Flying Feather</a>
again...
(You know, Dumbo just couldn't fly without that magic feather...)
<p>
And the way that A.A. has convinced you that you drank because of
&quot;underlying emotional and spiritual maladies&quot; is really tragic
&#8212; it's just one more replay of the
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_fix_newcomers" target="_blank">you are defective</a>&quot;
broken record.

</font>
<p>
I have no stake in communicating with you and no expectation of a return.
But if you are open-minded enough to recognize that 'AA is not for
everyone', I am requesting that you could state on your website that there
are people in AA who agree with you (I would venture there are vast numbers
of people in AA who agree). Regardless, your characterization of all AA's as
believing that AA is 'the only way' is inaccurate, based on my own
experience.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You keep saying,
<font color="black">
&quot;AA is not for everyone&quot;</font>, which implies that A.A. must be for a bunch of other people.
The evidence does not support that assumption.
A.A. creates more problems than it solves.

A.A. increases the rate of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">increases the number of rearrests</a>,
and A.A. even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
while
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">failing to sober up the alcoholics</a>,
so who is it for?
<p>
I know that there are some A.A. members who say that A.A. is unsuitable for a lot of people.
Some of them even make up the
&quot;<a href="orange-letters30.html#Rescue_League" target="_blank">Newcomer Rescue League</a>&quot;,
and they go to A.A. meetings to
save the newcomers from bad sponsors and bad dogma and bad misinformation.

Obviously you are not an alcoholic. If you were, you would know that
rubbish about spontaneous recovery is nothing but pure
misinformation!!  I got sober at age 35, and have been continuously
sober for 8 years. 100% of the people that I know who work The Program
of AA have remained sober. 100% of those people tried many, many, many
times unsuccessfully to quit drinking alcohol and nothing else worked.

What a true and grave mistake you have made by publishing such junk.
I wonder just how many alcoholics have died after reading your paper

Not so. Alcoholics need more true and accurate information, not less.

Above all, I do not tell fellow alcoholics that there is no hope. I tell them just the opposite &#8212; 
that they can get sober like I did, and recover like I did,
and enjoy a life free of cults, just like I am doing.
<p>
It is Alcoholics Anonymous that tells alcoholics that they are powerless over alcohol,
and cannot ever recover. It is A.A. that tells them that they have no hope:

From:  	&quot;M M&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Need more of your voice<br>

<p>
Orange:

<p>
I have read over your papers and I am so thankful you can defy the AA
robotic way of life. I have (had) a friend who I use to occasionally drink with. She
3 years ago decided she was an alcoholic. Bear in mind, Orange, she was not. She
drank and was functional. She wanted to let people know she was &quot;real messed up&quot;. It
was all attention seeking.
<p>
I was having some problems in life: death of brother,
marital issues and I increased my drinking. She, of course decided I was an
alcoholic. I needed AA or lest I would be lost. She called my wife behind my back to
convince her I was a gutter drunk. I needed to be saved. The only way is AA. NOTHING
ELSE WORKS!!!
<p>
So my wife and her decided I needed AA. I went to these meetings and
felt real uncomfortable. These people are from another planet. Why do they go around
the room and basically force you to tell them your name. Where is the anonymity in
that? Hi, I am AL K HALL and I am forced to
be here.
<p>
Anyway, after going with this nutcase for a time, I convinced my wife I
was not a sot. I still drink but I believe it is situational, as is much of life.
<p>
These AA people called my house and told me they were the only way to serenity. AA
should realize most people that drink too much eventually cut back or stop on their
own. I very rarely drink the way I use to. I knew that I needed to cut back, so I
did. Of course, I am in denial. I can never be a &quot;social drinker&quot; after being a
heavy drinker. WHY NOT???
<p>
I want to let AA know I have my own steps I use to combat
the evils of alcohol. These have helped me remain a &quot;social drinker&quot;

<h3>My 12 Steps</h3>
</center>

<p>
1) Time... time does help heal the hurt and problems of life

<p>
2) Exercise.... AA probably thinks exercise is bad because it makes you feel good.
Endorphins are dangerous. Endorphin Anonymous anyone?

<p>
3) My children... my kids are great. Most members of AA I saw ignored their kids and
family for the good of the cult. I embraced my kids and they helped me get through a
bad time. If I would have taken the AA approach I would be taught to put my kids 2nd
or 3rd.

<p>
4) Music... music has a way to help a person understand life and its problems..

<p>
5) Jesus... I am not a holy roller but i regularly pray and read scripture. I talk
nightly to God. higher power???? only one higher power people.. GOD

<p>
6) Yardwork... I use my creativity and love to sculpt my lawn. I put on my ipod and
go crazy.  I do not drink while I am doing yardwork.  I GET A NATURAL ENDORPHIN
HIGH!!!

<p>
7) Movies... watching a good movie is a great way to escape without getting plastered.

<p>
8) Journaling... write down your thoughts, it helps. Why pay a shrink $100 to listen
and not really do anything. write down your thoughts, it is the same and cheaper!!

<p>
9) Travel... seeing new places gets one out of the normal routine. Seen that 1000
times. get out and go somewhere different, even if it is the next town over. Most
cities and towns have great stories and history behind them.

<p>
10) Sex... drunk sex is awful. sober sex is heaven... enough said

<p>
11) Golf... the ultimate mind battle.

<p>
12) Diet... people what you put in your mouth affects your mood and drinking habits.
go to any amusement park and just look at the eating habits of Americans. Eat a
healthy diet with whole grains, fiber and protein.

<p>
Orange my first time writing. I apologize for spelling and grammatical errors. I
hope people realize AA is NOT the way. I listed my 12 ways to combat heavy drinking
and I am sure there are 50 to 100 other ways. It is all personal. The point is, AA
is not going to do it. They say they will but I was lucky, I fought my way out of
the brain washing and did it on my own. Please people understand you can do it on
your own, it does take time but it will happen. THANKS

Hello MM,
<p>

own&quot;</font>.
Yes, although that unfortunately still leaves a lot of tragedies.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The Harvard Mental Health
Letter</a> reported,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Treatment of Drug Abuse and Addiction &#8212; Part III</i>,
<b>The Harvard Mental Health Letter</b>, Volume 12, Number 4,
October 1995, page 3.
<br>
(See Aug. (Part I), Sept. (Part II), Oct. 1995 (Part III).)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even a 55% recovery rate still leaves 45% dying of alcohol abuse &#8212; something
that A.A. has not fixed or improved in its 70 years of claiming to have &quot;the solution&quot;.
<p>
And then there is the problem of sorting out the alcohol and tobacco damage.
Most heavy drinkers are also heavy smokers, and more than half of the time, the tobacco
kills them before the alcohol does. So should the coroner count that as an alcohol or
tobacco death? And when someone drinks and smokes together, it makes
the health problems more than twice as bad because the two interact to make people even sicker.

<p>
The famous think tank called
&quot;The Rand Corporation&quot; did
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="_blank">a study of alcoholics</a>
where they found that half of the alcoholics who got sober did it by total abstinence,
and the other half by tapering off into moderate, controlled drinking.
Of course the A.A. organization screamed when that report was released.

<p>
Then there is the problem of
<a href="orange-letters126.html#definitions" target="_blank">defining just who is an alcoholic</a>.
A.A. is far too eager to label people alcoholics,
often because of just one problem incident, or even none.
(But then, when some of those people quit drinking without Alcoholics Anonymous
or its &quot;program&quot;, A.A. is just as quick to declare that they
were not
&quot;<a href="orange-letters35.html#real_alcoholic" target="_blank">real alcoholics</a>&quot;
after all.)
<p>
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-letters6.html#not_alcoholic" target="_blank">a letter that I received years ago</a>
from a young woman who went through
a divorce, and went into a real depressed funk for a while, and drank far too
much for three months, and ended up crashing her car.
So she was forced into Alcoholics Anonymous, where they told her that she was
an alcoholic for life, and &quot;in denial&quot;.
Apparently this went on for four years.
She finally discovered that she wasn't an alcoholic at all. So she has a few drinks
now and then, and that's about it.

<p>
A.A. obviously didn't &quot;help&quot; her at all. Nor did they help you.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Paul T.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Your website and your message.<br>

<p>
Dear good people,

<p>
I am a recovered addict that subscribes to the 12 Step Program of recovery
as outlined in the Big Book of Alcoholic Anonymous. Let me state that I have
gone on to read other literature in an endeavor to reach a higher
consciousness, a higher self, and at a minimum, to stay clean and sober.
Just recently, I have finished reading M. Scott Peck, M.D. books (The Road
Less Traveled, Further Along the Road Less Traveled, and People of The
Lie).  These books have had considerable impact on me; an impact to the
extent that I felt compelled to incorporate what I had learned into my
'speak' at 12 Step meetings. The intent may have been honourable and good
but the process was completely self-serving. Simply put, my existence and
participation in 12 Step meetings should be done in the context of the
'movement'. In other words, when in someone else's house, make the effort to
be cognizant of the traditions and the intent of the purposefulness of the
group. As I see it, the purposefulness of any group setting is to share &quot;Our
stories in a general way what we used to be like, what happened, and what we
are like now.&quot; From my many active years in Cocaine Anonymous, I believe
this is &quot;How It Works&quot;.

<p>
Much respect,
Paul T.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Starting at the end, you said,
<font color="black">
&quot;...I believe
this is &quot;How It Works&quot;.&quot;</font><br>
Well, belief is all fine and well, but that isn't
evidence that Cocaine Anonymous actually works to make addicts break their addictions
and get clean. It's the same problem as with Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; lots of &quot;faith&quot;
and &quot;belief&quot;, but woefully short on real results.
<p>
Then you said,
<font color="black">
&quot;...when in someone else's house, make the effort to
be cognizant of the traditions and the intent of the purposefulness of the
group.&quot;</font><br>
That is just another way of saying that
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_group_think" target="_blank">you should conform to the cult</a>.
You cannot contradict or criticize the slogans and misinformation and nonsense that the
old-timers are spewing at the meetings.
<p>
It seems to me that you should always tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth to the addicts and other sick people &#8212; the cult's dogma and &quot;program&quot; and
&quot;traditions&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot; be damned. Those things do not work and do not help
the addicts to recover.
<p>
If you believe that those things do make addicts recover, then let's see some numbers.
What is the actual cure rate of C.A., as evidenced by valid medical clinical tests,
like
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">Randomized Longitudinal Controlled Studies</a>?
Out of each thousand newcomers to C.A., how many get a year clean and sober?
Five years?
<p>
And how does that compare to the self-cure rate, where people quit doping and recover on their own?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I have to do it that way. I'm one of those people who has no success with moderation
when it comes to alcohol and tobacco.
Total abstinence is the only thing that has ever worked for me, but it works very well indeed.
<p>
Have a good day now.

I got sober in a rehab on Long Island in 1980 and have been sober since then.
I stay sober for myself and attend AA meetings for amusement.
When I am told GOD got me sober, I reply, &quot;If GOD got me sober then GOD got me drunk,&quot;
which ends the conversation.

<p>
Thank you for all you do.

My therapist pushed AA on me, so finally I went to a meeting.<br>
Pathetic. &nbsp; Hopeless. &nbsp; Demoralizing. &nbsp; Depressing. &nbsp; Useless. &nbsp; Hopeless.<br>
I left thinking, &quot;That is the great 12 step program?&quot;<br>
<p>
Next day I began
looking on-line, and happily I found you.  I don't drink, I never drink,
I have quit drinking, but not because of a support group.  Not &quot;one day
at a time.&quot;
<p>
Thanks again for all the help and information and
inspiration your site gave and gives me.

Spent a while on this one. I know it might offend a few, but contained
within are many of the reasons I began to challenge AA, continue to do so,
and always will.

<p>
The most powerful question is not whether I am right, which I may have been,
but instead why have I been silenced, bullied and ridiculed for daring to
question?

<p>
That simple inquiry rather gives it all away?

<p>
Los Angeles (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160814050154/http://www.prweb.com/" target="_blank">PRWEB</a>)
March 13, 2009 &#8212; The U.S. government just announced newly revised
guidelines, with the launch of its &quot;Rethinking Drinking&quot; website,
regarding the consumption of alcohol. </p>
<p>
The extensive site supports the concept of the viability of non-12 Step
programs to help people stop drinking. According to Marc Kern, Ph.D.,
this new approach is a long awaited and beneficial change in the way
the NIH (National Institutes of Health) approaches alcohol treatment
and recovery. </p>
<p>
&quot;Millions of people have been avoiding any sort of help for their
drinking because they weren't willing to embrace the ''black or white
notions&quot; that permeate the 12-Step program,&quot; Kern said. &quot;Now the
government is saying that there are effective options.&quot; </p>
<p>
Dr. Kern is a founding father of SMART Recovery, one of the alternatives included on the NIH Website.
</p>
<p>
For decades, problem drinkers have been steered exclusively to
Alcoholics Anonymous by state and local courts, and the prison system.
For many people the A.A. structure and belief system simply doesn't
work. </p>
<p>
&quot;In my opinion, countless people see their alcohol problems get worse
because they aren't willing to accept the powerlessness and religious
overtones of the dominant A.A. model,&quot; says Kern. </p>
<p>
SMART Recovery&reg; (Self Management And Recovery Training) teaches
individuals how to attain and maintain abstinence from addictive
behaviors (substances or activities). The program offers specific tools
and techniques for each of the program points: </p>
<p>
Point 1: Enhancing and Maintaining Motivation to Abstain <br>
Point 2: Coping with Urges<br>
Point 3: Problem Solving (Managing thoughts, feelings &amp; behaviors)<br>
Point 4: Lifestyle Balance (Balancing momentary &amp; enduring satisfaction)
</p>
<p>
SMART Recovery a free mutual-help group is consistent with the idea
that &quot;even heavy drinkers are able to change on their own&quot; according to
to Mark Willenbring, MD., director of NIAAA's Division of Treatment and
Recovery Research.
</p>
<p>The &quot;Rethinking Drinking&quot; site supports several other alternatives
stating, &quot;If one approach doesn't work, try something else. If a
setback happens, get back on track as quickly as possible. In the long
run, your chances for success are good.&quot; </p>
<p>
Dr. Kern is very encouraged by the updated NIH approach, stating that
&quot;This will finally give people a government sanctioned choice.&quot; </p>
<p>
Marc Kern, Ph.D. is a practicing addiction therapist who appeared on
20-20 and Larry King live among numerous radio and TV shows. He is a
Licensed Clinical Psychologist who uses cognitive therapy to help
people manage and overcome addictions. He came to his profession after
overcoming his own serious struggle with alcoholism. He is also
co-author of &quot;Responsible Drinking,&quot; among other publications.

Dr. Kern is available for interviews on the topic of addiction recovery alternatives.

<p>
Orange,

<p>
There was a movie called <i>Invincible</i> by the great film director Werner Herzog. It's
based on the true story about a muscle man named Zishe Breitbart who is Jewish who
becomes famous throughout Germany as the new samson. It features Tim Roth as Erik
Jan Hanussen who changed his name from Hersche Steinschneider.

<p>
Heres an IMDB link.

Hi Sherp,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I'll have to see that.
<p>
We have touched on
<a href="orange-rroot480.html#Hanussen" target="_blank">Erik Jan Hanussen</a>
before, and a book about him is
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hanussen" target="_blank">listed in the bibliography</a>.
Hanussen was a fascinating character &#8212; astrologer, 
&quot;seer&quot;, &quot;psychic&quot; and &quot;clairvoyant&quot; to Hitler and the Nazis.
And also their victim.

Have a good day.
