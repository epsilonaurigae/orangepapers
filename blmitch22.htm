<h3>
Threats by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Attempt Cutting Off a Member's
Right To Communicate with the Fellowship.</h3>
Even though AA's GSO in Germany lost part of the case relating to translations
other than German, they continue to harass and threaten not only the AA
member there and the group he belongs to (AA Big Book Study Group - BBSG),
AAeV (the German GSO) and AAWS have successfully threatened outside enterprises
in their attempt to bankrupt and destroy this AA member.
<p>&nbsp;The Big Book Study Group in Germany had a web site located on
the German subsidiary of America On-Line (AOL); they also had their e-mail
address there as well. In a letter dated August 12, 1999, from the German
GSO's lawyer (Frieder Roth) to AOL Bertlsmann Online, Ltd. &amp; Co. (German
AOL) he stated the following:
<p>&nbsp;"We represent Anonymous Alcoholics Interest Society, Inc., Munich
(AAeV). Additionally we are empowered by Alcoholics Anonymous World Services,
Inc. (AAWS) in New York." This means that this lawyer is acting on behalf
of, and with full permission of, both the German GSO and AAWS in New York.
The letter continues:
<p>&nbsp;"Our clients (AAeV and AAWS) are owners of exclusive rights in
the literary work ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, and its author is Bill Wilson."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Is the Copyright Valid?</h3>
The Big Book was copyrighted on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160604040424/http://../aaws/billreg.gif">April
10, 1939</a> by Bill and registered with the US Copyright Office in Washington,
DC. <a href="/web/20160604040424/http://www.orange-papers.org/aaws/billreg2.gif">April 19, 1939.</a> The validity of
this copyright is currently in question and until now has never been challenged
in a court of law. This may change.
<p>&nbsp;When the pre-publication manuscript (or so-called Multilith) was
published in February 1939 it contained the following statement on the
bottom of the <a href="/web/20160604040424/http://www.orange-papers.org/1939/manu/manu39.htm">Foreword page</a>:
<p>&nbsp;""This multilith volume will be sent upon receipt of $3.50, and
the printed book will be mailed, at no additional cost, as soon as the
book is published."
<p>And further it says on page 77:
<p>"To order this book, send your check or money order for $3. 50 to:
<center>The Works Publishing Company,&nbsp;
<br>17 William Street,&nbsp;
<br>Newark, N. J."</center>

<p>&nbsp;These statements show that the Multilith was sold to the general
public without any statement of copyright or copyright intent. It also
had no statement that the Multilith was a loan copy. According to a prominent
copyright attorney who was consulted in this matter, this means that there
was no legal copyright in effect and that the book was in the public domain
since February 1939. His legal opinion follows:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
A Legal Opinion</h3>
"In response to your question regarding publication of a work in the United
States under the 1909 Copyright Act without notice, please be advised that
this would inject the work into the public domain. Affixation of the notice
to publicly distribute copies was a condition to copyright protection under
the 1909 Copyright Act and also under the 1976 Copyright Act prior to March
1, 1989 when amendments became effective to conform to the Berne Convention.
As a general rule, copyright protection was forfeited if the notice was
not affixed."
<p>&nbsp;Even if there was a valid and legal copyright on the AA book,
AAWS allowed the 1st Edition copyright to lapse in 1967 and the copyright
on the 2nd Edition lapsed in 1983. Thus placing both editions in the public
domain forever.
<p>&nbsp;AAWS has always stated that their primary interest was in the
preservation of the integrity of the text. Despite the fact that the translations
and English version published by BBSG for free distribution worldwide held
to the original text and there was no loss of integrity, AAWS continues
to litigate against BBSG.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Property Rights</h3>
It has been proven that the current litigation is not about the integrity
of the text, but about the financial interests of AAWS. Frieder Roth's
letter to AOL continues:
<p>&nbsp;"For our clients, that book is of enormous importance for business
(note: economic value). Considerable parts of financial resources, which
are at the command of ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS for the good of alcoholic addicts,
come from sales revenues."
<p>&nbsp;AAWS is threatened by the free worldwide distribution of the Big
Book to those alcoholics who cannot afford to purchase them (including
those in European countries where their GSO's charge upwards of almost
$50 - US for each copy). Again, it is not about the integrity of the text
- it is about money and property.
<p>&nbsp;According to the book, TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS (12&amp;12),
"Then our Trustees wrote a bright page of A.A. History. They declared for
the principle that A.A. must always stay poor." (Page 165)
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Read the Manual</h3>
Despite its declaration of poverty, AAWS maintains an $11 million dollar
reserve and has probably over a million dollars in legal fees fighting
to maintain money and property. AA's Service Manual and Concepts for World
Service is perfectly clear in relation to litigation issues. It states
in the Twelfth Concept, Warranty Five the following:
<p>&nbsp;"To the minds of some AA's, 'guardianship' of the AA Traditions
implies the right and the duty on the part of the Conference to publicly
punish or sue every willful violator. But we could not adopt worse policy;
indeed such aggressive public acts would place the Conference in the position
of having violated one AA Tradition in order to defend another. Therefore
aggressive or punitive action, even in this area, must be omitted."
<p>&nbsp;AAWS states that Bill Wilson was the sole author of the Big Book.
How could this be possible when even Bill stated in AA Comes of Age that
he was more of an umpire than an author? It is widely accepted that Hank
P. was the author of the chapter, TO EMPLOYERS, and that the early fellowship
edited and changed the text both in New York and Akron. It was more of
a group effort than of any individual member - including Bill.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Printing Company Threatened</h3>
In order to gain a legal copyright in Mexico, AAWS had to submit documentation
proving authorship of the Big Book. Mexican law states that in order to
have a valid copyright of a work, there must be a living author. To circumvent
this legality, AAWS' documents show that Wayne Parks (then General Manager
of AAWS) was reported to be the sole author of the Big Book. How could
this be when they had already falsely stated that Bill was the sole author?
How could there be two sole authors even though Wayne was not a part of
AA in 1939?
<p>&nbsp;Getting back to Frieder Roth's letter to AOL comes the worst part
of this tragedy. In it he states:
<p>&nbsp;"The requests of my clients because of copyright infringement
are also directed against your company (AOL) as a provider of net services.
You must be seen as an interfering disturber, and therefore you are subject
to claims of my clients…you are assured that our clients will immediately
take legal action…" if AOL fails to remove all of BBSG's web sites and
e-mail accounts.
<p>&nbsp;AOL capitulated to the legal threat by AAWS and on Wednesday,
August 18, 1999, they dropped the BBSG accounts and they are no longer
available on the Internet through AOL. A similar letter by Frieder Roth
was sent to the printing company who printed the translations of the Big
Book by BBSG. They too capitulated and ceased printing the books scheduled
for free distribution. Thus for now, AAWS has succeeded in silencing BBSG
and removing them from carrying the message of recovery as does any other
AA Group - unless of course they choose to purchase high priced AA literature
(at a much higher price than is charged in the US).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Primary Target</h3>
If the litigation now in appeal is lost, they won't even be able to purchase
AA literature even at the higher price. One of the stipulations is that
they cannot purchase any AA or recovery literature, sell any AA or recovery
literature or give away any AA or recovery related literature. This will
effectively stop this AA group from carrying the message of recovery and
therefore, cease to exist.
<p>&nbsp;AAWS' primary target is to stop the free distribution of literature
to those who cannot afford it. Frieder Roth's letter states that:
<p>&nbsp;"Everybody can download the text of the work to his computer.
Besides this, people interested in the printed book are offered the possibility
to order it and get it via post office mail free of charge."
<p>&nbsp;AAWS did not - YET - go after any of the other sites on the Internet
who offers downloadable versions of the Big Book. They only, for now, attempt
to destroy this one site. Eventually, for purposes of money, property and
prestige, they will go after all Internet sites related to recovery that
threaten their financial and business entity. The availability of reading
the Big Book on-line is in jeopardy even as you read this.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Profit Motive</h3>
They have stopped AOL from hosting web sites, they have stopped a printer
from printing free books financed by 7th Tradition member contributions
and they will continue until they have control of everything AA members
read and/or see on the Internet and elsewhere. If these are not the actions
of a dictatorial government rather than a spiritual entity I don't know
what is!
<p>&nbsp;AAWS has proven by their actions that they are not attempting
to save the integrity of the basic text. They have proven that they are
all about money and property. They have proven that they are against carrying
the message of recovery to the still sick and suffering alcoholic unless
they can make money off of it.
<p>&nbsp;I, for one, do not wish to make money off of AA or the sick and
suffering alcoholic. I also feel just as strongly that AAWS should not
be about making money off of the still sick and suffering alcoholic. AA
should be self-supporting through member contributions and NOT literature
sales. AA should be a spiritual entity, founded upon spiritual principles
and not a business continued upon a profit motive. A profit motive at the
expense of the fellowship of AA in its attempt to carry the message of
recovery based upon the basic text.&nbsp;
<h3>
Give it Away</h3>
Even Ruth Hock, AA's first secretary stated in PASS IT ON (Bill's biography
published by AAWS) that <b>the book was always intended to be given away
free of charge after the initial expenses were paid off</b>.
<p>&nbsp;BBSG was just fulfilling that intent and has been stopped (for
now) by a business intent on profit and control. Others will take up the
printing and distribution of free literature to those who seek recovery.
When they are <a href="/web/20160604040424/http://www.orange-papers.org/motorest/thiel-en.htm">forced into bankruptcy</a>
by AAWS, others will take their place.
<p>&nbsp;There are those in AA who still believe that profit should never
be a motive in AA recovery despite the fact that AAWS is only interested
in profit and that the integrity of the text is not in question in this
case. Our way of life should be available to ALL who seek it, not only
those who can afford to buy books.&nbsp;
