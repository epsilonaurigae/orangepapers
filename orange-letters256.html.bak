Hi Orange

<p>
Hope all is well. I came across this and thought you might be interested. It's a
constant source of irritation and amazement to me that people will discuss things
without making any effort at checking things out first.

<p>

<p>
I know that this site is about exposing the 12 step nightmare but I wondered if you
had any other research projects on? Also wondered what you think about an even
greater hoax than AA; namely, the moon landings. Do you think they were real? Also,
the war on terror? Is it necessary? I understand if you don't wish to answer, it's
just that your take on things has become of immense interest to me since
discovering your site.

<p>
All the best

Hello AnythingbutAA,
<p>
Thanks for the questions. And yes, I am well. And it's summer here, finally.
<p>
 About the SoberRecovery web site: Yes, they are well known as hard-core
Steppers. Many people have written to me complaining that they were banned from the forum for
saying things that the true believers didn't want to hear.

<p>
Not only does SoberRecovery not bother with facts, they don't bother with logic either.
Don't you love the reply that dismissed the Orange Papers by saying that some crazy guy said
similar things 10 years ago?
Let's see, what is that, besides
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#association" target="_blank">Guilt by Association</a>,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank">Assuming Facts Not In Evidence</a>,
and implied
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem" target="_blank">Ad Hominem</i></a>?
<p>
Notice that nobody said whether the crazy guy was correct.

<p>
But, that's what passes for intelligent discourse in cults.
Those Steppers aren't really any different from Scientologists or Moonies or Hari Krishnas
sitting around praising their favorite cult, and dismissing everybody else as wrong
and crazy.

<p>
Here is another link to another interesting SoberRecovery discussion:
<a href="orange-letters137.html#SoberRecovery" target="_blank">Is AA a cult?</a>
<p>
Now about your other questions:
<p>
<ul>

<li> I believe that the moon landings were for real. It's amazing what you can do with
high technology if you are also just very, very lucky and not too many things blow up on you.
(Remember that 3 guys did die when their capsule caught on fire on the ground during a training
exercise, and another 3 guys almost died in the Apollo 13 mission when a tank blew up.)

<p>
<li> The war on terror? A fraud and a hoax. First off, it's very bad wording. You can't wage a war
against an emotion. You might as well try to wage a war against love or
hate or jealousy or vanity or greed or ambition... 
<p>
Then, what is really happening is George Bush invaded the wrong country, Iraq, and wasted a couple of
trillion dollars and thousands of American lives and about a million Iraqi lives, and ruined both
Iraq and the reputation of the United States. And now Barack Obama has made the mistake of continuing the war
in Afghanistan. Bush's logic behind invading Afghanistan was to get the guys who brought down the
World Trade Center. But those guys immediately ran to Pakistan. They aren't in Afghanistan, and
haven't been for many years. The Seals just found and killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, didn't they?
And Osama was living comfortably with multiple wives in a large house just a mile down the road from the
Pakistani national military academy. Very strange, yes?
And nobody knew nuthin'?

<p>
Before 9/11, the Al Qaeda operatives who hijacked the airliners and crashed them into the World
Trade Center and the Pentagon were actually living in Germany and Florida and Arizona and
other places like that.
Does anybody want to invade and bomb Florida for hosting terrorists?
Now, Al Qaeda has moved on to places like Yemen and various African countries.  Chasing Al Qaeda is
a game of Whack-a-Mole that cannot be won by invading and occupying countries. Countries are fixed targets,
but Al Qaeda is a moving target. It is guerilla warfare, played on a global scale.
And so far, we are no more winning that war than we did the war in Vietnam, and for basically
the same reasons. You cannot fight a conventional war against a guerilla army, and you cannot
pacify the local population with bombs.
<p>
It is painfully obvious that both Iraq and Afghanistan will blow up in civil war just as soon as
the U.S. Army leaves. And everybody at the top knows that, and they just don't want to
see the end, or have it happen on their watch,
so they keep dragging it out and yammering ridiculous slogans like
&quot;When they stand up, we will stand down.&quot;
They are likely to stand up, all right, and shoot the last Americans leaving.

<p>
In addition, the &quot;War on Terror&quot; is really wrecking American law. Old Gestapo and KGB practices have
now become &quot;legal&quot; in the USA. American citizens can be spied on, wire-tapped, and then disappeared in
the middle of the night and shipped to secret prisons (which may be in foreign countries), and
held for years without trial or charges or a lawyer, and even tortured into confessing. That isn't the
America that I grew up in. When did the Nazis take over America?

</table></center>
<p>
We have been through this before. During World War II, the US government made the mistake of putting many
of the American people who had Japanese ancestry in concentration camps. (They didn't put the Germans
on the East Coast in camps, just the Japanese on the West Coast.)
People who had Japanese parents or grandparents suddenly had no civil rights, and the Bill of Rights
didn't apply to them. People now admit that was a big mistake and a violation of American principles.

<p>
But it's happening again. Now, you don't even need to have 
Arab parents. All that is required for you to disappear is for some misinformed
bureaucrat to fear that you might do something.

<p>
If you want to know what terrorizes me, it's the fact that Pakistan has about 30 atomic bombs and
is full of fundamentalist religious nutcases who have no problem with starting a nuclear war by
hitting Tel Aviv and New York.
Some of those nutcases imagine that they will immediately go to Heaven and have 60 virgins if they
get vaporized in a nuclear halocaust.
The Pakistani secret service, the ISI, is riddled with 
religious fundamentalists who are sympathetic to Osama's gang. So is their military.
And the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are just encouraging and empowering those radicals.
Yeh, that's what bothers me. And can you believe that the USA gives Pakistan hundreds of millions
of dollars in &quot;military aid&quot; each year, and calls Pakistan an ally in the war on terror? 
<p>
With friends like them, who needs enemies?
</ul>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

I got sober with Alcoholics Anonymous. Nineteen months later, I need a
simple answer; where do I go from here?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Matthew,
<p>
Thank you for the question, and congratulations on your sobriety.
That's really either a very simple question, or a very complex question,
depending on just what you mean by that. I'm not sure which it is.
<p>
First off, I'll try the simple approach: Where you go from here depends on what you want to do
with your life.
<p>
In my case, I chose to go down to the river and feed the cute little fluff-ball goslings.
But that's just my choice. That's just what brings me joy.
Other people will choose other things. Different strokes for different folks.

<p>
On the other hand, perhaps you meant the question to ask what kind of therapy or program you should
do next to stay sober.  I don't know you personally, but in general, there is no need to do any program
to stay sober. You just don't drink any alcohol. You don't need a meeting or a group or a cult religion
to tell you not to drink alcohol. By now, I think you know that alcohol is bad for you.

<p>
But if you really must have a meeting or a group, there are many of them that are less harmful than
A.A.
<a href="orange-letters250.html#alt_list" target="_blank">Here is the list of addresses</a>.

<p>
Or perhaps you wanted some discussions of hints and kinks and techniques for staying sober. Okay,
we've done that one too. Look here:

I am defending an organization that you can leave any time Jerk. The only

deal with you character defects. I'm sorry AA couldn't help you. That

Hello again, James,
<p>
You keep on harping on that line about &quot;you can leave at any time.&quot; That doesn't make an
organization good. You can also leave the Ku Klux Klan at any time. Or the American Nazi

<p>
And it is not true that people can leave Alcoholics 
Anonymous at any time.
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">Lots of people get sentenced to A.A. by a misguided judge</a>
or parole officer.
And treatment centers also routinely force people into A.A. meetings.
Those people are not free to leave.

<p>
The reason that A.A. couldn't help me is because A.A. is a fraud, just another cult religion,
that doesn't help people much at all.
If you want to be &quot;honest with yourself&quot; now, why don't you tell us what the actual A.A. success rate

By the way, speaking of pen names,
did you know that Ann Landers was not her real name? Most of the time, Eppie Lederer wrote

This is great stuff.  I feel elated and euphoric from reading  it.  I did a
quick scan of some of the text and quickly concluded that this  bears a
closer read and study just to understand my own reaction, i.e., my  feelings of
emotional and psychological liberation that I get from the  text.  Being an
on again off again imbiber/abuser since the sixties, I  can appreciate the
thinking and insights at you have invested in this  O.  It gives me the
power to face my senior years sober, strong, and  optimistic about the rest of
my life knowing that there is a helpful view out  there from people who have
successfully cut through so much of the bullshit in  our culture and our
lives and are willing to share their insights with others.  It has already
given me relief from the confusion from the point of view  that AA has foisted
on us all and addictive drinking.

<p>
So, thanks for opening the window and shining the light.  I will  bask at
night in this light to gain more insight.  It makes  wonderful bedtime
reading because it is so humorous and relaxing. It has been  lulling me to sleep
with a smile on my face for 2 nights.  I have been  rising from my sleep in
morning eager to meet the new day and anticipating  the night when I'll find
one more insight.

Subject:  	addiction and AA<br>

<p>
Dear Orange:
<p>
I read some of your deconstruction of Bill W's beliefs, and am a little perplexed.
For starters, by now many millions of people have gotten and stayed sober through
AA. Of those, many never smoked and many quit smoking after being sober for some
months or years. Yes it is certainly true that Bill W and many others struggled with
addictive issues the rest of their lives. Would you have preferred that they die
drunk many years earlier and so avoid that struggle? That's what I'm hearing.
<p>
AA in the 80s recognized as a Fellowship how destructive smoking was and made many
meetings smoke-free; many members after watching their elders die of awful diseases
quit. But don't you feel you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater? If even
one drunk gets to stop for good being a slave to the bottle, isn't that a good
thing?
<p>
I've been sober 15 years, don't smoke, and hardly go to meetings. But I know that AA
saved my life; without it I'd have been dead a long time ago.

In fact, A.A. makes things worse by

<p>
Oh, and A.A. does not even have two million members in the whole world, drunk or sober, so you can forget about
that &quot;many millions&quot; number.

<p><li>
Most alcoholics smoke. In fact, the situation is so bad that the tobacco usually kills more of them
than the alcohol does.

<p><li>
It's nice that the A.A. organization has started having smoke-free meetings. But they won't take
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson's rationalizations for smoking</a>
out of the <i>Big Book</i>, now will they?

<p><li>
It is not a question of whether I wish Bill Wilson had died of alcohol addiction or tobacco addiction.
A.A. is still a failure and quack medicine that is hurting more alcoholics than it is helping.
<p>
The fact that A.A. didn't help Bill Wilson or the other alcoholics to quit their tobacco addictions at all
is significant.
An old cult religion from the nineteen-thirties is simply not a cure for addictions.
<p>
Can you explain how the old Oxford Group cult religion routines of
self-criticism and confessing and praying and meeting attendance could
possibly work to make alcoholics quit drinking, but not work to make smokers quit smoking?

<p><li>
You assume that A.A. somehow made you quit drinking and saved your life.
There is no reason to believe that when the
vast majority of people who go to A.A. do not quit drinking. The truth is, you chose to quit drinking in order
to improve your life, and then you did it. Congratulations. The fact that you have 15 years of sobriety
now and do not go to A.A. meetings shows that A.A. is actually unnecessary.

Hi Orange:
<p>
Well I'm not sure why you're so ticked off at AA. I personally know many many people
with longterm(more than twenty years) sobriety. So it worked for them. And I know
maybe two or three who stopped without AA. So I think from my experience of
attending meetings in many parts of the country and seeing these things firsthand
that you are misinformed. I am sorry that this whole subject gives you so much pain.

Hello again, Amy,
<p>
The reason why I am &quot;so ticked off&quot;, as you call it, about A.A. is because it is a despicable crime
to foist quack medicine on sick people and lie to them about how well it works.

<p>
The fact that there are some people who hang around at A.A. meetings and claim 20 years of sobriety
does not prove that A.A. or the 12 Steps work to make people quit drinking.
That is the same bad logic as saying that a bunch of girls went to church for 20 years, and then
got pregnant, so going to church makes girls get pregnant.
<p>
(Even if the girls fervently insist that the church made them get pregnant, I'm not going to believe it.)

<p>
To figure out whether &quot;it worked for them&quot;, as you say,
you have to count all of the people who came to A.A. seeking help in quitting drinking:
those who successfully quit, those who
didn't quit, those who repeatedly relapsed, and those who soon dropped out. Also, those who merely pretend
to be sober while 13th-Stepping the pretty girls and women.
Also those who committed suicide.
And those who were told by a bad sponsor not to take their medications, and ended up in a hospital or dead.

<p>
Once again, I'm going to ask the question that no true-believer A.A. member has ever answered honestly.
Can we please have some of that famous A.A. &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;?

And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a>.)
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
Also, you should read the file
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>
before you claim that A.A. works.

<p>
Then you said,
<font color="black">
&quot;And I know maybe two or three who stopped without AA.&quot;
</font><br>
No joke. How could you know any? They don't come to A.A. meetings, do they? Where do you go to
meet people who quit drinking without A.A.?

<p>
By the way, add me to that list of yours. I have 10 years of sobriety now without A.A.
Also 10 years off of drugs and cigarettes.
No 12 Steps. No fascistic cult religion. No meetings.
No nonsense. I just decided that I was not going to die from alcohol or tobacco.

<p>
Lastly, you said,
<font color="black">
 &quot;I am sorry that this whole subject gives you so much pain.&quot;
</font><br>
It isn't my pain that matters, it is those who are still suffering at the hands of A.A.
The people whose lives are on the line.
People who want help in quitting addictions, and get lied to:

<p>
Very good definition of cults. I'd put it more succinctly:
Abdicate self-responsibility and all judgment. Give lots of money. Do what
you're told: &quot;Drink the green Kool-aid(tm).&quot;

<p>
You give no opinion on Christianity that I noted. Is that a cult? Matt,
Mark, Luke, John, 1 Corinthians 7:24 et al. Also Micah 6.8, note the word
&quot;humbly&quot; and the context.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Private Party,
<p>
Thanks for the letters and the questions.

<p>
Christianity is far too large and varied to be judged as one thing.
There is no one church &quot;Christianity&quot;.
<p>
Some sects of Christianity are undoubtedly cults:
<ul>
<li>
Here in Portland, Oregon, we have some nutcases who call themselves
&quot;The Church of the Followers of Christ&quot;, who do not believe in going to doctors and
using modern medicine. They only believe in prayer and faith healing. Every few years they
kill another child by not taking the child to the doctor when the child is sick.
Two parents were just convicted of manslaughter, and the trial of another pair is coming up.
<p>
<li> Then there is the FLDS &#8212;  Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints &#8212;  who exile the boys so that
50-year-old men can marry the fourteen-year-old girls as their third and fourth wives.

<p>
<li> Then there is that church in Atlanta Georgia that believes in spanking and beating the children
in church.
<p>
<li> Then there are things like the Branch Davidians, led by the Wacko from Wako,
&quot;David Koresh&quot;, and Rev. Jim Jones' People's Temple, both of
which were &quot;Christian&quot;, by a loose definition of Christianity.
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand, there are many very sensible Christian Churches that are not narrow-minded and
dogmatic. The Unitarians come to mind. I've also met very sensible Baptists, too.
Just a few nights ago, I was listening to Jane Fonda talking about getting a
religious education from Jimmy Carter and Andrew Young.
Those guys are not simple-minded moronic cult members.

</font>
<p>
Booze and AA: How come every (?) judge in the US will let off a first
offender off if he/she hits 20 AA meetings? Are all judges stupid, or does
the program work if you work it?

<p>
<font color="blue">
It's a lot of things. Many judges are misinformed. Others are lazy, and take the cheap and
easy solution that A.A. offers. Others are actually secretly members, trying to grow their
favorite religion.
<p>
But your statement that &quot;every judge&quot; will sentence people to
A.A. is obviously a false over-generalization.
It is in fact now illegal to force people into the A.A. religion.

</font>
<p>
The Hunger Project was not founded by Werner, only by a few est graduates.
Who decided to take responsibility for their world. Werner blessed it later.
Much the opposite of abdicating responsibility. It was NEVER intended to be
about dropping of a can of soup at Safeway(tm) so as to feel good, it was
and is about conscientiousness-raising. &quot;Everybody&quot; knew in 1977 that the
world can't feed itself, so toss 'em out of the lifeboat. In 2011,
&quot;everybody&quot; knows the world can feed itself, maybe probably. We- I joined in
1979, they reached me in Iran- set a goal in 1977 of world IMR* of 50 by
1997, (changed to year 2000 to be compatible with other organizations around
1979). World IMR, as of 2009 is 63, down from 133 or so in 1977. As world
population grew from 4 billion to 6.5 billion. The least-reported miracle
since Jesus made the wine. (So we're 13 short and 9 years late, sue me.)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, so now you reveal your agenda!
<p>
Do you have some secret information not known to the general world?
I've read a couple of detailed, well-researched books about &quot;Werner Erhard&quot; (really, Jack Rosenberg),
and none reported your story about how Werner merely &quot;blessed&quot; the Hunger Project.
What they said is that he stole $65 million out of the mouths of babies, and used
the Hunger Project to steer more people into his cult, and suck more money out of them
by requiring them to all get his &quot;training&quot;.
So show me your documentation.  What are your sources of information?

<p>
What you call &quot;consciousness-raising&quot; is an excuse for giving nothing to the hungry people.
The Hunger Project &quot;raised consciousness&quot; by keeping all of the money and spending a lot on
publicity, and doing nothing to actually feed the hungry.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
From the very outset of the Hunger Project, [project director Joan]
Holmes herself made it clear that the program had much more to do
with spreading the transformational message of est than with
actually doing anything to end hunger. Hunger, as Holmes candidly
told readers of the <i>Graduate Review</i> in August 1977, had
little to do with the overall goals of the project. &quot;Of course,
I'm not insensitive to the people who are hungry and starving,&quot;
said Holmes. &quot;But the truth is that it could be any issue.
The process is the same.&quot;<br>

for the voiceless,&quot; the est-influenced Harper admitted that
&quot;we don't send one grain of rice but we support those who are.&quot;<br>

<p>
So they set a goal of lowering the Infant Mortality Ratio? And just how did they plan to
do that? Publicity? Aiming TV cameras at sick and starving babies, and exhorting people to
give more money to Werner Erhard, which will be used for more publicity?

<p>
Please tell me precisely and exactly what you did to allegedly lower the infant death rate, and
where and when.  And how much money did you spend doing it?
<p>
You have presented some numbers where you claim that the infant death rate has declined, but
you have not presented any evidence that it has anything to do with your activities.
That sounds so much like American arrogance where Americans go to foreign countries
and tell the local people what to do, and if some things do get better,
the Americans assume that they are the cause of the improvement.
As if the Iranians were incapable of improving their
own medical care and hygiene after they threw out the Shah and got control of the oil money.

<p>
When the heat got to be too great &#8212; when there was a good chance
that &quot;Werner Erhard&quot; would be indicted for fraud and grand theft,
he sold his operation to one of his women followers and fled to Europe,
taking the money with him.  The last I heard, he was living a life of
luxury in Europe and enjoying his ill-gotten millions.

<p>
Werner Erhard is gone, but his racket is still continuing under the names
&quot;The Forum&quot;,
&quot;The Landmark Forum&quot;,
&quot;The Landmark Educational Forum&quot;,
and
&quot;Landmark Educational&quot;.
They like to specialize in so-called &quot;corporate training&quot;.<br>

So now you are going to try to tell me that Werner Erhard was wonderful, and he saved millions
of children or something?

Have a good day now.

<p>
dont know what united way is doing now. in retrospect and thinking  about how aa
brainwashed the judiciary system i'm not surprise united way got on the aa band
wagon too. the halfway house i stayed in for six months  was supported by the united
way. to stay there also required so many meetings a week. i think it was three. now
i'm like Yeah united way. i could write a book about staying in the halfway house
that united way supported. United Way wouldnt like it.
<p>
as  far as kids going to aa i
think they should have to be 21. i so feel for the parents of these children. they
are very vulnerable too. the kids  should at least be the legal drinking age to be
required to go to aa.
<p>
 the halfway house where i lived was administrated by people
who still drank. it was rumoured that the mens half way house was also administrated
by a person who still was drinking . and the wierdest thing was that the halfway
where the men stayed in was one building a way from the teens halfway house.  my
daughter was a teen when i was at the halfway house. she went to some aa meetings
with me. she felt uneasy because the men paid too much attention to her.
<p>
but the
point i was trying to make in the last email was that united way also supported aa. i
guess what im also saying is the doctors, rehab centers, halfway houses and of course
united way all were so brainwashed by aa. i depended on these people. i hope that
family members of a person who is a problem drinker will use critical thinking when
sending their problem drinker to a rehab center, or  halfway house, etc. i actually knew
a person who loved to go to rehab to connect. like it was a dating game. be careful.
please.

Hi again, Vicki,
<p>
Yes, A.A. has fooled a lot of people for a long time. But hopefully, we will get the word out.
Progress is slow, but it's coming.
<p>
Your stories about the halfway houses echo so many other stories that I've heard.
It strikes me as some special kind of idiocy to imagine that someone who just quit a
nasty addiction is qualified to supervise other people and tell them how to live their lives.

<p>
And I totally agree that nobody should be sending teenagers to A.A. or Al-Anon or Alateen or 
anything like that.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Somewhere an alcoholic read your little &quot;expose&quot; and decided that AA was bullshit.
Why do you attack an organization that has saved hundreds of thousands, if not
millions of lives? You're article is very ugly and you should be ashamed of

Hello Chris,
<p>
No, Alcoholics Anonymous has not saved thousands or millions of lives. In fact, A.A. doesn't
work at all. A.A. just raises the death rate in alcoholics. That was established by
one of the leaders of A.A.,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Trustee Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant</a>.

<p>
So steering people away from A.A. will save some lives. So I'm killing your imaginary
people while saving real people. Hey, that's a trade I'll make any day.
<p>
By the way, the claim that I'm harming alcoholics by telling the truth about quackery

<p>
In regards to your paper you typed up on the internet, I have a question for you.

<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html</a>

<p>
How do you explain the more than two million members worldwide, with no leaders, who
have recovered, asshole?

<p>
AA works, you don't

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the question. And the answer is very simple: There are no two million people recovered in
A.A. That standard A.A. claim is a lie. Period. A total lie. First off, A.A. does not even have
two million members in the whole world.
The membership is under two million, and declining.
Then, the majority of the A.A. members are not continuously sober.

<p>
In fact, the majority of the people whom A.A. claims as members are just visiting, and they
will be gone real soon.
<a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">A.A. has a huge churn rate</a>.
Newcomers in, newcomers gone. 95% of the newcomers
are gone in a year. Counting them as members, and claiming that they are sober because of A.A.,
is fraud.

<p>
There are only a few hundred thousand hard-core long-term A.A. members who may have
 multiple years of sobriety.
Those are the people who got themselves sober by using their own will power and
determination, and then got fooled into believing that A.A. did it for them.
Those people would have gotten themselves sober anywhere, including the local Tiddly-Winks Society.
<p>
Then there are other A.A. members that are something else, like sexual predators.
Many of them are not sober; they just pretend to be sober in order to sponsor the young.
Similarly, other oldtimers enjoy the status of having lots of <i>Time</i>, and they
would never admit to backsliding.

<p>
In fact, I find it funny that A.A. goes on and on about how bad alcoholics really are,
and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">how much they lie and
how dishonest and <i>in denial</i> they are</a>,
and yet, when it comes to the question of whether A.A. members are really sober, nobody questions
their word when they claim years of sobriety on A.A. triennial surveys.
Nope, an alcoholic would never fib about his sober time on a survey.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange,

<p>
&quot;I was very disturbed to read some letters on
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221739/http://www.soberrecovery.com/forums/" target="_blank">the sober recovery page</a>.
They actually
encourage the break up of marriages and relationships if the spouse or partner is
not in aa. I am now separated from my husband of 20 years.  Guess what? He's been in
aa for 11 months ... Go figure&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jeannine,
<p>

Yes, it really is insidious. A bunch of people who failed at managing
their own lives want to run other people's lives and tell them to end
their marriages? Where is that at?
<p>
P.S.: I'm sorry to hear about your husband. That is just such typical
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_separatism" target="_blank">cultish separatism: social isolation</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_enemy" target="_blank">enemy-making and devaluing the outsider</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_a7.html#ca_scapegoating" target="_blank">scape-goating</a>.
Only cult members are good enough, they say.
Outsiders are worthless and should be discarded before they make you
drink, the cult members say.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day, if you can.

I know but I will just be really, really mean and not rational.  Best to stay away
for now.  Those sickos really caused me and others a lot of harm ya know what I

too much.

Enjoy the sunshine and the geese.  :)  I overlook a pond at my new apt.  I have so
many birds around here I am going to get a bird feeder and a beginners guide to
feeding and learning about birds.  I love animals.  Hope my cats behave themselves,
haha.

Hello again, Jennifer,
<p>
I agree with your decision to just not go to A.A. meetings. When those meetings and associating
with those people causes you such unhappiness and puts you into such a bad mood, why bother?
<p>
Oh, and I don't think you are being mean.
That decision certainly does not sound irration, either. It's actually common sense. If something
causes you pain and unhappiness, then stay away from it. Simple.

<p>
I forget what country you are in, but you might want to think about some SMART or SOS meetings or something
like that. There, you can get companionship without irritating cult routines.
<a href="orange-letters250.html#alt_list" target="_blank">Here is the list of addresses</a>.
<p>
Coincidentally, I just found a bunch of bird feeders at Goodwill, and jumped on them. Both the seed feeders
and hummingbird feeders. The first thing to do is hang them up high, where the cats and dogs cannot
get the birds as they feed.
You can hang them from a tree branch, or any part of a building that has the right overhang.
Shade is good for the hummingbird feeders, so that the sugar-water doesn't overheat in the noonday sun, and
grow lots of algae.

<p>
Have a good day now.
