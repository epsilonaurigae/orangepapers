The goslings are gathering around Sam, who is laying on a towel.

The goslings really took a liking to Sam. They cuddled up to her a lot.
I'm not sure, but I suspect that they sensed that she
was the only female among the three of us. I doubt if goslings that young can tell human sexes
just from sight, but I think that they might have smelled female hormones or pheromones on a subliminal
level. As in, there was just something about Sam that reminded them of their first mother.
And Sam was very, very pregnant when this picture was taken, so she was loaded with female hormones.
<p>
So they sniffed me, and then they sniffed Sam. Then they sniffed me, then they sniffed Sam.
Then they said, &quot;We want Mama.&quot;
<p>
Either that, or they just liked her vibes.

Subject:  	AA Research Query<br>

<p>

Dear Orange

<p>

I am in the process of wading through your website &#8212; I doubt I will ever be
finished.  I started printing some of it and soon gave that up as I'm sure the
entire contents would leave several rainforests looking like deserts.

<p>

Anyway, you have a wealth of information on studies that have been carried out into
the effectiveness of treatment for alcoholism in the last few decades, including and
excluding the effectiveness of AA.

<p>

I cannot find anything about similar research that has been carried out in the UK,
which is where I live.  It's all from the US.  I am currently compiling a list of
contacts for various agencies in the UK to ask them specifically &#8212; what research
have they done or do they know about in the UK that studies the effectiveness of
different forms of treatment for alcoholism, including treatment in AA.

<p>

I'm contacting you directly to ask if you know of any such research.  I am still a
&quot;member&quot; of AA, sober for over 16 years, and with the predictable history of mental
illness and emotional instability since joining AA that I can now see is standard
rather than exceptional.  I am now married to an amazing woman, with two amazing
children and in a good job (that I am currently not doing while I write this!).  I
would love to tell you more of my story to include on your website but, for now,
could you just help with this query, if possible?

<p>

What is there here in the UK?  Is there anything?  Where do I find it??

<p>

Much appreciated,<br>
Gary.

Hello Gary,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I know of just one good, medically-valid, study that was done in the UK &#8212; near London.
It is the Orford and Edwards study of A.A.-based treatment.
It was one of the biggest, longest, most expensive, and best tests of Alcoholics Anonymous-based treatment ever done.
<p>
Doctors Orford and Edwards did a true randomized test where 100 alcoholics
got one of these two treatments for alcoholism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<ol>

<li>
For subjects in one group (the &quot;advice&quot; group), the only formal
therapeutic activity was one session between the drinker, his wife,
and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist told the couple that
the husband was suffering from alcoholism and advised him to
abstain from all drink. That was the entire &quot;treatment&quot; &#8212; one hour, one time.

<p>
<li>
Subjects in the second group (the &quot;treatment group&quot;) were offered
a year-long program that began with a counselling session,
an introduction to Alcoholics Anonymous, and prescriptions for
drugs that would make alcohol unpalatable and drugs that would
alleviate withdrawal suffering. Each drinker then met with a
psychiatrist to work out a continuing outpatient treatment program,
while a social worker made a similar plan with the drinker's wife.

</ol>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Twelve months after the experiment began, both groups were
assessed.
No significant differences were found between the two groups.
Furthermore, drinkers in the treatment group who stayed with it
for the full period did not fare any better than those who
dropped out. At the twelve-month point, only eleven of the
one hundred drinkers had become abstainers.
Such rates of improvement are not significantly better than those shown in studies of the spontaneous or natural improvement of chronic drinkers not in treatment.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So much for all of those expensive treatment programs that are based on Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
You can read a longer, more detailed, description of the study
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">here</a>.
<p>
Have a good day.

Thanks for your help.  I don't get a lot of free time to give to this but I may be

To keep you going, thought you might find this interesting.  It's from a treatment
centre (UK spelling!) in Scotland.

<p>
Read the review (5th on the list).  A barely concealed admission that this centre's
main purpose is to get people to undergo a religious conversion in AA (on the last
page).  It is filled with lies and misleading half-truths (the Big Book was written
by the first hundred members) and actually quotes out of context the same doctor you
told me about who took part in that study in the '70s which revealed AA's
ineffectiveness.

<p>

Hello from Montana. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this
website. I really feel as if I was &quot;born again&quot; in the deprogramming
sense, that is.
<p>
I've been sober since Feb. 2005 (am 39 now) but I started to question
why the hell I was subjecting myself to the ongoing guilt induction
of attending meetings 4 times a week when I felt worse afterwards..I
really like my sponsor and several other &quot;members&quot; but holy buckets,
it wasn't my imagination. it really is a strange group of
hypocritical nonsense for the most part &#8212; where only time of sobriety
is equated with one's standing or worth. What dreck, what propagandist
($ is that a word?! lol) horseshit! I always suspected Bill W. was a
womanizing wackjob but never heard much about Dr. Bob than his
saintly qualities and how he completed the ballyhooed and insidious
steps in a week etc. I'm glad the &quot;program&quot; has helped millions of
people and I'm glad it was there for me after my DUI and court-ordered
sentence but surely it is time for a new point of view! Thank
you for shedding some light, some truth and making me chuckle along
the way.

<p>

You've done enough &quot;service&quot; work for this lifetime and many more in
my book. You expressed so well what I secretly thought and I am
grateful to be out from under that soul-crushing regime... I told my
sponsor I am not going to meetings except one attended by favorite
(not as hardcore culties) people. She understands I think...

<p>

I dated 2 guys in AA and they are both narcissistic predators (on
newcomer women. what a shocker, eh!).

<p>

Again, thank you, Orange. You saved my sanity, friend.

From:  	&quot;Russell L.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN?<br>

<p>

Do you have an answer........I doubt it. Have you earnestly considered the
question......very unlikely.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Russell,
<p>
Actually, I've considered that question a lot &#8212; especially since it is one of the favorite attacks
that true believers in Alcoholics Anonymous parrot.
(Although they never explain how telling the truth about A.A. will kill an alcoholic.)
<p>
I have also considered the question of how many alcoholics get killed by A.A. misinformation and bad counseling &#8212;
like telling them not to take their medications &#8212;
and I find that A.A. kills more alcoholics than it saves.
</font>
<p>

One way to gauge the success of your crusade is to be able to answer the question
with a zero.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I don't have a &quot;crusade&quot;. I just want to get the truth out there.
<p>
And so far, I guess that the answer really is zero. I have not yet heard of one alcoholic
who instantly relapsed and drank himself to death because he heard the truth about A.A., Bill Wilson,
the Oxford Group religious cult, or the actual A.A. failure rate.
<p>
The real reasons why people drink alcohol to excess are other things than that stuff.
</font>
<p>



Google and other searches throw up your website when searches for AA etc are made.
Whatever you may think of AA, even you will have to accept that desperate people &#8212;
even if only for short periods &#8212; find help there and survive that terrible time of
despair. Some, accepting your view of AA, no doubt go on from that immediate
survival to be misled and mistreated and may even lose their life because of AA.
Others, just as certainly, are put off by you. Of these some will not survive, dying
before they find buried in your website the helpful links to other life-saving
sites.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are assuming facts not in evidence. You are assuming that A.A. helps alcoholics
and saves their lives. You should read about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">the study done by
Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, who is a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, as well
as a member of the
Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous [World] Services, Inc.,
and one of the most enthusiastic promoters of A.A. that there is.
When he tried to prove that A.A. works, he found that A.A. actually increased the death rate of alcoholics,
and that A.A. didn't help the alcoholics to quit drinking at all.

<p>
Likewise,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">
Dr. Brandsma</a> found that A.A. attendance actually increased the rate of binge drinking.
<p>
So your claim that steering alcoholics away from A.A. will harm them or cause them to die
doesn't hold any water.
<p>
And once again, I have to ask the question that A.A. members refuse to answer:

<p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>
If we send 1000 randomly-selected alcoholics to A.A., how many
of them will get a year of sobriety? How many of those 1-year medallions
will you need to keep on hand to give out a year later?
</b>
<br>
(Hint: See the answers
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.)
<p>
<li>
<b>
And how does that success rate compare to the success rate that comes from
sending 1000 alcoholics to the
local Tiddly-Winks Society, or the Ladies' Home Garden Club, or the Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Parlor?
</b>
<br>
(Hint: the success rate there will be
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">about 50 per thousand</a>.)
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Please answer those questions. They are very important questions, and reveal the
whole truth about &quot;Twelve-Step Recovery&quot;.

</font>
<p>


You should address this, even if it is only to avoid being sued. It might also save
lives. I don't know which will influence you more.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, it is the treatment centers who are selling 12-Step cult religion as a quack cure
for alcoholism who are in great danger of getting sued.
</font>
<p>



Having read your introduction, I only skimmed the rest of this pseudo
intellectualism. I was put off by your rage. I was also put off
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">your PS concerning
the now-disgraced councillor</a>.  If there is one thing worthy of note about that
incident it is not some self-aggrandizing gloat over the downfall of a sick man but
pity and sympathy for the wretched victims of his act. And for him too. That seems
to have escaped you. For that and other reasons it seems likely that I will not get
a reply to this email from you.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I did not &quot;gloat&quot; over his downfall. I was very surprised, even mildly shocked,
to discover what was really going on. It left me with a feeling of, &quot;Hmmm. Maybe that
explains why he gave me the creeps.&quot;
<p>
And his downfall didn't leave me feeling good about it. It left me feeling
appalled that sick people &#8212; fellow alcoholics &#8212; who are really seeking
help get such B.S. shoved at them, and it is financed with our tax dollars.
</font>

<p>
So be it. I hope your experience of AA has only soured your thinking about AA and
that you are otherwise a whole and healthy person. I would be surprised, but there
is always hope.
<p>
Good wishes for your recovery.<br>

Hey, I just wanted to tell you I read (most of) your argument against AA &#8212;
your research is good, and I can't argue against your opinion. Funny enough,
I stumbled upon it while looking for some online insight into my first step
work! : )
<p>
You know, I can't really cipher AA in a purely logical way right now, what
with my new sobriety &#8212; I've only been clean for 17 days &#8212; but I am happy at
this moment. Drunk, or drinking, I am out of control and hate myself. So
far, AA has given me some dignity back, some friends and most importantly,
hope. I understand AA is not for everyone &#8212; I just feel so lucky to have
found a fit for myself. What I've noticed is that the most successful
(sober) people in AA are those who do the work and continue to maintain it
with service inside AA, such as sponsoring new people and chairing
meetings.

<p>

You mention that AA is a cult, and I disagree. My sponsor has suggested that
I go to a meeting a day, and I do that. I also give a dollar, or whatever I
have, each meeting, to support the program. I don't think these things are
unreasonable. My work is my choice &#8212; I am not required to go to 30 meetings
or make coffee (though I would) or get a divorce or any of the other crap
that goes on with real cults. If I fail, I will be welcome back if and when
I am capable of sobriety again. Again, I'm new, so I should give it some
time.

<p>

I assume you've had problems with drinking too, otherwise you wouldn't be
writing this. Or you know addiction. Whatever helped you find sobriety, good
job and good luck. : )

Hello Chloe,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your 17 days. (Hopefully it's now 27 days.)
<p>
The first few weeks and months are the hardest, and then it gets easier, so congratulations on
your first 3 weeks. The longest journey begins with a single step.

<p>
I'm glad to hear that you haven't encountered objectionable cultish behavior in A.A. yet, in 17 days.
And I hope it doesn't happen to you in the future. Just keep your eyes open, and if somebody tells
you to quit taking your doctor-prescribed medications and just trust the 12 Steps to heal you, run
for the door.
<p>
Also beware of raps about how
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">you should have sex with some old sponsor</a>
so that you can learn how to have sober sex...

<p>
Also beware of
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">the constant put-downs</a>
that are damaging to your dignity and self-esteem &#8212; the dignity and self-esteem that
you are just starting to get now.  By the way, YOU gave yourself that new dignity and 
self-respect, not A.A., because YOU quit drinking. A.A. didn't do it for you.
(And notice that A.A. will not give you any respect or dignity if you take a drink.)

<p>
Because you are so new in your sobriety, the one thing I'd really like you to read is the web page on
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.
That essay is not a criticism of A.A.; I don't think it even mentions A.A. more than one indirect reference.
It's about how to not get fooled by the mumbling and grumbling of the lower brain as it demands its
feel-goods. In other words, it's about how to not relapse.

<p>
Good luck, and have a good day.

A.A. is not &quot;one extraordinary thing&quot;, not unless you also consider Scientology and the Moonies

<p>
And the A.A. program does not and has not &quot;saved millions of lives&quot;. We've been over that endlessly.

The reason I bother to tell the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous is because it has hurt a lot of people,

<p>

Dear Orange,
<p>

Thanks for a wonderful website on the dangers of AA.
<p>
After an injury last year and the resulting problems with pain meds (and
too much alcohol) I ended up in the hospital with a serious heart
malfunction. After it was taken care of I was approached by a local
treatment center that, supposedly, wanted to help me make sure it never
happened again. Well, the red flags went up when they mentioned the cost,
the length of time it would take and the requirement that I attend AA
regularly (they were all AA members). When I said no thanks, they started
hurling insults and accusations and I walked out.
<p>
Today, I'm healthy and happy thanks to a lot of research, Rational
Recovery and sites like yours.
<p>

Please keep up the good work. You're saving lives if people will only take
the time to read and learn.

Questions like:

<li> What is the &quot;treatment&quot;, really?
Please be very specific about what constitutes &quot;treatment&quot;.
<p>
<li>
What disease or condition or illness are you treating?
Please be very specific.
Is that disease listed in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>?

<p>
<li> How well does the treatment work? Specifically, what percentage of those people who start the program 
&#8212; pay the money and start the treatment &#8212; are still clean and sober a year later?

<p>

What guarantees do you give? Do you offer a money-back guarantee for when the treatment doesn't work?

Subject:  	hi<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

Thank you for the web site Orange-Papers, very informative and what a
lot of research you have done here!

<p>

I was able to begin sobriety in 1974 in Canada through AA.

<p>

I don't go to meetings anymore. Since the early 80's I found that
going to meetings did not help my sobriety, or should I say, my state
of mind ... peace of mind.

<p>

If anything, AA meetings began to contribute to restlessness,
compulsive eating and insomnia. I've managed to keep sober without
meetings and gave up the smokes about the time I stopped attending AA
regularly. Its great to breathe fresh air.

<p>

A few times I have attempted to 're-join' by attending a meeting or
two, but I sense that AA is getting worse and worse.

<p>

Your site gave me some clues as to why I  kept away from AA.
The sharp comments and bossiness from the AA members toward newcomers
would have made me walk out even though I  was desperate to gain
sobriety if it had been like that when I began.
<p>
The groups I went to originally in Alberta seemed to be filled with
really helpful and very nice people; and in those days the treatment
centres were just beginning to invite AA members to take part in
recovery programs that they offered and we didn't actually feel
comfortable affiliating with them and the counselors who treated
addictions.

<p>

I remember being in the grocery store and having an 'old timer' AA
woman literally hounding me all around the store about my bad attitude
and how I should attend more meetings, that was about the time I was
cutting back getting to AA.

<p>

I rarely have heard of anyone going to AA these days who hasn't
attended a treatment centre having a counselor, and there are those
who have had their families and friends attack them through an
'intervention' assisted by a hired 'professional' AA.  I doubt I
would  be sober if I had to attend aa meetings as they are now and go
through hearing all of the psycho babble that they preach.

<p>

Your site offers hope to alcoholics who can't stand AA and that's
good!!!

<p>

Have a wonderful day.

<p>

C. J.

This gosling is fighting with a hair. For some odd reason, they eat all of the hairs that they
find. I was forever finding them with hairs hanging out of their mouths.
When a gosling gets a hair halfways into itself like this, you have to either pull it back out,
or, if you cannot do that because it seems to be snagged inside, clip it
off short and let the little turkey pass it.
<p>
Later, that hair-eating would turn into a real problem.

<p>

I read the article described in the subject above. First of, I'm neither acting on
behalf of AA nor agree or disagree with AA methods.
I do however found that this article is grossly misleading. Most of the quotations
from the big book and AA comes of age are taken out of context. I found that your
views are totally bias.

<p>

I do have three questions for you though:
<ul>
<li>
1,    What is your solution for alcoholism (this assumes that you have any)
<li>
2,    Are all religious organizations (such as Christianity, Islamic, Buddhism etc.)
cults as well?
<li>
3,    What are the differences between spiritual and religious organizations
</ul>


<p>

I must say though that you did a lot of work on this article. Unfortunately, it is a
lot of work with a biased (if not hatred) look at AA

<p>

Sincerely

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ekun,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Well, starting at the top, I do not quote out of context. That is a common attack, but it just isn't true.
I am very careful not to distort or change the meaning of things that I quote.
We have discussed that accusation before, several times.
<a href="orange-letters12.html#context">Look here</a>.
<p>
Quoting out of context is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context">a debating or propaganda trick</a>
where you extract a few words in a manner that changes the meaning of what you are quoting.
(<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context">Look here</a>.)
I challenge you to show me even one example where I incorrectly quoted
something out of context and changed the meaning of the words.
<p>
Just quoting things isn't &quot;quoting out of context&quot;.


<p>
Now, your other questions:
</font>
<p>

<ul>
<li>
1,    What is your solution for alcoholism (this assumes that you have any)
<p>
<font color="blue">
Stop drinking so much alcohol. If you can't cut down and keep it down to a dull roar, then quit drinking
alcohol entirely (like I had to do).

<p>
If you want some company or advice, there are many groups or organizations or web sites
that you can join or attend or visit for a while:

<p>
You could also try reading some good books on the subject. Check out
<a href="orange-top10.html">the Top 10 reading list</a>.
<p>
And especially read the web page on
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.

</font>
<p>
<li>
2,    Are all religious organizations (such as Christianity, Islamic, Buddhism etc.)
cults as well?
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, not at all. Read
<a href="orange-cult.html">
the Cult Test</a>
for a list of characteristics of a cult.
Then you can compare those mainstream religions with cults like the Moonies, Scientology, Heaven's Gate,
The People's Temple, The Branch Davidians, and Alcoholics Anonymous.

</font>
<p>
<li>
3,    What are the differences between spiritual and religious organizations
<p>
<font color="blue">
None. It's just a word game. When this question was asked in a Federal Circuit Court, the
judge answered:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Alcoholics Anonymous materials and the testimony of the witness established
beyond a doubt that religious activities, as defined in constitutional law,
were a part of the treatment program.
The distinction between religion and spirituality is meaningless, and
serves merely to confuse the issue.

Orange,

<p>

What all is in your web-site (which is too numerous to plod through-
accurate as it is!), that covers the OVERWHELMING &quot;conflict of
interest&quot; between &quot;12-Steppers&quot; that are also certified (or licensed)
AOD counselors?
<p>
I am interested in EXPOSING those certified AOD
counselors that are also &quot;12-Steppers&quot; (as 90% of them are!), that
they CANNOT be loyal to both the &quot;best interests of a
client&quot; (requiring INDIVIDUAL consideration!), while at the same time
have the LOYALTY to &quot;12 Step Principals&quot; (i.e. 12 Steps and 12
Traditions), where an individual is COMPLETELY NEGATED!

<p>

I know Jack Trimpey touches on this, but I am wondering if you do as
well.

<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again. I don't have any one item or paper on the conflict of
interest between true-believer Steppers and AOD counselors who are also the true believers.
It's kind of just implied and spread out throughout the whole web site.
<p>
There is, of course, an obvious conflict of interest there. Is the counselor really doing what
is in the best interests of his clients, or is he simply pushing his own crazy cult
religion on other people?
<p>
And the problem isn't just A.A. and N.A., either.
I notice that there is the same conflict of interest with Scientologists
who are selling &quot;Narconon&quot; as
a cure for alcohol and drug problems.
<p>
Good luck.

RE: Why you SHOULD VETO AB 239 
<p>


	AB 239 will be presented to you soon (presumeably after the state budget ever gets passed, and signed!), and IT NEEDS TO BE IMMEDITELY VETOED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: 
<p>

	1.) The counselor certification &quot;process&quot; has not even been around long enough (since 2005) to work out all the &quot;glitches&quot;, questions, and un-resolved issues, as evidenced in the minutes/notes from the March 5, 2008 Counselor Certification Advisory Committee (and these same sources want LICENSURE?). 
<p>

	2.) There is an OVERWHELMING CONFLICT OF INTEREST in those AOD counselors who are &quot;certified&quot; yet, still  &quot;in recovery&quot;. How can it be justified in ANY instance that an AOD counselor should get A STATE LICENSE in this field, when these same people are more then likely prone to RELAPSE with the addictions that they allegedly are supposed to &quot;counsel&quot; (and diagnose!) people with? A review of the state of Arizona's AOD Counselor licensure revocations would be a good place to look to see what the state of CA would be setting itself up for! Licensing people &quot;in recovery&quot; to &quot;counsel&quot; and &quot;diagnose&quot; people &quot;in recovery&quot; is BEYOND WRONG! 
<p>

	3.) CAADAC, the counselor certification organization that is behind sponsoring this bill, believes that getting AOD counselors &quot;licensed&quot; will somehow &quot;raise the pay&quot; of counselors in the field, yet CA addiction treatment facilities that employ most counselors, utilize those who are FORMER CLIENTS OF THE FACILITIES of those very same facilities! Additionally, those same facilities are NOT going to want to pay higher wages to &quot;licensed&quot; counselors, when they barely employ licensed clinicians and professionals (e.g. Psychologists, psychiatrists, LVN's), etc. These facilities are IN the addiction treatment field FOR THE MONEY! 
They do not want to spend MORE on &quot;licensed&quot; staff unless they HAVE TO! 
<p>

	4.) THIS STATE CANNOT AFFORD TO &quot;ADVANCE&quot; EVEN $1 to get  this bill &quot;implemented&quot;. The idea that any &quot;licensing implementation cost&quot; will be paid by the people that are eligible for, and QUALIFIED TO BE &quot;LICENSED&quot; implies that there are enough people that meet that criteria! THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE! A review of the 9 counselor certifying organizations will show you that most of them have more people only &quot;registered&quot; with them, and NOT EVEN AT A CERTIFIED LEVEL, to say nothing of the EDUCATION, and EXPERIENCE NEEDED in the AOD field to qualify for the &quot;licensure&quot; this bill attempts to enact. 
<p>

	For the above reasons, VOTE NO ON AB 239! DO NOT &quot;ENABLE&quot; the addiction &quot;treatment&quot; industry to add even MORE DYSFUNCTION TO AN ALREADY DYSFUNCTIONAL FIELD, as evidenced in the above examples, and more too many to list (that you do not have time to read anyway!).

OG,

<p>

I found your website by searching google for &quot;AA success rate&quot;.  I
knew from studying (not as much as you by any means) that the success
rate is very low.  I have been in the program since 12-13-04.  I
grabbed 2 years right away and then had problems with relapse. I
really fuck myself up with alcohol, but pot is my drug of choice. I am
a true alcoholic.  not a problem drinker.  I love many aspects of AA.
<p>
But I seek truth, so i always study lots of stuff.  I wanted to
commend you on your website.  Although I disagree with alot of what
you say, not because of blind dogma,but  because , for me The Big Book
describes ME.  I am the ego manic with an inferiority complex. I am a
liar, I do steal, i do cheat. (or did for all those flaws) I am
chronically selfish.  This is not something i needed to be convinced
of.
<p>
Well actually i was so caught up in self that, I would have told
you &quot; I have a good Heart&quot; and i do.  But my heart is inside me and
people dont get to see it. So i need more then a &quot;good heart&quot;.
<p>
I
belong to no organized religion, No one has ever tried to convert me.
I have met some of the finest people I have ever met in 32 years. I
don't believe AA is the only way, but for me it fits.  I needed a
moral overhauling, I'm not all better or anything but much much
better.  It is cool to be able to hang out with people that are like
me and Most, not all, are.  I would be quite lonely.

<p>

Anyways I wrote you because The history aspect you have put together
is &quot;super&quot; important.  Bill was A very sick dude.  You opened my eyes
to some truths about the big book i was not aware of.  I don't like
your opinion of AA but I don't have to.

<p>

Thanks for putting this together. I will  send my friends that have
open minds here for the historical aspects.

Hi Michael,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
The one thing that really stands out in your letter is how much you beat up on yourself.
You don't have to do that any more. In fact, you will be much better off if you don't.

<p>
What you used to be isn't what you are now.
<p>
I can suddenly hear Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young singing,<br>
<b><i>&quot;Do not let the past, Remind us of what we are not now...&quot;</i></b>

<p>
Yes.

<p>
Several years ago now, I told one woman friend that I was an alcoholic.<br>
She said, &quot;What?!  I've <i>never</i> seen you drunk.&quot;<br>
I answered, &quot;That's true, because I've never taken a drink in all of the time
that you've known me.&quot;<br>
She said, &quot;Hmmm... That isn't how the alcoholics that I know of work.&quot;
<p>
She had a point. I thought, maybe I should call myself someone who <i>used to</i> drink
too much, or someone who shouldn't drink alcohol now because I tend to go non-linear
on the stuff, and one drink always seems to turn into two six-packs every night for years...
<p>
Just using the generic word, &quot;alcoholic&quot;,
<a href="orange-letters86.html#definitions">with its various different definitions</a>,
is getting to be too inaccurate. That's really not who I am any more.

<p>
The idea of saying &quot;I am an alcoholic&quot; in meetings once or twice a
week for the rest of my life seems self-defeating and harmful.
And constantly proclaiming that you are selfish and a liar and a thief is even worse.
That can really mess up your head.

<p>
Steven Gaskin once said that
the two most magical words in the English language are &quot;I am&quot;. And
he said that you should be <i>*very*</i> careful about what you put after those two
words. You are defining yourself, and making yourself into something.
<p>
(And it really works. It works on your head, and you really can turn yourself into something else.)

<p>
I think it's time for you to start saying that you are essentially a good person who had a bad time of it
for a while, but that's over. That's way in the past.
And you are doing better now.
<p>
So have a good day.

The goslings discovered that there was a hole with loose dirt in the middle of the field. They squeeled with
delight when they found it, and dug right into the dirt. I'm pretty sure that they are digging for crop
stones. They want to find a bunch of just the right little stones to swallow and fill their crops, which
they use to grind their food (because they don't have any teeth, and can't chew their food).

Subject:  	Freedom From The Steps<br>

<p>
Well, I have not been to a meeting for over one year now, and guess what?  I
am still clean and sober!  I am still grateful for finding your website two
years ago.  I still have friends that go to meetings but most are too far
gone to have a discussion with about AA/NA.  One even told me that he had
&quot;resigned from the debating club&quot;.  I was thinking that if alcohol had never
been invented/discovered that there would not be one individual that could
be identified, diagnosed or otherwise characterized as being an alcoholic!!
The cause of the so called disease of alcoholism is alcohol.

<p>
Anyway, glad to see you are responding to letters again.  Oh by the way the
goslings are cute, however here in East Tennessee we do not view them as
such due to the influx in their migratory habits.  They have become a
nuisance.

<p>
Thanks Again &#8212; Nip

Hi again, Nip,
<p>
It's good to hear from you. Congratulations on your successes &#8212; both the escape from addictions, and
the escape from Steps.
<p>
I understand how the Canada Geese are considered pests or nuisances in some places. As the human
population explodes, they build on everything and occupy all of the land, and don't leave a lot
of room for the wildlife. So the wildlife just moves right into where the people are.
Collisions and conflicts are inevitable.

<p>
Here in Oregon, we have big rivers where the geese are at home, and they aren't quite such a problem.
Still, some people really get annoyed by the geese.
<p>
My favorite laugh is seeing some guy park his horrendously-expensive
yacht at the marina, a huge glistening white thing that cost millions of dollars
and is three stories tall. Then some big honking goose flies all the way up to the very top, up on the
roof of the topmost deck and bridge, and then just stands up there and shits on the boat.
And the owner just glares at that goose. And the goose just honks back at him.
<p>
I'm not sure if the goose is expressing his opinion of the yacht, or if he just doesn't give a damn.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	death/injury due to AA's words<br>

<p>

Dear Orange,

<p>

In your response to a recent email, you said that there's not way to know
how many deaths can be attributed to AA [in the context of how anti-AA words
could kill someone].  Of course, a scientific study would be the best way to
determine this, but one would need willing participants, double-blind and no
&quot;reinterpreting&quot; data later to make AA look better.  In the absence of such
conditions, anecdotes can indicate areas where research is necessary.

<p>

I have a couple of anecdotes on the subject:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
A friend's child, who'd refrained from using speed for 12 years, and had a
heart condition, was told by their NA group that &quot;no doctor&quot; would take them
on as a patient because of their &quot;drug history&quot;.  Note the person was
wanting permission to have treatment for this known heart condition.
Untreated heart disease killed this person at the age of 42.

<p>

<li>
Another person I know had had intestinal surgery.  This person called me and
said &quot;my addictive brain is playing tricks on me&quot;, making pain meds not work
to convince this person to take more drugs.  In the morning, I took the
person to see the surgeon, who discovered that *the colon had prolapsed*.
This person, fortunately, survived thanks to timely medical intervention,
and has not taken up recreational drug use in the wake of this episode.

<p>

<li>
I also think AA/NA has so poisoned the medical community's attitude about
pain treatment that far too much pain is undertreated, even in people with
no history of abusing any drugs.  For example, Discovery Channel has done
several programs about kids from foreign countries being taken to the US for
serious surgeries &#8212; for example, a girl from Ireland having her face
reconstructed.  The kids are often shown in pain while in the hospital, and
comments sometimes made about how much pain there is.  Compare that to a
recent surgery in India, to remove 4 extra limbs from a little girl, after
which the doctor told her parents not to worry about their daughter being in
pain when she woke up, as they'd given her plenty of medicine to take care
of that.  When I think of how many kids with chronic &amp; painful conditions
who are currently being taught to &quot;live with the pain&quot;, I want to cry.
</ul>

<p>

<p>

P.S. If you post this email, please don't use my name &#8212; I don't want any
friends/relatives/acquaintances of the above people knowing who sent this.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, X.,
<p>
It's good to hear from you again.
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and the anecdotes. They do illustrate problems with A.A. &#8212; the
same old problems that just never seem to go away.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	how many people have LIVED because of your website?????<br>

<p>

Greetings Agent Orange!

<p>

I believe I wrote you back in about February thanking you for your website.  I found
the site in the middle of a long, sleepless night... I was sitting up because I
could not silence the confusion in my head; AA (and the coke snorting looser that
dragged me to it) had twisted all of my thoughts into such a mess, I could barely
think past the little voice crying &quot;this doesn't make sense!&quot;

<p>

I find it hilarious that so many people accuse you of murdering the innocent drunks
who google your site. Last time I checked this was still a free country... Anyway, I
would like to thank you again for giving me my life back.  Or at least the means to
take it back myself.  I stayed up all night that night reading your cult test &#8212; it
is absolutely accurate. I quit AA, stopped accepting constant sexism and criticism,
and ditched the man that convinced me &quot;I had a problem.&quot;  I don't touch drugs, and I
honestly don't believe that one occasional glass of wine with dinner will kill me.
I landed my dream job, and am overwhelmingly happy with my life.... I am out living
my life instead of sitting in meetings with a bunch of sick, unhappy people.

<p>

I'm AA-free for 8 months and have never been happier!

<p>

Thank you again :)

<p>

Gypsy

PS... my name should not appear with this email, if it does, please delete it? I
would prefer to just be &quot;gypsy.&quot;

Hi Gypsy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments, and I'm glad to hear about your successful escape
