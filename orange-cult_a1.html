Alcoholics Anonymous undoubtedly declares that it is <i>the only way.</i>
A.A. believes that
there is no other possible way to recover from alcoholism,
period, so there is no point in even looking
for another way, or studying alternative treatment methods.
Alcoholism can only be cured, or not cured, but &quot;treated&quot;, by
&quot;one drunk talking to another&quot;. Only an A.A. member can
help an alcoholic.
To send an alcoholic to any other
treatment program is to subject him to a death sentence, they
say.
<p>
The A.A. literature says:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual
experience will conquer. &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
At first some of us tried to avoid the
issue, hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after
a while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual
basis of life &#8212; or else.</font><br>

Here, Bill talks about prospects who are invited to join A.A.:<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some of them may sink and perhaps never get up, but if our
experience is a criterion, more than half of those
approached will become fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.</font><br>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson, page 163.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>
Note that there is no third choice: either sink or join Alcoholics Anonymous.
(That is an example of the <a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="_blank">Either-Or Propaganda Technique</a>.)
Recovery without A.A. is not considered possible.
According to Bill, nothing else, like do-it-yourself, works.
No other program works. There are no other choices than join A.A. or die.
<p>
Also note that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the recruiting rate that Bill claimed &#8212;
&quot;more than half&quot; &#8212; is totally untrue</a>. Bill was just lying about the A.A.
recruiting rate again, trying to make A.A. look like a big success.

<p>
Likewise:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The final decision came when my daughter, following a drunk
which ruined my wife's birthday, said,
&quot;It's Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; or else!&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 378.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


<a name="death_warrant"> </a>
Bill Wilson even declared that failure to
follow his directions would result in death:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested
<font color="#9F0000">[my required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant. His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to <font color="#9F0000">[my]</font>
spiritual principles <font color="#9F0000">[superstitions]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson's delusions of grandeur are showing here:
if you don't do his Twelve Steps,
then you are guilty of <i><b>&quot;personal disobedience to
spiritual principles.&quot;</b></i>
Mr. Wilson seems to believe that only he knows and has written down
<i><b>The Real Spiritual Rules of God</b></i>, and they are embodied
in The Twelve Steps.
No other church is valid &#8212; their spiritual principles are worthless,
and practicing them will not save you from a fate worse than death.
Either do it Bill's way,
or you are disobeying <i><b>The Real Spiritual Principles of God</b></i>,
and you will pay for your disobedience with your life.
<p>
Bill Wilson declared (in so many words):
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I am the Recovery Program, thy Recovery Program. Thou shalt
have no other Recovery Programs before Me, for thy Recovery
Program is a jealous Recovery Program, and It wants your whole life.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>


<p>
In addition, A.A. boosters also constantly repeat the
<i>Big Lie</i> that A.A. works, and A.A. with its Twelve Steps is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody">the way that
everybody recovers</a> &#8212; It's <i>the only way</i> that works:

<a name="Mooney"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One way or another Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar Twelve-Step
program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries
from alcohol or drug abuse. In fact, it is widely believed
that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can
put a recovering addict on the road to relapse. For some people,
regular participation in such a mutual self-help group is all
that is needed to become and remain sober.<br></font>

<font color="#4f007f">

That is a complete falsehood. The good, unbiased,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">scientific research</a>
shows just the opposite. So do the surveys of successful quitters.
Most people who recover do it
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">without any 12-step &quot;treatment&quot;</a>.

<font color="blue">
It is widely believed by whom, besides a few true-believer A.A. and N.A. members?
When did mainstream medicine decide that confessing your sins and admitting powerlessness
over drugs and alcohol was necessary for recovery

</font>

<li> Notice the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences">fear-mongering</a>: you
will be &quot;on the road to relapse&quot;
unless you do Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps.
<li> Notice the Pollyanna attitude: just going
to the wonderful A.A. meetings is all that is needed to fix some
alcoholics.
</ul>
<p>
The truth is just the opposite of what they are claiming:
The vast majority of the people who do successfully recover from
drug or alcohol addictions
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">like 75% or 80% of them</a>),
including the
former President of the United States, George W. Bush,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment">actually do it without any
Twelve-Step program</a>, or even any recovery group of any kind.
Contrary to everything you have ever been told by 12-step enthusiasts,
<font color="blue">
going it alone is actually the &quot;<i>time-tested, proven</i>, method
that really works.&quot;</font>
The 12-step method works for very few people.

There is a high rate of recovery among alcoholics and addicts,
treated and untreated. According to one estimate, heroin addicts
break the habit in an average of 11 years.
Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was
interviewed, 57% said they simply decided that alcohol was bad
for them. Twenty-nine percent said health problems,
frightening experiences,
accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.
Others used such phrases as &quot;Things were building up&quot;
or &quot;I was sick and tired of it.&quot; Support from a husband
or wife was important in sustaining the resolution.

Friday, January 20th 2006
<p>
WOW*  Carrying The Message.  I went to my regular Wednesday night
meeting yesterday.  Since I got to this city a year ago, the meeting
has always been run by newcomers, Salvation Army dudes and people
trying to recover in rehabs and &quot;other programs.&quot;  Before the meeting
started, I had been sharing my dismay at the fact that we never get to
hear any AA in that meeting.  When it came time for the leader to lead
the meeting and open up with a topic...he called on me instead.  YIKES!
I was already fired up, having been thinking about &quot;things&quot; all week
long.  I opened up with both barrels!  I got really passionate about
what I was saying and my voice got louder and faster, BUT...even though
there was anger in my voice...it was ALL out of our Big Book.  I shared
that I was tired of hearing everything BUT AA in this meeting, that I
didn't care WHAT OTHER PROGRAM you got here, WHAT your Higher Power's
first name is, or HOW MANY TRUE &amp; FALSE or MULTIPLE CHOICE questions
your &quot;sponsor&quot; made you FILL OUT on your 4th Step!  I also shared that
IF YOU DO WHAT WE DO...YOU JUST MIGHT GET A LITTLE SOBER TIME AROUND
HERE!  A few of the guys from the Salvation Army were laughing at me
and I suggested to them that they could laugh all they wanted.  They
could also go out and try to stay sober using just the Salvation Army
and Jesus Christ and that we would save them a seat in AA IF they make
it back!!  After all, WHY do they think those &quot;other programs&quot; send
them to AA anyway?  THIS is the easier softer way people!  If it could
have been any easier to do...Bill W. would have incorporated it into
our book!  Gratefully...a few people with quite a bit of sober time,
shared after I did.  They said the same things I did, only perhaps a
little more gently...lol.<br>

Notice the criticism of faith in Jesus Christ there. This A.A. true believer says that a 
program based on Jesus won't work, and you will be lucky to survive it.
 But he will save
a seat for you at the A.A. meeting, if you live long enough to make it back to a meeting.
Only the A.A. program works.
So much for the hypocritical A.A. claims that &quot;There is no friction among us over such matters&quot;.
(<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#no_friction" target="_blank"><font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">



If you take A.A. and throw away the Twelve Steps, the Buchmanite
religion, and the rest of
Bill Wilson's fanatical religious preachings, then you just might
end up with what A.A. claims to be: a wonderful self-help fellowship
of alcoholics just trying to help each other live.
<p>
In truth, some of this exists at all times.  There are always some
members who are at the meetings to
share their experience, their strength, and their hopes, hoping to
help both others and themselves.  Some of those people may not even
believe in or practice the Twelve Steps; they just like the fellowship
part of A.A..
<p>
Alas, there are also always some preachers who are there in the rooms
to deliver
their standard sermons about how A.A. and the Twelve Steps are the
<b><i>only way</i></b> to achieve and maintain sobriety.  Such people
are sharing only their uninformed fanatical opinions &#8212; they would
have had to have tried every quit-drinking program in the world,
and to have failed with all of the others, and to have succeeded
only with A.A. and the Twelve Steps &#8212; not just with A.A., but
<b><i>only</i></b> with both A.A. <b><i>AND</i></b> the Twelve Steps,
for their statements to be true experience.
<p>
I never heard of anyone
who really performed that experiment.  I've heard of a few people
who tried two other programs, like the Veterans' Administration
program, and a Christian Brotherhood program, or the Salvation Army and the Catholic DePaul program,
in addition to A.A.,
but that sure isn't <b><i>all</i></b> of the programs in the world.
<p>
In addition, the order in which someone conducts the experiments matters.
If someone tries the A.A. program and succeeds in quitting drinking, then he should still continue
the experiment: Return to drinking, and then find out whether the
V.A. program or the Christian
program or the Salvation Army or the DePaul program
also works for quitting drinking at that point.
Most people stop testing programs
just as soon as something works &#8212; just as soon as they quit drinking.
They just stick with whichever program they happen to be in when they quit,
and insist that <i>It</i> is the good one.
That is bad science. A man cannot then say that A.A. is the only thing
that works for causing or maintaining sobriety, if he fails to test and re-test
all of the other programs.
<p>
So someone who says that A.A. is <i>the only thing</i> that works is just
blowing hot air, voicing his uninformed opinion. The A.A. traditions
say that we are supposed to share our &quot;strengths, hopes, and
experience&quot;, not our uninformed opinions on subjects about which
we actually know very little.

<p>
Ordinarily, I would say that the stupid fools at the meetings don't
matter. They can be ignored. But in this case, I can't escape the
feeling that the fanatics are driving many people away, people who
came seeking help, and that without that help, some of those people
will get into worse trouble, and maybe even die.
<p>
Not good.

unquestionably feel that they are special, and different from

Some of that feeling may
be justified, because they are alcoholics, and they are the

they may lose whole families in disasters; but still, the alcoholics supposedly suffer more.
In fact, the alcoholics' suffering was supposedly
so much greater than that of normal people that the normal people
cannot even understand the terrible special suffering of
an alcoholic. That is an elitist attitude.

<p>
Likewise, the popular A.A. slogan
<font color="#4f007f"><i><b>
&quot;Religion is for people who are afraid of going to Hell, Spirituality is
for people who've been there&quot;</b></i></font>
is how they attempt to
distinguish their &quot;spiritual&quot; program from a religion,
which implies that A.A. people are superior to ordinary religious
people,
because A.A. people aren't afraid of going to Hell anymore, not like
&quot;normies&quot; (normal people) are.
That is just an arrogant ego game of spiritual one-up-manship.
<p>
A.A. uses membership in A.A. itself as a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#granfalloon">granfalloon</a>. Those
who do The Twelve Steps are &quot;one of us&quot;, members of the right
religion, <i>&quot;The Friends of Bill&quot;</i>;
while those who don't do The Steps
are <b><i>the other people</i></b>, &quot;normies&quot; or
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunks</a>&quot;
who aren't our friends and who cannot be trusted.
Non-AA-member ex-drinkers are allegedly all insane and &quot;thinking alcoholically&quot;,
and they are not qualified to judge Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
<a name="no_self_sufficiency"> </a>
In the <i>Big Book</i>, an A.A. member says of a non-member:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;You poor guy. I feel so sorry for you. You're not an alcoholic.
You can never know the pure joy of recovering within the Fellowship of
Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 334.</font>

<p>
That is, of course, just incredibly outrageous self-congratulatory bull.
No one is lucky to be an alcoholic and be forced to join A.A. or any
other cult.
<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> contains more of the same <i>We Are Special</i> hype:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
In his own story of alcoholism and joining A.A., Paul Molloy gave us this
bombastic, grandiose garbage, supposedly from a non-alcoholic who is envious
of those lucky alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;... there are times, oh so many times, when I wish I had been an alcoholic. The reason is
that I consider the AA people to be the most charming in the world. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I asked myself why I consider so charming these alcoholic caterpillars who have
found their butterfly wings in AA. I can name a few reasons. The AA people are what they
are, and they were what they were, because they are sensitive, imaginative,
possessed of a sense of humor and an awareness of universal truth.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They are sensitive, which means they hurt easily, and that helped them become
alcoholics. But when they have found their restoration, they are still as sensitive
as ever &#8212; responsive to beauty and truth, and eager about the intangible
glories of this life. That makes them charming companions. And they are possessed
of a sense of universal truth that is often a new thing in their hearts. The
fact that this at-one feeling with God's universe had never been awakened in them
is sometimes the reason why they drank.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The fact that it was at last awakened is almost always the reason why
they were restored to the good and simple ways of life. Stand with them when
the meeting is over, and listen as they say the 'Our Father.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They have found a power greater than themselves which they serve diligently.
And that gives them a charm that never was elsewhere on land and sea. It makes you
know that God Himself is really charming, because the AA people reflect His
mercy and His forgiveness.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;They are imaginative, and that helped to make them alcoholics. Some
of them drank to flog their imaginations on to greater things. Others
guzzled only to black out unendurable visions that rose in their imaginations.
But when they have found their restoration, their imagination is responsive
to new thinking, and their talk abounds with color and light. And that, too,
makes them charming companions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;They are possessed of a sense of humor. Even in their cups they have
been known to say damnably funny things. Often, it was being forced to take
seriously the little and mean things of life that made them seek escape in
the bottle. But when they have found their restoration, their sense of humor
finds a blessed freedom, and they are able to reach a god-like state, where
they can laugh at themselves &#8212; at the very height of self-conquest. Go to
meetings, and listen to their laughter. What are they laughing at?
At ghoulish memories over which weaker souls would cringe in useless remorse.
And that makes them wonderful people to be with by candle-light.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;AA can, and does, show these people a solution to their problem,
and its greatest recommendation is &#8212; it works!&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Where Did Everybody Go?</i>, Paul Molloy, pages 187-189.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Wow. That is all so wonderful that we really should put whiskey in our children's
baby bottles, so that we can give them an early start on the road to alcoholism and sainthood,
where they will <i>&quot;reach a god-like state&quot;</i>.
</font>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also notice how the author gave us a huge load of Pollyanna's fluff, and then
he suddenly declared that A.A. works, based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever.
The
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie"><i><b>Big Lie</b></i></a> strikes again.

<p>
<a name="baffle"> </a>
Some A.A. members love to brag that A.A. can cure
cases of alcoholism that
baffle even the most learned and distinguished of
the real &quot;doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists&quot;
&#8212; mostly because A.A. has God and Bill Wilson and the <i>Big Book</i>
on its side, and A.A. can perform miracles.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here was a book that said I could do something that all these
doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd
been going to for years couldn't do!<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="green">
<i>Yes, Bill Wilson hand-picked stories for the <i>Big Book</i> that
said that he was such a great genius that his teachings
were better than all of the doctors and priests and ministers and
psychiatrists in the whole world, and Bill didn't even suffer from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">delusions of grandeur</a> at all,
not the least little bit...</i>
</font>
<p>
One of the favorite A.A. slogans is &quot;We are the experts on
addiction.&quot;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">The horrendous failure rate of
A.A.</a> clearly shows that they are not, but they don't want to
hear that...<br>

<a name="chosen_people"> </a>
<p>
Another popular myth is <i>&quot;God blessed the alcoholics.
Only unto them did He give the precious gift of being able to help
other alcoholics.&quot;</i>
Even worse, some A.A. members insist that they were
&quot;<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html">Chosen By God</a>&quot;,
that their period of drinking
was just God's way of preparing them for the Great Work for which
God had chosen them. Now,
those A.A. members are God's Chosen People On Earth, doing the Will
of God, while, presumably, the
rest of us aren't. To hear those nuts tell it, people who didn't
try to drink themselves to death have
missed out on all of the good stuff in life, and have missed out
on their ticket to Heaven.
<br>
<font color="green">
(<i>Too bad.  But maybe, just maybe, if we promise to drink at least two whole
fifths of cheap rotgut whiskey every
single day for the next five years, maybe we too can become some
of God's Chosen People...?</i>)
</font>

<p>
<a href="orange-sepost.html">Dr. Arthur H. Cain wrote</a> that one
example of this &quot;Chosen&quot; theme was a booklet titled
&quot;Around the Clock With A.A.&quot;, published by an
A.A. group in California, where one passage declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
God in His wisdom selected this group of men and women to be the
purveyors of His goodness... He went right to the drunkard, the
so-called weakling of the world. Well might He have said to us:
<i>&quot;Unto your weak and feeble hands I have entrusted power beyond
estimate. To you has been given that which has been denied the
most learned of your fellows. Not to scientists or statesmen, not
to wives or mothers, not even to my priests or ministers have I given
this gift of helping other alcoholics which I entrust to you.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> from: <a href="orange-sepost.html">
Dr. Arthur H. Cain's <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> article</a></font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Cain commented, &quot;Such idolatry causes the believer to see himself as all-knowing,
and turns the missionary into the zealot.&quot;
<p>

<blockquote><font color="blue">
(It turns out that the text is much older and more widely distributed than Dr. Cain
realized. Dr. Cain found it in California in the nineteen-sixties, but it
is actually from an address,
<a href="orange-Why_We_Were_Chosen.html"><i>Why We Were Chosen</i></a>,
given by Judge John T.,
at the 4th Anniversary of the Chicago Group, on October 5, 1943.)
</font></blockquote>

<p>
The <i>Little Red Book</i> of Hazelden parrots the same grandiose nonsense:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
God has entrusted recovering alcoholics with a special gift of healing
alcoholics who still suffer. This gift was not given to educators, doctors,
or clergy members; it was granted to us so we might justify our right to
live sober, normal lives by helping other alcoholics recover from their illness.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Little Red Book</i>, Hazelden, page 126.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
This whole <i>&quot;Chosen People&quot;</i> routine has a big
logical flaw: First, God gives
a bunch of people the gene for alcoholism, to make them alcoholics.
Then God gives more people the alcoholism gene so that they can
become recovering alcoholics,
and go save the first group of alcoholics. If God really doesn't want
all of those people to die of alcoholism, why not just give <b><i>none of
them</i></b> the gene for alcoholism, and solve the whole problem before
it even starts?
<p>
Bill Wilson's answer to that question is,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;The real purpose of A.A. is not to get people to quit drinking,
or to save people from alcoholism&quot;:</i></font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font> is to fit ourselves to be of

God</a>...&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 77.</font>
</blockquote>

So giving you the alcoholism gene was just God's way of forcing you to
join <i>the right religion</i> &#8212; Bill Wilson's church. Neat, huh?<br>

<p>
Bill even went on to declare that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#what2think">those alcoholics whose brains were
destroyed by alcohol were lucky</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;... The philosophy of self-sufficiency is not paying off. Plainly enough,
it is a bone-crushing juggernaut whose final achievement is ruin.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Therefore, we who are alcoholics can consider ourselves
fortunate indeed.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 37.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
Does that mean that we alcoholics are fortunate to be
<i>God's Chosen People</i>, fortunate to be
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#what2think">forced by brain damage</a> to spend
the rest of our lives in Alcoholics Anonymous,
<i>Seeking And Doing The Will Of God</i> &#8212; or the will of our sponsors?
Bill Wilson thought so.<br>
</font>
<font color="green">
Umm, sorry, but that theology is just a little too twisty
for me.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In addition, it just seems to be a common human trait that people wish to feel
that their suffering was for some higher purpose. It is a lot easier for people
to believe that they went through Hell so that they would be prepared to help
others, than to believe that they went through Hell solely because they made some
foolish choices. 
<p>
<a name="only_members_understand"> </a>
Other examples of how A.A. members think they are special:
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li> &quot;Ordinary people just don't know what it's like. They don't
really understand us at all. They don't even know when to laugh at the
punch lines of the jokes.&quot;
<li> &quot;They just don't understand.&quot;
<li> &quot;Earth people, or Normies, just don't understand.&quot;
<li> &quot;Most people can't get honest. We are the lucky ones.&quot;

<li>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When we reached A.A., and for the first time in our lives stood
among people who seemed to understand, the sense of belonging was
tremendously exciting.&quot;
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<font size="-1" color="black"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 57.</font>

</ul>
</font>

<p>
One of the reasons that the ordinary people
don't understand is because they aren't trained in the language.
They don't know all of the buzz-words and code phrases; they don't
know the new definitions of the redefined words in the &quot;loaded language&quot;.
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul><i>
<li> Those ignorant fools (ordinary people, &quot;normies&quot;) still think that
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#sobriety">sobriety</a>
means &quot;not drinking alcohol&quot; and that
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#recovery">recovery</a> means
&quot;rebuilding your health and your life while not drinking
alcohol&quot;.
<li> They don't understand how A.A. membership and the Twelve Steps
are required for both of those things.
<li> They don't understand that people who quit drinking without
doing Bill's wonderful Twelve Steps are just immoral
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunks</a>&quot;
who are &quot;only abstaining from alcohol&quot;.
</i></ul>
</font>

<p>
And &quot;ordinary people&quot; are bad for another reason: They are not
as understanding and tolerant as A.A. members are, and might criticize
you, or disapprove, or look down on you, or misunderstand, if you reveal the fact that
you are an alcoholic. So the only safe thing to do is only associate
with other A.A. members, who can be counted on to be accepting and approving and understanding.
<p>
Possibly the most outrageous way that A.A. members imagine themselves to be special is
that they think they get
<a href="orange-heresy.html#demand_miracle"><i>miracles on demand</i></a>,
and ordinary people don't.
A.A. members think that they have God constantly removing their
moral shortcomings and defects of character,
and working for them every day, taking care of their wills and their lives for them,
and constantly re-arranging the world to make life more comfortable for them.

A.A. believers imagine that God is doing such favors for A.A. members,
but not for 'normal' people,
because A.A. members are doing Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps,
and they have surrendered to the right God, and are doing the Will of God,
while 'normal' people have not:
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Step Three: Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
care of God <i>as we understood Him</i>.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#8212; And that is yet another way that A.A. members
think they are special, and different.
That is very similar to Frank Buchman's claims that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane">only Frank and
his boys were &quot;sane&quot;</a> and doing the Will of God,
while everyone else in the world was insane and wallowing in sin
because they had not joined Buchman's cult and properly
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">surrendered to
God's Guidance</a> and surrendered to &quot;God-control.&quot;
<font color="#9F0000">
(Read: surrendered to &quot;Frank-control&quot;.)
</font>
<p>

There is another huge assumption there: That God is more than
happy to answer the prayers of A.A. members; that, in fact, God
doesn't seem to really have anything better to do with His spare time than attend
A.A. meetings and wait on alcoholics.
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a>,
the leader of the Oxford Group cult, declared that
God would reveal himself to us if we asked Him to &#8212;
<i>&quot;When man listens, God speaks&quot;</i> &#8212;
and Bill Wilson believed
it and incorporated that idea into the theology of Alcoholics
Anonymous.<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When we drew near to Him He disclosed Himself to us!&quot;</font><br>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson, page 57.)</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>

But somehow, the idea that
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;God will disclose Himself&quot;
</font>
got changed into
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;God will grant all of our wishes&quot;
</font>
and
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;God will work for us, and give us miracles on demand.&quot;
</font>
<p>
The A.A. believers do not seem to bother asking why God so obviously fails
to answer the prayers of a lot of other people. No matter whether it is
the Jews in Auschwitz, the Tutsis in Africa, the children in Biafra,
Ethiopia, or Bengladesh,
the AIDS victims in Africa, or the 60,000 people who starve to death on
Earth every day, the A.A. believers seem to happily ignore the
painfully obvious fact that God isn't answering those other people's prayers.
God just lets those other people die.
<p>

The A.A. members must figure that
they are really special, and that God really likes them better, because He
will always answer their prayers, even if everybody else can just
drop dead and go to Hell.
God is supposedly always more than happy to make all of the
A.A. members quit drinking, and God is constantly playing Santa Claus for them,
removing their defects of character and
their moral shortcomings in Step Seven,
and then working all day long for them, telling them what to do in Step Eleven,
and taking
care of their wills and their lives for them in Step Three,
even if He obviously doesn't care much about whether the children
in foreign countries die of hunger and diseases...
<p>
So what makes the A.A. members so ultra-special and so privileged?

<p>
It looks like a lot of A.A. members are doing just what Bill Wilson
said they were doing:
&quot;playing spiritual make-believe.&quot;
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, Chapter 9,
page 130.)</font>

<p>
And there is still another aspect to this &quot;We Are Special&quot;
ego game:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<i>I am special because I quit drinking.</i> I am far
more spiritual than those ordinary people who are still guzzling
their beers on Friday night, because I quit drinking and now
I spend my days working for God.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Likewise, the old-timers fancy themselves wiser and more spiritual
than the
newcomers, but they hold out the hope to newcomers that they too can
make the grade if they <i>Keep Coming Back</i> for enough years,
and <i>Work A Strong Program</i>.

<p>
Institutional A.A. thinks members are special, too:
They believe that only people who are steeped in A.A. dogma are
qualified to work in treatment facilities. Most of the residential
and outpatient treatment facilities in this country are dominated
by A.A. and N.A. members, who will
not hire anyone who is not another A.A./N.A. member. This also means
that institutional A.A. and N.A. think that only people who have been
alcoholics or drug addicts are qualified to help someone else
overcome the problem. According to them, ordinary, sane,
well-balanced people who aren't addicted to 12-step meetings
are not qualified to talk about strategies for being normal,
and living healthy, successful lives. They supposedly wouldn't know
anything about that...

<i>Induction of guilt, and the use of guilt to manipulate members.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.
<p>
A.A. is so bad about guilt induction that it scores
right up there with the worst of the
<a href="orange-heresy.html#unconditional_love2">authoritarian cult religions</a>.
<p>
The Twelve Steps are great for making people muck-rake their own
lives, &quot;fearlessly&quot; searching for
things to feel guilty about, performing endless &quot;searching and fearless moral
inventories&quot; to find wrongs, defects of character,
and shortcomings, and admitting &quot;to God, to ourselves, and
to another human being the exact nature
of our wrongs.&quot;
<p>

More than half of the Twelve Steps &#8212; seven of them to be exact,
Steps Four through Ten &#8212; induce guilt by dwelling on your past sins,
moral shortcomings, defects of character, <i>the exact nature of
your wrongs</i>, and all of your offenses to others. Such guilt
makes it easier to manipulate your mind.
<p>

You must also admit in Step one that you are helpless &#8212;
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; &#8212; and have no control over your
problem.

<p>
In Step Two you <b><i>come to believe</i></b> that you are insane,
and that only &quot;Something&quot; or &quot;Someone Else&quot;,
some undefined &quot;Power greater than yourself&quot;, can fix you
&#8212; &quot;restore you to sanity.&quot;
<p>
Then, in Step Three, you must surrender your mind, your will, and
your life to God or the group or your sponsor, and let that
&quot;Something&quot; or &quot;Somebody Else&quot; do your thinking
for you.
<p>

Then you make endless lists of all of your sins, and wrongs, and
everyone you have ever harmed or offended, and confess it all to
somebody. Then Step Ten tells you to repeat that guilt-inducing
routine forever, and promptly admit when you are wrong again.

<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>You never make any lists of your good characteristics.</i>
</font>
<p>

Then they hit you with the thought-stopping clich&eacute;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Your best thinking got you here&quot;</i></font>,
a little something designed to stop your critical thinking by inducing
guilt about your past performance...
<p>

Then A.A. literature &#8212; all Bill Wilson's insane ravings &#8212; really
lays on the big guilt trip:

<font color="blue">
This is very autobiographical. I don't know about the races, but
all of the rest was true of Bill Wilson. Wilson was indulging in
psychological projection again.
<ul>
<li>
Bill Wilson was notorious for
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">philandering and 13th-stepping</a>
the pretty women who came to A.A. seeking help for alcoholism.
<li>
And Bill Wilson was a &quot;stock analyst&quot; and a stock touter, and
played the stock market.
That's
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#bad_stock3">quick money games</a>
to the max.
<li>
And it was Bill Wilson who
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">stole the <i>Big Book</i> copyright</a>
and
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund</a>, thus
double-crossing and under-cutting the other early A.A. members, especially
Henry Parkhurst.
<a href="orange-bigbook.html">
Bill Wilson took all of the credit</a> for writing &quot;the first 164 pages&quot;
of the <i>Big Book</i>, but
<!-- a href="http://199.181.80.174/index.htm" -->
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160527042411/http://www.gso.org/">Henry Parkhurst actually wrote the outline
for the whole book</a>, as well as Chapter 11, <i>To Employers</i> and
his own autobiographical story <i>The Unbeliever</i>,
and contributed to the writing of the rest of the &quot;first 164 pages&quot;.<br>

Bill refused to give Hank any credit for his work.
Then Bill stole the copyright, and refused to give anybody but himself
and Doctor Bob any share of the royalties. Then Bill conned Henry
Parkhurst out of his shares in the A.A. book publishing company, and
left Hank to die drunk and broke.
That's double-crossing and undercutting an associate.<br>

Our egomania digs two disastrous pitfalls. ...<br>

So Bill Wilson admitted that he suffered from egomania, and again
practiced psychological projection, claiming that everybody else
had his mental problems. And the <i>&quot;inability to form a true

The outcome of Bill Wilson's

died rich from the book, and &quot;Hank&quot; died dead broke.

What we must recognize now is that we exult in some of our defects.
We really love them. Who, for example, doesn't like to feel just
a little superior to the next fellow, or even quite a lot superior?
Isn't it true that we like to let greed masquerade as ambition?
To think of <i>liking</i> lust seems impossible.
But how many men and women speak love with their lips, and believe
what they say, so that they can hide lust in a dark corner of their minds?
And even while staying within conventional bounds, many people have to
admit that their imaginary sex excursions are apt to be all dressed up
as dreams of romance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Self-righteous anger can also be very enjoyable. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When gluttony is less than ruinous, we have a milder word for that, too;
we call it &quot;taking our comfort.&quot; We live in a world riddled
with envy. To a greater or lesser degree, everybody is infected with it.
From this defect we must surely get a warped yet definite satisfaction.
... And how often we work hard with no better motive than to
be secure and slothful later on &#8212; only we call it &quot;retiring.&quot;<br>

...drinkers would not take pressure in any form, excepting from John
Barleycorn himself. They always had to be led, not pushed. They
would not stand for the rather
aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group. And they
would not accept the principle
of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them. In other respects, too, we
found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little. They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts &#8212; absolute purity, absolute
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently
too much for the drunks. These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Besides, the Oxford Groups' &quot;absolutes&quot; were expressions
peculiar to them. This was a terminology which might continue
to identify us in the public mind with the Oxford Groupers, even
though we had completely withdrawn from their fellowship.<br>

<ul>
<li> Both
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB">Frank Buchman</a> and Bill Wilson held up
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_perfection"><i>&quot;An Impossible
Superhuman Model of Perfection&quot;</i></a>
&#8212; &quot;The Four Absolutes&quot; &#8212; for people to follow.
(Absolute Purity, Absolute Honesty, Absolute Love, and Absolute Unselfishness.)
That is yet another standard cult characteristic. They make you feel
guilty and inadequate because you can't live up to their super-human
standards of perfection.
<p>
<li> Note the deception inherent in that program.
Bill Wilson hid the Oxford Group origins
of Alcoholics Anonymous, and masked its religious doctrines.
Newcomers who only
want to quit drinking, not join a religion, will find out
the real truth about the program only a tiny bit at a time, &quot;by
teaspoons, not buckets.&quot;

They won't find out what membership in the group <i>really</i>
entails until later, after they have become committed,
well-indoctrinated, members.

That is
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">deceptive
recruiting</a>, another standard cult characteristic.

<p>
<li> And notice how Wilson criticized the alcoholics for not liking
the fascism inherent in Frank Buchman's
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler">Hitler-praising</a>
Oxford Groups cult religion &#8212; <br>

According to Bill Wilson, you should even feel guilty and inadequate
for not liking authoritarian fascism &#8212; you wish to &quot;cling to your
defects.&quot;
<p>
<li>
And Bill Wilson was certainly arrogant enough &#8212; in his opinion,
<i>he</i> was moral and spiritual enough to handle
lofty &quot;spiritual concepts&quot; like the Four Absolutes, even if the
other drunks could not, and <i>he</i> was qualified to teach the
Four Absolutes to others.

</font>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
Another relevant practice of A.A., in addition to the induction of
guilt, is the induction of fear
and the use of fear to manipulate members' minds. See

<i>Unquestionable Dogma, Sacred Science, and Infallible Ideology</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 10.<br>
<p>
They've got plenty of dogma and ideology: the Twelve Steps, the
Twelve Traditions, the <i>Big Book</i>, and several other publications.
And it is all true, always. If Bill Wilson wrote something in
the <i>Big Book</i>, then it is automatically, indisputably true.
The true-believer old-timers may often be heard
advising newcomers that everything one needs to know is within the first
164 pages of the Big Book (which Bill Wilson either wrote or co-wrote).
In fact, the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i> are considered to be so sacred
that those pages cannot be changed, corrected, or updated even one
little bit. The fourth edition was just published, and they didn't fix a thing
in the first 164 pages, and they won't change anything in future editions, either.

<p>
Like most cult religions,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think">A.A. practices
&quot;Group-Think&quot;</a>, and forbids any criticism of &quot;the
program.&quot; Like most cults, A.A. believes that it has unquestionable
truths, even God-given truths, so it considers any criticism of its
founders, their teachings, the organization or <i>&quot;the program&quot;</i> to be invalid &#8212;
automatically invalid and untrue, even evil, because it is against
the Will of God who dictated that infallible wisdom. Thus A.A. members call
critics &quot;AA-bashers&quot; and imagine that everything
that &quot;AA-bashers&quot; say is always wrong, and can be dismissed
out-of-hand, just because they are AA-bashers.
By this circular logic, A.A. can never be wrong, and criticism of
A.A. can never be correct. And the true believers can avoid ever
having to take any criticism of A.A. seriously, or honestly reflect
on what the critics are saying.
<p>
<a name="disservice"> </a>
A.A. members say,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;If you criticize the program, you will cause
people to relapse and die drunk, and it will all be your
fault.&quot;
</font>

That's exactly
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#too_terrible">the same argument</a> as
the Church in Rome used during the Middle
Ages to explain why you couldn't
tell the truth about all of the crimes and sins of
the Church &#8212; burning millions of women and girls as witches,
molesting the alter boys, selling everything from indulgences to
Bishop's offices, and using the Grand Inquisition
and heresy trials to silence critics &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;You can't criticize the Church, because if you do,
it will destroy the faith
of the weak people, and then they won't be able to get into
Heaven.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
Likewise, A.A. says,
<font color="#4f007f">
You can't criticize wonderful Alcoholics Anonymous:
<ul>
<li> You will kill countless alcoholics if you do.<br>
<li> The weak alcoholics will relapse and die drunk if they hear bad things
about A.A..<br>
<li> You will drive away those who &quot;might have been helped&quot;.<br>
<li> You will be <i>'doing an immense disservice to those who are
trying to achieve sobriety'</i>.<br>
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous won't work if you say that it doesn't work.
<font color="blue">
[Because, they say, it depends on a placebo effect.]</font>
</ul>
</font>

<p>
Likewise, A.A. members routinely denounce critics with
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem"><i>ad hominems</i></a> like:
<ul>
<li> &quot;You're just a big drunk who is afraid to sober up.&quot;
<li> &quot;You don't know because you don't work the Steps.&quot;
<li> &quot;You are insane.&quot;
<li> &quot;You are just an atheist.&quot;
<li> &quot;You are just nursing a resentment.&quot;
<li> &quot;You're just in it for the money.&quot;
<li> &quot;You don't care how many alcoholics you kill by criticizing Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;
</ul>
Thus, many A.A. members automatically dismiss all criticism of A.A.
without even thinking about it.

<p>
A.A. deserves and gets the 10 for the many grossly wrong or blatantly
dishonest statements in their literature, which is one
of the big differences between information and dogma. (Refusal to
correct errors being another).
<p>
And A.A. also deserves the 10 for the gross irrationality
and sheer insanity of the dogma, tenets, and beliefs,
and the members' fanatical dedication to that dogma and those beliefs.

<p>

<p><li> Step One: You are powerless over alcohol, and your life is
unmanageable.  You are not only powerless over alcohol,
<a href="orange-powerless.html">you are also powerless over
everything else, too</a>.
Powerlessness and helplessness
are raised to the level of a virtue. You proudly declare that you are
incapable of running your own life, and must be guided by something
outside of yourself, like a Higher Power, or your sponsor, or
the A.A. group.

<p><li> Step Two: You are insane and crazy, and cannot trust your own
&quot;alcoholic&quot; thinking.
Your thinking must be done for you by someone else, like your sponsor
or another old-timer.
(Oh, and the sponsors are all
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors">wise and noble selfless spiritual teachers</a>, too.)

<p><li> Step Three: You are incapable of doing a good job of running your
own life &#8212; your drinking history proves it &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Your Best Thinking Got You Here!&quot;</i></font>

so you must turn your will and your life over to &quot;the care of&quot; (the control of)
someone or something else called your &quot;Higher Power&quot;... or the A.A. group,
or your sponsor....

<p><li> Religious &quot;enthusiasm&quot; (mania, fanaticism) is the best cure for alcoholism.

<p><li> A.A. is a program of rigorous honesty. We must be rigorously
honest while discussing our own personal faults, sins, and moral
shortcomings.<br>

<font color="#4f007f">
(And <b>we must be rigorously <i>dishonest</i></b> when it comes to discussing
the obvious faults, sins,

its teachings, or its founders.)

alcohol.

<p><li> Amateur medicine is much better than professional medicine.
Some ex-drunks who have no medical training, not even any basic
scientific knowledge, who have nothing but some blind religious faith
in A.A. and the Twelve Steps,
can fix problems that baffle even the most learned and distinguished of
the real &quot;doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists&quot;.
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.)</font>

<p><li> The amateur doctors of A.A. are qualified to decide which
prescription medicines the newcomers should take or stop taking.
It is perfectly proper for sponsors to tell their sponsees to stop
taking the pills that the real doctor gave them, because
<font color="#4f007f"><i>&quot;You have
to stop taking all medications if you want to <b>really</b> be in
recovery.&quot;</i></font>

<p><li> Sober <i>TIME</i> equals wisdom and knowledge. The words of
someone with six years of sobriety are twice as true and important as
the words of someone with three years.  And someone who has twenty years
of sobriety is like unto a saint, and he can hardly ever be wrong about
anything.

<p><li> Confession is necessary for spiritual progress.
<p><li> Prayer is necessary for recovery from alcoholism.

<p><li> You must have Blind Faith,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#small_child">like a small child</a>,
if you want to quit drinking.

<p><li> You must <b>surrender</b> your mind, your will, and your life to God and A.A..
<p><li> You can give away and take back your will, as if it were a coin or
a token. You can <i>willfully</i> take your will back even when you
don't have a will (because you gave it away).

<p><li> You have numerous &quot;defects of character&quot; (a.k.a.

<i>&quot;All Twelve Steps of A.A. are designed to kill the

</font>

<p><li> The way to overcome alcoholism is to spend the rest of your life
being preoccupied with it, constantly attending meetings with other
alcoholics, and talking about alcohol and alcoholism,
and doing A.A. busywork, like the Twelve Steps and recruiting new members.

<p><li> Someone who quits drinking alcohol all on his own, without
the benefit of the Twelve Steps, will turn into a bitterly unhappy and immoral
&quot;<a href="orange-drydrunk.html">dry drunk</a>&quot;.

<p><li> If you don't work the Twelve Steps, you will die drunk, soon.
A man who fails to perform all of the <i>suggested</i> Steps to the best of his ability
signs his own death warrant.
<font size="-1">(<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William G. Wilson, page 174.)</font>

<p><li> Alcoholics cannot bear the thought of really quitting drinking forever.
They are so feeble-minded that they can only handle the thought of
quitting drinking for just one day at a time.

<p><li> Apparently, God is also just as feeble-minded, because He
can't cure any
alcoholics for more than just one day at a time, either.
Every new day is another day when the alcoholic must strike a bargain
with God, begging God to give him
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#daily_vision">another 24-hour
reprieve</a> from his perpetual alcoholic death sentence in trade
for doing God's will, or cult busywork, all day long.

<p><li> The families of alcoholics suffer from a &quot;spiritual
disease&quot; called &quot;codependency&quot; which is caused by
being related to an alcoholic, and they must also join the Twelve-Step
religion, and go to a branch of the church
called &quot;Al-Anon&quot; to get &quot;treatment&quot; for their
condition.

<p><li> Resentments cause &quot;spiritual&quot; diseases. You cannot
have any resentments at all, not against anyone, not even if
someone robs, cheats, beats, or rapes you.

<p><li> Strong emotions are bad. A good A.A. member must learn to
&quot;stuff his feelings&quot; and always maintain an even emotional
state characterized by Serenity and Gratitude.

<p><li> Practicing the Twelve Steps makes you full of <i>Serenity</i>
and <i>Gratitude</i>.

<p><li> Going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings is spiritual growth.

<p><li> Alcoholics absolutely must go to lots and lots of A.A. meetings,
or else they will relapse and die drunk.

<p><li>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous, as such, ought never be organized.&quot;</i>
</font>
That is <b>&quot;Tradition Nine&quot;</b>.<br>
<font color="blue" size="-1">
Please just ignore the fact that Alcoholics Anonymous is totally organized.
It is legally incorported into three non-profit corporations: Alcoholics Anonymouus World Services, Inc.,
The General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous, and The Grapevine.

city offices all over the world; it has a national council;
it has executives and a board of trustees and a board of directors,

<p><li> Bill Wilson is better than Jesus Christ for saving your life from
alcoholism.

<p><li> When God gives people a will at birth, He also gives them an R.M.A.
(Return Materials Authorization), so that they can send their wills back
to the factory whenever they get tired of having them.
(The same rule also applies to having a mind, or brains, or a life of your own.)

<p><li> For every problem there is a simple one-line answer.
All of life's problems, even the most complex problems,
can be answered with simplistic slogans and thought-stopping clich&eacute;s.
Slogan-slinging is a good way to discuss the deadly condition called alcoholism.

<p><li> There is a panacea. There is a simple, one-size-fits-all
quick fix for alcoholism, and for all of the other big problems of
life, too.

<p><li>
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_cult_speak">Words can mean whatever
A.A. or Bill Wilson wants them to mean</a>.
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak">
Redefining words willy-nilly</a> and loading the language is a
perfectly good way to treat alcoholism.

<p><li> The purpose of Alcoholics Anonymous is to help people
quit drinking. But then again, no it isn't. Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order.
But this is not an end in itself.
<font color="#9F0000">Our real purpose</font> is to fit ourselves to be of
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#realpurp">maximum service to
God</a>...&quot;
</font>
<font size="-1">(<i>Big Book</i>, page 77.)</font>

<p><li> William Griffith Wilson was a brilliant spiritual man,
inspired by God, not a mentally ill man who was a textbook case of
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#diagnosis">297.10 Delusional
(Paranoid) Disorder, Grandiose Type</a>&quot; and
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic">301.81
Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>&quot;.

<p><li> And Doctor Robert Smith was a great and wise man, not a neurotic
dogmatic religious fanatic whose brain was so wrecked by alcohol that he was
incapable of supporting his wife while working as a doctor.
Both Wilson and Smith didn't have to be
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#wilson_income">supported by A.A.
handouts</a> for the rest of their lives.

<p><li> The answer to everything is
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<b>Go to Meetings, Get a Sponsor,
Do the Twelve Steps, and Read the Big Book</b>.&quot;
</font>

<p><li> It is proper behavior, and morally correct, to withhold
the truth from newcomers, in order to avoid
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#arouse_prejudice">
&quot;confusing them&quot; or &quot;arousing their prejudices&quot;</a>,
while we <b><i>keep them coming back</i></b> for more indoctrination.
<p><li> Alcoholics and addicts have &quot;triggers&quot;, which are
sights, sounds, or smells that they have associated with drinking or
drugging. When an alcoholic or addict experiences one of these sensations,
he immediately goes into ecstatic recall and is hit with an intense wave of
craving that he cannot resist &#8212; because he is <i>powerless</i>, remember? &#8212;
so he automatically relapses and gets happily stoned out of his gourd,
and it is all somebody else's fault for putting the trigger in his path.
<p><li> There is only one way to deal with life's ups and downs and hard knocks,
and it is mandatory:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Get to a meeting as soon as possible.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="blue">
[In other words, reinforce the big lie &#8212; the lie that says
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Because I am defective &#8212; because I have <i>character defects which only God
can remove</i>, I am incapable of handling the stress of everyday
life and must rely on others to do it for me.&quot;</font>]
</font>

<p><li> Alcoholics Anonymous and the Twelve Steps are the <i>only</i> way
to recover from alcoholism. Nothing else works.

<p><li> Even if the Twelve Steps turn out to be useless for
treating alcoholism, they are still wonderful, and should be
practiced by everyone, because they make people seek and do
the Will of God. (Which makes A.A. and the Twelve Steps the
<b><i>right</i></b> spiritual practices, and all of the other
religions in the world wrong, because they don't seek and do
the Will of God through the Twelve Steps.)

<p><li> Thinking about all of this, and trying to understand it, is a
bad thing. It is called &quot;Stinkin' Thinkin'.&quot;
What you should do is:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Utilize, Don't Analyze.&quot;
&quot;Keep It Simple, Stupid!&quot;
</font>

<p><li> Being intelligent, and able to think, is a bad thing.
The slogan is,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Nobody is too stupid to get the
program, but some people are too intelligent.&quot;
</font>

<p><li> You can't survive without total faith in Alcoholics Anonymous.
If you stop believing in Bill Wilson and the Twelve Steps, you will
have to drink over it.
You can't possibly abstain from drinking alcohol without
believing in Bill Wilson and his version of God.

<i>Appeals to &quot;holy&quot; or &quot;wise&quot;
authorities.</i></b></font><br>
A.A. scores a 7.<br>
<p>
This is a split decision;
A.A. feels itself to be such a self-contained authority on
everything, that it does not make a lot of appeals to any
current outside authorities. However, the <i>Big Book</i>, A.A.'s own
Bible, contains direct or indirect
endorsements by Dr. William D. Silkworth, M.D.,
John D. Rockefeller, Jr.,
<a href="orange-letters2.html#rowland">Dr. Carl Jung</a>,
Father Edward Dowling, S.J., Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, as well as five other
doctors in the Chapter &quot;The Medical View on A.A.&quot;.
<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous <i>claims to have</i> a few standard outside
endorsements, like Carl Jung and Aldous Huxley, but...
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Carl_Jung">Carl Jung never really endorsed A.A.</a>;
A.A. just likes to claim that they implemented some of Jung's ideas, which is not true.

<li>
A.A. promoters often mention TIME magazine, which declared that Bill Wilson was
one of the 100 most influential people of the Twentieth Century. But so
was Adolf Hitler.

<li>
Bill Wilson <i>claimed</i> that Aldous Huxley once commented that he thought
Bill Wilson was &quot;the greatest social engineer of the Twentieth
Century.&quot; But that boast has never been verified. Nowhere in Huxley's
books or papers is there any such praise of Bill Wilson or Alcoholics Anonymous.
And there is no other source of Bill's claim than Bill's own bragging.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
You would think that &quot;the greatest social engineer of the Twentieth
Century&quot; should have rated at least a small paragraph in something or other
that Huxley wrote. (How about some A.A. meetings on <i>Island</i>? No, but they
did have psychedelic sessions and sex lessons there. Apparently Huxley did not
consider A.A. to be part of his ideal Utopian society.)
<li>
Bill may have been spinning yarns and telling more of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery">his grandiose tall tales</a>
again.
<li>
It isn't entirely clear in just what sense Huxley might have meant that,
if he did say something like that.
Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Chairman Mao Tse Tung
could also be considered contenders for that title of &quot;Social Engineer&quot;.
They were also good at manipulating people.

<li>
Also, Huxley wasn't above examining and testing anything, but that doesn't mean
that he was endorsing or recommending it. Huxley was
also one of the first investigators of Scientology in England, and
was one of the first &quot;clears&quot;. But Scientology doesn't
talk about that any more, because Huxley went on to criticize
Scientology.
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
At A.A. meetings, there are always <b>lots</b> of appeals to the
<i>Big Book</i> and other A.A. publications, especially the writings of
Bill Wilson like <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, and
<i>As Bill Sees It</i>. At almost every meeting, someone is reading
from those &quot;holy scriptures&quot;, and delivering a sermon on
the subject.

<p>
Institutional A.A. often points to
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html">&quot;scholarly&quot; or
&quot;scientific&quot; articles</a> that support the twelve-step
treatment program as <a href="orange-pseudo2.html">good medicine</a>.
What they don't tell you is that most all of those articles were written
by other hidden A.A. members who were <a href="orange-coffee.html#recproc">anything
but</a> scientific in their analysis and conclusions.
Likewise, A.A. boosters also often cite pro-A.A. pseudo-scientific
statements from A.A.'s own front groups like ASAM (the American
Society of Addiction Medicine), NCADD (the National Council on
Alcoholism and Drug Dependence), and NAADAC (the National
Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors).

<p>
As is common in many cults,
<a href="orange-big_lie.html#Vaillant1">those self-proclaimed
&quot;authorities&quot; often cite each other</a>
as experts who agree that Alcoholics Anonymous is wonderful.
It is a mutual admiration society of circular references.

Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
How many times have we
heard well-intentioned people claim the guidance of God when it
was all too plain that they were sorely mistaken?
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Surely then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves.<br>

greater than you, who have not even come close to a solution. Surely you can have faith in

A.A. founder Bill Wilson also wrote this piece of twisted illogic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Every man and woman who has joined A.A. and intends to stick has, without realizing it,
made a beginning on Step Three. Isn't it true that, in all matters touching upon alcohol,
each of them has decided to turn his or her life over to the care, protection,
and guidance of A.A.?<br>

<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, page 35.<br>
<i>As Bill Sees It</i>, A.A.W.S. staff, page 328.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, the answer to Bill's question is
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;No. That is not true &#8212; not true at all.
Someone who has come to A.A. to get some help and advice for quitting drinking
is not at all the same thing as someone who has decided to surrender
control of his entire life to a cult.&quot;</font><br>
<p>
Bill was just trying to fool people with two propaganda tricks:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#false_equality"><i>False Equality</i></a> &#8212; assert that
two different things are the same thing &#8212; and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions">
<i>Sly Suggestions</i></a> &#8212; just suggest that something might be true... (and then later
start assuming that it is of course unquestionably true...)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bill continued, and rationalized that surrender to the cult, and dependence on the cult, was not
psychologically harmful:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We realize that the word &quot;dependence&quot; is as distasteful to many psychiatrists
and psychologists as it is to alcoholics. Like our professional friends, we, too, are aware that
there are wrong forms of dependence. ... But dependence upon an A.A. group or upon a Higher
Power hasn't produced any baleful results.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So how, exactly, can the willing person continue to turn his will and his life over
to the Higher Power? ... His lone courage and unaided will cannot do it. Surely he must now
depend on Somebody or Something else.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At first that &quot;somebody&quot; is likely to be his closest A.A. friend. ...
Of course the sponsor points out that our friend's life is still unmanageable even
though he is sober, that after all, only a bare start on A.A.'s program has been made.<br>

(What Bill Wilson neglected to tell his readers is that when he wrote

surrender to the cult (&quot;spiritual army&quot;) and just obey orders:

<blockquote>

&quot;I will center my thoughts on a Higher Power. I will surrender all to
his power within me. I will become a soldier for this power, feeling the
might of the spiritual army as it exists in my life today. I will allow
a wave of spiritual union to connect me through my gratitude, obedience,
and discipline to this Higher Power. Let me allow this power to lead me
through the orders of the day.&quot;<br>

Surrender is not just physical. It isn't just a matter of obedience to
the leaders or elders or founders' commandments .
There are also appeals for <i>intellectual</i> surrender, where
people stop thinking and stop asking critical questions.

Likewise, an Al-Anon book of daily meditations teaches the wives and children of alcoholics
how to mindlessly &quot;free-fall&quot; &#8212; to surrender their whole lives
&#8212; <i>everything</i> &#8212; to the cult,
and live lives that are &quot;truly powerless&quot;:

Steps One, Two and Three opened doors to profound and meaningful changes.
The effects of being raised in an alcoholic family seemed as fixed in me as my eye color.
Two traits come to mind &#8212; turning to emotionally unavailable people for support,
and engaging in self-doubt and self-hate. With the help of my sponsor,
I now see that these and other traits, not other people, are the source of my
anguish.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That insight, however, was only the beginning.
The real freedom came when I finally admitted I couldn't get better on my own,
which lifted my denial. My powerlessness filled my lungs, brushed my skin,
beat in tandem with my heart. I stood at the edge of acceptance, took a step,
and free-fell into Step One. I realized that if only I could remember I was
truly powerless over these effects and not try to pretend otherwise, I would
be fine.
Why? Because of Step Two. A Power greater than myself can help me.

will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may

had made a complete surrender, that I had really turned my life over
that summer. I thought I had done that until Russ' second collapse,
and the doctor told me very candidly that he wasn't long for this world.
I knew then that I hadn't made a complete surrender, because I tried to
bargain with the God I had found, and I said, &quot;Anything but that!

<b>&quot;Surrender&quot;</b> is so ballyhooed that it is a key term in

and also to go out and help other men who needed it.
This was in the form of a prayer group.
Several of the boys would pray together, and the new man
would make his own prayer, asking God to take alcohol out
of his life, and when he was through,
he would say, &quot;Thank you, God, for taking it out
of my life.&quot; During the prayer, he usually made a declaration of his
willingness to turn his life over to God.<sup><font size="-1">48</font></sup><br>

<p>
Such prayer was always done in a circle, with everyone on their knees.

<p>
Ernie Galbraith, Dr. Bob's son-in-law, A.A. Number 4, and author of the Big Book
first edition story <i>The Seven-Month Slip</i>,
described the early meetings at T. Henry's house this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;... we were taking them upstairs and getting them on their knees to surrender,
which I felt was a very important part.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The surrender was more than important; it was a must. Bob E., who came into A.A.
in February 1937, recalled that after five or six days in the hospital, &quot;when
you had indicated that you were serious, they told you to get down on your
knees by the bed and say a prayer to God admitting you were powerless over
alcohol and your life was unmanageable. Furthermore, you had to state that you
believed in a Higher Power who would return you to sanity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;There you can see the beginning of the Twelve Steps,&quot;
he said. &quot;We called that the surrender. They demanded it. You couldn't
go to a meeting until you did it. If by accident you didn't make it in the
hospital, you had to make it in the upstairs bedroom over at the Williamses' house.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Dorothy S. M. recalled the 1937 meetings when &quot;the men would all
disappear upstairs and all of us women would be nervous and worried about
what was going on. After about half an hour or so, down would come the new man,
shaking, white, serious, and grim. And all the people who were already
in A.A. would come trooping down after him. They were pretty reluctant to
talk about what had happened, but after a while, they would tell us they
had had a <i>real</i> surrender.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I often wonder how many people that come in now would survive an experience
like that &#8212; a regular old-fashioned prayer meeting,&quot; said Dorothy,
who was then married to an A.A. member, Clarence S., and later came into A.A.
herself.<br>

<p>
Likewise, Ernest Kurtz reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The formal &quot;meetings&quot; continued to be held each Wednesday
evening at the large Westfield home of T. Henry and Clarace Williams,
the alcoholics at times making up almost half of the group as the
year 1937 drew to a close. The sober alcoholics referred to themselves
as &quot;the alcoholic squadron of the Oxford Group.&quot; ...
The expression furnished an important group identity.
It was &quot;the meeting&quot; to which new prospects could be
brought after they had &quot;made surrender&quot; (or even at times
to &quot;make surrender&quot; in a small basement room before the
meeting began)...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Not-God</i>, Ernest Kurtz, page 56.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
At this point, you might be wondering, &quot;What kind of nuts were
these people?
Did they all keep some special room upstairs, or in the basement, just for
people to surrender in?&quot; The answer is,
<font color="blue">
&quot;Yes, they were
really some seriously twisted hard-core religious fanatics.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Bill Wilson described more surrenders to the cult at T. Henry's house this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many a man, yet dazed from his hospital experience, has stepped over the
threshold of that home into freedom. Many an alcoholic who entered there
came away with an answer.
<font color="#9F0000">He succumbed to that gay crowd inside</font>, who
laughed at their own misfortunes and understood his. Impressed by those
who visited him at the hospital,
<font color="#9F0000">he capitulated entirely</font>

man whose experience closely tallied with his own.<br>

<p>
Ernest Kurtz also reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Bob E.'s last act before leaving the hospital was straight out of
Oxford Group practice: he &quot;made a surrender.&quot; On his knees
at his bedside, Dr. Smith standing over him, Bob &quot;shared
completely &#8212; it [has] to be done with another person. Pray and
share out loud. The act of surrender ... You couldn't attend a meeting
unless you had gone through that. You couldn't just go to a
meeting &#8212; you had to go through the program of surrender.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Not-God</i>,
Ernest Kurtz, page 54.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

<p>
This was &quot;Doctor Bob&quot; Smith's method of handling alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Often, wives would call. The alcoholic squad would find out about the
prospect, his family situation, his job situation, and the nature of his
drinking.
Then the prospect himself would be approached; and there was a
sharing of experience &#8212; just as Bill did with Dr. Bob and Ebby
did with Bill.
Following this preliminary questioning, the new prospect would be
hospitalized and &quot;defogged&quot; for five to ten days &#8212; often
with substantial doses of paraldehyde.
Patients were given only a Bible as reading material.
They would then be visited by several alcoholics who
shared their experience. Dr. Bob
emphasized hospitalization. He was
hospitalization-oriented, and believed alcoholism to be a disease.
The recovered alcoholics who visited the new person had a

Dr. Bob would often visit; and his part centered around three items:
<ul>
<li> a) He would explain the medical and disease aspects to the new person.
<li> b) He would inquire about the person's belief in God &#8212; a God of love.
<li> c) He usually asked the newcomer to make a decision. If
the newcomer agreed
to go along, he was required to admit that he was powerless over
alcohol and then to surrender his will to God &#8212; on his knees &#8212; with
prayer &#8212; in the presence of one or more of the alcoholic
squad.<sup><font size="-1">55</font></sup>

It's interesting that no one seems to have been bothered by the obvious
contradiction: alcoholism is a disease that requires
hospitalization, but the cure is not medicine, it is to get
on your knees and pray to God in the hospital?
<p>
Besides detoxing or &quot;defogging&quot; the alcoholics, another purpose
of such hospitalizations was simply to isolate the patient
and turn him into a captive audience.
<a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_total_immersion"><i>Total immersion
and total isolation</i></a>
is a standard mind-control technique that cults use to convert newcomers.
The hospitalized patient was allowed no reading material
but the Bible. The Oxford Group practice
was to allow no visitors but Oxford Group members. The text here does not
make it clear whether any non-A.A. visitors were allowed, but obviously,
the patient was overwhelmed with &quot;alcoholic squad&quot;
visitors whose purpose was
to indoctrinate and convert him. They worked on him in shifts
until he capitulated
and surrendered to Dr. Bob on his knees.

<a name="surrender_hospital"> </a>
<p>
Nan Robertson gave a similar description of Doctor Bob's method of
treating new alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Hospitalization was considered to be a must. Bob would circumvent
hospital rules against putting alcoholics in private rooms by
concocting another diagnosis and smuggling them in so that he could
work on likely prospects without distractions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The doctor and his recovering alcoholic friends would pay frequent
visits to the bedside. They told their drinking stories. Patients
would reply, as one of them reported, &quot;That's me. That's me.
I drink like that.&quot; Usually the sick man would spend five or six
days in the hospital being detoxified (medically withdrawn from
alcohol). In the final days his visitors would ask the prospect
to give over his life &quot;to the care and direction of the
Creator.&quot; Then the man would get down on his knees. When he
&quot;surrendered to God,&quot; he was considered a member.
Those who did not &quot;make their surrender&quot; in the hospital
did it soon afterward at an Oxford Group meeting, usually in the
home of T. Henry and Clarace Williams.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Williamses were an Akron couple &#8212; generous and &quot;a bit
churchy,&quot; Dorothy Seiberling said &#8212; who opened their house
every Wednesday night to the Oxford Group and its growing band of
alcoholics. Young Bob [Dr. Bob's son], in frequent attendance,
described the scene:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Swiss,Sanserif">
They'd take the guy upstairs and bore in on him. The Catholics
in the group didn't like that kind of open confession. Then after
a while the new member, looking shaken, would come down to the
living room where the wives and us kids were waiting. We'd all sit
around on chairs and the members would share and we'd all pray.
It was kind of like an old-fashioned revival meeting.

<p>
And isn't it especially fortunate that Higher Power is busy saving the lives
of white American members of Alcoholics Anonymous, rather than wasting His time on
sick and starving brown and black children on the other side of the world, who apparently
don't get a second chance?
<p>
And then there are the people who are so in love with Alcoholics Anonymous
that they proclaim in meetings that they are so grateful for being addicts
that they wouldn't take a pill to reverse the condition even if one was available.

There is always someone raving about how it's a <b><i>Miracle</i></b>
that he is there, at the meeting,
sober, against all odds, and isn't God wonderful to have done
that? It seems like nobody ever says
that it was inevitable that he would quit drinking, because he
was just so sick and tired of being sick
and tired; it is always a &quot;Miracle&quot; when somebody
manages to stay sober for a while:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">

<p>
<blockquote>

Assume on the other hand that father has, at the outset, a
stirring spiritual experience. Overnight, as it were, he is a different
man. He becomes a religious enthusiast. He is unable to focus on anything
else.  As soon as his sobriety begins to be taken as a matter of course, the family may look at their strange new dad with apprehension, then with irritation. There is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and night. He may demand that the family find God in a hurry, or
exhibit amazing indifference to them and say he is above worldly considerations. He may tell mother, who has been religious all her life, that she doesn't know
what it's all about, and that she had better get his brand of spirituality while there is yet time.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When father takes this tack, the family may react unfavorably.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
They suspect father is a bit balmy!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He is not so unbalanced as they might think.

I don't know if this frail human body and spirit can handle the awesome
power of this program.  Talk about a spiritual awakening.  I've been kind
of sitting on the 6th and 7th steps, as well as the 1st part of the 5th,
primarily because they are so intangible.  Our last Saturday's meeting was
on the 6th and I came away feeling I had almost worked through that one,
but maybe not just quite.
<p>
From the opening chord on the organ for the prelude the Ash Wednesday
service yesterday was so intense for me I almost could not perform my part
as a member of the choir in the service.  Everything just seemed to come
together.  It is impossible to put in words what the music was and did ...
and, even stranger yet, I found at the end that it was completely
improvised by the organist and would be impossible ever to hear again!
Almost immediately after the prelude was a set of confessional prayers &#8212;
by the time we were half way through them I realized I was doing those 5th,
6th, and 7th steps then and there and I still choke up as I write this with
how I felt.  And the feeling continued throughout the service; even the
short sermon, about which I can remember very little, seemed aimed directly
at me and where I was in the AA program. As I recall,
I could find all of the 12 steps, each in its own way, somewhere in that single
service &#8212; quite unintentionally, but also so natural and powerfully.

I think this is where men generally have a harder
time with the program than women (he said, slightly taken aback by his
willingness to make so broad a generalization in public):
I think men have a
tougher time feeling their intuitions and trusting them, but
I think this is
where one is led eventually via the 10th, 11th and 12th steps.

I wondered if it could be real,<br>
that there were sweet mansions eternal,<br>
way off, out there beyond the blue...<br>

in absolutely stirring, hair-raising beautiful three part harmony.<br>
And then Max and Hiram drink
some more beer and I pop another diet coke, and we do another one.<br>
