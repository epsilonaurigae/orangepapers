Dr. Frank Buchman believed that the age of miracles had returned,
that people could have direct, personal access to God, that people
could be &quot;changed&quot;, and that confession was necessary for
&quot;change&quot;.
Frank Buchman also declared that people were essentially weak and sinful &#8212;
&quot;defeated by sin&quot;, he called it &#8212; and that only
&quot;surrender to God&quot; and becoming totally &quot;controlled by God&quot; would save them.
<p>
<a name="Van_Dusen1"> </a>
Henry P. Van Dusen, writing for The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine in 1934,
described Buchmanism, a.k.a. &quot;The Oxford Group Movement&quot;, this way:
<p>
<center>
<table width="95%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="20">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The fundamental premise which determines every aspect of its emphasis
and work is this conviction &#8212; that
<font color="blue">
in the modern world the over-whelming
majority of folk have sadly missed the way</font>.
Many of them consciously
unhappy, inwardly defeated, and insulated from their fellows by secret
barriers of sham, impurity, or fear. Others are pitiably superficial,
selfish, and futile. A very few are sincere, but palpably inadequate.
For all alike, the need is for a radical and revolutionary
experience of personal religion. For all alike, there is possible
a new life of hitherto unknown power and unbelievable satisfaction.<br>
<a name="surrender"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="blue">
But there is only one avenue of access to that higher life.</font>
It is through a radical purging of inner unreality and
<font color="blue">the full and final surrender of one's whole self</font>,
all that one is and all that one possesses, to the imperious command of
the Living God.
<font color="blue">
From that surrender, when complete and unreserved, will follow release from
defeat or ennui and the gift of utterly new joy and strength.</font>

The old life will be cast away; the old harrowing problems will dissolve;
one will stand
free from the shackles of temptation, self-consciousness, selfishness;
for the first time in one's life, one will know the meaning of spiritual
freedom. All that one has heard with the hearing of the ears about the life
of religion, all that one has dismissed as the familiar exaggeration of
religious propagandists or na&iuml;ve faith no longer possible for
intelligent moderns &#8212; all this will come vividly alive within one's own
soul. One now <i>knows</i>, with a certainty for which there is no
parallel, the truth of religion's claims &#8212; the absolutely unique
character of the dedicated life, the vivid and continuous awareness of
God's presence, the priceless worth of complete fellowship with Him,
the service which is perfect freedom.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Together with these results,
<font color="blue">
surrender will also bring two quite
definite gifts &#8212; direct and specific instructions from God Himself
for every detail of daily speech and life (what the Groups term
'guidance'); and the ability to bring others into the same transforming
experience.</font>

Indeed, just as
<font color="blue">the only way of entrance into the new life
is through complete surrender</font>, so there is
<font color="blue">one way and one way only</font>
by which that new life may be maintained vivid and growing.

It is through revealing one's own discoveries in intimate disclosure
to others and thus winning them to similar surrender and rebirth.
Finally, the matrix within which this whole process of life transformation
in its three phases &#8212; surrender of self, continuance in complete
commitment, the winning of others &#8212; can best take place is an intimate
comradeship of completely like-minded and like-dedicated persons.<br>

<p>
Notice the repeated phrases <i>&quot;the only way&quot;</i>,
and <i>&quot;one way and one way only&quot;</i>.
That is one of the first and most obvious characteristics of any cult.
They almost always claim that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank">they have <i>the only way</i></a>
&#8212; the only way to Heaven, or to salvation, or spirituality, or eternal
bliss, or higher knowledge, or sanity, or mental powers, or recovery,
or
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_promises" target="_blank">whatever it is that
the cult promises to deliver</a>...
<p>
A corollary to cults' claims of having <i>The Only Way</i> is the assertion that
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_enemy" target="_blank">&quot;the other people&quot; do
not have <i>The Way</i></a>. &quot;They&quot; are
all misguided and missing the boat, and &quot;they&quot; won't be going to Heaven (or
whatever the declared goal of the cult happens to be). Thus the cult encourages an
isolationist &quot;us versus them&quot; mindset, which naturally segues into
an attitude that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">the cult members are
special</a> &#8212; that they are
superior to the common rabble who haven't been &quot;saved&quot; and who don't have
<i>The Big Answer</i>....

<p>
Another common cult characteristic shown there is the demand for
<i><a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult" target="_blank">Surrender to the Cult</a></i>.
You can't just join the group; you have to surrender to the cult and give
it everything &#8212; your life, your mind, your heart, your loyalty,
your obedience, and even your soul.

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="Groupism"> </a>
The first and most obvious characteristic of Buchmanism was
meetings, meetings, meetings. The
Buchmanites were always forming groups and having lots of
meetings, just like Alcoholics Anonymous would do
decades later. A slang term that some others used for Buchmanism was
&quot;Groupism&quot; &#8212; the religion of those people who believe in
groups and meetings.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The early house-parties attracted varying numbers, from twenty to 150.
Sometimes they were week-end affairs; sometimes they were prolonged for ten days.
Young people in the twenties predominated. It was the practice, I believe,
for them to contribute 5<i>s</i>. a head as &quot;registration fee.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The purpose of house-parties, it was stated, was to &quot;relate modern
individuals to Jesus Christ in terms which they understand and in an environment
which they find congenial.&quot;
There were &quot;informal talks on sin,&quot; and a feature of those
days, apparently, was separate groups for men and women for the discussion
of sex problems &quot;in a more intimate vein than is possible in a
mixed gathering.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
Frank Buchman always maintained that converts should remain in their
own church. New people may be converted to believing in Buchmanism,
but they were supposed to continue as members of their original
church while simultaneously attending numerous Group meetings.
Buchman declared that his sect was not a new religion, but rather something
that would supplement and revitalize the existing Christian churches &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;The Oxford Group is not a new religion; it is religion anew.&quot;</font>

That seemingly generous attitude had the side effect of
making everyone, no matter what their religion, fair game for
conversion to Buchmanism, and their former church couldn't even
complain about losing a member.
<p>
But one contemporary noticed that, while the Oxford Group claimed to not
be in competition with other churches, many Oxford Group meetings were
scheduled for
Sunday morning, at an hour which prevented O.G. members from attending
the services of other churches, even if they wanted to...

<p><br><center><img src="https://www.orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

<a name="confessions1"> </a>
An important part of the Buchmanite meetings was
confession and &quot;sharing.&quot;
There were two distinctly different kinds of sharing:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
1) sharing as confession, and<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
2) sharing for witness.<br>
Sharing as confession was supposed to unburden one of the sins which Buchmanites
declared kept people separated from God,
while sharing for witness was intended to convince new prospects to join the Group
and &quot;surrender to God&quot;. That is, sharing for witness was just a lot of testimonials
that were intended to convince newcomers that Buchmanism is <i>the answer</i>.

<p>
The Buchmanites were really big on public confession, and were always
openly confessing everything they had ever done to meeting rooms full
of strangers. They entertained their
audiences with wild, humorous, and sometimes licentious
stories of their sins, misadventures and escapades before they got
changed into moral people by Frank Buchman and his followers.
And converts would &quot;share&quot; the message
that their lives had been much improved
by following Frank's &quot;Guidance&quot; and &quot;principles&quot;.

<p>
<a name="Geoffrey_Allen_1"> </a>
Rev. Geoffrey Allen was a leader and a true believer in the Oxford Group
Movement who attempted to explain and rationalize all of the practices of the Oxford
Groups, like receiving Guidance from God in s&eacute;ances
and &quot;sharing&quot; sins with others
who are not ordained priests or ministers.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As first created by God, the infant has a transparent purity of soul.
In early childhood, how early who can say, the devil passes by.
Fear and pride and self-will enter in.
The child becomes ashamed and fears to confess its shame.
The evil by the great illusion is buried deep within the personality.
The poison of repressed fear or shame festers in the depths of
the soul.
Then there must come the healing work of God. Man must be converted,
not with an empty change of opinions, but with the turning inside out of
his life. Sins must be confessed openly on the lips, that they may be
purified in God's fair air, and that so there may be room for His gift
of love and peace within the newly cleansed heart.<br>

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Sooner or later, when we are ready to receive it, the Spirit will lead us
to a deeper sharing of all that has been weighing on us from the past.
It is a healthy practice for everyone, when they are led by God to do so,
to share to the depths whatever in the past has most burdened their memory
with thoughts of guilt. Such deep sharing may often be of things of which
it is a shame to speak in public, and it will be right to accept the guidance
of the Spirit, and to share with some one older individual. Such an individual
will then stand to us as ambassador of the forgiveness of Christ. In a Church
which was fully Christian the natural person to whom to take such confession
would be the priest.
<font color="blue">
Whether in the actual Church the priest is always the
right person is questionable. He might be shocked; and that might be good
neither for him nor for us.</font>
The person who receives such confession
<font color="blue">must be someone who has learnt from his own
experience</font>, both under the Cross and
in the Christian fellowship, that the forgiveness of Christ outreaches the
furthest sin of man.
<font color="blue">
He will therefore never be shocked; before the utmost
evil he will say without blame, as Christ would say: 'Thy sins are forgiven;
go and sin no more.'</font><br>

<p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Notice how Rev. Geoffrey Allen implied that non-clergy (i.e., Oxford
Group members) were more qualified, or at least better equipped, than
ordained clergy to hear confessions, because they wouldn't be shocked
by what they heard.
Rev. Allen declared that the poor innocent cloistered feeble-minded old
priests might be harmed by shocking confessions, but some worldly,
experienced old degenerates from the back alleys could handle the job
with ease.
<p>
<li>
Rev. Allen also claimed that the people who heard the confessions must be experienced
sinners who have learned about the sin from their own experience.<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>So let's see... Logically,
Catholic priests can't hear confessions about wild sexual affairs unless they have
had a few dozen themselves... And murderers can only confess their sins
to another experienced murderer... Right?</i>
</font>
<p>
<li>
Rev. Allen also claimed that unordained non-clergy (like Oxford Group members)
had the power to forgive and absolve sins in the name of Jesus Christ
&#8212; that they could
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;stand to us as ambassador of the forgiveness of Christ&quot; &#8212;
&quot;Thy sins are forgiven; go and sin no more.&quot;</i></font> &#8212;
which is a new religious doctrine that will certainly
start some interesting theological debates:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Who needs seminaries or trained clergy? Who needs ordained
ministers and priests? Some college dropouts with
a couple of months of indoctrination in cult religion should be good
enough...&quot;</i></font>
<font color="blue">
<p>
<i>That shows typical cultish arrogance. Cult members like to claim that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">they are special</a>,
and somehow more qualified than ordinary people &#8212;
even more qualified than the experts or the professionals.</i>
Like an A.A. member declared, after
reading the &quot;Big Book&quot; <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here was a book that said that I could do something that all
these doctors and priests and ministers and psychiatrists that I'd
been going to for years couldn't do!<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 473.</font><br>
</blockquote>
</font>

<p>
<li>
And of course Allen would have us believe that all of the Groupers were constantly
receiving Guidance from God, Who was even telling them whether they should confess
something and to whom they should confess it. Rev. Geoffrey Allen's theology
was a radical departure from mainstream Christianity.

<p>
<li>
<a name="ftnt087_ret"> </a>
The mention of using laymen, rather than ordained clergy, to hear confessions
brings up another problem with the Oxford Groups. The Group members who hear
confessions are supposed to keep such confessions confidential,
but what about the people who leave the groups? How long will they remain
silent?<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt087" target="_blank">87</a></sup></font>
And what about the Group members who are less than <i>Absolutely Pure</i>, and
tend to be gossips and blabber-mouths?
The Oxford Groups had just that problem &#8212; gossips who could not keep secrets.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#confidential" target="_blank">More on that here</a>.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
And of course Alcoholics Anonymous has the same problem today. Anything you say in
an A.A. meeting
<a href="orange-letters14.html#blabbed" target="_blank">can become common knowledge all over town</a>

have a hey-day. And your &quot;sharing&quot; can even be
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#confessional" target="_blank">used against you in a court of law</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li> Rev. Jeffrey Allen simply assumed that everyone was burdened with feelings of guilt over things
that they had done in the past. That was one of the fundamental Buchmanite beliefs &#8212; that
everyone is separated from God by a long list of things that they haven't 
confessed. That is also
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq__you_wrong" target="_blank">

&#8212; it's all your fault. No matter what the situation is, you are to blame for it.

<p>
<a name="St_James"> </a>
Rev. John A. Richardson wrote a critical analysis of the Oxford Groups where
he stated:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It was customary in the early days of the Church to give literal obedience
to the injunction of St. James, &quot;Confess your faults to one another,&quot;
the only passage in the New Testament, I think, that can properly be
quoted in this connection.
<font color="blue">
We know, however, that the practice of public
confession, or, as the Groups would put it, confession in the fellowship,
was deliberately abandoned in the fifth century, because it became a cause
of moral mischief. The minds of the young were contaminated by the practice,
and the sensibilities of older persons needlessly offended.</font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is freely affirmed upon what seems to be unimpeachable evidence that the
revival of this ancient custom by Dr. Buchman has not been altogether
unaccompanied by moral evils similar to those that occasioned its abandonment.
Members of the Groups assure me that in their own experience they have
seen nothing of the sort, but I cannot help feeling that they have been
singularly fortunate in that regard; for there is not lacking evidence
that sometimes, at least, things have happened in this connection
to cause grave concern. Thus one, whom Dr. Hensley Henson [the Bishop of Durham]
certifies to be
&quot;a very thoughtful and devout Churchwoman, who was present at the
Oxford House Party,&quot; in 1933, I fancy, states that &quot;some of
the confessions were terrible. One in particular should never have been
made in public to an audience mixed in every sense of the word.&quot;
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within my own hearing, further, it was said by one prominent among
Canadian Church leaders that at a meeting of the Groups in
British Columbia &#8212; at Vancouver, if I am not mistaken &#8212; that he and
his wife were forced to leave the hall in protest against the character
of some of the sharings.<br>

<font color="blue">
As Rev. Richardson pointed out, the practice of public confessions in
the very early Christian church caused grave problems:
<ol>
<li> The minds of the children were contaminated by the practice. The children will hear
adults confessing what they have done, and the children will think that they might like to
try that too...
<li> Plus, the children will start to think that
<i>&quot;Everybody does it, so why shouldn't I? It's no big deal;
everybody does it.&quot;</i>
<li> The sensibilities of older persons were needlessly offended.
<li> People took pride in their sins.
(As in, <i>&quot;My sins and infidelities and binges were lots bigger
and longer and more outrageous than yours... Why, you're just a wimp
when compared to a big hardened old reprobate like me.&quot;</i>)
<li> And then people become desensitized to the sins confessed. Something
about which people talk every day, and admit every day, becomes commonplace
and loses its power to shock or shame. The unthinkable becomes thinkable.
</ol>
</font>
<p>
Rev. H.A. Ironside described Oxford Group confession sessions this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A group of them go off by invitation to some country inn, beautiful city hotel, or
country home. They boast that they are generally not after the down-and-outers
but the up-and-outers, people of wealth, people of fashion and culture, and they
gather together to spend several days in fellowship. Their meetings are largely
of this character: they come together as groups and devote a great deal of time
to testimony. These testimonies are generally in the nature of confessions.
They act on the scripture that says, &quot;Confess your faults one to another,&quot; and
stop there and do not notice the rest of the connection. They take it that the
way to get help is to come together and confess their faults one to the other.
Sometimes as a matter of decency women meet together and confess their sins to
each other, and men meet together and confess their sins to each other. When I
was in Boston, I found a good deal of scandal had been occasioned by mixed companies
holding these parties and confessing their sins, many of which were of such a character
that Scripture says, &quot;It is a shame even to speak of those things which are done
of them in secret&quot; (Eph. 5: 12). Yet they confessed these things openly, men
before women and women before men. You can understand that the result was
anything but helpful. Where do you find anything in the Word of God that suggests
this kind of confession of sin? They say when they come together and honestly
face their sins and tell about them, it gives them a certain spiritual strength
that enables them to turn from their sins and so enter upon a new and a changed
life.<br>

<a name="hilarity"> </a>
The tone of the confessions at Buchman's meetings was often anything but repentant.
Converts would tell grand entertaining tales of their &quot;extremely sinful ways&quot;
before being &quot;changed&quot; into a Buchmanite in a manner that bordered on
bragging. The confessional stories were often told in a jocular manner that
kept the audiences laughing. As Marjorie Harrison, a contemporary critic, said in her book,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When Dr. Buchman invited converts to stand up and confess at
one meeting that I attended, he said: &quot;Remember these three
points when you speak: BREVITY, SINCERITY, and HILARITY.&quot;
Members of his group are taught to be funny and jocular about
their sins. I should like to know how that can be reconciled
with the teaching of any religion.<br>

The Salvation Army has deliberately adopted a method that it
considers suitable and successful in attracting corner men
and women. The [Buchmanism] Group uses measures equally
undignified as a means of appeal to gilded youth.
In place of tambourines it has a slangy jargon:
instead of sanguinary hymns, modern catch-phrases:
its emotional appeal is subtle and insidious instead
of blatant. Above all, and in this it differs from
every other form of revivalism, the &quot;penitents' bench&quot;

Alcoholics Anonymous still has the same problem today. At speaker meetings,
the featured speaker will often entertain the audience and keep them laughing
by telling hilarious stories of his wild and crazy besotted adventures before
his conversion to sobriety. Later, when members of the audience &quot;share&quot;
their stories of alcoholic ruin,
they will confess their &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; and &quot;defects of
character&quot; with remorse and repentance. But the featured speaker
does a stand-up comedy routine that makes alcoholism and sin sound like

Marjorie Harrison attended many Oxford Group meetings, and noticed that
the confessions changed as members gained experience in making public confessions:
<p>
<blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
You will see an instance of how &quot;changing&quot; can be

are asked to testify.
These people are very touching in their complete sincerity,
humility and deep reverence.
Then hear the various members of the &quot;Teams&quot; &#8212; the
same type of people after they have had an intensive training
in Group methods and have recounted their sins at many public
confessions. There is no longer any ring of sincerity; they are
glib.
There is no humility; they are smug, complacent, and insufferably
priggish. And the reverence is gone completely.<br>

The practice &quot;emphasizes past occurrences unwholesomely,&quot;
says Dr. Douglas J. Wilson, Prof. in the University of Western Ontario,
to whose article in <i>The Christian Century</i> of August 23, 1933,
allusion has already been made, &quot;becomes artificial and partially
insincere, and
<font color="blue">
breeds a perilous spiritual pride</font>.&quot;
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;<br>
<font color="blue">
The spirit of pride is never likely to be far away from one who makes
repeated and habitual recital of sins before a public gathering</font>; and
herein, one cannot but think, lies a danger which even the leaders of
the Groups cannot wisely disregard. &quot;What you talk about without
embarrassment,&quot; says the Bishop of Durham wisely, &quot;you do
not feel deeply. The gravity of the wrong-doing dwindles as it is discussed&quot;
(<i>The Group Movement</i>, 2nd Ed., Part II, p. 55). &nbsp; ...<br>
<a name="routine"> </a>
The sincerity of those adherents of the Groups who spend weeks and months,
and in some cases, even years, in traveling from place to place
in the interests of the Movement will not be called in question.
No thoughtful person can doubt, however, that their repeated sharing
for witness before large public gatherings must strain that sincerity
severely.
A mechanical element enters into the telling of the same story over
and over again, and it becomes stale in its recital. Instead of a
spontaneous witness to victory won, it tends insensibly to become
a routine performance, and the sincerity of the confession diminishes.
&quot;It would be less than human,&quot; as it has been said,
&quot;if, in such circumstances, the story should not become exaggerated
and embroidered.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hilarity, moreover, has been almost exalted as a virtue by the Groups,
and, if the press reports of the meetings are to be believed, a
jocular element enters not seldom into the sharings, bringing with it
a danger of which many public speakers with a gift of humour are well
aware &#8212; the danger of making the real end of the story the laughter
that it provokes, instead of the truth that it is intended to tell.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A typical case in point was brought to my attention some little time
ago by one whose statement no one who knows him would dream of questioning.
In the course of her sharing at a large meeting in Montreal, a youthful
member of an international team sketched briefly the background of her
life. She was a clergyman's daughter, she said. On Sunday morning, of course,
they all went to church, and then came home to a good, hot dinner, during
which, &quot;while father carved the joint, mother always carved the
congregation.&quot; The flippant statement was rewarded with the applause
and laughter which it was obviously intended to provoke.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Not long after, the same team was operating in another city, where my
informant happened to be, and once more he attended a large gathering,
at which sharings were being given. The same lady gave the same sharing
in substantially the same words, and again her story found its climax
in the same pitiful joke at the expense of her mother, &quot;While father
carved the joint, mother always carved the congregation,&quot; and
once more her <i>mot</i> was rewarded with laughter and applause.
I do not suggest that such instances of bad taste are common.
The story shows sufficiently, however, one danger to which those who
are called upon to tell habitually the story of sins forgiven are
inevitably subject.<br>

One critic of the Oxford Groups noted how superficial the confessions
at the house parties really were.
People routinely confessed to having thought ill
of someone, or having been jealous, or having had a selfish urge,
or having worn make-up or drunk a cocktail or smoked a cigarette,
but rarely did anyone ever confess to having committed a real crime or to
anything serious (other than sex).
At one house party, when it came Frank Buchman's turn to confess something,
he admitted that he had cheated the Post Office out of small change
by putting insufficient postage on some letters. The whole group
then ceremonially trouped down to the Post Office where Buchman
&quot;made amends&quot; by paying the postage due.
Some of Frank Buchman's followers then marveled at what a wonderfully
honest and spiritual man Frank was, to have confessed to such
a trivial thing.

One of the peculiar features of Buchmanism was &quot;Guidance
sessions.&quot;
People would sit quietly with a notebook in hand, and listen for God's messages
during <i>&quot;The Quiet Hour&quot;</i>, and God would
speak to them, they believed.
Buchman liked to describe it as Group members receiving &quot;powerful
spiritual radiograms&quot;.
So the members of Buchman's groups
were forever claiming that God had guided them, and told them
to do this or that...

6. In the attitude of &quot;Speak Lord for Thy servant heareth&quot;

what he has to reveal to us concerning ourselves, what He wants us

7. You may find it real help to write down the ideas and
thoughts which the Holy Spirit has caused to arise in the mind.
The advantage of this is two-fold;  It is an aid to concentration

in checking at the close of the day thoughts received each

The London newspaper reporter Arthur James &quot;A. J.&quot; Russell,
who intended to write an expos&eacute; of Buchman, but
who was &quot;changed&quot; into a devoted Buchmanite and became the first Oxford Group archivist,
described his introduction to Frank Buchman's <i>Guidance</i> this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And then, of course, Frank suggested the inevitable Quiet Time.
Taking two sheets of notepaper, he handed one to me. We sat down
and listened in prayerful silence. I tried to pick up another
of those luminous thoughts. Nothing exceptional came: quit a lot
of ordinary human thoughts, but no luminous ones. I had no wish to
confess my sins to the person Frank had named, but I wished to see
the thing through as an honest test. Yet my thoughts in that Quiet Time
agreed with what Frank urged, though my wishes did not. I wrote
down my thoughts; then read them aloud to Frank, who confidently
and surprisingly pronounced them to be God-given thoughts.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh, come,&quot; I said to myself. &quot;That's much too strong
an interpretation.&quot; How on earth could a few wandering thoughts,
unattended by mystical feeling or luminosity, scribbled on a sheet
of notepaper, be catalogued as God's thoughts by anyone in his right
senses? Still, I was determined to see the thing through, being a
believer in the pragmatic method of learning by doing.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>For Sinners Only</i>, A. J. Russell, page 95.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In spite of his initial skepticism, Russell was soon converted into
a true believer who went on to write two whole books of praise for
Frank Buchman (<i>For Sinners Only</i> and <i>One Thing I Know</i>).
Eventually, A. J. Russell became the historian and chief publicist for
Frank Buchman's organization.

<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
Notice how Frank Buchman claimed that he had the ability to tell whether
a thought had come from God or not. We never got any explanation of just how,
when, or where Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman acquired that great magical power,
but Frank still felt entitled to routinely
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">censor or re-interpret other peoples' Guidance</a>,
because he allegedly saw God's will and
<a href="orange-rroot270.html#Gods_mind" target="_blank">knew God's mind</a>
far more clearly than they could.
</i></font>

<p>
<a name="automatic_writing"> </a>

Rev. Geoffrey Allen, a minister at Oxford University who became a true believer
and a leader in Buchman's cult, described Guidance this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is a custom to be recommended, that those who seek to receive instruction
from God in quiet should take pencil and paper, and write down the thoughts
to which His Spirit leads. If any feel superior to the use of such material
aids, they may well question whether God also is convinced that they do
not need them. The custom of writing slows the rapid pace of wandering
thoughts, that the voice of the Spirit may be heard; it enables us the
more surely to remember His lessons, and to see that His requests are
performed.<br>
</font>

<i>He That Cometh; A Sequel to 'Tell John,' being further essays on
the Message of Jesus and Present Day Religion</i>, Geoffrey Allen, pages 99-100.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That sounds very similar to the common occult practice called
<i>Automatic Writing</i>, which is another favorite trick,
like the Ouija board, of would-be psychics.
What you do is, you just relax and let your hand write anything
that comes into your mind. Then you imagine that you are
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">channelling</a>&quot;
someone else's thoughts &#8212; usually the thoughts of a dead person, ghost, or spirit.
Well, Buchmanites went so far as to imagine that they were channelling God.

B. W. Smith, who investigated the Oxford Group in 1936, described
Frank Buchman's &quot;guided&quot; behavior as:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Always, he says, he follows his &quot;guidance.&quot; Sometimes he
is guided as to how much to spend for postage. Once, in Canada, when
they quoted him a rate of $12 a day for rooms, he said that God had
told him to pay only $3.50. Once, just at the beginning of an important
Group meeting in Aberdeen, Scotland, he suddenly said that he had
been &quot;guided&quot; to take a ship to South America. It turned
out that the ship he was guided to go and return on also carried
the Prince of Wales. It is not recorded what progress Dr. Buchman
made with the Prince, but I believe he &quot;changed&quot; the
ship's doctor.<br>

<p>
Frank Buchman would walk into a room full of followers and brightly announce,
&quot;I knew someone here needed me. I received <i>Guidance</i> to
come.&quot; That kind of ego game is easy to play; in any group of
a dozen or more people, it is easy to find someone who was supposedly
in need of a few words of divine wisdom.

In Briarcliff Manor, not far from Nyack where lives Oom the Omnipotent, onetime &quot;love cultist,&quot; The Groups had an international house party. Glib, bright-eyed Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman, &quot;soul surgeon,&quot; arrived on the S. S. Aquitania with a party of 22 &quot;experienced&quot; members of The Groups, many of whom had met with him at a house party in Geneva last January (TIME, Jan. 18).

<p>
The Press gave much notice to their doings. Soul Surgeon Buchman, who looks to the camera much like his good friend John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s cousin Percy (see p. 55), handed out envelopes full of clippings from British newspapers, said he appreciated the publicity he had gotten from &quot;the Bishops&quot; and the Press in England. He explained that &quot;this is a peripatetic group, just as the disciples of Jesus. It goes wherever God guides it.&quot; He smiled amiably, as did his entourage, 17 of whom had prepared typewritten statements for the reporters, describing themselves and the manner of their conversions to The Groups. Typical was the account of Jonkheer Eric van Lennep, Knight of St. John of Holland, who said of himself: &quot;He used to live behind masks; a mask for the office; a mask for his friends, a mask at home and another for his social activities; but he has found freedom from all that, and more, in a God-guided and unified life. And having found a good thing, who would not pass it on to his friends?&quot;

<p>
Proprietor Chauncey Depew Steele of Briarcliff Lodge is sympathetic to The Groups. Two years ago all the bellhops, chambermaids, desk clerks attended a Group meeting. Last week the 425 members of the house party, each paying $4 per day during the ten-day stay, had the place much to themselves. They met first at a dinner, with much grinning and chuckling and calling of first names. Then Rev. Samuel Moor (&quot;Sam&quot;) Shoemaker Jr. opened the first &quot;experience meeting&quot; with the story about the unemployed broker who hired out to a zoo to pose in a lion's skin, was scared by another lion who turned out to be another unemployed broker. The Groups laughed. &quot;That's right, Sam!&quot; cried Founder Buchman. &quot;That's the way we're meeting unexpected friends here tonight.&quot; Then the meeting grew chummy, with much talk of &quot;sharing&quot; (mutual confession), &quot;surrender&quot; (conversion) and spiritual fellowship. There were preachers, athletes, college professors, brokers, an elderly gentleman described as a retired 'legger, socialites from Manhattan, Louisville, Holland, South Africa, England &#8212; all pleasant, engaging folk, none of them shabby or pasty or odd-looking.

<p>
Next day, first thing after breakfast, came &quot;quiet time.&quot; Reporters watched The Group members assemble in the sunny ballroom, get out pencil &amp; paper &quot;to take down what God says.&quot; Some waited with poised pencils, others took down copious messages. After 15 minutes D. Scoville Wishard said: &quot;Some will want to share what God said.&quot; There were many who did, all beginning &quot;it came to me. . . .&quot; Said Jonkheer van Lennep: &quot;God has told me he is blessing this house party.&quot; Said Evershed Thompson of the Edinburgh Stock Exchange: &quot;Jesus is here.&quot;<br>

<a href="orange-rroot390.html#Vic_Kitchen_photo1b">Vic Kitchen</a>,
another long-time true believer in the Oxford Group, wrote
a book where he listed some of the benefits of living a surrendered and &quot;Guided&quot; life:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
... Even with no change in the curriculum or staff, a surrendered and God-conscious
student can gain much more from the present modes of education than any of his
pagan friends.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is first of all the matter of choosing schools and of finding the means
to go there. I have seen youngsters in the Oxford Group,  for instance, select
their schools or colleges, not according to parental preference, not according to
ideas of their own, but according to the direct and often amazing guidance of God.
This guidance sometimes leads to most unexpected institutions that neither the
student nor parent had considered. At other times God shows the opportunity for
attending leading universities that the student had considered beyond hope.
In one case, due to depression, a young man had given up all idea of going to
college. Then God told him that he <i>ought</i> to go &#8212; told him <i>where</i> to
go &#8212; and told him where to <i>find the money</i>. This is not an unusual
occurrence. It is only one case in many.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once <i>in</i> his school or college, moreover, the guided student finds the right
selection of studies and he finds a greater ability to study &#8212; a certain sharpening
of the mind such as I have tried to describe in my own experience. He finds himself
able to attack the most intricate studies and to master subjects that have always
been a bugbear. He finds, moreover, that God does not let his studies suffer when,
as sometimes happens, He diverts him temporarily to other details of His work.<br>

There is little friction between my wife and myself because, when we see a difference

Peter Howard wrote:

Some people in the Group have received the most remarkable and dramatic
pieces of guidance from God. I have heard a naval officer describe, with
obvious sincerity, how in the middle of a naval action he received precise
guidance from God which told him which decisions to take and which helped
him and his ship through.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Others record how they suddenly received guidance to go to a certain
street and there met people who needed their help. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When the air raids began, I was frightened, but foolhardy. Thus,
although I felt alarmed, I goaded myself to stand out in Ludgate Circus
and watch the bombardment when the first mass daylight raid on
the London docks came our way.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Soon after promising Garth Lean to listen to God, I received a message
that if I trusted myself to God there was no need to fear. But that
to go about in the streets unnecessarily when a raid was on was wrong.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Explain it as you like, I have not from that moment felt over-alarmed
in air raids.<br>

Peter Howard was obviously just

a few choice stories there, and attempting a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof By Anecdote</a>.
Howard said nothing about the many thousands of other naval officers
who got killed. Didn't they pray too?
Didn't God like their prayers?
What happened to their 'Guidance'?
Why did God choose to help just one begging believer and let all of the others die?

<p>
And the fact that Peter Howard managed to overcome his fear of air raids
proves nothing. It's irrelevant. It says nothing about Oxford Groupers
receiving <i>Guidance</i> from God.
(It's the propaganda trick of

The voice that told him that it was wrong to &quot;go about in the streets

In the Spring of 1942 Wing Commander Edward Howell began to recover from wounds he sustained
in the Battle of Crete, May 1941. While commanding a Hurricane Fighter Squadron he
was shot down, and was seriously wounded in ground fighting. He was left for dead.
Eventually, picked up by German paratroopers, he was flown to prison-camp hospitals
in Greece, where he had an experience which changed the course of his life. In his book
&quot;Escape to Live&quot; he tells an amazing story.<br>

&quot;Having long been an atheist, I decided to stop trying to run my life and to let God,
if he was there, tell me what to do. The result was immediate and fascinating. I found
myself able to communicate with Him and receive constant instruction.
Still in very poor health, I was half my normal weight and had both arms crippled
with open wounds, so that everything had to be done for me by others. I had lost most
of what we normally value, yet I suddenly found myself happier than I had ever been, and
that I cared about the people around me with an inner peace and purpose I had never known
before. I had escaped from self-concern and self-interest into a new way of living.
I had escaped to live.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Then God showed me how to escape from prison. In my condition it seemed quite impossible
but I chose to trust and obey Him and miracles resulted. There was no one about where there
should have been; a locked door had been left unlocked; a sentry had his mind somewhere else.
I managed to scale a high wall without using my helpless arms and fell, literally, on my
feet instead of my head. A star became my guide. My wounds healed overnight. Shepherds
and villagers in the Greek mountains became my friends and helpers despite language
barriers. Finally, a smuggler's boat took me by night from Mount Athos, the Holy Mountain,
to safety in Turkey and so back home again.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Home was the end of that journey and the beginning of many others, also fascinating
and rewarding. I took part in the planning for D Day and was also on the Air Staff at the
Pentagon in Washington. Since the war I have worked with MRA in many countries, and have
also been in business in the United States and Greece.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The worst experience of my life had been transformed into the best. I became aware
of the immense network of God's people, those who respond to Him, giving the continuing
hope and promise of a new world. The star had led me into wholly new ways &#8212; and still does.&quot;<br>

The one really big, important dangling loose end that both
Edward Howell and Peter Howard failed to
explain in their stories is how and why &quot;God&quot; neglected to give such
life-saving Guidance to about 30 or 40 million other good people in that war.
Why didn't God bother to give such help to the Germans who opposed Hitler,
or to the Russians, or even to the Jews
in Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Dachau, and Treblinka? Didn't God love them?
Didn't they pray enough?

rate God's Guidance and help?
<p>
(And what about the German Oxford Group members who prayed for help
while fighting against the British soldiers?
If God helped them, wouldn't that be God helping to kill British
Oxford Group members?)

<p>
I am reminded of the words of one of the ministers who criticized
Frank Buchman's heretical teachings &#8212; He said that he considered it blasphemy for
Frank Buchman to speak about how God was helping Frank Buchman, and doing great things for
Frank Buchman, while the rest of humanity was dying. I have to agree.

The Buchmanites believed in a God who micro-manages the world.
According to Buchmanism, God has a grand plan for everything, right
down to the germs.
Everything that happens is caused by God. There are no coincidences
or accidents, they say.
This quote from the &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
is typical of Buchmanite beliefs:<br>
<a name="no_mistakes"> </a>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And acceptance is the answer to <i>all</i> my problems today.
When I am disturbed, it is because I find some person, place, thing,

According to Buchmanism, everything is subject to the will of God.
God is concerned with even the tiniest of details in this world.
God even cares whether you choose to drink coffee, tea, Coke, Pepsi, or
water with lunch today.
A follower who has properly
<i>&quot;Surrendered to Guidance&quot;</i>, and who lives a life that is
<i>&quot;under God-control&quot;</i>, will intuitively make
the choice that pleases God. And God, in turn, will make things turn out
right for those followers who please Him. To hear the Buchmanites
tell it, God is constantly kept busy pulling millions of puppet
strings, to make things happen just the way He wants them to.

This is an eye-witness account of one of the Oxford Group's Quiet Times,
given by a former member of the Group:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The team is sitting in a semi-circle around Sam [Shoemaker?].
&quot;Well,&quot; Sam asks, &quot;what's the plan for to-nights meeting?
Let's listen.&quot;...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Guidance-books&quot; appear, pencils fly swiftly over blank
sheets.
Some peer glassily at the ceiling. Others close their eyes momentarily,
and are invariably rewarded with two or three lines of guidance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Amen. What comes?&quot;, Sam asks, as the scrape of pencils
and pens perceptibly diminishes in volume, thereby indicating to
him that the details of God's plan have been fully communicated.
Sharing begins. &quot;Any guidance about the motif?&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;It comes to me that J. ought to give a good wad on Sin.
My guidance is that we shall get the pious crowd to-night,&quot;
says B.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;That checks with my guidance,&quot; says another.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Check,&quot; &quot;check,&quot; &quot;check,&quot;
echoes from many of the team.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;That's it, Sin &#8212; that's what
I got too. Sin is the drive for to-night.&quot;
(It should be noted that guidance is regarded as being practically
infallible when a majority is in agreement.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The door opens. Frank [Buchman] walks in, and sits next to Sam.
&quot;How far have you got with to-night's meeting?&quot;, he asks.<br>

<a name="pagan_bunch"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;It seems clear that sin is the motif to-night,&quot; Sam tells him.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Frank interrupts quickly: &quot;Now wait a minute. I'm not so sure.
I've got a feeling that it may be too early for sin. 'Intrigue'
is what came to me in my early quiet time.
You've got to get hold of that important pagan bunch.
Play with 'em &#8212; show 'em what they're missing. Give 'em the
feeling that religion's more fun than cocktail parties.
Suppose we have further Quiet, and check up on it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
More Quiet. More writing. Frank was always a tonic. Every one writes
more busily. Guidance comes more easily. The words
&quot;intrigue&quot; and &quot;hilarity&quot; appear on many notebooks.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Amen, what comes!&quot;, asks Frank.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I got 'intrigue' this time,&quot; says B.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sam seemed to have got different guidance too this time.
(The phrases &quot;right guidance&quot; and &quot;bad guidance&quot; were in
common use.)
&quot;I check with you, Frank,&quot; he says. &quot;It came to me that I
must be more flexible, and have no preconceptions.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Check,&quot; &quot;check,&quot; &quot;check,&quot; again echoes
round the room.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Frank resumes. &quot;Well now, I'll share my guidance &#8212; A battery
of witness from young Oxford. They want to hear Oxford,
so we'll let 'em. Crisp nuggets of witness. Intrigue the young
pagan elements. Sweep 'em along. That's my guidance.
Now I don't want to dictate. I may be wrong. I want you to
check me.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But we knew better. Frank's guidance was always right</a>.<br>

<p>
The group had ostensibly clearly heard God's Will during
their first &quot;Quiet Time&quot;, and such Guidance was supposed to be
nearly infallible,
but when Frank Buchman came in and contradicted them, the whole group
changed its opinion of &quot;God's Will&quot; in two minutes flat.
So much for getting infallible guidance from God during one's Quiet Time.
<p>
Also notice how Buchman called those who had
not joined his group &quot;pagans&quot;.
That is common cultish behavior &#8212; name-calling,
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_enemy" target="_blank">devaluing the outsider</a>, and
encouraging an us-versus-them mindset.
So is the attitude that
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">the leader is always right</a>.

<p>
<a name="guidance_criticisms"> </a>
Geoffrey Williamson, a journalist who investigated the Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament,
said of such &quot;received Guidance&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
It is idle to speculate whether these promptings emanate from a living God,
from the depths of the subconscious, from an individual's own conscience,
from a latent &quot;better self&quot;, or from a form of wishful thinking.<br>

<a name="closely_in_touch"> </a>
And Marjorie Harrison, another contemporary investigator, stated:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As <i>The Times</i> [of London] put it in a leading article,
&quot;It would be incredible if the bulk of the 'guidance'
received in 'quiet times' would not consist of submerged thoughts
and desires. Most of what is put forward as guidance received in
these periods of relaxed attention is so trivial that it would
be impious to ascribe it to the promptings of God.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Group itself does not deny this. Dr. Buchman himself admits
that &quot;thoughts might come from the sub-conscious self or from
the evil one&quot;.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The author of
<a href="What_Is_The_Oxford_Group.pdf" target="_blank"><i>What is the Oxford Group?</i></a>
says:
&quot;The human mind ... takes up a train of thought it finds
hard to discard, invents or remembers a thought of its own.
But to those closely in touch with God, it becomes easy after
a short while to differentiate between spiritual and human
messages.&quot;
Was there ever a more thoughtless, dangerous and careless
pronouncement on a subject of gravest importance to the lives
of so many people?<br>

And, I would add, &quot;Such arrogance, such conceit.&quot;
That Buchmanite just assumed that he was <i>&quot;closely in
touch with God&quot;</i>
because he had practiced Buchmanism for &quot;a short while&quot;.
<i>For a short while?</i>
In the history of the world's great religions, we often find stories
of saints who spent most of their lives in prayer and meditation &#8212;
just to finally get a mere few paragraphs of enlightened wisdom &#8212; and those
saints felt that it was worth the wait.

that many of them leave out the light of reason (also a lamp given
us for our Guidance) and what might be called sanctified common-sense.<br>

The Bishop later explained:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...I would say now that of course we Christians rely on Guidance.
'As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the Sons of God.' We take one day at
a time, and we trust the Holy Spirit to see us through, and so He does. That has been my
slogan for years. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Yet frankly I have seen dangers and foresee dangers. For instance, in the matter of Guidance,
we must remember that the Lamp of Reason was given us by God to guide us. Therefore,
we must do nothing against reason. This will save us from mistaking a mere whim or
desire as Guidance by the Holy Spirit.
I illustrated that point when giving a farewell charge to thirty-three Groupers who left
England in 1932, as a team to visit Canada and the United States. I told them of a very
unhappy story of misguidance, which I knew to be true, for it was given to me by the father
of the girl who was the victim of it. Because of the behaviour of a young man in the Group
towards my informant's daughter, the father was completely put off by the movement.
His attitude was understandable, if not quite logical.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;<i>The young man had written a love-letter to his daughter on the Friday, but
on the Monday he had been 'guided' to propose to another girl.</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'The father said he wanted a horse-whipping, for his sense of decency should have come in
to check such ungentlemanly conduct. The Group should insist upon such safeguards as the
Lamp of Reason, and the observance of good taste and decency when interpreting Guidance.
When I told my story at the Group meeting, it raised a laugh; but it is a serious
objection, none the less, for the story is true.&quot;<br>

(That was also a subtle form of resistance to criticism &#8212; just laugh

The Group by its interpretation of Divine Guidance advocates the
dowsing of these lamps.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To return to the simile of a father and his children. The Group
teaches the child to regard his father not as a guide and
defence generally and a ready help in time of trouble, but
someone to whom the child turns for actual direction in everything
he does. Father, shall I play with my train or my bricks?
Father, shall I build a house or a bridge?
Father, shall I use red bricks or blue?
Father, shall I knock it down?
Father, shall I build it up?
Father this and father that, until a father might well wonder
whether his child is a half-wit, instead of a reasonable being.<br>

Why should we storm the courts of Heaven to know whether we shall
buy cigarettes or take the 10.45 or the 11 o'clock train to town,

neckties or whether we choose to eat beef or mutton at luncheon.&quot;<br>

Marjorie Harrison interviewed Frank Buchman, and asked him about &quot;Guidance&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I asked him to justify &quot;Guidance&quot; as he teaches it.
He asked me if I had read the Book of Ezekiel lately.
I replied that I had not. But I have since done so: I fail
to see the slightest connection between the vision of Ezekiel, prophet
and priest, a man set apart by God and chosen by Him, not when
Ezekiel desired it but when God willed &#8212; to be the recipient of
direct Divine Guidance, and the little circular clumps of converts,
heads together, notebooks in hand, seated in the lounge of a
fashionable hotel. Their heads are bent; eyes screwed up.
Then in a moment or two they start scribbling in the little books.
They read out the result in turn. They laugh and chatter and
seem to enjoy themselves hugely. They appear to be playing
&quot;consequences&quot;, they believe they are having an
audience with God.
No, Dr. Buchman, there does not appear to be any connection
between this and the burning vision of Ezekiel &quot;among
the captives by the river Chebar&quot; when the heavens
opened and he saw &quot;visions of God&quot;.<br>

When people seriously believe that their own random thoughts and

convinced of anything they wish.
This can lead to just about any kind of insane behavior you

receiving Guidance while practicing A.A. Step Eleven:

What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration becomes a working
part of the mind.
Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact
with God, it is not probable
that we are going to be inspired at all times.
<font color="#9F0000">We might pay for this presumption in all sorts

And many Oxford Group members did behave irrationally as a result of
their &quot;Guidance&quot;. There were numerous stories of students getting
&quot;Guidance&quot; to neglect or abandon their studies and skip their final exams,
to abandon their careers and just devote their entire lives to the Oxford Group:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

The Group boasts of the reunion of parents and children thanks
to its influence. It does not count the homes sundered through
the same cause. Parents, who have made sacrifices to send their
sons and daughters to the University, are exasperated and distressed
to find time wasted, work neglected and careers ruined. I was
told recently of a man who, at considerable financial inconvenience,
had undertaken the education of a young nephew. In the midst of
his University career the boy insisted on throwing up his work
and attaching himself to the Buchmanites. No sense or reason
can be used as an influence. To every argument they blandly
reply that they know that they are right because God told them so.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here is another instance of the shallowness of thought and extremes
of teaching of which the Group must be held guilty.
In a booklet issued by the Group entitled <i>The Guidance of God</i>,
there is a story of a three-year-old child taught to be quiet and
listen to God's Voice. He looks up and remarks: &quot;God says
that you must eat more porridge this morning.&quot; Although
the child is obviously reiterating an injunction of his mother's,
this is put forward as a direct instance of Divine Guidance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the same booklet there is the dangerous injunction: &quot;Look
for the coincidences&quot; as sign-posts of Guidance.<br>
...<br>
<a name="authority"> </a>
... If <i>every</i> passing thought is to be followed as Guidance,
and <i>every</i> coincidence regarded as a Divine intervention,
where are we to stop this side madness?
<font color="blue">
Dr. Buchman has no authority whatever for his doctrine
of direct guidance available at any moment.<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The result of such a teaching, made &quot;with an infallibility the
Pope would envy&quot;, is to rob men and women of their God-given
intelligence, and to weaken their sense of reason and their capacity
for judgement until they become almost non-existent. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
It is a pitiable fact that many young children are now being brought
up this way. I believe that there are no words too strong to
condemn such a teaching, and that its consequences can be so terrible
that no warning is too grave.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The &quot;Quiet Time&quot; encourages introspection: the pseudo-guidance
is its result. Minds deranged, homes made tragic, careers broken, bitter
disappointment following the unhappy or negative outcome of this
so-called guidance &#8212; these are the consequences.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I would sum up in the words of <i>The [London] Times</i>:
<font color="blue">
&quot;It must be the most serious charge against the Groups that they
encourage their members to shirk the discipline of thought in
favour of impulses received from they know not where.&quot;<br>

The teaching on Guidance is as great a superstition as any purged
from the Church at the Reformation.<br>

Rev. John A. Richardson also wrote about <i>'Guidance'</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A young man writes a love-letter to one girl on Friday, and is &quot;guided&quot;
to propose to another girl on the following Monday. (Related to Mr.
Reginald Lennard, Fellow and Tutor of Wadham College, Oxford, as authenticated
by the Bishop of London, &quot;Morals and the Group Movement,&quot;
<i>The Nineteenth Century and After</i>, Nov., 1933, pp. 600-601.)
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No less a person than Canon Grensted says, &quot;I was once worrying as to
which I should do: go a long journey by car or by train. After a long time
wasted in weighing the pros and cons, guidance came suddenly through
with the message: 'Don't be a fool, go by car.'&quot;
(<i>For Sinners Only</i>, A. J. Russell, Eng. Ed., Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Ltd.,
p. 288).
It is hardly in such language that we may expect the Holy Spirit to speak
to us, but we may let that point pass.
The significant thing about Prof. Grensted's testimony is that he regards
it as wasted time to consider for a few moments the advantages and disadvantages
of two contrasted courses of action in the experiences of ordinary life.
He would have us believe, it seems, that the exercise of common sense by
a Christian is superseded by dependence upon supernatural intimations.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... Prof. Douglas J. Wilson [Prof. in the University of Western Ontario]
... informs us that within his own experience
<font color="blue">
&quot;Group leaders were 'guided' to break important engagements
</font>
while
large gatherings of people sat waiting in confused ignorance&quot;
(&quot;A Critique of Buchmanism,&quot; <i>The Christian Century</i>,
August 23, 1933).
I have it on excellent authority, moreover, that similar breaches of
courtesy and common sense were observed in Toronto during one of the
great gatherings of the Movement.
<font color="blue">
Sunday pulpit engagements are said
to have been actually broken without a word of warning even at the last
moment, leaving embarrassed ministers to improvise a sermon. Called to account
later on for their inconsiderate behavior, the defaulting persons are
said to have replied with apparent unconcern that they had been
&quot;guided&quot; to go elsewhere. &nbsp; ...<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
With such incidents in view, few rationally-minded persons are likely
to disagree with the Bishop of Durham, when he says with his customary
directness that such a conception of guidance cannot be reconciled &quot;either
with piety or with good sense. It appears to be equally inconsistent
with the character of God and the self-respect of man&quot;
(<i>The Group Movement</i>, 2nd Ed., Part II, p. 66).

<a name="blindfolded"> </a>
Nor will they find it difficult to make their own conclusion arrived at
in the matter by Mr. Reginald Lennard.
&quot;The practical dangers of 'guidance,' however,&quot; he affirms,
&quot;great as they are, do not seem to me to be the most serious objection
which can be urged against it on ethical grounds. It is all-important
to notice the fundamental implications of the doctrine &#8212; its ethical
implications, I mean;...
Guidance is only to be sought in those matters which are usually matters
for reason and common sense or for principles and conscience.
<font color="blue">
No suggestion is ever made that we should substitute 'guidance' for our
eyesight and walk across a busy street under 'guidance' with our eyes
blindfolded.
<i>In other words, that in man which he shares with other
animals is honored and trusted to do its work.</i>
<i>The reason, which most obviously distinguishes him from other animals,
is dethroned.</i>
</font>
(The italics are my own. [&#8212;Richardson])
<font color="#9F0000">
It is difficult to conceive anything more degrading.</font>
The theory and practice of 'guidance' is not merely foolish and likely to lead
in practice to moral pitfalls. It is in itself fundamentally immoral....
Imagine a world in which everyone lived wholly by 'guidance,'
making each day simply the execution of commands received in the morning
'Quiet Time' and noted in the guidance book! All planning and thought,
everything permanent in human relationships and human purposes,
everything which makes life really human and worth living, would be
brushed aside as an irrelevant waste of time if this theory were worked
out to its logical conclusion and acted upon to the full&quot;
(&quot;Morals and the Group Movement,&quot; <i>The Nineteenth Century and
After</i>, Nov., 1933, p. 602).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I leave the subject by merely recording the opinion of the Rev. E. R.
Micklem, of Mansfield College, Oxford, one of the contributors to
<i>Oxford and the Groups</i>. &quot;To look for daily intimations,&quot;
he says, &quot;&#8212; subtle promptings &#8212; which indicate the tasks God
has in mind for us, rather than to look for illumination on the way
of grasping the multifarious and obvious opportunities of service which
our ordinary daily life presents, is to attempt to live in a world
of mechanical responses rather than of personal relationships&quot; (p. 144).<br>

Rev. Richardson made a couple of great points there. Nobody walked across
a busy highway while wearing a blindfold, trusting Guidance to safely
guide his feet. The reason that they didn't is because, deep down in their hearts,
they knew that Guidance didn't really work.
<p>
And Rev. Richardson was quite correct when he called the practice of 'Guidance'
degrading.
It would reduce humanity to being just so many remote-controlled toys of God.
Children like to play with radio-controlled toy cars or airplanes, but
Frank Buchman would have us believe that God prefers radio-controlled
hairless monkees that mindlessly, unquestioningly, obey the orders that they receive
through &quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#radiograms" target="_blank">spiritual radiograms</a>&quot;.

Back in the 1920s, Dr. Frank Buchman was originally warmly received at
Cambridge University by the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union

Dr. Oliver Barclay, a former CICCU president, wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>

Buchman was at first received warmly by CICCU.... As time went on, however,
disturbing features emerged. He spoke of the Quiet Time, but it was less and less
a time of Bible study and prayer and increasingly a time of &quot;listening to God.&quot;
This members did with their minds blank and with pencil and paper in hand,
writing down the thoughts that came to them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In this way men received entirely irrational guidance.... regarded as authoritative....

Rev. Geoffrey Allen of Oxford University, who became a true believer
and a leader in Buchman's cult, even taught followers to be ready to
break appointments whenever they received Guidance to do so:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
As we surrender our prejudices to God, so also we must surrender our engagements,
so that we allow Him to direct in perfect freedom how He would have us spend
our day. We shall not start our time of quiet before Him, blocking in the
day that lies ahead with all that we have planned to do, and then asking Him
how He would have us spend what is left of our time.
God is Lord of the whole of our time.
If He wills that we should go to apparently fixed engagements, He will send us
to them.
<font color="blue">
If He wills that we should break free from them to be used for other
work of His, He is able to guide us how without damage to others of His
children we may be set free.
</font>
Of course, under His guidance, we may be at liberty to fill our diaries with
engagements for days and weeks and months ahead. We must, however, then each
new day allow God to redirect us as His purposes demand.
It is men and not God who are fickle; but where men in revolt live their days
by their own changing, selfish wills, God must be also free to adjust His
plans to their changing situations, so as best to use those who obey Him,
for calling the world back to His service.<br>

Dr. H. H. Henson, the Bishop of Durham, strongly disagreed with Rev. Allen

I have read this passage several times, and considered it carefully, but I
have not been able to reconcile it either with piety or with good sense.
It appears to be equally inconsistent with the character of God and the
self-respect of man. If generally acted upon, it would make social life
almost impossible. It suggests that the Almighty may first 'guide' His
children to frame engagements, which, when they fall due, He may 'guide'
them to break. Instead of directing his course by reason and conscience,
illumined no doubt by the Spirit of God, but indestructably free and
responsible, the Christian is reduced to dependence on specific directions
which he cannot foresee, may not understand or approve, and must not
disobey.<br>

Curiously, few of the Oxford Group believers ever got any &quot;Guidance&quot; that
conflicted with any of Frank Buchman's &quot;Guidance&quot;.
You would think that some conflicts
or collisions would be inevitable, because anybody could think, or imagine that
he heard, anything
he wanted to, but apparently, &quot;God&quot; managed to keep His followers from
making any mistakes. How convenient.
<p>
Actually, Buchman implemented a system of checks for the regular followers:
they had to submit their received Guidances to the other group members,
or, preferably, the  group elders, for approval.
That was called <i>&quot;Checking Guidance&quot;</i>.
The other members or elders would interpret and approve of the Guidance,
or not approve of it. If it conflicted with the guidance handed down
from Frank Buchman and his lieutenants, then such erroneous Guidance
must have come from <i><b>The Evil One</b></i>, not God.
In that way, no follower could get a message from God like,
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;Frank Buchman is crazy. Quit this stupid cult right now.&quot;</i></font>

Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham, pointed out that Buchman's
doctrine of <i>Checking Guidance</i> created a great contradiction:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the Groupist system, although the individual is encouraged to attach
Divine authority to the 'luminous thoughts' which visit the mind during the
'Quiet Time', and may be written down in his 'Guidance Book', and although
he is urged to govern his daily course, even in the pettiest details and
in spite of the dislocation of carefully-prearranged engagements which may
be entailed by his obedience to their direction, external authority is not
lacking. Above the Groupist there is the Group to which he is attached, and
beyond the Group there is an 'Inner Group' over which Dr. Buchman himself
presides, and whose decisions are final. Groupism is thus a closed system,
as close-knit and dominating as that of the Jesuits, which leaves to the
individual Groupist little liberty and no ultimate responsibility.
In a recently published letter, expressed with gravity and restraint,
twelve Evangelical clergymen resident in Oxford have instanced this aspect
of the Movement as one of the objections which may be fairly urged against
it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Helvetica,Swiss,SansSerif,Courier">
'They [sc. the Groups] insist that individual guidance must be &quot;checked&quot;
(i.e. tested and approved) by the collective guidance of the Group, with
ultimate reference to the &quot;Inner Group&quot; of which Dr. Buchman is the head.
Loyalty to the Group &#8212; as being directly controlled by the Holy Spirit &#8212;
is the dominating factor in determining the actions and choices of its
members.'

A religious movement which begins
by ignoring all existing systems, and claims to have none of its own,
ends by becoming a system more despotic than any!
</font>
In order to 'check'
the marching orders from on high which the Groupist has been taught to
count upon, and which in fact he claims to have received, the movement
has found itself forced to create a 'checking' machinery which robs the
Groupist of his private judgement, and binds him to an unquestioning
obedience to the verdicts of another authority than that of the 'luminous
thought' which he was originally required to look on as Divine!<br>

Indeed. It would seem that Frank Buchman got to over-ride &quot;the Word of God&quot;
whenever he felt like it. No matter what &quot;God&quot; seemed to have said
to a Group member during his <i>Quiet Time</i>,
it was Frank Buchman and his lieutenants who got to decide what God really said.

Bill Wilson implemented the same &quot;checking of Guidance&quot;

The benefit of talking to another person is that we can get
his direct comment and counsel on our situation, and there can
be no doubt in our minds what that advice is.
<font color="blue">
Going it alone in spiritual matters is dangerous.
</font>
How many times have we heard well-intentioned people claim the
guidance of God when it was all too plain that they were sorely
mistaken. Lacking both practice and humility, they had deluded
themselves and were able to justify the most arrant 
nonsense on the ground that this was what God had told them.
It is worth noting that people of very high spiritual development
almost
<font color="blue">
always insist on checking with friends or spiritual advisors
the guidance they feel they have received from God.
Surely then, a novice ought not lay himself open to the chance
of making foolish, perhaps tragic, blunders in this fashion.
</font>
While the comment or advice of others may be by no means infallible,
it is likely to be far more specific than any direct guidance
we may receive

while we are still so inexperienced in establishing
contact with a Power greater than ourselves</font>.<br>

So, Bill says, you shouldn't trust your own mind &#8212; you shouldn't
trust yourself to correctly receive <i>Guidance</i> directly from God while
practicing A.A. Step Eleven. You should let your sponsor and the
other group old-timers interpret your guidance, and tell you
what God really said, and what God really wants you to do.
So they, not God, become your real bosses. It is their voices that

It was obvious to contemporary theologians that Frank Buchman went off on an occult tangent
in developing his theology.
Buchman and his followers were allegedly
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank"><i>channelling</i> God</a> while
<i>receiving Guidance</i>,
not much different, really, from some spiritist or medium who claims to be
channelling the spirits of dead people.
There were even stories of Buchmanites getting together for
<i>Quiet Time &quot;spook sessions&quot;</i>,
where they attempted to contact spirits other than God.
In his historical novel <i>Wide is the Gate</i> (1943),
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Sinclair_2" target="_blank">Upton Sinclair described</a>
Oxford Groupers holding s&eacute;ances in London
with a self-proclaimed medium who claimed to channel the spirits of the
Indian chief Tecumseh and a long-dead Ceylonese Buddhist monk.

<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult2" target="_blank">Bill Wilson also pretended to be
a medium</a>, and, while he was the leader of Alcoholics Anonymous,
he routinely conducted s&eacute;ances where he
claimed that he was channeling a long-dead Catholic priest named
&quot;Boniface&quot;, along with numerous other entities whom Bill
said were both good and evil spirits:

In fact, A. J. Russell's third book was nothing but two Buchmanite women claiming to
be channelling Jesus Christ. After Frank Buchman &quot;changed&quot; him,
the London newspaper reporter Arthur James Russell
wrote <i>&quot;For Sinners Only&quot;</i> (1932),
a book of praise of Frank Buchman that became
the standard textbook for the Oxford Groups.

Then <i>&quot;One Thing I Know&quot;</i> (1933)
was more praise of Frank Buchman, his organization, and his religious doctrines.
But Russell's third book, <i>&quot;God Calling&quot;</i>, was a very different
piece of work. Two of Frank Buchman's women followers read Russell's book
<i>&quot;For Sinners Only&quot;</i>, and then allegedly began
to receive very specific messages from Jesus Christ during their
&quot;Quiet Times&quot;, and they made a habit of writing down the messages every day.
Russell then assembled those messages into a book and published them as some new
scriptures from Jesus Christ:

<p>
PHILADELPHIA, Feb 15. &#8212; Spiritualistic phenomena, Buchmanism,
Biblical Miracles and conversion were discussed by speakers today
at the opening session of the two-day conference of liberal
clergymen of the Episcopal Church, who attended from all parts of
the country.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Rev. Dr. Walter F. Prince of New York, Secretary of the Psychic
Research Society, told how the Rev. William H. Morgan, a Methodist
minister of New York, experienced a complete change in his views
on theology as result of an all-night communication with the spirit
of his dead wife.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Rev. W. T. Snead of Beverly, N. J., then declared that &quot;castor
oil and calomel would clear up most of the cases of psychic
experiences&quot; and asked about &quot;premonitions that did not
come true.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Rev. Samuel Shoemaker Jr., rector of Trinity Church, New York,
in a paper on Buchmanism, likened its founder, Frank Buchman, to
John Wesley and George Fox in that &quot;he had the courage to go
into our highest social circles and tell people what they are.&quot;<br>

The sycophant Sam Shoemaker's hero-worshipping remarks were simply untrue.
Frank Buchman did not tell the rich, the famous, and the titled nobility
&quot;what they are&quot;.
Frank Buchman did that to the poor. Towards the rich,
Frank's behavior would be better described by the word
&quot;<i><a href="orange-rroot180.html#collect_the_rich" target="_blank">grovelling</a></i>&quot;.

<a name="Gnostic_heresy"> </a>
Another important concept in Buchmanism is the idea that
everyone has been &quot;defeated by sin&quot;, and is &quot;insane&quot;.
Buchman redefined the word &quot;sanity&quot; to mean &quot;living according to
the Will of God&quot; and &quot;insanity&quot; was living a life not &quot;Guided&quot;
by God.
Thus, only Frank Buchman and his
arrogant followers were sane; everyone else in
the world was &quot;insane&quot; and in need of Frank's
<i>&quot;Guidance&quot;</i>. Thus Buchman taught that people were
incapable of running their own lives, and needed to surrender to
<i>&quot;God-control&quot;</i> (i.e.: to Frank-control). A Buchmanite text teaches:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What we want to do is get in touch with Him and turn our lives
over to Him. Where should we go to do it?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At once the lad replied:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;There is only one place &#8212; on our knees.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The lad prayed &#8212; one of those powerful, simple prayers which
are so quickly heard by Him who made the eye and the ear: &quot;Oh
Lord, manage me, for I cannot manage myself.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>For Sinners Only</i>, A. J. Russell,
(Harper &amp; Brothers, New York and London, 1932), p. 62.<br></font>
</blockquote>

<p>
That theology is a Gnostic heresy. One aspect of Gnostic theology was the idea that this world and
all of the people in it were irredeemably corrupt:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The earth and life on it are irredeemably evil, and separation from earthly life is precisely
salvation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... The Gnostic view is that this world was the creation of an evil spirit. Matter itself is chaos;
it is the baser half of their dualistic universe.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Gosticism's pretense to exclusive divine knowledge is also implicitly millenarian, for prophetic
knowledge is often exactly of this kind; suitable only for the awareness of a select few who can
comprehend it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>A Doomsday Reader: Prophets, Predictors, and Hucksters of Salvation</i>,

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Buchmanism declared that you were inherently so corrupt and evil that you were incapable of
managing your own life or of doing good things with your own free will,
and that salvation was <i>only</i>
possible through surrendering control of your life and your mind to &quot;God&quot;
(i.e., to Frank Buchman and his minions who were supposedly in closer contact with God than you were).
That is a heresy, in direct conflict with the Christian
idea that you can repent your sins, change your ways, and choose to live a good life.
Christianity generally believes in free will; Buchmanism teaches that you are
the powerless slave of evil impulses, hopelessly &quot;defeated by sin&quot;.

Alcoholics Anonymous teaches exactly the same heresy. (Of course &#8212; it pushes
the same very package of theology: Alcoholics Anonymous <b><i>is</i></b> Buchmanism.)
A.A. teaches that you are a helpless insane slave of evil impulses &#8212; that you are
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<p>
A.A. Step One says:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#8212;
that our lives had become unmanageable.
</font>
<p>
So you are powerless over evil &#8212; alcohol, Demon Rum, in this case &#8212; and you cannot
control your own actions and manage your own life.
The only answer for you is A.A. Steps Two and Three, where you
achieve &quot;sanity&quot; by surrendering your mind and your life to
the control and direction of some &quot;Higher Power&quot; or &quot;God&quot;:
<p>
<font color="#4f007f">
<ul>
<li> 2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could

</ul>

The original version of Step Three included the words
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;and direction&quot;</font>,
which made the Buchmanite doctrine of <i>Obeying Guidance</i> much more obvious.
So Bill Wilson deleted those words from the second edition of the <i>Big Book</i>.

Frank Buchman was also in love with the word &quot;<font color="#9F0000">obey</font>&quot;.
Oxford Group slogans declared:
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When man listens, God speaks. When man obeys, God acts.

Frank Buchman, speaking at the opening of the Moral Re-Armament Training Center,
Mackinac Island, Michigan, July 1943, quoted in<br>

page 201.

<li>

But note that somehow Frank Buchman always managed to twist things around
so that &quot;obeying God&quot; ended up meaning that everybody had to
agree with Frank and do what Frank said. Everybody had to
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank"><i>check their guidance</i>
with Frank or his lieutenants</a>, and then Frank decided what God was
really saying and what God was really ordering them to do.

Again and again, Buchman declared that people could not manage their own lives,
that they must obey God and follow God's orders (as interpreted by Frank Buchman or his
lieutenants):
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
God alone can change human nature. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
God made the world, and man has been trying to run it ever since.

but through groups of people who have learned to work together under
the guidance of God.<br>

Vic Kitchen, another one of Buchman's dedicated followers, agreed:
<p>
<blockquote>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My own political thought therefore no longer looks to political expedients for a real answer.
It is given to the possibilities of theocracy under the Oxford Group and other
working Christians in all sections of the world.
Our old system of democracy, like our old system of economics, is gone &#8212; never to return.
No intermediate stage of man-made adjustment is likely to linger with us for
very long. Therefore, on whether you and I accept this new awakening of the Holy Spirit,
depends the outcome of present political experiments. They will not escape disaster
unless the tide turns to God. There, and there only, lies the Nation's Real Advantage
&#8212; a &quot;new deal&quot; of the kind that enables everyone to hold a winning hand, and the
only programme which enables everyone to play a vital part.<br>

Frank Buchman's definition of &quot;democracy&quot; was downright Orwellian:
<p>
<blockquote>

An increasing number of citizens in democratic states are now unwilling
to acknowledge in speech and action those inner authorities on which
the life of democracy depends. Each man has his own plan.
It's so wonderful each to have his own plan. It's such freedom, such liberty!
Everyone does as he pleases. But not in the Oxford Group. There you have
true democracy. You don't do as you please, you do as God guides.
You do God's plan.<br>

There we again see
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak" target="_blank">the common cultish practice of redefining words</a>, of <i>loading the
language</i>, as
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Dr. Robert J. Lifton</a> called it.
Inside of a cult, words take on
new meanings which are quite different from their accepted meanings outside of
the cult. In Buchmanism,
<ul>
<li> &quot;True democracy&quot; meant that you were a slave of a
dictatorial God, living only to obey His orders, and you were not allowed to vote on
anything. You also got no freedom of speech, and you were not even allowed to have
an opinion that differed from Frank's opinion. That was &quot;inspired democracy&quot;.
<li> Allegedly, subjecting people to such slavery &quot;sets them free&quot; and gives them
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot930.html#freedom_slavery" target="_blank">true freedom of the spirit</a>&quot;.
<li> &quot;Sanity&quot; meant living a life where your every action was dictated by
the whims of God as expressed to you in your <i>Quiet Time</i>,
or as dictated to you by the Oxford Group leaders, and
&quot;insanity&quot; meant doing what you wished to do with your life.
<li> In the Oxford Groups, &quot;Conservation&quot; meant &quot;go recruit
more members&quot;.
<li> &quot;Sharing&quot; meant reciting stories about how wonderful Frank Buchman and the
Oxford Groups were, while confessing how stupid and sinful you were.
<li> &quot;Materialism&quot; meant striving to get something more substantial
to eat than Frank Buchman's spirituality, behavior which Frank considered
to be very selfish and evil.<br>

Bill Wilson echoed Frank Buchman's and Peter Howard's fascist

The notion that we would still live our own lives, God helping

Many of us who had thought ourselves religious awoke to the limitations

But now the words &quot;Of myself

<p>
<font color="blue">
(When Bill Wilson said
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#humility_def" target="_blank">humility</a>&quot;,
he really meant subservience and obedience.)
</font>

<p>
This shines a whole new light on the first three steps of
Alcoholics Anonymous.
<ul>
<li> In Step One, when people admit
that they are powerless over alcohol, and that their lives have
become unmanageable, that is really
just the Buchmanite defeated-by-sin confession, only slightly
edited.
<p>
<li> The second Step,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We came to believe that only God ('a Power greater than ourselves')
could restore us to sanity&quot;
</font>
is actually referring to Frank Buchman's idea of insanity, the one
caused by sin, not some temporary insanity
caused by drinking too much alcohol. If you think about it for a
minute, it makes sense. You
don't really need a miracle or God to get you out of the
temporary insanity caused by drinking too
much alcohol; a few days or weeks of sobering up will usually do
it. You only need <i>The Big
Miracle</i> to totally transform you, and remove all sin from your
life.
<p>
Now some of the current A.A. faithful may disagree, and say that they
saw themselves as insane in the Second Step because they were
suicidally drinking impossible quantities of alcohol, and
couldn't stop. That may be; sometimes
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#alice" target="_blank">words just mean what we
want them to mean</a>. But plenty of the old faithful will tell you
that the <i>insanity</i> refers to living a life of sin, and
that <i><b>&quot;Sanity
is living according to God's Will, rather than one's own.&quot;</b></i>

<p>
<li> Then, in the third Step, where you<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Turn your will and
your life over to the care [and direction] of God,&quot;</font><br>
that is really just Frank Buchman's<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Turn your will and your life over to the control of God&quot;</font><br>
doctrine, only slightly re-worded.
</ul>

<p>
And in his second book, <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, Bill Wilson
redefined the word &quot;humility&quot; to require
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;a desire to seek and do God's will&quot;</font>
<font size="-1">(page 72)</font>.
So Bill's line in that last quote about,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;We saw that we needn't always be bludgeoned and beaten into humility&quot;
</font>
really means that Bill's followers needed to be beaten and bludgeoned into following
the orders of &quot;God, <i>as we understood Him</i>&quot; &#8212; or God as Bill Wilson
and the Oxford Groups understood Him.
<p>
It's just like how Bill Wilson declared that
A.A. members who disagreed with him
 &#8212; who were &quot;obstinate&quot; and &quot;prejudiced&quot;
(like <a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">Ed the atheist</a>)
 &#8212; needed to get beaten into believing in Bill Wilson's religion
 &#8212; &quot;beaten into a state of reasonableness&quot; &#8212; beaten into &quot;having faith&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>

Besides a seeming inability to accept much on
faith, we found ourselves handicapped by obstinacy,
sensitiveness, and unreasoning prejudice.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
In this respect alcohol was a great persuader. It finally beat us into a
state of reasonableness. Sometimes this was a tedious
process; we hope no one else will be prejudiced for as
long as some of us were.<br>

Absolute Honesty, Absolute Love, and Absolute Unselfishness;

Note that the &quot;Four Absolutes&quot; are pretty typical cult fare.
Many cults make impossible demands for

making members feel inadequate and inferior, which is good for

pointed out that...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... the Four Absolutes, when compared with any of the classical codes of ethics,
do not form a well-balanced or comprehensive rule of life.

They read as if they were framed on the spur of the moment, in a
flash of Guidance, by Dr Buchman; and as if, since 'Frank's guidance was
always right', nobody ventured to question his authority and to
suggest that other Absolutes, too, might be required.

&nbsp;
... there is in
this code no mention of the social virtue of justice or of the personal
virtue of humility. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In any case, is <i>absolute</i> honesty or purity (in the MRA sense of the word)
really desirable? To quote the usual examples of the justified 'white lie':
if a violent psychopath is looking for a gun, the honest citizen is not
obliged, when asked, to tell him where it is; and it is not sinful dishonesty,
but common courtesy, to let a worthy bore think that you are glad to see him.
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
An advocate of MRA has no right to shrug off such examples as absurdly extreme
cases in which common sense would obviously come into play: 'of course we
wouldn't behave so extravagantly'. For extravagant behavior is exactly what
the Absolutes require. If you tell the psychopath that you don't know where
the gun is, when you do, you are not being absolutely honest.
This is the cleft stick into which MRA's absolutism forces its disciples:
either they must behave extravagantly or they fall into dishonesty &#8212; 
minor dishonesty which they are debarred from calling, as others would
call it, excusable. So, by deliberate training, they must come to lack that
most precious of civilised human attributes, a sense of proportion.<br>

Beverly Nichols was
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Beverly_Nichols19" target="_blank">a member of the Oxford Groups for a while</a>,
and wrote about his
experiences there. This was his analysis of the <i>Four Absolutes</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness and absolute love. Those are the
four pillars which are supposed to sustain the fabric of this movement.
Let us consider them one by one.
<p>
<i>Absolute Honesty</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If this is taken as only applying to oneself, if it is confined to a ruthless personal
examination, it is obviously desirable, not only as a religious exercise but as a commonplace
of everyday conduct. We are all inclined to fool and flatter ourselves, drawing rosy
veils over the harsh outlines of the Ego. It can do none of us harm to sit down quietly,
from time to time, and look ourselves squarely in the face. If we look long enough
and deeply enough we shall see, behind our own image, another image, either of good or
of evil. It is always there; and we might as well find out, or try to find out, which it is.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But if 'absolute honesty' means, as it has come to mean in the Oxford Group, a giggling
exhibitionism, from people who really
have not so very much to exhibit, then it is drab and morbid.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This slogan is the result of cheap and muddled thinking, for falsehood is the
foundation of almost everything that raises man above the level of the brute.
The essential difference between a man and an animal is that man has learned to lie;
this, though it may outrage the susceptibilities of the R.S.P.C.A., is a point in
favour of man. An animal cannot disguise its rages, its pains nor its appetites;
if it is hungry it must howl, if it is frightened it must run away, if it is
angry it must snarl and bare its teeth.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Man &#8212; except in certain degraded institutions like the House of Commons &#8212; does not behave
like that. He has learned better. He can and often does disguise his passions, and disguise
is the first step towards control.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If this is true of his life as an individual, it is doubly true of his life in the family.
I have known five marriages that were wrecked by the Oxford Group &#8212; by this pernicious practice
of 'absolute honesty'. In each case they were wrecked by totally unnecessary confessions of a
sexual nature. In two of these cases there was not even any question of physical misconduct;
the husbands, in an orgy of self-exposure, merely admitted that their eyes had wandered,
and that they had been tempted by other women. Such admissions, once in a way, may possibly
clear the air &#8212; though even that is doubtful; as a regular feature of married life they
are humiliating and intolerable.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Family life is a fabric of delicate half-truths and heroic lies; and the universal application
of Oxford Group principles would utterly destroy it.

<p>
<i>Absolute Purity</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This is another example of muddled thinking. Absolute purity, if it means anything at all,
means complete sexual repression of all occasions not directly aimed at the reproduction
of the species. That, in my opinion, is poison and lunacy.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For the word 'repression' the Groupers substitute the word 'sublimation', which is prettier,
and can be intoned with the eyes raised to the ceiling. They have, of course, a case there.
There are many noble examples in history of men and women who, having been denied the
consolations of normal love &#8212; even more often, of abnormal love &#8212; have directed their
pent-up energies to the service of some great cause. I do not wish to give unnecessary
offence, and so I will refrain from the temptation to make a list of some of the world's
saints whose whole lives are an example of the sublimation of sex.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But though one can pay sincere tribute to these people, it is neither possible nor desirable
for the rest of the world to follow their example. For the vast majority of men and women,
sexual sublimation is prohibited by the very conditions of their social existence;
at best they can only achieve a sort of grudging and half-hearted repression, by which their
lives will be neither sweetened nor simplified.<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<i>[I have to interject a note here: While we are talking about saintly sexual sublimation
and the huge energies released in
the service of some great cause, I can't help but think of one person
who managed to sublimate almost all of his sexual energy, and who was
famous for moving Heaven and Earth in the pursuit of his great cause.
He was a very pure individual &#8212; so pure that he was also
a non-smoker, a non-drinker, and a semi-vegetarian. His name was Adolf Hitler.]</i>

<i>Absolute Unselfishness</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I should have to bring a whole collection of family skeletons rattling out of the cupboard to
explain why I mistrust this apparently spotless ideal. All I care to say here is that I have
seen several people's lives brought to the brink of ruin because of
one woman's absolute unselfishness. If you strip this vague and mushy ideal to its
essentials, how does it reveal itself?
As a complete abrogation of the rights of the individual concerned.
For example, an absolutely unselfish wife must endure, year in and year out, the
persecution of a drunkard. She must never assert herself, never speak harshly to him,
never protest when he revolts her sensibilities, terrifies her children, turns her
house into a lunatic asylum, gambles away her money.
<font color="blue">
'It is not <i>him</i>,' she must say. 'It is a disease.'</font>
Or again: 'I took him for better or for worse; I must
endure to the end.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such women exist by the thousand; the Oxford Group approves of them; I do not.
They are magnificent but mad.
Unselfishness, if carried to these extremes, is an obsession that does nothing
but prolong unnecessary pain. (Read Stefan Zweig's <i>Beware of Pity</i>.)<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue">
<i>[The resemblance to the Alcoholics Anonymous wives' group,
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Al_Anon_quotes" target="_blank">Al-Anon</a>&quot;,
is glaringly obvious. The Oxford Groups really are the religious and philosophical roots of 
Al-Anon, too. Bill Wilson's wife Lois, who ostensibly founded Al-Anon,
was also a member of the Oxford Groups, and she obviously carried that baggage with
her.]</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<i>Absolute Love</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This is the only one of the four standards which I can accept without difficulty &#8212; 
though I do not consider that it robs a man of his right to lose his temper in the face
of cruelty and oppression, nor, having lost it, to give violent expression to his
indignation. However, I have not really the philosophical equipment to argue about this;
I can only refer the reader to a previous passage, in which I confessed to a feeling
that if only my faith were strong enough, I could walk into the cages of lions without
hurt.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is some important truth here &#8212; important in the sense that any completely honest confession
of any man on such a subject is important. What it is, I hardly know.
All I know is that I &#8212; as a unit in the creative plan &#8212; am linked in love to all
the superficially evil things in creation &#8212; to bullies and cowards and thieves, to snakes
and toads and 'things that go bump in the night' &#8212; to Hitler and Nero and the Borgias and all the
human beasts who, from any man-made standards of right and wrong, are inexcusable, and
exist only to be crushed under foot. These being I accept and embrace.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
How is it possible to live life on any other terms? How is it possible to draw the curtains and look
up to the sky and greet the sun? You cannot split the world into partitions, apportion it into
tiny squares of approval and disapproval. You must take it and grip it with the whole of your hand,
and the whole of your heart, nettles and all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The mystics know the truth of this. Their eyes are clear always; they are not like ourselves,
who see a gleam of moonlit truth, follow it down a shadowed glade of doubt, and end up in the dark,
clasping our hands in despair in an avenue of barren branches. <i>They</i> know. But
sometimes <i>we</i> know too.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And this is what I know. That all is lovable. That all is meet and ordained and perfect.
The poison in the fang of the serpent &#8212; that is right. The clouds over the brain of the lunatic &#8212; 
they are correctly disposed. The folly in my own heart, the tinkling of the clown's bells that
echo through my brain, they have their appointed harmony. And one day, through the discord, I
shall hear the tune, and spell it out, and know it for the music that it is.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I had no intention of posing as a spiritual saboteur, but when Ned [Barton]
and a young English friend, Aylmer, talked me into going with them on
a &quot;guidance walk&quot;,
I took along the explosives that had been accumulating in my mind since I first
heard of Frank N. Buchman.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In response to their exaggerated praise of the man, I contended that his genius
lay in the appropriation of other men's ideas. &quot;Your four absolutes,&quot;
I recounted, &quot;came from Henry B. Wright, who got them from Robert E. Speer, who
got them from Henry Drummond, who very likely got them from someone else.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Aylmer responded to my mention of these men with &quot;Never heard of them!&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I was in the awkward position of an outside informant enlightening the neophytes.
They did not know that the workable technique which Buchman had popularized had
been tested in the laboratory of a Yale professor's life. At the time of his
death in 1923, Henry B. Wright was collaborating with Buchman on a treatise devoted
to personal religion. Wright's earlier publication, <i>The Will of God and a Man's Life Work</i>,
was Buchman's text. Before Buchman became famous, he confessed that much of
the best in his message had come from Henry B. Wright. It was Wright who made Buchman
&quot;system-conscious&quot;;
it was Wright who taught him the first words of his spiritual
lingo.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt057" target="_blank">57</a></sup></font><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Neither of my companions on this morning walk was impressed or disturbed
by my expos&eacute; of their leader. Aylmer, with a gesture of unconcern,
said, &quot;All that may be true,
but don't we always ascribe originality to the man who makes a thing memorable?
And you'll have to admit that F. B. has certainly sold the Oxford Group idea to the world.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;But I must protest against the use of that name,&quot; I retorted. &quot;There
was an Oxford Group long before Buchman ever set foot in your country, Aylmer.
It was initiated in 1833 and was intended to clarify the position of the Anglican Church
in light of its higher function. I've often hear the charge that Buchman was never
averse to capitalizing on the prestige this name afforded. It slyly put him into
the company of men like John Henry Newman and John Keble and tied him to a great
tradition in a way that was downright misleading.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Aylmer deprecatingly, &quot;let's not quibble about that.&quot;<br>

More Buchmanism: <b>The Five Procedures of the Sane</b>:
<ol>
<li> Guidance
<li> Checking Guidance
<li> Giving in to God
<li> Restitution
<li> Sharing
</ol>
<p>
What they meant was:
<ol>
<li> Guidance == Conduct a s&eacute;ance and &quot;listen to God&quot; talking to you.
<li> Checking Guidance  == Ask the cult elders whether they agree with what you think God said.
<li> Giving in to God == &quot;Surrender&quot; to the &quot;guidance&quot; and do what the voices in your head tell you to do.
<li> Restitution  ==  Go around apologizing and making amends to all whom you have offended.
<li> Sharing  == Deliver testimonials at meetings, &quot;sharing&quot; stories
of how you lived a decadent life of terrible sin until you were saved by
Dr. Frank Buchman's wonderful religion.

And more Buchmanism: <b>&quot;The Five C's&quot;</b>: These steps were the
procedure for recruiting more members. The most important duty of
members was to &quot;win more souls&quot; for the Group. The five
C's were:
<ol>
<li> Confidence
<li> Confession
<li> Conviction
<li> Conversion
<li> Conservation
</ol>
<p>
What they meant was:
<ol>
<p><li> First, the recruiter got the prospect's Confidence and
trust by utilizing whatever mind games were required.
<font color="blue">
&nbsp;
(Yes, it's a &quot;con&quot; &#8212; a <i>confidence</i> game.)</font>

<p><li> Then, the recruiter Confessed something to the prospect
in order to get his trust,
and encouraged him to Confess something about himself in return.

Gradually, the recruiter pressured the prospect to Confess
all of his innermost dirty little secrets. The Oxford Group manual
called &quot;<a href="soulsurgery.pdf">Soul Surgery</a>&quot; tells us that recruiters must
be &quot;lovingly relentless&quot; in insisting that a confession be made.

<p><li> Then came Conviction &#8212; the recruiter betrayed the prospect's trust,
and turned his confession around and used
it against him, amplifying and exaggerating it,
in order to make the prospect feel as guilty as possible.
The recruiter got the prospect to 'Convict' himself of sins &#8212; that
is, to find himself guilty of having committed many sins and to confess that
he was a worthless sinner who had been defeated by sin.

<p><li> Then, the recruiter held out religious Conversion as the only
way to escape from the feelings of guilt.
The prospect was told that he must &quot;surrender himself to God&quot;
(really, surrender to the Oxford Group recruiters).

<p><li> And the last 'C' was &quot;Conservation&quot;, which was
somehow redefined to mean that the new convert had to go out
and recruit more new cult members, using the same Five C's as
were just used on him, doing unto others what had just been
done unto him.

The first thing in trying to help other alcoholics is to get their confidence. We
do this by telling them our own experiences with drinking, so that they see that
we know what we're talking about.
If we share our experiences frankly, they will know that we are sincerely trying
to help them.
They will realize that they're not alone and that others have had experiences as
bad or worse than theirs. This gives them confidence that they can be helped.

Note the similarity between Buchman's routine for conversion
of prospects, and the
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds" target="_blank">
Red Chinese brainwashing</a> that was inflicted on the American,
British, and other United Nations soldiers in North Korea
during the Korean War:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Reds had found that the easiest way to subdue any group of
people was to give its members a guilt complex and then to lead
them on from self-denunciation to self-betrayal.
All that was required to put this across was a
sufficiently heartless exploitation of the essential
goodness in people, so that they would seek self-sacrifice
to compensate for their feelings of guilt.
The self-sacrifice
obviously made available to them in this inside-out environment
is some form of treason.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Brainwashing, From Pavlov to Powers</i>,
Edward Hunter, page 169.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
In Buchman's cult, the self-sacrifice that was made available
to the guilt-ridden new convert
was the chance to surrender to the cult, and become a slave of
the cult, and spend the rest of his life <i>&quot;Under God-Control&quot;</i>,
&quot;Seeking and Doing
the Will of God&quot; (as Buchman and his lieutenants defined it),
and, of course, recruiting more members for the cult.
<p>
Another vital ingredient for a good brainwashing program is
a method for inducing a sense of helplessness or powerlessness in the victims.
Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer listed that as one of her
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html#comparison" target="_blank">five essential conditions</a>
for an effective mind-control program &#8212;
<font color="#cf0000">
<i>&quot;Create a sense of
powerlessness, covert fear, guilt, and dependency.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
The Red Chinese guards could easily induce such feelings of helplessness and fear &#8212;
their victims were already prisoners of war, and the guards could
randomly, arbitrarily, punish or kill whomever they chose, and they did.
Buchman induced a sense of helplessness and fear by declaring that everyone
was defeated by sin and incapable of running his or her own life
(and presumably doomed to Hell unless saved by Buchman),
because even their thinking was corrupted by sin &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Oh Lord, manage me, for I cannot manage myself.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue"><i>
Note: That similarity may not be coincidental at all. Dr. Frank Buchman
went to China as a Lutheran missionary in 1915, 1916, and 1918, and taught
the Chinese his strange guilt-inducing methods of religious conversion.
Is it just a big coincidence that 30 years later, the Chinese Communists
had coercive conversion techniques that are almost identical to
Frank Buchman's techniques?

The Oxford Group member A. J. Russell wrote the following instructions
for extracting confessions from prospective converts:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
People will argue for hours on points of doctrine and selfishly waste the Life-Changer's
time unless he realises the need for isolating the main sin. If a man is known to be a drunkard,
a Christian worker talks on that aspect of the contact's experience and shows how Christ's
power can work through him to victory.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But there are many hidden sins that have to be talked about and shared if others, seemingly perfectly
respectable, are to be won. The earnest evangelist for Jesus will be led to discover
the weak spot and be guided to say the right thing to strengthen it. For He who
inspires the Life-Changer is also at the same moment working with the contact, since
&quot;every thought of holiness is His alone.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But do not waste time proving the whole Bible, defending every renegade rector, or every
Christian hypocrite. Time is too short, even to defend yourself. Admit your own
mistakes rather, and then both stand face to face with Christ Jesus.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Soon you will be hearing which of Christ's four standards of purity, honesty, love, or
unselfishness the other is breaking. Then challenge!<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is a practical way. It works.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once we wasted several hours urging a youth to surrender, but we were held up because
we did not know his problem. Some days later, when he revealed it after we had gained
his confidence by admitting that we had once been beaten by the same sin, he made his
full decision in a few minutes, and witnessed boldly that night to a thousand people.<br>

Notice the extreme arrogance of that Oxford Group proselytizer: Arthur James Russell said
that people who disagreed with him and refused to immediately confess and surrender to him were
&quot;selfishly wasting his time&quot;.<br>
</font>
<font color="#8F0000">
It doesn't seem to have occurred to Russell that he might be selfishly
wasting other people's time with his dogmatic nonsense and invasion of
other people's privacy.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
A. J. Russell displayed arrogance in another way, too: He sneered at
those who wished to argue points of doctrine, or to dispute his interpretation
of the Bible. He was quite sure that they were wrong and he was right
&#8212; so sure and so right that the debate was not even worth having. It would just
be &quot;a waste of his time&quot;, he said.
<p>
(And A. J. Russell was actually following Frank Buchman's instructions to
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot120.html#avoid_argument" target="_blank">Avoid argument</a>&quot; and
&quot;Aim to conduct the interview yourself&quot;
&#8212; side-track all attempts at honest criticism by dodging the questions
and refusing to answer or discuss critical questions.)
<p>
Then of course there was the obvious arrogant assumption that every person whom they approached,
no matter how &quot;perfectly respectable&quot; in appearance, was really a sinner
who was separated from God by a &quot;main sin&quot; that he or she needed to confess to an Oxford
Group recruiter. And the O.G. recruiter was supposedly so spiritually skilled that
he was able to identify that sin, and then he was entitled to accuse his target of that sin,
even if the O.G. recruiter was just a young inexperienced college dropout.
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#AJRussell_arrogant2" target="_blank">A. J. Russell was actually so arrogant</a>
that he even declared that those who criticized the Oxford Group cult
recruiters (like him) were &quot;refusing to put God first in their
lives&quot;, as if the Oxford Group was the same thing as God.

<p>

Also notice the author's use of the propaganda tricks
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#mislabeling" target="_blank">Deception Via Mislabeling
or Misnaming Things</a> and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#association" target="_blank">Association</a>.
A. J. Russell surreptitiously told people that the <i>Four Absolutes</i>
were not something that Frank Buchman made up, or copied
from Prof. Henry B. Wright &#8212; <br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Soon you will be hearing which of Christ's four standards of purity, honesty, love, or
unselfishness the other is breaking.&quot;<br>
</font>
No, suddenly Frank Buchman's goofy Four Absolutes were supposedly &quot;the four
standards of Jesus Christ&quot; &#8212; an assertion for which there is not
a shred of Biblical support. Jesus Christ simply did not go around
yammering about &quot;The Four Absolutes&quot;, not ever.
<p>
Likewise, Russell described the Oxford Group recruiting work as
&quot;winning people for Jesus&quot;, which is also a groundless assumption.
Many Christian churches,
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban" target="_blank">including the Roman Catholics</a>, saw Frank Buchman's
theology as leading people <i>away from</i> Jesus, not towards Him.

lives on four levels &#8212;  spiritual, intellectual, social, and physical

the soul surgeon
must be lovingly relentless in insisting that the confession be made</font>,
when and where it is needed. It is often the kind of drastic, spiritual
operation which alone can prevent a superficial repentance and unreal conversion.<br>

stand in need of moral surgery. &nbsp; ...<br>
...<br>
Our first business at this point is to discover through the lips of the
patient whether there is a sin hitherto unconfessed and unforgiven, by which
the soul has been insulated from contact with the life-giving power of Christ.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>Never betray an appearance of shocked surprise.</i> Such an attitude will
assuredly dry up confidence at the roots, and militate against any continuance
of friendly service on our part. It usually results from inexperience on the
personal worker's side, for the wider his knowledge of the real world of men and
events, the less is he likely openly to stand aghast (however deeply pained
in spirit) at any of the revelations that may be necessary to lay bare before
him the inner life of his patient.<br>

So college students with a few months of experience in proselytizing for the
Oxford Groups and
hearing confessions were supposed to put on airs of being worldly and experienced &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I've heard it all before. Nothing is new under the sun...&quot;</i></font>
So much for the Group's <i>Absolute Honesty</i>.
<p>
<a name="confidential"> </a>
Also note that no real training was required before an Oxford Grouper began
hearing confessions. Catholic priests spend years in a seminary to
prepare them for their jobs, but not Buchmanites. Go to a few meetings, read a
small book, and you are ready to hear other peoples' intimate secrets.
<p>
Speaking of priests, they are sworn to secrecy. The confidentiality of the
confessional is considered absolutely sacred and inviolate. What about the
confidentiality of confessions made to Oxford Group recruiters?
H. A. Walter wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Finally, <i>keep every confidence absolutely sacred.</i>
This counsel may seem superfluous because the need of observing it is so
obvious; and yet we often do not realize how easily we may let slip a remark
about some person into whose confidence we have come, which may reveal
to another more than we think.
The professional honour of the physician is of the utmost importance here,
as every priest is compelled to learn. Unless people come to feel an entire
reliance on our discretionary silence they assuredly will not trust us.
Many a potential life-changer is severely handicapped because he (or she)
has never acquired this great and costly gift of silence. They may need to
pray not now for a new heart, but for a new tongue.<br>

So, the Oxford Group recruiters were not actually sworn to secrecy,
or sworn to keep confessions confidential, and
<font color="#BF0000">

And what happened to those Groupers who gossiped? Apparently, nothing except that
people stopped trusting them.

And what about the people who quit the Oxford Group
and then revealed other people's secrets? What could be done in that situation?
Not much.

And of course A.A. has the same problem today.
What is heard in the meeting room is supposed to

Another reflection on the Oxford Group recruiters &#8212; &quot;soul surgeons&quot;
&#8212; being &quot;lovingly relentless&quot; in their pursuit of a confession:
A contemporary warned a young Oxford Group convert about the Groupists'
recruiting methods with these words:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Only do be careful of spiritual exhibitionism and self-exposure.
<i>Verb. sap.</i> And do handle folk gently. Sometimes, on rare occasions,
you'll have to use the knife I know, but don't use it unless it's
absolutely necessary. Never think of yourself as a first-rate surgeon.
There's a bit of the sadist, of the unconscious desire to prove our
power by hurting people, in most of us, and sometimes the surgeon metaphor
has been the excuse for spiritual sadism. First-year medicals aren't
allowed to conduct major operations.<br>

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
But all of that talk about <i>Absolute Honesty</i> in making confessions
was actually just so much hypocrisy.
Beverly Nichols, who was a member of the Oxford Groups for a short while,
told how he discovered that it was all just a well-rehearsed act,
and he told this story of how his attempt to sincerely follow
Frank Buchman's instructions and really confess everything to the Oxford
Group didn't work out at all well:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Smith said: 'You must come to Oxford. There is an international meeting of the Group.
It will be a revelation to you.'<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was. Oxford was packed with young men and women from all nations; there must have been
thousands of them &#8212; all gathered in the name of Christ, to testify to the reality of the
'change' in their lives, to carry through the world four radiant banners emblazoned with
the slogans:<br>
<center>
ABSOLUTE HONESTY<br>
ABSOLUTE PURITY<br>
ABSOLUTE UNSELFISHNESS<br>
ABSOLUTE LOVE<br>
</center>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The c&agrave;fes were crowded with Groupers, the High Street seemed afire with shining faces,
and as the <i>comble</i> of the festivities there was a giant meeting at which, under
arc lights, young men and women from every walk of life, came forward to offer themselves
in the service of Our Lord.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I was swept in. It was heady stuff. I did not realize, at the time, how carefully
staged it all was, how these apparent neophytes from the factories, the services,
the stage, were actually engaged in putting on an act that was very well rehearsed.
I am not suggesting that they did not believe in it, nor that they were animated
by any other emotion than pure evangelism, but there is a difference between a
spontaneous confession and one that is made twice nightly. Perhaps this is
cavilling, for obviously, if you try to apply the technique of modern salesmanship
to the teaching of Our Lord, you must borrow some tricks from the music hall.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Public confession was Doctor Buchman's trump drawing card, and he was shrewd enough
to play it with great skill. (The Groupers call it 'sharing').
I must have been exceptionally simple to have been so impressed by this farce.
I listened enthralled to dozens of these confessions, some from women,
some from men, all pouring out their souls on public platforms,
beating their breasts and crying <i>mea culpa</i> &#8212; and I thought:
'How noble of them, how selfless, how cleansing to their souls!'
Never once did it occur to me that they were not really pouring out their
souls at all, that they were not 'coming clean'.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For there was one little subject that was scarcely ever mentioned in these
revelations, and that was sex.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sex &#8212; by which I mean the real stuff, raw and naked, with all of nature's arrogant
obscenity &#8212; might never have troubled these people at all. They dilated at length
on other shortcomings; they had been unkind to their sisters, or rude to their
servants, or sharp with their tradesmen. One young man admitted that when he was a
boy he had stolen a ten-shilling note, and several owned up to cheating in exams
&#8212; though I noted that the exams were usually unimportant and at a convenient
distance of time.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But nobody, male or female, ever stood up and confessed to visiting a brothel, or
committing adultery or even to romping too vigorously at school. One pimply young
man stammered out that he had had peculiar sensations during a recent visit
to the Folies Berg&eacute;res, but just when he was getting to what appeared to
be the point, Doctor Buchman rang the bell and up popped a bright young Welsh
miner who floated us away on a tide of high falutin stuff about the new spirit
in the heart of the working man.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Dr. Buchman, of course, <i>had</i> to ring the bell; if he had not done so,
if he had allowed men and women to draw the curtain which veiled their real
selves from the world, the meetings would have been closed by the police.
This very fact robbed the confessions of any value.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The sexual question was the occasion for the first cold glimmer of reason which pierced the
rosy mist of my visit to Oxford.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One night I decided that the time had come for me to 'share' myself. I had been dining with
a number of the Groupers in the hall of one of the colleges. After dinner there was a brief
meeting and some prayers, and then we split up into twos and threes and wandered about the
gardens and talked. This was a recognized hour for 'sharing'; the combination of a good
dinner, a summer moon and a quantity of discreet and ancient cedar trees were calculated
to loosen the strings of the heart if of nothing else.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So I decided to get it over. The decision was made with no pleasurable anticipation; it was
strongly against my natural inclinations; but I was so captivated by the Buchman technique
that it seemed the only thing to do. I would tell all.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My confidante was a dark, attractive girl who had been sitting opposite me at dinner.
She was ideal for the purpose; she was &#8212; or so it seemed &#8212; <i>du monde</i>; she claimed
a fervent admiration for the works of Aldous Huxley &#8212; though she added that it was such a
pity that he was not 'changed'; she even let loose a tripping allusion to the Marquis de Sade.
To one with such a broad outlook, I felt, my own sexual short-comings would be very small beer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So I said to her: 'I'd like to talk to you.' She said: 'Of course,' and linked her arm in mine.
Together we strolled over to the shade of the nearest unoccupied cedar tree.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We sat down and I said to her: 'If you don't mind, I'd rather turn my back while I tell you
this. Some of it will be difficult.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And she said: 'Of course.' And then she added, very brightly, 'It's always difficult.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Good!' I thought. 'She's had it before. She won't be shocked. And anyway &#8212; 
even if she <i>is</i> &#8212; that's the whole point of the thing. If what one says is not
shocking, it's obviously not true. So here goes...'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And I began, speaking softly into the shadows, my hands clasped over my knees. You need not
tell me that the whole scene was farcical. But at that moment it did not seem so; it seemed
a part, and a beautiful part, of the Divine Comedy.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I shut my eyes; I was searching for the truth, however shameful. And then, suddenly behind
me, I heard a gasp. I paid no attention, and went on talking. The gasp was followed by a high-pitched
'Oh! <i>Really!</i>' There was a rustle as she sprang to her feet, and by the time that
I had turned round all that was left of her was a slim shadow, fleeing in horror across
the lawn.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I saw her later that night, looking very pale, and drifting about in corners. I tried to
talk to her, feeling that perhaps I ought to apologize &#8212; though why one Buchmanite should
apologize to another Buchmanite for carrying the principle of 'absolute honesty' to its
logical conclusion, I really do not know. But she shot away, like a frightened deer,
and among her friends there was a great pursing of lips and darting of eyes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So much for one man's attempt to tell the truth, which really was not so very awful, between
ourselves. It was an illuminating experience. It is not to be recommended, either for the
comfort of the individual or for the peace of the world.<br>

A very disturbing feature of those &quot;Five C's&quot;
is the belief that it is okay to deceive the prospective new
member in order to get his confidence and confession, and get
him to join the group.

The recruiting member, who is called
a &quot;Soul Surgeon,&quot; should twist the truth, mask details,
tell half-truths, present only facts which will appeal to the prospect,
and &quot;confess&quot; or &quot;share&quot; stories &#8212; true or
untrue &#8212; telling how Buchmanism saved the recruiter from misery &#8212; 
basically, say <i>anything</i> &#8212; in order to entice the prospect to
join the Group.
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's all okay,&quot;</font> they said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;because
it is all done in the service of God.&quot;</font>

Beverly Nichols was, for a while, an enthusiastic member of the British
Oxford Groups. He was deceived and converted by Oxford Group recruiters who wanted to
use him for publicity purposes &#8212; they knew that he was a London newspaper
reporter, journalist, and writer, and they wanted to get some good press.
And their scheme worked. Besides giving them favorable newspaper coverage,
Beverly Nichols also inserted an enthusiastic chapter
of praise of the Oxford Groups into his current work in progress &#8212; a
book of religious philosophy titled <i>The Fool Hath Said</i>.
Naturally, that book became a favorite of the Oxford Groups.
But Nichols gradually became disillusioned with the Oxford Groups.
He suffered a nervous breakdown and left the Groups, and much later
wrote a letter to Tom Driberg telling of his experiences with the Groups:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I cannot remember the precise date of my first contact with them; I am
almost certain that it was in the year 1936. However, I do recall that it
came about as the result of an extremely private conversation,
in the course of which
I poured out my heart to one of its members, whom I prefer
to leave anonymous. Like many of us, I was in a pretty distracted
state at the time, because of the increasing danger
of war.
This is not merely a personal meandering, it is apposite to
the story. After all, I was the author of <i>Cry Havoc!</i>, which,
as you may recall, was a passionate plea for unadulterated
pacifism. I was prepared to go to any lengths to prevent
war, even maybe to blind myself to the essential evil in the
figure of Hitler. Anyway, as a result of this conversation I
attended my first meeting, and was so deeply impressed that I wrote
an article about it in the <i>Sunday Chronicle</i>. A long telegram
from Frank Buchman, congratulating me, arrived on the following
morning. Odd as it may seem, I had not run into him at the meeting;
indeed, I only met him once in my life, when I found him
strangely antipathetic. After that, for the next few weeks &#8212; or
was it months? &#8212; members of the Group were constantly calling
and ringing up and writing letters, and I am bound to admit that
by and large they were kind and helpful. They were aware of the
tensions through which I was passing, because, at my very first
meeting, I had got up and confessed that part of my hatred of war
was based on simple personal physical cowardice. It was not a very
sensational confession, and I hope you know me well enough to realise
that this was not the sole reason for my pacifism.
But though these young men did their best, I was not greatly
impressed by their mental calibre. One of them, I remember, was
quite shocked when I suggested that it might be a good idea if
there was some moral rearmament in the actual armament industry itself:
in the vast firm of Schneider-Creuzot, in Krupp's, and, of course,
in our own Vickers. In <i>Cry Havoc!</i> I had stressed the appalling
fact that there were secret agreements between these great firms
of which the ultimate outcome must be war. For the weapons of war were
their trade. But no member of the Oxford Group, as far as I am aware, ever thought
it worth while to call on the Merchants of Death, a phrase of my own
which was later attached to a best-seller in America.<br>
<a name="original_sponsor"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Somewhere around June, 1936, I was at the end of my tether, and I suddenly
decided to motor up to Oxford to see if these kindly people could give
me any personal assistance. And there I had a most bitter experience.
For
<font color="#9F0000">
my original sponsor</font>,
assuming that I was now irrevocably 'one of them', blandly informed
me that
<font color="blue">
the first meeting which I had ever attended had been 'staged'
entirely for my benefit</font>.
They had a shrewd idea of what was wrong
with me, and how I could best be 'got at', and so
<font color="blue">
all those first confessions had been rigged. In other words, they had put on
an act for my especial benefit</font>, hoping that I would give them good
publicity, as of course I did. Perhaps there was nothing so
reprehensible about this precedure, but the effect on myself at the
time was devastating.
<font color="blue">
It seemed to me to go completely counter to
their first fundamental principle of Absolute Honesty.
</font>
Feeling as I
did, I decided to be absolutely honest myself, and I got up on to the
platform in order to tell them how I felt about it.
But I could not speak, and I left the platform with the tears
streaming down my face. I left the hall by a side door, and
went out to sit in my car. Nobody followed me. It was about two o'clock
in the afternoon, and I stayed in the car for about half an hour,
trying to pull myself together. The next ten hours were a complete
blank, but shortly after midnight my servant returned to my small house
in Hampstead, to find me standing in the hall, staring at nothing
and saying 'I can't stop crying.' ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This little episode marked the beginning of a total nervous breakdown.<br>

</font>

<p>
<a name="Beverly_Nichols_breakdown2"> </a>
Beverly Nichols also described his experiences with the Oxford Groups in his later
book, <i>All I Could Never Be</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Ever since my return from Palestine I had been tortured by insomnia. &nbsp; ...
&nbsp; After a week or so of this you neither feel nor look very pretty.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was in this sort of state that I had come to Oxford; I thought that perhaps
the Group might help me. &nbsp;...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But the first meeting of the Group was quite dreadful. Dr. Buchman reminded me more
than ever of an American dentist, or rather, of a salesman of dental appliances
('use our special brushes and your teeth will last for ever'; 'use our special doctrine
and you'll gain eternity').<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
What happened after the meeting was even worse. For I said to my chief Grouper friend
 &#8212; one of Buchman's right-hand men: 'I do hope that when we meet again there will
be some &quot;witnesses&quot;, like last year &#8212; you know what I mean, people who will get up
and tell how their whole lives have been changed.'<br>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To which he replied, with a bright laugh: 'Oh, but those people you heard were our
star turns. We put them on specially for you.'<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Why this should have shocked me so much I do not know; the fact remains that it did.
I had thought that those men and women whom I had heard the year before were
speaking as the spirit moved them, almost as though they were 'speaking with
tongues'. Now it seemed that they had only been the high-spots in an evangelistic
vaudeville. Surely that was not 'absolute honesty', which was the first of the
four principles of the Group?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such was the question I asked myself, sitting in that dingy hotel, waiting till it was
time to go to the next meeting....<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But as I left the hotel to go to that last meeting I was in no mood of acceptance;
my nerves were strung so tightly that I felt like snarling at everybody.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The little hall was crowded with about two hundred people. There was a large percentage
of young women, and today they seemed to me strangely repulsive; they were both
repressed and complacent; their virginity was not a flaming militant purity, but
an asset to be smug about, like money in the savings bank. 'My virtue is still
intact' &#8212; 'My bank balance is still on the credit side'; one felt that they would
make those two statements in exactly the same tone of voice.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There was the same air about the young men. God forgive me if I were ever to sneer
at any man's effort to keep himself clean, but true purity is creative, it is a form
of shining self-expression; it has, indeed, a quality of passion about it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Here there was no radiance &#8212; one had rather the sense that the young men were
trying out purity as they might try out a new sort of pill, and the results were
sadly unbecoming... unbecoming in the most obvious physical sense. These young
men were ugly. They were pale and spotty and twitchy, and the palms of their hands
were wet. Their hair was untidy. Their whole appearance lacked lustre.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Except Dr. Buchman himself. There he was on the platform, and <i>he</i> was lustrous
enough. His pink cheeks sparkled; his spectacles glittered; his protuberant cuffs
were dazzling white; his dark blue trousers were beautifully creased; and his shoes
were bright as mirrors. &nbsp; ...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I sat down at the back and stared around me. All the members of the audience had
little notebooks in which they were busily scribbling their 'guidance'.
One or two of the young women, recognizing me, handed me their notebooks for
my autograph, giggling as they did so. In a sort of dream I signed them &#8212; 
and I remember that as I signed the last one I wrote my name just below the
pencilled phrase 'Stop <i>Sunday Express</i> and take in the <i>Observer</i>.'
So God was guiding the journalistic tastes of His followers too! I had an urge
to scribble underneath: 'But don't believe a word of the dramatic criticisms of
either of them.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And then the voice of Dr. Buchman:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Shall we have a few moments' Quiet?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Instantly the scribblings and the whisperings ceased. The eyes of Dr. Buchman closed
behind their sparkling glasses. The eyes of many others closed. Mine remained open,
and in them the tears began to gather. I head the birds singing outside, I
knew that there were roses in bloom and green lawns and a river running; but
how far away they seemed! I was a prisoner. I was in a lunatic asylum. I had gone
mad, stark, staring mad. All these people were mad too. It would not matter if only
I weren't so tired &#8212; so unutterably tired, because then I could escape.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once more, I managed to pull myself together.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was for the last time.<br>
<p>
<a name="changed"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The nasal twang of Dr. Buchman broke the silence.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He called for 'witnesses'.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A smartly dressed woman rose to her feet. She began, in a thin, sugary voice.
'I have been having a great deal of trouble with my maid. It seemed to me that she
was lazy and didn't look after my clothes properly. And that worried me because
nowadays I suppose no woman can have quite as many clothes as she wants.'
(Polite laughter.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Then the Group came into my life and I was &quot;changed&quot;, and I found I hadn't been
really honest with her. I had told her, for instance, that I had bought two black
dresses because I wanted them for mourning, whereas I really only wanted them because
they were becoming to me. So we started &quot;sharing&quot;, and she told me that once when
I was away, she had worn my clothes (which I had always suspected), and I told her
I was jealous because her figure was better than mine, and now we're the <i>greatest</i>
of friends. I think it only shows how God works in us if we will only <i>allow</i>
Him to.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
She sat down. There was applause. Dr. Buchman beamed. 'That is a fine thought,'
he said (pronouncing 'thought' as though it were spelt 'thot').
'God works in us if we will only allow Him to! Make a note of it, friends.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At this injunction there was much scribbling in the notebooks.
During the scribbling a young man had risen to his feet. In an exaggerated
Oxford drawl he observed:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'It came to me the other day, when I was reading a book on the early history
of electricity, that God is using the Oxford Group to release the spiritual forces
of the twentieth century just as He used the scientists to release the electrical
forces of the eighteenth.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This pompous and highly questionable statement elicited much applause. We were
all told to write it down. The young man was asked by Dr. Buchman, if any equally
impressive 'thots' had come to him, but God, apparently, had felt that He had
given him enough for one day, so no more were forthcoming.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But a great deal else was forthcoming. Young women who had been cross at breakfast,
but had now been 'changed', and were cross no longer.
Business men who had drunk port in the afternoon to the detriment of not only
their souls but their business. Now they were 'changed', the port was a thing
of the past and trade was booming.
Authors (unpublished), and artists (unhung), whose work had deepened and
broadened beyond recognition, though not apparently to the extent of selling.
Pettiness after pettiness, folly after folly &#8212; suddenly the whole thing was
unbearable to me. I could stomach it no longer.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
If I had been in a normal condition I should have begun to laugh uproariously.
As it was, I was in the first agonizing stages of a nervous breakdown, and I
began to cry. I cried, silently, but I knew that at any moment I should be
sobbing out loud.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
With the tears streaming down my face, I staggered to my feet, stumbled over
a number of astonished people, and somehow or other got out of the room.
Nobody followed me.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... &nbsp; How I drove that car to London must always remain a mystery.
Some queer automatic mechanism of the brain must have guided the wheel and
used the brakes. (On the following morning the car was discovered undamaged,
with its lights on, in a side-street about two miles from Hampstead Heath.
Presumably the automaton which was then in control of me had some reason for
leaving it there.)<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When I 'came to' it must have been nearly midnight, and I was standing under
a bright light in the little hall of the house in Hampstead, staring at the
front door, waiting for it to open.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At last there were steps outside. The door opened, and I saw the cheerful face
of Gaskin. He stared at me as if he had seen a ghost.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'Whatever has happened, sir?'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
'I can't stop crying, Gaskin.'<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nor could I. It was useless to try to sleep, with those great sobs tearing me
to pieces. I spent the night roaming the Heath on the arm of a friend, trying
to walk myself into a stupor. But the sobs would not stop. When the doctor
came in the morning it was quite impossible to tell him what was the matter.
He murmured, 'Acute nervous exhaustion', rang up a nursing home and booked a
room. An hour or two later a specialist was jabbing me in the knee and
shining bright lights into my eyes. I heard the gentle voice of a nurse.
'Just roll up your sleeve,' she said. There was the sting of ether on my arm.
'It won't hurt &#8212; just a prick.' A few moments later I went to sleep, and for
three days and nights I was out of the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is popularly supposed that nervous breakdowns are a luxury for the idle rich.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Oxford Group taught me otherwise.<br>

Ken Ragge, in his book <i>More Revealed</i>, stated:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The extraction of Confession was considered of ultimate importance and
great effort was made to get it.
<p>
<blockquote>
<i>When he is certain that the need for confession exists, the soul surgeon
must be lovingly relentless in insisting that the confession be made...
</i>(18)
</blockquote>
<p>
This &quot;loving relentlessness&quot; takes on a rather sinister
air when the
group's &quot;hospital work&quot; is considered. An alcoholic patient,
locked away
in a hospital, would be given only a Bible to read and was allowed only
Groupers for visitors during the &quot;Oxfordizing&quot; period.*
The poor victim
was under steady pressure, perhaps for days, weeks, or months, to accept
Oxford Group interpretations of the Bible and Oxford Group's will as God's
will. Even outside of hospitals, the grouper's techniques sometimes led
to severe emotional damage including nervous and mental breakdowns.(19)<br>

<a name="lists"> </a>
You will notice that Frank Buchman just loved lists of
&quot;principles&quot; or &quot;procedures&quot; or step-like things.
Frank had:
<ul>
<li> The Four Absolutes,
<li> The Five C's,
<li> The Five Procedures of the Sane,
<li> The Six Basic Assumptions,
<li> and The Six or Seven &quot;Principles&quot; or &quot;Practices of the Sane&quot;.
</ul>
<p>
The Twelve Steps and The Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous
are just another couple of iterations of the same old list-making routine.<br>
<p>
<font color="blue">
(But note that Buchman never exactly called them &quot;Steps&quot; &#8212; 
although Sam Shoemaker talked about
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-rroot120.html#next_step" target="_blank">taking the next step</a>&quot;</i>.
&quot;Steps&quot; was more Bill Wilson's terminology.
When Earl T. wrote in his <i>Big Book</i> story,
<i>He Sold Himself Short</i>,
that the early A.A.'s were using a 6-step program
<font size="-1">
[on page 292 of the 3rd edition, and on page 263 of the 4th edition]</font>,
that was a slight misnomer.
It was Buchman's 6-step program all right, but Buchman called it
something more like &quot;the six principles&quot; or
&quot;The Six Practices of the Sane&quot;.)
</font>
<p>
The Five Procedures included:
<ol>
<li> giving in to God,
<li> listening to God's directions,
<li> checking guidance,
<li> making restitution, and
<li> sharing one's sins openly.
</ol>

<p>
The Six Basic Assumptions were that
<ol>
<li> men were sinners,
<li> men can be &quot;changed&quot;,
<li> confession is necessary to &quot;change&quot;,
<li> the &quot;changed&quot; person has direct access to God,
<li> the age of miracles has returned,
<li> and those who have been fortunate enough to
be &quot;changed&quot; should seek to &quot;change&quot; others.<br>
(Those who had been converted to Buchman's beliefs were called
<i>&quot;the changed&quot;</i>, and those who proselytized and recruited
for the Oxford Groups were called <i>&quot;life changers&quot;</i> or
<i>&quot;Soul Surgeons&quot;</i>.)
</ol>


<p>
The Oxford Group manual <a href="soulsurgery.pdf"><i>Soul Surgery</i></a>
<font size="-1">(page 4)</font> lists
&quot;The Principles Of Personal Evangelism&quot; (&quot;the Five C's&quot;) as:
<ol>
<li> Confidence &#8212;  Get the trust and confidence of the targeted victim.
<li> Confession &#8212;  Confess something to the victim, and get him to confess something about himself in return.
<li> Conviction &#8212;  Turn the victim's confession back upon him and amplify and exaggerate it and make him convict himself of all kinds of sins.
<li> Conversion &#8212;  Offer religious conversion as the only way out of the guilt.
<li> Conservation &#8212;  Send the new convert out to get other victims by using these same practices on them.
</ol>

As a matter of fact, we can very easily translate the Twelve Steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous <i>backwards</i> into Buchmanite so-called
&quot;principles&quot; or &quot;procedures&quot;, by changing
the word &quot;alcohol&quot; to &quot;sin&quot;, like this:
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<p>
<ul>
<li> 1) We admitted that we had been defeated by sin, and were powerless over it.<br>
<li> 2) We came to believe that only God could restore us to sanity.<br>
<li> 3) We surrendered our wills and our lives to the control of God.<br>
<li> 4) We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br>
<li> 5) We confessed our sins to another person and to God.<br>
<li> 6) and 7) We humbly, on our knees, begged God to remove our sins.<br>
<li> 8) We made of list of persons we had harmed.<br>
<li> 9) We made direct amends to them.<br>
<li> 10) Repeat steps 1 through 9 endlessly, and constantly declare that we are wrong.<br>
<li> 11) We prayed for Guidance and the power to do God's Will.<br>
<li> 12) We recruited more members by carrying the message to those
who were still defeated by sin,
and also swore to practice these principles in all of our affairs.<br>
</ul>
</font>
<p>
<a name="six_practices"> </a>
Notice the similarity between those steps, and the practices
of the Oxford Group &#8212; <i>&quot;the Six Practices of the Sane&quot;</i>:
<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
1) Admission of personal defeat by sin.<br>
2) Taking of personal inventory.<br>
3) Confession of one's sins to another person.<br>
4) Making restitution to those one has harmed.<br>
5) Helping others selflessly [<i>going recruiting for the cult</i>].<br>
6) Praying to God for Guidance and the power to put these precepts into practice.<br>
</font>

<p>
Also, the A.A. steps 2, 3, and 11 are covered by the Buchmanism
concept of &quot;Guidance&quot;. The
adherent is supposed to surrender to Guidance, which is the same
thing as surrendering to God,
which is the same thing as surrendering to God-control, which,
according to Buchmanism, will restore one to &quot;sanity&quot;.
<p>
And A.A. Step 12 is the same as Buchmanism's
&quot;Conservation&quot; or &quot;Continuance&quot;,
which means <i>&quot;go recruit more members.&quot;</i> It is also
the same as Buchman's earlier seventh
principle, &quot;carrying the message&quot; to
those &quot;still defeated by sin.&quot;
And it is also the same thing as the Sixth Basic Assumption:
&quot;Those who have been fortunate enough to be 'changed'
should seek to 'change' others.&quot;
And it is the same as the &quot;Fifth C&quot;.
And recruiting is also strongly implied in Buchman's practice 5 here &#8212; 
&quot;Helping others selflessly&quot; really means working hard
to convert everybody else to Buchmanism so that they, too, can
go to Heaven.
