<font color="blue">
This is a report that was posted to the Internet, describing a speech
given by Harvard Professor George Vaillant, who is one of the non-alcoholic Trustees of
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.
<p>
The original text is black, and my comments are blue.
</font>
<p>
<br>
<p>Subject: Dr Stephen Jurd's report from Professor Vaillant's talk in Boston.
<br>
<p>Standing Ovation For Harvard Professor.
<br>
<p>I have never heard an audience clap as long, loudly and spontaneously as at
the Boston Park Plaza Hotel where the Harvard Medical School's Department
of Continuing Education had its 23rd Annual Addictions Course on March 3rd
and 4th. Professor George Vaillant, he of &quot;The Wisdom of the Ego&quot; and &quot;The
Natural History of Alcoholism&quot; presented an enthralling paper entitled
&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Magic Bullet&quot;.
<br><font color="blue">
Just watching politicians do their acts proves that quite a variety
of pompous liars can get a crowd of fools clapping for them. That alone is
no great accomplishment.
</font><br>
<p>
<a href="penicillin"> </a>
He said that AA is &quot;more like penicillin than the Moonies&quot;. He reiterated
the theme outlined in <i>The Natural History of Alcoholism</i> by stating that
there are four factors associated with sustained recovery from addictions:
<br>
(i)  Compulsory supervision
<br><font color="blue">
This is total bull. Many more people recover
on their own</a>, without A.A.,
than with A.A., by a factor of five.
(And that isn't just my opinion;
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School
says so.</a>)
The recovering addicts <b>do not</b> have any compulsory supervision in their
lives, to help them to, or force them to, stay sober.
So fascist discipline is not necessary for recovery from alcoholism or drug addictions.
<p>
And A.A. is not at all like penicillin.  Penicillin actually works. A.A. doesn't.
Penicillin works <i>at least</i> 95% of the time, while
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">A.A. with its 12 steps fails
<i>at least</i> 95% of the time</a>.
</font><br>
<p>

(ii) Substitute dependence
<br>
<font color="blue">
This is some more bull. Transferring an addiction from a chemical
to A.A. is not an improvement. It is a horrible development.
Becoming truly free of addictions is the desired goal, not a lifetime
of emotionally-crippled dependency. And addiction to a
<a href="orange-cult.html">cult religion</a> is even worse.
</font>
<br>
<p>

(iii) New love relationships
<br>
<font color="blue">
This is a really sick joke. Few new &quot;love relationships&quot; develop
in those meetings. In fact, new members are explicitly told, repeatedly,
<br>
<i>&quot;Do not get into any new relationships for the first year!&quot;</i>
<br>
Some new friendships may or may not develop. All too often,
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred">shallow or exploitative
relationships</a> develop.
<p>
Read Rebecca Fransway's book,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#horror_stories"><i>AA Horror Stories</i></a>,
before jumping to any conclusions. She documents far too many tales of
exploitation and <i>unloving</i> relationships.  And A.A. sponsors who
are neurotic manipulative personalities, sexual predators, and rapists.
<br></font>
<p>

and (iv) Increased spirituality and religiosity.
<br><font color="blue">
Teaching people to yammer &quot;Higher Power&quot; is not
necessarily an increase in &quot;spirituality and religiosity.&quot;
I <i>*really*</i> want to hear how Prof. Vaillant measures this parameter.

<p>
What shall we do to measure increased &quot;spirituality and religiosity&quot;?
Obviously, we will need something far more sophisticated than just
counting how may times per hour people parrot buzz-words like:
<i>
<ul>
<li>  &quot;spiritual&quot;,
<li>  &quot;powerless&quot;,
<li>  &quot;God&quot;,
<li>  &quot;sanity&quot;,
<li>  &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
<li>  &quot;my God is H.P.&quot;,
<li>  &quot;surrender&quot;,
<li>  &quot;defects of character&quot;,
<li>  &quot;confess&quot;,
<li>  &quot;miracle&quot;,
<li>  &quot;group&quot;,
<li>  &quot;as we understood Him&quot;.
</ul>
</i>
So, if we don't just count buzz-words, just what <i>are</i> we going to measure?
<p>
Besides which, who proved that getting an increase in so-called &quot;spirituality and religiosity&quot;
is necessarily a good thing? Very evil cults do the same thing too... Just ask
Jim Jones, David Koresh, and Marshall Herff Applewhite. (The People's Temple cult at Jonestown,
the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas, and the Heaven's Gate cult in San Diego.)
<p>
Increased superstition is a bad thing.
Teaching people to depend on an imaginary Fairy Godmother or other
vague, undefined &quot;Higher Power&quot; to solve all of
their problems, instead of depending on themselves and realistically working
on their problems, is a very bad thing. It encourages people to be delusional
and mentally ill, rather than sane and realistic.

<br></font>
<p>

He then went on to explain how AA embodies each of these factors.
<p>
Firstly, AA provides an external conscience by the regular contact with
fellow members encouraging abstinence and personal growth.
<br>
<font color="blue">
Here, we actually agree on something.  The moral support of a group can be a good thing.
But there is no &quot;external conscience&quot; to
replace a &quot;broken&quot; inner conscience. It's just group pressure
urging successful abstinence. Note that you can get this same group support from
any rational recovery group, like SOS, SMART, WFS, or even just your own circle of dry friends.
</font>
<p>

Secondly, AA
understands bad habits need substitutes and so gives new members rigorous
and time consuming programs of action.
<br>
<font color="blue">
Giving someone a substitute addiction is not &quot;personal growth&quot;,
any more than switching someone from an illegal heroin habit to a
legal alcohol habit is personal growth.
An A.A. 12-step meeting addiction is itself a bad habit.
Wasting people's time with &quot;time-consuming programs of action&quot;
that accomplish nothing is not &quot;personal growth.&quot; A <b>far better</b>
use of people's time would be to tell them the whole truth about everything and teach them
techniques for coping with cravings.
</font>
<p>

Thirdly AA provides new, mutually
caring relationships, uncomplicated by alcoholism induced guilt, social or
financial debt.
<br>
<font color="blue">
This might or
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred">might not happen</a>. You might find a friend, or you might
find a neurotic self-centered loser, or a control freak, or a sexual predator.
Again, read Rebecca Fransway's book, <i>AA Horror Stories</i>.
Or check out
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred">my short list of problems</a>.
Or check out
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the Midtown Group</a> for sponsors raping under-age girls.
</font><p>


Fourthly, the 12 steps are spiritual, and recovering alcoholics need atonement.
<p><font color="blue">
The 12 steps are no more spiritual than the teachings of any other cult.
After all, the 12 steps are just
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">Frank Buchman's cult religion</a>, rehashed.
Try Reverend Jim Jones and his
<i>&quot;Drink More Cyanide Kool-Aid!&quot;</i> <b>Last Step Program</b> for
some really <b>&quot;spiritual&quot;</b> cult teachings
that will have you talking to God in no time.
<p>
<p>
Even if it were a religion, A.A. cannot offer atonement for sins, can it?
An individual atones for his sins by doing penance or making amends, or both.
That individual can atone just as easily without A.A.,
or any other church, for that matter.
</font><p>

Vaillant reminded all of the guilt relieving
properties of alcohol by saying &quot;Only God can be as forgiving as gin.&quot;
<br><font color="blue">
Thank you, Prof. Vaillant. Now it is blatantly obvious that you are giving us
your religious beliefs, not any medical or scientific facts about alcoholism.
</font><p>
<p>
He went on with consummate subtlety to link the spirituality of AA to their
often acknowledged use of the group itself as a &quot;Higher Power&quot;, which in
turn he linked to Jung's notion of humanity linked in common spirituality,
which in turn he linked to Marx's idea of religion being the &quot;opiate of the
masses&quot;, which in turn he linked to the effect of opiates on the brain and
the way they effect deeper brain structures, inaccessible to logic,
willpower, psychoanalysis or CBT. (He reminded us that  &quot;Alligators don't
come when they're called.&quot;) Thus he contended that AA's spirituality
affects those parts of the reptilian brain otherwise inaccessible to
treatment.

<p><font color="blue">
This is quite a load of bull...<br>
No matter how much he used &quot;consummate subtlety&quot;
to link together a bunch of unrelated things, declaring that A.A. cult religiosity
(&quot;spirituality&quot;)
works on the opiate receptors in the
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#stupidbrain">reptilian brain</a>
is just such total bull that it is hard to believe
that he can say it out loud with a straight face, never mind
actually believe what he is saying. Is this Professor Vaillant another lunatic, or what?
This sounds far too much like the ravings of Bill Wilson and Dr. Harry Tiebout,
two other A.A. heroes who
found that real facts and rigorous honesty were unnecessary bothers.
<p>
Since Prof. Vaillant passes himself off as a scientist, perhaps the good professor
would like to show us some genuine scientific research,
some real experiments with controls,
that show how A.A.'s bombastic religiosity works on the human brain?
I'll bet that there is no such research, so Prof. Vaillant is just blowing
hot air.
<p>
<a name="beta_endorphins"> </a>
Plus, I'm surprised that a Harvard Professor cannot tell the difference between
the opiate receptors in the brain, and the dopamine receptors. The opiate receptors
are activated by beta endorphins and opiates like opium, morphine, codein, and heroin,
and <i>nothing else.</i> That is the body's pain-killer system.
The dopamine receptors are triggered by L-dopamine,
the production of which can be triggered by a wider variety
of stimuli, some of them very non-drug-oriented,
like the feeling of satisfaction that comes from a job well done,
or the satisfaction that comes from sex. The dopamine system is
the body's pleasure system.
Why do I seem to know more about the functioning of the human brain
than Professor Vaillant,
when I don't even have a degree in the subject? What's his problem? And why is
he lecturing so far out of his field of expertise that he doesn't even seem to know
what he is talking about?
<p>

</font><p>

<p>He told us that AA works.
<br><font color="blue">
That comes as no surprise. That has always been Prof. Vaillant's
<i><b>opinion</b></i> and <i><b>wish</b></i>,
since <b>even before</b> he
ever tried using 12-step therapy on his patients. Really do read his book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism,</i> where he clearly
described, on pages 283 and 284, how <i><b>excited</b></i> he
was to start using the new 12-step therapy on patients.
His enthusiasm for A.A. and Twelve Step therapy was only
slightly dampened by his discovery that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">it didn't work</a>:

<p> 
<font color="black">
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
To me, alcoholism became a fascinating disease.
It seemed perfectly clear that ...
by turning to recovering alcoholics
[A.A. members] rather than to Ph.D.'s for lessons in breaking
self-detrimental and more or less involuntary habits, and by inexorably
moving patients from dependence upon the general hospital into the
treatment system of A.A., I was working for
the most exciting alcohol program in the world.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But then came the rub.
Fueled by our enthusiasm, I and the director, William Clark, tried to
prove our efficacy. ...<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...
After initial discharge, only five
patients in the Clinic sample <i>never</i> relapsed to alcoholic drinking,
and there is compelling evidence that the results of our treatment were
no better than the natural history of the disease.
...<br>
Not only had we failed to alter the natural history of alcoholism,
but our death rate of three percent a year was appalling.<br>
</font>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<b>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</b>, George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1983, pages 283-285.<br>
The same text was reprinted in Vaillant's later book,
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism <b>Revisited</b></i>,
George E. Vaillant, Harvard University Press, Cambridge,
MA, 1995, pages 349-352.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>
Still, Vaillant really <i>wishes</i> that A.A. worked, so he goes around
saying that it works.
<br>
Still, Vaillant is really in love with the Alcoholics Anonymous cult
religion, so he still insists that all alcoholics must get sent to
it, even if it doesn't help them with their alcoholism, even if it kills them.
</font>
<p>

Emrich's recent review showed that attendance at
AA meetings, having an AA sponsor and doing the 12 steps all correlated
with good outcome in several studies. Project MATCH showed some superiority
of Twelve Step Facilitation over CBT at 3 year follow up.
<br>
<font color="blue">
<!--
Emrick's &quot;review&quot; was bogus. He just picked a few poorly-done studies
that gave results that he liked, while ignoring all results to the contrary.
<P>
-->
Project MATCH was one of the most screwed-up &quot;research&quot; projects
that the government ever funded.

<b>There were no controls.</b> The subjects were biased, were cherry-picked,
and were told what results were expected and desired.
Then, when it was over, the researchers deliberately misinterpreted the results
to claim that the research showed that treatment works.
The only thing that Project MATCH proved is that some fools can waste
$25 Million.
<p>
And Prof. Vaillant knows that. He cannot not know it. There has been far too
much loud public debate on Project MATCH, including the retraction and reinterpretation
of the results when critics pointed out the flaws after the first public
release of the results. So Prof. Vaillant is blatantly deceiving
the crowd at this point. He must know what the real truth is, and he isn't
telling it.
</font><p>

<a name="MM"> </a>
And Bill Miller, once an important protagonist of controlled drinking, found at 8 year
follow up that most of his good outcome patients, selected as aspirant
controlled drinkers, had achieved abstinence through AA. The founder of
&quot;Moderation Management&quot; is now an AA member!
<br><font color="blue">
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Vaillant. Few A.A. boosters will admit that
Audrey Kishline, the founder of &quot;Moderation Management&quot;,
went back to being an A.A. member. They won't admit
it, because after three months of A.A. &quot;help&quot; and &quot;therapy&quot;,
she relapsed, went on a huge binge, drove drunk, and killed two people in
a crash. Now she is going to prison for manslaughter. She was a hell of a lot better
off before she got the help of A.A. and the Twelve Steps.
<p>
But what the heck, <i>Keep Coming Back, It Works!</i>
</font><p>

<p>Lastly he told us why AA is not a cult:
<br>
(i) The strict outlines of recovery
AA style are solely to produce liberty and longevity. All components of AA
are voluntary.
<br><font color="blue">
Voluntary?
<ol>
<li>Ever heard of court-ordered attendance?
<li>Ever heard of &quot;Go to the meetings, or you will be violating your probation.&quot;
<li>Ever heard, &quot;Work the Steps, or Die!&quot;
<li>Ever heard of &quot;This treatment facility uses 12-step therapy.
 Go to 3 meetings per week, or even better, one per day, or get kicked out of the program.&quot;
</ol>
<br>
The &quot;strict outlines&quot; produce
a substitute addiction, not recovery. Didn't Prof. Vaillant just brag about the
new substitute dependency up above? A new dependency, a new addiction, is not liberty.
</font><p>

(ii) No AA member has power over another one.
<br><font color="blue">
Oh?
<ul>
<li> Ever heard of a sponsor? Ever heard, &quot;Do what your sponsor says,
or you will relapse and die drunk.&quot;?
<li> Ever heard, &quot;Do what your sponsor says, or he will tell your parole officer&quot;?

<li> Ever heard of &quot;You must surrender your will and your life to your Higher Power,
and your Higher Power can be the A.A. group&quot;?
The <i>Big Book</i> contains explicit instructions to
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#surrender">surrender to the group</a>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Since I gave my will over to A.A., whatever A.A. has wanted of me
I've tried to do to the best of my ability.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 340.</font>
</blockquote>
</ul>
</font><p>


(iii) AA members are not separated from the rest of the community &#8212; you can be
shunned in one AA meeting and comfortable in another &#8212; the old AA saying is
that &quot;All it takes for a new meeting is a resentment and a coffee pot.&quot;
<br><font color="blue">
This is a bogus distinction.
When you are in a meeting, you are in A.A., not
in &quot;the rest of the community.&quot;
When your sponsor is having you do the Twelve Steps, you are in A.A., not
in &quot;the rest of the community.&quot;
A cult does not have to buy a farm and set up a compound with armed guards
and barbed wire to be separated from the rest of the community.
Only the most extreme cults practice total physical isolation of cult
members from the rest of the community.
</font><p>

(iv) AA recruits by attraction not promotion.
<br><font color="blue">
Baloney. T.V. advertising, compulsory A.A. attendance for
&quot;therapy program&quot; patients,
&quot;90 Meetings or 90 days in jail&quot; for drunk drivers,
and &quot;Get a sponsor&quot; for parolees
are not &quot;a program of attraction,&quot; they are promotion and even coercion.
See
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting">the cult test</a>
for a description of the numerous aggressive recruiting and self-promotion
strategies of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font><p>

(v) The Twelve Traditions are an important preventive measure to cult like behaviour.
<br><font color="blue">
More bull. They are part of the problem.
<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad1">Tradition One</a>
says that no one can break A.A. unity, so conformity and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#uniformTraditions">uniform group-think
and cult-speak</a> are the order of the day.
<br>
And Tradition Eleven says that A.A. is supposed to be a program
of attraction, not promotion, but we just dealt with that issue.
</font><p>

(vi) AA has a sense of humour. They keep in mind Rule 62: &quot;Don't
take yourself too seriously.&quot;
<br><font color="blue">
Again, more total bull.
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#humor">They have no humor whatsoever</a>.
They pretend to have lots of humor, by laughing and joking about everything
and anything except those things that are really important, like
Bill Wilson's insane ravings, the crazy A.A. dogma, or the nasty cult characteristics
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. encourages members to tell jokes about themselves and their friends,
to reinforce the idea that A.A. members are all foolish and stupid and
need the supervision of a sponsor, but A.A. forbids criticism or
ridicule of A.A. itself.
<p>
Those true believers who think that they have a sense of humor should
go read <a href="orange-jokes.html">my recovery jokes</a> and then
report back how funny they find the jokes and how much they laughed...

I really want to hear about the results.
(What I do hear is that they go ballistic and have a hissy-fit.)
</font><p>

<br><font color="blue">
Those six characteristics of a cult that Vaillant just listed are hardly a
complete list of cult characteristics. They aren't even &quot;sort of&quot; a good
list. I have 100 items on my list of standard cult characteristics, and A.A.
scores an 'A' as a cult when rated on them.
<a href="orange-cult.html">Check them out.</a>
</font><p>

It was a wonderful experience just to be in an audience so warmly
appreciative of such a major intellect and contributor to our field.
