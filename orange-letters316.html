Hi Orange,

<p>
Notice the attached documents.  These two letters were in the library archive online.  Note that Bill W. is writing Dr. Bob about money.  It's perfectly clear that he is using hundreds (thousands) of dollars that belong to the struggling Alcoholic Foundation for personal use like his mortgage, etc.  He also suggest that Dr. Bob participate in the thievery as well.

<p>
Another interesting point is the discussion about Dr. Bob's &quot;sickness&quot; and Bill's suggestion that he get away from the AA groups and stay with him for a while.  This was well before the cancer and I'm wonder if he wanted Bob to come dry out?

<p>
I thought that you could use this in your research.  I think that this being in your possession would allow for more people to see it.

<p>
I hope you are well and enjoying retirement.  Take care!

<p>
~Avo

Hi Orange,

<p>
There are a few juicy letters in the library archive.  The one attached, for example, is from Bill W. to &quot;Gerig&quot;.  Notice how Bill thanks him for the &quot;thoughtful gift&quot; which appears to be acceptance of money for offering him/her a &quot;happy recovery&quot;.  The insidious thief also claims that it was a struggle to accept it.

<p>
My Best,<br>

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello Avo,
<p>
Thank you very much. I love to get historical documents like that. They are undeniable evidence.

<p>
Like you said, the first letter is a real eye-opener:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The question we raise is this &#8212; why do you come to Bedford Hills for three days when you should come
for three weeks or three months?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now it is possible that Bill Wilson was just being friendly, and wanting Dr. Bob to stay for a long visit,
but on the other hand, it sure does sound like a detoxing session, doesn't it?
<p>
The rest of the first letter, talking about how Bill Wilson made trips around the country to
cajole new groups to &quot;support the Vesey Street office&quot;, is revealing.
<p>
At the same time, Bill Wilson was taking a &quot;swipe&quot; at the back royalties that were owed to Dr. Bob,
asking him to sign over $300 that Dr. Bob desperately needed, was outrageous.
And sign it over to Lois? Why Lois?  What kind of money laundering was that?
Was Bill Wilson trying to cover up his chicanery?

<p>
And then Bill was planning to take another $500 out of the book receipts two months later, and Bill would get
either $300 or $500 of it, depending on whether Dr. Bob had cashed his $200 check.
So, either way, by late October, Dr. Bob got $500, and Bill Wilson got $1000.
Bill Wilson sure did have his hand in the cookie jar, didn't he?

<p>
By the way, those were 1941 dollars. Multiply those numbers by 14 or 15 to get an idea of what that
much money would be worth now. (One handy inflation calculator is
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005119/http://www.westegg.com/inflation/" target="_blank">http://www.westegg.com/inflation/</a>.)
<p>
Of course, neither Bill Wilson nor Dr. Bob was entitled to a penny in royalties.
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="_blank">The original agreement &#8212; the stock prospectus</a>
&#8212; said that Bill Wilson would get $1000 for writing the opening chapters of
the <i>Big Book</i>, and the copyright would belong to <b>The 100 Men Corporation</b>,
and the royalties would go to the Alcoholic Foundation.

<p>
But Bill managed to rearrange that to his own advantage, didn't he?
&#8212; Like by
<a href="orange-bigbook.html" target="_blank">stealing the copyright</a>,
and registering the book in his own name, claiming that he was the sole author, and that he
owned a sole proprietorship publishing company called &quot;Works Publishing&quot;.
Which means that the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i> is invalid, and always has been.
<p>
Then Bill Wilson cut Dr. Bob in on the stolen money.
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith" target="_blank">Dr. Bob's daughter, Sue Smith Windows, said</a>
that Dr. Bob urged the other A.A. members not to make a fuss about Bill Wilson's dishonesty,
&quot;for the good of the fellowship.&quot; Oh yeh.

<p>
I also noticed that Bill Wilson mentioned the <i>World-Telegram</i> newspaper
article twice, and had high hopes for it increasing the membership and sales of
the <i>Big Book</i>. A program of &quot;attraction, not promotion&quot;, huh?
Yeh, right.

<p>
What is curious there is that Bill Wilson was hoping that his New York group would increase in size to
that of Cleveland. What? Do you mean that Clarence Snyder over in Cleveland
was a better A.A. recruiter than Bill Wilson?
&#8212; The Clarence Snyder who was really one of the co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous
&#8212;  and he even invented the &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; name
&#8212;  but he got none of the credit, and the A.A. headquarters staff even 
purged Clarence Snyder's story from the fourth edition of the <i>Big Book</i> because
Snyder dared to criticize Saint Bill Wilson's financial dishonesty.
Clarence Snyder is now an A.A. &quot;non-person&quot;.
Ah, Stalin-like rewrites of history. Isn't it wonderful?

<p>
Then Bill Wilson ended the letter by talking about Dr. Bob's health:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We wish you would tell us what there is to these reports we get about your health.
I don't like them a bit. And if they are true why in heaven's name don't you come down here
for a good long stay with us? We are pretty well insulated from the A.A. at Bedford Hills when we
want to be. Opinion is unanimous out your way that you are going to get damn sick unless you let up.
I beg of you Bob to drop that situation out there for as long as necessary.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now that is very odd. It sounds like Bill Wilson was saying that A.A. activities were destroying Dr. Bob's
health. How could that be? What is so damaging about going to A.A. meetings, or going to the hospital and
recruiting new members? Why did Dr. Bob have to get away from &quot;that situation&quot;?
What situation was that?

<p>
And notice how Bill Wilson said that he was &quot;insulated from the A.A. at Bedford Hills&quot;.
Oh really? The founder shuns A.A. meetings?
What was the point of that? Why was that an advantage for Dr. Bob's health?

<p>
And how could living with Bill Wilson for a year improve Dr. Bob's health? What
disease could Bill Wilson treat?  After all, Dr. Bob was the doctor, not Bill Wilson.
Strange, very strange.

<p>
The guess that maybe Dr. Bob was surreptitiously drinking, and Bill Wilson wanted to sober him up, again,
is a reasonable one. What other, better, explanation is there?
I cannot think of any other reason why living with Bill Wilson for three months or a year would improve
Dr. Bob's health.

<p>
Yes, a very interesting letter. Thank you.

</font></font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>



<p>
Now the second letter, to &quot;Gerig&quot;:
Yes, Bill Wilson was taking gifts and contributions. No doubt about it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Every now and then someone sends me such a remembrance and each time I'm a little puzzled what
to do with the funds.
Money in connection with &quot;AA&quot; has always been a delicate subject.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh what a load of bull. Bill Wilson had no problem spending money on his expensive house in the country,
or his Cadillac car, or his mistresses.
<font color="#9F0000">
<i>&quot;Gee, I'm puzzled about what to do with the funds. I'm so embarrassed to have so much money in my hands.&quot;</i>
</font>
Yeh, right.

<p>
By the way,
<a href="orange-letters261.html#Ray_S" target="_blank">&quot;the farm that we have for AAs down here&quot;</a>
was actually owned by Bill Wilson.
So he was really suggesting donating $25 to his own property while making it sound like he was generously
supporting a charity project for detoxing alcoholics.

<p>
Likewise, donating the money to &quot;The Alcoholic Foundation&quot; sounds unselfish, until you remember that
&quot;supporting Bill Wilson in the style to which he would like to become accustomed&quot; was
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html" target="_blank">the biggest &quot;office expense&quot; of the Alcoholic Foundation</a>.

<p>
Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.

<p>
Thanks again for the documents.  And have a good day now.

Hello Pamela,
<p>
Actually, I really like my resentments and I plan to keep them.
<p>
I have resentments against all kinds of creeps, like
<p>
<ol>

<li> Fake healers who foist quackery on sick people and lie to them about how well it works.

<li> Phony holy men who lie to seekers in the name of God.

<li> Sexual predators who exploit under-age girls.

<li> Cult leaders who exploit and mislead people who are trying to improve their lives.

<li> Politicians who lie us into unnecessary wars.
<li> Wall Street criminals who make billions by stealing Grandma's house.
<li> Corrupt Congressmen who give the national treasury to the Wall Street criminals.

</ol>
<p>
Such resentments are a good thing and give me the energy to get something done.

<p>
You should get yourself some of those resentments, just to keep your resentment against me company.
<p>
Have a good day now.

From: 	&quot;A_White.&quot;<br>
Subject: 	I feel for you...<br>

<p>
It sure is funny that all which you tout as true here is as pertinent to your own
attack on AA. This publicized attack is littered with half truths and ignorance. and
a heaping helping of hatred. The latter is as plain easy to see as is the Sun in a
morning sky, or the stars on a clear night.

<p>
I've hated before. Hated people estabilishments and life inm tgeneral for decades. I'm
quite doubtful I've ever hated anything as vehemently as you do AA. Maybe. No. I
haven't. I've kept my resentments to myself.

<p>
Establishing a website dedicated to erode confidence in AA, and further, to place a
bar in front of it, no. I've not hated anyone that much. Of that I'm sure, and I
held one hatred for 43 years. I've even hated God! And told Him so!

<p>
Just as a 5 year old who wants something their parent (s) wont' or can't give them
and they say in their own misery, &quot;I hate you!&quot; as the result. Do you think Mom &amp; or
Dad kicks them to the curb for voicing their anger? Or thereafter, sends them off to
play outside  and while they're gone, changes the locks on the doors? No. They
forgive them for it as they are just children. I think God has a far greater
capacity for love then do human beings.

<p>
I thought you should know of, or at least have a shot at seeing a different face of
AA than the one you espouse so publicly and so incorrectly. That heading of your's
from the Bigger Big Book, is exactly what you, yourself have accomplished with this
web site. You have created an atrocity.

<p>
You've woven many of your own vipers around some selfserving half truths.

<p>
As you can always spot an alcoholic but are unable to tell (convince) them of most
anything, so it goes with alcoholics. It's also why it is so important that ANY and
EVERY alcoholic make that particular call of being an alcoholic, for themselves.
Like you, they won't believe anyone else.

<p>
When a person is ordered to jump from a burning building onto a safety net as the
only way to save their lives, and they do not, exactly whose fault is it then?
Ultimately, accountability and responsibility is the individuals sole province.
Placing blame thereafter is only a game for those who do not or can not be honest
about the situation at hand.

<p>
The oddest part about that is this. the overwhelming majority of alkies already know
if they are drunks or not. They merely refuse to admit it to themselves deep down.
That's called acceptance. That.is the ONLY way a psychic change can begin to
materialize within one's mind.  It's that way with religion too. Everrything begins
in the brain. All changes start there. No matter the scheme, theology, ideology, or
conviction, all begin exactly the same way, in our thoughts.

<p>
Do I want to be a Prodestant, Pentacostal, Methodist, or Moslem? Unlike Judism, we
have the choice as it isn't our birthright to be claimed by it/them.

<p>
As with this ludicrous effort you've spent enormous energy on, your errant
disgraceful bent towards AA began in your own mind first. Via prejudices, fear, or
merely the need to blame someone for something, that's how you gave this vengeful
derogatory, and misleading tale of yours life. By having a deep seated resentment
and then being it's tip of the spear.

<p>
Killing a person is easy enough to do. Killing an idea? Well, good luck with that
one sport. It's sheer folly. Only dysfunctional or diminished prospects will align
themselves with such wrongful edicts.

<p>
Hurt people hurt people. In their own disgust and maybe a good bit of self pity for
motivation, they blindly jab and swing out trying to inflict as much hurt as they
feel towards othere's or towards the crux of their own ire yet without any tangible
relief coming back towards their own affairs. Peace will never be theirs.

<p>
It's revolting. Bashedly, shameful. Not to mention a huge waste of time and energy.

<p>
You have filter in a few out of context facts or simple details along the way and
allow them to serve your purpose by adding falsehoods to accompany them. You've
built a house of cards here and indeed may well be killing people along the way by
so doing.

<p>
I'm alive today and sober these 13 years as the direct result of a loving God which
in fact AA enabled me to reacquaint myself with. Which God you and I serve are
easily different Gods, that is plain enough.

<p>
Someday you and I shall meet as all mankind will when we are judged for what we have
wrought in our lives. I pray by then you will have foumnd your way and it will begin
as with all things do, within your own mind. If you allow it to take root you very
well may find acceptance and with the ability to accept, and a modicum of honesty,
you might just find forgiveness. Live and let live is one tenant of AA.  it's quite
a good one too. One you haven't yet fitted into your quiver. Your arrows all possess
the stench of rancor, anger, fear, and hatred, and the aroma of unforgiveness. That
too is evident.

<p>
.but then isn't  compassion and forgiveness spiritual tenants as well? Even
religious ones? I didn't see where you quoted Bill W. as directing AA's towards
implementing  religious traits and tendencies into their own quiver for finding
their way to God again. He did you know. Trust me, it's in the AA text book in black
and white.

<p>
I wonder too if God keeps us accountable for those lives we destroy which we don't
even know? Never have met? Haven't even seen personally?  I hope for your sake He
Does not.

<p>
your web site, if it isn't immediately killing folks, it sure isn't aiding their
journey to find Him.

<p>
See that's the thing about hatred. People despise it when it is openly displayed,
even if and when they themselves are filled with it. It's distasteful. Offputting.
It smacks of evil doing. Consequently, the hateful devotee who casts the slings and
arrows of abhorrence towards this or that, often gets despised and has the aroma of
incredulity. That is of course to those with any degree of intelligence at all. The
purveyor of mistruths &amp; half truths IS SEEN AS LITTLE MORE THAN SOME IDIOT ON A HATE
FILLED RANT!

<p>
I pray more and more see you for what you are. someone who is blinded by their own
rage and or the possibility that whatever axe they have to grind with some path for
recovery they could not abide, or were not willing to follow, is an axe of
worthlessness, and self inflicted suffering. That it comes from a person who is
quite incapable of forgiveness.

<p>
I'd not be so quick to be judging a program by it's fellowship. Not any more, that
is. There is a difference, I've known people in church which I don't feel are living
the doctrines and dogma they say they subscribe too. should I then discount and rail
the Church itself? That would be ridiculous. Foolish. I'd be stupid to make a viable
program or process so accountable.

<p>
<a name="about_God"> </a>
There are a number of paths to God. AA is just one more. In fact, from one source of
over 40 years of quality sobriety I've heard him say, &quot;AA is all about God.&quot; The Co
founder of AA, Dr Bob S. was quoted as saying &quot;if you boil AA down to it's most
basic components, it is all about Love, and Service.&quot;

<p>
AA has never failed anyone. but people, as people will, do fail AA. Do not look
unfavorably upon any people, culture, race, religion, or politic because of the acts
of a few or the one. To do this is to , exhibit one's own ignorance, and if evil
lives anywhere on Earth, it lives in our ignorance and those things I know which
simply are not so.

<p>
I'll say this and close, as you enjoy posting chapter and verse from the Bible, have
you ever read or heard this verse? &quot;

<p>
Our Father, Who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy name... forgive us our trespasses,
&quot;AS WE FORGIVE those who trespass aginst us.. &quot;

<p>
I ask God for forgiveness, equal to the forgiveness I give to other people, places,
and things for having harmed me. it's always going to be the people actually. Only
they can do harm to me. Their program, their devotions, their Church, or their
subscription to a suggested path for rehabilitation can not TOUCH me.

<p>
Aren't acts of vengeance God's own province? Always check the motive behind the
motive friend, there always is one hiding back there. It takes fearlessness and
honesty to find it however. I can disguise or ignore it altogether, but it ever
remains the true one. This veil of your's is so easy to see, and how pitiful it
really is. I feel sorry for you.

<p>
Find some Forgiveness, it's a  bonafide step towards finding peace. If you do not,
you seal your own fate with God. Isn't that what it's all about anyhow? Being free.
Having peace &amp; contentment. Helping others.

<p>
These are what AA has taught me thru the years as the right things to do.

<p>
If God speaks to us, it is in the language of the heart, and love is the only
universal language that I know. Aren't we supposed to love our neighbor as ourself?
Turn the other cheek? Forgive them as we want to be forgiven? Let it gho man. It's
just wrong.

<p>
Be well,

<font color="blue">
Hello A. White,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Alas, what is missing from that letter is any actual facts
like, &quot;What is the real A.A. cure rate? How many lives does 
A.A. really save, as opposed to how many people does A.A. miseducate about alcohol abuse?&quot;

<p>
That is what matters. Your opinion of my writings has absolutely nothing to do with the A.A. success rate.
So how many live, and how many die in A.A.?

<p>
Then, to comment on just a few of your statements:

<p>
<ol>


<p><li>
What you call &quot;having hatred&quot; is not necessarily a bad thing, just
 like how &quot;having a resentment&quot; against evil things
is not necessarily bad.


<p><li>
&quot;Placing a bar&quot; before A.A. is not a bad thing, when you consider how many people A.A. harms with misinformation
and cultish guilt induction.


<p><li>
This is one of the standard A.A. put-downs of alcoholics:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;As you can always spot an alcoholic but are unable to tell (convince) them of most
anything, so it goes with alcoholics.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
A.A. claims that it wants to &quot;reduce the stigma of alcoholism&quot;, but they actually work to increase it
by constantly harping on how bad alcoholics really are. See the file
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy</a> for
much more on that.

<p><li>
This is a dodge:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When a person is ordered to jump from a burning building onto a safety net as the
only way to save their lives, and they do not, exactly whose fault is it then?
Ultimately, accountability and responsibility is the individuals sole province.
Placing blame thereafter is only a game for those who do not or can not be honest
about the situation at hand.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You are assuming that A.A. is not foisting quackery on sick people.
The net that firemen hold out is a real help. The cult religion that A.A. members hold out is
something completely different.
A.A. does not offer a safety net; it offers
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Dr. Frank Buchman's old pro-Nazi cult religion</a>
from the nineteen-thirties.

<p>
Of course sobriety is ultimately an individual person's choice &#8212; especially since the A.A.
teachings about being &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; are untrue. That is why A.A. does not deserve the
credit for the few people who chose to quit drinking while attending A.A. meetings.
The individual people do it themselves.
 
<p><li>
This is another A.A. stereotype of &quot;the alcoholic&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The oddest part about that is this. the overwhelming majority of alkies already know
if they are drunks or not. They merely refuse to admit it to themselves deep down.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, A.A. is saying that alcoholics are dishonest and unrealistic. That is not necessarily true.
Alcoholics are not all alike. I, for instance, knew I was an alcoholic and said so. I was not &quot;in denial&quot;.
I just drank too much to kill the pain from how sick I was.

Quoting things in the <i>Big Book</i> or other &quot;council-approved&quot; literature
is not &quot;quoting out of context&quot;.
<p>
To quote out of context is taking just bits and pieces of something in a manner that <i><b>changes the meaning of the

pages so that there is no confusion about what the text is saying.

<p>
So you think that the A.A. God is waiting on you hand and foot and saving your life while he
ignores millions of sick and starving children on the other side of the planet?
Can you explain how you rate so highly in God's list of priorities?

<p>
Yes, and how about <i>not</i> foisting lies and quackery on sick people? How about really helping
them to get better? How about giving them something better than cult religion, so that they
can really live? A.A. does not do that.

<p>
Bill Wilson said all kinds of things. He was on both sides of most all important issues.
On the one hand he said that you had to &quot;find God&quot;, and on the other hand he said that you

And you know that I quoted all of that stuff. You complained about me &quot;taking it out of context&quot;.

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives" target="_blank">Shifting objectives:

<p>
That is the standard A.A. trick of &quot;the real A.A.&quot;. When I point out the
faults of the A.A. program or organization, they argue,
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;That isn't the real A.A. The real A.A. is something else.&quot;
</font>

<p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<p><li>
First, the real A.A. is what Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob created. They are considered
the Saints of A.A., and their teachings are allegedly <i>The Message From God</i>.
A.A. members reverently read <i>As Bill Sees It</i> out loud at meetings.
<p><li>
But then, when you point out
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">what sick insane men Bill Wilson
and Dr. Bob really were</a>,
the A.A. promoters claim that the A.A. program is the 12 Steps and the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out what insane Buchmanite nonsense is in <i>the Book</i>,
and how
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">
the 12 Steps are really just the cult practices of Dr. Frank Buchman</a>,
then the &quot;real A.A.&quot; is <i>The Fellowship</i>.
<p><li>
When you point out how many
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">con artists, psychopaths</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">rapists</a>
make up the Fellowship, they claim that the real A.A. is the
corporation whose headquarters is in the Interchurch Center in New York City.

<p><li> Then, when you point out
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">what crimes that corporation has been committing lately</a>,
the A.A. true believers insist that the real A.A. is the teachings of Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob.
</ul>
<p>
Baloney. It's all really A.A.
<p>
</blockquote>


Now you are arguing that the &quot;real A.A.&quot; is &quot;the program&quot;, not the creeps
 who make up &quot;the fellowship&quot;.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Well, when a young woman goes to A.A. and has a criminal trying to get into her pants, rather than
help her to live clean and sober, that is the real A.A. for her.

<p>
<li>
And when a crazy sponsor tells a sick person not to take his doctor-prescribed medications and
a psychotic breakdown results, that is the real A.A. for him.
<p>
<li>
And when people get fed cult religion rather than any real help in quitting addictions, that is the real
A.A. for them.
</ul>


<p><li>
Then there is this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There are a number of paths to God. AA is just one more. In fact, from one source of
over 40 years of quality sobriety I've heard him say, &quot;AA is all about God.&quot; The Co
founder of AA, Dr Bob S. was quoted as saying &quot;if you boil AA down to it's most
basic components, it is all about Love, and Service.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are two things wrong with that. First off, A.A. was supposed to be a quit-drinking program,
not a religion. It's that bait-and-switch trick again.

<p>
Secondly, A.A. is not a path to God. More like a path to Satan. A.A. resembles selling your soul to the
Devil in trade for sobriety, what with promising to
<a href="orange-recruit.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">deceive the newcomers to get them to join</a>,
and constantly parroting lies, and claiming that you 
can worship any Golden Calf or stone idol or &quot;group of drunks&quot; as your &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
<p>
A.A. is grossly heretical and unChristian. I wrote a whole file on that:
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">The Heresy of the Twelve Steps</a>.

<p><li>
This slogan is so grossly unrealistic that it is delusional:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
AA has never failed anyone. but people, as people will, do fail AA.

</blockquote>
<p>
Thanks for the proof that A.A. really is a cult.

<p><li>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;AS WE FORGIVE those who trespass aginst us.. &quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
What do you do about a criminal who won't quit committing his crimes and hurting people?
Do you just &quot;forgive him&quot; and let him keep on doing it, year after year after year after year?
<p>
Well, A.A. won't quit hurting and deceiving people.

<p><li>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</blockquote>
<p>
Who is talking about vengeance? Do you see me sending out assassination squads to kill A.A. leaders?
<p>
Telling the truth about what some frauds and con artists are doing is not &quot;vengeance&quot;.

<p><li>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
What you really mean is,
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;Please quit telling the truth about Alcoholics Anonymous. Please just be quiet
and go away and let us continue to deceive people.&quot;
</font>

<p>
I really like the little threat and fear-mongering in there:
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;God will get mad at you for criticizing
Alcoholics Anonymous and not forgiving them for hurting sick people. You are sealing your own fate.&quot;

Would it be accurate to describe Al-Anon, NA, AA, ACOA, AlAteen etc. as
different franchises of the same 12-step cult religion, targeted at
different demographic groups?

<p>
Tom,<br>
Ireland

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Tom,
<p>
Hmmm. Interesting question. I guess it depends on what we mean by &quot;franchise&quot;.
Legally, most franchises are licensed by the parent corporation, and the franchisee
must obey certain rules and conform to a certain style to &quot;preserve the brand&quot;.
McDonalds burger joints, for example, must all look exactly alike and all serve the
same things, even though they are actually owned by different people.

<p>
That does sound like the various 12-step groups, except that they are not licensed by
the parent corporation Alcoholics Anonymous.  Legally, they are all different corporations
that subscribe to and promote the same 12-Step religion. (Except for Alateen, which is owned by Al-Anon.)

<p>
Even though they are legally separate corporations, there is obviously a tacit agreement
among them that they will all sell the same 12-Step &quot;spirituality&quot;, and they won't change
the religious dogma in any way.
<p>
That makes them more like franchisees than like independent churches. I am often reminded of
the myriad Protestant churches who all sell their own flavor of Protestant Christianity,
which often differs from the neighboring Protestant church's flavor by only one tiny little bit of dogma,
like whether they sprinkle or dunk during baptism, or use real wine or grape juice for communion.
In that sense, the various 12-Step organizations are closer to franchises than to independent churches.
The 12-Step franchisees are not allowed to make up their own theology, not even a little bit.
They all look to <i>Fearless Leader</i> in the Interchurch Building in New York City for their inspiration
and the official party line.

<p>
Interesting question. My answer is, &quot;I'm going to go feed the geese.&quot;
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I was directed to your site through a Google search.  I think I could spend
a year reviewing what you have posted and not scratch the surface and all
of the topics I scanned were of interest to me.

<p>
The reason I am writing, however, is to ask that you remove a document from
your site.

<p>
The search query that led me to your site was a friends first and last name
and it pulled up
<a href="orange-letters273.html#iamnotastatistic" target="_blank">minutes from Area 33s June 19, 2011 Assembly</a>.
These
minutes included first and last names, phone numbers and addresses and
clearly identifies the people listed as members of Alcoholics
Anonymous. This is in opposition of our traditions regarding anonymity.

<p>
Your assistance will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you,<br>
--<br>
Fred C.<br>
Delegate, Panel 61<br>
Area 33, Southeast Michigan<br>

Hello Fred,
<p>
Actually, it is not an issue of &quot;anonymity&quot;. If A.A. really practiced anonymity, there would be
no last names in the document. Rather, what you are really practicing is merely secrecy, where you don't
want outsiders to know names, or know who is doing what.
<p>
A.A. gave up on anonymity a long time ago. We all know the full names of lots of A.A. members ranging from

<a href="orange-letters62.html#Mel_Gibson" target="_blank">Mel Gibson</a>
to
<a href="orange-letters79.html#Conner" target="_blank">Tara Conner</a>
to
<a href="orange-letters228.html#West_Wing" target="_blank">Aaron Sorkin</a>
to
<a href="orange-letters107.html#Gary_B" target="_blank">Gary Busey</a>
to
<a href="orange-letters227.html#Martin_Sheen" target="_blank">Martin Sheen</a>.
<p>
And we all know when Mel Gibson or Tara Conner or Lindsay Lohan is going back into rehab again.
<p>
And then there are the sub-cult leaders like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Mike Quinones</a>
and
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">Clancy Imusland</a>.
<p>
And then there are famous A.A. authors like Mel Barger going on TV on <i>The History Detectives</i>, using
his full name while he spouted A.A. mythology and misinformation.

<p>
The A.A. &quot;tradition of anonymity&quot; is not a tradition at all. It's just a policy of partial secrecy.

<p>
I would edit out the last names in that document if I could, just to be nice.
Unfortunately, it is in PDF format and no editor that I have can edit it.
<p>
That document is too important and revealing to delete.
What makes that document so important is the issue of crazy fantical dogmatic oldtimers telling
sick people in treatment centers to not follow their doctors' orders, and to not take their medications.
That is beyond outrageous.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
TREATMENT:  Neal K.:  The Committee meets quarterly at Sylvan Lake Lutheran Church
in West Bloomfield, 2399 Figa.  The Committee has received a few complaints, from
various Treatment Facilities.  The panels going in for the Bridging the Gap Program
have been giving advice to patients, in contradiction with what their attending
physician has recommended.  These problems were addressed and the coordinators for
the facility were contacted and advised of the situation.  The Committee decided
to send a letter to all facilities participating in the Bridging the Gap Program
stating that if problems arise, to contact the Corrections Committee.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is not dealing with the problem, or fixing it.
Just telling the doctors and facilities to complain to the &quot;Corrections Committee&quot; is a non-answer to the problem.
That is basically just giving the doctors the run-around routine.
<p>
Why didn't you tell the crazy fanatics who were contradicting the doctors' orders that they were
no longer allowed to visit treatment centers as part of the &quot;Bridging the Gap Program&quot;? After all, they
were committing a crime in the name of Alcoholics Anonymous, practicing medicine without a license,
and endangering the lives of the patients. Why don't you really solve the problem by stopping it?
Permanently.
<p>
Why is it that any criminal can do anything to anybody in Alcoholics Anonymous, and there are no repercussions?
Rapists can rape the newcomer young women, con artists can rob the cloudy-headed beginners,
unscrupulous sponsors can make themselves slave-masters, and religious fanatics can tell
shaky newcomers not to take their medications, and nothing ever happens to correct the problem,
and the offenders are never punished.
Why do you &quot;unconditionally love&quot; the criminals, but not their victims?

<p>
There will be some big lawsuits some day, after one too many A.A. nutcases kills one too many sick newcomers with
bad medical advice and quackery.  Would you like to see all A.A. assets wiped out by a multi-million-dollar lawsuit?
You should really deal with the problem before it's too late.
<p>
Never mind actually being concerned about the welfare of the patients whom A.A. is supposed to be helping.
Why should you do that?

<p>
Such quackery is one of the reasons why I say that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. kills more people than it saves</a>.
And they do.
<p>
Now, about the document. If you want to send me an edited version, where the last names have been abbreviated,
and that is <b>the only change to the document</b>, then I will post that document as a replacement for the current
document. Like I said, I don't have an editor that can edit PDF files.

<p>
Have a good day now.

BLOG NOTE: Sunday, 2012.07.15:
<br>
The Redwing Blackbird was outrageous today. I have regular feeding spots where I put out rolled oats
for the birds. I put out piles of oats in the same places day after day because the birds
learn where those places are, and know where to go to find food.
There is one spot on the eastern pond where the Redwing Blackbirds have learned the spot
and actually fly to me when I arrive. They know me and my routine, and they know why I'm there, so
they sit in the nearby tree or bushes and squawk while I dole out the
oats. Well today, one little guy had to nerve to demand that I leave as soon as I had put out a pile
of oats. He actually flew around me squawking and complaining. He was happy with me putting out the
oats, but as soon as I had, he wanted me gone so that he could eat in peace.
I tried to get a picture of him when he landed on the
ground just a dozen feet from me, but he jumped behind weeds and hid whenever I pointed a camera at
him. How's that for gratitude? I feed him, and he won't even pose for a picture. He just
demands that I leave.
&quot;Munchies, yes. Photographers, no. Go away.&quot;
