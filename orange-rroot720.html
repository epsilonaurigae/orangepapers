Most people have never heard of Frank Buchman or The Oxford Group or
Moral Re-Armament, that they know of. But they might remember one thing:
a squeaky-clean song-and-dance show called &quot;<i>Sing Out!</i>&quot; or
&quot;<i>Up With People!</i>&quot;. That show was the product of several surviving members
of MRA, particularly five members of the Board of Directors
of Moral Re-Armament, Inc.:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#Blanton_Belk">J. Blanton Belk</a>,
the Executive National Director of Moral Re-Armament
<li>
William Van Dusen Wishard,  who was the Director of
<i>Up With People</i>,
<li>
William F. Wilkes, the financier and fund raiser,
<li>
James E. MacLennon, who traveled with the casts.
<li>
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#Dr_Morris_Martin_1">Dr. Morris Martin</a>
(Frank Buchman's former personal secretary),
who created the academic program in 1969, and traveled with
the show as a full-time teacher until 1973.
</ul>

<p>
They offered the <i>Sing Out!</i> and
<i>Up With People!</i> shows as a &quot;moral&quot;
alternative to the anti-war Hippies of the 'sixties and 'seventies,
and as a jingoistic denunciation of the opposition to the War in Viet Nam:

Something young, something fresh, something defiant has erupted onto the modern
scene. A new heartbeat has quickened the pulse of the age. A new
generation has risen to shoulder the tasks of world rebuilding.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is not a fresh innovation of the tousle-topped sex-mongers and groaners,
not a new wiggle, a new twist, not a new thrill, not the rainbow world of LSD
or a fast, fast, fast, form of escape.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is the newly discovered thrill of the very opposite of these.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is a rebirth, a reversal of a trend, a dramatic turn across the traffic patterns
of an age.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus, while thousands were crying, &quot;Down with war! Down with patiotism!&quot; a new voice
of a generation was heard crying &quot;Up With People.&quot;<br>

the same thing as saying &quot;Down with patriotism&quot;.]</i>

That show, like the previous MRA theatrical productions, featured lots
of mindless fluff and singing and dancing and jingoistic flag-waving, done
by beautiful young people who were so well-shorn and properly dressed that
they were ready for employment at Disneyland or on the Lawrence Welk show.
The show even featured a satirical skit where the &quot;patriotic youth&quot;
chased some scuzzy guitar-playing hippie Vietnam War protestors off of the stage.
The militarists loved it.

The &quot;<i>Sing Out!</i>&quot; show was produced under the auspices of Moral
Re-Armament, but that became a problem when corporate sponsors like
General Electric did not wish to be publicly associated with such a
weird fascist cult religion, so the producers renamed the show to
&quot;<i>Up With People!</i>&quot;, and hid any links to Moral Re-Armament.
(But they didn't hide them very well. The authors of the MRA propaganda book
<i>Moral Re-Armament: What Is It?</i> bragged about producing both shows,
and they often used the two names interchangeably. So did the book
<i>Born To Upturn The World: The people who are making the Sing-Out explosion,
&quot;Up With People&quot;</i>, by David Allen.)

<p>
The show's producers still managed to put their moral stamp on it: On
the bus, young men and women were not allowed to sit together, for
reasons of &quot;purity.&quot; The young men were given lectures, advising
against hot showers, lest the warm water arouse them to abuse themselves.

Dr. Buchman carefully trains his followers to carry out
his technique of revivalism. Several of the rules seem to
have been made for the express purpose of side-tracking
intelligent inquiry, the displacing of intellectual honesty
by subversive emotional appeal and, above all the muffling-down
of criticism. Two of his precepts are: &quot;Avoid argument&quot;

The <i>Sing Out!</i> and <i>Up With People!</i> shows were pure
Moral Re-Armament propaganda, and their publications
said as much. The following account of a cast meeting, as told
by Moral Re-Armament, sounds very much like
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#this_fellowship">just another Buchmanite
&quot;house party&quot;</a>, with all of the talk about
&quot;this fellowship&quot;, and &quot;this way of life&quot;, and giving
your entire life to the cult, and how &quot;mere existence&quot; is
meaningless and purposeless outside of a cult religion:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... <i>Up With People</i> is built on bedrock. Its foundations
are driven into the granite of an unshakeable
faith. Its cornerstone is the burning, almost competitive spirit
to live straighter lives than any men have dared to live.
The girders of its structure are
<font color="blue">
four standards,
Honesty. Purity. Unselfishness. Love. The architectural
requirements are absolute.</font>
The plan accepted by everyone in
the cast is that of a Master Mind, a Divine Spirit which, for
all of them, will be their lives' guiding standard.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A spark of frankness leaps from one to another in their
conversations. Purposeful and young in heart,
the people in <i>Up With People</i> are a new breed,
bolder, more outspoken than any around them.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Before the show starts, the secret may be found.
For half an hour, or sometimes three-quarters of an hour,
the cast meets. Traditionally known as a &quot;green-room&quot;
through the history of the theater, this cast meeting is
like none other in America.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Before tonight's show, for instance, the cast met outside.
Some were sitting on boxes, others on benches, some on the
ground, a few standing. They talked over the recent days
and discussed earnestly their plans for the future now that they
were back in America.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
John Parker was leading it. After a while he asked them all to
say what was most on their minds.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A young college student from Orlando, Florida was first on his feet.
&quot;You know, the first time I ran into Sing-Out it was like a new breeze.
I had no purpose in life.
<font color="blue">Merely existing is no way to live a full life.</font>
It takes a certain purpose to live by &#8212; and sticking to that purpose.
<font color="blue">
I frankly have made up my mind to go with you people for life.</font>&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A boy from Wyoming was next.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I guess most of you know that I am a pilot. I have flown since I was quite
young and I love to fly.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I had a choice this summer; either to go back to Wyoming and take over my
grandfather's airport &#8212; or to stick with you in the cast. You don't know
how set I was on going home. Flying is what I like to do most.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Last night I was watching the show from out front.
The song 'We are With You Mr. Washington' &#8212; I don't know &#8212; it hit me like
a bombshell. I was sitting there with tears in my eyes.
<font color="blue">
I suddenly felt I
have something an awful lot more important to do than fly.</font>
I have got
to do something for my country. I can't sit back and let things go wrong
in the world.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I guess I don't say things too well &#8212; but I want you all to know I'm
one of the happiest guys in the world to tell everybody that
<font color="blue">
I'm going to stay for as long as it takes.</font>&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A Negro girl from Harlem stood up. &quot;Yesterday I was home for a day. I
got the shock of my life.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I used to think there was nothing wrong with New York, in spite of all you
read in the papers about our city. But I got in a cab. The driver was very
abusive. I got on the subway. People on the subways are afraid to smile.
I went home. I found my friends had joined the Black Muslims and were
honestly convinced that the Negroes were going to rise and overthrow the
whites.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;<font color="blue">Suddenly I began to value the way of life we have found together in
Sing-Out.</font>
I asked God to give me the courage to live that one day so
dynamically that anyone, just by seeing me, would feel something of the
spirit of Moral Re-Armament.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I decided to get straight with my parents. It was the first time my
family had been under the same roof for &#8212; oh, I don't know how long.
I brought my brother into the room, too. I told them everything about
my life. My brother's mouth was hanging open.
<font color="blue">
I told them what I had
found in Moral Re-Armament.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Well, the result of it &#8212; I can't tell you quite how it happened &#8212;
but my mother and father decided to try to live together again.<br>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I want to thank Moral Re-Armament and every one of you for what you have
done for me and my family.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Another girl, an actress-model from a very different side of New York, spoke
up. &quot;I was sort of a mod on the fringe of the beat,&quot; she said. My family
split up when I was twelve and I got all closed up and bitter. I was
booted out of boarding school. I didn't believe in anything. Life was pretty
simple: fight for yourself and if you have to step on other people to get to
the top, it's just too bad.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;With you all
<font color="blue">
I've gotten a faith and something to live for bigger than myself.</font>
I even began to care about other people.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A blond high school senior from Alabama got to his feet. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I just want you to know that I am ready to play my part. I don't want to
give just one year to Moral Re-Armament. I want to go beyond that and
<font color="blue">
build
a whole new world and give the rest of my life.</font>&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A girl from Cincinnati put up her hand to speak.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;When I first saw <i>Up With People</i> in March I was just one sheep in
a 'nation of sheep' &#8212; you know, trying to be 'in' like everyone else.
I had wool in my eyes that I didn't want to remove.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot; Ever since I have joined <i>Up With People</i> I have been &#8212; I don't know &#8212;
I have been able to <i>see</i>. I love life so much more. Really, I have
learned so much about the world situation that I never even cared about
before. I have learned why problems exist. If you don't know the problems,
you sure can't find the cure for them.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;This has brought me so much closer to my family than I have ever been before.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="blue">
&quot;All I can say is 'down with sheep and up with people!'&quot;<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a name="wild"> </a>
The next girl to speak was daughter of an Air Force General and had just recently
joined the cast. &quot;<font color="blue">I know now that Moral Re-Armament is for life</font>
&#8212; not a show
you travel with for six months or a movement you admire.
It is principles you incorporate into your own life and it's got to be
brought to everyone.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
She went on, &quot;We military dependents are known as a wild and way-out crowd
right around the world. Instead, I think we ought to be
<font color="blue">

MRA didn't seem to know much about the military way of life.
According to MRA, a General's daughter said,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We military dependents are known as a wild and way-out crowd
right around the world...&quot;
</font>
That is not entirely true. (I know, I grew up in the military.)
There were a few bad-boy high-ranking officers' sons, but by and large,
the military dependents were very regimented.
A military man is held strictly accountable for what his children do, and if
his children get busted, then he gets busted too, which can be the end of his military career.
The least he is likely to get, if his children get into trouble,
is reduced in rank and pay. But that can also mean that he never gets another
promotion. His career is over.
The military attitude is, &quot;If you can't control your own children,
then how can we trust you to control troops in combat?&quot;
So military dependents are often some of the most oppressed, regimented,
and disciplined children on earth.
<p>
Again, we see the standard Oxford Group show routine of converts
telling exaggerated stories of their &quot;extremely sinful and wild ways&quot;
before Frank Buchman's wonderful recruiters led them to the straight and
narrow path.

An Indian girl, dressed in a beautiful costume of her pueblo in New Mexico, spoke quietly,
&quot;I used to hate anyone who wasn't an American Indian because of the injustices
done to my people in the past.
But I realized that the hate and bitterness which
ran my life are the same petty problems that are dividing races and nations today.

Speaking of the war in Vietnam, the <i>&quot;Up With People&quot;</i> propaganda book
<i>Born To Upturn The World</i> tells us about Peter Howard teaching young
people:

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As he [Bob Quesnel] came up to Howard he found him surrounded by people, plying him
with questions.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Would you say that your idea of North and South Vietnam being given a common idea
is related to co-existence?&quot;
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Howard smiled, &quot;I don't think that a field of cabbages can co-exist very long with
300 rabbits. I think it does take an idea to beat an idea. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
Why in the world should not the North Vietnamese be captured by our concept for
the world? Because we don't give it to them. The reason we don't give it to them
is because we don't have it.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;What kind of world are you trying to produce?&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Howard's eye darted to the young man who had asked the question, a college student.
&quot;A world living in full liberty and fulfillment because it is governed by
men governed by God, ruling people who look to God.&quot;<br>

One last interesting note:
<p>
Those young people in
&quot;<i>Up With People!</i>&quot; worked hard at singing,
dancing, and playing musical instruments. You would think that they
deserved to get paid for their work &#8212; they put on a large number
of shows all across the country each year, and sold a lot of
tickets, and even appeared on national television &#8212; NBC TV &#8212; in 1968,
as well as on hundreds of local stations in 32 cities.
<p>
Did they get paid for their work?
<p>
No.
<p>
Well, so they volunteered, and just got room and board while
they toured the country, right?
<p>
No, not even close.
<p>
<a name="ftnt121_ret"> </a>
They were actually expected to pay $9800 per year for the privilege of
working on stage for free. (Although it is reported that, in 1990,
about one-third of the cast did get some kind
of financial
aid.)<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt121">121</a></sup></font>

<p>
And the <a href="orange-propaganda.html#false_history">False Analysis Of History</a>
is another propaganda trick that MRA used there.
The early American colonists most assuredly did not give everything they had
to General George Washington and his army.
In fact, only one third of the colonists even supported
the revolution. Another third were loyal to the King and Crown, and the remainder sat on the
fence, undecided.
George Washington was constantly begging the Continental Congress for more supplies
because he never got enough.
If it weren't for the French, the revolutionaries would have starved and lost the war.
But MRA did not intend to educate people with accurate facts.... MRA just waved the flag
and suggested that people should give them all of their money to MRA if they were really
patriotic and really moral.
