Do You Think Too Much?

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It started out innocently enough. I began to think at parties now and
then to loosen up. Inevitably though, one thought led to another, and
soon I was more than just a social thinker.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I began to think alone &#8212; &quot;to relax,&quot; I told myself &#8212; but I knew it
wasn't true. Thinking became more and more important to me, and
finally I was thinking all the time.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I began to think on the job. I knew that thinking and employment
don't mix, but I couldn't stop myself.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I began to avoid friends at lunchtime so I could read Thoreau and
Kafka. I would return to the office dizzied and confused,
asking, &quot;What is it exactly we are doing here?&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Things weren't going so great at home either. One evening I had
turned off the TV and asked my wife about the meaning of life. She
spent that night at her mother's.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I soon had a reputation as a heavy thinker. One day the boss called
me in. He said, &quot;Skippy, I like you, and it hurts me to say this, but
your thinking has become a real problem. If you don't stop thinking
on the job, you'll have to find another job.&quot; This gave me a lot to
think about.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I came home early after my conversation with the boss. &quot;Honey,&quot; I
confessed, &quot;I've been thinking...&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I know you've been thinking,&quot; she said, &quot;and I want a divorce!&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;But Honey, surely it's not that serious.&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;It is serious,&quot; she said, lower lip aquiver. &quot;You think as much as
college professors, and college professors don't make any money, so
if you keep on thinking we won't have any money!&quot;

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;That's a faulty syllogism,&quot; I said impatiently, and she began to
cry. I'd had enough. &quot;I'm going to the library,&quot; I snarled as I
stomped out the door.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I headed for the library, in the mood for some Nietzsche, with a PBS
station on the radio. I roared into the parking lot and ran up to the
big glass doors... they didn't open. The library was closed.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
To this day, I believe that a Higher Power was looking out for me
that night.
As I sank to the ground clawing at the unfeeling glass, whimpering
for Zarathustra, a poster caught my eye. &quot;Friend, is heavy thinking
ruining your life?&quot; it asked. You probably recognize that line. It
comes from the standard Thinker's Anonymous poster.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Which is why I am what I am today: a recovering thinker. I never miss
a TA meeting. At each meeting we watch a non-educational video; last
week it was &quot;Porky's.&quot; Then we share experiences about how we avoided
thinking since the last meeting.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I still have my job, and things are a lot better at home. Life just
seemed... easier, somehow, as soon as I stopped thinking.
