Hello there,

<p>
Really love your site.

<p>
I have a couple of questions for you.

<p>
1.  My sponsor was texting me all the time and now (after telling her that the
aa writing was a bit much for me) she told me not to text her anymore. Only
to call. I thought this was a little strange to suddenly tell me to stop
texting. After months of texting going on. I have ptsd and it's hard for me
to talk over the phone...a lot of the time  I need to use text for that
reason. She told me she was getting &quot;lazy&quot; by using texts and not voice.

<p>
2.  I just got off the phone with my sponsor. She told me not to take valerian
root (which I use for anxiety), benedryl (for my severe allergies, or
anything of the sort. She said that if I continue to use those products...I
would relapse on alcohol.

<p>
Do you have any suggestions for this?

<p>
This all seems a bit off to me.

<p>
Thanks for reading my email. Can you please keep this anonymous..I am
afraid she may see this and know it is me.

<p>
Appreciate your time.

Hello Anonymous,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliment and the questions.

<p>
1. Your sponsor suddenly refusing to text to you sounds ridiculous.
If she was able to do it before, why not now?
There is no guarantee that your A.A. sponsor is even sane.

<p>
2. Telling you not to take medications is extremely bad. That is one of the worst aspects of
Alcoholics Anonymous (and all of the other 12-Step organizations too).
They kill a lot of people by telling them not to take medications.
<p>
Of course you should take your medications. The A.A. superstition that you won't be &quot;really sober&quot;,
or that you will relapse, if you take medications, is just an old A.A. superstition.
There is no truth to it. The A.A. sponsors who tell their sponsees not to take medications
are committing a crime  &#8212;  practicing medicine without a license.
They are also practicing medicine without any training. The A.A. sponsors never went to medical
school, or graduated, or did an internship, and yet they presume to be qualified to give out
medical advice. That is quackery, and it's against the law.

<p>
We have discussed and debated the &quot;no medications&quot; issue so many times that it is getting to
be incredible:

<p>
<ol>
<p><li>
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">The Hazelden Coffee War</a> is the
funny story of anti-medication fanatics at the Hazelden &quot;treatment center&quot;
who thought that coffee was too strong of a drug to allow to people in recovery.

<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#no_meds" target="_blank">Quacks who are selling 12-Step
&quot;recovery&quot;  &#8212;  even to non-alcoholics and non-addicts  &#8212;
routinely tell people not to take medications</a>.

<p><li>
There is a long discussion of the &quot;no meds&quot; issue in this letter, including a list of
previous stories:<br>

I finally went to a shrink, and he wanted to
put me on medication. I told my &quot;friend&quot; this, and he took me out to eat after a
meeting, with four other people, and they did an intervention. &quot;We'd really hate to
see you get drunk. You shouldn't take medicine, you won't be sober anymore, and
you'll drink very soon.&quot;</a>

At about the same time I was diagnosed
with Bipolar Disorder by a competent psychiatrist and I was treated
with the drugs available at that time, lithium and antidepressants.
As I was being treated for my bipolar disorder I mentioned this in

was chastised and told to not take those medications, God would heal
me.</a>

taking medication after MY sponsor called me out on my Prozac.... I was
shamed into stopping it. I was informed by her, and several other pseudo-aa

anti-depressants.</a>

Well, that's enough stories to get the gist of the debate.
<p>
<blockquote>

</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Again, anyone who tells you not to take medications is not only an unqualified, uneducated quack,
she is very dangerous to your health. She literally does not know what she is doing.
She is just parrotting slogans and repeating superstitions.

<p>
I would tell you to get a new sponsor, except that I don't think you even need a sponsor.
The sponsorship system itself has never been proven to help the sponsees. When sponsorship was tested
in controlled studies,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" target="_blank">it did not improve the sobriety
of the sponsees at all</a>.
<p>
Perhaps you might like one of the alternative recovery groups better. Here is the list,
in easily-printed format:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-alt_list.html</a>

<p>
Note that not all of those groups have face-to-face meetings in every city (although they are growing,
and establishing more meetings every year), but most of them
have online meetings and chat groups. So I guess you can even text to them.

<p>
Oh, and lastly, your fear that your sponsor will find out what you are writing indicates that
you have the wrong sponsor. If a counselor or therapist or mentor or spiritual advisor
is to be a real help, you should be able to be totally honest with that person.
Having to hide things from your sponsor is a dead give-away that something is wrong there.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

Subject:        Re: You should consider working for the &quot;enemy&quot;...<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
Hope you're having a good day.  You mentioned your interest in randomized,
longitudinal controlled studies on Naltrexone, so I've collected these.
Disclaimer: not every one of these reports fits into the category
of randomized, longitudinal controlled study, but many of them do.
What I've found interesting is how many people seem to rely on the drug
even when they're not drinking (abstinence)... when the drug is designed to
work optimally IN CONJUNCTION with alcohol.

<p>
1. Renault, P. F. (1978) Treatment of heroin-dependent persons with
antagonists: Current status. Bulletin on Narcotics 30: 21-29 <br>

status. In: Naltrexone: Research Monograph 28, Willett, R. E., and Barnett,
G., (eds.), Washington, DC: National Institute of Drug Abuse, 11 22. First
clinical trial of Naltrexone and only controlled trial for opiate
addiction. Large double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) trial (n=197) plus
1005 open-label patients. Naltrexone was effective but only in patients who
disobeyed instructions not to use opiates while on medication. Not
effective with abstinence. It was concluded that Naltrexone works by
extinction. Basis for FDA acceptance of Naltrexone for opiate addiction.

<p>

for FDA approval of Naltrexone for alcoholism. Naltrexone was safe and
effective in &quot;Coping&quot; groups inadvertently encouraged to break abstinence,
but there were no significant benefits in &quot;Supportive&quot; groups with
instructions to abstain. No significant benefits before first drink on
Naltrexone. Significant interactions indicating Naltrexone is better with
Coping than Supportive therapy.

Small DBPC trial showing Nalmefene (similar to Naltrexone) is safe and
effective in treating alcoholism. No significant benefits before first
drink on Nalmefene; the article says this finding confirms Sinclair's
hypothesis that the medication is working through extinction.

abuse: An evidence-based review. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental
Research 27(10): 1645-1656. A search of all published and unpublished
evidence showed Naltrexone and acamprosate are only the medications for
alcoholism with well-documented benefits. Naltrexone has been effective
except when used with support of abstinence. In the 2003 report, a
statistical analysis showed significantly better results with
Coping/Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) than with Supportive therapy
(p&lt;0.05) (even though the O'Malley et al., 1992, results were incorrectly
reported as significant with Supportive) and the meta-analysis showed a
significant benefit over placebo with CBT.

Research Society on Alcoholism, June 21-25, 2003, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research 27 (supplement): 191A
(abstract S170) Dual DBPC trial showed naltrexone was effective with Coping
with drinking but not with Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET). Anton in
2002 (#61) had gotten similar negative results with MET and nalmefene,
confirming that MET is like Support of Abstinence and not a suitable
protocol for opioid antagonists.

Scientific Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism, June 21-25, 2003,
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research 27
(supplement): 191A (abstract S172). In one experiment, drinking alcohol
while on Naltrexone suppressed selection of further alcoholic beverages
especially when the second presentation was not immediate but several hours
later, showing that the effect was not from rational thinking after
experiencing a lack of euphoria but rather caused by a slow mechanism
(extinction or similar to extinction) started by the lack of reinforcement.
In addition, Naltrexone was effective in blocking heavy drinking in smokers
taking the medicine for smoking and not intending nor instructed to reduce
drinking. Author's conclusion: Naltrexone should be used initially without
abstinence to reduce drinking and only after that should abstinence become
the goal.

Intensive (20 hours) therapy without medication helped increase abstinence
but did not reduce heavy drinking and did not make NTX better (the
partially abstinence oriented therapy actually tended to reduce the
benefit). Acamprosate had no significant benefits and taken at the same
time as NTX did not help NTX.
