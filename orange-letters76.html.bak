Subject:  	RRSN's Disbanding<br>

<p>
In regards as to why Jack Trimpey disbanded the R.R. groups:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
About Rational Recovery &#8212; I agree that we should avoid anything
that will turn into another cult. In defense of Jack Trimpey and
R.R., I've heard that is why he shut it down. That is, the people
who wanted to quit drinking did, and left the meetings; while the
chronic meeting attenders remained, until R.R. was just filling up
with people who wanted to have another life-long club. So Trimpey
disbanded it.
<p>
Now that's just a rumor, and I haven't gotten anything from Trimpey
explaining it one way or the other. But it makes sense. There is no
doubt that R.R. is disbanded and shut down.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Actually, it's not a rumor. It's a confirmed fact. In fact I was
thinking about the futility of groupism and realized that over time
all of the people who haven't solved their problems would remain.

<p>
It was nearly a decade or so when Jack Trimpey realized that. Now
picture groups going on for a bunch of decades. No wonder A.A. is a
sick organization!

<p>
The entire reason for R.R.S.N.'s disbanding is detailed in <i>The
Journal of Rational Recovery</i> (March-April, 1999). And, oddly enough,
I happen to have a copy at my workstation. Likewise, the gist of the
ineffectiveness of recovery groups can be found within the Web
Archive:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005312/http://tinyurl.com/lxyxp">
http://tinyurl.com/lxyxp</a>

<p>
On a sidenote about groups, since I'm a participant within the open
source movement I found an interesting article on the drawbacks on
groupism. It's definitely worth a read:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005312/http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html">
http://www.shirky.com/writings/group_enemy.html</a>

<p>
My advice for those who wish to hang out with addicts: Don't. One is
better off cultivating healthier relationships with people with
common interests rather than common problems.

<p>

That is, unless one wishes to infiltrate A.A. groups and digitally
record the verbal carnage... ;-&gt;

<p>

I see that you have quite a lengthy piece on Bill Wilson and AA.  As A
friend sent it, I am not sure if it from the web or a print journal.
<p>
Does not matter.
<p>
I se you are just not a fan of AA and are one who trashes it and
everything about it that you can.  Good for you!
<p>
As of this day, I believe we still have the Constitution in this country
(US of A) and the First Amendment still is in place.  All I can say is,
please don't go to Alcoholics Anonymous.  I am sure it would not be able
to help someone as intelligent as yourself.  It probably has not helped
many people at all.
<p>
In fact, I think that it actually went out of business for lack
attendance.  Of those few who are crazy enough to still be going, your
article should indeed dissuade them from continuing their membership.

<p>

Good job and keep up the good work.  (And you may want to get your meds

<p>

You are free to have your opinion of AA; most of which I strongly disagree.
<p>
However,
regardless of all your research etc. it is just your opinion.  While you
have quite
alot of facts, does not make what you write the &quot;truth&quot;; again just your
opinion.

That is the standard propaganda and debating trick called

No it isn't. Facts are what matter, not opinions.<br>
What facts do you have to show that A.A. is good, and
actually saves more alcoholics
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">than it kills</a>?

Please consider prefacing what you write that it is your opinion.  As with

Okay, Krystal, I've considered it, and the answer is &quot;No.&quot;

It isn't just my opinion; it is facts from quite a number of people who know what they are talking about.

<p>
Hey,Orange-
<p>
Was reading some more of your old letters some praising your
extensive work with others ranging from maybe serious questions to plain
old hate mail. I can begin to understand your &quot;anger.&quot;
<p>
Unfortunately,even with sobriety,I can be a very angry person...and have
quite a lot to be angry about...even though I wish it wasn't that way.
<p>
If I undertand what I've read:
<ul>
<li>
1.)You say you were abused (perhaps both
physically and emotionally?) as a kid by an abusive and alcoholic
father. Was I corect in reading that?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>
<li>
2.) You feel like you were,in my
words,messed around,  in going to AA meetings and by feeling they were
trying to control you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That isn't clear. &quot;Messed around?&quot; Just read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>.
<p>
And of course they &#8212; the &quot;treatment center&quot; &#8212; were trying to control us.
That was their stated goal &#8212; to get the clients
&quot;in compliance&quot; with the program.
</font>
<p>

<li>
3.)You feel that others,including your friends
have either been forced to go to AA or had something bad foisted upon
them.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
</ul>

<p>
Despite my differing perceptions of my own experience comapred to
yours; by reading your website extensively I can now see your
points, Orange. It indeed takes a LOT of difference to make this world go
around: I like the part where you answer by saying you do find happiness
in going to the beach, etc.... Power to it!
<p>
I admit I have long been
suspicious about people being forced to go to AA by the courts,etc. I am
also interested in recovery rates of Rational Recovery, etc. and saw
your comments about the recovery rates for Smart.... Keep up your good
work... If people would really read like I now have; they would find, even
in possibly disagreeing, that you provide a most valuable forum: Whether
some believe it or not; the Orange Papers may well be helping to save
many lives.... Power to you,Orange!

Hey,Orange! Hope you are indeed having a GOOD day... It is BEAUTIFUL here

it's beautiful where you are even though no quite sure where.
<p>
I liked
your reply....&quot;Messed over&quot; was used to mean like you got or felt like
you got deceived, made fun of, taken advantage of, controlled.... etc. I
agree if you felt like that at AA.... I would be angry too. You went and
needed support getting sober and feel like you got something else.... you
did NOT want. I must admit I was very fortunate here when I started
going to AA 25 years ago and got the support I needed and a sponsor who
was neighbor. He and his wife were like grandparents to me as they were
in their 80s. Mr. Pat was indeed an old-timer but did not try to cram
anything down my throat or pull any bait and switch, etc. I can see your
point and, unfortunately,believe the horror stories about AA and
treatment centers,etc... especially since I have not been in other parts
of the country except once in Boston.
<p>
Like you,Orange,I believe in God.
So that part is not hard for me. EVERYBODY should have an opportunity to
get and stay sober! That is why I have come to support you as a valuable
forum and resource for the alternatives out there as well as the
encouragement you give. See you are a Veteran too... just like my Dad.

From:  	&quot;David A&quot; <br>
Subject: Blown away by your website!<br>

<p>

Hi,

<p>

I'm absolutely blown away by your website orange-papers.info; it makes for a
very interesting read.

<p>

I hope you don't mind me writing to you like this but I have been pondering
an idea that may at some point become a reality and am interested in your
views.

<p>

As a volunteer Samaritan in the UK I frequently speak with suicidal people
many of whom are alcoholics. I am also a regular attendee of Alcoholics
Anonymous and have been clean and sober for a number of years.

<p>

I've gotten it into my head that what chronic alcoholics really need are
local support groups that don't mess with their minds. It is a fact that
people without community become depressed and commit suicide at a higher
rate and for that reason believe that a sense of belonging (to a community)
is in fact the real underlying healer within AA. &#8212; Samaritans are trained to
go about things in a different way, we do not give advice or make promises;
we instead just listen to people who are in despair usually by phone and
sometimes face to face and stick to talking about how feelings. Samaritans
has a logical training program, AA has none. AA offers a sense of belonging,
something Samaritans cannot do. I came to believe that a good solution for
many alcoholics could be created by pooling the logical aspects of both.

<p>

&gt;From what I have read I do not believe you think AA to be a complete waste
of time. With that in mind I would like to say that what seems to be missing
from your website is an article about what you do think works within AA and
for one would be particularly interested.

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
It only takes two people for a community to exist. I think Bill Wilson hit
the nail on the head when he talked about realising that he could only stay
away from a drink by talking to another alcoholic. He needed a community. &#8212;
Perhaps it is not resentments that are the number one killer of alcoholics
but isolation.

<p>

Regards,

<p>

David A.

Hello David,
<p>

We have been talking about what works, and what helps, all through the letters.
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works">Look here</a> for one list of such discussions.
<p>
<a href="orange-letters70.html#method1">Here is another letter</a>
that discusses recovery techniques.

<p>
Also see
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a> for another slant
on &quot;addictive thinking&quot;, and how to recognize it and overcome it.

<p>
Also see
<a href="orange-top10.html">the Top 10 reading list</a> for more good things.
<p>

It may be that social groups are a help in preventing suicide, or encouraging people to quit
harmful habits, but Alcoholics Anonymous has not provided any evidence of that.
A.A. actually
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">increases the rate of binge drinking</a>, and
raises
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">the death rate</a> of alcoholics.

<p>
We were just talking about the down side of recovery groups in another letter,
<a href="orange-letters76.html#sick_groups">here</a>.
The problem is that the healthier people recover and leave the group and get on with their lives, while
the chronically ill who won't recover hang around for years and become the group's old-timers and mentors,
and they teach their insanity to the newcomers.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Orange &#8212; 

<p>
First off, you are clearly quite intelligent and funny, and I admire your
passion. You are trying to help people and are putting a lot of energy into
it. Kudos.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Scott,
<p>
Thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>
And, no, I haven't read everything on your site &#8212; its breadth and depth alone
are impressive! So I might be repeating what someone else might have written
to you before. But here goes...

<p>
One of the most important aspects of 12-step to me is the imperative that
you take what you like and leave the rest. The literature itself says the
steps are but suggestions. Don't like what one guy (or several people) keeps
saying at meetings? Fine, don't listen, or pick another meeting. Don't
believe in a written moral inventory? OK, skip step four &#8212; we won't, in fact
CAN'T kick you out. Don't want to put a buck, or even a penny in the basket
ever? No one (or at least no one who understands the 12 Traditions) will bat
an eye. (And those that do? Leave them with the stuff you don't like.) Don't
want a sponsor? Hell, don't want to even come to meetings? It's OK if you
want to just study and work the steps in the privacy of your own home! No
one can deny you membership &#8212; you're in if you say you're in.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The &quot;Steps are but suggestions&quot; and &quot;take what you like&quot;
statements are simply not true. It's
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2">a bait-and-switch trick</a>.
Those easy-going statements are accompanied by other statements that people failed
and died drunk because they
didn't &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot; and wouldn't &quot;go to any length&quot;.
<p>
Well, A.A. can't have it both ways.
Either you can work a very lose, define-it-yourself program, and it's okay;
or you have to &quot;really try&quot; and &quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;, or else.
<p>
Which is it?

<p>
I guess what I'm saying is, in some places it seems like what you're
attacking here are certain people in or around AA rather than the steps
themselves. Unlike Scientology, or some of the other cults you talk about,
AA has no one making millions off of it. There's no profit motive. Hell,
there's no profit, as AA barely stays afloat financially. Yes, all you say
about judges and counselors is true, but they aren't actually affiliated
with AA. And I'm sure that your response here will be to direct me to a
section of your site where you illustrate how closely tied the counselling
and courts are to AA, maybe even specific accounts. But again, these are
specific people who do not represent AA as a whole. Take what you like and
leave the rest.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No profit motive? You should look again.
<a href="orange-letters65.html#AA_financials">Check out this letter</a>.
A.A. is making millions, and is doing it by
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">committing perjury and fraud and even hurting
innocent A.A. members</a>, and getting them sentenced to prison on the basis of A.A. lies.
</font>
<p>

Maybe AA is the go-to guy for judges and counselors simply because it is
free and prevalent. OK. But there's no one IN AA who is financially
benefitting from the stream of people attending. There's no Falwell or
Koresh. These judges and counselors don't get kickbacks or anything.

<p>
<font color="blue">
See the financial statement above.
<p>
And counselors don't need kickbacks. They are A.A. members who get paid by federal, state, and municipal
programs and health insurance plans to proselytize and spread 12-Step propaganda.
They are professional 12-Step recruiters. (And then they even occasionally double-bill to make more money.)
</font>
<p>

Still, I guess you might be upset more because sending folks to AA is just
such a given in our society, and you view AA as a religion, and this means
to you a comingling of church and state. (Actually, you can take out the
&quot;might be&quot; there. I've read enough of the site to have figured that out!)
But, again, if AA has no &quot;musts&quot; and all the steps are but suggestions, and
you can work them or not work them any which way you want without fear of
being &quot;kicked out&quot; &#8212; how is that a religion?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Or maybe I'm upset because people are getting fraud and quackery when their health insurance
is paying for &quot;treatment&quot;. Maybe I'm upset that the state of the art in treating addictions
and alcoholism is a big lie.
</font>
<p>

And, as I can see, you have problems with the steps themselves, as your
exhaustive interpretation of them shows. But, at the risk of sounding
redundant, there are as many ways of interpreting those steps as there are
people on this planet. If I want to define my higher power as Good Orderly
Direction or Group Of Drunks or The Steps or The Process or a plant or a
river or literally anything, I'm allowed.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is nothing to brag about. You think that gross heresy and idolatry is a good thing?
What kind of a wonderful cult religion is that?
<p>
And what does such idolatry have to do with quitting drinking?
</font>
<p>

Maybe I don't want to seek through
prayer and mediatation. Maybe I want to seek through positive action in my
community or improved relationships with loved ones. Oops, I just jumped
over step eleven! Are the AA cult police going to come and get me now? No.
It's my interpretation. I took what I liked and left the rest. The stories
of AA folks who do things like this everyday are infinite in number. My
advice to AAs who run into other AAs who command rather than suggest, who
push their brand of faith rather than share their experience is &#8212; you guessed
it &#8212; take what you like etc.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, if you do not &quot;<i>thoroughly</i> follow our path&quot; and won't &quot;go to
<i>any</i> length&quot;, then it's your own damn fault that you relapsed and died drunk.
<p>
Besides, which, if the program is so loose that you can do anything that you wish, then
there isn't really any program.
<p>
What is the real, essential part of the program that you absolutely must do in order to succeed
at quitting drinking and staying sober?<br>
What is the real program?<br>
(Besides &quot;don't drink alcohol&quot;... But that isn't a program. That's a commandment.)
</font>
<p>

And that's what I found most interesting about your site: the section on
&quot;What's Good About AA.&quot; You mention the rare instances for you of meeting
people in meetings who really knew what they were talking about and were
helpful. What happened to the ones you met? Are you still connected to them?
Or even to just memories of things they said to you, things you shared with
each other? Does it help you stay away from a drink today? Are those things
you liked and kept, while you left the rest (which, in your case, would be
almost all of it, but still)? If so, I'm sincerely glad for you. Or even if
not, even if you took absolutely nothing away from AA, and you're still
happier today than when you were drinking, I'm sincerely glad for you. It's
your path, and whatever works is great.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are really grasping at straws. I mentioned that I met a few nice people, and you want
to claim that I am sober because of them?
<p>
No. That isn't how it is. You might as well try to claim that I am sober because of
<a href="orange-intro.html#porno">the cocaine-snorting, child-molesting,
Internet-child-pornographer, dogmatic 12-Stepper &quot;counselor&quot;</a>
that I had in the &quot;treatment&quot; program.
<p>
And no, I am not still in contact with them, and no, they didn't teach me a bunch of good things.
Most of them would be described as well-meaning confused people who prattled A.A. nonsense.
</font>
<p>
I guess what it boils down to for me is:

<p>
1) All people are flawed. Some greatly so. (One section I heartily agree
with you on is what a way-way-less-than perfect person Bill W was. Way.)
Some of them are counselors and judges. Some of them go to AA meetings, and
some of these say and do messed up things. And I can see where it might be a
good thing to expose the wrongdoers and their deeds. But they are NOT AA
itself.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But seriously flawed people have no business passing themselves off as
spiritual mentors and drug-and-alcohol rehab counselors. And that is
what is happening in Alcoholics Anonymous, and that is inherently
the nature of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>

2) AA itself is all based on 12 suggestions that can be interpreted an
infinite number of ways, including the partial or entire ignoring of them.
Same goes for all the literature, as well as the other tools. Keep an open
mind about stuff, use what works for you, don't use what doesn't. You
yourself seem to have done this. Why begrudge others who'd like to do the
same?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, if the steps can be interpreted any way you wish, then there are no steps and there is
no program.
<p>
What I &quot;begrudge&quot; is foisting ineffective quackery on sick people.
That is wrong. It is legally wrong, and it is morally wrong.
</font>
<p>

Because in the end, there are so very many folks in AA who are doing what
you're doing &#8212; trying to help people in a way that makes sense to them.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are advocating letting the lunatics run the insane asylum.
<p>
Just &quot;trying to help people&quot; is not a good enough excuse for
what Alcoholics Anonymous is actually doing.
<p>
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.
</font>
<p>
It may not be the way you or even I would try to help. But I think the action
(like your search for the truth on this site) is inherently good.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is baloney. Is the &quot;action&quot; of Scientology good?<br>
How about the &quot;action&quot; of 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones">Rev. Jim Jones's People's Temple</a>?<br>
How about the &quot;action&quot; of 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon">Synanon</a>?
<p>
Weren't all of those things &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;for the good&quot; of addicts and alcoholics?
<p>
All three of those cults ran drug and alcohol rehab programs, you know.
(Befuddled alcoholics and addicts are easy targets for cults.)
</font>

<p>
Am I wrong, or are you taking on AA as a whole when the problem is really people
(and there are plenty of them) who wrongly present it or use it (i.e.
religion-pushers, ego-trippers, predators and the like)?

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are wrong. The A.A. program itself is a fraud that was
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">derived from an old fascist cult religion</a>.
It was never a method for recovery.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">It never worked</a>.
Bill Wilson just lied about the failure rate, and made grandiose claims of success when he had none.
The A.A. program didn't work then, and it doesn't work now.
</font>
<p>
Food for thought.
<p>
Anyway, I do wish you well in your enjoyment of life. And if this cause
energizes and motivates you, well keep on truckin'. Maybe what you're doing,
at the very least, helps people sort things out and find their own paths to
recovery and strength. Kinda like AA, if I dare say.

<p>
Take care,<br>
Scott

From:  	&quot;Steve B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	RE: Answer to your letter<br>

<p>

Thanks for the personal response. I was wondering if I'd hear from you.
The &quot;Lizard Brain Addiction Monster&quot; is spot on. That little addictive
voice has been my downfall. I know where it's coming from now (damn my
base brain). Now that I've been sober for 5 months, he talks to me once
in awhile. I recognize the little bastard.

<p>

I've been reading Stanton Peele's &quot;Love and Addiction&quot; and it's pretty
interesting.

<p>

Unfortunately for me, I've screwed up enough in the past that I'm going
to have to go through the motions in AA for at least another 7 months to
keep my wife happy. It's like being on probation even thought I've never
been arrested for anything. The thing that really amazes me about AA is
that the group actually worships alcohol like it's some kind of powerful
entity. It's not.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Steve,
<p>
Yes, right on. If you think about it for a while, the idea that a bottle of
C2H5OH being more powerful than you are is absurd.
<p>
Heck, I have so much power over it that I can even light it on fire and burn it and
use it to heat up a cup of coffee.
</font>
<p>

I have another alternative to AA for you:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005312/http://racingforrecovery.com/">racingforrecovery.com</a>.
Todd Crandell was an addict for years and used AA to finally get himself
sober. Now he's moved away from AA and has a program that doesn't follow
the 12 steps. I met him recently and was impressed with what he had to
say. He doesn't believe in powerlessness and neither do I. He doesn't
believe in relapse. He believes in &quot;rechoice&quot;.

<p>

I like your website a lot. There's so much information on the splash
page that it's kind of overwhelming.

<p>

Keep on giving us the truth.

<p>

Take care.

Date:  	Tue, October 10, 2006 3:02 am<br>
From:  	&quot;James B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Yo Orange!<br>

<p>
Hey there Orange

<p>
Thanks again and again for the website &#8212; it really 'joined the dots' up for me
concerning AA &#8212; without it I am sure I would still be sitting in meetings, frowning
at the floor, trying to figure out the 'not quite right' feeling in my stomach.

<p>
I want to start with a point I made to my GF &#8212; when I was drinking, I certainly,
most absolutely had methods/ways of controlling the amount I drank; let me explain:
if I had a huge binge, there is no way I would get drunk for the next two or three
days &#8212; I would be feeling too ill, too depressed.  I was also a big fan of coke and
XTC and, again, I would space these out over time, so as to save feeling to ill, and
the 'brain aches' that these substances would cause.  And probably, indirectly,
protecting my health.  Looking back, without this kind of hap-hazard discipline &#8212;
though I was most certainly an addict/alky &#8212; then I would probably be dead.
<p>
However, if I had carried the belief around that I was powerless, which I did not,
as I had had no contact with AA, I wonder whether it would have thrown a spanner in
the works.  I reckon that if I believed I was powerless over the stuff then my
binges would be closer together and even more dangerous.  I wonder how many alkies
and drug users are out there right now just saying 'what the hell, I am powerless,
pass me the bong/pipe/beer'.  Alcoholics are powerless.  What a nasty, thoughtless,
bit of information that is.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, James,
<p>
Yes, really. And some alcoholics die because they believe that they really are powerless,
so why try to fight it? It's hopeless.
</font>
<p>

One of my values, that I try/struggle to live by is to try and live with people on
an equal, respectful level be they sinner, saint, criminal, alky, priest, or genius,
whoever.  To realise that we all deserve respect and are full have worth for just
being a living, feeling animals.  I realise now, a year out of AA, how that really
did not apply much in the rooms.  Man, I felt like I was nothing to those old timers
&#8212; they were all wise, more enlightened, more spiritual than I was.  In fact, at
times, I felt like nothing &#8212; just a diseased creep who had been selfish and an ego
maniac from the day he was born.
<p>
Since leaving AA I have found it very difficult to
regain some sort of love and tolerance for my fellow humans &#8212; I learnt about
contempt for the darker side of human nature in AA.  I learnt about sin.  Look how
bad we are, and look how good God is. I still sometimes see through that dark
filter.
<p>
So its just a case now of me focusing on the good in human beings, because
it is the good I will remember on my death bed &#8212; I think my memories of people when
I am dying will hopefully be good ones, of all the good people  have shown me over
the years.  I certainly won't be laying there 'handing it over', or 'seeing my part'
in things, or thinking about selfishness, self seeking and all that shit..  I am
only 25 and I am thinking about death!
<p>
But this is a philosophical journey that I
am on now since leaving AA, and I have really had to sit down and think about some
of the big questions, which has helped with the deprogramming because most of what I
value in life is in direct contradiction to the ravings of Wilson.  I realise now
that AA was depriving me of my huge parts of my own mind, my ability to interpret my
life in any way I damn pleased &#8212; it took that ability away from me.

<p>
Its so great to be free!  I am still sober, clean, after leaving AA and the freedom
feels overwhelming.  I am, for the first time in my life, relatively sane as well,
as well as physically fit.  Each day is no longer full of fear, or frustration, or
wildness &#8212; instead each day is full of hard work, clear thinking, and a simple but
fulfilling code to treat others with respect, don't do anything stupid like drink
thirty coffees, and now and then use 'reason' on my thoughts and motives.  That's
the only 'program' I do.

<p>
So there is an update from me, and I hope that the positive tone of the letter might
give someone out there that if they are suffering in AA that life can be good
without booze and without AA.

<p>
Thanks again Orange!

<p>
James

From:  	&quot;MARY C.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	How do they have fun?<br>

<p>

Want to know the MAIN REASON drinkers don't quit???  How the hell would they have
fun????  I am a once or twice a week beer drinker and wouldn't give it up if hell
froze over.  I tried pot once, didn't go back to it, and don't mess with drugs.  If
you can get your ass up in the morning to go to work, you are okay.  If you marry or
go out with another drinker, nobody will bother you!  I still smoke, too, and
wouldn't give that up either.  Once people quit drinking, they will never have fun
again and they know it.  People act as if drinkers WANT to quit.  What they have to
learn to do is to DELAY their drinking so they complete the work week and AVOID
people in their personal lives who don't want them to drink.  HAH!

Subject:  	Fw: How do they have fun?<br>

<p>

P.S.  The problem, of course, is this:  some drinkers become violent.  My late
husband was like that and so is my niece's husband.  I've often suggested that she
develop a &quot;shed&quot; situation where he drinks outside of the home with buddies and
stays with them or sleeps in the shed until the following morning.  I have known
plenty of people  who were court-mandated into treatment.  They KNOW that alcohol
only remains in the system for 24 hours so they go to the program all week and drink
Friday night and part of Saturday so they will pass the pee-test on Monday.  Once
probation is off their backs, they go out and celebrate.  We are becoming too
intrusive in people's lives.  If someone isn't a danger to others when he or she
drinks, then leave him or her alone!

Subject:  	Fw: How do they have fun?<br>

<p>

P.S.S.  PLUS I think the tough-love thing DAMAGES many people, particularly women
who have been abused or victimized physically or sexually.  They are drinking or
drugging to FORGET, to numb the pain for a while.  Mixing drinkers and druggers
doesn't work, either.  Pure drinkers are not as sneaky as druggers.  They are more
honest.  Most drinkers will not steal from loved ones to buy drink or prostitute or
steal to get it.  When they are placed in a &quot;tough love&quot; environment with druggers
and are shown these scenarios, they say, Hey, wait a minute, that's not me.  I don't
do those things.  I can buy the suitcase of the week at the beer house for ten
bucks.  My habit won't escalate to thousands of dollars.  I also strongly think
people are CROSS-ADDICTIVE.  Take away their alcohol and they'll smoke and eat more,
etc.  The addiction will go somewhere else where nobody has identified it to chase
it yet.  Society needs to leave people the hell alone.  The solution to drunk
driving (my only bad outcome after being battered for many years and my husband
dying suddenly) is NOT TO DRIVE DRUNK.  You plan how you will get home after you go
to the bar or plan to stay overnight with friends.  You don't take the car.  I
didn't give up drinking.  I gave up driving!  I am a strong-minded individual whose
first reaction to any mandate is to defy it for pure spite.  I could tell you many
funny stories.  My late husband had a friend, Crazy Billy, who would sit in the back
of AA meetings with a tall can in a bag.  Then he went up with a straight face to
get his chits signed for probation.  30 years later, he still drinks and looks
rather healthy and okay.  I knew a very tiny girl who kicked a cop in the leg who
took away her can of beer in a public place and she kicked him in the leg.  She was
placed in a program and complained to me on the bus all the time.  Although she
weighed about 90 pounds, she calculated how long she could drink from Friday release
time until Saturday noon and still pass the pee test.  I remember getting OFF the
bus as she was about to board the bus, sipping from a bagged can by the beer house.
&quot;I just graduated from my drinking program and I'm celebrating,&quot; she confided.  SHE
still drinks, ten years later, and works two jobs.  My niece and her husband BOTH
drink.  He's usually the fall guy, ending up in jail, although she physically starts
as many fights as he does.  I am usually the bouncer, breaking the fights up and
preventing the cops from being called.  I can remember one family birthday when the
ten-year-old lookout spying out the front window spotted the ubiquitous white car:
IT'S THE WELFARE.  We all scrambled for the bathroom, cans in hand.  As eight of us
cowered in the john, this smart ten-year-old nonchalantly slow-walked the empty
Coors 30-pack cardboard carton to the bathroom door and heaved it in.  HEY, WE ALL
STILL DRINK!  Guarantee ya that we're all part of someone's optimistic social
program statistics that we quit, too, just as your study suggests.  As we would say
in the poverty community about the non-drinking mind-controllers trying to force
their abstinence on us all:  FUCK THEM.  Pardon my French.

Plus, the REASON I got the DWI's after my husband died was that HE ALWAYS DROVE and
apparently had better luck evading the cops on the way home from the bar than I did.
SOLUTION:  leave the car home.  Take the bus to the pub and have the barkeep hold
cab money for you.  If you are not violent, then you won't get in trouble.

Hi there AO

<p>
Very much enjoying your site and the wealth of information.  It's very helpful that
you include references.  As someone who's been in Al Anon and felt highly
uncomfortable about a lot of the dogma &#8212; not least our 'special relationship' with
AA &#8212; it's refreshing indeed to see that I'm not the only one with doubts.

<p>
I've seen long timers in AA/Al Anon and feel pleased that for whatever reason
they've found help.  It didn't really work for me.  Lots of passive aggressive stuff
'shared' and also supposed confidences from AA meetings being 'shared' in Al Anon.

<p>
Highly interested in the 'thirteenth step' as I had often suspected that 'i'm off to
a meeting' was a euphemism for hanky panky.

<p>
Keep up the good work, mate.  You've beat me to what was going to be my PhD work but
since you've done it so well how can I complain!

<p>
Namaste

AA concepts did come from the Chapter of James in the Bible. Everyone
has Truths, I know what my Truths are, I'm sure you know yours as well.
But not everything is the Gospel either...

<p>
interesting perspective you have.

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>

It is my impression that prior to formal organization in the early days,
from the book about Dr. Bob, the religiously fanatical control freak
participated in ad hoc meetings that gave credence to James 3 verse 3-6:
focusing specifically on verse 4:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
3. When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we
can turn the whole animal.
<li>
4.  Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are
driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever
the pilot wants to go.
<li>
5.  Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great
boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
<li>
6.  The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the
body.  It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life
on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
</ul>

<p>

I used to meditate on this chapter frequently between meetings.  Taken
out of context you can see that it can be misused as a rather powerful
passage.  Now that I have broken free from the chains of 15 years of AA
bondage, I find that at work I am able to articulate thoughts more
clearly (particularly personal ones) and people don't look at me like an
idiot.  The benefits of non-membership outweigh membership 200 to 1.  I
have to learn to outlive the fear that, in the long run, not going to a
meeting is going to ultimately ruin my life.  All it is is a fear, and
not a valid one.

<p>

Sidebar:  Orange, I think, has a unique gift/talent.  I wonder if he had
experienced a 'Rites of passage' ordeal and shagged Grace Slick during
one of his historical escapades throughout the 60's?/  please, ...pardon

From:  	&quot;Jay B.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	new letter<br>

<p>

Dear Orange

<p>

I couldn't see a way of posting on your site so am emailing this to you, (if
you print this then you can delete this bit)

<p>

Today is my 2nd AA birthday.

<p>

I am 41 and have abused alcohol since the age of 15, I had never seen a
doctor to discuss problems or even admitted that I have  drinking problem.

<p>

3 years ago I was in an unhappy marriage, had lost a job I held for 10 yrs
and was completely on my knees.
<p>
I drove drunk to  bridge and decided to finish the last 4 cans and jump but
didn't have the bottle so decided to join AA.

<p>

Since then I have stopped drinking, left my wife, stopped contact with much
of my &quot;insane&quot; family, and am self (un) employed .i.e provide IT services
for companies but have no clients.
<p>
BUT  still not drinking !  remembering its my first priority.

<p>

My head is in turmoil most days and the only way of feeling OK is to go to
nightly meetings.

<p>

That was until recently , I took all of AA on board because I was close to
suicide and I truly believe that they saved my life.
<p>
What I started to doubt was the rest of it
<p>
I could see people in the rooms who needed medical help but instead just
came to live a groundhog day every night.
<p>
I could see people on benefits talking about working but doing nothing to
get work and running to the arms of the AA rooms to feel better every night
<p>
I could see sexual predators making vulnerable women more vulnerable

<p>

On a personal level I started to question my own sickness.

<p>

I haven't wanted a drink since this time 2 yrs ago, I had not done any steps
at that point but still thanked  the program for my stopping
<p>
I have ADHD (diagnosed by  a shrink 2 yrs ago but have not told any members
or my sponsor)
<p>
I now realise that I have been controlled my whole life by low self esteem
<p>
I also now know that I have had periods of depression throughout my adult
life
<p>
I also know that I have suffered from anxiety for much of my life

<p>

I have read pretty much all of this site in the last 2 days (done little
else) and am in total confusion!

<p>

I agree with most of what  you say, I no longer believe I have a spiritual
problem, or that alcoholism is a disease, or that AA is the only way.
<p>
I am  starting to believe that some people I know are actually being harmed.
<p>
I think I need to learn more about behavioral therapies for my ADHD, some
CBT for my low self esteem, some re-exposure to life beyond the rooms, etc

<p>

my problem is what do i do tonight when my friends will celebrate my second
year, do I tell them what I have written above or just slowly walk away and
hope they come to their senses, i dunno ( maybe need to hand this over :) )

<p>

Thank you for your site , you have put into words what I have been thinking.

<p>

Please post this ( correct my spelin m1stakes if you can )

<p>

I'm off to the rooms.

<p>

Jay (B.)<br>
please remove my surname if you do feel this is worth posting

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jay,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You make a lot of good points.
<p>
Congratulations on your new sobriety. That's great. It sounds like you are really making
progress in working through your problems.
<p>
What to tell your friends? It depends on the friend.
<p>
The few real friends that we are lucky enough to have will understand &#8212; you can tell them the
truth.
<p>
The acquaintances who merely grant you conditional approval will of
course drop you quickly if you tell them truths that they don't want
to hear. But you don't need them.
<p>
In the long run, you will need to work on developing a new circle of friends, especially
&quot;normal&quot; people who are not &quot;in recovery&quot;.
Then you can talk about other things besides
drugs and alcohol and tragedies.
<p>
It reminds me of a line that I wrote five ago:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I am still noticing what a joy it is to talk to an attractive
young woman about drug or alcohol problems, and hear her respond,
&quot;Oh, I don't do that kind of stuff. I think it would just mess
me up...&quot; Then we are free to talk about other stuff, like
art, music, computers, children, or whatever... <i>Anything but
more stories of misery. Anything but more stories of
drug and alcohol problems.</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

Hey Orange,
<p>
down at the dog park I met a AA oldtimer who said Dr Bob was
drunk in the last months of his life, do you have any info on this  statement.

<p>
Recovered Rusty

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Rusty,
<p>
Now that's an interesting question. I don't know. I never heard that one before.
I would sure like to collect some facts on the subject.
<p>
We were just talking about Bill Wilson relapsing repeatedly.
<a href="orange-letters67.html#Wilson_drunk">This correspondent</a> said
that Bill Wilson rarely got more than
one year of sobriety before relapsing.
<p>
And I've been wondering for years whether
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">the story in the <i>Big Book</i></a>
about somebody (who looks just like Bill Wilson)
getting drunk and throwing a screaming temper tantrum because his wife nagged him
to quit smoking was really 100% autobiographical:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here is a case in point: One of our friends is a heavy
smoker and coffee drinker. There was no doubt he over-indulged.
Seeing this, and meaning to be helpful, his wife
commenced to admonish him about it. He admitted he was
overdoing these things, but frankly said that he was not
ready to stop. His wife is one of those persons who really feels
there is something rather sinful about these commodities, so
she nagged, and her intolerance finally threw him into a fit
of anger. He got drunk.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
Bill Wilson, the &quot;<i>Big Book</i>&quot;, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, in
the chapter &quot;The Family Afterward&quot;, on page 135 (3rd and 4th editions).

</blockquote>
<p>
Was that really Bill Wilson?

<p>
I'll keep my antenna up for any news about either Bill Wilson or Dr. Bob drinking.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

Hi Stanton, Orange, Jack,

<p>

Just wanted to let you know about this piece of legislation in the DYING
session of Congress that Rep. Kennedy (yes-the alcoholic/addict one from R.I.)
is trying to get somehow &quot;petitioned&quot; out of committee, and PASSED before the
end of the current Congressional session. The bill appears to be trying to get
&quot;parity&quot; for public funding for ADDICTION TREATMENT, and you know what a
racket that is. You might want to put an &quot;alert&quot; about it on your web-sites,
AND blast an e-mail off to your own Congressperson about the BS of publically
funded addiction &quot;treatment&quot;.

<p>

Just letting you know about this, &quot;news you can use&quot;.

<p>

John McC., RAS

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I'll put this up immediately. This sounds like a variation of
the previous bill,
<a href="orange-action.html">
H.R.1258, the &quot;Time for Recovery and Equal Access
to Treatment in America (TREAT America) Act of 2005&quot;</a>.

<p>
Those guys just won't ever quit. So neither can we. Okay, everybody, please blitz your Congressman
and Senators. Remember that this is an election year, and we have 3 weeks during which to really
tell our politicians that we don't want to pay for more quackery.
Nor do we want the government financing cult religion.
<p>
Demand that treatment centers
PROVE that their treatment works, or else they don't get paid for it.
&#8212; That means, <i>prove it with randomized longitudinal controlled studies</i>.

<p>
We can use the same steps as in the web page for opposition to H.R.1258</a>.
Just substitute the number &quot;1402&quot; for &quot;1258&quot;. Otherwise, the differences aren't worth mentioning. It's the same racket.
It's the same tear-jerker routine of yammering about how &quot;mental patients&quot; must get &quot;equal
treatment&quot; and &quot;parity&quot;. What it really means is that the Stepper clinics want more money for
12-Step drug and alcohol treatment.
<p>
Please write to your representatives to oppose this bill &#8212; and really harp on the demand for testing
of drug and alcohol treatments. That is what the Steppers cannot stand, because the 12-Step treatment
is a total fraud that has never passed a valid test.
<p>
And have a good day.

 Hi Orange,
<p>

     Since the current session of Congress dies on
 01/03, and a new two year session starts on that date,
 the vigilance will have to be ESPECIALLY earnest
 after 01/03, as then the 12-Steppers will have a FULL
 TWO YEARS to re-introduce another pathetic 12-Step
 oriented bill! There is an excellent web-site to track
 bills in Congress at: &quot;thomas.loc.gov&quot;. On that site,
 you can track a bill by bill number, author, status in
 the process (committee, house or senate floor, etc.).
 I agress that a LOT of &quot;counter-stalking&quot; needs to be
 done on these obscene pieces of pro-12-Step
 legislation. It can't get worse then it already is,
 but they sure as hell are trying to make it that way!

Hi Orange,

<p>

Just wondering, in the course of putting together all of the excellent
material that makes up &quot;orange-papers.info&quot;, how much &quot;correspondence&quot; you had
with the AA &quot;GSO&quot;, if any. I came across a nice healthy SCREAMING
contradiction on AA's &quot;New Group&quot; format that points out that &quot;no member
should be required to CONFORM to any particular belief&quot;, yet that a group MUST
CONFORM to the &quot;12-Traditions&quot;. I sent the AA GSO a letter requesting
clarification on this obvious contradiction. I am wondering what kind of
response I will get if any.
