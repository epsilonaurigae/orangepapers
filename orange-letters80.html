From:  	&quot;Alex C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	6 years, on your own? Wow.<br>

<p>

I came across your website. If I missed it, please tell me how to get to your
personnal story. I want to know your life, your successes and failures, your good
times and bad times.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Alex,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
While I have placed some autobiographical material on the Orange Papers web site, the web site
is not really about me, and I don't plan to write my whole autobiography right now.
For some information, see these links:
<p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction, my introduction to A.A.</a>, and also
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">the &quot;treatment&quot;
bait-and-switch trick</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters26.html#who_r_u">who are you</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-letters18.html#biography">who are you, 2</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">another friend goes missing</a>.
<li> the story about &quot;<a href="orange-ratpark.html">Rat Park</a>&quot;.
</ul>

</font>
<p>


You sobered up at 54, I wonder how long it took and for how
long you wanted it. How long doesn't matter, does it, because you did it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
How long did it take? The depends on what you mean by that, on what the words mean to you and
what you think &quot;quitting&quot; really is.<br>
On the one hand, it took about 18
years of drinking too much to finally get totally done with it and be really sick and tired of being sick
and tired.<br>
On the other hand,
<a href="orange-letters26.html#what_works">it took about 5 seconds to quit drinking</a>, once
I really decided to do it.

</font>
<p>



I believe
that it takes people what it takes and not everyone that goes to A.A. makes it.
That's a fact.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Not everyone makes it anywhere, any way.
</font>
<p>



I am a member and I have 70 days today, more than any other time
except a year ago, when I did five months and relapsed on my own. It is honestly a
million times harder on A.A. then on my own, a year ago, but I feel good because I
am finally growing up, spiritually and emotionaly.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Are you saying that it is harder to quit drinking in A.A. than alone, on your own?
<p>
Who told you that involvement with A.A. was &quot;growing up, spiritually and emotionally&quot;?
I disagree with that statement, of course.
</font>
<p>



It's real now for I am aware now
of my human flaws which can be reverse, through service of others and serious
action. I always been too smart for my own and I let God take over, my God you see.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is cultish self-flagellation. That is bad for you. That is unfortunately the kind of stuff
that A.A. teaches. It sometimes even drives people to suicide.

</font>
<p>

I was an atheist and that got me nowhere. I let an invisible force take care of
things....how odd. But I believe in this invisible force of love, and it makes that
world of difference. Faith.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for showing us that the cult has really gotten to you.<br>
(Where was atheism supposed to get you,
anyway? Do you choose your beliefs based on estimated profit?)

</font>
<p>



The steps only help you stay sober, it is a program of
action, not just letting God do all the work.
<p>
<font color="blue">

So why do you have the slogan,
<font color="#4f007f"><i><b>
&quot;Let Go And Let God&quot;</b></i></font>?
It seems like A.A. talks out of both sides of
it's mouth on every subject.
</font>
<p>

<a name="Pacific_Group"> </a>
I go to the Pacific Group, Los Angeles, which donates one dollar per year
of sobriety of all members to the NY headquarters. Last year, PG donated
 over 11,000 dollars.
<p>
<font color="blue">
So why on Earth are you donating money to some criminals in New York who have
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury">even committed perjury against innocent A.A. members</a>
to get them sentenced to a year in prison?
<p>
What don't you fire those overpaid crooks and get some honest leaders?
</font>
<p>


We have about 1,500
members give or take, not all stay. Average, 4 to 6 years. My figures. For one
year. I have 70 days. 4 years sounds like the place I want to be at.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your 70 days of sobriety.
</font>
<p>
<a name="everything_cult"> </a>
Some members
feel like they are good and ready and don't need the group and leave after a few
years, and no one stops them. It's their sobriety they risk. A.A. is a cult in a
way, really, but so where all religions.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, that is simply not true at all. That is a standard dodge that cults use:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Everything is a cult.  All churches are cults.&quot;
</i></font><br>
That just isn't so.
That is just standard old
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>,
something that alcoholics are rumored to be good at.

</font>
<p>


A.A. is not a religion because the God is
not defined, the monetary aims are only to support that group and operations, and
A.A. gains members through just being there, not by force. Take it or leave it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is most assuredly a religion, and &quot;God&quot; is defined as the patriarchal
dictatorial tyrant who will restore you
to sanity in Step 2, take care of your will and your life for you in Step 3,
 remove your defects in
Step 7, and talk to you and give you work orders and power in Step 11.
The A.A. &quot;God&quot; is also the monster who will make you die of
alcohol poisoning unless you kiss his ass every day.
</font>
<p>


It
seems to me
that you are not familiar with corruption and how it prevails everywhere where good
men do nothing. There are countless A.A. groups out there that suck big time. You
just have to know if you seen both, good and bad.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are engaging in minimization and denial:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Everything is corrupt, so it's okay if A.A. is
corrupt too.&quot;
</i></font>

</font>
<p>


I love A.A. &#8212; Pacific Group,
Downey Group, and Bellfower Group. Good people and strict to the Book, Steps,
Traditons, and truly there for service. I am 22 years old in a few days.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I was 60 years old two months ago.
</font>
<p>


I believe
I can do it, for it's up to ME to do it. However, I need help for I am powerless
over alcohol because I tried for years to quit.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are not powerless over alcohol. 
</font>
<p>

That is what got me to A.A. on my
own, my bottom was of a deep human nature, not material. Knowing in my heart that I
couldn't stop, no matter how hard I tried.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney.
</font>
<p>


Working the steps and letting that
alcoholic cloud clear from my head, allowing growth as a human, and being of
service will give me the tools to not be powerless anymore.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Bullshit. The 12 Steps do not give you &quot;tools&quot;.
They are cult practices for recruiting and indoctrinating
cult members. That is what
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">Frank Buchman developed those practices for</a>,
and that is what they still do.
</font>
<p>


Yet, I can't drink my
good man, not ever again without losing control for I love Alcohol. It might not be
the first
drink, for it's never that first drink, it's the one after the other that do me in,
sooner or later, I will fall to the cycle again.
<p>
<font color="blue">
The fact that you should not drink alcohol or you will become readdicted
 does not make you powerless over alcohol.
</font>
<p>


Sobriety is sobriety and if you
break your sobriety, I expect most people, in program or not, will drink
excessively. It woundn't surprise me if I binged after relapsing, because I always
binged, always. It ridiculous that you blame the first step on this one.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is unclear. Blame the first step for what? 
Are you talking about the fact that some people binge worse after A.A. convinces them that they
are powerless over alcohol?
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">That is an established fact.</a> Telling people that they
are powerless over alcohol cripples them.
</font>
<p>


I used to
binge drink before I joined A.A. I didn't binge when I relapsed a year ago, after 5
months of sobriety on my own, without a structure of any kind. I took me months
before I lost complete control again. It's different for everyone. Well, I am glad
you have 6 months, A.A. or not, you are in my respects.
<p>
<font color="blue">
It's 6 years, not 6 months. I think that's a typo.
<p>
The fact that your bingeing has diminished might mean that you are simply
 maturing out of such behavior.

</font>
<p>


I see your website as
interesting, funny, and truly anti-A.A. That is your aim.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well yeh. I think that feeding misinformation and cult religion to sick
people is really low and disgusting behavior.
</font>

<p>
If it works for me, it
works for me. A.A. works for me. A.A. will save my life, I know it. It will help
me, not hinder me. It will do for me that that I truly would of struggled for years
to do on my own, if at all.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but with your staggeringly huge 70 days of sobriety, it's a little early to be
deciding what works and what doesn't.
</font>
<p>


It takes alot of work from my part, faith, and above all,
surrendering to what has been proven to work in the lives to those close to me. I
will keep you guys up to date with my progress, with whatever questions you have,
for the remainder of my life.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but you are surrendering to what has been proven to NOT WORK.
</font>
<p>


I really want you to eat your stats, with the zero
recovery rate.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Not gonna happen. Those are true facts. They were even established by
 one of the leaders of Alcoholics Anonymous,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Doctor Professor George E. Vaillant</a>,
who is on the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous Services, Inc.
After nearly 20 years of shoving A.A. on his alcoholic patients, and
 8 years of testing A.A. and tracking his first 100 patients, Vaillant
 declared that A.A. was completely ineffective, with a zero-percent
improvement in the alcoholic patients.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">What A.A. really did was raise the death rate</a>
of his patients. The A.A.-treated group of patients had the highest death rate of any kind of treatment
that Dr. Vaillant studied.
</font>
<p>


If someone dies while I stay sober in A.A., its because that person
did not follow the program, and I did. A.A. is fatal.
<p>
<font color="blue">
&quot;Following the program&quot; is worthless. What matters is whether you quit drinking and stay quit.
<p>
<i><b>And WHAT is fatal?</b></i>
</font>
<p>


Alcoholism must be dealt with
day by day, seriously and with diligence. I will keep you posted with my progress
if you would like. If it works for me, I don't care if it doesn't work for most
alcoholics.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, 70 days is far to early for you to be declaring that &quot;it works&quot;.
Write back in 5 or 10 years, and tell me how the A.A. program worked out.
</font>
<p>

If I am sober and I can help others stay sober through my experience
and knowledge in A.A. as a I understand it, I will gladly stay in this cult and
live a happy, LONG, sober life.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a very big IF.
</font>
<p>

P.S.  I got one more request. To the main man, the 60 year old, take this
challenge. Have a beer today. Just one. But buy a twelve pack. Just have 11 beers
there while you drink your one beer. And tell us how it went. If you are powerless
over alcohol, you will drink the whole bunch and prove that A.A. has some truth to
it. If you are not, then you will just drink that one beer and effortlessly throw
the rest away. I just want you to try it.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Do you realize how despicable your challenge is? You want me to give up 6 years of sobriety and
risk readdiction and death just to amuse you? Why don't you also ask me to drink cyanide koolaid for you?
<p>
Is that what you call Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;spirituality&quot;?
<p>
Is that how you &quot;help&quot; other people to stay sober?
Invite them to drink themselves to death if they disagree with you?<br>
(Well, it's what Bill Wilson
wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>, isn't it? Tell them to go out and do some more research on the subject
if they disagreed with Bill and weren't willing to surrender to his cult?
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#our_brothers">See the <i>Big Book</i>, page 95.</a>)
</font>
<p>

I want you to prove to yourself your
great debate. I really believe you don't believe that you are powerless. If you
are an Alchoholic against A.A., then this little test will only prove one thing,
if you are right or wrong about your own sobriety and convictions. Test your six
years my good man, put your sobriety and life at risk to prove that A.A. steps and
traditions are lame.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You are completely twisting the meaning of the word &quot;powerless&quot;, and framing the
argument in an incorrect manner.
You are using the propaganda techniques of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#dichotomy">False Dichotomy</a> and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">The <i>Either/Or</i> Technique</a>
to try to make it a choice between
either being able to drink alcohol moderately, like an ordinary non-alcoholic person,
or else being &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
That isn't how it is. That is a false choice.

<p>
The reason that I abstain from drinking any alcohol whatsoever is because when I start drinking,
I fall in love with it and want more and more until I am readdicted and am in trouble.
When I abstain from drinking, I can stay sober for years with relative ease. That is not being
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<p>
Heck, I am very powerful and can decide whether to drink or not.
And I consciously, deliberately chose to not drink any more alcohol.
<p>
What Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> is that alcoholics are so powerless over alcohol that
they will just suddenly relapse and go on a binge because they think some silly thought like
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Maybe I could mix whiskey with milk and it will be okay.&quot;
</font>
Bill Wilson declared that sometimes you just cannot help but take that first drink, no matter
how much you wish to stay sober.
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#milk_whiskey">Look here</a>.)<br>
That was just Bill Wilson's repetition of
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane">Frank Buchman's cult doctrines</a>:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;You have been defeated by sin and are powerless over it. Only God can change human nature.
Only God has the power to defeat Demon Rum.&quot;</i></font><br>
That is all just another hook to get you to join the cult.

</font>
<p>


If you don't do this test, I don't blame you. I wouldn't do
it, for I would probably drink the whole lot, because I know I might. I'm an
alcoholic and the
taste of beer on my tongue and the alcohol hiting my brain would make me want to
drink more and I wouldn't want to risk it. Don't knock it till you try it. Tell us
how it goes old man.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I already tried the test you are talking about long ago, 15 years ago. I had 3 years of sobriety
when I thought that I could have just a beer or two at a friend's birthday party. I thought that I
had it under control because I had 3 years of sobriety, with no cheating whatsoever.
Alas, I went down the slippery slope very rapidly:<br>
<font color="#9F0000"><i>
<ul>
<li> &quot;If it's okay to have one beer, then two is okay.&quot;
<li> &quot;If two is okay, then so is three.&quot;
<li> &quot;Heck, just one six-pack won't hurt.&quot;
<li> &quot;I can drink as much as I want and have fun for a while...&quot;
</ul>
</i></font>
<p>
Nine years later a doctor told me to quit drinking or I would die.
<p>
That still is not &quot;powerlessness over alcohol&quot;. That is just readdiction to alcohol.
<p>
The thing is, when the doctor told me to choose between quitting drinking or dying, I chose to quit
drinking and live.
That was 6 years ago, and I am still quit. That is not being &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Alex C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: 6 years, on your own? Wow.<br>

<p>

I have great respect for you. You responded to my email and took time to defend your
point of view. A.A. might be corrupted, in fact I don't doubt it is corrupted.
That's what kept me from going to a meeting in the first place. I thought it was a
cult. Now I know it is. But it's not a cult that hurts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Alex,
<p>
Actually, the evidence says that it IS a cult that hurts. A.A. kills more alcoholics than it saves.

<p>
You are in good company in believing that A.A. is a beneficial cult.
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant is a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous
Services, Inc., and he also loves A.A. as a cult. He openly declares that A.A. is a cult religion,
but he thinks that it is such a wonderful cult religion that everybody should be forced to join it
so that they can be &quot;socially rehabilitated&quot;.
(<a href="orange-letters15.html#Vaillant2">Look here</a>.)
</font>
<p>

The God in A.A. is NOT
defined. I have never gotten into heated debate over it and I know I won't.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, the God of A.A. is most assuredly defined. The 12 Steps themselves
define <b>HIM</b> as a micro-managing tyrant who will meddle in the affairs
of this world and restore you to sanity in Step 2, and take care of your
will and your life for you in Step 3, and listen to your confessions in
Step 5, and remove your defects in Step 7, and talk to you in a s&eacute;ance
in Step 11 and give you work orders and the power to carry them out.
Those Steps explicitly describe a particular kind of God, one who is not
universal to all religions.
That is the God of Alcoholics Anonymous, not the God of Buddhism, Hinduism,
Judaism, Islam, or most branches of Christianity. That is pure
<a href="orange-rroot090.html">Buchmanism</a>.
</font>
<p>

Dwayne,
who has 4 years does not believe in a God whatsoever, nor Does Jim, who has 35
years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a simplistic attempt at
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote">Proof By Anecdote</a></i>.
That is bad logic. Two atheists don't prove that A.A. isn't a cult religion.

</font>
<p>

To counter act the childish, emotional, impulsive, and suicidal behavior of
the alcholic and many times alcoholic/narcotic man, A.A. works just fine if you let
it happen.

<p>
<font color="blue">
There is no evidence to support that statement. Show me the evidence.

</font>
<p>

I see your point where you have a choice, and you chose not to do it. It
took you a few years and a doctor telling you drink and die or stop and live to
stop.....if you are so smart and logical, why couldn't you stop before the tape came
sooner to the end then you liked? It takes a wake up call, not logic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is bad logic. Deciding to quit drinking is a process. It is a matter of drinking enough
and suffering enough for enough years
to get sick and tired of being sick and tired, and really become 100% convinced that the only
way to win the game is to not play it.
</font>
<p>


I had a wake
up call and I seeked help. I had many wake up calls, stayed sober for periods of
time, and went back.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it is a learning process.
</font>
<p>

A.A. works.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you offer no evidence that A.A. actually works.
</font>
<p>

It doesn't overpower my life, I go to 5 to 7
meetings a week and they don't request 10 percent of my earnings, and never have I
felt, Fuck, these people are insane.

<p>
<font color="blue">
5 to 7 meetings a week is an obsession. Get a life.
</font>
<p>


They are from everywalk of life, I included,
and I don't look like an alcoholic. In fact, anyone that knows me is shocked I am
one. I am an alcoholic, who has an abnormal reaction to alcohol. I am addicted to
alchohol and will always be because, I don't know how to put it, I drank myself
mentally into an alcoholic womb of comfort.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are not addicted to alcohol if you have 70 or more days of sobriety.
You have gone through withdrawal. It's over. Please learn what the words actually mean.
Alcoholics Anonymous does not get to redefine the language.
You are not addicted to alcohol now.
</font>
<p>


Sure, alcohol is a drug. So is crack. I
never used in my life, because I knew those heavy drugs get you addicted in a snap.
I didn't get addicted to alcohol with one beer, it is not the same as any hard drug
out there. It fools you. It's legal and it fools you into making you believe you
can drink responsibly.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I agree that alcohol is a very toxic and dangerous drug. In fact, I have used ALL of the heavy
drugs at some time or other, over the previous 40 years, including cocaine, heroin, and speed,
and guess what I got hooked on? Alcohol and tobacco.

</font>
<p>


I only gave you that hypothetical test to tell you that. I
believe you are powerless if you are to risk 6 years of sobriety with one beer.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No! I am not powerless. I am at risk of readdiction if I drink any more alcohol, yes,
but I am most assuredly not powerless over alcohol.
(Nor am I &quot;powerless&quot; over tobacco, heroin, cocaine,
speed, or any other intoxicating chemical.)
<p>
You just keep repeating that cult mantra as if it was some kind of true statement, as if it had
great meaning or wisdom, but it is nonsense. I am NOT POWERLESS over alcohol. I can hold it in my hand, look at it,
smell it, and then pour it out on the ground. I have done exactly that several times in the last 6 years.<br>
I am not powerless over alcohol. Neither are other alcoholics.
</font>
<p>


One
beer does not get you drunk, but it will help you get drunk. It takes one if you
are powerless. I see what you mean, that I am not powerless over alcohol, because
alcohol is a choice. I am powerless over alcohol if I take the choice.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is still nonsense. And that is not anything like what Bill Wilson wrote when he
declared that alcoholics were powerless over alcohol.

You stay
sober Orange. You will stay sober, without a doubt, because if you don't, then
there goes your theory of self knowledge and playing the tape forward, logic. I
have 74 days now.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your 74 days. Good going. Keep it up.
</font>
<p>


The reason why I point the fact of my age is because I have a
chance not fight, overthink, and struggle like so many people. I got a chance to
have a long, sober, happy life now, not later. I have surrendered into this cult of
sobriety, how bad is that? To promote sobriety.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, but that is the gotcha. Is it really a cult of sobriety? Do people who go to A.A.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">get sober in greater numbers</a>
than other people like me who quit drinking and stay sober alone, in their own way?
Even a leader of A.A. says, &quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">No. A.A. doesn't help.
A.A. is completely ineffective.</a>&quot;

</font>
<p>



And they have a system, and if I
was to look at it from your point of view, I Orange, I will have a website
dedicated to debunking A.A....no, I woulndn't. I would just be drunk and wait
till the doctor
told me I had a choice, if it comes to that, and how I value my life to save it. It
has nothing to do with logic. It's how much you care. You know, your stats are very
true. A.A. doesn't do a dent into the alcoholic masses. Suicide in A.A. occurs just
like out of A.A., because some people don't want to see another way, that is not
the A.A. way, it is the sober way of life. So people can't live without the drink
and in the face of relapsing, they do themselve in. You have to accept the fact
that as fucked up as A.A. is to you, it has help many, many people have sober,
sane, happy lifes.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, A.A. does not work. You keep trying to slide back into claiming that A.A. is a success that
has helped a lot of people when even A.A. Trustee Dr. Prof. George E. Vaillant declared that
A.A. was a total failure that just increased the death rate of alcoholics.

</font>
<p>

  
Where I go, Pacific Group, Downey, and Bellflower Big Book are
full of long term sober alcoholics.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are not looking at the whole picture. Dozens of sober old-timers don't offset the
thousands of disaster stories where A.A. failed to make the alcoholics quit drinking, or drove them
to suicide with the &quot;no medications&quot; nightmare.
<p>
And even thousands of success stories do not offset the millions of failure stories.
<p>
Besides which, you have not supplied any evidence that A.A. <i><b>MADE</b></i> those sober alcoholics
quit drinking. A.A. just steals the credit for anybody who quits drinking in the vicinity of an
A.A. meeting, no matter why the people really quit drinking. (And they have been doing that for a very
long time, too.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Philadelphia">Look here</a>
for them doing it in Philadelphia in the 1940s.)
<p>
Again, you are ignoring the reason <i>WHY</i> people quit drinking.
People quit drinking for quite a variety of reasons, like:
<ol>
<li> Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
<li> Don't want to lose marriage and children.
<li> Don't want to lose job and career.
<li> Don't want to lose everything.
<li> Doctor says I'm going to die if I don't quit drinking.
<li> Drinking is just ruining my life.
<li> I don't like how I act when I'm drunk.
<li> I want my self-respect back.
<li> I want my health back.
<li> I want my mind back.
<li> ...etc., etc., etc...
</ol>
... So people quit drinking for all of those reasons,
and then they visit a few A.A. meetings to see if A.A. has anything to offer, 
and then A.A. claims that those people quit drinking because of A.A. meetings
and the 12 Steps. That isn't true at all. A.A. is just stealing the credit.
<p>
Even if some A.A. member has been brainwashed into believing that he really did quit drinking
because of the A.A. &quot;program&quot;, and loudly testifies and gives testimonials about how A.A.
saved his life, that is still not valid evidence that A.A. actually works.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#quack_testimonials">Snake oil salesmen and quack healers
have been using testimonials</a>
since the dawn of time.
<p>
You have to look at the big picture and count all of the alcoholics, both the success stories and
the failures, when judging whether A.A. really works. When you accurately add up the numbers,
like how Dr. Vaillant did, it is clear that A.A. is
a complete failure. The actual A.A. success rate is the same as the success rate of alcoholics
who are left alone to do it their own way, without any &quot;help&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.
So A.A. does not improve the situation at all.

</font>
<p>

I plan to be one of them. And it's my life
outside of A.A. that proves that A.A. works. I will be a great man one day, and
A.A. is the start of my journey. And to clarify to you what a great man is to me,
that's the opposite of what I was before A.A., a lieing, cheating, dishonest,
immature,
bitter, resentful, no good leaching lazy alcoholic. I wasn't as bad as some people
but what I was was the worst person to be, because I knew how it was to be that
person.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on getting your life together. Now if you could just learn to be realistic
about numbers and success rates....
</font>
<p>

Ok, one last thing, if it works then no one cares what those who say it
doesn't work say.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a big IF. And since A.A. does not work, people do care about their loved ones getting harmed.

</font>
<p>


What works for you works for you, but believe me, some people
need A.A. to stay sober and if that person gives in and follows what is in front of
him, that man will be a happier person period.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is a groundless statement. Please show me the valid medical tests that show that
A.A. has helped such people and improved their rate of sobriety. The truth is that all of the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific">real tests of A.A.'s effectiveness</a>
have shown A.A. to be a failure that just makes things worse.
</font>
<p>

The day I feel that A.A. as a cult
is making my life worse then it was or if I feel that it won't be as great as it
would be on my own will, then it won't work for me. I don't see that happening
because the A.A. I know has given sons and daughters, mothers and fathers back to
their families as completely changed persons.....it works.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, I'm not buying it. A few people stop drinking and improve their lives, and then A.A.
steals the credit and crows,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Look how wonderful we are and look at what wonderful things we do.&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
And nobody in 
A.A. wants to talk about the sky-high failure rate, or the suicides, or the rapes and 13th-Stepping.
Read these two recent letters for some stories of how well A.A. has helped other people:
<a href="orange-letters79.html#tc_nightmare">Treatment nightmare</a>
and
<a href="orange-letters78.html#Q_group">Mike Q.'s Midtown Group</a>.
Also check out
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors">this horror story</a>. That is also the real Alcoholics Anonymous
experience.
</font>
<p>

Maybe I am just
fortunate to go to A.A. meetings in Los Angeles county, where there are over 3000
meetings every night and the sober capitol in the world when it comes to A.A. To
everything you
responded to as weak thinking and bullshit, you have to accept that it works to
many an alcoholic and that A.A. has saved the life of many.
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, it doesn't work and no, I don't have to accept your loose numbers as evidence of anything.
If you imagine that A.A. actually works, please tell me the answers to these questions:
<p>
<center>
<font color="#9F0000">
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many of them will pick up a ten-year coin
for sobriety?<br>
How about the 11-year coin? What percentage of the newcomers go on to get an 11-year coin?<br>
How many success stories are there really, out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A.?
<p>
How well does Alcoholics Anonymous <i>really</i> work?
</font>

<p>
Hint: the answers are
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
</center>

</font>
<p>


If the A.A. programs
helps you to stay sober and alive, and foremost, happy in the process, does it work
for you? I think you know the answer to that.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is nonsense. You try to fudge an IF into a declaration of success. Bad logic.
<p>
And you are
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume">assuming the major premise</a></i>.
You are assuming that A.A. makes people quit drinking
and live sober. There is no evidence that supports that statement. What A.A. actually does is
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">increase the rate of binge drinking</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">increase the rates of rearrests</a>,
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">increase the cost of hospitalization</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">increase the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
</ol>
That is not &quot;help&quot;.

</font>
<p>


And About my grand 74 days, I will
email you in five years and fill you in. I won't think much about it, believe me. I
will just write it in my to do list. Sober or not, I won't be afraid to email you.
I am not afraid to be what I am.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, I'll be waiting to hear how it's going. Good luck.
<p>
By the way, remember that it isn't just you that counts.
All of the alcoholics count. So keep track of about 100 of the other
newcomers who joined at the same time as you did, and see how many of them make it for 5 years.
(And remember that you have to count all of them. You can't start scratching the relapsers off of
the list because &quot;they didn't work the Steps right&quot;, or
&quot;they didn't <i>Keep Coming Back</i>&quot;. Either the A.A. program really worked to make them
quit drinking, or it didn't.)

Keep sober, and have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Jeffrey B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Dry Drunk Ramblings<br>

<p>

Dear A. Orange,

<p>

Just came across your site while searching &quot;dry drunk&quot;.  My wife has
been in AA for over 5 years now, sober for 2, yet preserves most of
the dysfunctional and destructive attitudes and behaviors she
exhibited while using.   In other words she's just as hard to deal
with as she ever was, maybe more so.  I'm trying to figure out how
she can reach true &quot;sobriety&quot;, which I guess is code for not being a
selfish, irresponsible asshole, as well as absence of substance abuse.

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
I am also put-off by the AA &quot;religion&quot;.  I haven't read everything
yet, but you make a compelling case for spontaneous remission by many
addicts.  I think this can be explained by two different populations
of users &#8212; those who had before using a fundamentally healthy
personality and those who had a fundamentally dysfunctional
personality.  By healthy I mean having  a well-inculcated ethical
system based on honesty, personal responsibility, accountability, and
self-esteem based on adherence to ethical principles.  Generally such
persons were truly loved and nurtured in childhood.  Such folks may
use due to trauma, stress, or just because they like it, and even
enter an addictive thought pattern of entitlement, resentment, etc.
But when the negative consequences become serious enough, they can
stop using and &quot;recover&quot; their original healthy thought and behavior
patterns fairly readily.

<p>

In contrast, the fundamentally dysfunctional folks, often raised by
generations of addicts, have never been responsible or accountable.
They were raised by self-absorbed irresponsible, untrustworthy people
who didn't nurture them or truly love them.  They were taught that
love means not being held responsible for one's behavior, that self-
esteem is based on what others think, that one gets one's needs met
through manipulation and deceit, that denial, rationalization, and
justification are the ways to deal with natural human failure (rather
than accountability).  When the consequences of using become serious
enough for these folks to stop, they have no healthy thought and
behavior patterns to &quot;recover&quot;, no foundation on which to build.
Everything they know is wrong.  They need a complete personality
rebuild, a step by step program to create an ethical system and
accountability to it, and for them, the AA cult (or something like
it) is necessary.   Of course very very few actually succeed in
overcoming powerfully impressed thought patterns from childhood.  A
person who is fundamentally healthy  does not need a new religion
just to stop drinking, and is put off by AA as you are.  But I think
the dysfunctional folks do need something that can make a fundamental
change in their life, and only something as powerful as a religion or
cult is going to work for them.  Make any sense?

<p>

Jeff

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jeff,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I think you are right on with your analysis of the personalities
of addicts. There really is a huge difference between those people who have
had a happy, stable, clean and sober
period of time in their lives and those people who have been stoned since puberty and who
have never learned to live straight. (I feel very lucky in that regard. I didn't start drinking
excessively until my thirties, so I had a good fall-back state of mind to go to when I quit
all of my bad habits.)

</blockquote>

<p>
Well, I agree that they need <i>something</i>, but unfortunately, the religion and cult routines
have totally failed. They have produced spectacular failures. The two largest and most
famous recovery cults of the
sixties to eighties were Synanon and the Peoples' Temple. Both were highly rated as very successful
drug and alcohol rehab programs. Both got awards and commendations from famous politicians and social
service organizations.

<p>
Chuck Dederich's Synanon degenerated into an insane commune where wife swapping and child abuse were
commonplace and a heavily-armed goon squad, the &quot;Imperial Marines&quot;,
attacked dissidents and defectors.
Then they put a rattlesnake in the mailbox of a lawyer who was suing them on behalf of ex-members
who had been abused. The rattlesnake's rattles were removed so that there would be no warning buzz
before the snake struck.
The guy nearly died. And they attacked the ex-member Phil Ritter, who had become disillusioned and
quit Synanon. They attacked him in the dark of night, from behind,
and smashed his skull with a baseball bat. He also nearly died.<br>
When the police came to arrest the leader, Chuck Dederich, he was so drunk that he couldn't walk.
They had to carry him out on a stretcher.<br>
More on Synanon <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Synanon">here</a>.
<p>
Jim Jones's <i>Peoples' Temple</i> was a &quot;Christian&quot; church
that ran the most successful and highly-rated
drug and alcohol rehab program in California (for a while). They were literally grabbing addicts
off of the streets of Oakland and San Francisco and getting them clean and straight.
<br>
The Los Angeles <i>Herald-Examiner</i> named Jim Jones the &quot;<i>Humanitarian of the
Year</i>&quot;. San Francisco Mayor George Moscone appointed Jim Jones
<b>Chairman of the San Francisco Housing Authority</b>.
Everybody agreed that the <i>Peoples' Temple</i> combination of religion and rehab was producing
magical results.<br>
Unfortunately, the magic went to Hell. Jim Jones went crazy and paranoid, and moved the church
to South America, to Guyana, where they all committed suicide &#8212; 914 men, women, children and babies,
all dead.<br>
More on the <i>Peoples' Temple</i> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#JimJones">here</a>

<p>
I have often asked myself whether there is some way to make a good recovery cult.
I've been to enough Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings to see the cultish energy
and spirit and <i>esprit de corps</i> and cameradery. And I've wondered whether that energy couldn't be used
to benefit alcoholics and addicts in some kind of good recovery cult. Unfortunately, the answer
seems to be that the cult structure itself is harmful and leads to abuses and disasters.
It seems that it always has so far.

<p>
Yes, those messed-up people really need <i>something</i>, but we've already tried religion and
recovery cults. We must do better in the future.
<p>
About your wife, I hate to say it, but a lot of what passes for alcoholism is really a pre-existing
condition. People are often messed up <i>before</i> they start drinking, not because of it.
Alcohol just makes things worse. And when those people quit drinking, they really do have to
deal with all of the stuff that was there before drinking. In fact, Alcoholics Anonymous says
much the same thing, but couches it in terms of &quot;spiritual defects&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, and
only offers A.A. as the solution. And A.A. doesn't work.
<p>
One of the biggest problems in medicine is the fact that psychiatry often just does not work.
Freudian psychoanalysis was an expensive hoax. Counseling is often useless. Modern psychiatry
can fix some schizophrenics with pills, and some other disorders with other medications, but
psychiatry is basically ineffective for a lot of conditions and character disorders
&#8212; like everything from extreme selfishness to addictive personalities.
<p>
I don't have any easy fix. I wish I did.
<p>
Have a good day.

Dear Orange,

<p>

I'm surprised at your reply to Jeff B.

<p>

Jeffrey B.'s  wife was in AA for 5 years and remained sober for only
2. She deserves our compassion and understanding, yet YOUR
understanding and compassion seem to be on the side of the husband
who calls his own wife selfish, irresponsible and an asshole.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Josie,
<p>
Yes, I did accept the husband's characterization of his wife at face value.
Everything else he had said made so much sense, I had no reason to believe that he was 
lying to me or crazy when he described his wife.
What if she really <i>is</i> like that, both drunk and sober?
<p>
That does not mean that I can't feel sorry for the wife, or appreciate her predicament.
<p>
And talking about compassion, what about the
suffering of the husband who has to live with her?
And who simply cannot fix her?
<p>
And cult religion hasn't fixed her, and psychiatry can't fix her...

From:  	Darien<br>
Subject:  	Help!<br>

<p>

I've been thankful for your website since I left AA. I was forced into  rehab
once; I knew something was wrong and your site clarified it for me.

<p>

I have spent a lot of money recently, and my parents are in financial
distress. They have decided to blame it entirely on me, and have determined (w/o
the input of a doctor or therapist) that I am an addict and they have taken
everything I have and threatened to throw me out on the street unless I  commit
myself to a rehab facility.

<p>

I'm over 18, and I recently left law school. My parents said I could return
home temporarily until I could get a job and find a place of my own in a
different city. But I was only here a week before they verbally, emotionally,  and
almost physically assaulted me, demanding I go to rehab, shouting rehab was
my only option, and that they would even call the police with a made up
offense to legally commit me to a rehab if I dont voluntarily go.

<p>

I've never been so terrified in my life. I don't believe in anything AA has
to say and I hate that my parents are using &quot;rehab&quot; as a place to  throw me
because they are angry. I don't drink heavily, but they seem to think  so. To
them, one drink is too many. They have also worked zealously to alienate  me
from my friends, who they consider &quot;enablers&quot;. When my friends told them I  had
no problem, they cursed them and told them they weren't true friends. I  think
my parents have been to Al-Anon and are in contact with other AA nuts  behind
my back.

<p>

Do I just go along with it? But I'm a college-educated, independent,
thinking individual who can not accept the mindless cult indoctrination of AA; I  am
even more frustrated when I question anything, I am met with a rebuke of &quot;not
being serious&quot; or showing &quot;addictive thinking&quot; (that's what a counselor  told
me when I asked if I could bring magazines to read; she said to read  only
the Big Book, which I think is crap). They also told me to leave all my
medication behind, even though it says never to miss a dose and they have been
prescribed by a psychiatrist.

<p>

I'm very, very scared. They said I am to be sent Friday. I'm so  scared.

<p>

&#8212;Darien

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Darien,
<p>
To answer your last question first, &quot;Should you go along with it?&quot;
I don't think so. 12-Step treatment isn't good for anything, it doesn't work, and
it just does more harm than good. Plus, as you say, 12-Step treatment is bullshit.
<p>
Two things really stand out:
<ol>
<li>
Contact your doctor immediately and tell him of this problem and see if he has any helpful
advice about how to prevent them from taking you off of your medications.
Perhaps he can telephone a judge and get an injunction or something.
Remember that your doctor is your ally and he has your best interests at heart, and he
should have some idea of how to keep you on your medications.

<li>
When your parents threaten to call the police and make a false report about you, they are threatening to
commit a crime. It is a serious offense to make a false report to the police.
(Remember that Martha Stewart went to jail for it.)
So protect yourself by calling the police yourself and telling them what is happening, and asking
for their help. Heck, even go to the police station and talk to them. You haven't done anything wrong,
so you have no need to fear them.
</ol>

<p>
I am not sure how old you are. &quot;Over 18&quot; means that you have reached the age of majority in
most states.
That is the age where you can do what you wish and they cannot order you around.
If you are (were) in law school, that makes you older than 18.
They cannot just shove you into a rehab facility against your wish. That is kidnapping and false
imprisonment. So you do not have to just go along with it.
If somebody tries to force you into a facility, make it clear that you will press charges for kidnapping
and false imprisonment.

<p>
Should they force you into some facility anyway, do not sign anything, no matter what, no matter how
innocent it may seem. If you start signing documents, the next thing you will know, you have given them
permission to &quot;treat&quot; you for as long as they wish,
and they aren't responsible for anything, and you will owe them $10 or $15 thousand for the
&quot;treatment&quot;.
So just don't sign anything.
And keep stressing the fact that you are being falsely imprisoned.
But hopefully it won't come to that.

<p>
That brings up a question: You say that your parents are in financial difficulties.
Well, those 12-Step rehab centers usually charge anything from $7500 to $40,000 for 28 days.
Payment must be made in advance. Where are your broke parents going to get that money?

<p>

Parts of your story are not clear. You say that you spent a lot of money recently, and apparently,
you spent too much because that left you without enough money to rent your own place.
You didn't say if it was your money or your parents' money.
If it wasn't your parents' money, it's hard to see how they could blame you for their financial
difficulties. If it was, then they have reason to be unhappy, but that does not make you an addict
unless you spent the money on drugs and alcohol.

<p>
Again, I would contact your doctor and get his help in sorting things out.
He will most assuredly want to keep you on your medications, and he will know whether you are
an alcoholic or addict. And if your doctor talks to the police, they will believe him before they
will believe either you or your parents.

<p>
I would strongly consider just getting out of there. Perhaps some kind of shelter can help you.
Again, ask your doctor for advice.

This is the &quot;best propaganda&quot; that Bob R. can produce after
25 years in the program?  Robert R. gave you his opinion.
What does that say about him??
It goes to show the unlimited growth potential of a veteran AA member.  A
regular Oracle.  I would really like for him to be MY sponsor!  A real gem.

<p>

What happened to your spiritual side Bob R.???  Live and Let Live, blah, blah,

<p>
Actually, the phrase is that opinions are like ass-holes, everybody has one
and they all stink!  I guess Bob R. just hasn't been paying attention for 25
years.

Subject:  	METANOIA<br>

<p>

Hi Orange
<p>
Steppers are continually captivated by their past memories (drinking stories) &amp; are
fascinated with the dead &amp; unchanging image of what it was like for them as
practising alcoholics. Why do they attend meetings? So they can hear the other Bill
&amp; Bob clones talk about the past &amp; stay in the land of the dead. 12 Step programmes
are the greatest horror story, because the Steppers have been so indoctrinated &#8212;
they aren't aware they are lifeless robots. They can do nothing to save themselves
while they continue to attend 12 Step meetings.
<p>
I have had a mutation of the mind
(METANOIA) &#8212; through the saving grace of Jesus Christ. Salvation is always the
ending of the mind's fascinated identification with the dead &amp; unchanging image of
what it was&quot;. It is the complete reversal of the &quot;natural&quot; order of things, a
METANOIA &#8212; the Greek word for repentance, meaning precisely a turning-around of
the mind, so that it no longer faces into the past, the land of the shadow of death,
but into the Eternal Present.
<p>
So long as the mind is captivated by memory, and really feels itself to be that
past image &#8212; which is &quot;I&quot;, it can do nothing to save itself; its sacrifices are of
no avail, &amp; its law gives no life&quot;.
<p>
Buchman, Wilson &amp; Smith have done an excellent job; Wilson talked to &quot;dead people&quot;
&amp; if you too want to talk to dead people, attend an AA meeting.
<p>
Peace Be With You<br>

LOL! I'm not a recovering alcoholic &#8212; I'm done with that. I have far too
many other concerns in life than to focus on old bad habits. If anything, I have
an addiction to reading the &quot;Orange Papers&quot; !!! I love your site and spend
far  too much time reading it. So now it seems the only trouble I have with
booze or  drugs (Non smoker now too) is the reminders and the wonderful
arguments and  twisted letters that I read on your site from those in defense of
something so  horrible to the human psyche, which is AA. LOL! Oh my my

<p>

Dear Orange:

<p>

A person may decide that they need a support group.

<p>

If that decision is taken:<br>
Investigate each group that is available.  Decide which groups which may fit you.<br>
Try several.

<p>

Please understand that this problem is one that is defined by the individual concerned.

<p>

Please understand that the solution is defined by the individual concerned.

<p>

That is, both the problem; and, the solution belong to the individual.  And, no one
else.

<p>

When the problem is solved, the individual is ready to &quot;graduate&quot; from the support
group.

<p>

When that realization comes to mind &#8212; the problem is solved &#8212; it is time to leave.

<p>

Then, just leave.

From:  	&quot;Beth&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>

Good Afternoon Orange,

<p>

Well documented site.  I have 15 years of continued sobriety and have attended a
good many meetings.  I am, one of the slower one's to truly hit a wall on how sick
this organization is.  When I am pulled to my knees to say a prayer, and not asked
what is really going on with me, it is frightening.  When I decide to use my
common sense and sit back and observe one particular meeting for three weeks and
can note the following, shaming, shunning, invalidatating, belittling and
abandoning behavior, on the part of the, &quot;fellowship.&quot;  I have to say to myself,
&quot;What the hell am I doing here?&quot;  Not to mention the non-stop perpetrator behavior
on the part of  those new to the AA and those that range in sober years from 15 to
over 30.

<p>

I am working my way out of this, (I truly have been entrenched, and at the service
level too, or enmeshed might be the better word).  Keeping my sanity through this
is no mean feat.

<p>

Mulling this over I wonder how far to go with AAWS, (letter), or the media.

<p>

I know you advocate for poltical action, which would not be my choice.  Any
thoughts on this?

<p>

My best,
<p>
Beth

<p>

PS If you choose to post this letter, please use the name Beth in the signature
line.  I am now involved with WFS and SOS, (transitioning), and do attend
meetings, women only, with care.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Beth,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. My first thoughts are about
<i>&quot;...use my common sense and sit back and observe one particular
meeting for three weeks...&quot;</i><br>
YES! Yes, yes, yes.<br>
That is the whole ball game. Once you see, when you really see, then it's a done deal.<br>
Once the little light bulb goes on in your head, it's all over now, Baby Blue....

<p>
You don't have to get involved in politics. Personally, I would prefer to not bother, either.
It's just that politics controls everything from all of the funding programs for 12-Step
&quot;treatment&quot;, which is done by the quacks at your local treatment centers, to the judge sentencing
people to A.A. meetings. It's all politics, and it would not be happening if the American people
knew what is really going on, and the Congressmen and Senators knew what is really going on,
or got told by enough voters.<br>
Politics is just a necessary evil &#8212; a tool for change.<br>
As long as the 12-Step empire uses politics to hand themselves more money, I have to get involved
in politics too.
<p>
Something else that you can do besides politics is just keep telling the truth about recovery
and the 12-Step routine. Just tell the truth to everybody in general. Now that doesn't mean that
you have to be like the Ancient Mariner with an albatross around his neck, compulsively telling
everybody your story, whether they want to hear it or not. But when the subject of recovery or
A.A. comes up, it's good to tell the truth. Just to counter-act the river of misinformation
that comes out of the A.A. propaganda machine.
<p>
And any letters that you want to write to media is a good thing. I don't think that a letter to
the AAWS headquarters will accomplish anything, though.
They stopped listening to the fellowship a long time ago.

<p>
And WFS and SOS sound good. I hear good things about them.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Reading your published papers<br>

<p>

Gday I have been reading your published papers online at orange .org

<p>

I have over the years had  differing success rate with staying away from booze
attending aa meetings

<p>

I have never truthfully felt  totally comfortable in meetings or happy with these so
called long-term sobriety people or 13 stepping  The anger i have experienced from
these people is terrible 'cause i had dared question their  honesty about how
truthful they really are about themselves or the programme they participate in.

<p>

If at any time i questioned or wasn't happy with cliches  giving to me by people
who were possibly more ill than i even though they had been off the booze longer,
[they acted like]
I was trying to tear the foundation of AA down.

<p>

That some members are treated with great reverence even though it states in the
books we are equals is something i could never stomach so well,
and the sickness of the 13th stepping i seen on young innocent women  who were so
ill they would have done anything to appease the men / women who were making
advances to them &#8212; the carrying on of sick behaviour.

<p>

I thank you very much for your articles and plan on reading them more  i
think i read somewhere you were a practising alkie for 20 years

<p>

I wish you well in all your endeavours

<p>

Hello Patrik, and Gday to you too, mate.
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the good wishes. I couldn't agree with your statements more.
<p>
You are basically right about me being &quot;a practicing alkie for 20 years&quot;.
I just have trouble counting the years exactly. Like I drank for more than 20 years, but in
the beginning it was normal, just a few beers now and then. But then the drinking
grew and became more
and more. So when did it cross the line into alcoholic drinking? Hard to say.
It was probably around the time that drinking 2 beers a night turned into 6 a night too often.
That would make it 17 or 18 years of excessive drinking. Oh well, whatever.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Orange<br>
I don't attend AA meetings anymore &#8212; thank God. I imagine leaving AA becomes more
difficult the longer one has been exposed to this evil, soul-destroying cult. In
one of your earlier postings I read with some sadness of a Stepper who wanted to
leave but found it difficult because AA was his whole life. One becomes trapped &amp;
I imagine most Steppers feel safe albeit quite isolated from the real world. I
imagine most Steppers don't have the guts to quit (AA) because of the
indoctrination (&quot;If you quit AA &#8212; You will drink&quot;).
<p>
My process (recovery) started
in 1994 (therapy, etc) but it took me many years to make a complete break from all
12 Step programmes (I was also going to SLAA, CODA, ACOA). I imagine most
alcoholics are terrified of intimacy (emotional cowards) &amp; attending 12 Step
programmes is the ultimate escape (from intimacy). I would suggest that quite a
few of the Steppers are  &quot;pussies&quot; &amp; people like yourself are more responsible &amp;
brave because your facing life
&quot;full on&quot; without the &quot;crutch&quot; of 12 Step programmes.

Hi again Micky,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. While I don't want to get into stereotyping A.A. members, I have to agree that
someone who is doing a meeting a day needs to get out and live in the real world.
Too many people use A.A. as an escape and a drug. And it does seem to be addicting, or at least
&quot;habit-forming&quot;.
