From:  	&quot;El Salvador&quot;<br>
Subject:  	An Online Work Steps or Die group..... I am out.<br>

<p>
First I received some real weird responses to my share on an online
&quot;recovery&quot; blog where one could state their opinion..I talked about a
Psychologist, member of AA, who once told me to stop taking my meds
and &quot;Work Steps go to more meetings&quot; a year later wound up in 2 mental
hospitals, finally properly dx ed and felt like the scum of the earth
when I returned to my home groups. I &quot;slipped&quot;!
<p>
Did not realize this a &quot;Work the Steps or Die&quot;,
and I am a bitter nasty
old dry drunk to them, huh? Think I have great sense of humor. Most
people like me. Again I learn to avoid toxic people, relax and let go.
I am not an &quot;AA basher&quot;, just that the Fellowship I knew for years, (I
don't use word &quot;program&quot; I am not a computer...nor robot) has radicaly
changed. I don't live in the USA any more, never was a &quot;puritan&quot; and
know in my own heart I am free. Often when I travel I attend Ex Pat
English language AA, to network with sober people, rather than being
alone in a bar.  Thanks

<p>
You keep up your good work... Did not send this reply to the online
group, wrote it for ME.
.
<p>
PS any of you zombie culties
members of the Midtown Group in DC? Just asking.

<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="green" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

The Fellowship... not &quot;Program&quot;... FELLOWSHIP OF MEN AND WOMEN.... in the
many tiny in membership, humongous in love and service International
English speaking AA and NA 12 Step meetings I attended overseas was
support I needed not only to stay sober and to COPE, not squawking
about what &quot;Step&quot; I was on or quoting from a BB. That's for some, not
for me. I am a people person &#8212; love, service, unity. I live in the
developing world, have been through wars, witnessed genocide, been to and
through Hell many times and made a U Turn, am still here, a survivor and
pain in the ass. Sober today.
<p>
Judge me, judge yourselves first and hope you never ever confront me
with any of your OWN bs face to face. Yep I got PTSD. Some of Vets,
most draftees were spit on and called Baby Killers when we came home.
Yeah, once in the worst part of L.A. some gang members gamme Shelter,
cuz I was a &quot;gringo&quot; who spoke Spanish and knew history and culture of
Mexico.

<p>
First of all, received that weird reply from some kind of pervert,
they try and Trigger you. I started out in &quot;AA&quot; 34 years ago and years
later, like many in recovery, moved on to alternative modalities,
asked questions, and continued to do service, including Medevacs in
rural conflict areas in Central America as a volunteer, driving
terminally ill disadvantaged persons with not a penny in their pocket
to hospitals and clinics. Babies were born in my vehicle, luckily
brought relatives who mids-wived along.
<p>
I and some other classmates
were abused by the same pediatrician on the early 1950s, the affair
was covered up, the doctor just asked to leave town.
I heard later and
after my symptoms started, as well as the others in our school &quot;group
of 5 sickies&quot; they called us. After my Dad found out, he went into a
depression and started drinking every night, taking out his issues on
me. My, Mom, an immigrant to US, her life saved by a Consul of El
Salvador in Europe during WW2, did not drink but had heavy emotional
issues when younger, raging temper one minute, loving the next.
<p>
I
attended an Ivy League University on partial scholarship in 1964-65,
however  dropped out, drinking, low self esteem issues, then got
drafted. Saw some combat. Abuse of alcohol and drugs stepped up.
Stateside, fell through cracks, homeless, live in Rehab. My former
counselors, great people, became my best friends. Two were Jewish, and
excuse me, we had that cultural bonding that can never exist with any
&quot;goy&quot; person. I picked up again, the progression was rapid, blackouts
and all that goes with blackouts, finally was arrested for dui when
clutch on my vehicle failed on a main street large city 1:30AM. I was
totally intoxicated.
<p>
Beginning of the end, into recovery via the
County Detox Centers. An employee, my age then 29, extended the hand
and my first &quot;Young Peoples&quot; meeting I was greeted at the door by Mel
F. and found out first I was not the only Jewish Alcoholic in the
world and in the meeting not the only one that had suffered and to
shut up, listen and keep coming back. Soon I got into service and
became very active there in New England and the next years in New York
City. No Internet, online, IM then, we were very relationship-oriented
and had long meetings after the meetings and yeah we took each others
inventory when required, and yeah we kicked ass or I had my ass kicked
(with tough love) when it was due, and then another day of sobriety
and O gotta lotta lotta days.
<p>
In my 3rd and 5th years of sobriety,
started to experience depression, anxiety, fears and manic episodes. Was

first told by a psychologist, also an AA member,
I &quot;did not require&quot;
any meds, to &quot;step up&quot; on my meetings, pray etc.
That &quot;AA&quot; so-called
mental health professional gave me bad advice.
<p>
Finally after 2
hospitalizations, homeless, worth nothing to nobody game again, found
a mentor working in Mental Health field &#8212; also an AA member, but from
the 20th Century &#8212; got me to NY Hospital, then to the Mental Health
Clinic downtowns. My advice from this AA mentor (No kiddies I AIN'T GOT
NO &quot;spawnsah&quot;): DO NOT TELL OTHERS IN AA MEETINGS YOU ARE TAKING
PRESCRIBED MEDS. However I told one &quot;friend&quot; who spread it around.
Except for a few members, two of them Atheists by the way, was shunned
by old home groups, sat in the back, they patted me on the shoulder
&quot;this too shall pass&quot; Well, I got better day by day, living in a
cubicle, Bowery Residence Program.
Once had &quot;sponsored&quot; many of those
guys, now was one of em and began with help of my psychologist, US
Citizen, native of Poland, was a Journalist in Africa many years and I
adopted as my path to recovery &quot;The 16 Steps of Empowerment&quot;

<p>
As an amateur historian I also have read as well as the AA BB and 12
and 12, all of the AA Conference approved books and literature, having
volunteered at AA World Services in NYC for a year as a bilingual
liason for Mexican and Central American groups interfacing with World
Services and escorting AA members on visits to the NY office.
Did my first 5th Step with Helen W. who worked many years for a salary
yes, but also in love and service?
<p>
Pretty good for a dry drunk, huh, kiddo? I guess you think I ain't got
no ESH to share. I am not sharing, I am renewing my own spirit, and as
well fending off you &quot;evil spirits&quot; who started all this nonsense when
I receive a very humiliating and idiotic response on this group from a
troll, who could or could not be sober who hides behind a puter.
Why I dished it out, stirring up the shit.. you asked for it and you got it!!!!

That's why I kicked butt virtually, if you can dish it out you'd
better be able to take it, cuz in both the recovery and real worlds
you got no guarantees.

I don't care what you think, what your &quot;program&quot; is, whether you pray
or not..I  don't care if you live or die, drink or drug, your choice

was suggested, never TOLD, to stop going to so many meetings and go to
work!!!!

<li>       &quot;Somebody injured you; that's why you spend so much time criticizing

<li>       &quot;Your posts and your website lead me to wonder why you spend so much
energy on this. Don't you have anything better to do than run down a

about AA?&quot;
<li>       &quot;That orange guy is getting really REALLY boring.&quot;

<li>       &quot;You've only paused your drinking, and never genuinely stopped.&quot;
<li>       &quot;You must be an agnostic or an atheist if you object to the

<p>
To end this epistle, YOU the detractors of course, you know far more
about your own sobriety and path to recovery than I do and vice versa.
<p>
Talk is cheap, I've walked the walk as best I could over the years and
since 1984 have been taking prescribed meds to manage my psychiatric
disorders, to cope and to hope. I neither hide in recovery rooms and
do not shy away from daily challenges presented by living in an often
insane real world. It is all about coping without illegal drugs or
booze or unprescribed pills. To you I am a &quot;bleeding deacon&quot;. So be it.
<p>
As for prayer, my people have been praying for 5,800 years, I know
when and where and how to Pray!
<p>
Some of us had the same problem on the online groups of
&quot;Lamplighters&quot;, some of us who fought and are emotionally or
physically crippled or both fighting for your freedom to respond to me
and vice versa. Most were Ex Pat US Vets, all are long gone from
&quot;Lamps&quot; and the Thumper moderators there.
<p>
The only &quot;meetings&quot; I wish to attend when in USA are the &quot;Town Hall&quot;
meetings and the Tea Parties and I will be in DC in spirit on 9/12.
<p>
If any of you are &quot;experts&quot; then go ahead and psychoanalyze me, and
others who feel and think like me, we are legion, we are recovering
alkies, addicts, gamblers, eating disorders, bipolar, PTSD, etc. and
also trusted &quot;normie&quot; friends who have EARNED our respect. I have been
spit on before, NEVER AGAIN: AA or not matters nothing to me, the
content of your character.
<p>
To end, ain't I some pathetic dry drunk??????? Shit, got a new handle!!!!!
HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR  LOL

&quot; i dont kick anyone off but why the fuck are you so bitter? you
commented here bro and got nasty. i appreciate your service to our
country but i dont see your point. what does it matter? lots of people
serve and mant died, that doesnt give one the right to be an asshole
to people they dont know. i dont care how much time you have or who
your sponsor is or who spoke where, your recovery is what you make of
is and what i see is an angry man. going from your posts you have
nothing i want brother so keep your recovery and however many years
you have.

<p>
by the way, my sponsor has 42 years of recovery. he was one of the
founders of NA in the washington dc area. he is also a well respected
christian minister but i dont throw that around because im not my
sponsor. he only teaches me, the old way. so before you judge others
take a good look at self.

<p>
again, nobody gets kicked off this page for getting nasty with me. i
can take it. get nasty with others and thats a different story.&quot;

<p>
Oh also by the way advise newcomers to avoid the 12 Step on line
Lamplighters User Group, if AA is the only resource available to them,
then at least f2f look into their eyes and read their body language,
if the group is either psychobabblers or overtly 'religious' at least
look for some individual members who will give support. Avoid those
wishing to sponsor you right away and if you are an attractive young
female you'll have &quot;AA men&quot; crawling all over you! If old and
unattractive they will hand you some literature and tell ya &quot;keep
coming back&quot;

Hello &quot;Salvador&quot;,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. It says a lot. Above all, congratulations on
making it. Still making it, in spite of everything.
When you come right down to it, we are still here.
<p>
I wish I could tell you that the anger will just fade out and go away
after a while, but I'm still fighting with old angers too. I'm still pissed off
at what was done to me 40 or 50 years ago. All I can do now is refuse to allow
old angers to dominate my life. When I find myself feeling anger and rage over
those old things, I just change the subject (in my head), and turn my
attention to something that is good, right here, right now, in &quot;real world&quot;.
It's a struggle. It's a battle. But it's worth winning, I think.
I don't want to waste any more time being angry about old history
that I cannot change.
<p>
That doesn't mean that I will ever forget. That is impossible. But I don't want
to let that old garbage waste any more of my time. Upwards and onwards.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life.

And now I just had another couple of anniversaries, again. Back in October,
I got 9 years off of drugs and alcohol, and just a few days ago, 9 years off of cigarettes
and tobacco. It feels good. What a relief to not be hungover or coughing.

<p>
And an interesting note: A Firefox plug-in called &quot;Xmarks&quot; is useful for
synchronizing your bookmarks between computers. Like it will combine your
bookmarks from your home computer and your laptop, so that the same things
are accessible from both machines. Well, I signed up for it, and discovered
that they rated the Orange Papers as number 8 in the category called
&quot;Serious&quot;. And it's like 30th in &quot;AA&quot;, 38th in the category of Addiction,
and #41 in Cults.

<p>
Dear Orange,
<p>
A friend recently turned me on to your site and I want to thank you for all of
your research and work.  My guess is that there must be a number of people out
there dealing with addictions who come across your site while searching the
internet for resources.  If you help just one avoid AA then I thank you for a job
well done.  I think your papers empower people who are looking for answers and
make them think twice about going to a 12 step group.
<p>
I quit drinking two years ago on my own and with the encouragement of friends,
family and a doctor. Happily my doctor does not promote AA and validated my own
belief that people can recover without ever attending a meeting or adopting a
spiritual practice.
<p>
Last winter I spoke with a co-worker who had been going to AA for his 90 meetings
in 90 days routine. I told him about my own experience and my reservations about
AA.  Apparently he spoke with his sponsor about our conversation and this alone
prompted a phone call to me from the sponsor.  The sponsor was angry and accused
me of &quot;interfering with &quot;John's&quot;  program&quot;  and that I could be responsible for
John leaving AA or having a slip.  I was taken aback by this guys audacity in
telling me I should not express my opinion to the man he sponsors.  I simply told
him to mind his own business and that I will express my objections to AA at will
and without consequences. He hung up on me. My co-worker is struggling with his
drinking and in my opinion AA is making his life more miserable.  I have
encouraged John to read the Orange Papers and to try some of the alternatives.
<p>
Thanks again for your wonderful website and give those sweet geese some bread for me.
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Gary

Hello Gary,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations on your sobriety
and recovery. And yes, the do-it-yourselfers are the majority of the successful
sober people, so you have every right to talk to your friend about what works,
and what doesn't.

<p>
Speaking of which, I hope your friend is doing well. I should point to the list
of discussions that we have had about what works, and what has helped people,

Perhaps he can find some useful information there.

Aloha,

I remember talking to someone calling themselves Apple a long time ago on 12

Hi Richard,
<p>
Thanks for the note.
And thanks for the story in Rebecca Fransway's book &quot;AA Horror Stories&quot;.
I read that book many years ago, and it was more fuel for the fire
 (my internal fire, that is).

<p>
You are right about the Apple&#8212;AA-Deprogramming connection, but I'm not Apple,
and Apple never ran the Orange Papers web site. Back in 2000 and 2001, when I was
just starting out, Apple ran the web site called <i>AAdeprogramming.com</i>.
  I sent the original
versions of some of my essays to her, and she put them online.
  I chose the name &quot;Orange&quot; so that we could
joke about mixing apples and oranges.

<p>
Apple retired from the scene, and I kept on writing, so my stuff evolved into a
web site of its own.

<p>
istj has forwarded you this craigslist.org posting.

<center><h2>
12 things to do at 12-Step Meetings
</h2></center>

<p>
<p>
Since most attendees at a 12-Step meeting are NOT there voluntarily (they need to
get some &quot;proof of attendance card&quot; signed!), I am offering THESE suggestions for
how to pass the time away, and maybe get that pesky &quot;proof of attendance card&quot;
signed a little faster too. . . .

<p>
<ul>
<p><li>
1.) Attend the meeting with a surgical mask on, and when asked, explain, &quot;I hear
there is a disease called &quot;alcoholism/addiction&quot; in here, and I don't want to catch
it!&quot;
<p><li>
2.) Offer a LOUD running commentary as the meeting leader begins the &quot;opening rituals&quot;
<p><li>
3.) If asked to leave, before getting your card signed, threaten to destroy the
coffee pot, and its contents, AND take the coffee!
<p><li>
4.) Repeatedly ask, &quot;Are we there yet&quot;?
<p><li>
5.) Inform those that have stopped drinking/using that they are hereby EXPELLED from
this and all future 12-Step meetings, as they no longer have a &quot;desire to stop
drinking/using&quot; (especially if they do not drink/use anymore!).
<p><li>
6.) Offer to set up a &quot;town hall meeting&quot; between the 12-Steps and the 12-traditions!
<p><li>
7.) Ask how many &quot;Big Book's&quot; it takes to make a good bonfire.
<p><li>
8.) Bring along your favorite intoxicating/impairing substance, and offer to share it with those having a &quot;birthday&quot;
<p><li>
9.) In NA meetings-&quot;leave behind&quot;/drop on the floor some cellophane wrapped rock
salt, with a clean, unused needle nearby.
<p><li>
10.) Pass out copies of federal court decisions that make it clear: a.) 12-Step
groups are religious, b.) you don't have to attend ONLY those, and c.) those
requiring 12-Step meeting attendance can be individually sued for their coercion.
<p><li>
11.) Ask questions! LOTS of questions! Demand specific, detailed answers (see #6!)
<p><li>
12.) Offer to do the &quot;Closing Prayer&quot; with: &quot;Holy Satan, prince of darkness, bless
this assemblage, and stop us from drinking/using in your holy name!  We all accept
thy's serenity and will&quot;!<br>
 BE VERY  SERIOUS HERE!<br>
 Instead of ending
 with &quot;Keep Coming Back&quot;! Try: &quot;GET THE FUCK OUT, LOSERS&quot;!

From:  	&quot;George C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Some comments about your site<br>

<p>
Hi Orange, you've got a lot of great information on your site.

<p>
I would like to suggest another question for your &quot;Cult Test Questions&quot;
page:

<p>
Can you get up and walk out of the room?

<p>
If the answer to the above question is &quot;yes&quot;, then I'm sorry, it is not a
cult.  Cults control people.  If someone who is free to leave at any time
ends up controlled, that is the fault of the individual, not the particular
philosophy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello ,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Sorry, but being kept prisoner in a room is not a standard cult characteristic.
Very, very few cults kept their people prisoners in an armed camp
 like how Jim Jones's <i>People's Temple</i> did.
In most cults, the people come and go as they please.  People are free to get up and
walk out of Scientology, the Moonies, Hari Krishnas, and Jehovah's Witnesses,
 and yet those things are all very much cults.
<p>
 The thing is, those people are not
<i>mentally free</i> to leave. They are victims of indoctrination and phobia
induction that makes them believe that they will die, or lose their
ticket to Heaven, or something
horrible will happen to them if they leave the cult. With Alcoholics Anonymous,
it is of course, &quot;If you leave A.A., your fate is jails, institutions, or death.&quot;

<p>
Cults do things like guilt induction, indoctrination, deceptive recruiting,
 phobia induction, teaching irrational dogma, constant put-downs, confession
sessions, enemy-making, isolation, two levels of information,
 and loaded language. A.A. does all of those things.

<p>
See
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>
 for a list of 100 standard cult characteristics.

<p>
A recent correspondent who was in A.A. for many years said that she rated A.A. on
that test and that A.A. was guilty of 97 out of the hundred.
</font>
<p>
I would like to call your attention to the following article, which I hope
you will like:

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160608203146/http://www.positiveatheism.org/rw/tradition.htm" target="_blank">
http://www.positiveatheism.org/rw/tradition.htm</a>

<p>
I think this article is spot on: Any attempt to use AA as a professional
treatment for alcoholism is wrong-headed, maybe criminal, and further is
prohibited by AA doctrine.  I don't know who these charlatans are that abuse
AA philosophy, but you are right to call them on it.

<p>
I especially like the description of AA from the article:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
12-step philosophy is not psychotherapy, counseling, or treatment for
substance abuse, or a rigorously researched model of applied psychology and
should not be utilized for such purposes. Twelve Step philosophy is just
that; a system of loosely organized beliefs which serve to bring together
lay people in a self-help/mutual-aid group, free of charge and as an
alternative to professional intervention. As such, it cannot properly be
professionalized, systematized, advertised, or engaged in for financial
profit.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once again, spot-on.  AA is a philosophy at the service of lay
adherents.  Considered
as such, it is as good a philosophy as any, and it was never intended &#8212; in
fact, was specifically prohibited &#8212; from being presented as anything else.  From
the BB, Forward to the First Edition:

<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 We would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an avocation.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<font color="blue">
The author there, Cliff Walker, the owner of the <i>Positive Atheism</i>
web site, was being too nice.
Yes, you can call
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">Buchmanism &#8212; the real A.A. religion</a>
&#8212; a &quot;philosophy&quot; if you
wish, but it is hardly just a service organization.  The core of Buchman's
religion is the belief that the best life consists of being a
slave of a &quot;Higher Power&quot;.
Every day, you conduct a s&eacute;ance and hear &quot;the Voice of God&quot;, supposedly
telling you what to do, and giving you the power to carry out the orders of
the voices in your head. That is A.A. Step 11.
<p>
Buchman also declared that you were too stupid to think for yourself,
so you should have a sponsor or F&uuml;hrer doing your thinking for you,
and telling you what to do.
And Buchman declared that you are so flawed that you cannot ever be
cured or fixed &#8212; you have been &quot;defeated by sin&quot;
(like &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;) &#8212; and
the only thing you can do with your life is
surrender to a &quot;Higher Power&quot; and hope that &quot;Higher Power&quot; makes
you into a good little puppet.
<p>
Does any of that sound familiar? It should, because it's in the 12 Steps.

<p>
And then it gets worse. While a few people do go to A.A. meetings to be of service,
lots more do not. Others use A.A. as a meat market, to pick up on the new women
who show up. See <a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">the
Midtown Group</a> for much more on that.
<p>
And then there are the old-timer ego-trippers, enjoying being a big frog in a small
pond. And then there are the people who are just afraid to leave, because they have
been told that they will die if they do. And then there
are the people who are obsessed with A.A., and who have to go to one or two or three A.A. meetings
per day or else they freak out. And then there are the sponsors, looking for new
slaves. And then there are the neurotics and the psychotics and the religious fanatics.
And then there are the criminals who are forced to be there by the courts and parole officers.
<p>
And on and on.
That is not a good crowd to ask for life advice.
<p>
Of course I totally agree that Buchmanism should not be packaged and sold as
a quack cure for alcoholism and addictions.
The treatment centers that sell 12-Step programs as a cure
for drug and alcohol problems should get sued out of
existence, and put in prison for fraud and criminally negligent homocide. 
<p>
By the way, in spite of the fact that Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that 
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an avocation&quot;</font>,
 he actually became a millionaire by selling it. He never had to work a straight
job again. (It was just <i>the other people</i> who weren't supposed to get a share
of the money.)
</font>
<p>
In any case, you throw around that &quot;cult&quot; insult a lot, and I do not think
you are justified in doing so.  AA does no recruiting, charges no dues, and
never pursues people who leave the fellowship.  By your metrics, the local
elementary school is more of a cult than AA.  I agree completely with your
criticism as it applies to professional practitioners.
<a name="disservice"> </a>
  However, I think
that your criticism of AA overall is not helpful, in that it gives the
alcoholic a very authoritative-appearing excuse to avoid AA and continue
drinking.  *&quot;See?  AA is a cult! I can't get involved in that!&quot;*

<p>
<font color="blue">
I think I am very justified in calling A.A. a cult. Again, read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>
and see the list of standard cult characteristics.
And then compare that list to Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Your claim that the local school is a cult is based on a gross misunderstanding
of what a cult is and how they work.
You obviously have not bothered to actually read &quot;my metrics&quot;, or else
you quickly forgot them.

<p>
And once again, there is the veiled accusation that I am hurting alcoholics by telling
the truth about A.A., and maybe discouraging someone from going to Alcoholics
Anonymous. That is such a
<a href="orange-letters128.html#disservice" target="_blank">standard A.A. accusation</a>.
But I get a lot of letters from other people who say that I helped them by telling the truth.
</font>
<p>
On your site, you misuse
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">the Harvard study</a>
repeatedly, thus: &quot;80% of all
alcoholics who quit do so on their own.&quot;  That statement implies a blatant
falsehood, one that you, with all of your emphasis on evidence, should be
ashamed to repeat.  In fact, as your statistics show, most alcoholics do not
quit, but rather *die of their disease*.  The truth of the matter puts quite
a different moral emphasis on your repeated misrepresentation of the facts.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What blatant falsehood? Now you know more about medicine than the Harvard Medical School?
What are your sources of information? Let's see the hard evidence.
Where do you get the idea that the Harvard Medical School is wrong about addictions?
<p>
And &quot;my statistics&quot; do not show that most alcoholics die
of &quot;the disease&quot;. Where? What are you supposedly quoting?
I said that slightly more than 50% of the alcoholics recover,
and 80% of those recovered people did
it alone, on their own. And that's just what the Harvard Mental Health Letter said.

<p>
Since you seem to think that A.A. cures alcoholics, let's see the facts. Let's see
some numbers.  Once again, it's time for the question that A.A. members have never
answered honestly:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later?<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">here</a>.)
</font>
<p>
Finally, I have read your page on &quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html">The Lizard Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;, and
I must say that, from my own perspective, I have never read such a risible
load of claptrap in my life.  I am delighted that such nonsense worked for
you, but it never would have worked for me, and your notion that this
approach is more rational or workable than the AA approach is simply
unsupportable and merely your own prejudice talking.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Obviously, listening to your own mind, and recognizing thoughts, is not your strong suit.
<p>
But other people who do &quot;get it&quot; have said that the knowledge was a big help
to them in staying sober.
</font>

<p>
Perhaps my opinion makes you consider me a &quot;sheep&quot;.  Perhaps you are right,
but I have no need to argue the point.  In any case, I have found a lot of
value in AA, certainly no harm, and I resent the fact that you call me a
cultist merely because of my religious beliefs.  Your view is prejudiced,
and in my opinion, more likely to harm alcoholics than help.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Sorry if your feelings are hurt by my calling A.A. a cult, but it's the truth.
<p>
And once again, there is the veiled accusation that I am hurting alcoholics by telling
the truth about A.A.
</font>
<p>
Thank you for your time and have a great day.

Hello Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the tip.  I've only read a little bit of that so far, but I'm getting
the impression that they are selling the same idea as Scientology does: that memories
of old injuries cause insanity and limit your powers and abilities, and if
your old memories are somehow &quot;processed&quot; so that you are desensitized
to them, then you will become something greater.

<p>
That's quite an assumption. Personally, I've never found dwelling on old negative
memories to be beneficial.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hi Terry,

<p>
I have Fingarette's book here in front of me. Chapter 2 is titled &quot;Can Alcoholics
Control their Drinking&quot;. He cites:
<ul>
<li> Merry, &quot;The 'Loss of Control' Myth&quot; (1966)
<li> Heather and Robertson, Controlled Drinking (1981)
<li> Donovan and Marlatt, &quot;Assessment of Expectancies and Behavior Associated with Alcohol Consumption&quot; (1980)
</ul>
as disproving the myth.

<p>
The studies were Mello and Mendelson, &quot;Drinking Patterns During Work-contingent and
Non-contingent Alcohol Acquisition (1972); Mendelson, &quot;Experimentally Induced
Chronic Intoxication and Withdrawal in Alcoholics&quot; (1964)

<p>
He also says to see:

<p>
Gottheil et al., &quot;Fixed-Interval Drinking Decisions&quot; (1972); Cohen et al.
&quot;Alcoholism: Controlled Drinking and Incentives for Abstinence&quot; (1971a) and
&quot;Moderate Drinking by Chronic Alcoholics&quot; (1971b)

<p>
Others are mentioned and cited, these seem to be the big guns.

Hi again, Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the information. I find it rather amazing how the powers that be
can ignore such findings for so long, and continue to parrot the same old
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; fairy tale.

<p>
I just got Fingarette's book through an inter-library loan. And now I have to read
it, along with all of the other things on my reading list.

Subject:  	Don't drink that marshmallow<br>

<p>
Another study on delayed gratification.

<p>
Don't drink that marshmallow

<p>
The marshmallow experiments are famous by now, thanks in large part to
Daniel Goleman's <i>Emotional Intelligence</i> books, and their relevance to
addiction seems obvious. In 1968, Stanford psychology prof Walter
Mischel presented four-year olds with a marshmallow and the choice: Eat
it now, or wait 15 minutes and get two. The kids who could delay the
gratification ended up, a decade and more later, with higher SAT
scores, higher graduation rates, better jobs &#8212; in short, twice as many
of the marshmallows life had to offer. 

<p>
It was
often believed that the kids who could delay gratification did so
thanks to more &quot;will power.&quot; Mischel &#8212; according to a helpful and
informative summary in this week's New Yorker,
by Jonah Lehrer &#8212; analyzed what this &quot;will power&quot; really consisted of.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

He paid very careful attention to what went through the delaying kids'
minds as they resisted the bait. They succeeded because they had
methods of distracting their minds from the lure. They covered their
eyes, or played hide-and-seek under the desk, or sang songs. &quot;Their
desire wasn't defeated &#8212; it was merely forgotten.&quot; The key, Mischel
found, was not to resist the marshmallow &#8212; that didn't work &#8212; but to
avoid thinking about it.

<p>
In further
experiments, Mischel found that children could be taught cognitive
tricks that helped them distract themselves. &quot;Even reducing the
intensity of the temptation by pretending that the marshmallow was only
a picture of a marshmallow or that the marshmallow was really a cloud
worked for some children.&quot;

<p>
Mischel and other
researchers Lehrer quotes are skeptical of finding a genetic basis for
the ability to delay gratification. &quot;Too many genes are involved in
even the simplest aspects of personality. &quot;The cutting edge of research
lies in classroom curricula that teach self-distraction, and in
educating parents to cultivate simple cognitive skills in children.&quot;
<p>
Says Mischel: &quot;We should give mashmallows to
every kindergartner... We should say, 'You see this marshmallow &#8212; You
don't have to eat it. You can wait. Here's how.'&quot;

Wow. &quot;Cognitive tricks&quot;. It looks like cognitive behavioral therapy strikes again.

<p>
The obvious implication is that some alcoholics could be taught similar cognitive
tricks to delay or avoid drinking, or more particularly, excessive drinking and drunkenness.
<p>
Thanks again for the input, and have a good day.

Hi Orange

<p>
Re: The British Secret Service (MI5) investigating The Oxford Group/Moral

<p>
Wow, seems like the British government really took quite an interest in the
pro-Nazi stance of the Oxford Group!

<p>
Did you know about this?

<p>
Best regards

Hi Gary,
<p>
Thanks for the link. No, I didn't know about that. That is very interesting. Now I'd like to
get my hands on the whole report. Perhaps some British citizens know how to get documents from
their government?

<p>
Have a good day.
