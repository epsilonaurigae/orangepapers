<p><br><li>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Charles Bufe<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731, 1998.<br>
ISBN: 1-884365-12-4<br>
Dewey: 362.29286 B929a 1998<br>
This book is an eye-opener. One of the first to tell the truth
about A.A..<br>
(This is the second edition; it has noticeably more information
than the first edition. The first edition is: ISBN 0-9613289-3-2,
printed in 1991.)<br>
This book is now free on the Internet, at:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103221622/http://www.morerevealed.com/" target="_blank">http://www.morerevealed.com/</a><br>
(And you can also get Ken Ragge's books, <i>The Real AA</i>, and
<i>More Revealed</i>, there.)

<p><br><li>
<i>A History of Addiction &amp; Recovery in the United States</i>,
Michael Lemanski<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731, 2001.<br>
ISBN: 1-884365-26-4<br>
Dewey: 362.29180973 or 362.2918 L547h<br>
Also from See Sharp Press, another excellent critical analysis
of the whole recovery industry, including A.A., treatment centers,
and &quot;codependency therapy&quot;.<br>
Quotes:
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Lemanski" target="_blank">Mental health in A.A.</a>


<p><br><li>
<i>Addiction, Change &amp; Choice; The New View of Alcoholism</i>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Vince Fox, M.Ed. CRREd.<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731, 1993.<br>
ISBN: 0-9613289-7-5<br>
Dewey: 362.29286i FOX<br>
And yet another great book from the See Sharp Press.
Fox covers:
<ol>
<li> Heavy Drinking: Its Historical Context
<li> Alcoholism: Definitions &amp; Opinions
<li> Polarization: Us vs. Them
<li> The Objective: Personal Autonomy
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Essence &amp; Functions
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Effectiveness
<li> The Forces &amp; Directions of Change
<li> The Independent Self-Help Programs
<li> Rational Recovery Systems Network
<li> Traditional Recovery Management
<li> Nontraditional Recovery Management
<li> Noninstitutional Recovery
<li> ...and more...
</ol>
One of the things I like best is how Fox stresses just
how damaging and dangerous it is for A.A. and N.A. to teach
addicts that they are powerless over alcohol or their addiction, and
have no choice in the matter. That is a ready-made rationalization
for a drunkard to have another drink, or a doper to shoot up again.
And that is what the steppers do.
Fox also does a good job of criticizing the arrogant
<i>&quot;My way or the highway&quot;</i>
attitude of self-righteous A.A. and N.A. sponsors.

See Sharp Press, Tucson, AZ, 2000.<br>

More truth from the See Sharp Press &#8212; how to resist being coerced into the 12-Step cult.<br>

LCCN: 90-56435<br>
Dewey: 616.86'06&#8212;dc20 or 616.8606 K19m<br>
This book is excellent. It definitely ends up in the Top 10 List of books
that you must read if you are thinking about quitting (or perhaps if
a loved one is trying to quit, or needs to quit).<br>
She covers addiction and alcoholism from a lot of different viewpoints,
including the need for improved nutrition and getting off of other
addictions like nicotine, caffeine, or TV.<br>
She is about the only one who addresses the issue of the narcissism
inherent in A.A., which it got from
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">the champion narcissist, Bill Wilson</a>.
(Pages 153-154.) She is also the only one to talk about <i>Candida
Albicans</i>, a potentially-devastating yeast infection, in connection
with alcoholism. Something that A.A. all too often fails to consider
is that people kill their pain with alcohol because they are sick and
in pain, not because they are sinful.
Ms. Kasl has the brains to realize this.<br>
She also covers recovery from the woman's viewpoint better than
anybody else I've seen. This book is simply <i>Must</i> reading for
women alcoholics and addicts.<br>
She also has a good take on the inherently-patriarchal attitudes of
A.A., and the fallacies of codependency.
An example of her perceptiveness:
As a counselor and therapist who has had to repair a lot of
refugees from A.A. and 12-Step programs, she has a lot
to say about things like<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>&quot;How to violate other people's boundaries with:&quot;</i>
<ul>
<li> Slogans

(Tell somebody whose mother just died: <i>&quot;God never
gives you more than you can handle. Don't feel sorry for yourself.
Get outside of yourself. Stuff your feelings.
Don't dredge up the past. Take responsibility. Get off the pity pot.
Let Go and Let God.&quot;</i>)
</font>
<li> Giving unsolicited advice.
<li> Hugging members of the group without permission.
<li> Assuming friendship on the part of another member.
<li> Not accepting a member's saying &quot;no&quot; to phone calls,
socializing, and so on.
<li> Trying to get a new member to talk.
<li> Preaching.
<li> Flirting with a group member.
<li> Seducing a group member.
<li> Telling sexist or racist jokes.
<li> Bringing sex into the conversation.
<li> Coming to group with the intent of finding a date rather than
a sincere interest in personal growth.
<li> Disclosing lots of personal information without taking time to
create a friendship or find out if the person wants to listen to you.
</ul>
</font>
(Pages 218-222 and 239-240.)
<p>
Her list of the characteristics of unhealthy groups is:
<font color="blue">
<ol>
<li> The group discourages or blocks outside involvement.
<li> The group limits or discourages access to reading material or
other forms of personal growth.
<li> Expression of dissension is punished, squelched, or strongly
discouraged.
<li> The group becomes grandiose in its self-definition &#8212; &quot;Ours
is the one way, the road to salvation.&quot;
<li> People get locked into stereotyped roles.
<li> The group becomes paranoid about outsiders or those who
question the norm.
<li> People talk like robots.
<li> In-group jargon predominates in conversations.
<li> The group exerts pressure on people to stay.
<li> People use the group for sexual needs.
<li> The group is unable to reflect on itself, its history, and
its values from a broad perspective.

This is a lot of good sensible advice. Dr. Ellis is the creator of
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), which is the foundation of SMART
(Self Management and Recovery Training).  &#8212; And he's also the founder
of SMART. If you are looking for some realistic, rational, non-superstitious,
common-sense, help in quitting drinking, definitely read this book.
It includes chapters on:
<ul>
<li> &quot;But therapy doesn't work!&quot;
<li> Denial.
<li> How to stop self-defeating BS (stinking thinking).
<li> How to change your stinking thinking.
<li> Integrating rational ideas into your self-help work.

<i>How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me;
 My Personal Journey to Sobriety Through Self-Empowerment</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp;
Marianne Gilliam<br>
Eagle Brook, an Imprint of William Morrow and Company, Inc.,
New York, 1998.<br>
ISBN 0-688-15587-1<br>
LC: HV5293.G55A3 1998<br>
LCCN: 97-37092<br>
Dewey: 362.29286'092&#8212;dc21 or 362.2928 G481h 1998<br>
In spite of its negative title, this is actually a very positive book.
This is one of the best-looking &quot;alternatives to
A.A.&quot; kind of books that I've seen (from my biased viewpoint, of course).
It definitely contains a very strong
flavor of spirituality, but without the cult religion aspect.
This is a good &quot;something&quot; for those who try to take the middle road,
for those who try to be spiritual but sensible,
for those who want something other than either atheism or blind
faith in cult religion.
<br>
For example:
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...the Love that binds the Universe together gently encourages me to
go even where there is intolerance, hatred, and anger. For Love wisely
knows that to go there in peace and acceptance will literally
transform these negative traits into Love itself.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There can only be duality of good and evil, right and wrong, love and
fear at the lower levels of awareness. For at the highest levels,
there is only Love. Love sends itself out and returns to itself.
All the world is a journey in which love seeks to go where it is not
and heal itself. We can each do this individually with our own lives
and our own physical bodies. To go where love is not, fully supported
by the Universe, we heal.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
Bill Wilson had a bad habit of
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#prejudice" target="_blank">accusing everyone who didn't buy his
peculiar Buchmanite religious beliefs</a> of being an atheist.
This book is a good answer to that.<br>
It also contains chapters on Food and Cigarettes, Fear and Dependency,
The Nature of Addiction, The Role of Ritual, Pleasure and Guilt,
Finding My Inner God, and much more.<br>
If you are looking for an alternative to the A.A. philosophy, then
definitely check this book out.

LCCN: 99-6526<br>
An excellent book that tells it straight. Dispenses with the myths about recovery,
the disease theory, and the slogans about &quot;Nobody can do it alone&quot;, and describes
how a lot of people do in fact recover from addictions on their own, without treatment.

This book will curl your hair. One fair-minded 12-Stepper suggested that
every new member should be issued copies of both the <i>Big Book</i> and
this book when he or she walks in the door,
to tell the newcomers about both
the good and bad things that could happen to them in &quot;the rooms.&quot;
One of the most disturbing repeated themes is women who were the victims
of rape or thirteenth-stepping being told to just shut up and find their
part in it and go make some coffee, and to not harbor any resentments
against their attackers.

<i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-Step Programs</i>

Prometheus Books, Buffalo, NY, 1992.<br>
ISBN 0-87975-726-4<br>
Dewey call number 362.2928 C556s<br>
This book is about
Secular Organizations for Sobriety (SOS) a.k.a. &quot;Save Our Selves&quot;.
SOS is an alternative recovery method for those alcoholics or drug
addicts who are uncomfortable with the pseudo-spiritual and superstitious content of widely
available 12-Step programs. SOS takes a reasonable, secular approach
to recovery and maintains that sobriety is a separate issue from
religion or spirituality. SOS credits the individual for achieving and
maintaining his or her own sobriety, without reliance on any &quot;Higher
Power.&quot; SOS respects recovery in any form regardless of the path by
which it is achieved. It is not opposed to or in competition with any
other recovery programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Especially check out the interview with Dr. Kenneth Blum, titled
&quot;The Fickle Gene&quot;. Dr. Blum discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcoholism, and perhaps also a
tendency towards drug addiction.<br>

ISBN 0-440-50725-1<br>
Dewey call number 362.2918 T831s<br>
This was one of the original calls to war against the Evil Empire
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
Note that Jack Trimpey has declared this book obsolete, and says
that you should just read the next one, &quot;Rational Recovery.&quot;
The funny thing is, I don't find it to be obsolete.
Trimpey borrowed some techniques from Doctors Maultsby and
Ellis like the ABCs of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and
did a good job of explaining them.
Trimpey did a good job of collecting a variety of
tools for quitting drinking and staying quit and working
them together into a fair toolkit.
This book does what A.A. only claims to do &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#tools" target="_blank">give you
the tools you will need to maintain sobriety</a>".

Pocket Books, 1996<br>

Dewey call number 362.2918 T831r<br>
This is Trimpey's second book about quitting drinking (or other addictions)
using rational techniques. He changed his mind about a
lot of things and decided that you only need one technique
to defeat cravings &#8212; the ability to recognize and dispute
the Addictive Voice as it cajoles, wheedles, and seduces
you into having &quot;just one&quot;.
This book is worth reading just for the chapter in the back that
<a href="orange-addmonst.html#so_depressed" target="_blank">describes a counselling session</a>
where Trimpey exposes &quot;the Beast&quot;,
the addiction monster that tries to con us into drinking or
using again (really, the
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">base brain craving mechanism</a>).
Also see the chapter on &quot;Beasts in Love&quot; &#8212; &quot;Beasts don't
fall in love; they just form partnerships to help feed their appetites.&quot;
Really must reading.<br>

<i>Controlling Your Drinking: Tools to Make Moderation Work for You</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; William R. Miller and Ricardo F. Mu&ntilde;oz, PhD<br>
Prof. William R. Miller, of the Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions, Dept. of Psychology,
University of New Mexico, could have written a scholarly tome on alcohol abuse
(and in fact, he has written several), but this book is non-technical and is aimed at the layman.
That is, it is written in simple, clear, easily-understood language and is intended
for someone with a problem controlling their drinking.
It is very systematic and complete, and loaded with good advice and working techniques,
and should be helpful to anyone who is drinking too much, no matter whether
he ends up choosing moderation or complete abstinence.
This book will do what A.A. falsely claims to do: Give you the tools you need to stop
(or moderate) drinking.
This book includes:<br>
<ol>
<li> Keeping track
<li> Taking charge
<li> Slowing down
<li> Discovering your triggers
<li> Relaxing
<li> Visual techniques for relaxing
<li> Managing anxiety and fear
<li> Coping with negative moods and depression
<li> Managing a positive self-concept
<li> When abstinence seems like the best choice for you

This book is a blockbuster. It is must reading for anyone in the
alcoholism or addictions treatment or rehabilitation field.
It details a lot of the selling of the standard recovery myths,
like selling the idea of codependency and turning its treatment
into an industry, and &quot;recovering&quot; false memories,
and &quot;reparenting&quot;, and more.
He describes &quot;Codependency&quot; as invent a non-existent disease, and then
charge a fortune to treat it.
And one chapter title is priceless: <i>The Metastasizing of Metaphor</i>.

An interesting expos&eacute; of Alcoholics Anonymous, coming from both
a scientific and biblical point of view:
<i>&quot;The real truth from the Bible and science about addictions and
codependence &#8212; and how you can be free of them!&quot;</i><br>
In spite of its very unusual approach, this book makes a lot of good
points, and clearly shows that A.A. dogma is false both from a medical
and theological viewpoint, as in:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The irony of a Twelve Step program customized for Christians is that many
who use it believe it is not only effective but Biblical.
... If the original Twelve Step program needs to be &quot;adapted&quot; for
Christians, it seems odd to say that it is &quot;Biblically based.&quot;
What kind of double talk is going on here? Unfortunately, this kind of
confusion is characteristic of the literature of &quot;Christianized&quot;
recovery programs.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After all is said and done, Christians do not seem to be making the recovery
industry approach more compatible with Biblical Christianity. On the contrary,
the recovery industry seems to be influencing the Christian approach.<br>

LCCN: 84-19319<br>
Dewey: 616.8606<br>
Great stuff. A huge amount of true information about alcoholism
and relapse prevention. Rather scholarly and heavy going;
written for professional therapists and counselors rather
than for the average alcoholic.<br>
Recommended. Chapters are:
<ul>
<li> Part 1. Relapse Prevention: General Overview
<ul>
<li> Chapter 1. Relapse Prevention: Theoretical and Overview of the Model
<li> Chapter 2. Situational Determinants of Relapse and Skill-Training
Interviews
<li> Chapter 3. Cognitive Factors in the Relapse Process
<li> Chapter 4. Cognitive Assessment and Intervention Procedures
for Relapse Prevention.
<li> Chapter 5. Lifestyle Modification
</ul>
<li> Part 2. Applications with Specific Addictive Behaviors
<ul>
<li> Chapter 6. Alcoholic Relapse Prevention and Intervention:
Models and Methods
<li> Chapter 7. The Problem Drinker's Project: A Programmatic
Application of Social-Learning-Based Treatment
<li> Chapter 8. Preventing Relapse in Ex-Smokers: A Self-Management
Approach
</ul>
</ul>
G. Alan Marlatt wrote the first five chapters, and a variety
of other authorities and experts wrote the following four.
The authors are quite specific in their descriptions of
tools and techniques that work to help people avoid relapsing,
and that is the greatest value of this book (to me, at least).

Excellent, recommended.
A lot of good, true, information, including information on
controlled drinking as opposed to absolute abstinence.
Includes chapters on:
<ul>
<li> The Rand Report and the Alcohol War
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous: Pros and Cons
<li> Treatment Centers: The Old and the New
<li> On Psychological Dependence
<li> Is There An Alcoholic Personality?
<li> On Physiological Craving
<li> Alcohol and Drugs: Special Dangers
<li> The Nutritional Approach
<li> Women and Alcohol: Special Problems
<li> Teens and Alcohol: New Trends
<li> Behavior Modification
<li> Techniques for Solitary Self-Help
<li> Self-Help Groups and Inter-Group Dynamics
<li> On Mastering a Drinking Problem
</ul>
Like Charlotte Kasl, the authoress of this book is a woman
who has some special insights into the problem of women
and alcoholism. Hence this book is especially recommended
for women, but its usefulness is not restricted to just
women.

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
My experiences led me to agree with many professional observers that this
classic AA model operates as a cult &#8212; a term I use descriptively,
not judgementally &#8212;
and therein lies the secret of its success. It thrives on exclusivity and
social isolation, on rote repetitions of scriptural doctrine, and on a blind
faith in an omnipotent &quot;leader&quot; and God. It enforces rigid rules of
behavior that virtually program one's every move every day, week, and month.
Members who do best tend to break ties with former friends and family
and relate only to fellow drunks, often attending meetings every day,
sometimes even twice a day. By repetition the Steps and Traditions
become so ingrained that all casual
conversation comes to include key phrases &#8212; &quot;I let go and let God&quot;
is a common saying, for example &#8212; and the idea that one's Higher Power had
a role in virtually every positive moment in one's life is taken for granted
here. The members who told the most inspiring tales, moreover, were generally
the ones whose every moment was coordinated according to the Steps and
Traditions and meeting schedules. Many members speak often of giving up
old haunts and friends to stick &quot;close to home&quot; as one put it,
and the conversation of members tends to revolve so thoroughly around ideas
and activities of recovery that it is probably a relief to old friends when
they drift away. There are alcohol-free social clubs where members meet in
many cities, and many members carry around AA literature and turn to it
whenever they find themselves with nothing to do, for fear that they
will return
to old habits if they relax. &quot;I read the Big Book (the basic text,
written by Bill W.) every day, every time I start to feel nervous,&quot;
one man told me. &quot;It saved me the other day, when I ran into an old
drinking buddy on the subway. He took one look at it and split.&quot;
I had no doubt.<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Since one may never &quot;cross talk&quot; or raise issues not related to one's
addiction, or even talk about the addiction itself in terms other than
the Steps prescribe, one is forced, in the interest of one's progress out
of addiction, to internalize and adopt the &quot;mainstream attitudes&quot;
fostered by the program. &nbsp;...<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The political ramifications of this tendency to subtly impose a totalizing
ideology on members are easy to see. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
As in any kind of hegemonic discourse or ritual, the absence of apparent ideology
is itself the most powerful kind of ideology, since it can never be acknowledged
or questioned. The political implications of this kind of thinking, this kind
of process, are apparent and depressing. &nbsp; ...<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This reactionary tendency of AA is further bolstered by its tendency to exclude
contact with all &quot;outsiders&quot; who may indeed have other ideas about
what has caused a member's suffering and what might be done to assuage it.
One of the characteristics of cults described by
<a href="#Deikman" target="_blank">Arthur Deikman (1990)</a> is a
tendency to &quot;devalue outsiders&quot; and assume &quot;an attitude of
righteousness&quot; about one's own customs and beliefs. In AA and (to a lesser
degree) other recovery groups, this takes the form of labeling as &quot;in denial&quot;
those who question basic tenets.<br>

ACOA is the only group I visited in which no response was ever expected of anyone.
At times, the silence was so nerve-wracking that I felt all eyes upon me, the
ever silent presence, to finally speak. &nbsp; ...<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The members of my home group were a bizarre lot behaviorally, although, by
appearance, they were conventional and respectable. &nbsp; ...<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Other members of this group &#8212; there were about ten women and four men &#8212;
were apparently even more out of control, unable to handle the emotionally
charged, unresolved feelings from childhood, for reasons that were sometimes
explained &#8212; incest and physical torture &#8212; and sometimes hard to figure out
at all.<br>

A great book. Takes up the thread of the web page
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank"><i>Children's Gulags: Child Abuse for Fun and Profit</i></a>
and takes it much further. Includes &quot;boots-on-the-ground&quot;
interviews with principle characters in the
criminal enterprise called &quot;tough love&quot;.
This is absolutely <i>must reading</i> for anyone thinking of sending a
child to a so-called &quot;tough love&quot; boot camp or &quot;character-building&quot; 
 &quot;disciplinary&quot; &quot;wilderness trek&quot;.
Your child might die there. Many already have.
<br>
And the harm done often far outweighs any benefits.  The liabilities of such programs
include children who are scarred for life
and spend many years &#8212; occasionally the rest of their lives &#8212;
trying to overcome <i>post-traumatic stress disorder</i>.
And many children who did not use drugs before being tortured by such
 a program did afterwards.

It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">

It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's explanation of his Twelve Steps and
Twelve Traditions, but it is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness" target="_blank">something quite
dark and evil</a>, Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for
human nature masquerading as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book" target="_blank">all of his own
weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,

Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>

This book is very good. It will probably become another classic.
It really gives you the feeling of being there and going through

It also clearly explains just how the brainwashing worked and how
some men succumbed to it, and how some resisted.
And the book is fascinating and a good read.<br>

LC: BL2525.D55 1990<br>

Fascinating. Recommended. Exposes how cult-like behavior and attitudes
permeate a lot of our institutions, including our churches, corporations,
and government. Dr. Deikman was on a Congressional committee that studied cults after
the Jonestown mass suicide and the murder of Congressman Leo J. Ryan,
and one of the disturbing facts that Deikman noticed was: The question of
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">whether any particular group is a cult</a>
is not a black-or-white, yes-or-no, question. It's all shades of gray,
and many of our organizations, institutions, and government agencies
exhibit cultish behavior to some
extent or other. This book is useful on two levels: First, it describes
cults and cultish behavior in a clear and concise way. And secondly,
it finds that cultish behavior, to varying degrees, in many of our
common institutions.<br>
Deikman saw cults as pushing extreme degrees of these four behaviors:
<ul>
<li> Compliance with the group,
<li> Dependence on a leader,
<li> Devaluing the outsider, and
<li> Avoiding dissent.
</ul>
And then he also found those behaviors contributing to
government disasters like Kennedy's Bay of Pigs and Reagan's Iran-Contra
conspiracy, which has very disturbing implications, because you feel like
it can happen again next week, because the politicians are still doing the
same stupid things, again and again.<br>

ISBN 0-7879-0051-6<br>
LC: BP503.S56<br>
Dewey call number 291.9 S617c<br>
This book is very good. It gives lots of good general background
information on cults, and particularly exposes, in the chapter
&quot;Intruding into the Workplace&quot;,
how some cults have insinuated themselves into the very fabric
of our society, like how Werner Erhard's
<i>est</i> hoax morphed into The Landmark Forum (and similar
organizations) and sold &quot;motivation enhancement seminars&quot;
to corporate America.<br>
<font color="blue">
(I wish she had paid a lot more attention to the children and grandchildren of
Synanon, the abusive &quot;confrontational attack therapy&quot;
drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation programs like <i>The Seed</i> and
<a href="orange-letters13.html#Straight" target="_blank"><i>Straight, Inc.</i></a>, and
<a href="orange-gulags.html" target="_blank">the children's boot camps</a> today,
and how they have insinuated
themselves into the fabric of our society, and pass off their
fascist torture of children as beneficial to America...)
</font>
<p>
I just have one bone to pick with her. She says on page 97 that
Alcoholics Anonymous is not a cult, because
<ul>
<li> A.A. does not
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">recruit
deceptively</a>.
<li> A.A. does not
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html" target="_blank">hide what membership eventually
will entail</a>.
<li> Members can
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_no_exit" target="_blank">leave at any point</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">A.A. focuses on helping
people grow</a>, while cults use their members to
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">promote the growth of the cult</a>
and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">increase the cult
leader's power and wealth</a>.
</ul>
Unfortunately, she got every single one of those points wrong.
A.A. is guilty of every single one of those cult characteristics,
and many more.
<p>
In addition, in her earlier book, <i>&quot;Crazy Therapies&quot;</i>, which
criticized various fad therapies of the nineteen-sixties and -seventies, she
warned of some common characteristics of fraudulent medical treatments:
<ul>
<li>
<font color="blue">
the &quot;Procrustean Bed&quot; &#8212; an all-purpose diagnosis that
can be stretched to fit any problem.
</font>
That's A.A. and its Twelve Steps,
which are
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">the snake-oil that will supposedly cure anything</a>.
<li> <font color="blue">&quot;Unrealistic Expectations&quot;</font>
&#8212; that's A.A. again, which
teaches that a 12-Step panacea &#8212; listing and confessing your sins,
and feeling powerless and guilty about everything &#8212;
will fix alcoholism, keep you from drinking, remove all of your sins,
and give you Sobriety, Recovery, Serenity, Gratitude, and even
&quot;Spirituality&quot;.
<li> <font color="blue">&quot;Unexplained Workings&quot; &#8212; the promoter cannot explain the
theoretical basis of the treatment or its purported successes.</font>
That's A.A. yet again. There is no medical or scientific explanation for
how the 12 steps are supposed to cure or treat alcoholism, or make alcoholics
stop drinking. It's all vague hand-waving and claims that
God will really like you and you will become &quot;spiritual&quot;
<a name="orange-funny_spirituality.html#two_stepper" target="_blank">
if you do Bill Wilson's 12 steps</a>, so then God will do a bunch of
favors for you, like make you quit drinking and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#solve_all" target="_blank">solve all of your problems for you</a>.
</ul>

<i>Take Back Your Life; Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships</i>

Bay Tree Publishing, Berkeley, California, 2006.<br>
LC: BP603.T62 2006,<br>
Dewey: 362.2&#8212;dc22<br>
Another anti-cult book from Janja Lalich.
Good. Unfortunately, Prof. Margaret Thaler Singer has died, but Lalich
is still continuing the good work with a new collaboration.
This book is loaded with valuable information on how to deprogram and free yourself.
Recommmended. Here is a sample:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif"> 
Frequently, at gatherings of former cult members, a lively exchange
takes place when participants compare their respective groups and
leaders. As people begin to describe their special, enlightened,
and unique leader &#8212; whether a pastor, therapist, political leader,
teacher, lover, or swami &#8212; those present are often surprised to learn
that their once-revered leaders are actually quite similar in
temperament and personality. It seems as if those leaders come from
a common mold, sometimes light-heartedly called the
&quot;Cookie-Cutter Messiah School.&quot;<br>

<i>The Making Of A Moonie: Brainwashing Or Choice?</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Eileen Barker<br>
Basil Blackwell Publisher Ltd., Oxford, UK, 1984.<br>

LC: BX9750.S4B37 1984<br>
LCCN: 84-12414<br>
Dewey: 289.9 B225m<br>
Quite good. Rather than just sensationalizing the Moonies, or
grandly proclaiming that cults can brainwash people in a few days,
like some extremist anti-cult people and professional
&quot;deprogrammers&quot; do, the author really delves into
how the recruiting and indoctrination mind games work, and how much the
victim cooperates with the program (or doesn't cooperate).
The author also reveals things like that
the actual recruiters' success rate is about 0.005% (page 147).
The author even gets into psychoanalyzing the members, revealing that
many of them had mental problems before joining the Moonies, and
suggesting that that was why they joined.
This book is a breath of sanity in a field that needs more.

<i>Escape From Utopia: My Ten Years in Synanon</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;
William F. Olin<br>
Unity Press, Santa Clara, CA, 1980.<br>
ISBN 0-913-30053-5<br>
Dewey call number 362.293 O46e<br>
 &#8212; This is the story of Synanon, as it degenerated from a utopian
social organization and also a successful drug and alcohol
rehabilitation program, into a vicious nightmarish cult, ending
with the arrest of the cult's leader Charles &quot;Chuck&quot;
Dederich on charges of conspiracy to commit murder.<br>
This story is especially good because it is told by a man who was
an idealist, a successful architect seeking a utopia, one of the
&quot;life-stylers&quot; who joined Synanon purely out of choice, rather
than one of the addicts desperately fleeing from death by drugs.
It gives his story a certain credibility,
and it also means that it is the story of a life gradually going
down-hill towards Hell over a ten-year period, as the organization
gradually turned into a really bad cult, rather than the story of
someone coming up from the bottom. Where some of the ex-addicts
might have seen even the worst parts of Synanon as improvements
in their lives, Olin didn't. He had a good bit more perspective on
things than that.<br>

&#8212; Very good, complete, chilling, and disgusting. I alternated
between feeling sorry for the members for the abuse they suffered,
and feeling contempt for their massive stupidity
and blindness as they turned around and did it all to somebody else.

<i>Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Bart D. Ehrman<br>
Harper Collins Books, New York, 2005.<br>
ISBN:	0060738170 (cloth)<br>
ISBN:	9780060738174<br>
LCCN:	 2005046326<br>
This is not a book about a cult. It is, rather, a scholarly study
of how the Christian Bible
was written, and rewritten, and changed, over the years, and who did it.
The author is far from a skeptic; he is a professor of theology,
and Chairman of the Department of Religious Studies at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in the heart of the Bible Belt.
He is one of those rare souls who knows the truth about the Bible and
early Christianity, and who will tell the truth &#8212;
and without grinding an ax for some particular sect, or coming off as a fundamentalist.
<br>
The author reveals some stunning facts, like that there are so many
variations and differences in the existing historical fragments of the Bible
that there are actually more possible versions of the Bible than there
are words in the Bible.
<br>
This book is thus very impressive, and important to anyone wanting to
know the truth about a lot of erroneous doctrines. What is especially
appalling is how many Bible-beating fundamentalist churches pick out
a few lines of the Bible and emphasize them and base their entire theology on
their interpretation of those lines,
when in fact the lines are erroneous, or fraudulent inserts or changes, done by some
well-meaning fool who thought that he would &quot;correct errors&quot; and fix things.
<br>
Strongly recommended for anyone who wants a better understanding of the
history of the Bible, or who wants to know what the Bible really says, or did once
say.
