Bill Wilson is telling a story about the financial difficulties that the
early A.A. members endured in order to finally get the <i>Big Book</i> into
print and into alcoholics' hands. His account is less than 100%
accurate or candid. Others suffered, but Bill does not appear to have
suffered too much.
The truth is:
<p>

<b>BIG BOOK MONEY</b><br></font>
$4,450 from stock subscribers<br>
$2,539 from Dr. Silkworth's boss Charlie Towns<br>
$1,000 from W. Cochran<br>
<u>$&nbsp; &nbsp;100 </u> &nbsp; from William Wilson<br>
<b>$8,089 total raised to print the Big Book.</b>
<p>
Eight thousand dollars in 1939 had the same purchasing power as $132,471
in year 2013 dollars &#8212; a solid basis for a book project of 5000 copies.

Now we see that they did not divide <b>the last hundred
dollars</b> among themselves, because:

<p> $2,190 went to Henry Parkhurst<br>
$2,563 went to Ruth Hock<br>
<u>$1,558</u> went to Bill Wilson<br>
<b>$6,311 total expenditures, leaves<br>
 $1,778 remaining cash on hand.</b>
<p>
<font color="blue">Or cash that <i>should be on hand.</i></font>

Actually, the above analysis is too simplistic. The unknown author is definitely
on the right track, and has the right idea, but there are more numbers involved,
all of the rest of the expenses and income. See the next table for details.

<p>
<font color="blue">
And you can bet that Charlie Towns was not &quot;too favorably
impressed&quot; when he heard that the book-publishing venture
in which he had invested so much money was broke, because
<i>someone</i> had frittered away all of the money that had been
collected for printing the book...<br>

That $2,539 that Charlie Towns invested equals approximately $29,985 in year 2000 dollars.
That's serious money. And some bozo spent it all, huh?

It is astonishing to read that Ruth Hock was merely a secretary who
typed letters and manuscripts. Wow, $2,563 was a pretty good salary
for a mere typist at this time!? She earned more than her boss Henry! How
could that be?
<p>
Well, the <a href="orange-june40.html#pg4" target="DocWindow22">balance sheet</a>
is a bit tricky here. Page 173 of &quot;AA Comes of Age&quot; reveals a solution
to the puzzle:
<p>

Neither Henry nor Ruth received a lot of cash.
Bill managed to &quot;satisfy&quot; them with <b>&quot;meaningless stock
certificates&quot; [sic].</b>

In truth, they were not even real stock certificates, because
Works Publishing could not issue any.
A company with that name did not exist before June 1940.
So what Ruth and Henry got were &quot;subscriptions&quot;.<br>

Here is <a href="orange-prospectus.html#sub" target="DocWindow">what
they looked like</a>. See the last page!
<p>
If Henry and Ruth received almost no cash, we have to add, say, $4,000
to the remaining $1,778, making a total of $5,778 available at Bill W.'s
discretion.<br>

<font color="blue">(That's roughly $68,238 in year 2000 dollars.)</font><br>

Where the heck did all of that money go?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Another reason that there were no Works Publishing stock certificates
is that the company &quot;Works Publishing&quot; did not exist at
that time.
The whole story of &quot;Works Publishing&quot; is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="DocWindow23">Big Lie</a>,
a lie told by Bill Wilson so many times that people believe it.
The company that was formed to create the <i>Big Book</i>,
the company that Bill and Hank sold stock in, was the
&quot;<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="DocWindow">ONE
HUNDRED MEN CORPORATION</a>&quot;. If Ruth was given some kind of
I.O.U.s for stock, they were for stock in that corporation.
</font>

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
By the way, what did Ruth Hock finally get for her &quot;stock certificates&quot;?
(They would be worth millions now.)
We know that Bill Wilson conned Henry Parkhurst out of his share of the stock,
giving Henry $200 for some furniture and the stock
certificates<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>,
but what payment did Ruth Hock get for her shares, finally? Was she asked to
just hand over her pay for all of that work, and get nothing in return?

<a name="financial_analysis"> </a>

<font color="blue">
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg4" target="DocWindow24">The June 1940 financial
statement</a> is a real work of fiction. The guys (plus Ruth Hock) who were
trying to resurrect the publishing venture that Bill Wilson had wrecked
were trying hard to cover up the grand theft, the disappearance of all of
the money that Bill Wilson was able to get his hands on, so that the
investors wouldn't realize what a bunch of flakes they had invested
in. And maybe call the police? So there are numerous phony items in
the list of expenditures. The accountant was doing a lot of creative
writing.

<p>
<a name="Hundred_stock_fraud"> </a>
The first very questionable item is actually the company itself.
This financial statement is for &quot;Works Publishing Company.&quot;
But Bill Wilson and Henry Parkhurst had gone around and sold stock
subscriptions for, and collected money for,
a company called &quot;<b>The One Hundred Men Corporation</b>&quot;,
which was supposed to write and publish a book, to be called
<i>&quot;One Hundred Men&quot;</i>,
about a great new &quot;spiritual&quot; way of recovering
from hopeless alcoholism.
See <a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="DocWindow0">the
prospectus</a>.
Bill Wilson made up the name &quot;Works Publishing&quot; when he
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith">illegally, fraudulently,
filed for the copyright</a> of the
<i>Big Book</i> as the sole author.
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocWindow1">
He wrote</a> that the copyright owner was<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;<b>Wm. G. Wilson, trading as Works Publishing Co.</b>&quot;.<br>
</font>
Somehow, some time after that, the name &quot;The One Hundred Men
Corporation&quot; was simply quietly abandoned, and then the early
New York Alcoholics Anonymous group
issued a financial statement that purported to describe
the operations of &quot;Works Publishing Company&quot;.
Such conduct would appear to be felonious stock fraud, selling
shares of stock in a company &#8212;
&quot;<b>The One Hundred Men Corporation</b>&quot; &#8212;
that was never incorporated,
<a href="orange-letters16.html#SEC" target="_blank">never registered with the SEC</a>,
and never even existed.

<p>
The receipts are simple. They are the items listed above, plus the money
that came from selling 2405 books, $6578.98.
So the total income was $14,667.98.  Okay so far,
even though the money from before and after the printing is mixed,
so it is harder to
figure things out. And what is really bad is the mixing of the
for-profit
&quot;Works Publishing&quot; or &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot; and
the non-profit
&quot;Alcoholic Foundation&quot; money and expenses. In truth, they
did not keep them separate at all.
That is a very bad business practice &#8212; illegal, in fact &#8212;
and bad accounting too. Nevertheless, we can
still uncover a lot of the fraudulent numbers.
<p>
The numbers in the table below are the alleged expenditures of
the publishing company, presumably the One Hundred Men Corporation.
The column of numbers for
&quot;Equivalent Year 2000 Dollars&quot;
is just to try to put the numbers in perspective, to make it easier to 
visualize the amounts of money that we are talking about. The
conversion factor is
11.8148.  That is, $100 in 1939 equals $1181.48 in the year 2000.
[<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160807163723/http://www.westegg.com/inflation/" target="newwin45">Inflation
calculator here.</a>]
The comments are self-evident. The column for &quot;Bill Got&quot;
is just a guess
of what Bill <i>might</i> have really gotten out of that particular item.
In truth, to try to be as fair and accurate as possible, we
should bear in mind
that Henry Parkhurst <i>might</i> have gotten some of it.
The numbers are further explained below.

As the anonymous author pointed out, many of the supposed expenditures
were fictitious. Lois Wilson said that Ruth Hock was mostly given
&quot;meaningless stock certificates,&quot; rather than cash, for her
work. She was not paid anything like what the
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg4" target="DocWindow25">Receipts and Disbursements page</a> says.

The report has the secretary Ruth supposedly getting paid more
than the president of the company, Hank, and nearly three times
as much money as Bill.
But Ruth Hock, since she was living at home with her parents,
and &quot;cheerfully accepting meaningless
stock certificates as pay&quot;, probably really got
much less than one quarter of the stated figure in actual spendable cash.
Bill got most of the real money, and she got bogus worthless paper.
And the accountant is covering up Bill's theft with this clumsy deception.
<p>

We can't really tell what Henry ('Hank') Parkhurst got,
so let's give them the
benefit of the doubt, and assume that he drew all of his pay.
<p>

<p>
The rent looks high, but I guess rents are always high in New Jersey or New York,
even though the office was supposed to be just a &quot;little cubical.&quot;
<p>
And the printer was not paid on time, as the anonymous author details below.
Bill got all of that money, the funds that were supposed to cover the
printing cost and the multilith cost.
But the other, more responsible, members of the original New York A.A. group did
get it paid later, to get the printed books. And they hid the extra expense in the other
items.
<p>
The $375 to &quot;critics&quot; is very funny. That's the equivalent of $4,428 today. It paid
for what? Good reviews? Payola to book reviewers? Do they do that?
It is probably something else entirely: paying Tom Uzzell for editing the book.
When the manuscript was completed, it was sent to Dr. Tom Uzzell,
a professor at New York University for final editing.
Dr. Uzzell was a past editor of Colliers Magazine,
contributor to The Saturday Evening Post, and writer of several books.
Other documents say that he was paid $380 for the work, which is close enough.

<p>
And the $731 for advertising looks bogus, and inflated.
They did a
<!-- a href="http://www.AAkills.com/books/revealed.htm" -->
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160807163723/http://www.morerevealed.com/" target="DocWindow26">
free radio interview</a>, and
got a bunch of people to write magazine articles praising A.A. and the book
for their advertising campaign &#8212; all of which cost nothing.
Other A.A. literature explains that they were dead broke at that time,
and had no money for publicity, so they were desperately getting
all of the free publicity they could get, like getting the
friend (<a href="orange-letters8.html#Morgan_Ryan" target="DocWindow27">Morgan Ryan</a>)
of a friend who had a nation-wide radio show
(Gabriel Heatter's <i>&quot;We The People&quot;</i>) to interview them.
And they contacted every magazine editor and writer any of them
knew, to get some free publicity there.
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg5" target="DocWindow28">In page 5 of the report</a>,
they specifically list the authors and the articles that
publicized their cause &#8212; for free.
They claim, in
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg5" target="DocWindow29">the text of the financial report</a>,
that they had a huge one-time expenditure promoting the book,
the equivalent of $8635 in today's dollars.
That seems unlikely, considering that they were &quot;dead broke,&quot;
and had no money for either paying the printer for the books or for promoting the book.
The giant one-time expense was more likely the expense of having Bill Wilson's
hand in the cookie jar.

<p>
There is another story about what happened to the money. The official
A.A. party line is that Bill and the boys used &quot;the last $500&quot;
to send out
a postcard to every doctor east of the Mississippi before the radio
broadcast, urging them to listen in, and that it was all a big waste
of time and money, because only three book orders came in from it. Well,
that sounds like a cover story.
<p>

Bill Wilson wrote in <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, on
page 174, that they sent out 20,000 postcards.
Postcard stamps cost one penny in 1940, so 20,000 of them would cost
$200, which left $300 for buying a mailing list, printing
and paying somebody to address all of the postcards.
<p>
Were there really that many doctors east of the
Mississippi? Where did they get the mailing list? How many
months of their spare time would it have taken the twenty
members of the New York A.A. group to hand address 20,000 postcards?
<p>
Bill Wilson wrote in <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
A list of all physicians in the eastern United States was obtained
from an agency which also designed the post card mailing. This made
us feel sure of at least a few thousand book orders.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So there must be an invoice or a receipt from that agency for
that work sitting somewhere in the sealed Alcoholics Anonymous
archives, and perhaps also a receipt for the postage stamps.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
Can we see those invoices and receipts? No. Why not?<br>
</font>
That sounds suspiciously like a bogus story to explain the
disappearance of $500.<br>
<font color="#5f008f">&quot;We were so hard-working that we sent a
postcard to every doctor east of the Mississippi! That's where
the money went.&quot;</font><br>
Yeh, right.<br>
<font color="green">
(&quot;Is that why you had to work all night, Dear? Gee, and I thought
it was because you were
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="DocWindow31">thirteenth-stepping</a>
that pretty girl from
the meeting. How silly of me...&quot;)
</font>
<p>
But it just gets better and better:
Nan Robertson wrote in her book, <i>Getting Better Inside
Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, that
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Bill Wilson and his friends speculated how they would handle the flood
of inquiries.
At a cost of $500, they had typed and mailed out 20,000 cards to
notify people in the medical profession about the broadcast. They waited
three days, to give enough time for the cards to pile up in the Alcoholic
Foundation's post-office box. Then they took empty suitcases down to the
post office to carry home all the replies.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;When they unlocked the box,&quot; said Lois, &quot;they couldn't
believe their eyes &#8212; only twelve cards. Five hundred bucks had gone down
the drain.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Getting Better Inside Alcoholics Anonymous</i>,
Nan Robertson, 1998, page 75.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh, they <i>typed</i> the cards? That created a real bottle-neck.
They couldn't have had twenty or thirty alcoholics just sitting around
hand-writing the addresses on the postcards day and night until the job
was done. They had to have somebody typing the cards.
How many typewriters did they have?
How many people in A.A., besides Ruth Hock, even knew how to type?
How long would it take one typewriter to type 20,000 post cards?
If poor over-worked Ruth Hock had to type the addresses on
all 20,000 of the cards herself, it would
have taken a <i>long, long</i> time. (Remember that she would have had
a clanky mechanical non-electric typewriter, perhaps a huge, heavy
old Underwood. They are much slower than an electric.)
If they went and rented a few more typewriters, then
they also needed to find and hire some more typists to go with them &#8212; several of them,
because they would have needed typists working around the clock to get all of the
postcards addressed and mailed well before the radio broadcast.
Their tiny &quot;cubicle of an office&quot;, as Bill Wilson called it,
didn't have room for more than 2 or 3 typists, because
they probably only had one desk in there.
<p>
How could they solve all of those problems?
The only reasonable answer, if they really did that mailing, is that they
must have had a printer print up 20,000 postcards with the message on them,
and then they hired some service to address the cards for them. Who?
Where is the receipt?
Why wasn't that large expense listed individually, like the much smaller items
numbered 5, 6, and 10 through 13, rather than just being lumped with other stuff
like the radio broadcast which did not really cost anything?

<p>
<a name="Arx"> </a>
The &quot;W. von Arx&quot; item is <i>very</i> odd. It is large,
($635 in 1939 is $7499 in today's dollars,) and it is completely
unexplained.
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg7" target="DocWindow32">The balance sheet</a> says that
Wallace von Arx was still owed $190 more, for &quot;advances payable&quot;,
but the <a href="orange-june40.html#pg4" target="DocWindow33">Receipts and Disbursements page</a>
doesn't show him as having paid anything in. (<b>??!!</b>)
Apparently, we are supposed to believe that he was a sponsor or supporter
who advanced a total
of $825 in cash, which is $9743.25 in today's dollars, but his
contributions were <b>not
recorded</b> anywhere in the accounting?! Those guys sure had some funny methods of
keeping books.
Anyway, no matter how we look at it, there is something very wrong here,
something wrong to the tune of $9743 in today's dollars.
If Mr. von Arx paid that money in,
then it went somewhere that the books don't show.
Where? Into whose pocket?
Was there really a &quot;Mr. von Arx&quot;?
<font color="#9F0000">[Yes, see the
<a href="orange-letters2.html#Arx" target="DocWindow34">letters</a>.]</font>
Was this large payment to &quot;Mr. von Arx&quot; just one of Bill
Wilson's alter-egos making a withdrawal? Or did Mr. von Arx really
advance $825 in cash, and Bill figured that it was about time that
he got paid again, so he pocketed the money instead of putting it
into the kitty and recording the transaction?
<font color="#9F0000">[Probably the latter.]</font>
<p>
And while we are looking at that <a href="orange-june40.html#pg7" target="DocWindow35">balance
sheet</a>, note that below the name &quot;Wallace von Arx&quot; there
is an <i>F. E. Miller</i> who also advanced $200.
(That's $2362 in Y2K dollars.) But his money is
also not shown as receipts on the <a href="orange-june40.html#pg4" target="DocWindow36">Receipts
and Disbursements page</a> either.
Where did that money go?
This &quot;financial report&quot; has as many holes in it as a piece
of Swiss cheese.

<p>
The furniture expenditure is excessive, and unbelievable. Bill Wilson described the
office as &quot;our little cubicle of an office at 17 William Street, Newark&quot;.
Well, $2834 (in year 2000 dollars) for a used desk, a used table, a few old chairs,
and maybe an old filing cabinet
to go into that &quot;little cubicle&quot; is obviously
grossly inflated, obviously untrue.
Somebody is padding the expense account...
Still, I'll credit this money to Hank, not Bill.
One biographer of Bill Wilson says that
Henry Parkhurst got this money; that 'Hank' had scrounged up some old furniture
from his other business and sold it to Works Publishing. The story is that,
after Hank relapsed, he came around drunk, demanding payment for the furniture
a second time, and Bill Wilson gave him $200 for it in a combination deal that
also required that Hank sign over his 200 shares of &quot;Works Publishing&quot;
(really, the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;) stock.
(So Hank really got $200 for his shares of
stock...)<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>

<p>
The &quot;Wm. Cochran&quot; item is highly deceptive, an outright lie.
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg6" target="DocWindow37">The text of the report</a> explains that William Cochran was
paid back $400 of his original $1000 investment, but
that Mr. Cochran generously donated that refund to
The Alcoholic Foundation. Well, the moneys of The Alcoholic Foundation and
&quot;Works Publishing&quot; (or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;)
were all mixed together here, so the money should never have really
left the company at all. It should have just moved from the left-hand pocket to
the right-hand pocket. Notice that the <i>General Expenses</i> item was simply
split evenly between the two companies.
But that $400 was not applied to The Alcoholic Foundation's
half of the general office expenses, which is what should have been done
with it. So where did the money go?
How about, &quot;Bill Wilson's pocket&quot;?

<p>
And speaking of general office expenses, both The Alcoholic Foundation
and &quot;Works Publishing&quot; (or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;)
managed to rack up the equivalent of $9668 each, (in year 2000 dollars,) in postage
stamps and bubble gum expenditures? Huh? For 15 months of operation?
<p>
Specifically, the report lists &quot;postage, stationery, telephone,
office supplies, car expense, proofreading, book returns, box rentals, printing,
commissions, incorporation expense.&quot; The accountant just split all such expenses
between &quot;Works Publishing&quot; and The Alcoholic Foundation,
which is grossly inappropriate.
Was The Alcoholic Foundation printing and requiring proof-reading?
No, &quot;Works Publishing&quot; (really, the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;)
was printing the book. Were they both
incorporated in the same legal procedure? Not likely.
Did The Alcoholic Foundation pay commissions?
For what? It didn't sell books, or anything else, &quot;Works Publishing&quot; (or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;) did.
It looks like the excessively large &quot;office expenses&quot; of Works Publishing
were being masked by assigning half of them to The Alcoholic Foundation
even though they didn't share a lot of those expenses. But the Alcoholic
Foundation didn't reimburse &quot;Works Publishing&quot; (or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;) for those expenses...
It would have been illegal for the for-profit corporation
<i>&quot;Works Publishing&quot;</i> (really, the
&quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;)
to be paying all of the office expenses
of the non-profit corporation <i>The Alcoholic Foundation</i>.
That is the felony called
&quot;raiding the assets of a corporation&quot; &#8212; cheating the
stockholders of &quot;Works Publishing&quot; or the
&quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;.
<p>

In any case, those numbers look <b>padded.</b>
$19,300 (in year 2000 dollars) in small miscellaneous office
expenses for an impoverished little three-person office that
was supposedly operating on a shoe-string budget for only fifteen months?
Remember that those office expenses <i>did not</i> include the
high-priced items like rent or salaries.

This was just pencils, paper, stamps, the telephone, car expenses, etc.,
and <i>maybe</i> the cost of incorporation. (The corporation named &quot;Works Publishing&quot;
was not incorporated until 1940. The &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot; was never incorporated.)
For a large part of the fifteen months in question, this was mostly
just two or three people sitting in the office, writing,
editing, and typing a book.
And for part of that time, they were totally broke,
and the business was shut down, and spending nothing.
Read the quotes further down this page...
<p>
When we add up the &quot;Bill Got&quot; column, the sum is $8394.62.
That is money that Mr. Wilson <i>might have</i> stuffed into his pockets.
Multiply that by 11.8148 to translate it into year 2000 dollars,
and that is $99,180.76. Not a bad haul for a down-and-out alcoholic.
Maybe that explains how he could drive a Lincoln while he was
&quot;unemployed and dead broke.&quot;

<p>
Now, in truth, I suspect that he got less than that,
probably only half or two-thirds of that, filched here and there,
which is more in line with what the anonymous author figured out by
his own methods of calculation. But that is still a lot of money.
And Henry Parkhurst might have gotten part of the missing money.
Bill Wilson and Henry Parkhurst also had another business,
<i>Honor Dealers</i>, which was a gasoline-buying cooperative,
which was going broke.
Some of the missing moneys might have been sunk into that financial
black hole.
<p>
There is still one more <b>large</b> dangling item here: the text of
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg5" target="DocWindow38">the financial report</a> says
that the new financial managers,
Herbert Taylor, President, and Horace Crystal, Vice-President,
who took over after Bill bankrupted the
business, had to sell more stock and also borrow $1000 to cover expenses,
just to stay in business until they could sell a bunch of books.
<font color="#9F0000">
(That's how there could be $828 left in the bank account after Bill said
that all of the money was spent.)
</font>
<b>But that money does not appear <i>anywhere</i> in the
<a href="orange-june40.html#pg4" target="DocWindow39">Receipts and Disbursements page</a>.</b>
So that new money was covering invisible expenses, which were not
listed above,
like Bill Wilson's hand... Or, if the new money really did
go to pay for a bunch of the expenses listed above, like the
printer's invoices &#8212; so that they could get the books from
the printer &#8212; then it was only because <i>somebody</i> had already
taken an equal amount of the old money that was supposed to
pay for those same expenses...
<p>
Obviously, that whole financial report is false, and a big cover-up.

I reminded Jerseyites at the Convention of early meetings in Upper
Montclair and South Orange and in Monsey, New York, when Lois
and I moved over there about the time the A.A. book came off the
press in the spring of 1939, after the foreclosure of the Brooklyn
home of her parents where we had been living. The weather was warm,
and we lived in a summer camp on a quiet lake in western New
Jersey, the gracious loan of a good A.A. friend and his mother.
Another friend let us use his car. I recalled how the summer had been
spent trying to repair the bankrupt affairs of the A.A. book, which
money-wise had failed so dismally after its publication.
<font color="#9F0000">We had a hard time keeping the
sheriff out</font>
of our little cubicle of an office at 17
William Street, Newark, where most of the volume had been written.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

of 1939, at the Upper Montclair house of
<font color="#9F0000">
Henry P., my partner in the now shaky book enterprise</font>.
There we met Bob and Mag V., our

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then, on May first [1939], fresh calamity fell upon 182 Clinton Street. Lois
and I had been living in a house which belonged to her parents
before their death. The bank had taken it over and rented it to us for a
<b>nominal sum.</b> The mortgage was so big the bank had found great
difficulty in selling the place, so we had been able to stay there several
years. But at this moment they found a purchaser and we had to get
out. From its four floors the old brick house disgorged its furniture
into a moving van. The warehouse had to pay the mover, since we
could not. All our worldly goods were in hock with the warehouse-man,
and they were to stay that way for two years more. Where could
we go?<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Friends rallied around. A small fund, just about the first money
our Foundation ever had, was set up as the &quot;Lois W. Home Replacement
Fund.&quot; To this, surrounding A.A. families began to make tiny
contributions. Small, of course, because everybody was broke. Out of
this, the Trustees began to pay Lois and me $50 a month. A newer
member, Jack C. loaned us a battered Lincoln automobile. But where
would we live? The question was settled by Howard and his mother,
who owned a summer camp on a remote lake in western New Jersey.
Here we stayed until snow flew in November. This interval gave us
the needed opportunity to revive the bankrupt book project.
</td>
<td valign="top" width="50%">
<font size="4" base="4">
We learn that bankers were more effective than police officers in Bill's
case. They took over the house and sold it, throwing Wilson out.
However, he continued to live at other people's expense. Despite being
broke, he managed to drive a Lincoln automobile and could draw
$50 a month. This convenient sum (comparable to $1500 in 1999) was sneaked
out of &quot;tiny contributions&quot; from people,
who were themselves &quot;broke&quot;.

<p><br>
<font color="blue">
The inflation calculator says that $50 in 1939 is equal to $591 in
the year 2000. Nevertheless, it was a livable wage for 1939,
low, but liveable, especially when you aren't paying rent or utilities.

Bill and Lois moved in with Henry Parkhurst on April 26, 1939, when
the bank foreclosed on the 182 Clinton Street house.

As noted earlier, Lois and I moved to the home of Bob and Mag in
Monsey, New York, to spend the winter of 1939 and the early spring
of 1940. A little after this we moved to a friend's apartment in New
York City, then briefly to a room in Greenwich Village, and finally
to A.A.'s first clubhouse, &quot;The Old Twenty-Fourth,&quot; where we
remained until the spring of 1941.

One sad incident marred the early spring of 1940. Not knowing
where any of us might live in the future, we had chosen Box 658 at
one of New York's downtown post offices as the most central point of
the whole metropolitan area, Long Island and New Jersey included.
It now seemed right for us to establish a small office near this box.

Henry, whose job took him into western New Jersey, objected violently.<br>

His job was not going too well, and he was on what we nowadays
call a &quot;dry bender.&quot; The more we insisted the more adamant and
violent he became. He was heavily beset with other problems, too. At
length he broke down completely and went on a terrific bender after
four years of sobriety. He never again showed any real sign of recovery,
and he went on drinking until his death recently. Considering
what he had done for the book, and the further fact that he was one
of our first New York members, this was hard to take.

Those $50 a month withdrawals continued until spring, 1940.
Wilson did practically nothing but sneak money out of others

Bill puts the conflict between him and Henry merely on the
level of jealousy. In spite of being married to Lois, Bill
tried to hit on Ruth, even though she was in love with Hank,
and was considering marriage with him.

But there was more. Hank also had other objections: Hank worked

Bill said, it was for Lois.

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One indication of their financial irresponsibility can be found in
how fast and loose they played with Works Publishing's stock.
Lois Wilson flatly states that Honor Dealer's secretary, Ruth Hock, &quot;was
paid, when paid at all, with book stock.&quot;
And Bill and Hank simply issued certificates to pay her (thus
devaluing those owned by the Works Publishing investors).
<p>
Even if all of this was done in a technically legal manner (which seems
highly unlikely), it would have been fair neither to the investors
who had put $5000 into Works Publishing to finance publication of the &quot;Big Book,&quot;
nor to Charles Towns or Agnes who had loaned them money for living
expenses.
As well, since Bill and Hank apparently never bothered to incorporate Works
Publishing, they could well have been guilty of unauthorized sale of
securities (the stock), a criminal offense.
And by selling stock in a company with no assets, they quite possibly violated
the Blue Sky laws, designed to protect investors from fraud.
<p>
One indication that Bill and Hank might have known that they were engaging in
illegal activity can be found in the afterword of sorts, titled &quot;The
Alcoholic Foundation,&quot; in the back of the 400 multilithed copies of the &quot;Big
Book&quot; produced in January 1939. In it, they mention neither the loans
nor the $5000 raised from sale of stock when they touch on the finances of the
&quot;Big Book's&quot; publication.
Instead of acknowledging the loans and stock sale, they state:
&quot;This volume is published by the Works Publishing Company, organized
and financed mostly by small donations of our members.&quot;
Unless they knew (or at least suspected) that their financial dealings
were illegal, it's difficult to see why Bill Wilson and Hank P. would
have written and published this lie about the finances of Works Publishing.<br>

claiming sole authorship of the book</a>,

thus breaking his promise to all of the co-authors that
the book would belong to the group.
And then

Note that Bill Wilson was not supposed to be getting any royalties,
and neither was Dr. Bob. The original deal was that
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#budget" target="DocWindow">Bill
was to be paid $1000 cash</a>
to write the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>, just
as contract labor, with no royalties to accrue.
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="DocWindow">See the prospectus</a>.
(Bill actually got $1558 for the work, and then he seems to have stolen a
lot of other money to go with it.) All profits from sales of the
book were supposed to go to the stockholders of the One Hundred Men
Corporation. But since Bill and Henry Parkhurst
each owned 1/3 of the stock in the One Hundred Men Corporation,
they were still in a position to benefit handsomely if the book sold
a large number of copies. Still, no royalties were supposed to be paid
to any of the 32 authors. The royalties were supposed to go to
The Alcoholic Foundation. That was
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="DocWindow">the original deal</a>.
But Bill changed the deal after he had stolen the copyright
and could blackmail the fellowship into giving him more money.

Only Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith got any royalties for the <i>Big Book</i>.
No other author, not Henry Parkhurst or anyone else, got anything at all.
Henry Parkhurst wrote two chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>, &quot;To Employers&quot;
and &quot;The Unbeliever&quot;, plus the detailed outline for the whole
book, while Dr. Bob wrote just one chapter, his own short autobiography,
but Henry still got no royalties, not a penny.  But he did own 200 shares of
&quot;Works Publishing&quot; (or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;),
which was one-third of the whole company, shares which
would eventually be worth many millions of dollars,
when the book sold in large numbers for many years...

One biography of Bill Wilson suggested that Henry Parkhurst was responsible
for all of the &quot;Works Publishing&quot; (or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;)
money disappearing.
If that is so, how is it that Bill Wilson ended up getting all of the money?
There was no doubt in Henrietta Seiberling's mind:
<a href="orange-Henrietta_Seiberling.html" target="_blank">Henrietta
Seiberling wrote that Bill Wilson took the money</a>.

Doctor Bob's daughter Sue Smith said the same thing too &#8212; that
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Parkhurst_cheated" target="DocWindow51">Bill took the money</a>,
and all of the
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#Sue_Smith" target="DocWindow52">credit for writing the book</a>,
for himself</a>.
<p>
And, on top of that, Henry Parkhurst ended up getting only $200 for
his shares of &quot;Works Publishing&quot;
(or the &quot;100 Men Corporation&quot;),
because Bill Wilson conned him out of those shares when Henry
was drunk and begging for money.

<p>
How could Bill Wilson do that to his friend?
What happened to &quot;unconditional love&quot;?
Or any kind of love?
How could Bill Wilson take <i>everything</i> away from his old
friend &quot;Hank&quot;, strip him down to nothing, and leave him
to die drunk and broke?  &#8212; Which is what happened to Hank.
<p>
<font color="#bf0000">
(Then, to add insult to injury,
Bill Wilson collected royalties on Henry Parkhurst's work, like the
<i>To Employers</i> chapter, for the rest of his (Bill's) life.)

Hank's resentment was compounded by what he took to be Bill's enrichment
at his own expense. Early in 1940, when the Alcoholic Foundation was
buying up all shares in Works Publishing Company, Hank refused at first to
cooperate. But when he showed up &quot;completely broke and very shaky&quot;
at the New York office one day, Bill took advantage of Hank's condition and
cajoled him into signing the necessary papers. In return Hank received $200,
ostensibly in payment for office furniture.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This turned out to be a mistake of huge financial proportions &#8212; on the same order
of folly as Esau's selling his birthright to his brother Jacob for a mess of pottage &#8212;
for &quot;it was not long after this incident that Bill was granted a royalty on
the book, similar to the one that had already been voted for Dr. Bob. While
this royalty was at first very modest, it eventually became substantial and provided
both Bill and Lois a lifetime income.&quot; Understandably, Hank always felt he
had been cheated out of &quot;any future share in the book's profits&quot; (PIO, 236).<br>

Mind you, Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Parkhurst was an old friend.
He was the first alcoholic that Bill Wilson
recruited in New York City, so he was New York's A.A. Number Two,
or Number One, depending on whether you count Bill Wilson.
His original date of sobriety was either October or November 1935, so
he had been dry in A.A. for four years.
Bill and Hank were such close friends that Bill and Lois had moved in with
Hank Parkhurst on April 26, 1939, after the bank foreclosed on the
182 Clinton Street house that Lois Wilson's parents used to own.
Hank was the friend they turned to when they were homeless.

<p>
Did Bill Wilson try to help his old friend Hank when Hank was in
trouble? Did Bill try to sober him up, and get him back on track,
like they show A.A. members doing for each other in the movies?
No, Bill Wilson just took all of Hank's <i>Hundred Men Corporation</i> (or
<i>Works Publishing</i> or whatever they called it) publishing company stock
away from him for a pittance, and left Hank to die drunk and penniless.
Which Henry Parkhurst did.
And then Bill complained about how much it bothered him
that Hank had relapsed and was gone &#8212; that &quot;it was hard to
take&quot;.
<p>
<font color="blue">
How about how hard it was for Hank to take?<br>

that way back in the early days, while Parkhurst and Wilson were writing the

On another web site, we find a page about Henry Parkhurst and the
birth of the <i>Big Book</i>. The story there white-washes Bill's behavior
in this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font color="#5f008f">
But Hank became very hostile toward Bill.  Problems developed between them
over the way Hank was setting up Works Publishing Co., as a for profit
corporation, with himself as President.  As a result of the feedback from
group members, Bill listed himself as the sole author of the Big Book as a
means of counter-balancing this.
<p>
There were other problems over money, and over Ruth Hock.  Hank wanted to
divorce his wife, Kathleen, and marry Ruth, and when Ruth decided to go with
Bill when he moved the A.A. office out of Honor Dealers, Hank was furious.
Bill paid him $200 for the office furniture (which he claimed he still owned,
but which had been purchased from him earlier), in exchange for Hank turning
over his stock in Works Publishing, as all the others had done.  Hank then
went to Cleveland to try to start problems for Bill there.<br>

What a cover-up. Somebody is really spouting the standard party line.
These are the facts:
<ol>
<li> It was Bill Wilson who wanted the book-publishing company to
be a for-profit company. He had talked constantly
about how their unnamed &quot;group of anonymous alcoholics&quot;
had to make some money somehow, by having paid alcoholism-recovery
missionaries <i>or something</i>, because Bill was broke.
It was Bill who had sold the other
alcoholics on the idea of making money off of a book, and then using
that money, he said, to finance an Alcoholic Foundation.
The other alcoholics were very cool to the idea at first, but Bill
eventually convinced them.
The other A.A. members elected Hank as President of the corporation,
a fact which obviously really irritated Bill.
<p>
Bill Wilson himself wrote about his promotional schemes:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Dr. Bob very much liked the idea of a book. But when it came to paid
missionaries and profit-making hospitals he was frankly dubious.
Promoter that I was, I shared few of his fears. I felt that we
would have to have money and maybe a lot of it.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William
G. Wilson, page 145.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li> Undoubtedly, there was friction between Henry Parkhurst and
Bill Wilson. Both seem to have had dominant alpha-male personalities.
But to say that Hank was guilty of autocratic empire-building
sounds too much like psychological projection. It was Bill Wilson
who ended up
being the <i>Czar and High Priest</i> of Alcoholics Anonymous.
And it was Bill Wilson who ended up being a dangerous psychopath
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_to_heretics" target="DocWindow58">who sentenced people
to an alcoholic death</a> for daring to disagree
with his religious proclamations.
<p>
<li> To say that Bill listed himself as the sole author of the
<i>Big Book</i> to protect
the book from Henry Parkhurst is a laugh. That's like saying that
Bill Wilson had to steal all of the money to keep Henry Parkhurst from
stealing it. What evidence is there that Bill was urged to take
sole ownership of the copyright by &quot;group members&quot;?
Show me the documentation. And if Bill was being so honest, why did he use a phony
company name on the copyright form?

The real evidence is that Bill promised everyone that the book would
be owned by the whole group &#8212; Bill had to promise that to everybody,
repeatedly,
to get them to agree to do the book and to write their stories &#8212;
and then Bill broke that promise.
Doctor Bob's daughter, Sue Smith Windows, says that some of the members
were very upset by Bill's betrayal, and one of them, the author of
&quot;ACE FULL...SEVEN ELEVEN&quot;, demanded that
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#ACE_cheated" target="DocWindow59">his story be removed</a>
from the book when he learned of Bill's chicanery.

<p>
<li> If Bill had to steal all of the money to keep Hank from getting it,
why didn't Bill give it all back after Hank left A.A.?
Follow the money. Who profits?
Hank died broke; Bill died rich. Bill gave all of the royalties money to
himself and Dr. Bob, and then, after the death of Dr. Bob, just to
himself. Bill didn't really have to keep all
of the money for himself just to keep Hank from getting it, did he?
Especially not after Hank had died.
<p>
<font color="#bf0000">
And remember that Bill Wilson wasn't even supposed to be getting paid any
royalties at all. The deal was that
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#budget" target="DocWindow">
he was contract labor, to be paid a flat rate of $1000</a>, for
writing the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>.
Bill wasn't supposed to get a lifetime income out of it, but that's
what he ended up taking for himself.

<p>
<li> It says that &quot;Hank then went to Cleveland to try to start

<li> Several of the early A.A. members, including Clarence Snyder, complained
about Bill Wilson's financial dishonesty. Bill's henchmen in New York rationalized
and covered up his behavior.
In a letter to Clarence Snyder from The Alcoholic Foundation, July 7, 1944, the
Alcoholic Foundation trustees argued:
<p>
<a name="DrBob_royalties"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The original agreement stipulated that the 35 cent royalty
which would have been paid by a commercial publisher to
Wilson be granted [to] The Alcoholic Foundation.
This however was changed by Wilson and Parkhurst who in 1940
donated their contingent two thirds interest in Works Publishing
to The Alcoholic Foundation.
As Mr. Parkhurst had entirely withdrawn as manager of the book enterprise
both he and Mr. Wilson thought The Foundation should control the book.
Feeling grateful for the part Dr. Smith had taken they stipulated
that the royalty payable to The Foundation be turned over to Dr. Smith
and his wife Anne, for their lifetime.<br>

<font size="-1"><a href="orange-cleve1944.html#page2" target="DocWindow64"><i>A letter to Clarence Snyder

</blockquote>
<p>
That is just plain old wrong. Bill Wilson was never entitled to any 35 cent royalty.
He was not the sole author of the book, or even the principal author.
He did not write the book, or even half of the book.
That same letter says that more than 50 A.A. members worked on it.
Bill Wilson was just hired contract labor, entitled to no royalties.
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#royalty" target="DocWindow65">The original agreement</a>
said that the authors' royalties would go to the Alcoholic Foundation, and that the
publishing company's profits would of course go to the stockholders.
Bill couldn't just arbitrarily change that agreement after the fact &#8212;
not legally &#8212; especially not after a lot of company stock had been sold under
the original agreement.
<p>
And it didn't matter how &quot;grateful&quot; Mr. Parkhurst and Mr. Wilson felt towards
Dr. Smith &#8212; they did not have the legal right to give the stockholder's money to
Dr. Smith for life.
Wilson and Parkhurst didn't own any royalties that they could give to Doctor Bob.
<p>
Furthermore, Henry Parkhurst didn't agree
to any of that. He was gone, relapsed, busy dying drunk. Bill Wilson was
just putting words into Hank's mouth. (Bill Wilson was once again using the
propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hide" target="DocWindow66"><i>Hiding Behind Others</i></a>.)
<p>
The money to Dr. Bob looks suspiciously like a big pay-off for complicity in Bill's crimes.
Dr. Bob told the Akron members not to make a fuss about Bill's financial dishonesty &#8212;
&quot;for the good of the Fellowship&quot; &#8212;
and then Bill Wilson gave Dr. Bob an income for life. None of the other book co-authors
got a penny.
<p>
Doctor Bob's daughter, Sue Smith Windows, wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Rather than argue with, and possibly embarrass Bill Wilson, my father chose not to
expose Bill for his devious ways for the good of the Fellowship.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the authors of a personal story that appeared in the original manuscript (ACE
FULL...SEVEN ELEVEN) from Akron asked that his story be removed from the book prior
to publication after finding out about Bill's personal financial aspirations from the sale of the
book. It was revealed that Bill and Ruth Hock already publicly distributed the multilith
manuscript and sold it for $3.50. A part of the approximately 400 copies were not sold.
Neither my father's copy nor any of the other copies I have ever seen or heard of had been
stamped &quot;Loan Copy,&quot; or bore any such similar statement. The relating report in AA Comes
of Age (page 165) is fraudulent and dead wrong.
Many of the Ohio members were also upset but were told by my father that
for the good of the Fellowship not to further hinder publication of the book.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
So after Doctor Bob told the other members not to make a fuss about
Bill Wilson's financial dishonesty, Bill cut Doctor Bob in on the stolen money.
<p>
Notice that Sue Smith Windows just declared that Bill Wilson published a multilith (like mimeograph)
edition of the <i>Big Book</i> that contained neither a copyright notice nor any statement that
it was just a pre-publication &quot;loaner copy&quot;. That invalidated the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i>
right there.
The copyright was forever lost, invalidated, forfeit, and gone. The <i>Big Book</i> went into
the public domain right then and there.


<p>
<li> If the fight between Henry Parkhurst and Bill Wilson had occurred in
a vacuum, with no surrounding circumstances, it might be possible
to believe that Bill was honest and noble and Hank was dishonest
and underhanded. However, this story did not occur in a vacuum.
<ul>
<li> We have all of the rest of the history of A.A., and the literature
of A.A., to go with it.
<li> And we have all of the surrounding documentation that refutes Bill's
claims, and refutes the A.A. members' apologies for Bill.
<li> We have the statements of Doctor Bob's daughter, Sue Smith Windows.
<li> We have the statements of Henrietta Seiberling and Clarence Snyder.
<li> We have the illegal sale of stock in, and the strange disappearance of,
the <b>One Hundred Men Corporation</b>.
<li> We have the disappearance of the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund.
<li> We have Bill Wilson taking the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i> for
himself, illegally and fraudulently claiming that he was the sole author on
the copyright application form.
<li> We have Bill Wilson paying himself three times for the same work &#8212; writing
the opening chapters of the <i>Big Book</i>:
<ol>
<li> First, Bill was paid $1558 when he was supposed to get $1000 for
writing those chapters.
<li> Next, Bill helped himself to the <i>Big Book</i> publishing fund.
<li> And then Bill used the stolen copyright to force the Alcoholic
Foundation to pay him royalties for life.
</ol>
<li> We have plenty of evidence of Bill's brain-damaged
delusions of grandeur, his arrogant, domineering and manipulative
personality, his callous treatment of other people, including his wife Lois,
his religious bigotry, his love of Buchmanism and the fascist Oxford Groups,
his habitual lying and deceit, his hypocritical philandering,
and his eventual self-promotion to the status of High Priest of a
religious cult.
</ul>

There is very little reason for us to believe that Bill Wilson told the
truth about any of the <i>Big Book</i> project.

Works Publishing Stock Certificate.
</center>
<p>
Note that the people who signed it were
Ruth Hock, Secretary/Treasurer, and Herbert Taylor, President.
That was the new staff who assumed control of the publishing business after
Bill Wilson ran the business into the ground.
<p>
This stock certificate was issued on the 20th of July, 1940, which was
after Henry Parkhurst had gone, and after Bill Wilson
had been removed from management of the business venture because
of the disappearance of the publishing fund.
And it was also after Bill Wilson had stolen the copyright of the <i>Big Book</i>
and registered it in the name of &quot;Works Publishing&quot;, which prompted the
more honest A.A. members to incorporate a new company called &quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot;.

</td></tr></table>

A final take on the stock issue: When the publishing venture proved
profitable, Bill and &quot;the trustees&quot; asked that the
stockholders sell their shares back to Works Publishing for whatever
people had paid for them; that is, at no profit. The rationale
behind this was that the Alcoholic Foundation wanted to keep all of
the stock of the publishing venture &quot;in the family.&quot;
Meaning: those people who had supported this venture from the very
beginning, and trusted this bunch of newly-sober losers, and had
given them <i>that last full measure of devotion</i> &#8212; all of
the money in their wallets &#8212; well, those people were not really
&quot;family&quot; any more.
They didn't rate being allowed to own stock in the publishing
company any more, now that the company was actually profitable.
<p>
They sure rated in the beginning, when the venture was desperate for cash.
They sure rated in the beginning when it was an extremely risky venture,
likely to go broke.
They sure rated after Bill took and spent all of the money, and the
company had to sell more stock to stay in business.
But when the book started to sell, and the venture proved profitable, and
there was money to be shared, those courageous, generous, early
supporters were no longer quite &quot;part of the family&quot;, and they
were no longer welcome at the table.
<p>
Nice, huh?
<p>
In the beginning, to get people to buy the stock,
<a href="orange-prospectus.html#big_returns" target="DocWindow">the
prospectus</a> had bandied about large numbers for the returns that
the investors would enjoy for each $25 share purchased:

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By June first the subscription would have been returned. Then,
if the following sales are reached the profit per share would be:<br>

<p>
So the potential investors were even teased with the possibility of
making $900 from a $25 investment.
But when push came to shove, the investors were cheated.
They got no share of the profits, none at all.
<p>
That is also a kind of stock fraud.
How it works is, you sell a bunch of stock shares or stock
subscriptions to people,
and go into business with the money.
If the venture proves profitable, you refuse to share the profits with
the stockholders &#8212; you cancel the stock issue, and just buy their
shares back for whatever they paid for them.
On the other hand, if the business venture fails, and goes broke,
well then, of course,
you never even think about buying back the stock and giving people
their money back. You let them take the loss.
<p>
It's a &quot;Heads I win, Tails you lose&quot; kind of deal.
You make someone else take all of the risk of loss, but they have no
chance of sharing in the profits if the venture is a winner.
<p>
That kind of stock fraud is also against the law.
Again, William G. Wilson was supposedly a
&quot;<a href="orange-religiousroots.html#stock_broker" target="DocWindow68">stock broker</a>&quot; and a
&quot;securities analyst&quot;.
He must have known all about that stuff. It was his job to know.
That's why the SEC licenses stock brokers &#8212; so that
brokers have to know what they are doing.
<p>
So Bill had to know that such behavior was felony stock fraud, but
he did it anyway, and got away with it.
<p>
And note that Bill Wilson was
again <a href="orange-Randy-ltr.html#hiding_behind" target="DocWindow69">hiding behind
other people</a>, masking his true intentions by using The Alcoholic
Foundation as a screen.
His declarations that The Alcoholic Foundation should own all of the
stock of &quot;Works Publishing&quot; sounds innocent enough on the surface,
even unselfish and generous, since Bill was even donating
&quot;his own stock&quot; (his allotment of stock in the now-defunct
and nonexistent <i>&quot;One Hundred Men Corporation&quot;</i>, remember?),
but it was just another scheme for Bill Wilson to get his hand into the
cookie jar yet again (since he was now barred from ever running
Works Publishing Inc.):
<ul>
<li> All of the Works Publishing stock went to The Alcoholic Foundation,
so The Alcoholic Foundation got all of the profits from the book sales,
<li> and
<a href="orange-cleve1944.html#wilson_income" target="DocWindow71">then most of the
book profits went</a> from The Alcoholic Foundation
to Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith; ultimately, mostly to Bill Wilson.
<i>&quot;Supporting Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Smith&quot;</i>
was the biggest
&quot;office expense&quot; of The Alcoholic Foundation.
By 1944, Bill was getting $320 per month, which is $3789 per
month in Y2K dollars. Not bad for going to a few meetings and
promoting A.A. with a few speeches. And the numbers kept going up.
Now they are millions per year.
<li> Bill Wilson could blackmail The Alcoholic Foundation into giving
him the money, because he had filed for the copyright of the
<i>Big Book</i>
<a href="orange-BB-cpyrite.gif" target="DocWindow15">in his own
name</a>, so he owned the copyright, and The Alcoholic Foundation
just had to have that copyright to be able to continue publishing the book.
And Sue Smith Windows says that her father, Doctor Bob, told the other
members not to make a big fuss about Bill's dishonesty because
it would hurt the fellowship. That was very understanding of Dr. Bob.
Was it just a coincidence that Bill then cut Dr. Bob in on the
stolen royalties? (And <i>only</i> Dr. Bob?)
</ul>
<p>
The people who gave up their Works Publishing stock didn't know
what the real arrangement would end up being &#8212; they were just asked
to forego their profits in order to
&quot;help The Alcoholic Foundation.&quot;
<p>
<a name="Rockefeller_01"> </a>
The official A.A. history book <i>PASS IT ON</i> tells this story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now that the book was beginning to sell, some of the subscribers began
to demand a share of the profits. There were 49 subscribers. Bill and Hank
each held a third of the stock, and Ruth had also received shares, in
lieu of pay. Early in 1940, Bill and the trustees decided that the book
should belong to A.A., not to the individuals who had subscribed for shares.
By issuing some preferred shares, and obtaining a loan from the Rockefellers,
they were able to call in all outstanding shares at par value of $25 per share.
Most of the stockholders were delighted to come out even; some even donated
all or part of the money to the Alcoholic Foundation.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But Hank resisted all their pleas to turn over his one-third ownership
(200 shares) in Works Publishing to the foundation. &quot;One day, completely
broke and very shakey, he turned up at the Vesey Street office,&quot; said
Bill. &quot;He pointed out that most of our office furniture still belonged
to him, particularly the huge desk and overstuffed chair.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That gave Bill an idea. He proposed that the foundation buy the furniture for
$200 if Hank would then turn in his Works Publishing stock. After some prodding,
Hank finally consented, and signed the necessary papers.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But he resented Bill's persuading him to turn over his shares. To make matters
worse, it was not long after this incident that Bill was granted a royalty on
the book, similar to one that had already been voted for Dr. Bob.
While this royalty was at first very modest, it eventually became substantial
and provided both Bill and Lois a lifetime income.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hank's son said that Hank always felt that he had been treated badly. He thought
Bill made a deal with the foundation that excluded Hank from any future share in
the book's profits. What clouds the entire issue is the fact that Hank's drinking
had put a wall between Hank and many of the members who eventually
supported royalty payments for Bill.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>'PASS IT ON', The story of Bill Wilson and how the
A.A. message reached the world</i>, Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. staff,
1984, pages 235-236.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So Hank didn't get paid for his work because he went out and got drunk?
That wasn't in the contract.
<p>
Note that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Early in 1940, Bill and the trustees decided that the book
should belong to A.A., not to the individuals who had subscribed
for shares.&quot;</font><br>
Bill and &quot;the trustees&quot; had no right to make any such decision. They didn't
own the book; the stockholders did.

The book and the publishing company already belonged to the stockholders,
including Henry Parkhurst. The Alcoholic Foundation had already promised the
profits to the stock subscribers, to get them to buy the stock in the first place.
Changing the deal later and giving the profits to someone else, like
Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob, was fraud &#8212;
cheating the stockholders out of the money that was owed to them.

<p>
It is easy to understand how Henry Parkhurst felt that it looked bad
that shortly after he was cheated out of any and all dividends and royalties
from the book, Bill Wilson was given an income for life.

<p>
It's easy to see how Henrietta Seiberling could write that
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Henrietta" target="DocWindow14">she was fed up
with Bill Wilson and his schemes</a>.

<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
By the way, what did Ruth Hock finally get for her &quot;stock certificates&quot;?
(They would be worth millions now.)
We know that Bill Wilson conned Henry Parkhurst out of his share of the stock,
giving Henry $200 for some furniture and the stock
certificates<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>,
but what payment did Ruth Hock get for her shares, finally? Was she asked to
just hand over her pay for all of that work, &quot;for the good of the fellowship&quot;,
and get nothing in return? Apparently so. There is no record of her ever getting paid real money.

</font>

<p>
So in the end, Bill Wilson got all of the book royalties, all of the money, all of the fame and glory,
all of the women, and a big house in the country and a Cadillac car to drive around in.
The other A.A. members got nothing.

<b>&quot;Putting Something Over&quot;</b>

<p>
Pulling the wool over someone's eyes and putting something over on
someone describe the behaviors of conniving, manipulative, destructive
narcissists. These people are dedicated to taking advantage of others
in any way possible in their search for reassurance of their
superiority. They revel in their successes and can become very angry
and hurt if you suggest that there is anything wrong in the tactics
they use to achieve their goals. They, of course, can do no wrong,
and if they use what you are terming as unfair tactics, it is only
because that is what everyone else is doing, and therefore they
are justified in using these tactics.<br>

A final note: Now, perhaps, we know a few of the real reasons why
the trustees of AAWS (Alcoholics
Anonymous World Services, Inc.) and the GSO (General Services
Organization) keep so many of the historical
documents and records of A.A.
locked up and hidden, and unavailable to any historian, scholar,
curious member, or bothersome critic...
The real history of A.A. is pretty sordid... And the real story
of Bill Wilson is simply outrageous.
<p>

It is no wonder that the Hazelden &quot;autobiography&quot;
of Bill Wilson says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There will be future historical revelations about Bill's character
and behavior in recovery that will be interpreted, by some,
as direct attacks on the very foundation of AA.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Bill W., My First 40 Years</i>,
&quot;William G. Wilson&quot; (posthumously ghost-written by
Hazelden staff),
Hazelden, 2000, page 170.</font></blockquote>
<p>
But we still haven't seen those revelations, after all these years.
What could they still be hiding in those sealed archives,
that we haven't already figured out?
<p>

Now, finally, is this really the kind of organization that we want
judges, parole officers, &quot;therapists&quot; and &quot;counselors&quot;
to force people to join?

This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is
very positively slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author
knew Mr. Wilson and worked beside him for the last 12 years
of Mr. Wilson's life. And rumor has it that this book was prepared
from autobiographical tapes that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's
warts, his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his
years-long &quot;dry drunks&quot;...

Francis Hartigan was the secretary of and confidant to Bill
Wilson's wife Lois. This book is pretty much a white-wash and
tells the whole story from Bill's point of view. But it does
contain a few surprises, like the chapter &quot;The Other Woman&quot;
which details Bill's love affair with Helen Wynn, and hints at
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="DocWindow73">
all of his other affairs</a> where he cheated on Lois, both before
and after sobriety, all of his married life.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Note the interesting fact that Lois Wilson had her own private secretary.
That doesn't quite jibe with the published image of Bill and Lois
as a couple of desperately poor people who were always struggling
just to survive. The A.A. propagandists fail to tell you that Bill
Wilson managed to arrange A.A. finances so that he and Lois lived like
royalty in their A.A.-supplied house, while driving an A.A.-supplied
Cadillac car and being supported in comfort for the
rest of their lives by the Alcoholics Anonymous organization,
with private secretaries and mistresses, even. So much for
the much-ballyhooed &quot;unselfish, constructive action&quot;,
&quot;abandoning self-seeking&quot;, and &quot;no thought of the profit
motive&quot; that Wilson always promoted (for others).

<i>Narcissism, Denial of the True Self</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alexander Lowen, M.D.<br>
Macmillan Publishing Comany, New York, 1983, and<br>
Collier Macmillan Publishers, London, 1983.<br>
ISBN: 0-02-575890-X<br>
LC: RC553.N36L38 1983<br>
LCCN: 83-18794<br>
This is a great book, a real classic. Dr. Lowen advances the idea that
narcissism is not falling in love with one's self, but rather with a
false image of one's self. That small subtle difference actually makes
a very large difference. In the original Greek mythology, Narcissus died
&#8212; starved to death &#8212; because he was obsessed with his own image and
stared at it endlessly.
But as Narcissus approached death, his real emaciated appearance could not have
been very attractive. Narcissus was seeing an illusion, not his true
appearance.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Lowen advances the idea that narcissism is often caused
by child abuse and prolonged humiliation and pain in childhood. The child
adopts a persona where he feels no pain and is powerful and invulnerable.
The child thinks, <i>&quot;When I grow up, I'll be so powerful and strong that no
one can hurt me or humiliate me ever again.&quot;</i> Then the child, who grows into
adulthood, spends the rest of his life pursuing and defending an illusion.
Narcissists are obsessed with defending and preserving their image &#8212; they can't
stand it if somebody &quot;makes them look bad&quot; &#8212; they can't stand criticism.
They deny their true feelings and put on a mask of unfeeling, because
they imagine that it will keep them from being hurt again.
Likewise, they completely disregard other people's feelings.
They are obsessed with power and control, so that they can
control the world around them and prevent anyone from humiliating
them again.
Narcissists are often extremely seductive and manipulative people, often charismatic
charmers, and occasionally high achievers as well.
They lie habitually, without giving it a second thought.
They fear insanity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In other words, Dr. Lowen was describing
