From:  	&quot;Mark L&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Orange Papers<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
I just briefly read your Orange Papers. I'd like to ask a few questions,
with the caveat that you keep my name and email confidential.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, Mark,
</font>
<p>
I am actively involved in AA as well as another faith-based group
(example = Overcomer's).  I turned my life around 3-years ago after a
typical downward-spiral.  You probably know dozens of people like me.
For 20 years I was generally healthy, happy, prosperous, and a good
father.  Over time, my problem worsened to the point of complete
despair.

<p>
I am a strong proponent of recovery programs for those who want it and
are willing to do the work.  I lead a small group in my home town, and
many people are there because of the courts or family; and are not yet
ready to participate in the manner I previously described (i.e. willing
to do the work).  Regardless, they are always welcome and treated with
kindness, love, and dignity.

<p>
I do not force my beliefs on anyone; but I have been called upon to help
when asked.  I respond to each request, and this does help me stay
healthy (the 12th step, as you know).   I have seen many success
stories-probably more than 100 by now &#8212; just within my small community.
And, based on my experience, my observation is that the AA program works
100% of the time for those willing to do the work.  People who were
near-suicidal are now living with joy.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I commend you for your desire to help.
<p>
When you say,
<font color="black">&quot;the AA program works 100% of the time for those willing to do the work&quot;</font>,
that is the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">lying with qualifiers</a>, and also
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">cherry-picking</a>.
&quot;Doing the work&quot; really means quitting drinking.
So A.A. seems to work 100% of the time on those people who will quit drinking when you tell them to.
<p>
In addition, just because someone quits drinking does not prove that A.A. works.
Even 100 people quitting drinking do not supply any evidence that the A.A. program somehow made them quit drinking.
It's easy to imagine cause-and-effect relationships where none exist.

<p>
Barry L. Beyerstein, Ph.D., wrote an article,
<i>Why Bogus Therapies Often Seem to Work</i>,
where he explained how informal testimonials are erroneously accepted as
proof of the success of bogus therapies:<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Many dubious methods remain on the market primarily because satisfied
customers offer testimonials to their worth. Essentially, these people say:
&quot;I tried it, and I got better, so it must be effective.&quot; The electronic and
print media typically portray testimonials as valid evidence. But without
proper testing, it is difficult or impossible to determine whether this is
so.<br>
</font>

http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altbelief.html</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
(<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#quack_testimonials" target="_blank">More on that here</a>.)
<p>
One of my favorite &quot;cause stories&quot; is something that I learned in college biology.
My professor was talking about the old theory of spontaneous creation of life,
which was a popular theory in the middle ages.
It was the idea that life could just spontaneously arise out of non-living matter.
One guy who supported that idea published this recipe for the
creation of life &#8212; specifically, for the spontaneous creation of little mice:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Just take a sweaty old shirt, put a couple of handfuls of grain
into it, roll it up into a ball and stick it in the corner of the room.
Come back a month later, and unroll the shirt, and hey presto! You will
have lots of freshly-created little baby mice in there.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, sweaty clothes and grain together cause baby mice to come into existence.
<p>
Another good one is this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
A bunch of people went to a Baptist church for years.<br>
During those years, many of the women got pregnant and had babies.<br>
That proves it:
going to Baptist churches causes women to get pregnant and have babies.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<b><i>Not!</i></b><br>

<p>
Similarly,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
A bunch of people went to A.A. meetings. A few of them quit drinking and stayed quit for years.
So A.A. must have made them quit drinking.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b><i>Not!</i></b><br>
<p>
Also notice how that argument ignores all of the other people who went to A.A. meetings and did not quit drinking.
<p>

And the argument that, <i>&quot;Well, it never happened before,&quot;</i> is also invalid.
It's like,
<font color="green">
&quot;Well, Mary-Lou never got pregnant before she went to that Baptist Church. So that church must have made
her get pregnant.&quot;
</font>
<p>
And,
<font color="green">
&quot;Well, Joe never got sober before he went to A.A., so A.A. must have made him get sober.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Both of those arguments ignore the fact that there are a lot of other things going on at the same time, and
other things can really be the cause of what happened.
<p>
Again, it takes careful controlled testing to establish whether one thing causes another thing.
<a href="orange-letters26.html#RLCS" target="_blank">Read this</a>.
</font>

<p>
Just glancing at your paper, I had difficulty keeping up with the number
of discrepancies between your opinions and mine.  I want to invite you
into an email discussion in hopes we can learn from each other.  You
have obviously been very thorough in your research, and I'd like to be
able to reconcile our differences in opinion.  Please don't think of me
as being self-righteous, as I wouldn't be emailing you if I didn't think
I will learn from you.

<p>
I suspect you are contacted by a lot of angry people who want to goad
you.  That is not my intent.  If you are interested in exchanging ideas
and experience, I would very much be interested in doing do.  If you're
not interested in moving forward, then ignore the rest of my email as I
am going to throw out a few topics for discussion.  I truly hope that
you'd be willing to read my points below and engage in a conversation.

<p>
1.        13th-stepping &#8212; you are sadly right about this.  It is common for
newcomers, particularly vulnerable women, to be preyed upon by men.
This happens.  It is also highly frowned upon and each AA Chairperson (I
am one) is asked that women contact women and man contact men.  And,
when meeting schedules and phone numbers are shared, they are meant to
be within the same sex.  However, AA is loosely organized and there are
sadly many exceptions to this and I find it harmful.  13th-stepping is
one of the most common factors in relapse.  The saying for men is
&quot;behind that skirt is a slip&quot;.
<p>
2.        Insurance Money.  One of your comments indicated that AA is
motivated to recruit newcomers because insurance covers treatment.  This
is not true.  I assume you are referring to professional treatment
centers, which do have a financial stake in &quot;new customers&quot;.  You do not
need to pay to join an AA meeting.  We &quot;pass the hat&quot; to cover expenses,
but this is voluntary.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, of course it is the treatment centers, which are essentially the sales and recruiting arm
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>
3.        Your point: AA groups tend to &quot;hang with winners&quot; and people who
are in continuous relapse are considered outcast and frowned upon.  This
can't be further from the truth-in my experience at least.  There is a
saying that &quot;we don't shoot our wounded&quot;.  People who have recently
relapsed are welcomed with loving and open arms.  In fact, special
emphasis is placed on newcomers or people who have relapsed.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is not what I hear. In fact, I was just answering
<a href="orange-letters110.html#social" target="_blank">another letter</a>
a few minutes ago, and what he said was:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
After the &quot;love bombing&quot; phase had worn off, my skepticism returned and I
couldn't sit through a meeting without believing that everybody was lying.
The steps NEVER made sense to me.  I did a 4th step 3 times in hope that
&quot;something&quot; would happen.  Naturally at the end of 3 years, when I drank wine
at a party, my world crumbled.  My social system collapsed, my status within
the group was gone, &quot;friends&quot; withdrew their friendship.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
I've heard such stories more times than I can count.<br>
Just a quick search brought up these letters with stories of being shunned for
not drinking the koolaid:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters13.html#dumped" target="_blank">dumped</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters21.html#shunned" target="_blank">shunned</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters51.html#bad_sponsor" target="_blank">bad sponsor</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters30.html#shunned" target="_blank">shunned</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters37.html#shunned" target="_blank">shunned</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters40.html#shunned" target="_blank">shunned</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters96.html#shunned" target="_blank">shunned</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters64.html#ostracized" target="_blank">ostracized for thinking</a>
</ol>

</font>
<p>
4.        Cultish and brain washing.  Frankly, some people need their
brain's washed. Please refer to a re-programming point in the AA program
which you consider harmful.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You may think that phrase is cute, but the rest of us find it chilling.
And what a rationalization it is for abuse.
<p>
Notice the similarity of that to other obnoxious cults:
<p>
What the cult leader Rev. Sun Myung Moon of the Moonies said was
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Americans' minds are so dirty,
so full of sex and drugs and sin, that their brains need a good
washing.&quot;
</font>

<p>
The leader of the Synanon pseudo-recovery cult,
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#Dederich_washing" target="_blank">Chuck Dederich, said</a>,
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
&quot;Of course, we brainwash in Synanon. The dirty brains we get
all the time need to be washed for Chrissake!&quot;<br>
</font>
<p>
Oh yes, the cults are eager to wash your brain out for you.
<p>
Now, a reprogramming point in A.A. that is harmful:
<p>
<ol>
<li> teaching self-denigration.

<li> teaching that you can never recover.

<li> teaching that you are sinful and full of character defects and moral shortcomings.

<li> teaching that people drink alcohol because they have sins that they have not confessed.

<li> teaching that practicing a cult religion will cure alcohol abuse or addiction problems.

<li> teaching people that they cannot trust their own thinking.
<li> teaching people to talk and think in slogans and thought-terminating clich&eacute;s.

<li> inducing phobias and teaching people that they will die drunk if they leave A.A.

<li> teaching that the A.A. program is perfect, and if it doesn't work for you, it's because you
were born defective and are constitutionally incapable of being honest with yourself.
<li> teaching people to distrust outsiders, and just associate with other A.A. members.
<li> telling people not to take their doctor-prescribed medications.
<li> telling young girls to
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">have sex with older sponsors</a>
so that they will learn &quot;how to have sober sex&quot;.
<li> teaching people to expect a miracle, and expect God to just suddenly remove the temptation to drink alcohol,
&quot;without any thought or effort on our part.&quot;
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, William G. Wilson,
Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, pages 84-85.</font>
<li> teaching people that they are selfish and egotistical and thinking wrong when they see illogical contradictions
in the sermons of William Griffith Wilson.

</ol>

<p>
There are probably dozens more, but that's what I can think of off of the top of my head.

</font>
<p>
5.        Religion.  AA is very careful to avoid specific religions and
spiritual world views.  However, belief in a &quot;higher power, which cares
about you, and can heal you&quot; is at the core of the program.  This is a
big obstacle for people who have had bad experiences with religion (and
the flawed people that run then).
<p>
<font color="blue">
Umm, no. That is just more of the standard A.A. double-talk. Alcoholics Anonymous actually
teaches a very specific, very peculiar, concept of God:
a micro-managing vindictive male tyrant who tortures people with
<a href="orange-letters11.html#lash" target="_blank">the lash of alcoholism</a>
in order to drive them into the one
and only true religion &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous, where the A.A. God will:
<ol>
<li> make you quit drinking and manage your unmanageable life for you (Step One).
<li> restore you to sanity (Step Two).
<li> take care of your will and your life for you (Step Three).
<li> listen to your confessions and maybe give a Rat's Ass about them
(and, presumably, then grant absolution without a priest assigning any penance) (Step Five).
<li> answer your prayers, and remove all of your &quot;defects of character&quot;
and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot; (Step Seven).
<li> answer your prayers, and teach you by sending you information and guidance, and
sending you work orders for the day and the power to do the work (Step Eleven).
<li> give you a religious or spiritual experience (Step Twelve).
</ol>
<p>
I do not know of any other religion in the world that describes God that way.
</font>
<p>
6.        AA renders people to wallow in their guilt.  That is completely
false.  People with drinking problems and addictions do bad things when
they are actively drinking &#8212; lying, cheating, and stealing.  Guilt and
fear are barriers to healing.  Therefore, the AA program has specific
steps to bring past wrongs to light in a private, anonymous way.  And,
people are encouraged to make amends for past wrongs.  This clears the
way for a better way of living.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I totally disagree here. A.A. has people wallowing in guilt so much that
many commit suicide.  The whole purpose of Steps 4 through 10 is to
induce guilt. They are all about your wrongs, and defects of
character, and moral shortcomings, and more wrongs to other people.
Then you do it all again and again, in an infinite loop.
Not one line tells you to look at
the bright side of life, or to be positive and cheerful, or to love. Not one line.

</font>
<p>
7.        You cite a low success rate.  However, the program does work,
and the promises do come true, if people are willing.  The revolving
door is a result of people deciding they are not ready.  Thankfully,
&quot;bottoms&quot; are rising.  At the time AA was founded, it was the hardest
cases that went into AA and turned things around.  Now, people are
healing earlier in the downward spiral.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are lying with qualifiers &#8212; &quot;If people are willing.&quot;
 And when the A.A. program doesn't work, I guess they weren't willing enough, right?
<p>
But if you are willing to quit drinking, and stay quit, by using your
own determination and will power and common sense, and then give the
credit to the A.A. program, then it will look like A.A. works.
And then it will look like you are willing enough.

<p>
The story that A.A. worked in the early days is just another untrue myth. Read about
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">the real historical A.A. success rate here</a>.
</font>
<p>
8.        You cite AA &quot;leaders&quot; who have been involved in criminal
activity.  That does not invalidate the program or the message.  It
simply points out that people are flawed and some resort to had
behavior.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that is some classic
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">minimization and denial</a>.
All those years of &quot;spiritual practices&quot;, and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">the A.A. leaders still commit perjury</a>
against A.A. members who are &quot;carrying the message&quot; to poor
 alcoholics, in order to get them fined or imprisoned, so that the A.A.
 headquarters can illegally collect royalties on more expensive copies
 of out-of-copyright versions of the <i>Big Book</i>, and that's okay by you?
<p>
What are you going to do about it?
<p>
And more to the point, what <i>can</i> you do about it? <i><b>Nothing</b></i>,
 because A.A. is a fake democracy.
You can vote all you want, and the criminal leaders in The Interchurch Center
 in New York City will just ignore you.

</font>
<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
9.        Abstinence versus recovery.   You have an interesting point on
this and I agree with you to some degree.  Some people mature out of a
drinking problem without being &quot;dry drunks&quot;.   However, my personal
experience is that most people who are true alcoholics, who stop
drinking on their own will, are not in recovery.  They are still bound
by fears and resentments, and are not living a serene life.  They tend
to me miserable until they &quot;work the program&quot;.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That sounds like a very subjective view. Serene lives are something that I found to be
entirely missing from A.A. meetings.
</font>
<p>
10.        Your point:  Absolving our responsibilities, duties, and
obligations to &quot;God's Will&quot;.   The opposite is true.  We teach &quot;do the
right next thing&quot;, &quot;meet our moral and financial obligations&quot;, and &quot;live
our lives with honesty and caring toward our fellow man&quot;.  I think what
you are hinting at is humility.  Human nature sometimes drives us to
think we are more powerful than we really are.  That is why we focus on
the serenity prayer.  This doesn't mean we shouldn't be good parents,
work hard, pay our bills, and be charitable.  It's simply recognition
that a lot of us view life like a movie director &#8212; being able to
position people, places, and things exactly the way we want them to be.
That just doesn't happen and we need to know our limits and bounds of
influence.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is kind of garbled &#8212; &quot;Absolving our responsibilities&quot;???
 Maybe you meant some other word than &quot;absolving&quot;?
<p>
As far as the rest of that paragraph goes, it is just the standard A.A.
put-down of the stereotypical alcoholics.  Bill Wilson delivered the
same rap in the <i>Big Book</i>, about how we all want to be the director
of the show.  And Bill's answer was that we had to surrender to the cult
(aka &quot;Higher Power&quot;) and obey somebody else.
That is pure cult talk.

Subject:  	The AA Program<br>

<p>
I am reading the &quot;Orange Papers&quot;.
Enjoying what you have to say. You have reaffirmed
my thoughts on the AA program. The  higher power of my understanding is Google,  it
led the way to your site. Looks like the old saying that knowledge is power may just
be true after all.
<p>
2 years ago I got sick and tired of my drug use. I quit. Changed
my attitude and behavior. I am currently living in a three quarter house that has
rules that I must attend 4 AA or NA meetings a week. Well I'm moving next week. I
haven't bought into the AA premise that their way is the only way. I just watched
the Penn and Teller show bullshit that was on 12 step programs, very good. I've been
going to a couple of meetings a week, but pretty much keep my mouth shut, the last
time I went, the &quot;table leader&quot; and I got into it when I started
talking about the real history of AA.
<p>
Well anyway, I'm glad you have your site on the web. Now I make
the decision to use, or not use. Much simpler program.

Subject:  	The word &quot;Conception&quot;<br>

<p>
The word &quot;conception&quot; (incl. &quot;Conceptions&quot;) is used 18 times in the
book Alcoholics Anonymous. You claim this is bad english. Yet a quick
reference to a dictionary yields:

<p>
<pre>
Conception |k?n?sep sh ?n|
noun
1 the action of conceiving a child or of a child being conceived : an
unfertilized egg before conception | a rise in premarital conceptions.
? the forming or devising of a plan or idea : the time between a
product's conception and its launch.
2 the way in which something is perceived or regarded : our conception
of how language relates to reality.
? a general notion; an abstract idea : the conception of a balance of power.
See note at idea .
? a plan or intention : reconstructing Bach's original conceptions.
? understanding; ability to imagine : he had no conception of politics.
DERIVATIVES
conceptional |- sh ?nl| |k?n?s?p??nl| |k?n?s?p?n?l| adjective
ORIGIN Middle English : via Old French from Latin conceptio(n-), from
the verb concipere (see conceive ).
</pre>
<p>
I submit to you, that the noun is meant in the second, rather than
first, usage in this definition.
It's not a major issue, just one of your many, many misunderstandings
and misinterpretations on your site.

<p>
None the less, you do provide a useful (albeit partisan) archive of
much that is useful.

Hello Malcom,
<p>
Thanks for the letters.
<p>
Yes, I've given up on the argument about &quot;conceptions&quot;. I still think it is
archaic stilted English, using a long word where the shorter &quot;concepts&quot; will
do the job nicely, but if Bill Wilson wants to write in a euphemistic,
stilted style, well, I can't change him now.

Subject:  	The term &quot;God&quot;<br>

<p>
Hi Orange.
<p>
I think it is number 82 of the 100 questions on weather AA is a
cult that you reference God . An important part of that is of course your
opinion and views on what &quot;God&quot; is. What is essential is to understand what
Step 11 talks about when it uses the same word.
<p>
P. 46 uses some alternative terms &quot;Creative Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Spirit of the
Universe&quot; &quot;Totality of Things&quot;. And, of course &quot;Him&quot; familiar in the
abrahamic religions.
<p>
I read in a reply to one letter you quoted a great hero of mine &quot;Ram Dass&quot;.
He has an excellent Audiobook called &quot;Experiments in Truth&quot; which contains
the talk &quot;What isn't God?&quot;. It cleared up much confusion for me.
<p>
You make much ridicule of the idea that one may pick ones own idea of what
&quot;God&quot; is by referring, and this is legitimate, to bed pans and doorknobs
etc. On one level this is of course ludicrous, but it serves your agenda of
ridiculing AA without referring to a very ancient spiritual belief still
common in Buddhism, Shinto, Voudon, Hinduism and I believe Catholicism (as
it is practiced here in Ireland), namely Animism. The belief that temporal
objects do have an inherent spirit, independent of an external deity.
<p>
Before we come to the Steps on p.59, we are asked to consider some ideas in
&quot;We Agnostics&quot;. But the author makes clear on p.47 what he means when the
term &quot;God&quot; is used:
<blockquote>
&quot;When, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of
God. This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions which you find in
this book.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>
You claim AA heretical, but to which Religion? Your assumption that it is
Christianity is not borne out by a direct reference to that belief.
Alcoholics Anonymous is a book, and no where in it does it refer directly to
an organized religious doctrine. If you own a copy of As Bill Sees It,
perhaps you will refer to 34 and Bill's views on AA being defined
or perceived as a Christian movement.
<p>
Ah well,<br>

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Malcolm.
<p>
I am specifically referring to the Christian religion when I say that the
12 Steps and other A.A. practices are heretical &#8212; 
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">look here</a>.
I refer to Christianity for two reasons:
<ol>
<li> most Americans are Christians, and
<li> many A.A. members insist that the 12 Steps are based on the Bible.
</ol>
Look at these letters, especially the last one, where somebody insists that
the Twelve Steps are derived from a list of Biblical quotes:
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-letters4.html#Biblical" target="_blank">12 Steps Biblical</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters4.html#Biblical2" target="_blank">12 Steps Biblical</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters11.html#Biblical" target="_blank">12 Steps Biblical</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters17.html#Biblical2" target="_blank">Biblical references</a>
</ol>
<p>
Now personally, I have no problem with people thinking for themselves, and
deciding on their own ideas of God. In fact, I recommend it.
<p>
But it is the height of insanity to make up a God like Doorknob Almighty or
Baal Bedpan or Magnificent Mountain, and then bet your life that It
will perform miracles for you and save your life:

I do have a copy of <i>&quot;As Bill Sees It&quot;</i>.
I try to have a copy of everything that
Bill Wilson wrote, or that AAWS published. (I don't have it all yet, but I'm
trying.)
In that book, I see that Bill was once again delivering his
&quot;any religion&quot; speech. What Bill
ignores is that the theology of Alcoholics Anonymous is totally incompatible
with all of those religions.

&quot;While A.A. has restored thousands of poor Christians to their churches,
and has made believers out of atheists and agnostics,
it also has made good A.A.'s out of those belonging to the Buddhist,
Islamic, and Jewish faiths.
For example, we question very much whether our Buddhist members in Japan would
have ever joined this society had A.A. officially stamped itself a strictly
Christian movement.
<p>
&quot;You can easily convince yourself of this by imagining that A.A. started among
the Buddhists and that they told you that you couldn't join them unless you
became a Buddhist, too. If you were a Christian alcoholic under these
circumstances, you might well turn your face to the wall and die.<br>

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Bill Wilson started off by declaring that A.A. was not officially allied with
any church. That's politics. So was his boasting about
restoring poor Christians to their churches.  That is good for a few
Brownie Points with the Christian churches.
Then Bill bragged about converting atheists and agnostics.
That's good for 10 more Brownie Points with the fundamentalist
Christians.
<p>
Then Bill declared that the Buddhists would not have joined if A.A. had
declared itself officially Christian. That's true. And that is just a recruiting
trick: get more victims by raiding all churches and all religions,
and insisting that the A.A. religion does not conflict with anybody else's
religion (when it does).
<p>
It is all just a bait-and-switch trick. First, Bill declares that A.A.
is not aligned with any church or religion, and then he sells you his
own peculiar religious beliefs. A.A. is loaded with those bait-and-switch
tricks:
<p>
<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#believe_everything" target="_blank">First, A.A. tells you that
&quot;A.A. requires no beliefs,&quot; but then you have to believe
everything they tell you, and have blind faith in the proclamations
of Bill Wilson.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#anyGod" target="_blank">First, prospective new members are offered a
tolerant, open-minded &quot;spiritual&quot; program, but then they get
narrow-minded demands for belief in Bill Wilson's teachings.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#keep_your_religion" target="_blank">First, you can keep your own religion,
and then you can't.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#surrender2God" target="_blank">First it's &quot;Surrender to God&quot;
and then it's &quot;surrender to some A.A. members&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education" target="_blank">First, it's <i>&quot;any God as you
understand Him&quot;</i>, and then it's <i>&quot;You don't understand
God. You are 'confused' and 'prejudiced'.&quot;</i></a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#any_religious" target="_blank">First, declarations of Religious Freedom,
and then demands for Religious Conformity.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater" target="_blank">First, a loosely-defined &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
and then an explicitly-defined &quot;God&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#kind_of_God" target="newwin24">Redefine God. First you get one God,
then you get a different God.</a>
</ul>

<p>
Alcoholics Anonymous is really a Buchmanite religion.
They practice the religion of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman,
which Bill got from Frank's Oxford Groups. Bill Wilson
even admitted as much, later, much later, after the heat over
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#theocracy2" target="newwin21">Buchman's praise of
Adolf Hitler</a> cooled off:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got it's ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
Bill Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.
</blockquote>
</font>
<p>
(Notice how Bill Wilson still avoided mentioning the name of Dr. Frank Buchman.
Bill cited the name of the number-two man in the organization, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.)
<p>
The Catholic Church found Frank Buchman's religion to be so heretical that
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban" target="newwin22">they banned his organization twice</a>.

Have a good day.

Long Beach man who shot his AA sponsor during a meeting sent to prison<br>
11:30 PM Fri, Nov 07, 2008<br>
Posted by: PE News<br>

<p>
A Long Beach man who shot and killed his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor at an AA
meeting has been sentenced to 50 years to life in prison.

<p>
Jurors convicted Scott Gordon Reynolds of the first-degree murder of 33-year-old
Uriel Noriega and he was sentenced Thursday by Superior Court Judge Jesse Rodriguez.

<p>
The 29-year-old defendant testified he snapped after Noriega told other members at
an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting two years ago that Reynolds is gay, a secret
confided by Reynolds to only his mother and AA sponsor.

<p>
Reynolds claimed he brought the weapon to the meeting at St. Luke's Episcopal Church
because he planned to commit suicide in front of fellow AA members.

<p>
Prosecutor Patrick O'Crowley says &quot;none of that was substantiated&quot; during trial.

Hello Michael,
<p>
No, that has not been clinically proven. If you believe that it has, please
point me to the clinical studies that established such a fact. Where were they
published, and when?<br>
Thank you.
</font>
<p>
no
matter what book you quote no matter how much time you devote to your website...in
all your honest work and hours upon hours you search and study the faults in these
programs and in these books..alot of people who come through the rooms are lost
souls...never seen a book or had normal human contact (due to people being scared of
them, feeling out of place with their diseases mentally, emotionally, and physically
ect.) in over 30 years...lost in their addiction..sometimes 10 years, sometimes
5...whatever the case may be... its a disease of the mind, of the brain, chemically
different and we altered it even more by drugs and alcohol as well as by our
enviornments that we were either raised by and/or accustomed ourselves to on a
regular degrading level...on top of this disease of our minds that
genetically is given and proven to us even prior to birth ...
many of us have mental
and emotional diseases/disorders that are also given to us prior to birth as well
and/or by products of our upbringingings and/or drugs and alcohol
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, there is no such disease as &quot;alcoholism&quot;. There are just people
who drink too much alcohol, for a variety of reasons.
<p>
Now it is true that many alcoholics suffer from mental illness, and that is
why they drink too much. But that isn't &quot;alcoholism&quot;. That is mental illness.
<p>
A couple of genetic factors have been found that increase the risk of alcoholism,
but that is all. Just <i>increase the risk</i>. There is no gene that <i>causes</i>
people to drink too much alcohol. There is no gene that makes people born alcoholics.
</font>
<p>


...whatever it
may be...the reason why the vast majority fails to recover from alcoholism is
because our overwhelming psychotic disease of alcoholism (which is only a title,
has nothing to really do with alcohol in my perspective but no body really says it
because it appeals to many and majority do actually have issues with alcohol
because alcohol reduces the pain caused emotionally and mentally from our actual
disease and other diseases ...
formed by our chemically unbalanced brains)  is the
fact that no one who starts using serious drugs and alcohol and/or mixes the two,
really wants to stop...that life is complete bliss ..
<p>
<font color="blue">
The American Psychiatric Association does not recognize the existence of any
such disease as the &quot;psychotic disease of alcoholism&quot;. That is an A.A. myth.
<a href="orange-DSM-IV-195.png" target="newwin22">Look here</a> for the relevant
page of the DSM-IV.
</font>
<p>


its not normal for an
alcoholic/addict not to partake in addictive/alcoholic/drug things..chemically
thats how are brains need to be to even be anywhere near close the level as anyone
elses...
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is completely false. 
</font>
<p>

PROBLEM DRINKERS are a whole different story...im talking about the
physical DISEASE of the mind...doesnt matter which one....programs help plenty of
people ,who are OBVIOUSLY anonymous (therefore you would not know of them or their
success rate), live their lives better more holy and at least make them and their
families and others around society feel better for whatever ammount of time they
actually have to be normal and living normally sober (something you seem to do
fine, something that is hard for plenty of people to actually achieve)  free of
obsessions to actually drink/drug....
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are trying to declare that &quot;alcoholics&quot; are a different kind of
creature than ordinary people. They aren't.
</font>
<p>

why would you ever bash on any such programs,
not all the people in the rooms of programs are PROBLEM DRINKERS  ...not all
problem drinkers have this DISEASE ....its a DISEASE of the mind...and its free of
charge...no body has to pay for it..why are you complaining it
never hurt anyone...an alcoholic is always an alcoholic an addict is always an
addict theres no changing .... you cant do it. its a chemical make up... something
for you to easily grasp would be something like---maybe-- since you are so off
....ask any cigarette smoker even one who has quit ffor 20 years...same shit
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, there is no such disease as alcoholism, and alcoholics are not fundamentally
different from normal people. Sicker, yes, when they are drinking too much,
but not fundamentally different.
</font>
<p>

..i
feel so sorry for any young or mature human being that comes accross your page and
gets the wrong message...because you obviously are not an addict or diseased in
anyway otherwise you'd know the pain that comes along with addiction...its ffar
more than the drug itself... .. you should look further into the medical makeup of
brains and how they differ before you publish such harmful things that could
possibly keep a suicidal or desperate person from help, you are selfish...i am
being judgemental..but it is selfish

Subject:  	my post was deleted from the sober recovery forums<br>

<p>
Hello A. Orange &#8212; 

<p>
I have been trying to go to some 12-step meetings just for support,
though I know it is going to
get on my nerves before too long. I am glad to have found LifeRing
recovery meetings and will
stick to those instead.

<p>
Anyway, someone posted in the &quot;secular connections&quot; forum about being
disillusioned with their
first AA meeting.

<p>
So I piped in on some of my own experiences throughout the years. I
managed to post a link to
your site in support of what I feel I need to be aware of and that a
person is right to be a little
wary of some of their propaganda.

<p>
So today, I get  private message from the moderator saying my link was removed.
&quot;Your link was removed. We do not program bash here. Thanks for understanding&quot;
(my whole post was removed.)

<p>
So I replied to the whole thread:

<p>
<center><table width="87%" border="6" bordercolor="green" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

&quot;So somehow I get a private message from Alera saying my link to the
orange papers was &quot;program bashing&quot; and it was removed. Plenty of
people talk about what they feel is problematic about AA and I thought
I was in the &quot;Secular Connections&quot; forum. I didn't write the orange
papers. &quot;We do not program bash here,&quot; like I am in kindergarten or
something.

<p>
Anyway, I don't think the SR thing is for me either since you can't
point to anything with independent analysis without it being
considered &quot;program bashing.&quot; I did not post anything with blatant
stupid profanity or online porn. I posted something that helped
educate me on some things.

<p>
You could have at least not dumped my whole post.

<p>
I am quite certain this post will be removed as well.

<p>
Take care everyone and best of luck!&quot;

<p>
I also mentioned that I can understand if she is trying to protect
other people's chances for recovery, but then added, &quot;but there are
two ways to look at that.&quot;

<p>
So, there is no real secular recovery on SR either. It is overrun with
&quot;program&quot; people, even in the secular connections forum.

<p>
I am sticking to my LifeRing meetings and just not making my recovery
such a big effing deal in the end.

<p>
Thank you for your service to people with an open mind.

<p>

Hi Catherine,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. There is an incredible amount of censorship in the
so-called &quot;recovery movement&quot;, isn't there?  If the program is so perfect,
why is it so thin-skinned and intolerant of criticism?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a good life.

Subject: <a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="newwin10">12 step snake oil</a><br>

<p>
hey &#8212; i just found your website on 12 steps as snake oil &#8212; interesting
stuff, well put together, very readable website &#8212; what i am wondering is:how
can something free be considered a snake oil?
<p>
why such a harsh critique of something that seems to help other people even
if you find no value in it?
<p>
and
do you have another method you suggest?

<p>
thanks for any response

Hi Courtney,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Well, first off, it isn't free snake oil. They always
want something &#8212; your money, or your mind, or your soul, or your loyalty, or
your life, or your children.
<p>
Ann Smith, for instance, was selling
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency" target="newwin11">very expensive
in-patient &quot;treatment&quot;</a>
for the imaginary disease of &quot;codependency&quot;.
And Al-Anon will even help itself to your children and
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#Alateen" target="newwin12">mess with their minds</a>.
<p>
The quackery described in the &quot;Snake Oil&quot; web page has not helped so many
other people.
It has probably killed more people than it has helped.
That is what quack medicine does.
<p>

You want a better cure? Well, there isn't any cure for codependency, because there
isn't any such disease as codependency.

<p>
But if you want help with a drink or drug problem, here is a list of groups,
methods, and organizations that seem to be good:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005034/http://www.smartrecovery.org/" target="newwin13">SMART</a>,
<li>

<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005034/http://www.womenforsobriety.org/" target="newwin15">WFS</a> (Women For Sobriety),
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005034/http://www.sossobriety.org/" target="newwin16">SOS</a> (Secular Organizations for Sobriety),
and
<li>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005034/http://www.unhooked.com/index.htm" target="newwin17">LSR (LifeRing Secular Recovery)</a>
</ol>
<p>
You could also try reading some good books on the subject. Check out
<a href="orange-top10.html" target="newwin18">the Top 10 reading list</a>.
<p>
And especially read the web page on
&quot;<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="newwin19">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;shlomo&quot; <br>
Subject:  	A.A as a cult.<br>

<p>
Hi
<p>
The only reason I have for going to A.A is to become sober and feel good
about it.
<p>
I succeeded doing that in A.A for more than 15 years.
<p>
Maybe A.A is a cult as you say. Personally I have not noticed it  but what
interests me is remaining sober.
<p>
In all your writing I have seen nothing about a method that will work in
keeping me sober.
<p>
Maybe I missed it in all those writings but if you are aware of a method
that works please enlighten me.
<p>
I do have an open mind and am ready to try any method that will help me.
<p>
Till now nothing helped except A.A.
<p>
I am open to suggestions and I hope you have some serious ones.
<p>
Sincerely<br>
Shlomo

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Shlomo,
<p>
We are constantly talking about what works. Look here:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters111.html#what_works" target="newwin77">groups and methods</a>

<li>
<a href="orange-letters31.html#what_works" target="newwin79">A list of what works is here</a>.
</ul>
<p>
When you ask for &quot;a method that will work in keeping me sober&quot;, you assume that
something besides you will keep you sober.  That is one of the biggest mistakes
of A.A. dogma. There is no such thing.
Either you will keep yourself sober by not drinking alcohol, or
you won't.  There is no method or group or thing that will do the work for you, and
A.A. doesn't do it either.

<p>
Have a good day.
