Hello Kelly,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments. But in all honesty, I did not save your butt.
You did. You are the one who got a grip and stopped drinking and saved your life.
Congratulations, and have a wonderful life.

From:  	&quot;Nick I.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Thanks<br>

<p>

Hi Orange

<p>

Thank you for the immense amount of research that you have put into this
project. Your seemingly tireless efforts have probably expedited my
escape from AA by a matter of years.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Nick,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Now that is good news.
</font>
<p>

I am an alcoholic, undeniably. Suffering from extreme anxiety problems
and the consequental health problems (I have a terrible case of
irritable bowel syndrome, which has been proven to be tightly connected
with anxiety), I turned to alcohol. When I was drinking, I was able to
temporarily disregard the pain. As a result, I adopted a terrible habit,
one which has only seemed to escape me in the past few months.

<p>

Before I was able to cure myself, however, I found myself forced (by my
wife, family, and psychologist) to enter AA. My first experience in AA
was a pleasant one; I found a large number of people who seemed to care
a great deal about me. Several individuals actually spent a number of
hours after the meeting indoctrinating me into their cult. The manner in
which they spoke to me in fact relaxed me greatly, and soon thereafter,
I found myself citing AA slogans and perpetually referencing a God that
I had never before believed in.

<p>

My optimistic attitude towards the program changed drastically, however,
when I actually got my hands on a copy of the &quot;Big Book.&quot; Being a
professional student, I immediately read the whole manuscript from start
to finish. Very quickly, I began to realize that AA wasn't a program to
help one stop drinking; it was a program designed to indoctrinate one
into a cult. The chapters &quot;To Agnostics,&quot; &quot;For Wives,&quot; and &quot;Working With
Others&quot; disturbed me significantly, and, at the AA meeting the next day,
I expressed my newfound concerns immediately. I was greeted with a
variety of responses, ranging from &quot;You should only read a couple pages
of the Big Book at a time,&quot; to &quot;the book is very old, and you shouldn't
take everything seriously.&quot;

<p>

These responses did not convince me, and, after a conversation with my
sponsor, I decided to switch into the Narcotics Anonymous program,
which, in their literature, deal with addictions in a softer, less
antagonizing approach. Ultimately, however, I decided that the two
programs were essentially identical, despite the differences in wording.
I should add as a footnote to this that my AA/NA sponsor is a wonderful
woman, and her interests in my recovery were 100% genuine. She remains a
trusted friend of mine to this day (more on this in a bit).

<p>

Because of my inherent distrust of the literature, I began searching the
Internet for answers. Thankfully, I quickly stumbled upon your website.
As an academic, my confidence in your work was greatly increased by the
fact that you cite everything that you write down. Following the links,
and reading your citations, I realized that what I had always suspected
to be the truth was, in fact, true. For that, I am eternally greatful to
you, Orange, because, without the discovery of your research, I might
have toiled for many more years in the AA/NA cult. I was actually
getting to the point where I was actively recruiting new members, and,
on one occasion, almost &quot;13th stepped&quot; a new member. This girl remains
in AA, while still keeping in contact with me, but I am afraid to
criticize her program, as this may confuse her; she seems to believe the
AA dogma and has improved her life greatly. She has a wonderful child,
and I do not want to interfere in her progress in any way.

<p>

Nonetheless, I myself have completely escaped from the AA/NA cult. After
carefully reading through your website and the associated references,
I IMMEDIATELY extricated myself from all 12-step activities.
Subesquently, I began participating in both SMART and Rational Recovery,
and these two programs have done wonders for my alcoholism. I am
currently 6 months sober (interestingly enough, I would go weeks at a
time sober in AA followed by intense binging periods &#8212; afterall, it is
a disease I am powerless over). Once I realized that I was ABSOLUTELY
NOT powerless over my addictions, a new world opened up for me. Now I
had no excuse; I had to recognize that my addictions were mere figments
of my impotent regions of my brain.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Far out. Right on. Exactly.
</font>
<p>

I was on the brink of becoming a full-fledged AA cult member; but thanks
largely to you, Orange, I escaped with as little damage as possible.
Nowadays, it absolutely shocks me how much AA dogma has become almost <i>a
priori</i>
in today's society. Even my parents use words like &quot;relapse&quot; and
&quot;alcoholism&quot; EXACTLY how AA defines them, despite the fact that neither
of them have EVER had any experience with the AA program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, it is amazing how many people parrot the A.A. tenets without even questioning them
or realizing where they came from. A.A. has arrogated to itself both the privilege of
defining the &quot;disease&quot; of alcoholism, and its (cult religion) treatment.
</font>
<p>

I should note that I am from Canada, where it seems that the AA
propoganda machine is not as influential as you describe it as being in
the US. The alcoholism counsellors that I have spoken with have
frequently described AA in a negative light (although I may just be a
lucky exception); however, they DID send me to an addiction specialist
who was a proud member of AA. Nonetheless, the forcible indoctrination
of many individuals into the AA program is a potentially disastrous
policy that could, in fact, drive more people to lethal alcoholism than
if they were simply left alone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, really.
</font>
<p>

As a final comment, I would like to thank you personally with regards to
the abolishment of my nicotine addiction. Many of the websites that you
reference on your own site deal with addiction, although the majority of
them do not deal with nicotine specifically. It is because of your own
PERSONAL explanations of nicotine abuse that I finally decided to quit
the habit (going on almost 6 months now!); coincidentally, I picked up
the smoking bug while attending AA meetings &#8212; thankfully I never picked
up the coffee bug, which I find equally deplorable.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Alas, I still have that one bad. I'm sitting here with a good strong Latt&eacute;
right now. And I must confess to being an enthusiastic coffee addict.<br>
<i>&quot;There is no reality before the morning cup of coffee.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>

Thank you so much for the time and effort, Orange. I will channel your
efforts whenever dealing with an individual plagued with addiction.

<p>

Cheers! And have a great day!

<p>

&#8212;Nick

<p>
(P.S. &#8212; don't include my email address; I don't think I can deal with
all those AA nutjobs who could fill up my inbox)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the story and all of the compliments, Nick, and you have a good day too.
<p>
And congratulations on your escape from the madhouse.

From:  	&quot;Carol&quot; <br>
Subject:  	interesting similarities...<br>

<p>

I just finished a book describing the birth of the SIDS movement in the 70s and how
one doctor was so convinced by his sleep apnea theory of crib death (later proven
false), he obtained millions of dollars for his research primarily with his skillful
orations.  His 'research' was so influential people believed SIDS ran in families
when in fact the common link was, sadly, infanticide.
<p>
But people wanted so badly to
believe he had the answers they ignored the obvious flaws. His work spawned an
entire industry of baby monitors and used the 'fact' that the majority of the
monitored babies lived as proof they worked. Of course they would have survived
anyway and probably been much happier without them.
<p>
And those babies that died,
well, they didn't have SIDS-apnea. (see the similarities?) Years of research and
millions of dollars wasted that could have been spent on real research, all because
of one passionate but very wrong man. Since this emperor was shown to have no
clothes, perhaps the 12-step cure will be debunked as myth in the future. While it
might be easier for people to rail against mistreatment of infants as opposed to
addicts, I still have hope that the truth will prevail. Eventually, common sense
rules.
<p>
P.S.<br>
Perhaps this is why I was told to stop reading books in rehab. Yup, &quot;reading is bad,
it's like drinking (say what?!!)  you do it alone and get all into yourself&quot;
(whatever!) The only book you should be reading, I was told, is the big
book.....talk about indoctrination!

From:  	&quot;Michael M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Wikipedia<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
I don't think that you can clarify your cult-bashing message any more
clearly on your website, any further perhaps, without mucking up the
waters.  Originally, I found your website through Wikipedia.  I was
surfing through the AA page and I saw the Orange Papers at the bottom
and your page looked rather benign.  Little did I know.
<p>
Anyway,
Wikipedia has grown tremendously popular and I have been trying to edit
several nefarious pages, regarding Wilson and Buchman.  Particularly I
was slammed on the Oxford Group page.  I tend to be rather course and
lack subtly.
<p>
There seems to be a rather influential &quot;God squad&quot;
commandeering the input on those pages.  They want to illustrate Buchman
and Wilson as palatable saint like figures, rather than the degenerate
squanderers they really were.   My input lacks coherency and credibility
and I don't have the patience to figure out how to annotate, etc...
<p>
Are you able to find a volunteer, or perhaps do it yourself?  I believe more
people will find out what kind of people Buchman and Wilson were through
the Wikipedia venue, unfortunately, than through your Web page; at the
time being.  If done correctly, I believe there would be a strong case
manifested vs. Cults that are pardoned and practiced throughout the US
and world.

Hi Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Ho boy would that be a project. I have been deliberately
avoiding getting into the Wikipedia Wars because I knew that it would be a battle royale.
<p>
So far, I'm just struggling to get caught up on my email, and that would be a very
time-consuming debate. I am hesitant about getting into it, but thinking about it.
<p>
Does anyone else want to take on the job?

Subject:  	Hello &#8212; long time no hear!<br>

<p>

RE: Blamedenial.co.uk and its closure

<p>

Orange,

<p>

I hope you are well and that my last few emails have not raised the same
doubt they have raised in me!!!! Just to clarify....

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I wanted to write something more substantial regarding my decision to keep
the site open for another year. In all honesty I never ever wanted to close
the site but I felt under pressure from some people in my life, as well as
by my own feelings at the time. I was under the illusion that breaking away
from the dogma that is AA and all that it had instilled in me was purely a
one off decision; I was mistaken.
<p>
Perhaps this is not the case for many of
you, but for me it had been so deeply ingrained in me that as soon as I
decided to close the site I could sense my mind was falling back into the
ways of the 12 Steps. When you have believed in something for 8 years, and
aspired to live up to the so-called spiritual perfection Bill Wilson makes
sure we are never quite able to attain, it takes more than a mere decision
to move on.
<p>
I got caught up in that whole ideology of living your life
simply to better the lives of others that AA tells us is the road we must
inhabit in order to be happy. I became that chameleon again, I wanted to be
a creator of harmony rather than discord, to misquote Bill Wilson. It could
be argued I was too hasty in my decision to set up Blamedenial and with that
I was not prepared for both the reactions of the people that know me, as
well as those that don't.
<p>
Most of the people in my life support what I am
doing with a  silent approval, and the vast majority of people that contact
me through the site do so because they feel as I do.
<p>
However there has, up
until recently, been a shadow of a doubt over what I am doing and the
message I am sending out to people. That 'Do the Steps or Die' mentality is
so very hard to shake off! Those crippling moments of self-doubt that used
to spurn me to yet another meeting ate away at me begging the question, what
if I am wrong about this?
<p>
During one of those bouts I set about to
investigate the good things in AA, and I was met with much criticism, and
understandably so. Save the fact my delivery of the questions was dire; I
also felt that our cause was a hopeless one, albeit briefly. At the time I
wanted to throw the towel in; to turn my back on AA and those who were in
the process of retreating from it.  Once I felt this, it was not hard to
find reasons to justify any such action &#8212; those reasons are all documented
in the letter I posted on my site on the evening I decided to close it down.
<p>
I was also increasingly becoming conscious of the fact that I could not
support all I was saying with facts. Everyone wants facts about how the
program does NOT work, yet they are quite happy to have none when the script
is flipped and they are asked to believe in it!
<p>
In some respects I felt like
that 'newcomer' in the rooms that is swiftly silenced, but this time I was
silenced by myself; by all those damn messages repeating in my mind that are
carefully delivered in the rooms to quash any belief we might have in
ourselves, in our will. Once I realized this I was fired up with an even
greater desire to expose the 12 Steps for what they are; a war on self!

<p>

Many people in my life questioned what I was doing and hinted at the fact
they believed AA helps people and who the hell am I to question something
that's only purpose is to better the lives of people caught in the grips of
alcoholism or addiction?  As I am sure you all well know, that is a hard
argument to answer to. However I have since realised that is the precise
purpose of this site; to break that denial born of ignorance &#8212; most of those
people have never been to an AA meeting. Their opinions are based on that
ever so dangerous PR machine that AA claims to nullify in its hypocritical
10th Tradition.  When you start to label yourself an addict or alcoholic in
today's 12th Step 'sold' society, you also appear to lose all right to an
opinion on your own condition and its causes; you unwittingly hand your
right to an opinion over to people who have never been where you are, and
that, in my humble opinion, is both wrong and detrimental to the individual.

<p>

That is why Blamedenial remains open and is pleased to hear from all of you.

<font color="blue">
Hi James,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are continuing with it. I like your videos.
<p>
I also wonder now and then if I am being too extreme, or if I have gone off the deep end.
That is human nature, and it is also a sign of sanity. It's a raving nutcase like Bill Wilson who
could never ever stop and question himself &#8212; who was convinced that he was on a Mission From God.

<p>
There is one thing you could do with your videos that would help those of us who like
to collect things, you know &#8212; make them downloadable in some other form,
like .AVI or .MPG. That is, I have a plug-in for Firefox that will download videos from
YouTube, and save them on the hard disk in .FLV form.
<p>
But I don't have a player that will play .FLV videos.
<p>
There is some program that will convert them to more common formats, but it only runs
on Windoze and I'm running Linux. Eventually, I'll find an answer, but I am simultaneously
trying to solve half a dozen other more pressing problems, so that one goes to the bottom of
the list...
<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

Subject:  	Thanks for your site<br>

<p>

Hi Orange &#8212;

<p>

I have read a great deal of your paper on-line and find it well-researched
and enlightening &#8212; with just the right amount of humor to lighten up a very
serious subject.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Kimmarie,
<p>
(What a delightful name.) Thanks for the letter and the compliments.

</font>
<p>

I agree with many of your writings on the 12 Step Program.  My personal
experience?  Over 10 years of being &quot;in and out&quot; of the Program.

<p>

During that time, the longest continuous sobriety I achieved was 8 months.
Program people said that &quot;maybe I just didn't want it enough.&quot;  I'll admit
that was true, especially when I first came in 10 years ago.  But if I was
powerless over alcohol anyway, then what difference did it make if I wanted
to stay sober?

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's a great point. If you are powerless over alcohol, how can it be
your fault and your responsibility to &quot;really try&quot; and
&quot;thoroughly follow our path&quot;?
<p>

(Sung to the tune of &quot;There's A Hole In The Bucket&quot;.)
</font>
<p>

I loved the section in your paper that lists the characteristics of a cult.
Tonight, I read and rated #1 &#8212; #10, then compared my scores to yours.  My
favorite cult Descriptor is #7 &#8212; &quot;Irrationality.&quot;  During my first year in AA, I thought,
&quot;don't these people realize they are using circular logic?&quot;  But, of course,
that question didn't get much play because I was a newcomer and &quot;always
wrong.&quot; (Cult Descriptor #2).  The irrationality of the program drove me
bananas.

<p>

It is comforting to know there are like-minded people when it comes to AA &#8212;
the &quot;last house on the block.&quot;

<p>

But what about making the decision not to drink, and finding some kind of
support for that decision?  I know many people
do it &quot;alone&quot; or without support groups, but I must say that the most
helpful part of AA for me was the group connecting.  And I think I know why.
As human
beings, we are social animals.  People with common interests/beliefs gather
to form tennis clubs, volunteer groups and church congregations. Those
of us with drinking histories feel better when we relate to someone's
drinking story in an AA meeting (and sometimes that reduces the desire to
drink).

Exactly correct. That's why I like to refer people to
<a href="orange-letters65.html#alt_list">any other groups</a>
that won't foist such mind-bending cult dogma on them, like SMART or WFS or whatever...
</font>
<p>

A similar factor is at work when people are drinking together in a bar &#8212;
that feeling of connectedness, of not being alone.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yep. I actually heard one enlightened Baptist minister quote a guy as saying,
&quot;Reverend, you will find more brotherly love in a bar on Saturday night than you will
find in the church on Sunday morning.&quot;
And then the minister said that we need to improve the church.
</font>
<p>

I have looked into SMART meetings and the face-to-face meetings are scarce.
I plan to travel to the nearest one anyway to check it out, but I'm
wondering if you know of any plans to expand this program.  I think I may be
able to benefit from SMART, as would many others.  Also, is SMART
led by a counselor or is it like AA, where the indoctrinated show the
others the way?

<p>
<font color="blue">
First question: yes, it is expanding. Slowly, gradually, there are more meetings in more
cities. And since you are a woman, also check out WFS. It is also growing, and I
hear good things about it.

<p>
Second question: In SMART, laymen facilitate the meetings.
I hope they are more educated than indoctrinated,
but yes, they are amateurs who learned their stuff by going to meetings
(and reading a book or two).

<p>

Hello,

<p>

I just wanted to thank you for your page on 'Alcoholics Anonymous as a Cult'. Being
involved in AA for about a year and having feelings of guilt over leaving, many of
the concerns I had about 'The Program' was addressed in your writings. I can't even
start to tell you how relieved I was to see that I wasn't the first one to see
through that BS. I have heard the same things, I could never make it on my own
without 'The Program', I could never control alcohol, and in the rare event that I
could, I would never be truly happy and at peace with my life unless I stayed with
AA, I would just be a dry drunk.  Being a person with a mind, I split from AA
several months ago, since then my life has not become 'unmanageable', in fact I now
hold a the best job that I've had in awhile, I show up when I'm supposed to and
enjoy my free time when I'm not at work.
<p>
Thanks again, Jim

From:  	&quot;sine nomine&quot;<br>
Subject:  	another person who recovered and owns her accomplishment<br>

<p>

first, i like what you have to say. i do a lot of work with people who
cope by hurting themselves physically
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160731215512/http://buslist.org/phpBB">http://buslist.org/phpBB</a>)
and
oftentimes people suggest using a 12-step model. i'm very against
this, because to me one of the first steps in overcoming any negative
coping method is to realize that every time you pick up that blade or
that bottle or that drug, you are making a choice. it may be that you
don't feel you have any other or any better choices, and that's okay;
the process of recovering means making mistakes and bad choices and
learning from them.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

lapses are learning opportunities. they mean you've run into something
your new ways of coping can't handle, and after the lapse you have the
chance to figure out why. one tool i use frequently is a series of
questions:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
 have you taken care of your physical wounds? if not, go do that
now. we'll wait.

<p>

<li>
 what had happened just before?

<p>

<li>
 what were you thinking and feeling?

<p>

<li>
 why did you end up hurting yourself then instead of some other
time? was there an event that was the final straw? what was it?

<p>

<li>
 how did the situation get to the final straw stage? trace it
back through the events that led up to the last event. look for
some point at which you could have made a different
decision. what made hurting yourself the best option you had at
that time?

<p>

<li>
 were there outside factors like drugs, alcohol, being off your
meds, lack of sleep, etc? can you address those in the future?
how?

<p>

<li>
 what other ways of coping did you try besides self-harm? how
well did they work?

<p>

<li>
 in retrospect, are there coping methods that you now realize
might have helped? what were they?

<p>

<li>
 name at least two things you will do to help yourself remember
those coping methods if you end up in this situation again.

<p>

<li>
 how do you feel about the situation that led to self-harm now?
is it resolved? if not, what are some steps you might take
toward resolution?

<p>

<li>
 are you likely to be in that emotional place again? how will you
recognize it when you're in that situation?

<p>

<li>
 what will you try before you resort to self-harm if you're in
that situation again? list three specific things you will commit
to trying.
</ul>


<p>

these questions actually do help.

<p>

my story:

<p>

after pretty severe abuse and neglect as a child and teen, i was at a
loss when i finally left home. first i was terribly depressed. then i
started going into awful rages at the slightest provocation. after
that, i met some people who had parties every weekend night (and some
weekdays). pretty soon i was getting blitzed every weekend. when i got
drunk, i'd either get suicidal and whiny or furious &#8212; it was like
being drunk gave me an excuse to get the crap out (though of course it
came right back later). then i'd black out. sometimes i woke up in a
puddle of my own vomit. once i blacked out, vomited in someone's
backyard, then came out of the blackout and had no memory of throwing
up.

<p>

i went to some aa meetings, but it wasn't helpful. eventually i
partially replaced drinking with self-injury. i did some pretty
hardcore cutting and burning (i've got two skin grafts from
third-degree self-inflicted burns. i once cut muscle. another time i
made holes in my wrist with wire cutters and put nails in the holes. i
was one fucked-up person).

<p>

eventually i got into a dialectic behavioral therapy program. it gave
me the skills i needed to identify my feelings, cope with them in
non-destructive ways, and be more effective in dealing with other
people. that program saved my life. eventually i stopped drinking. now
i'm a social drinker. back in the day, if i was at a party with an
open bar, i'd drink enough to get buzzed and then keep drinking
because i was terrified of losing the buzz and having to face
reality. now i can take it or leave it. last summer, i went to a
friend's wedding where most of the guests ended up getting very
drunk. i had a glass of champagne, but i didn't want anything else; i
just didn't feel like drinking that day.

<p>

i consider myself to be fully recovered from self-harm and from alcohol
abuse. i don't run from my feelings anymore, and i try to listen to
what they're telling me. it was hard work, but i did it myself without
giving up the power to make my own choices. right now i'm trying to
apply these same techniques to emotional eating.

<p>

i'm glad your site exists. too many people see aa as the one true
path, and it isn't. many many people recover without the program, and
you never hear about them because they're not in the system. i'm an
example.

Hi Deb,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the story. I just couldn't agree more.
<p>
The 12 Steps themselves are a form of self-harm, what with all of the guilt induction and
dwelling on &quot;when you are wrong&quot;, and then telling you that you are powerless
and insane and full of moral shortcomings and defects of character and wrongs....
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better now.

<p>
And have a good day.

<a name="horror"> </a>
Date:  	Wed, August 30, 2006 1:29 pm<br>
From:  	JM<br>

<p>
Dear A.O.:

<p>
Don't know why I'm writing again, just that the fact of you encourages me.
I'm going to have 20 years in September, and was a &quot;low bottom case,&quot; but in
reality, I knew (in the way back when), I was a near-murder victim (four guys
went to jail), and that &#8212; and the horror of the rape crisis center), just sent
me to the bottle.
<p>
And for that, I've been pathologized for twenty years.  I
can't go back there.  Went once last year.  But I feel depressed.  I know my
mind is just unhinging.  But it's true brainwashing.  Like my reality &#8212; and their
reality.
<p>
As I wrote before, out of terror of going back to AA (at first I
went about four years), I hired a therapist later in life, when I got
physically ill, and he was worse.  The thing is, I'm pretty religious  (I read the
Bible a lot), and I just hate all of this!   I mean, there is no normal
reality-based perspective that acknowledges reasons people might pretty reasonably
drink.  I always thought that disease concept was SO HIDEOUS.  I think I'm just
still going through such horrifying sense of betrayal.  Why take young rape
victims &#8212; and tell them they're diseased?
<p>
I mean, I've lived my whole life not
really believing that, but on another level, you sort of do.  It's like a really
horrifying life perspective that you didn't have, on a more core level, but
that is so deeply ingrained from AA, and our culture (the whole country,
really, believes this crap).
<p>
I just think it's a total cover-up, to cover the
reality of life here, and to self-pathologize, so no one looks at larger social
issues.  I mean, lots of young girls &#8212; not just me &#8212; get nearly killed, treated
like garbage by shrinks, and then drink.
<p>
Uh... disease?
<p>
Felt more like
continuous, endless exploitation of the young to me.
<p>
I just hate that so many
people feed on youth and vulnerability.  So many young nights were spent for me, in
those stinky, smoky rooms, often full of the very convicts of the sort who'd
assaulted me.  I know that sounds uncharitable, but I finally became very
reactionary.  I just wish I'd left so long ago.  I've stayed pretty isolated, and
read the Bible.  It's the only thing that makes sense to me.

<p>
Anyway, for the past year, reading your site really helps me.  Just that you
take the time to do this.  The shrink who got ahold of me when I was sick was
even more bizarre than AA.  I ordered many of his published papers, so I can
remind myself, when I doubt he was monster.  But it kills me that so much of
this goes on, there's nowhere to turn for help, you're so alone.
<p>
Hopefully next
week, I really will try to make the Smart meetings you recomended.  I'm in
NYC, which is lucky that way.
<p>
I just feel that, if it weren't for all this AA
and &quot;therapy&quot; hate-ideology, I could have had a great life.  I mean, all those
therapists believe the craziest, crappiest shit about the human subject &#8212; who
we are, why we're here.  To be honest, it really just flays me.  I cry and cry
sometimes.  I've been hurt, but I was never capable of the kind of hate these
people dish out &#8212; calling people diseased, when there's just some obvious
environmental problem, and stuff like that.  It's just so sick.  What the hell is
wrong with people?

<p>
Well, like I said, just the fact that you do this, and that I can read
letters seeing that communications between ourselves is something, is so important.
I would LOVE to connect with any X-steppers in my area.  I am trying to join
that site, but my computer skills suck; anyway, I am figuring it out.  (I have
to do some weird cut/paste thing).  But the thing is, I'm hanging in, and
your site is part of why.  I know if I just refuse to go back, and feel my
feelings, and be honest about my real experiences in AA that other new friends will
come.

<p>
I had one of those &quot;dual lives.&quot;  Like AA convinced me that my &quot;nice&quot; friends
could never accept &quot;my disease.&quot;  When I got sick, (with a real disease), I
lost a lot of my nice world, and only AA was left.  It has been hell.  Deep
down, I really thought I'd escaped from AA, I think.  That I'd ever use it for
support again was heartbreaking.  I hate it so much.  I hate that they would
take a young, confused girl, further endanger her, and make her sit with horrible
people like I met, (who I'm supposed to be like.)  One word for that shit:
never.

<p>
I am grateful for a couple really cool people I met over the years there, but
it was like two &#8212; young, my age, (one got &quot;sober&quot; at 14, I mean, what could
that even mean!).  Anyway, we secretly shared what we thought, and they remain
very dear to my heart.  I saw so many young people die through that, and also,
the really bad therapies that came in tandem with the AA meetings.  For many,
it's a double whammy of the therapists, too.   One guy thought he was
Satanically Ritually abused, when he wasn't.  Another I still talked to thinks she's
an incest victim (but has no memory of this whatsoever; her therapist just
believes it because she was raped later in life &#8212; I'm really not kidding.  On the
basis of this, whole families have been lost.

<p>
Maybe my family wasn't perfect and was &quot;dysfunctional,&quot; but they were MINE.
And anyway, I'm not stupid.  I always figured life can be hard.  I never held
it against family members if they did something untoward (my dad drank some,
and my parents divorced.)  To hear AA and therapist talk about it, you'd think
we were all serial killers.

<p>
Oh, Orange.  My heart just feels a little broken today.   I just started
typing to you, because you get the AA thing.  Like I said the first time I wrote,
two of my sponsers had dead kids from suicide.  You'd have thought that might
stop them from &quot;helping&quot; so many other youngsters.  And I was always nice, and
try to be understanding, and saying things like that, I feel like a bitch.
<p>
But I just wish other adults had been more concerned with these
issues &#8212; helping the younger ones who got stuck in all this.  When I do go to
meetings (very
rare) I just yell about the hell I saw there.  Of course, people in AA around
the neighborhood &#8212; some don't even say hi to me.  And after twenty years of
knowing me!

<p>
Wow.  If there's any evidence it's a cult, that would be it.

<p>
Again, thanks for your work and your heart &#8212; for doing it.  I just feel like
shit right now, and so betrayed.  I know I should have taken more proactive
actions in my own care, but when I first got heisted into this (and that's a
real story), I was very young.  My friend who was forced into sobriety at 14 has
the same confused headset &#8212; like much of our minds were influenced by this,
and we also think it's total sick bullshit.

<p>
Anyway &#8212; like I said &#8212; thanks again.   I still read your site.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, J.M.,

Hello Ted,

Well, I'm not really looking for a debate about religion, although the subject is unavoidable
when you are talking about Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
You say that you &quot;looked for an altar to pray at&quot;, and didn't find one. Well, I know from your
many postings to newsgroups that you were looking for a fundamentalist Christian
thing. I really don't have such an attitude. I just avoid fundamentalism of any kind &#8212; no matter

&quot;Prohibition flowered directly out of the rich soils of the temperance
movement, and yet it only set the stage for a very dismal failure:
Consumption of hard liquor (which was easier to smuggle) rose, while overall
drinking fell. A typical &quot;temperance&quot; culture, the U.S. gave birth to
Alcoholics Anonymous, which has flourished in other temperance cultures,
such as England, Canada, and Scandinavia. Notes Levine, &quot;AA is really a
religious movement that has tremendous continuity with the 19th century
temperance movement. And AA's understanding of alcoholism is the central
understanding of addiction in American culture overall.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Alcohol consumption, especially hard liquor, has seen a steady decline to
74 percent of its mid-1970s record high. Still, 13 million Americans are
alcoholics. As researchers increasingly realize, a society's attitudes about
alcohol strongly impact how individuals handle drinking. In Mediterranean,
nontemperance cultures, wine is as common as bread, and individuals drink
every day without becoming &quot;problem&quot; drinkers. The per capita rate of
alcohol consumption is high; cirrhosis is common; but behavioral problems
from alcohol are rare, and society does not lay the blame for its ills at
alcohol's door.

<p>

&quot;In sharp and astonishing contrast, a temperance culture is highly
ambivalent about &quot;demon&quot; alcohol, which is seen as a significant cause of
our society's problems. In America, for instance, addiction is considered a
root cause of violence. &quot;In temperance cultures, people drink to get drunk.
They tend to drink in short bursts of explosive, binge drinking. Wine
cultures rarely get fall-down drunk,&quot; says Levine.&quot;

there is no rigorous scientific evidence to support some widespread AA
teachings. Some of the disputed myths include:<br>
...<br>
<ul>
<li>
Addicts cannot quit on their own. In fact, say Chiauzzi and Liljegren,
95 percent of smokers stop without the help of peers or professionals,
even though addicted people themselves consider nicotine more addicting
than alcohol. Although only about 20 percent of alcoholics recover solo,
many may not be tapping their ability to do so.
</ul>
<br>
=================================<br>

<p>

That 20 percent number seems way too low. The Harvard Medical
School's &quot;Mental Health Newsletter&quot; reported that 80% of the
people who successfully quit drinking self-destructively did
it alone, on their own.<br>
See:

<p>

So can somebody name the publication from which the authors
were quoting Chiauzzi and Liljegren?

<p>

Thank you, and have a good day.

The whole issue of temperance movements and prohibition is just such a fascinating subject.
<p>
The interesting thing is that the best way to promote a vice is to outlaw it.
That has happened so often in our history that it cannot be a coincidence.
It makes me wonder whether maybe we are really just a bunch of rebellious
hairless monkeys who don't like rules... :-)
<p>
One of my favorite quotes on the subject of Temperance Movements is:

The diagnosis of drunkenness was that it was a disease for which the
patient was in no way responsible, that it was created by existing saloons,
and non-existing bright hearths, smiling wives, pretty caps and aprons.
The cure was the patent nostrum of pledge-signing, a lying-made-easy
invention, which like calomel, seldom had any permanent effect on the
disease for which it was given, and never failed to produce another and
a worse. Here the care created an epidemic of forgery, falsehood and
perjury.<br>

Hi. No relapse. I'm just fine. I've been doing everything from
volunteering for a community project to playing in the sunshine
to repairing my computer. I shall get caught up on some email
pretty soon.

Have a good day.

I said it wrong lol! I meant I didn't think you relapsed lol. I was worried
about car accident or something. Glad to see you're ok!<br>
Cheers.

Hi again Mvega,
<p>
It isn't your fault. It's okay.
<p>
There are just a few wagging tongues out there who are forever hinting that
I have relapsed.<br>
If I go on vacation and goof off for a while, they are sure that I
must have relapsed.<br>
On the other hand, when I work hard on
the web site, they complain that I am &quot;obsessed with proving A.A. wrong.&quot;
<p>
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.
