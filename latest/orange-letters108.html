<font color="blue">
May 25, 2008: Back in the park, Day 8.
<p>
The rain let up, so the goslings got to go to the park in the afternoon.
<p>
Here, they are eating oatmeal.

<p>
Notice how the gosling on the left has white specks in its fur. That's oatmeal. When the oatmeal sticks to the beak of one
of the goslings, it whips its head around and flings off the oatmeal, and a sibling often gets hit with it.
<p>
Also notice how the gosling on the right is picking seeds off of the grass. That's their natural diet.
They love to get the grass seeds, because that's grain, and it is far more nourishing than just blades of grass.
But they are still mainly eating oatmeal because their little mouths are not strong enough to shear off blades
of grass, yet.

</center>

<p>
The previous day, they suddenly got tired of whole wheat bread and refused to eat any more of it.
So I tried some oatmeal &#8212; just cook it up like you would for a human baby, and then cool it down
so it won't burn their little mouths.
At first, they didn't know what it was, or what to do with it. So I put a little on the end of a finger
and prodded their beaks with it. One gosling got the idea of trying a taste of it. The gosling liked the taste and
started eating oatmeal off of my finger. Pretty soon, all of them were doing it. So I showed them the plate
of oatmeal &#8212; warm, fresh, ready to eat. They loved it.
They guzzled it down and gorged themselves. They crammed down as much as they could possibly eat.
Then they laid down beside me and passed out, and slept it off and digested it. Fifteen minutes later,
they woke up hungry, and went back to the plate of oatmeal and gorged again. And then laid down beside
me and passed out and slept it off. Then fifteen minutes later they woke up hungry and went back to the oatmeal
and gorged again. I had put enough oatmeal on the plate to last them all day, I thought, but in half an hour
it was gone and they wanted more. So I gave them more, and they ate more. And then they laid down beside me
and passed out again.
<p>
They ate so much oatmeal that I was afraid that they would die from over-eating.
I was wondering if I had stumbled across a new drug for geese that they just couldn't resist and they
would compulsively eat it until they died.
<p>
Nope, they were just hungry, and they have unbelievable appetites. After that they settled down to merely
seriously eating every fifteen minutes.
<p>
That old line about &quot;you are eating like a bird&quot; is such a joke. If you or I ate like a bird we would weigh
900 pounds.

What is your purpose in attempting to debunk AA organization?  I read

alternative for recovery from alcoholism.

Hi Matt,
<p>
Opinionated? Probably. I cannot pretend to be unemotional about my friends getting dosed with
harmful cult religion.  But I do go out of my way to collect all of the scientific and medically-valid
information that I can.
<p>
We often talk about recovery, and methods of recovery. I won't use the word &quot;alternative&quot;, because
A.A. doesn't work. We don't need an &quot;alternative to A.A. recovery&quot;, we need recovery that works.

This poem is about being led into believing something you know is not true,
but out of fear you believe it and never look to find the truth.

A Verb Called Free</a>
<p>

The sinister sounds of fear induce delusions from its mouth onto innocent
ears.<br>
You're at its mercy now! You should have shut off the sound, not listened,
ran far away.

<p>
Now the beliefs are shared, a new world view, your life has changed, but
change is over, you will stay this way.

<p>
Your eyes gloss over, it's the image of emptiness, lost, right where you're
supposed to be, right where it wanted you all along.

<p>
You try to think but suddenly are disrupted, your thoughts churn with
others' into a mixing bowl of mixed-up thoughts. You are supposed to be
here.

<p>
Truth is near, interrupted you are, danger is lurking, back fast to your
new world view.

<p>
You breathe a half-breath of freedom, suffocated instantly by the drowning
voices of your new society, your new reality.

Thinking thoughts are frowned upon here, a frown of danger, a frown that
drowns all thinking thoughts.

Hi orange-papers.org

<p>
I have read a little on orange-papers.org and
I have to ask this:

<p>
if it was possible to &quot;only as a grant of permission not a
transfere of title to personal download a copy of ﻿paperback to read&quot;
and maybe even save ?!

<p>
To be able to download the whole site orange-papers.org as a paperback
book ?!

<p>
I like the research very much !
 &#8212; even the opinions is personal and only tells about the one who is
writting at the time of the writting as allways, so those
I leave where those belongs as I read.

<p>
But as website leave, disappears as time goes, maybe a grant of
permission to have a personal copy of the website could be an option ?

<p>
and maybe even be allowed to have a copy as a .zip file
( orange-papers.org.zip ) on own personal webpage only ,
as for later reference if one have used a link to one of your webpages
on orange-papers.org that would be a nice option ?!

<p>
Beside that, thanks for the good historical reference, nice work !

<p>
The idea came from a website I'm about to build, www.ttwio.org
that all misic, video so on, could be downloaded in a zip file, to
be watched later &#8212; on a trip or what ever ?!

<p>
(even the file would be big, many start download before they go to bed
and first after the come back form work, the day after, many hours
later ! they want to use there connection again but in those hours many
gb of file can be downloaded ! )

<p>
so to transfere a 4-7 gb orange-papers.org as a paperback book to a usb
memory key or a  8 gb mobile phone can allso be don by night and the
next day I can read in train on my way to work or in lunch time :)

Hello Hardy,

<p>
Thanks for the compliments.

<p>
You can download the whole web site now, in archived form.
See the center of the main page,<br>
<a href="menu1.html#archives">
http://www.orange-papers.org/menu1.html#archives</a>

<p>
There are 16 files to download. I did that because things
like Comcast barfed on one big file, and it just wouldn't
work. But the smaller files get through.

<p>
You can get either the Linux or Windoze format archive files.
You don't need both, as the files contained inside the sets
are the same &#8212; absolutely identical. The two archive sets
are just a convenience for different operating system users.

<p>
It downloads as a web site, rather than a book, though.
I deliberately kept as many links as possible relative,
which means that you can unzip all of the archive files
into one subdirectory (&quot;folder&quot; in Windoweze), and the
whole web site will work properly locally. You can browse
it with any standard browser like Firefox or IE.

<p>
By far, the most convenient thing to do is burn all of it
into a CD after downloading and unzipping. (But you don't
have to do that.)

<p>
Enjoy, and have a good day.

<p>
Hello Agent Orange,

<p>
First I would like to say thank you for your website. I have had a few problems in
my life and I seem to be slowly coming completely out of my 12 steppism. I do love
the ideal of a group to share with but ....a group of sickies can be very dangerous
to me!

<p>
I wonder if you are aware ACA has their own 2006 Big Red Book out now? I have come
across some sick behavior on their website and at the ACA phone bridge meetings. I
am currently banned from their site. I believe it is because I have made it a point
to make them aware they are not staying within their own traditions. The current
charman has his picture in a NACOA newsletter... although he was only an ACA WSO
board member at the time in 2005. There is also currently a board member directly
affiliating her therapy business to ACA. I addressed this to all the board members
and they seem to think I need to stop promoting conflict... yet she still continues
to make money off ACA.

<p>
I have saved a few examples of the moderator abuse I received from three seperate
moderators and the &quot;Letter of Shame&quot; dismissing me from the website. I also have
direct links to these other two examples, if you are interested.

<p>
Sadly ACA seems to be the best game in town that I have found as far as 21st century
psychology recovery groups...(I still have lots of issues with  the 12 steps). If
these first few I met so far in ACA are an example of ACA as a whole these guys seem
to be the sickest on the block! There probably have been lots simply abused then
eliminated from the ACA WSO Forums and probably lots more to come!

<p>
I was warned it may even be a pyramid scam only to sell and promote the ACA Text and
to benefit the others directly linked to ACA. I can provide examples on the ACA WSO
website directly linking The Carom Foundation, Ernie L., and Marty S's personal
work address and his full name.

<p>
It is very possible these are honest mistakes but the fact I have pointed them out
over and over and nobody seems to care is a sign to me that there is something else
going on... and or possibly some major ignorance.... they are all ACA's and  have ACA
issues. What gets me is several board members call &quot;themselves&quot; Oldtimers... I really
hate that!

<p>
Anyway I am building up a dangerous resentment... lol. I will be happy to share all
info I have... but please bear with me I do not have much skills on the  computer.

<p>
I hope to hear from you!

Hi Patrick,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Now that's interesting. I don't know a lot about ACA &#8212; I only
went to one of their meetings, ever. But even at that one meeting I got a jewel of illogic,
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#ACOA2">here</a>.

<p>
But I would not be the least bit surprised to find that the same things go on there as in A.A., N.A., and Al-Anon
meetings. And that there are the same organizational abuses, and people who are only in it for the fringe
benefits, like money and sex.  It just seems to come with the territory.

<p>
Yes, sure, I'm interested in more news, views, and information.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Hello Orange,
<p>
Firstly I want to thank you for your obviously
extensive research displayed on your wonderful site. A new light has indeed
entered the dark world of the alcoholic. The light of reason!!!!.
On reading your material I can't help but think, &quot; how many could
have been saved ?&quot;, had they been privy to the truth exposed here.  I
started extricating myself ( no easy task) several years ago when it became
obvious to me it was doing a lot more harm than good.
<p>
I have not had a drink for many years, unwittingly using the
techniques you yourself have outlined. AVRT etc..

<p>
Have you ever read George Ainslie's &quot;Breakdown of Will&quot;?  I found it to be an absolutely
fascinating book regarding self defeating behaviour, and Kathleen Taylors &quot;Brainwashing&quot; is a real gem.
<p>
Hope you are around for a long time spreading the good news, and
thanks again for so courageously seeking and telling the truth.
<p>
Jack.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jack,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well.
<p>
I also sort of accidentally used the AVRT techniques in my own recovery. I didn't know what to call it &#8212; I was
just aware of the fact that whenever I quit smoking, there was always some little voice yammering about how
we could just have one, it's okay now, we have it under control. And I eventually learned not to trust that
little monster as he tried to talk me into having one.
<p>
And then, when I quit drinking, I noticed that the same voice would argue that it was okay to have a beer.
<p>
And because I quit both drinking and smoking at the same time, he really screamed.
<p>
I also noticed that the little voice was so simple-minded that it could not crave two things at once. It could demand 
a cigarette, or a beer, but not both at the same time. So it would do 55 minutes out of the hour demanding a cigarette,
and then scream for a beer for 5 minutes, and then go back to cigarettes.

<p>
I had a moment of recognition while I was reading
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Trimpey2">Jack Trimpey's <i>Rational Recovery</i></a>,
where I suddenly flashed that, &quot;'The Beast', as Trimpey calls it,
is the base brain &#8212;
<a href="orange-addmonst.html">it's that primitive old lizard brain</a> with all of its basic hungers and drives.&quot;
A lot of things fell into place after that, and it started making sense.
<p>
I find it very helpful to see that the yammering of old lizard brain is not &quot;my thinking&quot;.
It's just a horny hungry old lizard wanting his feel-goods. It has little or nothing to do with me.
<p>
The A.A. teachings
about how your thinking is so messed up, and you can't trust your own mind, and &quot;Your best thinking got you here&quot;
are very damaging and counter-productive.
<p>
Actually, my decision to quit drinking and quit smoking really was my best thinking, so it really was
my best thinking that got me here. (But that isn't what A.A. members mean when they repeat that slogan.)
<p>
I finally got around to putting a library hold on George Ainslie's &quot;Breakdown of Will&quot;, and got the
book, but then got distracted by other things and my time ran out before I read it. So now I have to put another
hold on it and wait until it comes around again. It looks very interesting, from what little I saw of it.
And I should get a hold in on Kathleen Taylors &quot;Brainwashing&quot;, too.
Thanks for the tips.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hello John,
<p>
Yes, we have had some discussions about A.A. with Rick Ross before.
<p>
And actually, he has received many complaints about A.A., but he dismisses them as &quot;not significant&quot;, and then
erases them and bans the people who posted the complaints about Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-rross_aa01.html">Look here for some of the erased messages</a>.
<p>
And what is interesting is that when the story about
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the Midtown Group</a>
broke,
Rick Ross finally posted a message admitting that they were a cult.
But he is still trying to imply that no other branches of A.A. are cults.
<p>
What Rick Ross overlooks, perhaps deliberately, is the fact that most cults have a mild, pleasant, smiley-face
front.  The face that they present to the world is often the exact opposite of the ugly reality within.
He of all people should know that.
So it isn't good logic to claim that the abuses that have been uncovered in many groups
in many states are not common to other groups &#8212; that

<p>
Dear Agent Orange,

<p>
THANK YOU!!!  Thank you for your diligent dedication to expose the truth.

<p>
I am a current nondrinking exmember of AA.  I just got financially screwed over by
my sponsor who had over 20 years.  Currently, I have over a year and 3 months.  Have
not been to a meeting and.... realized that I had grown brain cells and that I can
think for myself.

<p>
Since the beginning I have struggled with the black and white thinking so previlent
in AA.  I have never made any real friends in AA because I felt like I was never
speaking to a normal humanbeing.

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
I do have to say that there have been positive outcomes from going to AA.  I don't
have to hate everything about it.  I do believe that the road to recovery is
focusing on being a spiritual person and turning one's attention to helping others.
However, I refuse to be a doormat and I like my resentment, it reminds me of the
fact that I have a back bone!  AA did distract me long enough to stop the craving,
that is about it because the old timers tend to be messed up and screwed up
assholes.

<p>
People in AA seem to be stuck and it is almost as if they are playing the same movie
where they are the stars.  It seems that the only thing that will earn you respect
in AA is your polished converting AA podium speech.

<p>
Take care.

<p>
Happy, joyous and real.

Subject:  	AA/court ordered psychos/I don't feel safe<br>

<p>
Hello,
<p>
I've read much of what you have to say about AA and agree wholeheartedly.  When
I first decided I wanted to be sober, I chose to enter into an outpatient
rehab.  It was through a faith-based hospital. Before I checked in, I told them
that I did not believe in AA and I hoped that there was no plans to
indoctrinate me into the halls of AA.  I was assured that the hospital based
program was a means to provide me with tools I would need to get sober and
remain sober.  I signed up and began to attend classes. Many were excellent;
cognitive behavior, mindfulness of recovery etc. It definitely took my mind off
of my bleakness and gave me some positive reinforcement to become my self
again.  Being in a fog, I mechanically went to class after class. Then one of
the classes I was registered in was full. So i was offered another class.  This
was called &quot;The steps.&quot;  So I went to that and was told that if I wanted to get
sober and stay sober, I had to first go through Steps 1, 2 and 3 of AA! I told
them I was opposed to AA and had expressed my sentiments prior to registering.
The more classes I attended, the more FEARFUL i became. I was extremely
vulnerable in the beginning of my recovery (who isn't) and I believe that this
was used against me to have me believe there was only one way eventually.  It
DID scare me to hear that if I didn't follow these suggestions, I would surely
die. Hell, I had already thought bleak thoughts already which is why i went for
EMOTIONAL help to begin with!
<p>
The 'teacher' of the Steps class said I had to go to any lengths to remain sober.
And that was to shut up, listen to what i was told (suggested) and do the work.  she
even told me HOW to attend the meetings, and what NOT to say &#8212; especially all the
things I was saying in class.  Such as i did not want to live in fear. God gave me a
brain. I go to MY CHURCH to say the prayers I want to; not because they are
&quot;suggested' in some &quot;big book&quot;. I told her I likened AA as a replacement for those
who are seeking God. Instead they found &quot;the program&quot; which &quot;teaches you a better
way of life.&quot;  So do all churches and religious groups! She said that she was so
committed to AA, that she divorced her husband of 20+ years because he complained
that AA was more important to her than he was.  It was! I found this shocking and
COMPLETELY SELFISH.
<p>
So I was told that in order to 'graduate' from this program, I had to attend at
least 3 meetings a week, get a home group and get a sponsor.  I said no.  but I was
getting good stuff from some of my classes so I didn't want to get kicked out.  Now,
I'm not a weak person but when I say I was vulnerable, I mean it. I chose to get
sober and said goodbye to everyone I know, my lifestyle etc. everything I KNEW to do
before being told what to do.
<p>
So I finally figured out that the &quot;rehab&quot; was a crock, and quit.  I had a sponsor by
now and was scared that if I didn't go to meetings, then I would go &quot;back out&quot; and
then I would commit suicide, like two people in the program had done recently.  I
questioned if these women had a history of mental imbalances or depression and was
told that that probably had little to do with their suicides; it was because they
left the program.  I knew this wasn't true, but after months of going to meetings,
getting with a sponsor, being in the program I BEGAN TO DISBELIEVE WHAT I KNEW WAS
THE TRUTH. The program helped these poor women make their fateful choices. as I got
stronger, I began to question more and more. I was finally told that if I go to
meetings, I must keep my negative thoughts to myself. that if I were to speak, it
was to be in favor of the program. so I shut my mouth. I did meet people I really
liked and admired how they conducted their lives so I did continue to go. By now you
can gather that I still didn't have a sense of direction any more. Hell, I didn't to
begin with when I started the whole rehab thing. that's why I went.
<p>
To make a long story short, I told my sponsor I was taking a break from AA, that I 
felt the program was too cult-like for my tastes. I got phone call after phone call
after phone call. and I was lonely. so I met with my sponsor again who convinced me
that I really needed to get my resentments out on paper and confess. so I did. of
course I felt better; that's the purpose of unloading. but I do question why i
thought that I would share these most intimate details with someone who I liked but
i had only known 8 months. it's because she told me 'our stories are so alike.' but
guess what. mine was a different story. I never got arrested, never lost my job,
home, etc. etc. but I knew it was just a matter of time.
<p>
So I'm still in AA and a couple of weeks ago a fellow walked in to the meeting I was
at and asked if this was the AA class. Now, this was the gay/lesbian/transgender
group (I am none of these but the meeting was close to my house) and this fellow was
drunk as a skunk, filthy dirty and higher than a kite. He related how he had just
gotten out of prison after 15 years.  Guess what, another court ordered AA'er.  OK.
in the spirit of 'the program' I smiled and nodded. I noticed him staring at me all
meeting. It creeped me out. And he kept grabbing his side.  You know what was on his
side? A flipping KNIFE on the ready! This guy was making snide remarks to the gay
men and I just felt like 'what the hell am I doing in a room full of people' that
are recounting the horribleness of their lives over and over and over. And now, I've
got a friggin' criminal right next to me that has a weapon.  When the longest hour
I've endured in a long time finally ended, we did the circle and he moved next to me
and when I say gripped my hand, he INTERLACED his fingers in mine and wouldn't let
go as soon as the meeting was over.  I tell you, as a single woman I was scared. I'm
not ugly, I am social and I am compassionate to my fellow sufferer but I have to say
that this went BEYOND a friggin' &quot;12th step&quot;.  I am a believer in God and he gave me
a brain that I'm not using which is telling me &quot;if you believe in God, you don't
need other people to tell you how to believe in God. You don't need groups of angry,
court-ordered, ashamed and vulnerable people surrounding you any more. You are a
strong, viable, kind, loving woman who can be sober on your own. You will find
others like you. Walk with God and not the program.&quot;
<p>
I've felt unsafe in more than one meeting when the court ordered, angry junkies are
there and are talking about bashing heads in, etc etc.
<p>
So I didn't call my sponsor this weekend and her voice mail was slightly accusatory
that &quot;you didn't calll mee this weekend. hmmm. hope you are ok...&quot; It really pissed
me off. I was with my son, enjoying my weekend and yes, I did forget to make my
every other day phone call! and I have NOT been calling to ask her advice on what I 
should do in my life!!!!! If we were truly friends, she would offer advice if I 
asked for it, but not EXPECT me to do HER will according to THE PROGRAMS WILL.
I was given a week off due to Thanksgiving, but I do have some step work to do.
<p>
Screw it.
<p>
I'll be meeting my sponsor and saying ADIOS once and for all. And when I want some
religious doctrine, I'll go to the church of MY choice.
<p>
Thanks for listening to my story.

<p>
Happy Thanksgiving!

Hi Orange,
<p>
I'm glad to hear you are fine and will continue your contribution of
enlightening people re: AA.
<p>
A very disturbing situation I have noticed are
counselors who were drug addicts and spent a lot of time in prison being put in a
position of authority over successful men and women in DUI classes or treatment
centers. I have seen them (counselors) get really abusive and act out a lot of power
plays. Some seem to really enjoy playing one up on these people they never felt
equal to or comfortable around.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again. Wow. Now this is really one slow conversation, isn't it?
<p>
Well, I'm still answering email, again.

<p>
About criminals as counselors: Yes, really. I am reminded of a couple of lines that someone wrote to
me a while back:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
A flawed idea that AA is built upon:  The idea that a deeply flawed person
will cure another deeply flawed person.  A dynamic fraught with peril.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The way that losers can suddenly have power over other people and pass
 themselves off as wise counselors because
they memorized some illogical slogans and allegedly stayed clean and sober for a while
is one of the big attractions of Alcoholics Anonymous and its kin.
How else can an illiteral criminal become a big-shot so easily?
<p>
And they even get to tell themselves that they are unselfishly doing it for the good of others.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Sincere Gratitude<br>

<p>
Sincere Greetings and Gratitude to you AO

<p>
Your work in The Orange Papers is thorough and extensive and so true
...thank you for your dedication and will power.

<p>
I often wonder how many people who have attended AA have died a lonely death
after trying with all their might to 'get it' or, in other words, to
experience that 'happy, joyous and free' thing the very small minority of
'old timers in the group claim to have found in the meetings.

<p>
I am 13 years sober ...what a silly statement to make ....I am thirteen
years older in years .. that's better but it hurts me since I have wasted
four years of my life in those groups. Nevertheless, I have knowledge of the
groups dynamic which I do try to pass on to others' who right now could be
feeling the way I did when the warning lights first started to flash.

<p>
It was a very chilling experience for me when I first started to resent
strongly the old timers in the meetings since my rebellion cut me off from
my friends in the group who sided with the hierarchy. I turned tail about
nine years ago and my last meeting was about two weeks ago !

<p>
I go to meetings perhaps once or twice a month these days depending on
whether I have time to spare.

<p>
Below is my annotated 'share' AO and it hasn't changed much over the last
nine years or so. I delivered it in America too when I was visiting that
country and if there is nothing on the television this evening I might just
consider delivering it at a meeting here in Britain tonight.

<p>
<blockquote>
&quot; Hello, I'm Vince ...I do not suffer from alcoholism in any way shape or
form. I did my fifth step about nine years ago with my doctor at his surgery
in my home town. I made an appointment to see  him and for the first time in
many years I told the honest truth.

<p>
I told him for the last four years I had been involved in a cult and that
that cult is Alcoholics Anonymous. (verbatim) Today I come to meetings to
drink coffee and chat girls up.(This last bit has a few grains of truth in
it, AO, but by and large I only say it to raze the roof.)

<p>
Finally I usually round off with &#8212; 

<p>
&quot;if anybody wants to get me a glass of beer now then I will swill it in my
mouth and swallow about a pint of it, if it will prove of any use. Thank you
for listening.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>
AO the above is all true . By the way I do competition Judo ! I have trawled
the meetings in Britain for the last nine years .... happy, joyous and free
.... and have said the above share hundreds even thousands of time over..

<p>
At the bottom of my heart I would not hurt anyone in the world. But the
'knowledge' being transacted in AA is poison and my vocation in life ... if
I have a vocation at all ... is to at least get the truth out. I think most
of the 'old timers' are just a band of bullies ....but they do have a knack
of getting everybody in the room on their side though. Have had a couple of
little scrapes with the professional bullies in the rooms over the years but
nothing whatsoever serious.

<p>
Your site is vital and great news AO.  I have a degree in philosophy
(Kantian Idealism and Kierkegaard are my areas of research interest) and I
do practise Christianity in the Benedictine Order. Hopefully if I ever find
a girlfriend I can drop this last discipline though and maybe the philosophy
too !!!

<p>
I used to live on the streets ...was a real alcoholic in Manchester for many
years ...took my fair share of Heroin and all the other stuff too. Nearly
died a couple of times in DT's and once when I had pneumonia .... which
still slows me down a bit today when I'm fighting.

<p>
But when I went to AA little did I know I would have to negotiate my way
through a labarynth of deceit and gnosticism. Chilling stuff.

<p>
Your style of writing AO is truthful and humble. It's really nice and
exhudes goodness.That is just what happens when you read truthful stuff.

<p>
If you have time please write. In any event, good luck in life, my brother.

<p>
Yours very truly,

<p>
Vincent E. (Manchester England)

<p>
Hi Agent Orange,

<p>
Gerard Gernazian, here with iamnotagambler.com.<br>
How are you? Happy Thanksgiving.

<p>
I have just posted a new piece on my site, about my take on AA and the steps. I was
thinking that it might be beneficial to your readers as it is coming from the
perspective of why the AA 12 steps didn't work for me, as a Christian. I would like
your readership to know about the steps from different viewpoints, and this would
give a sampling of what a Christian person, like myself, believes about the steps.<br>

From:  	&quot;Grant Hyde&quot;<br>
Subject:  	A.A tyranny<br>

<p>
Hey, Orange

<p>
Thanks for the great work on your site.

<p>
Most of us are ambivalent about Christopher Hitchens
(I'm assuming you've read him)  with his seemingly
blnkered support of the war, but I think we can take a
hint from his analysis of the worst religious impulses
as arising from tyranny and the terrible human need to
be subservient, to be told what's what, even if it's
bad for you.

<p>
I bring Hitchens up, because even if you disagree with
him, he's clear-eyed in an Orwellian way about what
causes otherwise rational people to throw away their
critical faculties and freedom and let the boot stomp
down on their naked faces.  And A. A. does this.
Stomps down on innocent faces pleading for help.

<p>
Hyperbolic?  i think not.  I occasionally attend a
Sunday night &quot;meeting&quot; run (&quot;run&quot; &#8212; are innocents aware
that many A..A. meetings are run, mastered, dictated?)
by a guy younger than me (I'm in my mellow forties)
who has &quot;mastered&quot; the Big Book&quot;.   I suggested one
night &#8212; after I'd had enough &#8212; that &quot;mastering' the Big
Book was like getting a degree in the Reader's Digest.
Hilarity, if not violence, ensued.   I'm sure you
don't need more details.

<p>
I hope to give a coherent thoughtful post someday, but
right now I'm too mad.  I don't know if I've seen a
reference to a secular group   called Life Ring out of
Oakland on your site.   Forgive me if I missed it.  I
know you and I like SMART.   These people are great.

<p>
As a critical thinking instructor &#8212; part time &#8212; at the
local  J.C., I've appreciated immensely the amount of
work you've done in compiling fallacies.  I've stolen
from you.  Forvgive?
<p>
Take care,<br>

Hi Grant,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the thanks. Yes, borrowing and reusing is okay. I do a lot of it myself.

Have a good day.

From:  	&quot;Brad L&quot; <br>
Subject:  	your AA info<br>

<p>
Hi

<p>
I read many of your pages with great interest (I googled &quot;aa religion&quot;
after a local politician was sentenced today to 2 AA meetings per week &#8212; 
among other penalties)

<p>
I have had a similar experience with a DUI and was able to convince the
judge (in chambers) that AA directly conflicted with my religion.
Consequently, my minister had to attend my probation meetings to attest
that I was actively involved in the church. Where IS separation of church
and state? (I live in Ohio).

<p>
I had voluntarily attended AA many years ago, and it was a joke. The only
thing that kept me sober was a psychiatrist who had me so doped up on
prescriptions that I had no interest in booze... the pills numbed me just
fine &#8212; I was basically a walking zombie.... and THAT is legal... go figure.
When I fired him after a year, I went back to the drink.

<p>
Now sober for quite some time, I have to give credit to a website that
basically told me my alcoholic addiction is not a disease, but purely will
power to quit. (They have an expensive program you can attend in
California, but I got all I needed from their website
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322003519/http://www.rational.org/">
http://www.rational.org/</a>.
<p>
I've recommended that site to many who have also
had successful results... perhaps you should mention it? Its not stuff a
drunk really wants to hear, but when you read it it rings so true

<p>
On a more humorous note... did you know Bill W was inspired in writing the
12 steps with the aid of a Ouija board!!! see:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322003519/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija</a>

That alone confirms AA is a farce.

<p>
Best regards,

<p>
Brad

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Brad,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Funny that you should mention Rational Recovery. That subject has been coming up a lot lately.
I also basically quit by understanding &quot;the Addiction Monster&quot;, which Jack Trimpey calls &quot;The Beast&quot;.
I coincidentally stumbled across the same idea, mostly from 30 years of smoking and trying to quit and failing because
some stupid little voice kept yammering about,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Just one, we can have just one to relax and it will be okay.&quot;
</font>
<p>
I just wrote up a description of that,
<a href="orange-letters108.html#avrt">here</a>.
<p>
To be nit-pickingly historically accurate, I have never seen any information
that indicates that Bill Wilson wrote the 12 Steps while using a Ouija board.
Bill Wilson said that
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#Bill_guided">he got &quot;inspiration&quot; during a &quot;Quiet Time&quot;</a>,
but there was no mention of the Ouija board there.  However,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Ouija">it is well documented</a>
that both Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob used a Ouija board in their &quot;spook sessions&quot;.
They were intensely into the spiritualism stuff.
Tom Powers, who was the co-author of <i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
also participated in Bill Wilson's spook sessions at Bill's Bedford Hills home and wrote about them.
<p>
And Bill Wilson was also into various other occult practices like channeling, spirit rapping, 
automatic writing, and necromancy.
There is a section on this subject in the file 
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>.

<p>
What Bill really did to get the 12 Steps was just repackage Frank Buchman's cult recruiting and indoctrination
practices like the &quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#five_C">Five C's</a>&quot;
and the &quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#six_practices">Six Practices of the Sane</a>&quot;.
<p>
Have a good day.
