Subject:  	AA reconfirms that the 12 Steps are the Oxford Group Steps<br>

<p>
Hi again Terrance,
<p>
I know that you've already covered this before and have clearly shown that
AA's 12 steps are derived from the Oxford Group steps but I thought that
you'd appreciate what I found below:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The founding members had been using six steps borrowed from the Oxford
Groups, where many of them started out. Bill felt that more specific
instructions would be better, and in the course of writing A.A.'s basic
text, Alcoholics Anonymous, he expanded them to twelve.&quot;<br>

</blockquote>


<p>
AA's 12 steps are not, as we are led to believe, the distillation of years
of experimentation and trial and error which resulted in 12 unique and
effective behaviors designed to aid the alcoholic in achieving and
maintaining sobriety. No, the 12 steps are just an expansion of the Oxford
Group's 6 steps.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Iamnotastatistic,
<p>
Yes, thanks for the input. A.A. true believers and &quot;A.A. History Lovers&quot; often try to
gloss over the Oxford Group roots of the 12 Steps. I can't count how many have written
to me and told me that,
<ol type="A">
<li> Bill Wilson got the 12 Steps from God.
<li> Bill Wilson discovered the 12 Steps from working with alcoholics, and found that they are
the only thing that works to get alcoholics sober.
</ol>

<p>
But even the official council-approved A.A. history books like Lois Wilson's book say:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
By this time Bill was ready to start the fifth chapter,
&quot;How It Works.&quot; He was not feeling well, but
the writing
had to go on, so he took pad and pencil to bed with
him. How could he bring the program alive so that
those at a distance, reading the book, could apply it to
themselves and perhaps get well? He had to be very
explicit. The six Oxford Group principles that the
Fellowship had been using were not definite enough.
He must broaden and deepen their implications. He
relaxed and <a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">asked for guidance</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When he finished writing and reread what he had
put down, he was quite pleased. Twelve principles had
developed &#8212; the Twelve Steps.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Lois Remembers</i>, Lois Wilson, Page 113<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course the 12 Steps are not &quot;principles&quot;, they are practices.

<p>
And Bill Wilson himself explained that he had to make the Oxford Group six
&quot;steps&quot; &#8212; really, the &quot;Six Practices of the Sane&quot;
&#8212; into 12 steps because alcoholics were so dishonest and would
&quot;wiggle out of&quot; their contracts:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this
book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a
six-step program then.<br>
...<br>
The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of
concrete principles
that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out
of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps
which people wiggled out of.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson also declared,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got its ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.

<p><br>

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>The Language of the Heart</i>, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's quite a stretch to try to twist all of that into a statement that Bill Wilson got the
12 Steps from God or from his experience with alcoholics.

Subject:  	God in AA literature and AA meetings<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,
<p>
Sorry for the barrage of emails but I have some spare time and a lot of
information to share so I hope you don't mind.

<p>
I did a quick word search of AA literature and found that in the first 164
pages of the &quot;Big Book&quot;:
<ul>
<li>
God (capital G) is mentioned 136 times. (There are parts in the Bible as
long as the Big Book that don't mention God as often.)
<li>
References to God such as He/His/Him/Himself/Creator/Father/etc. are made
85 times.
<li>
In reference to AA's &quot;solution&quot; for alcoholism the words
Miracle/Miracles/Miraculous are mentioned 15 times.
</ul>

<p>
In the book Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions the first 125 pages,
relating to the 12 steps:
<ul>
<li>
God (capital G) is mentioned 140 times.
<li>
References to God such as He/His/Him/Himself/Creator/Father/etc. are
mentioned 42 times.
<li>
In reference to AA's &quot;solution&quot; for alcoholism the words
Miracle/Miracles/Miraculous are mentioned 2 times.
</ul>

<p>
And yet they insist that it's not religious!

<p>
I remember being in an AA meeting once where the chairperson was pounding
his fist on the table and loudly insisting that AA was spiritual and NOT
religious. A few minutes later he lead the group, with hands held and heads
bowed, in the Lord's Prayer. I could barely keep myself from laughing.
What I also noticed from my time in AA was that leaders or chairpersons
often prefaced the Lord's Prayer with the phrase &quot;Who keeps us sober?&quot;
...... then the members would respond with &quot;Our Father who art in
Heaven...&quot;. This implied to me that whatever belief a member held or
whatever Higher Power they believed in was immaterial because it was God
who was keeping AA members sober.

<p>
I also remember a time when I was leading a small AA meeting (~10 people)
when there was a Sikh guy and a Muslim guy present (both court ordered). As
we stood to recite the Lord's Prayer, I suggested (in deference to those
who were obviously from a different religion), that we would have a minutes
silence so that everyone could say their own prayer. An oldtimer took a
grave and very vocal offense to this deviation and loudly began to recite
the Lord's Prayer. To my amazement everyone else (except the Sikh and the
Muslim guys and me) joined in. Intolerance and conformity ruled!
I was so ashamed of and disgusted with AA that day &#8212; I'll never forget it.

Wow. Thanks for the story. Yes, A.A. really does a big flip-flop on whether they are
religious or spiritual.
<p>
And that &quot;flip-flop&quot; is also a few bait-and-switch tricks:

<ul>
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_purpose" target="_blank">First, it's only a &quot;spiritual&quot;

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#keep_your_religion" target="_blank">First, you can keep your own religion,
and then you can't.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#re_education" target="_blank">First, it's <i>&quot;any God as you
understand Him&quot;</i>, and then it's <i>&quot;You don't understand
God. You are 'confused' and 'prejudiced'.&quot;</i></a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#power_greater" target="_blank">First, a loosely-defined &quot;Higher Power&quot;,
and then an explicitly-defined &quot;God&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#kind_of_God" target="_blank">Redefine God. First you get one God,

From:  	&quot;Paul K.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	relapse<br>

<p>
Hi, again, Orange, it is Paul here again (from Australia), I have
written to you before.

<p>
I am an alcoholic (and I also have been told by doctors I have bipolar
disorder) and after almost 18 months sobriety I lapsed ( or relapsed?)
back into alcohol abuse in mid January.

<p>
After one absolutely terrible 3 day alcoholic spree in late January I
was feeling very sick and very desperate and I rang the AA phone
number in Sydney. The AA person I spoke to was sane and reasonable. We
had a bit in common with experience of NSW Australian jails and
prisons. This AA person on the phone also told me to NEVER listen to
anyone in AA or NA who told me to stop taking bipolar meds. I suppose
he said that because there are still at least a minority of AA people
who can advise &quot;dual diagnosis&quot; people to stop their meds.

<p>
So, despite of what I have expressed in previous letters to you, in
desperation, I got back into AA. To be honest over the past month I
have found much, but not all, that is said in the AA meetings itself
boring and not very useful. The part of AA I like is the &quot;meeting
after the meeting&quot;, where I can drink coffee and have a normal
conversation with those at the meeting I both like and I feel are on
something like the same &quot;wave length&quot; as me.

<p>
A sponsor was recommended (sp?) to me. This AA man has 27 years
sobriety. Some of his advice is really good. For example, drink lots
of water and less coffee, try to walk each day for exercise and eat
well, write down things to be grateful for so as to fight self pity
and resentments and maybe look at quitting smoking in a year or so; I
even followed his advice in forcing myself to pray for people I
believe have harmed me in my life (I have a long list of such people);
I just forced myself to do this and I have felt some peace afterwards.
BUT there are problems I am having with this sponsor. I feel I don't
want and need to make AA my whole life and get to meetings EVERY day.
I have in the past obtained 10, 22 and 18 months sobriety with little
or no AA. Also, I have been in a great relationship with a wonderful
woman for almost 2 years; and Melanie has 3 kids from her first
marriage; and for this and other reasons I have obligations and things
to do in my life that makes getting to a meeting every day not
possible. Yet my sponsor wants me to have AA meetings as the number
one thing in my life.

<p>
My relationship with Mel is the most important thing in my life. I
know I could ruin this relationship if I do not again stay sober for
at least a long time; or even forever.

<p>
Maybe I just dont have enough faith in AA; maybe I just don't believe
a meeting a day is 100% necessary for me to stay sober?

<p>
Mel has now read parts of your Orange Papers. She agrees with a lot of
it. Obviously she does not want to live with a drunk. But she feels
there are people in AA who truly do not understand the problems
bipolar people have. Also, she belives what a doctor once said which
was words to the effect that if my bipolar illness is properly managed
then it sort of just follows that the alcohol abuse problem, to a
large extent, is solved too.

<p>
I am 50 now. 10 years ago I was on remand in maximum security prison
for robbing a liquor store while manic and drunk. I saw 2 forensic
psychiatrists in prison who wrote reports for court and both said the
same; I suffer from a bipolar disorder but I am also an alcoholic.
Because both shrinks said I was bipolar but did not have an antisocial
personality disorder I got a lenient sentence and was fairly soon out
of jail; but I had to do 10 months in rehab and a month in a psych
ward before full release into the community.

<p>
Thanks again for reading my letters and replying.

<p>
BTW- I think AA in Australia must be more laid back than the USA. It
is not unusual in AA or NA here to hear someone say things like he/she
has never read the Big Book etc and it was certain AA people and not
the AA program that got them sober.

<p>
Paul.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties that you have been
going through, but glad to hear that things are getting better.
<p>
You clearly understand the situation: Your real problem is the Bipolar Disorder.
Your excessive drinking is caused by the Bipolar Disorder.
I have a friend here who has the same problem.
He regularly cycles every three years. That is, for like 18 months he seems to be normal,
and then he goes off the rails for 18 months until he ends up arrested and losing his car
from drunk driving, and things like that.
<p>
Of course medications are essential for controlling Bipolar Disorder. The fools who tell people
not to take their medications are playing doctor with someone else's life when they have no
medical training at all. They are not qualified doctors, and they are not licensed to
practice medicine, but they feel entitled to countermand the orders of a real doctor
and mess with someone's recovery.

<p>
A survey that was done here in the USA found that only 17% of the sponsors told their sponsees
not to take their medications. But 34% of the newcomers got told not to take their medications.
Obviously, those know-it-all anti-medications sponsors were trying to
give instructions to more than one newcomer.
<p>

</font>

<p>
I agree about the advice to get more fresh air and exercise. I make a point of getting out
and riding my bicycle around. Just yesterday, the rain let up and I got out to the Fernhill
Wetlands and fed my feathered friends, and found that
<a href="orange-letters344.html#goslings3" target="_blank">Gus' wife had returned from her winter quarters</a>.
<p>
And the mental exercises, like counting your blessings, are good. Think positively and
the world looks better. And thinking good thoughts about people whom you have reason to
hate is good, and will calm your mind.

<p>
Having a social circle is very good, and important, but I can't help but think that there must
be some better social circle than people who believe in a cult religion and
mistakenly repeat its superstitions as unquestionable wisdom. That presents big problems,
like your sponsor insisting that A.A. must be the most important thing in your life.
I don't know if there are any branches of SMART or SOS in Australia. I hope
so. Here is the contact list:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a><br>
Perhaps you can learn from their web sites, or by asking on their forums or chat lines,
whether they have any meetings where you are.

<p>
You are right when you think that the sponsor is over-doing it &#8212; way over-doing it. You don't
need to devote your whole life to A.A., or go every day,
 and A.A. does not have to be the most important
thing in your life. That is crazy. That is cult talk.
That is a common cult characteristic:
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_own_you" target="_blank">The cult wants to own you</a>.
<p>
I would dump that sponsor. I don't care how many years of supposed sobriety or cult membership he has.
He isn't doing you any good.
I don't even see why you need a sponsor. What you need are
medications and a good doctor.
And maybe a counselor to tell you not to drink so much coffee, and to get fresh air
and exercise, and to think better thoughts.

<p>
And if you wish to continue associating with A.A. for the meeting after the meeting, okay,
but please be aware of the fact that half of the &quot;wisdom&quot; that they parrot is nonsense.
Take everything with a grain of salt.

<p>
The teachings from your sponsor show a big problem with A.A., something that I call
&quot;The Partially True Rule&quot;. All of the stuff that they tell you is only partially true.
Like getting more fresh air and exercise, and getting less jacked up on caffeine,
and thinking good thoughts is good advice. But devoting your life to A.A.,
and going to meetings every day, and making A.A. more important than your wife,
is very bad advice. And that is just so common with A.A.: For every good thing
you learn, you learn a couple of bad, harmful, untrue things. 
And you have the problem of figuring out which is which. And sometimes the bad advice
can lead to
<a href="orange-letters344.html#bad_advice" target="_blank">disastrous results</a>
before you learn which slogan or pious teaching is true and which is false.
People regularly die from bad A.A. advice.

<p>
And yes, your wife is worth more than A.A. Really, no joke. The Harvard Medical School
said that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<font size="+2">
<b>On their own</b>
</font>
<br>
There is a high rate of recovery among alcoholics and addicts,
treated and untreated. According to one estimate, heroin addicts
break the habit in an average of 11 years.
Another estimate is that at least 50% of alcoholics eventually free
themselves although only 10% are ever treated.
One recent study found that 80% of all alcoholics who recover
for a year or more do so on their own, some after being unsuccessfully
treated. When a group of these self-treated alcoholics was
interviewed, 57% said they simply decided that alcohol was bad
for them. Twenty-nine percent said health problems,
frightening experiences,
accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.
Others used such phrases as &quot;Things were building up&quot;
or &quot;I was sick and tired of it.&quot; Support from a husband
or wife was important in sustaining the resolution.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Support from a husband or wife was important in sustaining the resolution.</b><br> 
Yes, your wife is more important than your sponsor, or A.A.<br>
Successful people usually do it without A.A., but it's much harder without a good spouse.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

From:  	&quot;David A.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Interesting stuff A. Orange<br>

<p>
My name is David A and I was released  just 10 days ago after spending 30 days in an
alcohol rehab facility called Campobello in California. I came across your site
after searching for a new community to begin my journey of abstinence, I read a lot
of the material and came to the conclusion that I lean toward the ideas which are
stated in the Orange Paper's site.

<p>
I cast a shadow into the rooms of AA 4 years ago knowing I needed to find some way
of quitting drinking. I found a sponsor, a wonderful 70 year old man with 18 years
sobriety that showed me the steps and after the steps we worked the 12 by 12 for
about a year. There was one thing that I didn't do, I did not quit drinking. AA
worked for me only about 3 months and then I drank again hiding it from everyone, at
least that is what I thought. In retrospect I can see that AA allowed me to twist
and flip all of their suggestions to justify my drinking. My fellowship empowered me
to be hopeless and powerless which enabled me to relapse. I know that no body put a
gun to my head and made me drink, that was my decision, but in the back of my mind I
knew that there was something not entirely right about AA for me. In those 4 years
my drinking got progressively worse and the meetings became non-existent in my life
as did my relationship with my sponsor.

<p>
My dilemma between drinking and sobriety got so bad that I became hopeless. AA
seemed to be the only alternative and I knew it would not work for me. I thought I
was one of the Constitutionally Incapable of recovery. Admitting my self into
Campobello's care sparked an interest in me that there may be a different path to
sobriety instead of AA and it was as simple as not picking up that first drink, no
matter what. Along with not drinking came the notion that I had really made a mess
of my brain and that my frontal cortex was not working correctly as my mid brain
kept it from doing so. I am a laymen about physiology and brain functions, but my
case managers put it  into a context that I could grasp. It was made clear to me
that I have to be sober for at least six months before I can get back 65% of my
frontal cortex which is where my good decisions are going to be made. If I can make
it 9 months I have a 85% chance of staying sober for 5 plus years. So
far, so good.

<p>
Nearly everything said in &quot;The 12 Biggest Secrets of AA&quot; at your site rings true to
me. This is what enlightened me to dig deeper into your writings and into my own
needs for sobriety. It seems there is an agenda that the Orange Papers have against
Bill Wilson and that is OK as any one doing research has to have a hypothesis which
will either be proven or disproven when the work is peer reviewed. Like the Green
Paper's web page, proponents of AA bring up this point but it seems that their
argument does not stand a chance against your in depth analysis of Bill W. and AA.
In treatment I asked the lecturer whether he fealt that AA is in the proccess of
becomong out dated and he virtually agreed that it is. Perhaps one could say that AA
is in need of reformation and not reaffermation.

<p>
In your papers it is said that when a person decides to stop drinking only then will
they decide to stop for good. It just happens to be where they are at that moment
does that place or thing get credit. If a person is in a fellowship of AA at the
time of abstinence then AA gets credit for the sobriety. I tend to beleive this and
am going to base my recovery on this notion. Campobello gets credit with giving me a
start in the right direction, but I am going to give my self credit for the time I
have in sobriety. Again, so far, so good.

<p>
I want to give all the relapsers in AA a chance to see the Orange Paper web site and
perhaps empower them to see that they may be barking up the wrong sobriety tree.
There are so many inconsistancies in the Big Book of AA which the Orange Papers
bring to light it seems obvious that the book was written not by a professional in
the medical field but by a failed business man searching for his own way to stay
sober. Bill W. found his way to stay sober and it worked for others for a while. It
seems it had become a business venture guised by a spiritual awakening and the road
to revovery was either the AA way or the highway.

<p>
Like me, alcoholics may be using AA as an excuse to continue their drinking because
they feel that there are no other avenues for them to explore in keeping their side
of the street clean.

Hello David,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the many compliments. Yes, I try hard to tell the truth
and make sure what I'm saying is true. People's lives are on the line.

<p>
You make several points I'd like to comment on:

<p>
<ol>
<p><li> First off, let me thank you and congratulate you for all of your efforts and work
to quit drinking and get your life together. Even the things that didn't work still matter.
You know the Beatles song, &quot;With every mistake we still must be learning...
While my guitar gently weeps...&quot;


<p>
<a name="prosopagnosia"> </a>
<li>
Speaking of your pre-frontal cortex:
Oh yes, that is true. Alcohol, and especially alcohol combined with malnutrition and
thiamine deficiency, is just death on brain cells. When the thiamine deficiency gets
to be too bad, the brain cells die by the millions.
<p>
When I quit drinking, my brain was
so messed up that I could not remember people's faces. (The long name for that is Prosopagnosia.)
I talked to some guy in the morning for half an hour, sharing coffee and cigarettes
and trading life stories, and then in the evening I couldn't remember ever having seen
him before in my life. He recognized me, and explained how we had talked together in the morning.
Then I just remembered the first fragment of it, getting the cup of coffee.
I could vaguely remember the start of the
conversation, agreeing to share the coffee and cigarettes,
and then it was like someone flicked a light switch, and all of the
memories of the rest of the day were gone.
 That was actually the moment when I was shocked to learn that
I had a serious problem.
<p>
Likewise, I talked to a pretty girl in an office and she said
she would fill out some papers for me, so come back in an hour, and an hour later I
couldn't remember who the pretty girl that I talked to was. I looked at all of the
girls in the office and couldn't begin to figure out which one I had talked to.
Fortunately, she saw me and remembered me, and came over with the paperwork.

<p>
That kind of stuff happened a lot. It got to be like the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
<i>Total Recall</i> where people were erasing his memories. After a while, it gets wierd to
walk through a homeless people's place and lots of people are saying, &quot;Hi Terry,&quot; and I
didn't have a clue who they were. I couldn't remember having ever having seen them before.
Lots of people knew me but I didn't know any of them.
<p>
I developed the skill of not letting on that I didn't remember. &quot;Hi, good to see you again.&quot;
Never say how long it's been since I've seen him, because I don't have a clue.
Never ask what his name is because it might be the dozenth time that I've asked.
<p>
Yes, it got really bad. I am very lucky that I didn't lose my mind. I almost did.
The condition is
called <i>Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome</i>, and it is incurable. Once the brain cells die, they 
are dead and it's over. Me, I was right at the edge of the cliff, with my toes over the
edge, and if I had taken one more step, that is, drank any longer, then I would have
gone over the cliff and that would have been the end of my short-term memory.
Fortunately, I quit just in time.
Still, it took five years to get most of my short-term memory back. <b><i>Most of. Not all.</i></b>
I will never get all of it back, I'm still not very good at faces any more (and I used to be
great at faces), but things are still so much better now that my
brain has been healing for a dozen years.

<p>
For more about the workings of the brain, and the lower centers arguing with the pre-frontal
corex, please see that web page about
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">The Lizard-Brain Addiction Monster</a>.
The knowledge on that page was a real life-saver to me in the first year of sobriety.


<p><li>
I also went through the hopeless phase. I got all depressed and thought, &quot;There is no
sense in wasting your time trying to quit alcohol and tobacco, even though they
are killing you. You will just relapse
again, just like before. You always backslid every time before.
Might as well just stay stoned and kill the pain until the
bitter end.&quot; The A.A. teachings about being powerless and the situation being
hopeless did not help at all.
<p>
The amazing thing is that, at the last minute, when I was staring into my own grave, and
the end was near,
I just snapped and decided that I was not going to die that way. I can't entirely explain
it, but that's what happened.
I just changed my mind, and then changed my life.
<p>
Now A.A. says that you can't do that. But I am living proof that you can.

<p><li>  About &quot;an agenda that the Orange Papers have against
Bill Wilson&quot;, yes, I have a lot of contempt for that man. There is a reason for that:
He pretended to be some kind of holy man who had a new cure from God, but he was really just
a lying fraud who stole all of the money, women, drugs, and fame.
<p>
It's one thing to be a fake holy man and deceive gullible people in the name of God.
Most cult leaders do that.
That is a very despicable crime that makes it harder for people to make spiritual progress.
Mahatma Gandhi said that there is no greater crime than to oppress men in the name of God.
And an Indian judge said that there is no greater crime than to deceive men in the name of God.
<p>
But Bill Wilson found something even lower: Add on deceiving sick people and
selling them a quack cure that he knew didn't work. That killed people, and it's
still killing people. That is really the lowest of the low. And that's why I have
a lot of contempt for him.
<p>
It boggles my mind just trying to imagine what he was thinking when he did that.
Did he even lie to himself and say, &quot;It's for their own good.&quot;?
Or did he say, &quot;They are just digusting alcoholics and they deserve to get ripped off.&quot;?

<p>
I have to go to great lengths to show just what he was because there are so many A.A. true
believers who are working hard to make Bill Wilson into some kind of a saint.
(See
<a href="orange-letters167.html#Hallmark2" target="_blank">the Hallmark made-for-TV movie <i>My name is Bill W.</i></a>
for an example of that.)
They sit around reading <i>As Bill Sees It</i> and quoting him and raving about
how wonderful it is that he could invent 12 such perfect steps that will solve
all of the problems of the world. No joke. I got that at an A.A. meeting.



<p><li>
Now, about finding a more sane and realistic group of sober people to hang out with:
May I suggest SMART and SOS? Here is the list of addresses:<br>
<a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a>

<p><li>
And I have to mention the lists of discussions about how we got sober:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

</ol>
<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

From:  	&quot;Aldis J.&quot;<br>
Subject:<br>

<p>
I have read from your site a number of times and am still at a bit of a loss about
what basis you use for the claim that AA's success rate is only 5%. The various
studies show the success rate of AA-based treatment, which is not strictly speaking
AA. The triennial survey graph has a few things wrong with it:   First of all, it's
meant to show the distribution of sobriety over the first year.  Five percent of
those in their first year (except the ones who left before being counted)  are in
their 12th month, but if you assumed a 100% retention rate and a steady rate of
newcomers, there would only be 100/12 months = 8.3%.  The data as presented seem to
show a 26% rate because 19% falls to 5%.  There's no real telling how many people
dabble by going to a meeting or two, giving them a 1 or 2 in 365 chance of being
counted.    However, even if it did factor out to 5%, you're comparing them with ALL
the other alcoholics...those who haven't decided to quit and those who have...which
would actually mean AA had a higher standard to meet than 5% until we have a way to
cherry pick the serious natural remitters out of the general alcoholic population.
That is why measures of coerced attendance may be pertinent I suppose...you include
everybody, not just the ones who have made a serious decision to quit. The last
problem of course is that the triennial surveys are AA's own data rather than an
unbiased study. So how can you say their success matches natural remission?  We
don't really have any hard numbers for the dabblers who would have fallen outside
the triennial survey.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Aldis,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the questions.
<p>
Alas, you are confusing the A.A. retention rate with
the A.A. success rate. They are two very different numbers. The only relationship that the
two numbers have is the fact that the A.A. success rate cannot be higher than the A.A.
retention rate.<br>
(And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Dr. Vaillant showed that the real A.A. success rate was zero</a>.
Eight years of A.A. &quot;treatment&quot;
produced no improvement over a group of other alcoholics who got no treatment. But A.A. produced
the highest death rate of any treatment modality that Dr. Vaillant studied.)

<p>
The famous graph in <i>Comments on A.A.'s Triennial Surveys</i> &quot;5M/12-90/TC&quot;
did not show the answer to any questions about months of sobriety.
The survey only asked the newcomers with a year or less of attendance how many months 
they had been going to A.A. meetings.
It didn't ask how long they had been sober.
They might have all been drunk all of the time and it wouldn't change the graph.

<p>
Your other points are quite true, and right on:
<p>
<ul>

<li> If A.A. had a 100% retention rate, that would produce
a steady-state pipeline where 8.5% of the members would be in each month of attendance. Each month,
a certain number of newcomers would enter the pipeline, while an equal number 
would &quot;graduate&quot; from
the other end of the pipeline. But that is obviously not the case. 
The steeply-declining exponential curve that the
graph shows is undeniable evidence of a large dropout rate.

<p>
<li> You just hinted at the problem of people
who came to a few meetings, or even months of meetings,
and were so put off by what they saw and heard that they didn't come
back any more.
Those people didn't get counted in the survey, so there are a lot of dropouts
who quit A.A. just before the Triennial Surveys were done. Hence, the surveys
are grossly inaccurate, and do not show the real retention rate, or rather, lack of retention.
<p>
Because there are 1096 days in three years (including one leap year),
<ul>
<li> the odds of a one-time visitor getting counted
in a Triennial Survey are less than one in a thousand.<br>
<li> Likewise, the odds of a two-timer getting counted in the survey are less than one in 500.<br>
<li> And a three-timer has odds of one in 365. And so on.<br>
<li> Even someone who attends meetings for three months before dropping out (like I did)
has only a one in twelve chance of getting counted in a Triennial Survey. (And I didn't get counted.)<br>
<li> Even people who came to A.A. meetings for a whole year and then quit A.A. only
had a one in three chance of getting counted in the surveys.
</ul>
So there are an immense number of dropouts who didn't get counted in the survey.
<p>
We were just talking about that issue a few letters back, here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters344.html#iamnotastatistic" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters344.html#iamnotastatistic</a>
<p>
Also notice what that will do to any questions on the Triennial Surveys
about long-term sobriety. All of the 
failures and dropouts will be missing, which will make A.A. look like it must be keeping
people sober for years.
But it's just an optical illusion caused by only seeing part of the picture.


<p><li>
About the unbiased study: Oh yes. The author of those mathematical analyses that
are discussed in the previous letter complained
that the A.A. headquarters will not even release the raw data from the surveys so
that we can do our own analysis.  They are hiding a lot of information.
<p>
Both papers are here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="The_Mathematics_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous_-_Part_1.pdf">
The_Mathematics_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous_-_Part_1.pdf</a> &#8212; Analysis of the mathematics of Alcoholics Anonymous, using A.A.'s own published documents

<li> <a href="The_Mathematics_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous_-_Part_2.pdf">
The_Mathematics_of_Alcoholics_Anonymous_-_Part_2.pdf</a> &#8212; Analysis of the mathematics of Alcoholics Anonymous, using A.A.'s own published documents
</ul>

<p>
And we have no reason to believe any numbers from the A.A. headquarters when they lie
on their own web site and claim that the average sobriety time of A.A. members is 8 years.
That is physically impossible, because it would require that a 16-year oldtimer exist for
each and every newcomer so that the average of the two of them together is 8 years.
But anybody who has even been to a few A.A. meetings and looked around and talked with
people and watched people picking up their 30-day or 90-day coins knows that newcomers and
people with just two or three years of sobriety predominate, and people with 10 or more years are
rare as hen's teeth. More on that here:<br>
<a href="orange-letters330.html#iamnotastatistic" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters330.html#iamnotastatistic</a>

<p>
<li> Also, as you mentioned, only surveying people who come to A.A. meetings also biases the numbers
in another way. Most of those people actually wish to quit drinking, or are seriously thinking
about it. The only exceptions are the coerced people who got sentenced to A.A. by a judge
or parole officer or &quot;Employee Diversion Program&quot;.
So of course any &quot;treatment program&quot; will appear to have an elevated success rate when you
only &quot;treat&quot; people who are sincerely trying to quit and improve their lives.
But again, A.A. is just stealing the credit for other people's hard work.
The results will be far less successful if they try their methods on all alcoholics in general,
including those who don't want to quit.

</ul>

<p>
Have a good day now.

This was a big breakthrough. This is the first time these families felt comfortable with
sleeping in front of me. These families are totally wild geese, mind you, and they
migrate and everything, and they started off being very nervous
about me finding them and their babies out back. But I gradually gained their trust by feeding
them and not hurting them, day after day. This day, after I put out rolled oats for
them to eat, I just sat down and rested. They came over, and ate the oats,
and then they sat down in front of me and took a nap. Now that is really trusting.
We spent a pleasant half hour together just resting, and then they wandered off.

I can see the attraction of the trainwrecks on Celebrity Rehab.
<p>
One reason I'm glad to have left the rooms is the slogan,&quot;We will gladly
refund your misery.&quot; This is very true. What better fodder for sharing than
someone you've seen in the rooms, fail miserably? There's nothing like the abundant,
skillfully crafted, cryptically coded, well rehearsed slogan-laced message of
hope/doom with scandalous knowing glances and nods to brighten my day.
<p>
Gladly refund my misery? What an enlightened, caring, God-conscious thing to say to someone.

Subject:  	what's your point<br>

<p>
even if only 1 person is changed from a self-destructive train wreck to a 're-born'
person i say thank you for the help.
<p>
what's wrong about that.

Hello Dan,
<p>
Thanks for the question. And the answer is: What's wrong about that is that A.A. kills
more people than it saves. A.A. is such bad therapy that it:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raises the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">raises the rate of rearrests</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">raises the cost of hospitalization</a>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">raises the death rate</a>
</ul>

<p>
When
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>,
who just loves A.A., and who went on to become a member of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous,
tested A.A. and tried to prove that A.A. works, what he accidentally proved is that A.A. kills.
The score he got with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients was: 5 continuously sober, 29 dead,
and 66 still drinking. No way of treating alcohol abuse that Vaillant studied
 produced a higher death rate.

<p>
So you tell me, is it okay to kill 6 people in order to save 1?
Do you think it's still worth it?
<p>
Then, of course, we have to consider the normal rate of spontaneous remission in
alcoholics.
About 5% per year will just quit drinking all on their own, without any treatment
or &quot;help&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;. When you subtract that 5% from
the apparent 5% success rate that A.A. got, the result is a zero-percent A.A. success rate. A.A.
did not make any alcoholics actually quit drinking.
The only alcoholics who quit drinking are the ones who were going to quit drinking anyway.
And Dr. Vaillant said so.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	please help!<br>

<p>
Hi there,

<p>
I have luckily discovered your web page while I was desperately searching
for some help. A closest friend of mine has a problem with alcohol but she
managed to stay sober for years without AA, on her own.
<p>
Then she had drinks on a few occasions which ended up pretty badly and
someone suggested that she should try to attend AA meeting and
unfortunately she did so, this was over a year ago. They made her believe
that she's an alcoholic and she started attending these meetings regularly
and working on the 12 step program, since that day &#8212; that's is all she
does.  If she's not at a group meeting &#8212; she's in a cafe with a group or on
the phone with other alcoholics, sponsors, newcomers and this is a vicious
never-ending circle I wish to drag her out of it so badly. They made her
believe that she will never recover, she will always stay an alcoholic no
matter how long she stays sober and this 'recovery' process is for life and
is endless. She would never consider quitting this sect or doubt their
beliefs.
<p>
I have no idea on how to approach her, I tried to talk about this a few
times, the conversations did not go well.  She's like a different person and
I want her back. I got scared of what they've done to her and I cannot sit
and watch them taking her and mine lives away like that.

<p>
Do you perhaps have any guidance/advice or a program for friends and
families of those in AA? There must be a way out of this.

<p>
I really hope to hear from you.

<p>
Thank you.

<p>
Julia

Hello Julia,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm sorry to hear about what you and your friend are going
through. What you described is just classic &#8212; the standard way that cults suck people in.
They want to monopolize all of the new recruit's time with constant meetings and get-togethers
and activities and recruiting, and &quot;book study&quot; &#8212; studying the
Bible or the A.A. <i>Big Book</i> or whatever, it doesn't matter. The cult always
has some book for recruits to study.
And the new recruits become obsessed with the organization.

<p>
And of course the new recruit must believe everything that they tell her, or else.
They use phobia induction to make the new recruit afraid that she will die or worse if
she leaves the cult, or fails to perform properly.

<p>
And your friend has become a true believer and reacts strongly when you criticize A.A.
That is just standard cult behavior.  They cannot discuss the issues rationally.

<p>
And the kicker is that your friend doesn't even sound like an alcoholic. Getting drunk and
obnoxious a couple of times does not make someone an alcoholic. (It makes her human.)
It might be evidence that she probably should not drink alcohol,
but that isn't evidence of alcoholism. Not yet.

<p>
What comes to mind is Steve Hassan's books about freeing a loved one from a cult. He teaches
a bunch of handy techniques for getting people out:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Hassan" target="_blank"><i>Combatting Cult Mind Control</i></a>
<li>
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank">
<i>Releasing the Bonds; Empowering People To Think For Themselves</i></a>
</ul>
<p>
We previously discussed the same issues in these letters, so I'll point you to the discussions
and answers there:
