Thanks for the tip. I'll have to check out that debate. New to A.A., huh? What is it they say about
converts? &quot;There is no Catholic like a recent convert.&quot;
Meaning, that the recent converts are trying very hard to convince themselves and others about
the correctness of their convictions.

Hi,

<p>
I don't have a copy of the Brandsma study.
Can you clarify something for me?

<p>
Subjects were tested at 3, 5, 9 and 12 months. Extra bingeing was seen in
AAs only at 6. How did this affect the overall binge rate, over the 12
month periond?

<p>

Hello again, Hetu-Ahin,
<p>
I don't have Dr. Brandsma's book handy, so I can't verify what you are saying. What I xeroxed and quoted
was that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma saw an over-all increase in binge drinking
in A.A. members</a>,
including after &quot;treatment&quot; ended.
He didn't say that they stopped binge drinking after that, or that they were not binge drinking before that.
He also noted that the A.A. group got arrested more than the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy groups,
during treatment.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Three months after terminating treatment the only variables that
revealed differences concerned drinking behavior. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
<font color="#8F0000">
In this analysis AA was five times more likely to binge than the control
and nine times more likely than the lay-RBT.
</font>
The AA group average was 2.4
binges in the last 3 months since outcome.<br>

The 3-month follow-up indicated that AA members had increased their
binges and more often drank in order to feel superior.

I should just photocopy it and keep it for reference.

Hello again Peter,

I have to agree, even if that sounds like a radical position.
I think it is a very sensible position.
<p>
Radical? You want radical? One friend of mine did three years in San Quentin for possession of
three marijuana cigarettes. Now that is radical. And that did no one any good whatsoever.
He was so freaked out by the experience that he spent the rest of his life hiding away from
&quot;straight society&quot; in a hippie commune in the mountains of Northern New Mexico. He died recently.

Subject:  	A.A: What's not good article<br>

<p>
Greetings,

<p>
I'd like to say that this article written under the name of A. Orange is one of the
most offensive I have read in some time. Does this person have any experience with
the program of Alcoholics Anonymous? I assume not. It sounds like a rant against a
program that he or she has no experience with. The comparisons to Hitler and Nazi
Germany and the suggestions that it is brainwashing of some sort are just ludicrous.
There is no brainwashing and there is never any condemnation. I can see how it may
look that way at times to an outsider, but I assure you that is not the nature of
the program. The program works. The reason it does not work for many more is that
they are still caught up in their selfish ways and refuse to be honest with
themselves and others about the nature of their illness. My sister is still in
active addiction and holds a lot of the same sentiments as the writer of this
article. She is also completely selfish and self-centered and refuses to even give
it a try. For most it takes hitting a bottom. For me it was multiple DUI's and then
cancer. I am a recovering alcoholic and Marine veteran. I am also a graduate student
in forensic behavior analysis. I tried to get sober every other way including
therapy and every other way on my own terms. It just doesn't work. The author of
this article seems to be a blatant atheist or agnostic. I'm not a bible thumper but
do believe in God. The program only asks that you try something new, put your faith
in something greater than your self-centered self. The program is all about being
honest and kind and serving others. Does that sound crazy? Not to me. It mirrors the
teachings of Christ and gives the recovering alcoholic a social setting with other
like-minded individuals to belong to. I hope that the writer of this article can
actually attend some meetings sometime and see that the program actually works.
Every group is not perfect, nothing is. There are many great groups all over the
world however, and I'm sure he or she could find one if they tried. I hope that the
author of this article can get a better perspective on the program instead of just
compiling all the negative facts and stats out there. Maybe actually reading the Big
Book would be a good start.

Sincerely,

<font color="blue">
Hello James,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the opinions. Starting at the top,

<ol>
<p><li>
Yes, I have experience with A.A. &#8212; read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">the introduction</a> &#8212; 
and my experience is nothing compared to that of some of the people who regularly correspond
and post articles in the forum. Some of them were in A.A. for 20 or 30 years and they can
describe A.A. experiences to you far better than I.

<p><li>
The comparisons of A.A. doctrines to the Nazi philosophy are not 
&quot;ludicrous&quot;. Bill Wilson copied all of the A.A. philosophy, cult religion,
and practices (the &quot;Steps&quot;) from Dr. Frank Buchman, who
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">regularly attended Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies</a>
and <i>Sieg-Heiled!</i> Adolf Hitler. And
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson even said so</a>.

Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion was called &quot;The Oxford Group&quot;, and William Griffith Wilson,
Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith, and Clarence Snyder were members of that cult:

<p>
<center><table width="75%" border="5" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="40" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got its ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.

<p><br>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
== William G. Wilson, <i>The Language of the Heart</i>, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Bill Wilson was being dishonest there, when he implied that
Sam Shoemaker was the leader of the Oxford Group. Frank Buchman was
the real leader, and he is the one who copied or made up
all of the theology and tenets and practices of the Oxford Group, which
Bill rewrote into the Twelve Steps. But Frank Buchman had a very bad
reputation for his praise of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi sympathizing,
so Bill Wilson listed Sam Shoemaker as the leader of the USA branch of
the Oxford Group.  Nevertheless, the theology and practices are still all pure
Buchmanism.


<p>
<li>
Likewise, the 12 Steps are obviously brainwashing techniques. Read just one page of condensed
cheat-sheet information about brainwashing from the experts:
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Cult Info</a>.
Notice the similarity between Dr. Robert J. Lifton's description of the Chinese brainwashing program
and the 12 Steps.

<p>
<li>
This is contradictory:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The program works. The reason it does not work for many more is that
they are still caught up in their selfish ways and refuse to be honest with
themselves and others about the nature of their illness.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
First it works, and then it doesn't work, and you make excuses, and blame the victim.
<p>
Actually, A.A. does not work. It just raises the binge drinking rate and the death rate in alcoholics.
You can read about the actual A.A. success rate here:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.

<p><li>
I am sorry to hear about your sister's troubles. I am also sorry to see that you are so quick
to condemn her rather viciously. 
But that is typical of how A.A. members denounce non-members. That is evidence that A.A. really is a
cult. They even have you turning against your own sister.

<p><li>
This is typical A.A. dogma, and a truism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For most it takes hitting a bottom.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course people drink until it gets bad, and is no fun any more.
While it's still fun, they continue to drink. When it gets bad, people quit.
Then A.A. calls that &quot;a bottom&quot;, however bad it got.
So everybody who ever quits drinking because of unpleasant experiences has &quot;hit bottom&quot;,
no matter whether they quit inside of A.A. or outside of it, like most successful people do.

<p>
So the jabber about &quot;hitting bottom&quot; is really pretty meaningless. We have all had bad experiences.
Some people will choose to quit drinking after some really bad experiences, and some won't.

<br>
<a name="everyway"> </a>
<p><li>
This is nonsense, and obviously untrue, but it's a common line that A.A. members parrot:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I tried to get sober every other way including
therapy and every other way on my own terms. It just doesn't work.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Did you try SMART? How about SOS or Lifering or Moderation Management or HAMS?
Or the Catholic programs like Calix or St. Vincent de Paul?
Or the Protestant Evangelist Rick Warren's Christianity-based
<a href="orange-heresy.html#Saddleback" target="_blank">Saddleback program</a>?
The Salvation Army program? The Veterans Administration program?
Brief Intervention? Rational Recovery?
<p>
For a list of 48 different programs or treatments or methods, and their effectiveness,
<a href="orange-letters252.html#Rodney_R" target="_blank">look here</a>.
<p>
You did not try every other way. So how many different ways did you really try?

<p>
Furthermore, no program &quot;works&quot; to make you quit drinking. It is always up to you.
Either you quit or you don't. Expecting a program to do the quitting for you is nuts.
Nobody holds your hand every Saturday night but you.

<p>
The phrase about &quot;on my own terms&quot; is just standard A.A. cultish self-denigration. The good
brainwashed A.A. member must incant at meetings,
<font color="#9F0000"> &quot;I tried it my way and it didn't work, so now I'm doing it God's way.&quot;</font>


<p><li>
This is the standard A.A. religious bigotry:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The author of this article seems to be a blatant atheist or agnostic. I'm not a
bible thumper but do believe in God.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
For your information, I am neither an atheist nor an agnostic. I have studied 
all of the great religions of the world, and incorporated much of their teachings into my
personal philosophy. I just do not believe in Santa Claus or Cinderella's Fairy Godmother.
<p>
I find it to be both stupid and arrogant to imagine that you can go to
an A.A. meeting and God will save you from your own self-indulgent bad
habits while He ignores all of the innocent sick and starving babies on
the other side of the world, and lets them die.
<p>
What makes you think you rate God's special attentions and miracles on demand when those
babies don't get miracles? Ego, ego, ego...


<p><li>
This is standard cult dogma:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The program only asks that you try something new, put your faith
in something greater than your self-centered self. The program is all about being
honest and kind and serving others.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The program is about declaring that you are powerless over your bad habits, and insane,
and making long confessions, and
then expecting a God to deliver miracles on demand and change you.
The program is about massive dishonesty &#8212; <i>Fake It 'Till You Make It</i>
&#8212; <i>Act As If</i> &#8212;
&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">Dole out the truth by teaspoons, not buckets</a>&quot;.
And never tell the truth about the real history of A.A., especially not about the Oxford Group and
its Nazi connections.
Also don't tell the truth about the A.A. failure rate.
And don't talk about what a lying thieving philandering LSD-gobbling con artist Bill Wilson really was.

<p>
Then the properly-indoctrinated A.A. member imagines that God is guiding him and talking to him
in Step 11 s&eacute;ances and telling him what to do and giving him the power to do it.
<p>
The talk about <i>&quot;put your faith in something greater than your self-centered self&quot;</i>
is standard cult behavior. Cults are forever demanding that people &quot;give up self&quot;.
That is one of the common cult characteristics.
Look here for the Cult Test question:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_obliterate_self" target="_blank">66. Calls to Obliterate Self</a><br>
</ul>
and here for the A.A. answer:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_obliterate_self" target="_blank">66. Calls to Obliterate Self</a>
</ul>

<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, there is no similarity between the teachings of Jesus Christ and the satanic teachings of
Dr. Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson. Jesus Christ never said,
<font color="#9F0000">
 &quot;Decieve the newcomers to get them to join our church. Reveal the truth by teaspoons, not buckets.
Only reveal the real truth
later on, after they have become committed members. 90 church services in 90 days.
Jabber thought-stopping slogans all of the time.
<i>Keep Coming Back!</i>
Parrot crazy religious dogma, and then say that it isn't religious.
<i>Surrender to me!</i>
Go to meetings and confess all of the time.
And never dispense any charity to the poor people. Make them depend of 'God'.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Umm, no, that isn't the teachings of Jesus.

Again, you should at least read

You can say the same thing about the Ku Klux Klan or Scientology or the Moonies, or the Hari Krishnas,

The whole program is wrong and bad and harmful and dishonest and lies about it's success rate.

Then you finished with some standard cultish

<p>
You have not read much of my web site, have you? I own several old copies of the <i>Big Book</i>,
ranging from the second through the fourth editions, and have a reproduction of the
original multilith edition, and I've read them.
The <i>Big Book</i> is actually the most-quoted book on the Orange Papers web site.
I feel like I have typed a large fraction of the <i>Big Book</i>.
<p>
You should peruse the bibliography. It starts with all of the regular A.A. council-approved books.
<a href="orange-bibliography.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
You don't have to actually read all of those books like I have, that would take you years.
Just read the list of books.

<p>
And I have a good perspective on the A.A. program. It is a fraud that hurts more people than it helps.
It is a hoax that does not work. It is cult religion and quack medicine.
<p>
By the way, in the interests of &quot;a better perspective on the program&quot;,
how many anti-A.A. books have you read?  May I recommend that you start with
<a href="orange-top10.html" target="_blank">the &quot;Top 10 reading list&quot;</a>?

Subject:  	Pacific Group Article<br>

<p>
Hello, I hope this email reaches the originator of an article I just read
on the Pacific Group.  Normally, I would ignore something to judgemental
and clearly inspired by an unhappy spirit.  This morning, however, I wanted
to respond.

<p>
I attend the Pacific Group.  Love the respect shown by the members there.
Sober almost 17 years, without taking meds that keep me in bondage and
render me another statistic, I am grateful that I could go to a place where
I am shown what service looks like.

<p>
Diagnosed bi-polar, manic-depressive, suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder syndrome, the trusted phyisician wanted to place me on medication
aet 8-days sober.  He said, &quot;I would have to take them for the rest of my
life.&quot;  Having taken pills in addition to drinking, I was reluctant and
elected to get a sponsor, take the steps, get commitments, change my
behavior and exorcise instead.

<p>
Was I depressed?  Well yeah! As an adult whose life had gone into the
toilet and I was homeless, I was definately depressed! A pill doesn't fix
the problem.  It medicates the problem.  I am so grateful that by the time
I found the Pacific Group, years later, I could be surrounded by members
who liked to take action and not blame others for their problems.

<p>
Turns out the doctor was wrong! I am not in need of medication!  So many
meetings have members playing doctor, telling newcomers or members who come
to a meeting once every 4 months, that they should &quot;get on something.&quot;  How
irresponsible!  No one is present any more.  I am sure the doctor thought
he was doing the right thing, but how awesome it is that I never filled
that prescription!!  My life is free and the women I work with who want to
take the steps and know that if after doing so, if they need anything to
save their life, they can get on it.  i just think it odd, they haven't ran
to the doctor.

<p>
It is an honor and a privilage to get my sponsor a cup of coffee! Someone
who for fun and for free, takes my calls, day or night, helps me thru the
process of all 12-steps, and only wants to see me live in dignity &#8212; yes! I
think coffee is the very least I can offer.

<p>
Find your own path!  Uncover your truth. Stop hiding under the veil of
hatred and contempt. What a sad sad way to exist.

<p>
Maybe you should try to be of service.  Volunteer your time at a children's
hospital, where babies have been raped and beaten by a drunk stranger or
parent (on meds) and drunk!  Go feed the homeless.  Go places where the
devastintg effects of alcohol have ravaged people's lives and homes.

<p>
Get into the solution.  Point the finger at your own life.

<p>
Candice

Hello Candice,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better.

<p>
However, it sounds like you really drank the koolaid.
The fact that you are enjoying participation in the Pacific Group does not make
it a good organization.
You have completely glossed over the problems with the Pacific Group, and gone into <i>minimization and denial</i>
mode. You didn't say anything about

<p>
<ol>
<li>

<p><li>
The sexual exploitation of women in the Pacific Group and its clones like
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">Mike Quinones' Midtown Group</a>.
Clancy would not even criticize Mike, his grand-sponsee, for turning A.A. into a sex club that
preys on young girls.


<p><li>
Would you care to comment on any or all of the issues listed here:
<a href="orange-clancy_i.html" target="_blank">The Pacific Group of Clancy I.</a>,
like invasive take-overs of neighboring groups, rigid enforcement of dogma,
suppression of dissent,
and telling sick people who really do need medications not to take their medications?

Subject:  	Hello again<br>

<p>
Orange,

<p>
Hope you don't mind me writing so frequently, work has been slow lately.

<p>
For the second time, I found myself in a huge amount of pain due to dental issues
(looks like dentures for me here shortly), with my only potential source of relief
being doctor prescribed narcotics.

<p>
Last time I just about shit a brick when they handed me a bottle of vicodin. I never
abused vicodin, because it wasn't strong enough, but just the fact this it was an
opiate squicked me out. It wasn't until I'd been home for about an hour and a half,
trying to figure out whether or not to take them, that I thought &quot;Wait, you've had
drugs for 90 minutes and haven't taken them...in fact you're kind of afraid of
taking them...that's not the behavior of an addict&quot;. And it wasn't. All was well.

<p>
So this time I was less nervous about the issue. However, I did bust
<a href="orange-addmonst.html" target="_blank">Mr. Lizard Brain</a>
trying to play his games a couple times. You're right Orange, it really is
kinda sad how lame his con games are. First, Lizard Brain thought that we should
just take a little bit more than it said on the bottle. Just to get a tiny little
buzz. I mean, we hadn't slept in days, didn't we deserve to blow off some steam?
Maybe, Lizard Brain, maybe, but not like that, we don't blow steam off that way
anymore.

<p>
The next time it started whispering, it had realized I wouldn't take more than the
recommended dose. So, it pointed out that I would still be taking the recommended
dose if I crushed and snorted the pills. It was at that point that I really had to
chuckle. Oh come on, Lizard Brain, I know all the plays in your book. I can make up
new ones, you can't.

<p>
This Saturday will be 1.5 years without a drink for me. I know it &quot;totally doesn't
count&quot;, as I just admitted to ingesting a narcotic analgesic twice in the past year,
but, well, fuck that. I also decided that I don't really give a shit if it means I
don't have years and years of clean time anymore. If taking painkillers sporadically
as legitimately prescribed by a doctor means my streak has been broken, so be it.
I'm happy not abusing the shit out of narcotics and booze, and that's what matters.

<p>
I found thinking of that part of myself as a separate entity made aligning against
it easier. It wasn't so much an internal struggle as it was me fending off bad ideas
from a bad source, plain and simple. And it wasn't real hard to do, because I'm the
one that taught it everything it knows. And for that idea, I wanted to thank you.

<p>

Hi Orange

<p>
I love your site. It just confirms what I have always found to be the best piece of
AA advice
I ever recieved. <b>&quot;Just don't XXXXing drink XXXXwit&quot;</b>.
 I try to put it differently myself but the man who said that to me saved my life.

<p>
One query &#8212; On the Effectiveness of the 12 step Treatment page
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Orford and Edwards appear to quote Vaillant</a>
 &#8212; 

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Such rates of improvement are not significantly better than those shown in studies
of the spontaneous or natural improvement of chronic drinkers not in treatment. Or,
as Vaillant once ironically remarked: &quot;The best that can be said for our exciting
treatment is that we are certainly not interfering with the normal recovery
process.&quot;12<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
However Ordford and Edwards published in 1977 and Vaillant in 1983. This appears to
be a mistake in an other wise excellant site.
I have no doubts about you conclusions and no arguement the the evidence.

<p>
Please can you clear up this minor point.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi William,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well, and enjoying
the site. Congratulations.
<p>
You are quite observant.
The confusion there is just that a third person, Dr. Herbert Fingarette, was writing about and commenting
on both the Dr. Orford and Edwards clinical test, and also quoting Dr. George Vaillant's remark about
A.A. treatment of alcoholism:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;The best that can be said for our exciting treatment is that we are certainly
not interfering with the normal recovery process.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p> 

Doctors Jim Orford and Griffith Edwards published their report
<i>Alcoholism : a comparison of treatment and advice, with a study of
the influence of marriage</i> in 1977.
<p>
Dr. George Vaillant published his remark in &quot;The Doctor's Dilemma&quot; (page 18) in 1980.
<p>
And then Dr. Herbert Fingarette published <i>Heavy Drinking</i> in 1988, quoting both of them.
See pages 78-80 and footnotes on page 94.

This is the next day. On Sunday, it got funny. I rode my bicycle all of the way around the biggest pond
at Fernhill Wetlands, looking for the goslings. And then I found them when I got back to the parking lot.
Overnight, they seem to have lost their fear of people, and they were hanging out at the parking lot and
collecting munchies from people.
<p>
I can only wonder whether my hanging out and feeding them and not bothering the goslings
on Saturday helped them
to get over their apprehension about having people around their babies. They were certainly far less
fearful on Sunday, and lounged at the parking lot, and ate the occasional piece of bread,
for hours. The only time they became nervous was
when some curious people approached too close for their liking.
(Some of these photographs look like I'm very close, but I'm not; I'm sitting a good ways back and
shooting with that 500mm Panagor telephoto lens. That leaves them with enough empty space around them for
them to feel safe.)

They didn't eat any bread the previous day, but now they
have learned that bread is good to eat. Still, they eat a proper diet, and eat a bunch of
grass along with the bread so as to have a balanced diet.
<p>
By the way, that is 15-grain bread. I always feed the goslings the good stuff. White bread is no good
for them. And moldy bread is out of the question. They can get sick from eating moldy bread just like how
we can. So the goslings get good fresh whole grain bread (surplus, a few days old, but still very good).

Subject:  	Hi, about the West Wing and AA.<br>

<p>
Hello,

<p>
My name is Brendon and I am someone who used drugs and preferred to stop
not with the help of the AA or NA programs, and for the individual
degrading qualities mentioned on your site. It's just something I feel so
against participating in, while I am not necessarily an individualist above
a collectivist, especially in my political beliefs. I do think that
recovery from addiction does not need the length and degree of conformity
and deceptiveness involved in AA.
<p>
 My question and inquiry is about
something that sort of bothered me this past night, and thus kept me up
awhile reading about AA's cultishness once again out of the pressure put on
me to partake in group support, AA in particular, as part of my
life-changes. That is, I am recently a big fan of the West Wing, but I am
21 years old and last time I watched some of the last few seasons I was
much younger, less interested, and not concerned with addiction issues. I
just started watching the West Wing first season. I sort of saw an episode
about Leo going to &quot;meetings&quot; for his past alcoholism and addiction but
didn't think much about it. Till I saw an earlier episode where Leo was
invited to the AA meetings the Vice President runs in the basement of the
EEOB. By the way, to answer your questions the particular AA is not open to
public it is a only 5 or so high Government officials and I suppose his
sponsor is one of those. But when I saw his involvement in the AA meeting
in all its secrecy and such, I was reminded of the cultishness. Like you
said <i>The West Wing</i> is a great show, but I am so majorly bummed that this is
going to be a major part of the story, or more so in Leo's story. It makes
sense that a show about a leftist Administration would espouse beliefs
about collectivist ideology, and so therefor also in the story about a
persons own issues. Although I would argue with myself collectively aimed
policy is not the same level of collective control as cult-like groups like
AA.
<p>
 To me it so unfortunately reminded me of how ingrained the AA message
and eventuality of treatment style is in American culture... and I don't
know if I will ever be able to like this show again, because of this. Do
you particular like or perhaps love the West Wing? If so, how do you see
it? Perhaps I will have to grow up a bit and realize it's only a fucking
show, one I thought was really good, but that I don't have to take so much
of it to heart. I'd really appreciate you sharing your opinion on it with
me, above and beyond what you said
<a href="orange-random.html#West_Wing" target="_blank">on your Random Thoughts page</a>. But
perhaps you do not use this email or run your site actively anymore so I
expect you might not respond.

<p>
Thank you,<br>

Hello Brendon,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I have to agree that it is a mixed message.  <i>The West Wing</i>'s general
philosophy is left-wing and liberal. But then the script writer mixed in a bunch of basically fascistic
stuff about how your thinking is defective and you need to be supervised by somebody else.
<p>
I don't know much about Hollywood personalities, and don't pay a lot of attention to them,
so I'm not hip to all of the details of their lives. But
<a href="orange-letters228.html#West_Wing" target="_blank">someone wrote to me to explain</a> that
<font color="black">
&quot;Screen writer &amp; playwright Aaron Sorkin, the creator and an original writer of
<i>The West Wing</i>, has been a huge advocate for AA.&quot;
</font>
<p>
And before that, we were discussing
<a href="orange-letters226.html#Charlie_Sheen" target="_blank">Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen and
<i>The West Wing</i> here</a>.
There I learned that Martin Sheen was also a big Stepper. So Charlie Sheen was not only rebelling against
the 12-Step cult, he was also rebelling against his own father and his father's philosophy.

<p>
Then, somewhere, I heard that the actor who played Leo was also an alcoholic and a Stepper.
So, yes, they had plenty of people who wanted to &quot;carry the message&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
<i>The West Wing</i> was such a mixed bag that some of the teachings about alcoholism or
addiction were true, or half true. For example, in one episode, one of the young
staffers (whose name I cannot remember) was suffering from PTSD, I think after
getting shot. Leo was helping him to get through it, and get therapy. At the end
of the episode, Leo explained his actions with this story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There was a man stuck down in a hole, and he couldn't figure out how to get out.  Another man came along,
and saw the man down in the hole. The guy in the hole asked for help in getting out. The second man jumped
down into the hole.<br>
The first man asked, &quot;Now why did you do that idiot thing? Now we are both stuck down in the hole!&quot;<br>
The second man answered, &quot;Yes, but I've been down in this hole before, and I know how to get out.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now I can appreciate that sentiment. Leo had been down in that hole, and got out. And I was also down in that
hole, and got out.
And we are both interested in helping others to get out of that hole.
I totally agree with that idea in the story.
But the West Wing scripts were also implying that A.A. is good help for getting out of that hole.
I strongly disagree with that propaganda because the facts say otherwise.
 
<p>
You asked whether I liked <i>The West Wing</i>. Well, yes, lots of episodes. Unfortunately, I felt like
gagging when they started pushing the A.A. cult as salvation for alcoholics.
But some other episodes were quite good. So yes, it's a mixed bag. But, like you, I cannot love it without reservations.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Terry,

<p>
Ian here, the Nikon-user at the marina with whom you so graciously shared
information about older lenses.

<p>
I just spent about four hours reading your very interesting site &#8212; not
nearly enough time to finish. I admire your passion for truth, your
willingness to speak out and your civility toward those who disagree with
you. I wish that our country had more people who were willing make rational
moral arguments and follow the rules of civil democratic dialogue. It's an
increasingly rare ability and I fear for our country because of that fact.

<p>
I've discovered that one sometimes pays a personal price for telling the
truth. I could tell you about that some time.

<p>
I've also discovered that sometimes I myself have been at odds with the
truth, i.e., that I am capable of self-deception, and of getting caught up
in false ideologies. Sometimes I think I should take a holiday from
argumentation. Coincidentally, I was a member of various 12-Step Groups
until quite recently. It was only last year that I found I could not bring
myself to continue to attend &#8212; even though I very much liked some of the
members of the groups.

<p>
I, too, am something of a writer and essayist. I'll insert an essay that I
wrote about ten years ago and recently revised. I think you might enjoy it
since it deals with an interesting period of history in the ancient world.
(Don't be put off by the title. It is not a fundamentalist screed. In fact,
it deals with a period of war in ancient Greece, long before the advent of
Chnristianity.)

<p>
I hope you got some good pictures of the geese.

<p>
I'll send a pic or two of mine. Here's Beethoven, as you called him. Below is
a pic of some geese at the Milwaukie waterfront and other gulls at the
Milwaukie waterfront on a misty day.

Hello Ian,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the compliments, and your slant on recovery.
<p>
And thanks for the pictures.
Oh, I especially like that second shot, the Milwaukee waterfront. It just has something about it.
The atmosphere is stunning. I can't help but think of Jurassic Park.

<p>
We were talking about the legendary old Vivitar Series 1 70-210mm lenses, and I
mentioned the Kiron 70 to 210mm F4.0 zoom lens that was made by the same company
as made some of the Series 1 lenses  &#8212;  Kino Precision Optical Company of Japan Ltd.
And many lens aficionados consider it to be equal to the Vivitar Series 1 lenses.
They do resolution tests where they photograph test patterns with finer and finer line pairs,
finding the limits of resolution of the lens. They rate that Kiron lens as equal to the legendary
Vivitar Series 1 lenses.
<p>
Here are three shots of juvenile California Gulls taken with such a Kiron lens on an Olympus E-510 body:
(I think this one is Nikon mount, mounted on the Olympus E-510 with an adapter. Happily, I have several,
in both Nikon and Pentax mounts.)
Unfortunately, these copies were scaled down for uploading to myspace.com.
I can't find the originals right now. They show much greater sharpness and resolution.

are on one of those concrete fence-posts on the seawall. You might notice how fastidious young gulls are
when they eat. (Not!)

<p>
You can find such Kiron lenses on eBay for $20 to $30, plus shipping. Ignore the ads where some dealer buys
one cheap and then jacks the price up to $80 or $90.  And of course they are also available in a
variety of mounts, including Pentax PK mount.
<p>
Speaking of old lenses, here is a shot with an old Sears 300mm prime lens. (Pentax mount, mounted on the Olympus
camera with an adapter). This was taken down at the marina, where the floating restaurant is.
The young gull was glaring at me like that because he wanted me to toss him some bread. He saw me
feeding the other gulls, so he wanted me to stop taking pictures and give him some bread. After I got
this shot, I did.

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
I just read one of your replies to
<a href="orange-letters301.html#Hugh_G2" target="_blank">Hugh G on the 16th April</a>
where you stated......&quot;
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
But what I really want is &quot;Old Age Anonymous&quot;. I mean, if all things are
possible with God, then surely 12-Step meetings can be the Fountain of Youth,
can't they? I want eternal youth. (Or at least a few million years of it...)<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
I always wondered why the AA God couldn't just make people be able to drink normally
like normies?  I did ask an AA old-timer guru that very question years ago and was
met with silence.

<p>
&quot;But there is One who has all power.  That one is God.  May you find him now&quot;  Big
Book Fourth Edition Page 59

<p>
Surely for One with all power it should be just as easy to miracle people to be able
to drink normally as it is to miracle them into stopping drinking completely? It
doesn't actually say anything about stopping drinking in the 12 steps does it?   God
must like drinking afterall else why would Jesus change the water into wine at the
Marriage feast?

<p>
And as you quite rightly say God should also be able to make steppers live forever
if he has all power.   You could go to Controlled Drinking Anonymous one night a
week,  Old Age Anonymous another night then go to the pub the other five nights a
week and be able to drink normally for ever and ever.   (or a least for a few
million years :-)

<p>
I'm just off to have a spiritual experience and start Controlled Drinking Anonymous
then I'm off to the pub, do they still do that belladonna treatment that Bill Wilson
had?

<p>
Seriously though if it wasn't for the messed up lives and deaths and misery this
evil cult continues to cause  with the blessing of the general public, the whole 12
step concept would be just one big hilarious joke.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Laurence,
<p>
Thanks for the laugh. That's good. And I couldn't agree more.
<p>
Have a good day now.
