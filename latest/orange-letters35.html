Subject:  	Kudos bro!!!!!<br>

<p>

Congrats on a well researched, fine piece of  work. I have only read a
small part of it but this is the truth as it needed to be told.The first
cult I was suckered into was Jehovah's Witnesses.My Grandmother took me
to my forst meeting as a teenager and when I finally broke away a few
years later it took a lot of research on my part to discredit them and
this is one of the reasons I was never comfortable in AA because I
instinctively recognized efforts to influence my thinking and destroy my
personal autonomy. Do you mind if I download or print parts of your
Orange papers to show others?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ben,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.
<p>
Go for it. Help to spread the word, and all that.
</font>
<p>


I am quite certain Alcoholics has caused a
great deal of damage and will continue to do so. And the fact that AA
has become so thoroughly entrenched in the legal system in this
appalling. Forcing people to attend meetings is a violation of civil and
human rights. Let me know if I can have your permission to show this
work to others.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, you do.
</font>
<p>


Of course I will continue to read more. Bill Wilson was a
nut. All cult leaders were, including J.C. himself. I hope to live long
enough to help undo some of the damage people seem so ready to inflict
on each other. Live long and prosper!!!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, I think I'd have to exclude J.C. from that nutcase category,
when I read his sermon on the mount. Undoubtedly,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Moses_genocide">many of His predecessors</a>
and followers were.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Andrew B.&quot; <br>

<p>
Dear Orange,
<p>
Thanks for your brilliant web-site!  I thought it was ironic that you
happened to mention
<a href="orange-big_lie.html">Renascent</a>. 
 Many of my &quot;recovery&quot; friends have been
through there, and I have walked by the building on many occasions because
it is in my neighbourhood in Toronto.  Outside the building, in addition to
the many sullen, coffee drinking, chain-smoking &quot;grateful&quot; alcoholics, you
will notice a brand new yellow Camaro.  The owner?  The Director, of course.
Only in the recovery industry could a man with little training (outside AA)
and no credentials procure such a career.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Andrew,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for all of the thanks.
<p>
Can you collect more information on Renascent? Just whatever you run across.
Anything and everything would be
interesting, and maybe helpful. Exactly what &quot;credentials&quot; does the Director of
Renascent have?
What is his salary? I'm not sure how the laws of Canada work, but in the USA, the
finances of non-profit corporations are an open book, and their filings are available
for public inspection.
It would be interesting to see what a self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; on
addictions makes.
</font>
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
Oh, and other readers: Do you have any juicy tidbits on your local corrupt
12-Step fraud &#8212; a.k.a. &quot;treatment center&quot;?
</font>

<p>
I have been through the AA/treatment mill, and web sites like yours give me
hope.  In Canada, there is a whole industry run by the Society of St.
Vincent de Paul, that houses men who are addicted, taking their welfare
cheques, and mandates 12-step attendance.  The catch?  If and when a person
relapses they are evicted instantly and get none of their rent money back.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hmmm. It's hard to see how that is &quot;Christian&quot; behavior.
</font>
<p>

<p>
Thank you for exposing the myth and downright treachery of the 12-step
industry.
<p>
Here's hoping that its days are numbered, and tax dollars can be spent on
medical treatment for addiction and real counselling for those in need
instead of pseudo-religious bullshit!
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Andrew B.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yeh, really. You have a good day too.

From:  	&quot;Kenny L.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	A.A. as a cult.<br>

<p>

Is A.A. a cult? Well, since I'm generally happy, optomistic, loving,
caring (twords all), respectful, unchained from the booze, etc... and
have a desire to live again.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Kenny,
<p>
Congratulations on your sobriety. It's nice how breaking the alcohol addiction makes
people feel so much better. And the really nice thing is that it works even outside
of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Obviously, your improved mental state comes from not killing yourself with ethyl
alcohol any more, rather than from any cult that you may be visiting.
</font>
<p>


And I only got this from my A.A. fellowship
and the steps.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Obviously, you don't know what caused the improvements. It's the
&quot;no alcohol&quot; that does it, not &quot;the fellowship&quot;.
<p>
Besides, you didn't try a lot of other things, did you?
So you can't declare that the improvements come only from some &quot;fellowship&quot;.
<p>
How many other programs did you work?
For how many years? How thoroughly?
Did you actually quit drinking at any other time, in any other program?
Then you can't blame the program for not working, when you didn't work the program,
now can you?
</font>
<p>


Then it doesn't matter to me personally. It will matter
to a possible newcomer. Most of us have tried all the different ways to
stop and stay stopped drinking.
Usually A.A. is the last stop.
<p>
<font color="blue">
<i>All of the different ways?</i>
Please list them. Vague grand hand-waving doesn't make it.

<p>
Of course A.A. was the last stop for you, because you quit looking for other programs when you 
quit drinking. But what about the other people, the millions of other people
who quit A.A. and also quit drinking some other way? You don't count them, do you?
You don't even talk to them. So what do you really know?

</font>
<p>


The last
thing we want to do is to be controled by any group or individual.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. You spend your life in a mind-controlling cult, jabbering
illogical platitudes like this letter.
</font>
<p>


You
have most likely turned off a person looking to get sober by
participating in our program.* You* can tell his family that your
negative input may have helped him to stay away from getting help from a
sucsessful program.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's just some more standard Alcoholics Anonymous
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#emotions">fear mongering</a> &#8212;
a very common A.A. mind game and propaganda trick.
You are proving my points for me. That's what cults do &#8212; fear-monger and play mind games
on people
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html# Vaillant_deaths">
And Alcoholics Anonymous is not a successful program; it is a total failure</a>.
The only people who quit drinking in A.A. are a small minority of those people who
were going to quit anyway. Alcoholics Anonymous merely steals the credit
from a few cases of spontaneous remission.

<p>
You are also using the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#emotions">
<i>Sly Suggestions</i></a>.
&quot;You <i>MAY HAVE</i> caused his death.&quot;
Or maybe drugs and alcohol caused it. Or maybe mental illness caused it.
Or maybe nothing caused it &#8212; maybe he didn't die.
<p>
Speaking of deaths:
Do you go to the houses of
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">the A.A. suicides</a>
and apologize to the families for
having caused their deaths with cult religion? Why not?

</font>
<p>

We as members benefit greatly by having new people come into the
program.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is typical of cults. You always need new blood and fresh meat.
</font>
<p>

We get to see them go from self hatred to self love.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Baloney. Alcoholics Anonymous teaches immense amounts of self-hatred and self-contempt.
Read
&quot;<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i>
Conspiracy</a>&quot;.
A.A. ex-members tell me that it takes years to overcome the psychological damage caused
by the constant A.A. put-downs and criticism.
</font>
<p>
We get to
hear their stories of reuniting with their familys'.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yeh? Like
<a href="orange-letters14.html#horrors">this one</a>?
</font>
<p>

We get to hear about their job promotions. etc...
I think it is called Joy that we
receive from new or current members. Not a bad cult.

<p>
Ken. L.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Not a bad cult?
As compared to the Moonies and Scientology?
<p>
I noticed that you kept talking about how much you enjoyed new members, not
how much the new members benefitted from the A.A. routine.
<p>
And what you really never did is compare the stories of people who quit drinking
inside A.A. with the stories of people who quit outside A.A., so see if there are
really any benefits to A.A. membership.
<p>
And you also seem to be ignoring all of the horror stories that people tell me
about their experiences in Alcoholics Anonymous. You should read
<a href="orange-letters29.html#horrors">the files of letters</a>
that I get.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	RE: A.A. as a cult.<br>

<p>

Hi Orange.
<p>
You sure did a lot of assuming about what I tried and didn't try. And
what I learned from the program or from not drinking. I don't recall saying that
A.A. is the only way to get and stay sober.
<p>
<font color="blue">
But you did say,
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Most of us have tried all the different ways to stop and stay stopped
drinking. Usually A.A. is the last stop.&quot;</i></font>,
which means just about the same thing.
<p>
And that statement is totally untrue.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">What the Harvard Medical
School says</a>
is that 80% of the people who successfully
quit drinking for a year or more do it alone.
So &quot;do it yourself&quot; is really the last stop for the vast majority of alcoholics.
</font>
<p>



I didn't put down any other programs.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Well implying that the other programs do not work, and that A.A. is the last stop,
sure sounds like putting other programs down.
</font>
<p>

I don't care how someone gets sober. I didn't go through all of you web site, but
Hopefully you had enough decensy to suggest some alternative programs for people to
try.

Howdy Agent Orange,

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Your site has been of great help to me. Having ridden the RGM's
merry go round a few times with no success I felt like a failure. AA
just didn't work for me and it wasn't due to lack of effort on my part,
although thats what I was being told.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Jeff,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. Glad to be of help.
</font>
<p>

&quot;The Lord helps those who help themselves&quot; is what I was taught in
my religious upbringing. So, I googled about on the internet for non 12
step methods to quit drinking. I found Rational Recovery and have been
using AVRT. I haven't drank alcohol since then, late June of 2004, and
am amazed at how simple and relatively easy quitting drinking and later
quitting cigarettes was.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations! That is great, especially getting rid of both alcohol and tobacco.
Pretty soon you will be feeling like King Kong.
</font>
<p>

This fall I was told about your site during a conversation with
another x-AAer. It all seems so clear now. AA isn't about quiting
drinking, it's about recruiting new members for the cult and keeping
those in the cult stuck there. That really pisses me off and I think
that is a good thing. After reading through all that is on the
Orange-Papers I consider myself lucky to have gotten out of the cult
alive and in good mental health. Speaking of mental health, I'm also
pissed off about how the ATI pushes 12 step &quot;treatment&quot; without
presenting alternative treatment that actually works and doesn't require
a lifetime of being in recovery, going to meetings, recruiting new cult
members, and being &quot;diseased&quot;.
<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

It would be great to see the media explore the effectiveness of 12
stepping, the cost in $, and the harm done to those who are unknowingly
sent into the 12 step ATI under the guise of &quot;treatment&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Thankyou for the info,<br>
Jeff

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks again for the thanks, Jeff.
<p>
I agree that the media ought to be covering this issue. The silence is deafening.
We basically do not have an active, free media much anymore.

The media have been making just a little noise, lately.

Date:  	Sun, January 22, 2006<br>
From:  	&quot;MS R W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Literature Craziness<br>

<p>
Hello Orange:

<p>
I hope you are well.  Sorry to hear about the AOL fuss.  Did pass the
info along to the 12-step free zone, a CC, I believe was hoping to hear
from you.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi RW,
<p>
Good to hear from you again. Yes, I am well. And AOL has knocked off the blocking.
</font>
<p>

Anyway, was wondering if you could clear up a bit of AA craziness.
Amazon.com lists  the publisher of the book Alcoholics Anonymous as
Hazelden (you have to click on the title Alcoholics Anonymous, and
scroll to the bottom of the next page and look at product details).  And
it says the author is AAWS.  People who have copies of the book (4th
edition) say the publisher is AAWS.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Can you figure this out?  Went on a sober chat and they seemed offended
that Hazleden has anything to do with AA.  I don't understand this,
doesn't Hazleden use 12 steps in their rehabs?  People seemed very
offended that Hazleden or anyone else should make money off a
&quot;shoestring outfit like AAWS.&quot;  Of course I had to put my two bits in
while I was there &#8212; I am really appalled at the way they handle
criticism of the program, stupid insults, more stupid insults, and of
course, the truly insane suggestion that I try the steps, and can't
possibly happy without a god in my life. Then they accused me of
drinking.  I got no response to the question &quot;Do you think attending AA
meetings has limited your abilitity to express yourself?&quot;  I was,
however, invited to &quot;lift up my skirt and fight like a man,&quot; (I had
signed in as a man)  is it only in AA that a real man is defined by his
ability and/or desire to view and discuss another man's equipment?  I
don't understand why if they thought I was a man, I'd  be wearing a
skirt.  Must have missed the step that explains that one.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Do AAWS and Hazleden both publish AA literature?  Is AAWS a publishing
company?  Is Hazelden employed by AAWS to publish the book, and if the
only products coming from Hazlden support and advertise the AA &quot;product&quot;
would it be fair to say Hazleden is part of AA or exists only with the
support of AA?  Does AA contribute to Hazleden?  Is Hazleden really
non-profit?

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Anyway, I'm getting tired of looking up information, finding the
information, mentioning the information and being told I'm not getting
my facts straight.  How am I supposed to my facts straight when AA is
on an all out campaign to keep the facts a secret or present them in
such a way no one knows what's going on?

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Tattle

<p>
<font color="blue">
You have your facts basically straight. Hazelden and AAWS are very much in
bed together. Hazelden is the biggest publisher of pro-AA and pro-12-Step titles
in the world. They publish far more titles than AAWS.
They even publish the lunatic fringe titles, like how to use the 12 Steps to
treat &quot;spiritual diseases&quot; like &quot;codependency&quot;, and
how to quit smoking with the 12 Steps.
(I'll give you one guess how well that works.)
Go to
<a href="orange-bibliography.html">the bibliography</a>,
and search the page for Hazelden, and you will find a bunch
of titles.

<p>
AAWS only publishes about 30 titles, including the <i>Big Book</i>,
<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
<i>PASS IT ON</i>,
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, and a few minor titles.

And of course there is the perennial republishing
of Bill's Bull, squeezing more profits out of excerpts from Bill's lectures and sermons
that were published in 
<i>The A.A. Grapevine</i>, in books like <i>As Bill Sees It</i> and the various
books of daily meditations that feature one of Bill's crazy sayings for every day.
<p>

Hazelden, on the other hand, has a list of hundreds of published titles.


<p>
Hazelden is a strange beast. Technically, they are a very rich non-profit corporation.
They run a big expensive 50-year-old rehab / treatment center at Center City, Minnesota,
which charges $15,000 for a 28-day-long A.A. meeting, where you must complete Steps 1 through
5 before you &quot;graduate&quot;. (See the story about
<a href="orange-coffee.html">The Hazelden Coffee War</a>.)

Hazelden is also a large publishing house. They publish a zillion
pro-AA and 12-Step books.
Hazelden is also a book distributor, and they are
the biggest distributor of AAWS books that there is.
(You give Hazelden $15,000 for &quot;treatment&quot;, and they
&quot;give&quot; you a &quot;free&quot; <i>Big Book</i>.)
And Hazelden is also the biggest proselytizer and promoter of A.A. in the
world.
<p>
Some years ago, the California State Supreme Court ordered Hazelden to
remove all of their books and literature from the California Youth Authority schools,
and all of the AAWS books and literature too,
because Hazelden was obviously promoting their 12-Step religion.

<p>
Hazelden is undeniably, unashamedly, unabashedly, openly a front for Alcoholics Anonymous.
Hazelden was founded 50 years ago to promote A.A. and to give 12-Step treatment to alcoholics,
and it is still doing it.
Hazelden is one of those &quot;alky farms&quot; that Bill Wilson envisioned during the beginning
days of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Now, about the publishing of the <i>Big Book</i>. I never heard of AAWS licensing the
printing of the <i>Big Book</i> to Hazelden, although it is possible. Still, I don't
see any reason for them to change their usual behavior. Usually, AAWS prints and wholesales
the <i>Big Book</i>, and Hazelden distributes it. It's been that way for a long time, and
still is, as far as I know. The copy of the 4th edition that I have clearly says that
it is published by AAWS. There is no mention of Hazelden anywhere on it.
Now this is the hardcover edition, ISBN 1-893007-16-2, 2nd edition, 2002.
(That is the same number as Amazon lists
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005146/http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1893007162/ref=pd_ys_pym_all_5/002-3068344-6623230?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">
on that web page</a>.)
It is possible that AAWS might have decided to do some kind of a business deal to
have Hazelden reprinting the book in paperback or something.
AAWS still owns the copyright. It very clearly says &quot;Copyright Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc.&quot;

<p>
And in fact, Amazon shows AAWS to own the copyright. See:<br>
<font size="-1">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005146/http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1893007170/ref=sib_dp_top_cr/002-3068344-6623230?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;p=S006#reader-link">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1893007170/ref=sib_dp_top_cr/002-3068344-6623230?%5Fencoding=UTF8&p;=S006#reader-link</a>
</font>

<p>
So until I see a copy that says something different, I will assume that the web
page on Amazon contains a typographical error, and that AAWS is the publisher, and
Hazelden is the distributor.



<p>

Have a good day.

<p>
Are you a alcoholic? From reading your article i would guess not.And if
your not,i would suggest this to you, try drinking untill you addicted
and then try to stop.

<p>
Your ignorance is amazing.The drink is a small part of it.In fact
its only a symptom of a larger problem.Alcoholism is not a drinking
problem its a thinking problem.AA not only helps me to stop from takeing
the first drink ,but how to live life as GOD would have me live it.Not
how someone else or AA would have me live my life.As a matter of
fact,know one has ever told me how to live my life at  a  AA meeting.

<p>
I just think your way off base here.You might want to attend an AA open
meeting if you would like to understand how it works ,and why it works.

<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Todd,
<p>
Please read a little bit before deciding that you know all about me
and that my &quot;ignorance is amazing.&quot;  If you had bothered to just
read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>
to the web site, just the first small page of the
web site, you would have learned that I most assuredly am an alcoholic &#8212;
and an old alcoholic who has gone to a lot of A.A. meetings.
<p>
I am also an old alcoholic
<a href="orange-letters24.html#electrocuted">who went into DT's</a>
and was shaking and jerking
like I was being electrocuted, the first time I quit drinking, about 17
years ago, so I have also drank until I was addicted, and then tried to quit.
And I succeeded in quitting, and stayed sober for 3 years after that.
And then I went out and drank for 9 more years.
That's in the web site too, several times. You just didn't bother to
read before deciding that I was ignorant about alcoholism.

<p>
It's getting old, you know, how routinely the Alcoholics Anonymous true believers insist
that I can't be a real alcoholic, because I quit drinking without A.A. or Bill Wilson
or his 12-Step dance.  Look
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-letters3.html#real_alcoholic">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters4.html#real_alcoholic">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters15.html#real_alcoholic">here</a>, and
<li> <a href="orange-letters22.html#real_alcoholic">here</a>.
</ul>
<p>
It's just a form of denial, you know. I am living proof of the fact that A.A. is
unnecessary, and that people can successfully quit drinking without the 12-Step
cult, but the A.A. believers just don't want to hear about it.
So they use the
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman">Real Scotsman</a>&quot;
logical fallacy, and claim that I must not be a real alcoholic.
The funny thing is, A.A. members are the only people in the world who are
saying that I am not an alcoholic.
My doctor says that I am. My family says that I am. My friends agree that I am.
Everybody who knows me well says that I am.
Only A.A. is in denial about it.

<p>
Your letter is loaded with
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_thought_stop">the usual thought-stopping A.A. slogans</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_dont_trust_mind">put-downs</a> &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Alcoholism is not a drinking problem; it's a thinking problem.&quot;</font>, etc....
<p>
Of course alcoholism is a drinking problem.
If you don't drink too much, then you aren't an alcoholic.
Alcoholism is also a feeling problem just as
much as it is &quot;a thinking problem&quot;. The single commonest cause for people
drinking too much is because they feel bad and they want to feel good.

<p>
Just for the fun of it, why don't you
<a href="orange-letters25.html#alcoholic_def">define the word &quot;alcoholism&quot;</a>
for us?
Is alcoholism habitually drinking too much alcohol, or is alcoholism
a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; over which you are &quot;powerless&quot;?

<p>
Oh, and if GOD has any plan for you, I don't think it is to waste your
life in cult meetings, mindlessly parrotting slogans and talking about how
powerless you are.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Re: AA 1st Step<br>

<p>

Hi Orange,
<p>
Well you are correct on one thing, I did only read  the introduction. not
only did I not read anymore of it but I totally dismissed you thoughts
on this issue.
<p>
The part I did read, ill admit infuriated me. I will go back and read your
article in its entirety.
<p>
My point is that you may not think AA works along with its slogans and
such,but it works for me.I have managed to stay sober with AA for 10
years.I will admit I have slipped in the past ,but looking at the whole
picture for me, AA was the, and is the only thing that will continuously
keep me sane and sober.I have tried to stay sober with and without AA
and I have never succeeded without.I just don't understand how or why
you so harshly put down a program witch has helped so many.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Todd,
<p>
What you are doing is called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">Confusing Causation with Correlation</a>&quot;.
There is no evidence that &quot;it works&quot;.

<p>
To say
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I never quit drinking until I went to A.A.&quot;<br>
</font>
makes no more sense than saying,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I never quit drinking until the year 1987. Therefore 1987 is the magic
year that made me quit drinking.&quot;
</font>

<p>
What really made you quit drinking was your decision to quit drinking.
You got sick and tired of being sick and tired, so you decided to quit.
That happened after you had suffered enough years of sickness and hangovers,
and all of the rest of it.
<p>
And you decided to finally go to A.A. and see if they could teach you something.
They immediately set to work to fool you into thinking that they made you quit
drinking.
<p>
You also backslid now and then because you thought you could drink just one or
just a few, now and then, after a while.
And after several failures, you learned that you couldn't just have a few now
and then (because you imagined that you had 'recovered', or 'you had it under control now').
<p>
Nowhere in there was A.A. the <i>Cause</i> of your sobriety.<br>
Nowhere in there was A.A. &quot;working&quot;.

</font>
<p>
And I dont understand why you call AA a cult. A majority of the people
ive come to know in AA are all GOD loving people of many different
denominations and backgrounds. I guess you can put a cult tag on
anything that you disagree with .
<p>
<font color="blue">
No, when I call something a cult, the word has a very specific meaning.
Read
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a> &#8212; the whole thing, questions and answers.
I explained it all in detail.
<p>
By the way, the statement
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;I guess you can put a cult tag on anything that you disagree with&quot;</i>
</font>

is two propaganda tricks:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>,
and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem">ad hominem</a>.
</font>
<p>

<p>
well Orange i respect your opinions even though i may not agree [from
what ive read anyway]
<p>
And your answer to your question on my definition of a alcoholic as i
understand it is simply,&quot;Who i am ,and what i do i do about it&quot;

<p>

Todd G.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Huh? That is not a definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot; or &quot;alcoholism&quot;.

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Dear Mr. Orange (Sorry can't find your first name),

<p>
I am reading your website with great interest &#8212; might take me a few
years to get thru it tho'...

<p>
My background &#8212; member of an allied 12-Step group. Dropped out due to
the attitude and behaviour of group, plus growing realisation of the
damage and half-truths &#8212; or half-lies &#8212; propagated by the AA 12-Step
movement.

<p>
How about this one: A father is &#8212; according to AA &#8212; powerless over
alcohol (Step 1) and cannot even have one drink (&quot;One drink, one
drunk&quot;). So how does AA explain: A man with a very serious drink
problem:
<ul>
<li>
a) Stopping /on his own/, which AA says is impossible
(&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;),
<li>
b) Doing what AA says is even more
impossible: drinking -eventually- in moderation by which I mean one
whisky or one glass of wine &#8212; which regime he maintained from the time
he stopped serious drinking thoughout the last 20 years of his life. He
was never seen or reported &#8212; even remotely &#8212; drunk for the remaining
years of his life!
</ul>

<p>
I wonder what would have happened if this man had gone to AA and been
told &quot;You've got it for life, you can never drink again, and if you do
you'll go on a bender automatically&quot;. Well this man didn't. I wonder how
many people attending AA are brainwashed into thinking they're incurable.

<p>
I think what is a sad is that there are genuine people coming together
to help each other in a spirit of goodwill, but the rules of interaction
are determined by a flawed, dangerous, and non-sensical philosophy.

<p>
Regards,<br>
Mark

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mark,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I couldn't agree more.
The Steppers' standard answer is to declare that
<a href="orange-letters35.html#real_alcoholic">I am not &quot;a real alcoholic&quot;</a>
because
I quit drinking without practicing Bill Wilson's occult nonsense.
Thus, with the wave of a hand, they blithely dismiss all evidence that their dogma is untrue.
That just proves that it really is a cult.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Suggested Reading<br>

<p>

Hello,

<p>

I just stumbled across your site, &quot;The Twelve Steps, Interpreted&quot; and
wanted to let you know that the Holy Bible was the original source book
for the founders of AA. For more information, visit Dick B's web site
(http://www.dickb.com/index.shtml) and consider obtaining a copy of his
book, THE GOOD BOOK AND THE BIG BOOK; A.A.'s Roots in the Bible
(http://www.dickb.com/goodbook.shtml).

<p>

In reading through your site, it would seem clear that you have no idea
what it is to be an alcoholic &#8212; the incomprehensible demoralization, the
cravings, etcetera. You talk like any ?normal? person who has no
understanding of the disease &#8212; and it is a disease &#8212; a disease a real as
any other disease. Just because you do not suffer from it and do not
understand the nature of the disease doesn't mean it is not a disease. I
would strongly suggest you go visit some detox centers and/or hospitals
and spend a good amount of time talking to those who you claim are
simply making bad choices. And do it with an open mind and heart,
instead of the closed one you present on your site. Pray before you go
and ask God to open your heart and your eyes.

<p>

Grace and peace,<br>

Karl


<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Karl,
<p>
You've got it all wrong. You should actually read a little more of my web
site before jumping to conclusions. I am an old alcoholic &#8212; just an old alcoholic
who doesn't buy into the A.A. cult dogma and misinformation about alcoholism.
Start by reading
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction to the web site</a>.
Then read this discussion about
&quot;<a href="orange-letters35.html#real_alcoholic">a real alcoholic</a>&quot;.

<p>
I not only know about Dick B.'s web site, but we have corresponded and he sent me
a huge load of his books. (Thank you, Dick.) Where Dick and I disagree is over the
issue of how holy the Akron Oxford Group really was. He thinks that it was a holy
thing, a gift from God. I think that it was an evil cult.

<p>
The Oxford Groups actually drew very little from the Bible. That was mostly a Public
Relations act that they put on &#8212; pretending to be Christian.
Frank Buchman made up his own theology. He considered his own received
&quot;Guidance&quot; to be just as authoritive as anything in the Bible.
And
<a href="orange-rroot450.html">
Frank Buchman abandoned Christianity</a> when it was politically convenient.
<p>
<a href="orange-rroot570.html#Popes_ban">
The Catholic Church banned Frank's cult twice</a>, because it was so heretical and unChristian.
<p>
Also look at
<a href="orange-letters33.html#Catholic_influence">
this rap about the conflicts between Christian beliefs and Buchmanism</a>.

<p>
Anybody can pretend to be religious and holy by putting on airs and quoting the Bible a lot.
But when they actually practice fascism and praise Adolf Hitler and the Nazis,
and sneer at the poor while living in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, then you
know that there is something very wrong with that picture.

<p>
You should read
<a href="orange-religiousroots.html">
The Religious Roots of the 12 Steps</a> &#8212; the whole thing.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Re: Suggested Reading<br>

<p>

Thank you, AO, for your reply.

<p>

Since your site has many pages and none of the links to those pages
gives any indication as to your being an alcoholic, it would take a long
time for me to read through everything you have to discover what I'm
looking for.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Karl. Okay, so anyway, now you know.
</font>
<p>

Just so you know, I am a recovered alcoholic as well, a little over six
years now. Additionally, I do not find A.A. particularly relevant now
that I am recovered. I know it is suggested that I give back what was
given to me, but what was given to me did not come from A.A. HOWEVER,
A.A. played an integral part of my initial recovery.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your sobriety.
</font>
<p>

You see, back in '87 I put in a couple of years in A.A. Initially it was
a ploy to have a judge go easy on me. It worked. I continued to stick
around and became active in a sobriety &quot;club&quot; where meetings were held
(AA, NA, Al-Anon, etc.). I &quot;worked the steps&quot; as was convenient for me.
All the time, however, I never truly saw myself as an alcoholic &quot;of the
hopeless variety.&quot; By '89 I was back out drinking and drugging.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

On July 10, 1999, I called a man I had heard speaking in meetings that I
had recently returned to. This time I was attending meetings of my own
volition. I knew I was out of control and was searching for some kind of
answer. I knew about A.A. and figured that was as good a place as any to
start. I knew that my drinking &quot;was but a symptom&quot; so I figured if I
could get sober, perhaps I could discover what my drinking was a symptom
of.  I figured right. My lifestyle was a symptom of my feelings toward
God &#8212; as I misunderstood him. The man whom I called on July 10, 1999 was
not only a recovered alcoholic, he was also a man of God. After pouring
my heart out to him for two hours I asked what was next. He said, &quot;90
meeting in 90 days and start going to church.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

I hadn't been to church since I was a teenager &#8212; which was when I had my
falling out with God. (To get a better understanding of that &quot;falling
out,&quot; see my brief testimony here:
http://kdr.focusedandfree.com/bio.htm.) I began attending church and did
my 90-in-90. Naturally, none of it was easy nor felt good, but I knew I
did not want to go back to living as I had for so long. I wanted to be
free from all the pain and anger I had been harboring and feeding on for
the last 30 years.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

A.A. helped me get sober and learn what was eating my lunch. But it was
going to church and drawing near to God that was the healing agent in my
life. After a year, I dropped A.A. After 4 years, I dropped church as
well. Attending meetings &#8212; both A.A. and church meetings &#8212; was essential
and necessary for me for a time, but that time has passed. I quit
attending both A.A. and church for the same reason a person is released
from a hospital &#8212; I was healed.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You are assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none existed.
<p>
The real cause of your sobriety was your decision to quit drinking.
<p>
After 10 years of partying your brains out and waking up sick and hung-over,
you decided that you were sick and tired of being sick and tired. You decided
to quit drinking. You also decided to go to some A.A. meetings.
You went to A.A. to see if they had any helpful information
or techniques that would help you to quit drinking.
<p>
You were impressed by a skilled propagandist who made you one
of his proteg&eacute;s.
He told you to do a bunch of cultish busy-work, to immerse yourself in the cult,
and to also not drink alcohol.
He could have just told you not to drink any more alcohol and you would have been
just as sober.
<p>
You abstained from drinking alcohol because you chose to.
<p>
You gradually abandoned the cult practices because you realized that they
were not really necessary; that they were just a waste of time.
</font>
<p>

Do not mistake my cessation of attending church meetings as a turning
away from God. Neither mistake my cessation of attending A.A. meetings
as a turning away from their program. The Big Book led me to the Good
Book, and the Good Book has led me into a new way of life. I have been
born again, I am a new creation in God.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

There is great hypocrisy in both A.A. and the church, but I do not make
an effort to degrade and belittle that which does many people great good
&#8212; as it did for me. There is nothing perfect in this world and from what
I read in the Bible, Christ did not call us to go around pointing
fingers. Jesus was known as the &quot;friend of sinners,&quot; not the accuser of
sinners. Our &quot;commission&quot; if you will, is to share the GOOD NEWS of
Christ, and to be salt and light.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well A.A. sure doesn't do that. I can't remember the last time I heard people talking
about Jesus Christ in an A.A. meeting.
</font>
<p>

I see that you have put in a lot of time and have spent a lot of energy
toward disparaging an organization that has helped many people come to
Christ and be healed. I do not know what happened to cause such
bitterness in your heart, but I do know it does not come from God's
Spirit of Holiness, simply by the &quot;fruit&quot; that comes from your action.
It does not reflect that which is Christ &#8212; that which he exemplified
while he was here on earth. It does not line up with the whole of his
teachings. Instead, it casts a shadow of darkness and of doubt as to
your entire motive for taking such a stand.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but you are way over-generalizing. A.A. is not an organization that
&quot;has helped many people come to Christ and be healed.&quot;
What the Steppers tell me is that religion is a drag,
<a href="orange-letters9.html#religion_shackle">a shackle</a>,
and bad, and that
religious people are just hypocrits, etc.
If you talk about Jesus someone will suggest that you take it to church.
Or, as one A.A. member so eloquently said to me,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;<a href="orange-heresy.html#no_Jesus">You are in the wrong group
if you are looking for Jesus. &nbsp;

<p>

You hide behind a moniker that stand for death and destruction &#8212; Agent
Orange. You want to convince me that reflects Christ? The entire mood of
anger and hatred that your site exudes is totally unbecoming a follower
of Christ and belies any notion that you are walking and living in step
with God's Spirit of Holiness.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are grossly misreading the situation. The name &quot;Orange&quot; came from
a joke about mixing apples and oranges.
That morphed into another spoof, &quot;Secret Agent Orange&quot;, because I was anonymous.
That got shortened to just &quot;Agent Orange&quot;.
Sometimes Agent Orange hangs out with Agent Apple and Agent Banana.

I have answered that question many times before.

Please understand, I am not &quot;rebuking&quot; you. Rather, I am pleading with
you as a brother in Christ to step back and take a good look at what you
are doing and why, and see if it lines up with what God has called us
-/in Christ/- to be and do.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God or &quot;Higher Power&quot; or Great Spirit,
or whatever you want to call It, did not put me on this Earth to help a lying cult
to spread misinformation about God, recovery, and alcoholism.
</font>
<p>

Are we not to speak the truth in love and with gentleness? Are we not to
be humble at all times and to look up to others as being better than
ourselves?

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, not always. When Christ walked into the Temple, he flew into a rage when he
saw the money-changers desecrating the Temple, remember?

<p>
Jesus raged at them,
<font color="green">
&quot;It is written in the scriptures that God said,
<font color="#4f007f">
'My temple will be called a house of prayer for the people of all nations.'</font>
But you have made it into a hideout for thieves!&quot;
</font>
And then the whip came down.<br>
(Mark 11:15. Also see Matthew 21:12 and Luke 19:45.)
<p>
The idea that you must always be nice and meek and polite and namby-pamby
when confronting evil and wrong-doing is just another superstition. (Notice how it helps Evil.)
</font>
<p>

Please prayerfully consider the following portion from the letter of
James, and know that it is in love that I share my thoughts with you.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, for you know that we
who teach shall be judged with greater strictness. For we all make many
mistakes, and if any one makes no mistakes in what he says he is a
perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also. If we put bits into the
mouths of horses that they may obey us, we guide their whole bodies.
Look at the ships also; though they are so great and are driven by
strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will
of the pilot directs. So the tongue is a little member and boasts of
great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by a small fire!

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

And the tongue is a fire. The tongue is an unrighteous world among our
members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the cycle of nature,
and set on fire by hell. For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile
and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by humankind, but no
human being can tame the tongue?a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who are
made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and
cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so. Does a spring pour forth
from the same opening fresh water and brackish? Can a fig tree, my
brethren, yield olives, or a grapevine figs? No more can salt water
yield fresh.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good life let him show
his works in the meekness of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and
selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
This wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly,
unspiritual, devilish. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist,
there will be disorder and every vile practice. But the wisdom from
above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of
mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or insincerity. And the
harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
</font>
<p>
*James 3:1 through James 3:18 (RSV)*

<p>
<font color="blue">
Karl,
Why don't you ponder the question about &quot;What kind of a person
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">lies to sick people</a>
about what medicine might heal them and how well it works?&quot;
<p>
Is that spirituality?
<p>
Another question to ponder is, &quot;What kind of a person remains meek and silent
when he sees great evil being done?&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	AA &#8212; Stanton Peel<br>

<p>

Dear Mr. Orange,

<p>

I stumbled upon your site and was thoroughly impressed with the amount
of research that you have completed. I _am_ a member of NA, NOT AA as I
do not identify with the concept of being powerless over a substance.
Ironically I have come to many of the same conclusions that you have
arrived at. I now have 15 years of &quot;abstinence&quot; and attribute it to
myself, _not _ &quot;GOD&quot;.
<p>
I have concluded the following:

<p>
<ul>
<p><li> 
         I quit &quot;using&quot; when I made the decision &quot; I am _not_ powerless
over my recovery
<p><li> 
         NA is one of many, many ways to get &quot;recovery&quot; I have chosen
this one
<p><li> 
         I choose of my own free will to attend meetings &quot; not out of
fear or ignorance
<p><li> 
         I &quot;give back&quot; to other organisations in the community, as well
as NA
<p><li> 
         I only &quot;share&quot; in meetings when I want to and I don&quot;t always
want to
<p><li> 
         My &quot;personal statistic&quot; is attributed to me and nothing or no
one else =100% Me!
<p><li> 
         I don&quot;t think the &quot;statistics&quot; are right either&quot;NA has never
produced Stats&quot; = 100% succsess!
<p><li> 
         I believe that those who wish to stop &quot;using&quot; will stay
stopped regardless
<p><li> 
         NA states that addiction is a disorder: &quot;An ailment that
affects the function of mind or body&quot; that works for what I&quot;ve
experienced and seen &quot; NOT a &quot;disease&quot;
<p><li> 
         NA Members that work in the field of &quot;recovery&quot; should never
recommend one form of recovery option over the other&quot;&quot;no opinion on
outside issues&quot;
<p><li> 
         My beliefs are mine and are not necessarily applicable to
anyone else
<p><li> 
         So called &quot;defects &amp; assets&quot; are simply a matter of perception
<p><li> 
         NA states that addiction is NOT a moral issue &quot; that works for me
<p><li> 
         I consider myself an atheist and don&quot;t give a damn what GOD
thinks about it
<p><li> 
         I read Rational Recovery&quot;s The Small Book @ 11 years clean&quot;I
found I had intuitively developed about 60% of the same techniques
<p><li> 
         Stanton Peel has several good points about addiction and
recovery and i enjoy his books
<p><li> 
         I enjoy  discussion and am not afraid of or offended by
opposing views&quot;I believe in an open exchange of opinions and beliefs and
am open to changing my views if a new idea makes sense if it can
withstand critical and practical rigour

</ul>

<p>

Yeah, &quot;OL Bill W was a crackpot. He dropped acid (LSD) from 1956 to 58.
(Pass it On, AA World Service Publication) But as you have made the
point of quoting Adolph Hitler (Methamphetamine addict)
Even the truly cuckoo can have their moments&quot;

<p>

It may be strange to you that I agree with many of your findings&quot;I guess
I went to NA (NOT AA) with my own opinions and critical thinking and
have made it work for me and not vice versa.
Thanks again for your hard work; I respect the extent of your thoroughness.

<p>

Sincerely<br>
Jim H.

Subject:  	A new leash on life!<br>

<p>

Hello Orange,
<p>
I'm thinking of all the creatures great and small who bear the brunt of
their dependent house mates: the pets! Why has nobody come up with a
twelve step solution for Fido and Fluffy? They have been abused and
humiliated and they need some kind of recovery program and an HP
(Higher Pet). Pets have been taught to fetch beer from the fridge and
sometimes are cheered on as they slobber up a spill. Co-dependency is a
major issue, especially among our canine friends, and dysfunctional
litters are not an exception but the norm in this country ravaged by
disease. Is there something wrong with me or is there a real need for
Alapet groups?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Pet Owner,
<p>
You are absolutely right. In addition, the pooches need to learn how to
hold tin cans, and how to sign over the deeds to their dog-houses,
so that they can be audited by the Scientologists and get rid of those
painful engrams.
<p>
Have a good day.

*Hi Agent,*
<p>
*  I was just wondering what opinion you would have about the James
Frey  controversy.*
<p>
*  Personally I have totally enjoyed reading your informative website,
thou I am only 1/3 thru your site.  Thou I have always felt something
lacking in AA, I do attend some meetings for the same reasons you give
about what is good  in AA. The fellowship and encouragement. I believe
strongly in the SMART approach to recovery. I didn't get sober and/or
clean to be a mindless cult member. *
<p>
*   Keep up the good work of getting the truth out to people!*
<p>
**<br>
*Respectfully,*
**<br>
*Ray C.*

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Ray,
<p>
Thanks for the question. I still have not yet read Frey's book, but I've been
hearing plenty about it. It seems that there are two separate issues
there, and they are getting all mixed up.
<p>
1. Frey fabricated some tall tales to make his book more exciting and saleable.
Apparently, he actually first tried to sell it as a work of fiction,
but his publisher wanted it to be a true story, because those apparently sell
better, so the fiction became &quot;a true story&quot;.
<p>
That is unfortunate, and even reprehensible, because a lot of people were putting
a lot of emotional stock in his story of recovery without the 12-step cult, and
they were left feeling betrayed.
<p>
2. I hear that Frey had some strong criticisms of the 12-Step treatment programs,
and 12-Step &quot;recovery&quot;. Not having read his book, I can't agree or disagree. I just
notice that the people who are pro-12-steps are trying to imply that the cricisms
of A.A. or N.A. are just as untrue as his stories of fights with the cops and
arrests and imprisonment.
<p>
That is bad logic, even though Frey's credibility is blown.
They remain two separate issues.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;joe m.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	regarding aa<br>

<p>

I read with great relish you position paper on AA cultism. While i do
agree that there are many cultish behaviors with in AA,such as the
closing prayer and handholding routines,which i am not a fan of.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Joe,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Actually, I find that the closing prayer and the hand-holding are some of the
least-objectionable cult characteristics of Alcoholics Anonymous. What bothers me
are the much more obnoxious things like
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting">deceptive recruiting</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality">irrational dogma</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_dishonesty">dishonesty</a>,
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_hypocrisy">hypocrisy</a>,
and about 60 more such items that you will find in
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>.
</font>
<p>



The
truth for me is that i could not stop drinking without the help and
support of my fellow members. It for me gave me a starting point to
belong. Finally there were people with the same desire to kill themselves
that i had. For me it was very powerful as i had not belonged any where
in school jails or even in my family. For a scared hopeless person like
myself it gave me comraderie and a sense of purpose.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay, so you enjoy the meetings, and get some comfort from them.
You found it to be a supportive social group.
<p>
That does not mean that A.A. meetings or the 12 Steps work
to make people quit drinking, or
that other people should be forced into Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
Surely we can put together some non-drinking social groups that are not cults.
</font>
<p>


Having been very
aware of cults growing up and having the ability to see through them: i
was heavily recruited by many. I did not believe AA was in truth a
cult. The proplem Mr.Orange is that the proof is in the pudding.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, the proof is in the pudding, and A.A. is a failure.
You should read the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">The Effectiveness of the 12-Step Treatment</a>
to see what the pudding is.

</font>
<p>



 It does
not matter what Mr. Wilsons shortcomings were I am sure he was very well
aware of them if memory serves me correctly.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Um, when a bunch of people declare that some guy is a messenger from God, it matters.
And
<a href="orange-letters34.html#messenger">I get a lot of letters from the A.A. true believers</a>
that tell me that Bill Wilson
was a messenger from God.
<p>
No he wasn't. He was a lying con artist.
</font>
<p>


You fail to include the book
that actually gave him the impetus? to begin writing.This book was
&quot;Varieties of Religious Experiences&quot; .This book provided the wiggle room
that Mr.Wilson needed to keep him from reverting to his childhood
religion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, the book by William James, &quot;Varieties of Religious Experiences&quot;,
had
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#CJung">almost no input into Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
All that Bill Wilson did was take
a branch of Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult and make it his own. A.A. is the Oxford
Group, and A.A. is Buchmanism. Bill Wilson didn't make up the theology of
Alcoholics Anonymous at all.

<p>
The only line from James's book that made it into the Alcoholics Anonymous dogma is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
'&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot;
is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical man.'</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson mistakenly attributed that quote to Carl Jung, but it really
came from footnote 1 on page 263 of <i>Varieties</i>. So William James
got one line into the A.A. doctrines, and Carl Jung got zero.
Everything else came from Frank Buchman.
</font>
<p>

I have the good fortune to have been sober 26 years with
varying degrees of &quot;sobriety&quot;.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Congratulations on your sobriety.
</font>
<p>

Unfortunatly Mr. Wilson had to live his
latter years without the benefit of medications for his depression.I do
believe he thought they would help him but he felt the world was
watching him.
In essence he was a martyr for AA to the detriment of his
health.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh good grief. Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">stole all of the money</a>,
and made himself the Chief Boohoo of the Cult, and was
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">a sexual predator</a>
who used his leadership position
to seduce women A.A. members, and he lied constantly.
He was not a &quot;martyr&quot;.
<p>
Bill Wilson suffered from years-long bouts of
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#depressive_disorder">deep clinical depression</a>
as well as a
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic">narcissistic personality disorder</a>
since childhood.
His pain was not caused by &quot;service to A.A.&quot; or anything like that.
</font>
<p>

I do not always go to meetings in fact for 10 years I attended
none.That may have provided me with a fresh perspective on cultism.On
the other hand there is no such powerful force as a group coming
together in a common cause when they each have an affliction it has
proved helpful in all phases of medicne.And if people take the time to
meditate every day,i think the world at large could use the same.I like
you do not believe that God is my personal servant .It is up to me to
find my way in this world.I will say however that the times I have tried
to listen very hard in this world and relied on intuition from the
result of meditating I have been amazed at what I have seen and
heard.Something very special seems to happen when you try to be in tune
rather than bulldozing.I of course do not always rely on this as iI am
just an ordinary human.
<p>
<font color="blue">
I agree that meditation can be a very good thing. But that does not make
Bill Wilson a very good thing.
</font>
<p>


I think you may be just a little too harsh on AA
as awhole.What your motivation is I have no idea,I too have heard horror
stories of rigidisets telling members to not take any meds. I myself
take some as it is helpful but I would dare not tell anyone else to stop
and will even confront other members that do advise such behavior.The
one thing about AA is the fact that the door to get in is very broad so
I suspect even you could get a seat if the need ever arises.
<p>
Please note
that not all members are as rigid and conforming as you may believe. I
am still a Deadhead after all this time though I do not smoke ,I am also
looking for LsD therapy as an insight into my psyche.Bill wilson thought
it would do wonders but again the world was watching.I on the other hand
am small potatos.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I know that not all A.A. members are narrow-minded and dogmatic. But as a whole,
the organization is still doing more harm than good.
<p>
Bill Wilson did plenty of research into LSD, regardless of who was watching.

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;One of the founders of Alcoholics Anonymous [Bill Wilson]
described to me the transcendental experience he credits
with giving him control over his compulsive drinking.
Years later he took LSD five or six times. This, he
said, reinstated his original ecstasy, and consequently
he wishes that LSD were more available to alcoholics.&quot;<br>

<font size="-1">
<i>Chemical Ecstasy: Psychedelic Drugs and Religion</i>, Walter Houston Clark,
page 101. Sheed &amp; Ward, New York, 1969.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And Bill actually took LSD a lot more than 5 times.
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#loved_LSD">He took it heavily for at least 3 years</a>,
and turned on everybody around him that he could talk into trying it, including his wife,
his priest, his secretary, and other A.A. members.

<p>
I wish you well in your chemical search for happiness, but personally, I'm retired from that scene.
I'm working on a different wavelength now.
<p>
If you are really trying to treat or cure depression with LSD, I strongly recommend
that you see a doctor and get some medications that are more appropriate for your condition.
LSD tends to make bipolar people worse off. Be careful. See a doctor.
</font>
<p>

So in conclusion save some of your vehemence for a
crowd that is much more deserving ,with your investigative powers I
suspect you could find someone.If on the other hand you ever need a
reasonably humble man with all the same disorders as Bill Wilson minus
some i say some grandiosity please feel free to call on me. My favorite
to do a story on is the groups that use the handicapped to raise
money,like the YMCA and I happen to know that the money raised goes to
general funds and not exclusivly to the handicapped program.I also know
of a wealthy public riding club that touts their Pegasus Program as the
reason they are raising money,even trotting out the handicapped kids no
less and the money raised goes of course into general funds.This is a
nationwide epidemic that I feel is worthy of your attentions and
writings as you are certainally dogged .

Okay, Joseph, you are quoted.

I have occasionally branched out into criticizing other aspects of the so-called
&quot;recovery industry&quot;, like my web page on
&quot;<a href="orange-gulags.html">Children's Gulags</a>&quot;, because abusing
children in &quot;rehabilitation camps&quot; is a product of the same mind-set as says
that we should shove alcoholics into the 12-Step cult for their own good.
<p>
But the main focus of this web site will remain Alcoholics Anonymous and the
other branches of the 12-Step empire.

Dear Mr. A:

<p>
I am a medical physician with an open mind. I am both a scientist and
a believer in the human spirit, whatever it may be called: intuition;
wisdom; education (both academic and hard knocks schools);conscience.
I have read your writings. I do not agree with all you say but will
defend your right to say it (see Voltaire: &quot;Not only is it extremely
cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we
do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their
eternal damnation.&quot;)
<p>
I just wonder how badly you must have been hurt to be obsessed with all
of this AA stuff.

<p>

By the way, thank you for your research, in that you have provided me
with many documents and pictures I had searched for.
Remember rule 62

<p>

May the god of your undertanding bless you with tolerance and a new
freedom and new happiness.

it sounds to me that your in denial. it's not a shamelful thing to be an
addict or alcoholic and no matter what you think or say, you will be one
for the rest of your life, the problem doesn't just go away. as for
sponsors, their are bad ones out there but that doesn't mean you need to
quit going to meetings just cuz you had trouble with yours. there's
millions of meetings all around and different people. I would have to
agree with you sponsor that you haven't hit you bottom yet. I&quot;m not
trying to bash on you but I am an addict and I had the same mentality as
you have and I've seen many others with the same attidue. I went back
out for awhile and it really sucked but your higher power has a plan for
you, and right now it might not be recovery. I respect your opinions but
don't forget where you came from and where you could end up.

Hi Brderchick,
<p>
In denial? You know, there is a strong echo in here.
Again and again, it's either
&quot;<a href="orange-letters26.html#resentment">you have a resentment</a>&quot;,
or &quot;you are in denial&quot;.

<p>
If you would just read
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction</a>
to this web site, just the very first small page,
you would read my story of alcoholism. I am not in denial and haven't
been since I went into DT's while quitting drinking 17 years ago.

<p>
As far as the rest of your rap goes, I am not in danger of relapse because I don't
believe in the 12-Step dogma. Heck, I would be in far greater danger if I did believe
in it.
<p>
Oh, and I don't have a sponsor, and the sponsor that I don't have didn't say that I
haven't hit bottom yet, etc... etc...
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>

to be quite honest, i think you full of shit. No person who is truly an
addict or alcholic would be just fine on their own. Addiction fucks you
and you don't just &quot;snap out of it&quot;. Your research isn't correct, I
think you should check again. If you really knew people in a twelve step
program, you would know it saves a lot of lives, maybe not everyones but
people who are willing to have an openmind. As for a religious cult..if
you know so much about the literature, you should have read a lot of
spirituality...not religion....religion is for people who fear hell,
spirituality are for people who have already been there. I'm not sure if
you have nothing else to do, but being an asshole over the internet
seems like a waste of time to me. People always have to get into shit
they know nothing about or disagree with, why not do something you enjoy
or  your interested in? Whats the point of all this? To see how many
compliments you can get? To see how many people you can get pissed off?
Seems ridiculous. I'm sure your going to refer me to some page of your
site or tell me i'm in denial, but life is precious and your wasting
your time.

<p>

God bless

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Brderchick,
<p>
Yep, you're right. I'm going to say that you're in denial.
That's the ultimate in denial &#8212;
just stubbornly insist that recovery from addictions is not possible.
(Notice how that conveniently explains A.A.'s failure to cure alcoholics.)

<p>
It is, of course, absurd to declare that people must be slaves for the rest of their
lives just because they got habituated to some chemical for a while. A slave to addictions,
or a slave to a recovery cult, or a slave to &quot;god&quot; or
&quot;Higher Power&quot;... Always a slave to something.
<p>
Well I'm not buying it. This world is not a fascist heaven where
everybody has to be a slave of somebody or something, some addiction or cult
or F&uuml;hrer or other.

<p>
What, are you afraid to discover that the door to your cage was always unlocked?
<p>

All of those years that you spent in that cage, insisting that you could never get out of it,
and the door was always unlocked.
<p>
Ooops.

<p><br>
Recovery from addictions is most assuredly possible.
People do it every day. Millions of people recover and go do something
else with their lives.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School
reported</a> that a little over half
of all alcoholics eventually quit drinking, and 80% of those successful quitters
do it alone, on their own.
They do just snap out of it, and decide that they won't die that way.

<p>
That is actually a very cheerful and encouraging message. You can recover. You
can get it together and live your own life more the way that you desire.
You can use your own native intelligence and common sense to solve your problems.
Like the Jefferson Airplane sang, &quot;You've got to take your head in your hands and
make your own demands or you'll wind up crystallizing on a shelf.&quot;


<p><br>
And no, the 12-Step program does not save a lot of lives. You are just trying to
claim the credit for those few people who decided to quit drinking, for whatever reason,
and then who happened to spend some time in an A.A. meeting room &#8212; often <i>after</i>
they have already quit drinking.
(And yes, I'm going to refer you to another page. Check out the actual A.A. success rate
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">here</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts">here</a>.)

<p><br>
As far as &quot;spirituality&quot; goes, you are just throwing that same
tired old slogan at me,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;religion is for people who fear hell,
spirituality are for people who have already been there&quot;</font>, 
which makes you oh so much more spiritual than the people who go to the regular
churches. Baloney. That is just an ego game of spiritual one-upmanship, not spiritual
at all.
Now you are showing that A.A. really is a cult religion.
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_cult_special">We are special</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_denigrate_others">
We are better than the other religions</a>.&quot;</i>
<p><br>
The answer to your last question of &quot;why?&quot; is simple.
<a href="orange-intro.html">I saw friends getting fed quack medicine and cult religion</a>
instead of anything that
even vaguely resembled &quot;treatment&quot; for addictions, and saw that the whole recovery
industry is a hoax and a fraud, and Alcoholics Anonymous is at the heart of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie">the big lie</a>.
The goal is to save lives by telling people the truth, no matter whether you are
comfortable with the truth or not.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange

<p>

My friend gave me the name of your site and as an AA member who was
involved in running a Secular Recovery meeting for some time in the
UK I was interested as you express a lot of views that I've held
about 12 Step recovery for a while. What's with the zealotry, though?
Aren't you driven by the same need-to-prove &#8212; the need to disprove,
in this case &#8212; stuff that you highlight as being messed-up in the AA
literature and in many members' attitudes? It's good to have a forum
for this stuff but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater: good,
healing stuff goes on in AA... and then there's all the crap in AA
that you've shown so well on your site. Alcoholism is a complex issue
and alcoholics are not an homogenous group so you can't be so
definitive about what's right and wrong for people in terms of how
they stop drinking. One of the problems is that there have been so
few proper scientific studies into AA for anybody to be sure about
things one way or the other.

<p>

Keep up the good work (but try and be more balanced)!

<p>

Regards <br>
Paul

Hi Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments.

The thing that makes me a &quot;zealot&quot; is reading the faked
&quot;studies&quot; that are generated by the A.A. propaganda mill to justify
forcing the 12-step garbage on more people, and diverting more medical
care money to the 12-Step cult.
If you think that I am prolific or productive, you should look at their
output.

and their ilk.
My output is nothing compared to theirs.
<p>
I disagree with your attempt at an
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">escape via relativism</a>
&#8212; that we don't know anything for sure because
there haven't been enough valid studies
to know anything. Read the file on

Hi Joe,

In going down my list of credentials, I was stunned to notice that I have the
same qualifications as Bill Wilson in every category:

<ol>
<p><li> I am not a doctor, psychologist, psychiatrist, or a counselor.

<p><li> I am an old alcoholic with lots of years of experience in drinking. Like Bill Wilson,
I drank until I was showing
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#brain_damage">signs of brain damage</a>.

<p><li> I also took psychedelic drugs and had
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna">drug-induced religious
and spiritual experiences</a>.

<p><li> I don't have a GED. I don't need one; I graduated from high school.

<p><li> Like Bill Wilson, I dropped out of college.

<p><li> Unlike Bill Wilson, I scored high in math and science classes.

<p><li> Like Bill Wilson, I am self-trained.

<p><li> And lastly, yes I have a God.

</ol>
<p>
I am in every way just as qualified as Bill Wilson to set up a cult religion
and start counseling alcoholics in how to use occult nonsense to recover
from addictions.

No, the medical studies I cite are most assuredly not detached statistics &#8212; also

Hi Orange

<p>

I was recently at an AA meeting and sharing my experience, strength and
hope and mentioned that AA never got me sober &lt; I've been sober for over
20 years &gt;. Anyway, a woman shared after me and said that she was
confused &lt; sober 8 months &gt; that I didn't give AA credit for my
recovery. Recovery for me has meant going back to the chamber of horrors
&lt; my childhood &gt; and rescuing that little boy who was so horrifically
abused and feel the terror, pain, anger and guilt which had been locked
in my body all those years.

<p>

Anyway, the guy that shared after this woman started abusing me, saying
I was anti AA and that he hated me. I told him that he probably hated
himself and that I imagined he was quite mad, but wasn't aware of it.
All the people that shared, after him, were quite adamant about how AA
had helped them and made sure that what I had shared was inappropriate &lt;
covert &gt; and basically, I was wrong. The amazing thing was that I had
been sober the longest.

<p>

Here I am sharing with these people &lt; how I got to AA and ended up
having to see a therapist to deal with my feelings &gt; that I have
recovered from alcoholism and owed my recovery to Jesus Christ, not AA.

<p>

No one in the meeting mentioned how they felt, &lt; if you have strong
feelings, you better get to more meetings and stuff them down &gt; they
read something out of the Big Book, and then discussed what they read,
very much like being at school, very controlling.

<p>

I imagine, that some of the people in that particular meeting could be
quite dangerous, like that guy raging at me and making me wrong. I
imagine, if people are not dealing with their core issues &lt;feelings &gt;
they drink, commit suicide, or act out their rage in other addictions.
I'm not anti AA, if anything; AA has helped me deal with my own issues.
I imagine, AA to be one giant dysfunctional family, and probably would
have never have recovered, without it. I am grateful to AA, but I feel,
that I need to move on. I won't be going back, because I imagine the
people don't want what I have; being happy, joyous and free and a
recovered alcoholic.

Hi David,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the story.
<p>
Again, we see the problem that in A.A., people with little or no training,
education, or experience prop themselves up as real authorities on recovery,
and feel entitled to shove their opinions on others.
(Heck, you don't even have to be sane to be a sponsor.)
Yes, it is dangerous.
It even drives people to suicide.
<p>
Hopefully, in the future there will be more non-cult sobriety clubs
to help people get sober.
<p>
Oh well, have a happy life and a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Danny R.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Say What?<br>

<p>

I just finished reading the entire page of your site, &quot;It's Spiritual,
Not Religious&quot;.  (http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-spirrel.html)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Danny,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
That page is obsolete. The current version is at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005146/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-spirrel.html">
http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-spirrel.html</a>

</font>
<p>

With all due respect, it is apparent that you chose to publish this page
not only with your own bias, but also many deceptive and non-contextual
quotes from literature published in support of several 12 step programs.
Was this all in the intent to undermine these programs?
<p>
<font color="blue">
It is all the same 12-Step cult, with the same 12 Steps and the same heretical
theology, no matter whether they are claiming to cure alcoholism, drug addiction,
compulsive gambling, sex addiction, or spiritual cooties like
'<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#codependency">codependency</a>'.
And they all yammer,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It's spiritual, not religious.&quot;
</font>
</font>

<p>
I can
understand your points made in establishing whether or not AA, NA, et al
should be considered a church, but when you tried to prove your point by
the comparisons of the 12 step programs to many conventional and
accepted organized religions, you destroyed your own arguments.  You
practiced the very double-speak that you ridicule in the article. The
fact that these types of programs /encourage/ participants to do certain
things such as making a moral inventory and becoming willing to make
amends while 'religions' do not in itself shows that these programs are
not religious.

<p>
<font color="blue">
What double-speak? Please be specific.
Show exact quotes.
<p>
Comparing Alcoholics Anonymous to
other religions is a very good way to show that A.A. is a religion.
In fact, it shows that A.A. is far more extreme than those other religions.
</font>
<p>

I was so confused by what you were really trying to accomplish.  I
respect your right to opinionated writing.  However, I found your site
after doing an internet search for 'Bible &amp; Narcotics Anonymous' in an
effort to find biblical support of the program.  Reading your site could
discourage a person such as me from seeking recovery from addiction.
The way that you presented your information could lead a person to
believe that there is absolutely no hope through such programs /nor/
through religion.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, my web site will not discourage people from seeking recovery from addiction.
It will merely discourage people from getting fooled by cults that claim to
offer recovery.
</font>
<p>

By no means do I feel that 12 step programs are perfect.  However,
neither is any established religion.  AA, NA, CA, OA, the Baptist
church, the Roman Catholic church, and the Buddhist culture are all
based upon the thoughts and collaborations of human beings.  All of them
are subject to bias, preference, interpretation and corruption.  For
each person to succeed in life, they must find a system or program that
allows them to better themselves and allows for service to fellow
human-kind.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is an attempt to use the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">escape via relativism</a>&quot;.
--
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Oh heck, A.A. isn't any worse than other religions.&quot;</i>
</font>
<p>
That is also a good example of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>,
something that A.A. says alcoholics do a lot.
</font>
<p>

What was your intent, other than discouraging readers from
self-improvement and enlightenment?  Would you rather see your fellow
humans live in a life of suffrage and misery?

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is two more propaganda tricks.
You try to frame the question as:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;EITHER join the 12-Step cults, OR ELSE live a life of suffering and misery.&quot;</i></font>
<p>
That's
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#frame_argument">framing the argument</a>,
and use of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or">the EITHER/OR propaganda technique</a>.
<p>
Life is not a matter of &quot;join a cult&quot; or else you will live in misery.<br>
Self-improvement and enlightenment are not achieved by parrotting the slogans of a cult.

<p>
My intention is to warn people
about the dishonesty and crazyness of 12-Step recovery cults.
I am all for people breaking free of addictions, and free of cults too.
</font>
<p>

I don't expect a response.  I don't expect my opinion to change yours.
Regardless of your path in life, I hope for you the best rather than
what you deserve.  I hope the same for myself.

<p>

Thank you for your article.  It did serve to encourage me in my own
faith and spirituality.  Thank you for your time in reading this e-mail.
By the way, I am a Christian and participate in the traditions and
theology of the Baptist church.  I am also an addict in recovery through
the process of the Narcotics Anonymous 12 Step Program.  I have combined
the teachings of both to improve myself as a part of this society we
call Earth.  And, having had a spiritual awakening?I try to practice
these principles in all my affairs.

<p>
<font color="blue">
If you are really a Christian, then you should read the web page on
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>.

The 12-Step cult is not a Christian religion, no matter how somebody tries
to twist and reinterpret the words.

Subject:  	RE: Say What?<br>

<p>

I appreciate you taking time to reply.  I must admit to you that my
first e-mail was written in retaliatory anger.  After further research
of your pages, which of course took more than a few minutes, I must
commend you for being bold enough to express your opinions in such an
open format.  I respect your writings and often found great humor among
the pages.  This does not mean that I totally agree with all of them.  I
have since reconsidered where my disgust should have been directed and
wish to retract it from you and your pages.  I thank God that we live in
a country where you and I are both free to express our opinions and
practice religion and spirituality as we feel.

<p>

Good fortune to you in the future and may the God of your understanding
continue to bless you.

<p>

Thanks,<br>
Danny

Dear Agent Orange,

<p>

I have been

by your expos&eacute; for a couple of years now.
I even believe that I wrote to you once before.
After learning about your problem with AOL I decided to write once again.
I laud your candor and I hope you will continue your efforts at
debunking this unfortunate lie.  If you could put me on your mailing
list for new information I would very much appreciate it.

<p>

Your Sincerely,<br>

Hi Sam,

Thanks for all of the compliments.
Right now, there isn't any mailing list. I suppose that's another thing to think
about, but I don't know what I would mail...
