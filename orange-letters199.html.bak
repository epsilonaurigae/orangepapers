Subject:  	Something for you<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I have been following you for years, and I wanted to thank you for helping me leave
AA. I was a member for nearly 25 years,

<p>
I know that you collect information about AA, but do you know about the Big Book
Experience&quot; or the &quot;Big Book Awakening?&quot;

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005122/http://www.bigbookexperience.org/" target="_blank">
http://www.bigbookexperience.org</a>

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005122/http://www.bigbookawakening.com/" target="_blank">
http://www.bigbookawakening.com/</a>

<p>
My sponsor became involved with it about 10 years ago, and insisted that I &quot;have the
experience&quot; by paying money and showing up in a room to fill out the forms. She told
me it was a &quot;Big Book Study&quot; and invited me to eat lunch with her and one of the men
she knew from the &quot;Awakening.&quot;

<p>
I had lived in San Francisco in the 1970s, and knew several people who had been
involved with est, the Krishnas, IRC, etc.. I immediately picked up on the insider
jargon that I had heard from them and thought &quot;CULT.&quot;

<p>
The gist of these studies is treating the book as if it is a sacred text, and tying
back to Biblical passages. People who have done it refer to it as &quot;The Work&quot; and
assume that they are insiders. They talk (constantly) about how much better AA was
in the 1930s and how the AA GSO has ruined the &quot;Big Book.&quot; They are specially chosen
for this &quot;work&quot; and normal AA members are just sick.

<p>
It would be worth your while to get the Awakening book and read the questions. It is
being used now in AA to treat everything from &quot;hard cases&quot; to &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; to
&quot;anxiety&quot;.

<p>
By the way, if that is you on Facebook, I befriended you,

<p>
Lisa.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Lisa,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and the information. I didn't know about that, but will happily check
it out and collect all of the information that I can.
<p>
I find using cult religion to treat bipolar disorder and anxiety to be really appalling quackery.
That is as bad as the previous one that I just learned about:
<a href="orange-letters195.html#depression12" target="_blank">outpatient 12 step treatment for depression.</a>.
Why aren't those creeps being prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license, and put in prison?
When a black kid with a gun steals $500 from the corner store, he gets 5 years in prison.
But when a white cult member steals $20,000 by selling cult religion as medical treatment, he gets more
health insurance money. This has to change.

<p>
And yes, that is me on Facebook, &quot;Orange Papers&quot;.
So we are now FB friends.
<p>
Have a good day.

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I haven't emailed you for a while but saw this section of the www.aa.org
website and was astounded at the blatant smoothing over of facts
regarding AAs beginnings.

<p>
<b>&quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005122/http://aa.org/aatimeline/" target="_blank">http://aa.org/aatimeline/</a> &gt; origins&quot;</b>
 talks about Bill W being a &quot;golden
boy&quot; on Wall St who suddenly underwent a powerful spiritual experience
and whose depression &amp; despair was lifted &#8212; (implied permanently)

<p>
YAY !!!! ..........NOT... Amazing that there was no mention of the real
details of Bill W's &quot;career&quot; (Let alone the small matter of committing
Securities Fraud), no mention of the powerful spiritual experience being
a result of some hardcore hallucinogenic drugs and no mention of his
ongoing chronic depression for years in &quot;recovery&quot;.

<p>
Hmmmm, it's almost like they don't want people to know the truth &#8212; 
especially when most AA people who will try to recreate said &quot;spiritual
experience&quot; do it without the benefit of hallucinogenic drugs, and then
feel like they failed.

<p>
Cheers

Hello Michael,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Yes, you hit the nail on the head. They don't want people to know the truth.
They are selling a fairy tale, a work of fiction. That is standard cult behavior &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_dishonesty" target="_blank">rewriting history</a>,
reversal of reality,
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#ca_guru_special" target="_blank">glorification of the founder</a>.

That is why Alcoholics Anonymous is a cult religion, not a real treatment for a real disease.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	RE: Peter Braunstein<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
I was reading your site earlier, and just realized that you had published
<a href="orange-letters189.html#Anthony" target="_blank">my second letter to you</a>
also.  Thanks again for doing so, and thanks for your comments.

<p>
Yes, I can send you the pamphlet 'AA Guidelines, Cooperating with Court, DWI, and
Similar Programs'.  I'm sure you'll find it interesting.  It strongly relates to the
information on your site about how the courts and legal system work closely with
AA.  I picked it from one of the local AA 'Clubhouses', close to where my parents
live, where they have all sorts of stuff like this.    I don't have a scanner, but
my father has one at his house, but not sure if it works...it not, I can go to
Kinko's.  I can also mail you a copy via regular mail if your mailing address is on
the site or if you send it to me.

<p>
Regarding Peter Braunstein, you can find plenty of information on him online,
including newspaper articles, television shows, jailhouse interviews etc...just no
references to his long term attendance in various 12-step meetings in Manhattan.  If
anyone mentioned this, I missed it.  I kind of knew him as an acquaintance just from
attending some of the same meetings (CA and Al-Anon) in the early to mid 90s, but
after I 'dropped out', I kind of lost touch with him until reading about the manhunt
going on for him in the NY Post (think that was 2007).  I'm actually surprised that
no one else contacted you or any of the news sources about this creature...if anyone
did,  they certainly never published his association with the fellowship, as  I have
mentioned.  You also mentioned in your first response to me that you had heard of
the media censoring any mention of nasty criminals attending AA, and this is only
one case that I know if since it was so high-profile, but I would imagine that this
happens regularly.  The pamphlet just sheds some more light into the nature of the
alliance between AA and the legal system, and how they sort of cover for each
other.'

<p>

<p>
Anthony

Subject:  	Good work<br>

<p>
Thankfully your site exists or I would have had to start one up like it years ago,
you have saved me years of work. I drank harder than almost anyone out there but now
my life is so far removed from alcohol I spend almost no time at all ever thinking
about it one bit. From time to time I check your site to check the progress of 12
step alternatives to make sure progress is being made on that front but it's still
not enough. I wish I could go battle on the front lines, like I have for years,
against quacks of all sorts in the medical field who just won't stop with their
pushing the AA poison on people but about a year ago I just walked away after never
get anywhere with it. It is truly infuriating trying to talk sense to people who
won't listen, who believe themselves to be objective scientists. It is hard to
believe that these deaf, blind, and stupid fools gotten as far as they have in life,
but look at the world. My gripe is having watched many friends go down as victims of
the 12 step poison and dance of brainless death. I too went through it and made
mincemeat out of those jerks &#8212; I have nothing against the ignorant and vulnerable
&quot;newcomers&quot; but I do despise the sociopathic &quot;old timers&quot; and their deadly games.

<p>
I find it so amusing that all of the 12 step groups are shedding their supposedly
individual purposes, melding into 1 here in parts of SoCal, it totally exposes that
at the heart of the 12 steps we find The Cult of the Ones &#8212;
 Bill &quot;scumbag&quot; Wilson and
his demented, two-faced plan to rule the fools among us from his grave. Talk about a
monster that needs a stake driven in its heart!

<p>
Keep it up! I wish you had a hardcover book, I would buy an entire case.

<p>
Wow you really have some serious problems.

<p>
I've been in and out of AA most of my life, I learned allot while sober, yea its
not my favorite place to be but man are you way off base.

<p>
AA has allot of different people and allot of dipshits however it also has allot
of very good people and very successfull people along with those who where dying
on the streets.

<p>
You stated many untrue non valid claims against this program, I am currently not
attending AA so I feel justified to get into controversy with this.

<p>
You need to get your facts a little more straight, AA is completely volunteer
and its completely up to the individual to not get steered in the wrong
direction, thats totally on you if your stupid enough to let this happen which I
highly suspect is what happen to you, why else would you have such a hatred of
something that helps many people unless you had some other bad experience,
someone killing themself that you knew a Girl running off with someone, whatever
this is not AAs fault its individuals fault.

<p>
Your AA fail rate is based on what? And what do you consider fail, because
someone went and drank, Im drinking again but I live much better because of
things I learned in AA, I didn't fail because of AA I just simply wanted to
drink.

<p>
The thing people like you do is focus on people who go out and what you dont get
is how many of them come back and end up recovering and leading great lives.

<p>
AA would not be as large as it is if it didn't work, you need to get over it and
stop putting lies out there about something you know very little about.

<p>
How good will you feel if someone thats in trouble reads your bullshit and
looses all hope believing these crack pot statements you make and ends up dying
from some kind of overdose when he was just about to go to a meeting but came
accross your crap and dies when, if he made it to a meeting he would have met
that person that saves his life but instead dies because he listen to this
absolute crap you wrote.

<p>
Again I am not currently a member of AA I just see the reality on both sides, I
have my problems with going to meetings but thats exactly what they are my
problems not AA.

<p>
I suppose you think they should build a god damn mosque at ground zero too.

<p>
When theres something helping people in trouble how could someone be against it,
nothing perfect and AA is full of sick people trying to help each other, how the
hell can you put that down?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
Starting at the top, where you actually tried to make some points, rather than just
declare that I'm insane:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
First off, A.A. is supposed to be a safe place for people to come and recover.
People are supposed to be able to trust their sponsors and the oldtimers to not steer them wrong.
You are saying that this is not so and it is the responsibility of the individual
newcomer to watch out for his own welfare &#8212; when he is newly detoxed and cloud-headed
and vulnerable and in need of real help.
<p>
How is a freshly-detoxed, confused, disoriented newcomer supposed to defend 
himself or  herself from the predations of an unscrupulous sponsor?
How is that newcomer supposed to know whether the oldtimer is giving good advice or lying?

<p>
A.A. is most emphatically <i>not</i> &quot;completely volunteer&quot;. That is obviously
untrue.
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">People are routinely sentenced to
A.A.</a>
And 93% of the treatment centers in this country sell 12-Step religion as a quack cure
for alcohol abuse and drug addiction, and that attendance is not voluntary either.

<p>
And then you can't understand why someone would criticize a quack medicine fraud that
harms people? Quack medicine that kills more people than it helps?
You think it must have something to do with a girl running off with someone?

<p><li>

<p>
The A.A. failure rate is based on everything in the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
There is a large amount of evidence that A.A. is a failure, ranging from the
doctors' tests of A.A., to A.A.'s own literature declaring the A.A. failure and dropout
rates, to indirect indicators like the declining numbers of sobriety coins given out.
<p>
So you are drinking again, but you consider yourself a success?  A.A. does not. 
Do you go to A.A. meetings and proudly declare that you have zero weeks of sobriety
and that the A.A. teachings are helping you to drink?
If not, then how do you credit A.A. with improving your life?
How do the A.A. teachings help you to drink successfully?
A.A. says that you <i>cannot</i> drink moderately.

Spoken like a true Stepper. You are still a true believer member of the cult,

There is zero evidence that going to a 12-Step meeting will keep addicts from overdosing.
Many doctors have found that Alcoholics Anonymous makes things worse:

<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">Drs. Orford and Edwards</a>,

So, you are really just an angry hateful religious bigot, aren't you?
Just like the terrorists.
And you sound like a Tea Party nutcase, too.
Why don't you do something about that &quot;resentment&quot; of yours?
Didn't A.A. and Bill Wilson teach you that you are
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#axiomatically" target="_blank">axiomatically spiritually
wrong to have a resentment</a>?
<p>
For your information, the &quot;mosque at ground zero&quot; is not at Ground Zero. It's several blocks away.
That is just a fake issue, a red herring that some trouble-makers made up.
In addition, the &quot;mosque&quot; is really a community center that just includes a mosque on the
second floor. Furthermore, the people organizing the thing are Sufis. The Sufis are the most
peaceful, tolerant, open-minded sect of Islam that there is. I know, I've hung out with them
and gone to their religious services. They had the symbols of all of the religions of the world
on the walls around the room, and we did prayers and chants from all of the world's religions during the
service. That eliminates any tendency towards religious bigotry. You can't criticize the Jews or
the Christians or the Buddhists, because you are doing their prayers too, and sharing in
their philosophy. But you wouldn't know about that, would you?
<p>
I had a very enlightening experience there. During the ceremony, my son was pointing at the symbols
on the walls, and asking what they were. Ghosts from my own childhood popped up &#8212; &quot;you are not
supposed to talk in church&quot; &#8212; so I shushed him, and told him in a whisper to be quiet.
The minister (or whatever you call him) immediately
stopped the ceremony, and squatted down beside my son, and answered his questions. He pointed out the various
symbols, and said, &quot;That's the Jewish star, that's the Christian cross, that's the crescent moon
of Islam,&quot; and so on. Then he looked up at me with a smile, and stood back up, and resumed the ceremony.
His gaze said so much. He was also teaching me. The ceremony is meaningless and useless if you don't
get the energy right, so that's why he stopped the ceremony, fixed the energy, and then continued.

<p>
Imagining that Moslems are all alike, and that they are all terrorists,
is like thinking that there is no difference between the
Quakers and the Ku Klux Klan. They are all Christians, aren't they?

<p><li>
Finally, you wrote:
<p>

<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When theres something helping people in trouble how could someone be against it,

hell can you put that down?&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Well, that's the whole thing, isn't it? <b>A.A. does not work.</b>
A.A. just 
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increases the

Subject:  	Hey Interesting Stuff<br>

<p>
I stopped going to AA about 4 months ago officially after almost
14 years. And I think I was a &quot;bad AA&quot; as all I did was go to meetings
and make coffee once in a while.

<p>
I love your book and thanks for all the writing and research.  I keep
telling myself I need to stop reading it though because it gets me so
!ANGRY!! HA.  Fucking AA.  I guess I am just surprised it took me so long to
listen to my intuition, and think for myself without hesitation.

<p>
I have never liked the Big Book and now I can say, I WILL NEVER PICK IT UP
AGAIN!  Such rubbish.

<p>
Unfortunately I work as a counselor at a TC in Manhattan (trained graphic
designer, I have no idea how that happened).  But I do my best at being
fair, and doing my job as directed.  Accountability is not such a bad
thing,  taking the &quot;bench&quot; is a bit weird... but at least they legally are
not wearing signs and shaving heads :)

<p>
Yikes.

<p>
Planning on getting my master in Social Work so I can transition to another
modality and continue to help people in some way.

<p>
Thanks for listening

<p>
Oh, also, I got tired of feeling like shit and AA was doing nothing for me
except making things worse with the Bull Shit.  I got a therpist and
Psychiatrist who both agreed with me that I should stop going to meetings.
Best advice I've gotten in years.

<p>
I have an analogy regarding talking to people manipulated in AA about the
reality of AA, it's like trying to teach a pig to sing; it wastes your time
and annoys the pig.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Stefan,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better.
Welcome to freedom and sanity.
<p>
Getting your Masters sounds like a very good thing to do. That will give you
the credentials to be influential and get other treatment modalities established.
And it will give you the credentials to contradict and argue with
the current talking heads who pretend to be knowledgeable recovery
counselors because they have a diploma. (Remember the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz?
At the end of the movie, the Wizard declared that there were all kinds of &quot;experts&quot;
and &quot;authorities&quot; and &quot;thinkers&quot;
who didn't have any more brains than the Scarecrow. But they did have
one thing that the Scarecrow didn't have &#8212; a diploma.)
<p>
So have a good day now, and a good life.

<p>
Hello,

<p>
Yes, I've been drinking off and on since I was a teenager. I've had a DUI. I
stopped drinking over a month ago because I was just fed up with my own crap
and drinking was not fun anymore, not even one. I'm an athelete and it just
didn't make sense anymore.
<p>
I stopped going to AA a couple of weeks ago because it was actually making
my life worse! I become more depressed, felt bad about myself every time I
walked out of the room. My sponsor was Hell on wheels. Calling my cell and
yelling at me if I didn't call her. I was so pissed off at this place that I
left town for 5 days to ride my mountain bike in Moab, UT. During that time
I chilled out and realized I wanted nothing to do with this place.
<p>
People would say until I gave it up and just became part of the Herd, my
life would be hell. To declare myself a drunk when I say my name, I'm a
sinner, not like anyone else.. normal people don't do this. I felt like I
just joined a cult.

<p>
So tonight I went online and googled, &quot;AA can really be a negative place&quot;. I
was thinking maybe I'm just a failure for not &quot;going along with AA&quot;. Then I
read your entire article on,
 &quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The effectiveness of the twelve-step
treatment</a>&quot;
 I just really want to thank you for that paper. I'm 39, educated,
love athletics; have so much good going on. I have no desire to drink; it's
me, not those people down at AA helping me. I understand how AA could
actually cause people to return to the bars. They basically preach you have
no good sense so all these smart wise people in AA will kindly show you the
way to happiness. You know, I've never seen a flippin happy person in AA;
I've seen a false sense of power over others, preaching, lecturing, putting
people down... DONE.  I don't have this sick desire to drink daily. I haven't
had it since I just decided enough was enough.

<p>
Your acticle actually made me feel better and even more confident, I just
don't drink anymore, end of story. Maybe I won't go to Hell after all. :)
<p>
yikes

Hello Teresa,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Yes, you've got it.
If alcohol is making you sick and ruining your life, then just don't drink any more alcohol.
It's so simple. No need for cult religion, no need for putting yourself down and
labeling yourself a powerless unspiritual alcoholic sinner. Just walk away
from it all and be free.

<p>
Have a good day, and a good life now.

 24: The Last Hurrah: Up With People</a>)<br>

<p>
I don't know who you are nor where your information on MRA and Up With
People comes from, but I was a (small) part of that experience and
movement and I want you to know that my experience of it was nothing
like what you recount. My uncle was a correspondent of Frank Buchman
and of Peter Howard and through him I met both men and had the
opportunity for several (more or less private) discussions with them
about Moral Re-Armament. Neither man ever displayed any of the ego-
centric characteristics of the cult leader, none of the &quot;I have the
one and only true way&quot; nor the &quot;you must do what I tell you to&quot;
behaviors that psychologists and sociologists have identified as key
elements of the cult leader. In my personal experience, both of them
consistently displayed the appropriate humility of a man who knows he
is imperfect yet seeking to understand God's will and follow it as
best he can. Of course, both also displayed the fire and determination
of, let's say, a Martin Luther in challenging what they say as &quot;the
establishment's&quot; failures to be guided by God's will. But both of them
consistently allowed for others to disagree with them, even publicly,
and certainly allowed people to leave the &quot;movement&quot; whenever they
wished and even encouraged others to start their own movements where
they felt a calling to do so.

<font color="blue">
Hello Jeff,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. So, you met Frank Buchman and Peter Howard for what,
several fifteen-minute or one-hour conversations?
And because they were nice to you then, you have decided that they were not dogmatic cult leaders?
Do you really think that Frank Buchman would reveal all of his worst characteristics
to you in a short period of time? He was a very skilled cult leader.
He was good at fooling people.

<p>
Cult leaders are usually clever and intelligent, and know how to deceive and manipulate
people. That is how they become successful cult leaders, while less-skilled
con artists fail to attract and hold a following and build up a big cult.
Being charismatic is also a big plus for any cult leader.
<p>
&quot;Displaying humility&quot; does not prove that someone is good, or a virtuous Christian.
See the signature below.
<p>
Both Frank Buchman and Peter Howard most assuredly did make many declarations like
&quot;I have the one and only true way&quot; and &quot;you must do what I tell you to&quot;.
Have you actually bothered to read their books and speeches, and see what they really said,
and taught and promoted?

Those fools did not know God's will.
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Hitler_interview" target="_blank">Frank Buchman went around

<a href="orange-rroot420.html" target="_blank">

<a href="orange-rroot420.html#Howard_sat" target="_blank">
Peter Howard sat out the war</a> and did nothing to help Britain in her fight for survival.

The arrogance of those two creeps to even hint that they knew God's will better than other men.
Outrageous. They did not really display humility at all.
<i>&quot;Failures to be guided by God's will&quot;</i>, indeed.
<p>
And the Nazi thing was just the tip of the iceberg. Frank Buchman and Peter Howard spent
their lives promoting a heretical unChristian cult religion while pretending that they
were talking to God and practicing Christianity.
<ul>
<p><li>
While Jesus Christ said, &quot;Help the poor, feed the hungry, clothe the naked,&quot;
Frank Buchman
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#no_charity" target="_blank">refused to give out a penny in charity</a>, and
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#fur_coats" target="_blank">attacked those who said that he should</a>.

<p><li>
While Christ said, &quot;It will be easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into Heaven,&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#fur_coats" target="_blank">Buchman
said, &quot;There is no difference between the rich and the poor,&quot;</a>
 and
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#Astoria" target="_blank">Buchman
lived in royal splendor in the Waldorf-Astoria
and the Mayfair Hotels</a>.

<p><li>
While Christ said, &quot;Do not be like the Pharisees. Do not seek signs.
Do not demand to see miracles,&quot; Buchman said,
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#coincidences" target="_blank">Seek signs. Look at
coincidences as signs</a>. Listen for voices in your Quiet Time.&quot;

<p><li>
Where Christ declared, &quot;Learn the truth, and the truth shall set you free,&quot;
Buchman hypocritically lied like a rug while yammering about &quot;Absolute Honesty&quot;,
and declaring that
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#living_spirit" target="_blank">everybody has to be a slave
of a dictator</a>.

<p><li>
Jesus Christ taught that people should be responsible for their behavior, and
refrain from doing evil, and actively work at doing good. Frank Buchman taught that
people were &quot;defeated by sin&quot;, and had to surrender control
of their lives to &quot;<i>God</i>&quot;,
and let that &quot;<i>God</i>&quot; tell them what to do.
Even worse, Frank Buchman then declaired that the common people could
not hear the voice of God correctly, so
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">they had to &quot;check Guidance&quot;</a>
with their sponsor or other Group elders, so
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#paradox" target="_blank">the Oxford Group leaders
usurped the authority of God</a>,
and they, not God, ended up telling the rank and file members what to do,
and what God supposedly said.
Upon what authority did Frank Buchman declare that
<a href="orange-rroot270.html#Gods_mind" target="_blank">he knew God's will and God's plan</a>?
That is the height of arrogance.


<p><li>
&#8212; Which brings up, there is nothing in the Bible that says that
you can just &quot;surrender to God&quot;, and God will then &quot;Guide&quot;
you and make you into a well-behaved puppet who is &quot;under God-control&quot;
all of the time.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#authority" target="_blank">
As Marjorie Harrison declared</a>:
<font color="black">
&quot;Dr. Buchman has no authority whatever for his doctrine
of direct guidance available at any moment.&quot;
</font>


<p><li>
The Biblical statement is, &quot;Thou shalt earn thy bread by the sweat of thy brow&quot;,
but
Frank Buchman believed in getting his bread by the sweat of other people's brows.
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#sweat" target="_blank">
Buchman taught his followers to live off of contributors' donations: &quot;Where God Guides,
God Provides.&quot;</a>
And of course that meant that Buchman did not believe in sharing the wealth. While
Frank Buchman
lived in first-class luxury, his followers had to scrounge donations for themselves, or
starve.

</ul>
<p>
And it just goes on and on. Frank Buchman was not guided by God.
I will leave it to others to decide whether Buchman was Guided by Satan, or just guided
by his own evil impulses.
<p>
You know, Jeff, the day that you met Frank Buchman might be the day that you came as
close to the Devil as you are ever going to come in this lifetime.

<p>
Have a good day.

Hi I wonder whether you can answer a couple of questions I have.

<p>
I have been dry for a year but I still feel angry and upset with myself.
I want to drink again and I know that it will kill me if I do.

<p>
I have thought about going to AA. Is it as bad as you are saying it is?

<p>
I want to make new friends and get some support so will it be a
dangerous as you say to go along?

<p>
Do they want anything from me for going to AA?

<p>
You say it's a cult but I always think of cults as having an agenda.

<p>
I can't see what anybody in AA is going to gain from me by me going to
meetings?

<p>
Can you tell me.

<p>
Will they brainwash me and if they do will they take my money off me?

cannot do it; you are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, and that A.A. gets
the credit for your sobriety. Be prepared for that.
<p>
In fact, be prepared to be lied to a lot. And if you challenge their lies and try to
tell the truth, they will silence you and mock you and ostracize you.
If you think you are feeling angry and frustrated by not drinking now, wait until
you see how angry you feel at what they will do to you in A.A.
<p>
Remember that A.A.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increases the
rate of binge drinking</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">increases the death rate
in alcoholics</a>.

<p>
Now in all fairness, you might actually enjoy some of the community and fellowship at
an A.A. meeting. But understand that it will come at a high price. They do not want
your money. Their goal is not to brainwash you and get your wallet.
(That makes A.A. an unusual cult.) They just want your mind, your life, and your soul.
<p>
But really, I would look for an alternative group. SMART and SOS and Lifering come to
mind.
They have both face-to-face meetings and online meetings.
<a href="orange-letters186.html#alt_list" target="_blank">Here is the list of such groups. Click on this link</a>.

<p>
<a href="orange-letters193.html#recovery_depression" target="_blank">Also see this recent letter</a>
where we were talking about dealing with the emotional turmoil that comes with recovery.
And don't forget the B vitamins.
<p>
You can also see the lists of &quot;what works&quot; to pick out the
items that relate to emotional recovery.
<a href="orange-letters177.html#what_works" target="newwin7319">The short list is here</a>, and
<a href="orange-letters170.html#what_works" target="newwin37">the longer list is here</a>.
And
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">more thoughts about what has worked
for me is here</a>.

<p>
Oh, by the way, what you are feeling is normal. I also went through a period of
feeling angry and frustrated, especially in the second and third years of sobriety,
and I was warned about that by another fellow who was
going through it before me. Alcohol makes major changes to the brain, and it takes
some time to heal the damage.

<p>
Have a good day now, and have a good life.

I am really enjoying the articles &#8212; especially this one &#8212; I completely agree
that when we are getting sober and starting to actually feel good and get
our self respect back &#8212; AA wants to focus on your character defects and
shortcomings, etc. &#8212; just what I don't need &#8212; I was always good at cutting
myself down and probably apologized way too much when I was drinking &#8212; now I
just want to be happy and rejoice &#8212; no more whining and complaining, please.

<p>
Thanks so much for this website &#8212; I feel free again &#8212; just like when I
decided to stop (before another round of AA) &#8212; I know I do not want to drink
anymore and believe in self reliance more than dependency on a strange set
of rules to obey. . . .

<p>
Thanks,

Hi Carla,

Thanks for the thanks. You've got it. You understand. I don't need to tell you

Here, you can easily see the large difference in size between the gosling
sexes at this age. The small gosling in
the middle, whose head you cannot see, is a girl. She is dwarfed by her brothers.
The fourth gosling, in the upper right, where you can only see the head, looks like
another girl. We cannot see the size of her body, but her head is smaller and narrower
than her brothers' heads. So it looks like this family has two boys and two girls.

BLOG NOTE: 20 October 2010.
<p>
Well, here it is. The anniversary. Now it's 10 years off of alcohol and drugs.
How time flies.
And in three more weeks, it will be 10 years without a cigarette.
<p>
And it's ten years of sobriety without any cult religion, or doing the 12 Steps,
or having a sponsor, or &quot;admitting I am powerless over alcohol&quot;,
or going to meetings and bragging about how A.A. and God are saving me,
or any of that garbage.
<p>
Free at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last.
<p>
And to celebrate, I'm going to a lake with a girlfriend to photograph wildlife.
<p>
Have a good day. I will.

<p>
Hi Orange

<p>
It's your 10 year anniversary!

<p>
Massive respect to you and heartfelt thanks for all you've been doing to expose
the damaging 12-step racket for what it really is. Reading what you write has
been a huge help,  comfort and inspiration to me personally, and I'm sure to
thousands of others. I can't thank you enough for that.

<p>
I love the way you deal with all the letters that tell you that you're either an
alcoholic who could not stay sober so have a &quot;resentment&quot; against AA. Or &#8212; 
equally &#8212; those that tell you you are not an alcoholic and therefore don't know
what you're talking about. I love the way you answer people with facts and quiet
reason, because you, unlike AA apologists, have actually bothered to research
the facts and have enough respect for people to argue with reason and not with
unthinking slogans. I love your dry sense of humour, your compassion, your
energy, and your anger at this terrible fraud that is perpetuated under the
guise of &quot;helping&quot; alcoholics and addicts. I love the fact that that there must
be so many steppers out there who really hope (and are probably praying to the
AA god) that you will start drinking again, and that you prove them wrong again
and again.  I love your geese too.

<p>
This is an unashamed bit of fan mail. But if you can't have that on significant
dates like this, when can you?

<p>
Have a great day, and wishing you many, many more happy years.

<p>
Stacy

Hi Stacy,
<p>
Thank you for the good wishes. And yes, I think we can have a bit of fan mail on a date like
this.  &nbsp; &nbsp; :-)
<p>
And thanks for all of the compliments.
<p>
And you know what just occurred to me? Not to gloat too much, but I am going to gloat a bit:
After 10 years, my 12-Step-oriented &quot;counselor&quot; that I got
in that Portland Alternate Addiction Center &quot;treatment program&quot; that I talked about
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">in the introduction to the web site</a>
is now out of prison, is still on parole, and is labeled a sex offender for life.
And I, on the other hand, by following <i>none</i> of his instructions and teachings
&#8212; other than &quot;don't drink or dope&quot; &#8212; am
celebrating my 10th anniversary off of drugs and alcohol and cigarettes.
<p>
I never imagined an outcome like that 10 years ago. Now I did believe that I would make it,
because I was determined to recover my health and not die of alcohol
addiction or emphysema or lung cancer,
but I never imagined that I would end up doing this web site while he would go to prison
for snorting cocaine and raping children.
<p>
Wow. Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.
<p>
So you have a good day too.
<p>
