<p>
The Twelve Steps were, right from the very start,
intended to start a new religion, to give the followers
&quot;vital spiritual experiences&quot;
and to turn the followers into religious fanatics &#8212; <i>&quot;religiomaniacs&quot;</i>.
Bill Wilson believed that religious fanaticism was <i><b>the only
answer</b></i> for alcoholism.
Bill often misquoted,
&quot;The only radical remedy for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot; (Bill attributed that quote to Carl Jung,
but Jung never said it. It came from
<a href="orange-rroot030.html#William_James">page 263 of William James' book</a>,
&quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;.)

<p>

But what if you disagree with that message? What if you
would prefer to keep the religious
beliefs you already have? What if you choose to not believe in
the Twelve Steps, and, since they
are supposedly only a suggestion, you freely choose to not do the &quot;suggestions&quot;?
What if you just want to quit drinking, without becoming
a religious convert?
<p>
Well, you can still join A.A., because the only official
requirement for membership is a
desire to stop drinking, but you won't really be a full-fledged
member. The hard-core true
believers have a deprecating name for such members:
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#two_stepper" target="_blank">One-steppers</a>&quot;.
People who only practice
the first step, admitting that they have lost control of their
drinking. People who want to quit
drinking, and regain control of their lives, but without all
of the neurotic wallowing in guilt and grovelling before God that
the other eleven steps entail. 
The true believers will tell you that you can't do that: you have
to practice all twelve steps all of the time, or you will relapse.
<p>
<a name="abstaining">
When people do quit</a> without the Twelve Steps, and without
even attending A.A. meetings,
the A.A. true believers will say that those people are not really
&quot;in recovery&quot;; they are only
&quot;abstaining.&quot; What's the difference? Some counselors
have lists of such differences, like:
<p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="5" width="75%">
<tr>
<td width="50%"><center><font size="+1"><b>Recovery</b></font></center></td>
<td width="50%"><center><font size="+1"><b>Abstinence</b></font></center></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>
Recovery requires working on all of the problems and issues that led
one to drink in the first place.</td>
<td>Abstinence is refraining from drinking by will power alone.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Recovery involves major lifestyle changes.</td>
<td>Abstinence doesn't.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Recovery involves developing a support group or system.</td>
<td>Abstinence doesn't. </td>
</tr><tr>

<td>Recovery requires working on yourself and fixing what is broken.</td>
<td>Abstinence doesn't.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<br>

But the A.A.
true believers don't even ask about such differences, they just
automatically proclaim that anyone
who doesn't drink, and who also doesn't attend A.A. meetings, is
&quot;only abstaining&quot;, while someone
who is attending A.A. meetings and &quot;doing the Steps&quot;
is of course &quot;in recovery,&quot; whether they are actually
working on any other issues or not.

<p>
<a name="dry_drunk"> </a>
And the dogmatic believers will proclaim that the &quot;abstainer&quot;
is not really enjoying a period of &quot;sobriety&quot;, he is
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#not_dry" target="_blank">only
dry</a>&quot;.
To accomplish this twist in logic, they bombastically redefine
the word &quot;sobriety&quot; as:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f">
SOBRIETY: A special state of Grace gained by working the Steps and
maintaining absolute abstinence. It is characterized by
feelings of Serenity and Gratitude. It is a state of living
according to God's will, not one's own. It is
sanity.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Even the word &quot;sanity&quot; is redefined there, as
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's</a>
sin-free,
&quot;surrendered-to-God&quot; (or surrendered-to-Frank), state of living
&#8212; spending one's life &quot;doing the will of God&quot;,
<a href="orange-cult_a6.html#receive_guidance" target="_blank">as defined by the cult</a>,
rather than &quot;doing one's own will.&quot;

<p>
Likewise, the true believers will say that the &quot;abstainer&quot;
is a &quot;dry drunk.&quot; &quot;Dry
drunk&quot; is yet another imaginary disease invented by
Alcoholics Anonymous. The term originally
referred to a rather rare condition that some people have during
the first months of recovery from alcohol abuse &#8212; they
stumble around in an uncoordinated manner as if they are drunk,
even though they are 100%
sober. But A.A. has turned it into a slur, which is supposed to
mean that someone is thinking and acting like
a drunk man, displaying all of the objectionable characteristics of
an obnoxious drunk, even though he is sober. And supposedly, all sober
men who won't do the Twelve
Steps will suffer from that condition, and will also become
bitterly unhappy as well...
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If an addict drops out of the Twelve Step system but remains
totally abstinate from chemicals, he is said to be a
&quot;dry drunk.&quot;  He is not sober because sobriety requires
the ongoing practice of Twelve Stepping.  Some also refer to the
state of being a dry drunk as &quot;white knuckle sobriety&quot;
and believe that such a person is a veritable walking time bomb,
ready to descend with no warning precipitously into orgies of
drunken oblivion unless he returns to practicing Twelve
Stepdom.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>The Useful Lie</i>,
by William L. Playfair, M.D.</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
On the other hand, Paul Roasberry wrote in his essay <i>The Cult Called A.A.</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Of course, all cults have this in common: they reject and label
as untouchables any who do not embrace their particular version
of &quot;Truth.&quot; To dyed-in-the-wool communists, non-believers are
&quot;bootlickers of the capitalists,&quot; or &quot;counter-revolutionary hooligans.&quot;
To the born again fundamentalist Christian, non-believers are
&quot;agents of Satan.&quot; To Moslems, Christians are &quot;devils,&quot; and to
Nazis, Jews are &quot;swine.&quot; To the Alcoholics Anonymous membership,
anyone who stops drinking without chanting the mantras of cult
founder Bill W. are &quot;dry drunks,&quot; pure and simple. You don't
even need to know anything more about the self-quitters &#8212; the
fact that they quit drinking without A.A. makes them dry drunks,
<i>a priori</i>.<br>
</font>
<a href="orange-Cult_Called_AA.html" target="_blank">
<font size="-1"><i>The Cult Called A.A.</i>, Paul Roasberry</font></a>
</blockquote>

<p>
And, unfortunately, 12-Step true believers seem very reluctant to do a reality
check there, and compare their theories to actual results:
If the A.A. member relapses, while the so-called
&quot;abstainer&quot; or &quot;dry drunk&quot; doesn't,
the A.A. fanatics will just
blame their fellow A.A. member for &quot;defects of
character&quot;, and &quot;constitutional incapability to be
honest with himself&quot;, and for not practicing the Twelve
Steps properly &#8212; for not &quot;working a strong program&quot;,
and perhaps for &quot;holding something back in the Fifth Step&quot;
&#8212; while they simply ignore
the nonmember abstainer, or proclaim that &quot;He'll still
relapse, it's just a matter of time.&quot; Under no
conditions will the A.A. fanatics question
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">the effectiveness of the
A.A. Twelve Step program</a> for actually quitting drinking and staying quit.

<a name="Kurtz"> </a>
In his book, <i>Not-God</i>, Ernest Kurtz gives us an explanation of
the <i>dry drunk</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Confronted with the problems and concerns of &quot;living sober,&quot;
aware from often tragic experience of the special danger to alcoholics
of such personality pitfalls as grandiosity, resentments, and the
tendencies to dominance over or excessive dependence upon others,
old-time members began to formulate a significant three-faceted
distinction. &quot;Active alcoholism&quot; was the condition of
the obsessive-compulsive drinker who continued to imbibe alcohol.
From this situation, <i>two</i> others were to be distinguished.
The first was that of the &quot;merely dry&quot; former obsessive-compulsive
drinker who &quot;put a cork in the bottle&quot; yet
continued to &quot;think alcoholically&quot;; i.e., to entertain
grandiose plans and expectations, to nurse feelings of resentment,
etc. In &quot;true sobriety&quot; or &quot;serenity,&quot; one
embraced a new &quot;way of life&quot;; i.e., abandoned grandiosity,
resentments, and other claims to be &quot;special,&quot; and
became aware that one's only true dependence was on the &quot;Higher
Power&quot; &#8212; that the <i>whole</i> program of the Twelve Steps
of Alcoholics Anonymous was to be utilized in <i>all</i> aspects
of daily life.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Not-God</i>, Ernest Kurtz, page 123.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

What nonsense. Such absolute, sweeping, grandiose statements,
like that we must
only be dependent on a <i>Higher Power</i> and that we must practice
the Twelve Steps in <i>all</i> aspects of daily life, reinforce the
very type of grandiose thinking that they are denouncing.
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(And don't you love how Kurtz declares that alcoholics suffer from
<i>&quot;excessive dependence upon others&quot;</i>, and the answer
is to depend on God more....)
</font>

<p>
They say that we are supposed to &quot;practice these principles
[the Twelve Steps] in all our affairs.&quot; (That is Step Twelve.)
Are we supposed to practice the Twelve Steps while shopping for
groceries at the supermarket? Maybe I should list all of my sins
while in the bread aisle? Confess all of my sins to whomever is in
the meat section? Make amends to the vegetables? Do my Twelfth Step
work by recruiting the check-out girl and the bag boy as new
<i>pigeons</i> and <i>babies</i> for Alcoholics Anonymous or
Al-Anon?
<p>
Heaven forbid, I'd better not do my First Step and
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>Admit That I'm Powerless Over Alcohol</i>
</font>
while I'm in the beer and wine aisle or I might start grabbing bottles and 6-packs.
<p>

Note that Kurtz is again giving us a mystical or superstitious definition of alcoholism
&#8212; it's a &quot;spiritual disease&quot;.
According to A.A. theology, alcoholism is not actually caused by drinking
alcohol. Strange but true.
Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i> that
<font color="#7f00cf">
&quot;Bottles were only a symbol&quot;</font>
(BB, p. 103.) and 
<font color="#7f00cf">
&quot;Our liquor was but a symptom.&quot;</font>
(BB, p. 64.). Wilson and A.A. say that
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#alcoholism_causes" target="_blank">alcoholism has all kinds of causes</a>,
ranging from resentments to sins to
defects of character to moral shortcomings
to instincts run wild and self-will run riot,
and &quot;<a href="orange-secrets.html#exceed_intended_purpose" target="_blank">desires that far exceed their intended purpose</a>&quot;,
but drinking alcohol isn't one of the causes of alcoholism.
As you might have guessed, Bill Wilson wasn't a doctor.

<p>
Now it is true that many alcoholics have underlying medical or mental
problems.
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#Lemanski" target="_blank">More than 50% are overtly disturbed</a>.
About 40% of alcoholics have suffered from
child abuse, and others suffer from physical illnesses.
And many women alcoholics were raped as teenagers.
Often, alcoholics drink to relieve the symptoms of mental problems
like clinical depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, borderline personality
disorder, narcissistic personality disorder,
or pain that is caused by some other illness.
But such people are better treated with
Paxil, Zoloft, Prozac, or a good painkiller than with the
voodoo faith-healing medicine of the Twelve Steps.
And note that we are talking about underlying medical problems,
while the A.A. pundits like to claim that all of our troubles
are due to underlying <i>sin</i> problems (like &quot;selfishness&quot;, and
not doing the Twelve Steps, and not doing the Will of God).
<p>
Lastly, the Twelve Steps of Bill Wilson are still nothing but
<a href="orange-interpreted.html" target="_blank">a formula for building up a cult religion</a>,
not a therapy program for alcoholism.
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Frank Buchman</a>
developed the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchmanite_tenets" target="_blank">cult practices</a>
that are embodied in the Twelve
Steps for the purpose of recruiting and indoctrinating new members
for his Oxford Groups cult.
Those practices had nothing to do with quitting drinking.

<p>
<a name="Kurtz2"> </a>
Ernest Kurtz continued with his explanation of <i>dry drunks</i>, and it
became quite religious
(<a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">religious, not &quot;spiritual&quot;</a>):

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The &quot;merely dry&quot; or &quot;dry drunk&quot; state was
precarious, whether as an intermediate stage between &quot;active
alcoholism&quot; and &quot;true sobriety,&quot; or as simply a
falling away from &quot;true sobriety.&quot; A person in this dry
but alcoholic condition suffered from much or all of the torment
formerly soothed in some way by alcohol, but the accustomed
painkiller was no longer an available option, and the fact that
&quot;active alcoholism&quot; had been overcome inhibited any
perception of &quot;bottom&quot; that could lead to the
&quot;surrender&quot; required for &quot;conversion&quot;
to &quot;true sobriety.&quot; It was a purgatory worse than hell,
for one suffered the torment under the illusion that this was
heaven; further, from this alcoholic limbo one passed more usually
to the hell of active alcoholism than to the heaven of true
sobriety.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Not-God</i>, Ernest Kurtz, page 123.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>

Kurtz says that our underlying problems will become more apparent
when we quit drinking, because we will no longer have the anaesthetic
effect of alcohol to mask our pain. There is some truth to that.
But then Kurtz tries to shove a big, veiled, assumption past us:
that alcoholism
is essentially caused by sin, and that the Twelve Steps are the
cure for sin. Remember that he had defined &quot;true sobriety&quot;
as a serene state of mind, free from resentments and other bad
things &#8212; a state of mind that could allegedly only be achieved by
doing Bill's
Twelve Steps, including listing and confessing all of your sins
for the rest of your life.
Their idea of &quot;alcoholic&quot; really means that someone is a sinner,
not that someone actually drinks alcohol. (They even accuse
<a href="orange-heresy.html#children" target="_blank">children who have never drunk alcohol in their lives</a>
of &quot;behaving alcoholically&quot; if the children just act, well, childishly.)

<p>
And note the phrase,
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>&quot;dry but alcoholic condition&quot;</i></font>.
That is a dead give-away that they define alcoholism as something
separate from alcohol. According to Kurtz and A.A., you can be in an
&quot;alcoholic condition&quot; without drinking any alcohol at all,
and you won't have &quot;true sobriety&quot;, they say,
if you don't practice Bill Wilson's religion.

<p>
So, according to Kurtz, we will get a Serene Heaven on Earth if we
do Bill's Twelve Steps, and we will go to Hell if we don't.
<p>
Look at the fear-mongering: Kurtz says that people who only quit drinking,
without becoming religious fanatics, are in danger:<br>
<font color="#5f008f">
<i>The &quot;merely dry&quot; or &quot;dry drunk&quot; state was
precarious...&quot;</i></font><br>
Precarious?<br>
Ernest Kurtz gave us no evidence to support his statement that people
who are in the A.A. idea of &quot;purgatory&quot; &#8212;
people who have quit drinking but who aren't doing the Twelve Steps &#8212;
are more likely to relapse and return
to active drinking than to stay dry.<br>
What longitudinal controlled study, survey, or poll showed that?<br>
When?<br>
What population was Kurtz examining? A.A. members? Ex-A.A. members?
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#Lisa_Marie_Presley" target="_blank">Scientologists</a>?<br>

How much more likely to relapse are the non-steppers than the Steppers?<br>
Show me the numbers.
<p>
The Harvard Medical School
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">says just the
opposite</a> of what Kurtz is telling us: They say that 80%
of those alcoholics who successfully quit and stay quit for a year
or more do it <i><b>on their own</b></i>,
without Alcoholics Anonymous and its Twelve Steps, or any other
&quot;therapy program&quot; or &quot;support group&quot;.
<p>
The
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health,
performed the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions. For it, they interviewed over 43,000 people. Using the criteria for alcohol
dependence found in the DSM-IV, they found:<br>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;About 75 percent of persons who recover from alcohol dependence do
so without seeking any kind of help, including specialty alcohol (rehab)
programs and AA. Only 13 percent of people with alcohol dependence ever
receive specialty alcohol treatment.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So was Kurtz just making stuff up? Or just parroting
<a href="orange-aalies.html" target="_blank">the standard A.A. dogma and misinformation</a>?

<p><br>
<a name="Molloy_quote"> </a>
One of the most outrageous sermons on the subject of dry drunk behavior
and codependency comes from
Paul Molloy, in his A.A.-booster book <i>Where Did Everybody Go?</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Some recognized experts on the problem, like Vernon Johnson,
are convinced that the only difference between the alcoholic
and his nonalcoholic loved ones is that one is physically
affected by the chemical; otherwise, all have all
the other symptoms. The &quot;dry&quot; are as sick as the drunk,
except that the bodily damage is not there. With every drunk
there is a sick &quot;dry&quot; who is almost a mirror image.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Carry Amelia Nation, the hatchet-swinging, saloon-smashing
temperance advocate, divorced her first husband, who was
an alcoholic. Because he was an active member of a fraternal 
order, she later turned her fury against such organizations,
then against tobacco, foreign foods, corsets, skirts that
were not long enough for her liking and paintings of nudes.
Her second husband, David Nation, divorced her on grounds
of desertion. The Encyclopedia Britannica called her
autobiography &quot;a hodgepodge of disorder.&quot; She had such a
morbid preoccupation with liquor that she couldn't hang on
to her husbands and all but neglected her daughter.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I have to believe that Carry Nation, who would never let
a drop sully her lips, had a monumental booze problem.
Alcoholism is, indeed, a &quot;family disease.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Where Did Everybody Go?</i>, Paul Molloy, page 165.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So, according to Paul Molloy, Carrie Nation was infected with
the dreaded spiritual disease of &quot;codependency&quot; by her first
husband, and she never recovered from it.
She was allegedly &quot;a dry drunk&quot; for the rest of her life, without ever
having drunk a single drop of alcohol in her entire life.
<p>
Molloy offered us no evidence that Carry Nation wasn't already crazy before marriage,
and Molloy gave us no diagnosis of her extreme behavior and
apparent obsessive mental problems other than that she had
&quot;a non-drinking booze problem&quot; &#8212; that she was a dry drunk.
That is absurd. And that is worse than amateur pop psychology.

<p>
Neither the American Medical Association nor The American
Psychiatric Association recognize the existence of any such disease as
&quot;a non-drinking booze problem&quot;, or
&quot;dry drunk&quot;, or &quot;codependency&quot;.
<p>
And once again, we see that Alcoholics Anonymous redefines alcoholism as a
vague &quot;spiritual&quot; disease that actually has nothing to do with
drinking alcohol.

<p><br>
<a name="Taylor1"> </a>
We get another example of the same word redefinition stunt in another
stepper's book on quitting drugs and alcohol:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I was about nine months into continuous abstinence and going through
a particularly difficult period. This was because even though I had
gone more than nine months without a drug, including alcohol, I had
little real recovery yet, and that was due to the fact that I was still
trying to hold onto my old ideas. I was in what's called a dry drunk.
I was very angry most of the time and had no idea why.
Nobody was doing anything to me, and things were going better than they
had been in a long time. I was just angry, with a bad attitude, most of
the time.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>How to Quit Drugs including Alcohol</i>, L. Douglas Taylor, page 98.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
This 12-Stepper actually declares that &quot;recovery&quot;
is not really caused by abstaining from drugs and alcohol &#8212; not even
by nine months of abstinence &#8212; which is nonsense.
Of course the guy is recovering, and getting some &quot;real recovery&quot;.
For nine months now, his brain, liver, and kidneys have been
healing and rebuilding themselves, his head is getting clearer, and his over-all
health is improving.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
But once again, Alcoholics Anonymous redefines words like &quot;recovery&quot;
in a 
&quot;spiritual&quot; way that has more to do with practicing the 12-Step
cult religion than in actually abstaining from drugs and alcohol and physically
recovering from the damage done.

<li>
And once again, if you ever feel angry and frustrated,
the steppers say that you are a &quot;dry drunk&quot;.
<li>
And this author declares that
recovery requires letting go of your old ideas. (<i>And replacing them with
what, 12-Step dogma?</i>) What 'old ideas' must be discarded?

<li>
Obviously, the author's idea of 'recovery' involves not feeling your
feelings, and never feeling angry or frustrated.
He just wants <i>Serenity and Gratitude</i> all of the time.
</ul>

<p>
Similary, a Cocaine Anonymous book quoted a former heroin addict,
who had by then been clean and sober for twelve years, but who still complained
that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...I was still suffering from untreated drug addiction, even when I was dry.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Hope, Faith, and Courage; Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous</i>,
Cocaine Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
page 35.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Obviously, he was not. After a week or two of withdrawal, he was no longer addicted
to heroin, so he was not suffering from &quot;untreated addiction&quot;.
(What is that, anyway? Isn't the usual &quot;treatment&quot; for heroin
addiction either to shoot more heroin, or to
quit and go through withdrawal? That fellow had done both.)
Now, the former addict may have had some lingering emotional or
psychiatric problems, perhaps an anxiety disorder or PTSD, or lingering
hostility, anger, and grief issues, but that is not &quot;untreated drug addiction&quot;.
And it sure isn't the next condition that book described, where another
&quot;recovering&quot; addict declared that:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...I am powerless over the outcome of everything and that my life is still
unmanageable by me.&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Hope, Faith, and Courage; Stories from the Fellowship of Cocaine Anonymous</i>,
Cocaine Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
page 38.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That's quite some &quot;recovery&quot;.

Curiously, even A.A. founder Bill Wilson was declared to be a &quot;dry
drunk&quot; by the other early A.A. members.
<p>
When an A.A. member who was also a famous baseball player, Rollie Hemsley,
broke his anonymity in 1940,
and declared to the press that he was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous,
recovering from alcoholism, Bill went ballistic.
Bill couldn't stand the idea that someone else was getting
more publicity than him, speaking about &quot;his&quot; A.A..

So Bill Wilson broke his anonymity, too.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font>
Then Bill went on long cross-country speaking tours for several years.
He was on the road, promoting A.A., for much of the nineteen-forties.
Bill Wilson so routinely broke his anonymity and had his picture published
in newspapers that by 1944 he had become the most famous &quot;anonymous&quot;
person in the USA. Bill's biographers called his period of publicity-hound

Robert Thomsen described Bill's grandstanding after Rollie broke
his anonymity this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within a matter of weeks Bill was on the road, giving out
interviews and pictures. A group would ask him to speak,
he'd get in touch with the chairman, who'd tip off a local
reporter, then after the meeting, they'd talk, and the next
morning &#8212; if the war news didn't preempt him &#8212; he would
find his picture splashed across page one, often with a rousing
account of the number of hopeless drunks he had saved. It was
work that Bill W. thoroughly enjoyed, and in the beginning a
great many groups went along with him. But only in the beginning.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Naturally &#8212; and inevitably, as he would learn &#8212; there were loud
objections. &quot;Who does he think he is?&quot; &nbsp; &quot;What
the hell is he pulling?&quot; and &quot;what about Dr. Bob?&quot;
He wasn't the only superstar, and soon others were trying to
get into the act. And as always, AAs were not shy about expressing
their opinions. Nor was Bill. He could still rationalize his every
action. This was America, he pointed out, and there was a little
thing called free speech here. All organizations, all countries,
were being run by big-name leaders now. Secrecy might be all right
for others, but the public had a right to know who AA's founders
were.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
With that one phrase, &quot;all right for others,&quot; Bill began
to think of himself as an exception. ... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
He'd accepted Rollie's challenge and was proving that he
could command as much publicity as a ballplayer. With his old
zest for combat, the Burr and Burton boy was showing them,
showing them all. And besides, no one could deny that in some
towns his promotional schemes were getting results. More drunks
were turning up at meetings after his story appeared.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One night &#8212; and he remembered this because it was the first time
he'd heard the words &#8212; an old-timer told him that he might indeed
be the cofounder, they might owe their lives to him, but he'd better
watch himself because he was sure as hell acting like a man on a
<i>dry drunk</i>.<br>

So &quot;dry drunk&quot; can mean anything from someone who won't
do the Twelve Steps to someone who is acting like a publicity-hound
megalomaniac. Actually, I guess the phrase &quot;dry drunk&quot;
can also mean someone who is acting like Bill Wilson. And &quot;dry drunk&quot;
can also mean <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>.

<p>
Note that if the term &quot;dry drunk&quot; means all things
to all people,
then it really does not have any meaning at all. It is just some
sort of generic put-down which spares the speaker from having
to think very deeply about precisely what it is that the speaker
does not like about the other guy...

For Bill Wilson to even suggest that thousands of alcoholics would have
died if Bill Wilson had grandstanded and promoted himself (like he actually did)
is absurd. Obviously, Bill wasn't that important.
<p>
The only question remaining is, was Bill Wilson completely deluded and totally disconnected
from reality when he wrote that, or was Bill Wilson just a cold, deliberate, scheming liar?

<a name="TIME">
Something else that is funny is that Bill Wilson also made the opposite claim
&#8212; that alcoholics died because Bill Wilson did not engage in publicity.

<i><b>TIME</b></i> magazine wanted to do a cover story on Bill and
A.A., but Bill refused, believing that
he should maintain at least some small pretense of anonymity.
Later, Bill worried that
his failure to grandstand even just that one single time had
fatal consequences for many alcoholics, and he tried to guesstimate how
many alcoholics had had to pay the terrible price of Bill Wilson's modesty:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
For all I know, a piece of this sort could have brought
A.A. a thousand members &#8212; possibly a lot more.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, when I turned that article down,
I denied recovery to an awful lot of 
alcoholics &#8212; some of these may already be dead. And practically
all the rest of them,
we may suppose, are still sick and suffering.
Therefore, in a sense,
<font color="#9F0000">
my action has pronounced the death sentence
on some drunks</font>
and condemned others to a much longer period of illness.<br>

Wow. Those poor alcoholics die if Bill Wilson grandstands and promotes himself, and they die
if Bill Wilson doesn't. Those poor alcoholics just can't win.

<a name="emotional_recovery"> </a>

There is one more aspect to the dry drunk issue: the very
real problem of mentally adapting to a sober lifestyle.
People can go through a lot of emotional turmoil for years after
quitting drinking. As Alan Bisbort reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
When a recovering alcoholic begins to engage in what AA calls
&quot;stinking thinking,&quot; he or she begins to exhibit the old attitudes
and pathologies of their drinking years. These include an increase
in anxiety, mild tremors, mild depression, disturbed sleep patterns,
inability to think clearly, craving for junk food, irritability,
sudden bursts of anger and unpredictable mood swings. According
to AA literature, &quot;Boredom and listlessness may alternate with
intense feelings of resentment against family and friends, and
explosive outbursts of violence.&quot;<br>

<p>
Note that no superstitious or moralistic explanation for this
phenomenon is necessary. It's very simple.
Alcohol kills brain cells and makes major changes to the nervous system.
(And so does 20 years of whiskey and cocaine, as G. W. Bush learned...)
It can take many years for the brain to heal
the damage and overcome those effects. Many people report
feeling lots of emotional turmoil for the first few years after
quitting drinking &#8212; to the point of sometimes feeling like
seething cauldrons of anger, hostility, resentments, and pent-up frustration.

<p>
Sin is most assuredly not the cause of those neurological problems,
and Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps are not the cure. The only real
cure is time. Just hang in there and ride out the storm.<br>
Make sure you take lots of B vitamins.<br>
Also make sure that you eat a good, balanced diet. With some vegetables in it.<br>
Also get off of nicotine and caffeine as much as you can.
If you drink coffee, put milk or cream in it
to take the edge off of the caffeine.
(Latt&eacute; Brev&eacute; is good.)<br>
Don't let yourself get too tired or too hungry.<br>
Engage your mind in positive, cheerful things as much as possible.<br>
Listen to good music.<br>
Enjoy life.<br>
Go for long walks in beautiful places.<br>
Things will get better.<br>

Francis Hartigan was the secretary of and confidant to Bill Wilson's wife Lois.
This book is pretty much a white-wash and tells the whole story from Bill's point
of view. But it does contain a few surprises, like the chapter &quot;The Other Woman&quot;
which details Bill's love affair with Helen Wynn, and hints at all of his other affairs
where he cheated on Lois, both before and after sobriety, all of his married life.

This book was written by another stepper &#8212; the name 'Matthew Raphael' is a pen name &#8212;
and it generally praises Bill Wilson and recites the party line about most things,
but it also contains a bunch of surprises,
like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his and Bob's spook sessions &#8212; talking
to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping,
and channeling, LSD use, and publicity-hound megalomania.

This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is very positively
slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author knew Mr. Wilson and worked
beside him for the last 12 years of Mr. Wilson's life. And rumor has it that
this book was prepared from autobiographical tapes that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's warts,
his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his years-long
&quot;dry drunks&quot;...

<i>Dry Drunk: Is Bush making a cry for help?</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Alan Bisbort<br>
<b>American Politics Journal</b>, Sept. 24, 2002.<br>
This article is both amusing and disturbing. While getting in a few jokes
and jabs, the author asks the very serious question of whether George W. Bush
is brain-damaged from alcohol abuse:

Bush said he was a &quot;heavy drinker.&quot; But let's not be coy here. Anyone 
who has ever imbibed heavily over a long period of time knows that 
&quot;heavy drinker&quot; is the rich man's (or the politician's) code for 
alcoholic.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For the record, Bush claims to have stopped drinking for reasons that 
change each time he's asked about his substance-abusing past (which 
isn't often, thanks to a cowed press). Let's say he started 
experimenting with alcohol, as per the national norm, at 16 at prep 
school, and he began getting regularly wasted at Yale at 18. This would 
mean that Bush drank steadily &quot;heavily&quot; for at least 22 years
[because he has publicly stated that he quit drinking shortly after his
40th birthday]. We are, 
then, asked to believe that he went cold turkey after more than two 
decades of heavy drinking, a nearly impossible feat even for someone, as 
he claims, who was rescued by God. &nbsp; ...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is worth reflecting on George W. Bush's academic history. He 
graduated from two of the finest institutions of higher learning in this 
country: Yale and Harvard. He didn't make great grades, but he 
graduated, an accomplishment warranting some respect. Many rich, 
well-connected boys have flunked out. [NOTE from the editors: ...or [were]
tossed out, as was one Richard Scaife, from Yale, allegedly for his own 
love of the bottle.]<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The question is then begged, and seems to at least deserve some pause 
for pondering: how did he, at age 58, get so fumble-tongued, incapable 
of stringing more than two coherent sentences together, snippily 
irritable with anyone who dares disagree with him or even ask a 
question, poutily turning his back on the democratically elected 
president of one of our most important allies because of something one 
of his underlings said about him (Germany's Schroder, of course), 
listlessly in need of constant vacations and rest, dangerously obsessed 
with only one thing (Iraq), to the exclusion of all other things 
(including an economy that is slowly sucking the life from the nation as 
 well as the retirement savings of anyone reading these words)?<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Furthermore, why is Bush so eager to engage in violence and so incapable 
of explaining why?
For drunks to function for any length of time in the world, they need 
enablers. Congress is filling that bill splendidly right now for Bush. 
As BuzzFlash put it about the recent corporate scandals, &quot;For most of 
his adult life, those people around him enabled Bush's alcoholism. 
Now the Democratic Senate is enabling the corporate corruption problem of 
his administration by not using their Constitutional powers to demand 
the truth.&quot;  &nbsp; ...
