<ol>
<a name="not_work"> </a>
<font size="+2"><li> The Twelve Steps <a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">do not
work</a> as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.</font>
<p>
<ul>
<li> The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank">the A.A. success
rate is actually <b>less than zero</b></a>, which means that A.A.
indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery.
Some tests have shown that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_treatment" target="_blank">even receiving
<b><i>no treatment at all</i></b> for alcoholism is much better than receiving
A.A. treatment</a>:
<p>
<li> One of the most enthusiastic boosters of
Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor and medical Doctor George E. Vaillant of Harvard University,
who was also a member of the Board of Trustees
of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS),
showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">A.A. was worse than
useless</a> &#8212; that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than <i>no
treatment at all</i>, and it had the highest death rate of any
treatment program tested &#8212; a death rate that Professor Vaillant
himself described as
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">appalling</a>&quot;.
While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works,
Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills.
After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100
alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.<br>

<font color="#9F0000">
(Nevertheless, Vaillant <i>still</i> became a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and
he <i>still</i> wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#high_status_healer1" target="_blank">get an attitude
change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer</a>.&quot;</i>
That is cult religion, not a treatment program for the &quot;disease of alcoholism&quot;.)
</font>

<p>
<li> The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A.
looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the
narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing.

The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door.
The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves
hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A.,
but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what
A.A. really is. Even
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">A.A.'s own
triennial surveys</a>, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the
GSO), reveal a high dropout rate.
But the triennial survey does not count all of those people who only attended
a few A.A. meetings, or even dozens of meetings,
before quitting A.A. &#8212; they don't qualify as
&quot;A.A. members&quot;, and they are not there to be counted.
(That amounts to
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">cherry-picking</a>&quot;.)
If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.

<p>
Similarly, the leader of A.A. in Australia reported:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Our 1992 Survey showed that only 5% of newcomers to AA are still
attending meetings after 12 months. This is a truly terrible statistic.
Again we must ask 'Where does the fault lie?'&quot;<br>
</font>
&#8212; Dr Ron Whitington, Chairman of AA Australia General Service Board<br>
Comments made in AA Around Australia, Spring Edition, 1994; Commenting on a
survey of more than 100 of Australia's AA groups

<p>

<p>
<center><table width="91%" border="4" bordercolor="#9F0000" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

And also note that the apparent five percent of A.A. newcomers who
are still left after one year is exactly the same number as
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">the usual rate of spontaneous remission</a>
among alcoholics &#8212; five percent per year.

That is, in any randomly-selected population of alcoholics,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate" target="_blank">approximately five
percent per year</a> will finally get
sick and tired of being sick and tired, and they will just quit drinking.
And the Harvard Medical School says that 80% of those successful
quitters do it
<a href="#Harvard_Mental">by themselves, alone</a>, without
any &quot;treatment program&quot; or any &quot;support group&quot;.
<p>
<font size="+1" color="#9F0000">
If we subtract the normal spontaneous remission rate for alcoholism of five percent per year
from A.A.'s claimed success rate of five percent, we get zero for A.A.'s real
effective cure rate.
</font>
<p>
A.A. does not actually make anybody quit drinking; it just takes the credit for
the people who were going to quit anyway. A.A. is just taking the credit for
peoples' efforts to save their own lives.
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
And then it gets worse: The attrition continues, and it isn't just because the old-timers
all die of old age.
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins" target="_blank">Barely one percent of the newcomers
to A.A. get a 10-year coin for sobriety</a>,
and only 3/4 of one percent get the 11-year coin.
Only half of one percent &#8212; 5 out of a thousand &#8212; get the 15-year coin, and 
only one in a thousand gets the 20-year coin.

<p>
<li> Alcoholics Anonymous does not have a success rate or a retention rate.
What Alcoholics Anonymous really has is a <i>churn rate</i>.
The story of A.A. is routinely: another hundred people lured or coerced in, and then another hundred people
leave. <a href="orange-letters216.html#churn" target="_blank">Look here for much more about the A.A. churn rate</a>.

<p>
<li> The Twelve Steps are actually a hopelessly bad program for
recovery:<br>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">Cult religion</a> is not a good cure for
alcoholism, and A.A. most assuredly is a cult religion.

<a name="ftnt02_ret"> </a>
<li> One of the biggest problems with the Twelve-Step program is the
<a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">learned helplessness caused by the
First Step</a>, where people are taught to confess that they are
&quot;powerless over alcohol.&quot;
This leads many people to believe that once they have a drink, that
a full-blown relapse and total loss of self-control is inevitable
and unavoidable. So some people go on suicidally-intense binges,
thinking that it is pointless to try to resist
temptation.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt02">2</a></sup></font> 

<!-----------------------------------------------
<LI> The other half of Step One, which says that &quot;our lives had
become unmanageable&quot;, leads some people to believe that they
shouldn't even try to manage their lives, because they can't.<br>
-------------------------------------------------->

<li> Step Two is just as bad: it teaches people
that they are insane, and that only a Supernatural Being
can restore them to sanity &#8212; which means that they are helpless,
and cannot heal themselves.<br>

<li> Then Step Three teaches a lifestyle of infantile narcissism and passive
dependency, where A.A. members turn control of their wills
and their lives over to &quot;the care of God <i>as we understood
Him</i>&quot;, and then they expect God to take care of them and
run their lives for them, and
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#solve_all" target="_blank">solve all their problems</a>,
and wait on them hand and foot,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#no_hard_work" target="_blank">do all of the
hard work</a> for them from then on...
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Let Go And Let God&quot;</font>
is their official motto, their lifestyle, and their approach to
problem-solving.

<li> Then Steps Four through Ten induce guilt in the members by
forcing members to make lists of all of their sins and flaws,
and &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
and confess
every intimate dirty little secret to another A.A. member who isn't
even ordained clergy, or even sworn to secrecy.
<li> In Step Eleven you are supposed to
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult" target="_blank">&quot;channel&quot; God
and receive psychic work orders and power</a>.
<li> Then Step Twelve tells you to go recruiting, to draft more alcoholics
into this madness.

</ul>

<!--------------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<LI> Some A.A. members even believe that relapse is inevitable
whenever cravings come along, because &quot;we are powerless over
alcohol&quot;, and we will eventually suffer from
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#blank_spot" target="_blank">strange mental
blank spots</a>&quot;
where we will get drunk before we even know what is happening,
and
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;will power and self-knowledge
would not help in those strange mental blank spots.&quot;
</font>
<font size="-1">(The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, page 42.)</font>
<P>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental
defense against the first drink. Except in a few rare cases, neither
he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense
must come from a Higher Power.<br></font>

Chapter 3, <i>More About Alcoholism</i>, page 43.</font>
</blockquote>
<P>

So, A.A. says,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#drink_disappear" target="_blank">if God
doesn't remove your desire for drink, then your situation is hopeless.
You are doomed.</a> That is, of course, completely untrue.
------------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
<li> <a name="powerless_binge"> </a>
There is also experimental evidence that the A.A. teachings about
powerlessness lead to binge drinking. In
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">a controlled
study of A.A.'s effectiveness</a>, court-mandated offenders who had been
sent to A.A. for several months were engaging in <b><i>five times as
much binge drinking</i></b> as the no-treatment control group which got no A.A. &quot;help&quot;.

Jeffrey Brandsma, Maxie Maultsby, and Richard J. Welsh. University
Park Press, Baltimore, MD., page 105.)</font>
---------------------------------------------->

<p>
<li>
A.A. boosters and propagandists constantly repeat the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank"><i>Big Lie</i></a> that
A.A. works great, and A.A. with its Twelve Steps is the way that
everybody recovers:
<p>
<a name="Mooney"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One way or another Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or a similar Twelve-Step
program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries
from alcohol or drug abuse. In fact, it is widely believed
that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can
put a recovering addict on the road to relapse. For some people,
regular participation in such a mutual self-help group is all
that is needed to become and remain sober.<br></font>
<font size="-1"><a href="#rec_book"><i>The Recovery Book</i></a>,
Al J. Mooney M.D., Arlene Eisenberg, and Howard Eisenberg,
pages 40-41.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
All three of those sentences are untrue.
The truth is just the opposite of what they are telling us:
<ol>
<li> Far more people recover without A.A. than with it. The good, unbiased,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#scientific" target="_blank">medical research</a>
shows that the vast majority of people who successfully recover from alcoholism
 &#8212; like 75 or 80% of them &#8212; actually do it
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment" target="_blank">without any Twelve-Step program</a>,
or even any &quot;recovery group&quot; or &quot;treatment program&quot; of any kind.
Contrary to everything you have ever been told by 12-Step promoters and recruiters,
<font color="blue"><b>
doing it alone, quitting without any treatment program, or any &quot;support group&quot;,
or any cult religion, is actually the &quot;<i>time-tested, proven</i>&quot;
method that really works for most people.</b></font>
And the research also shows that A.A. is actually very harmful: it raises the
rates of binge drinking, re-arrests, and death.

So it doesn't matter how many people believe that not including A.A. in
a treatment program will lead to relapse &#8212; it still isn't true.
<li> And then just going to A.A. meetings does not fix alcoholics.
It tends to make them relapse and binge drink, and even die.
</ol>

<p>
Also notice all of the propaganda tricks that the authors used there:
<ul>
<li> First there is the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#everybody" target="_blank"><i>&quot;everybody's
doing it&quot;</i></a>:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost
all successful recoveries&quot;</font>.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
That is a complete falsehood.
The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any &quot;support group&quot;.
It's what &quot;everybody&quot; is doing.
</font>

<p>
<li> Then they use the propaganda techniques of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#passive_voice" target="_blank"><i>use of the passive voice</i></a>
and 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions" target="_blank"><i>vague suggestions</i></a>:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can
put a recovering addict on the road to relapse.&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know?
What are their qualifications?
Are they doctors?
Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center?
Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?
</font>

<p>
<li> The authors also use the propaganda technique of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#adverse_consequences" target="_blank">fear-mongering</a>:
you will be <font color="#4f007f">&quot;on the road to relapse&quot;</font>
 &#8212; you will probably die &#8212; 
unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.
<p>
<li> And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A.
meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal
rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true.
</font>
</ul>
</ul>


<p><br>
<font size="+2"><li> Drug and alcohol addictions are not
incurable, progressive
diseases that usually end in death.</font><br>
And they are also not &quot;spiritual diseases.&quot;
The truth is that most people
spontaneously recover, and simply &quot;mature out of&quot; addictive
behavior.
Eventually, most of them simply get sick and tired of being sick

Alcoholics Anonymous actually teaches that alcoholics
are &quot;born that way&quot;, and have
&quot;character defects&quot; like &quot;alcoholic thinking&quot;
and &quot;reacting wrong&quot; that can be
<a href="orange-heresy.html#childhood" target="_blank">traced back to early
childhood</a>, even to a time before the alcoholic ever had his or
her first drink:<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Those who do not recover are ... men and women who are constitutionally
incapable of being honest with themselves.

<p>
A.A. co-founder Doctor Bob also declared that his alcoholism was caused by selfishness:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unfortunately for me I was the only child, which perhaps engendered the
selfishness which played such an important part in bringing on my
alcoholism.<br>

<p>
Another A.A.-promoting book declared:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...it wasn't because my wife left me that I started to drink,
or because my mother didn't love me. It was because I have always been
a potential alcoholic.&quot;<br>

<p>
So what was the real reason that guy became an alcoholic? How
about, he felt bad, and wanted to feel good?
How about, he was an abused child of an alcoholic parent,
growing up in a dysfunctional family, and that's why he was always
different, and felt different, even from early childhood?</i>

Alcoholics Anonymous is really about Alcoholics Anonymous.

Alcoholics Anonymous is also a <a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">cult
religion</a>, one that uses alcoholism as a hook to get people to join.
(The sister organization, Narcotics Anonymous, uses drug addictions
in the same manner.)
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">A.A., N.A., and all of the other
12-Step clones</a>
have the goal of getting everyone to practice
<b>&quot;The Twelve Steps&quot;</b>, which include commandments
to seek knowledge of, and carry out, the will of God,
as they
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">hear God dictating His orders</a>.
The cofounder and leader of Alcoholics Anonymous, Bill Wilson, plainly declared:
<p> 
<blockquote>

A.A. began as a branch of another cult religion called
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">The Oxford Group</a>&quot;,
which was the creation of an evil fascist renegade Lutheran minister named

Why all this insistence that every A.A. member must hit bottom first?
The answer is that few people will sincerely try to practice the A.A.
program unless they have hit bottom. For practicing A.A.'s remaining
eleven Steps means the adoption of attitudes and actions that almost
no alcoholic who is still drinking can dream of taking. Who wishes to
be rigorously honest and tolerant? &nbsp; ...<br>

Besides a seeming inability to accept much on

have been so touchy that even casual reference to
spiritual things made us bristle with antagonism. This
sort of thinking had to be abandoned. Though some of
us resisted, we found no great difficulty in casting aside
such feelings. Faced with alcoholic destruction, we
soon became as open minded on spiritual matters as
we tried to be on other questions. In this respect
alcohol was a great persuader. It finally beat us into a
state of reasonableness. Sometimes this was a tedious
process; we hope no one else will be prejudiced for as

<p>
In 1955, at the A.A. twentieth anniversary convention, Bill said of alcoholics,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
They would not stand for the rather aggressive evangelism of the Oxford Group.
And they would not accept the principle of &quot;team guidance&quot; for their
own personal lives.
It was too authoritarian for them.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;

In other respects, too, we found we had to make haste slowly.
When first contacted, most alcoholics just wanted to find
sobriety, nothing else. They clung to their other defects,
letting go only little by little.
They simply did not want to
get &quot;too good too soon.&quot;

&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
The Oxford Groups' absolute concepts  &#8212; absolute purity, absolute
honesty, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love &#8212; were frequently
too much for the drunks.

These ideas had to be fed with teaspoons
rather than by buckets.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957), pages 74-75,<br>
and<br>
<i>Not-God: A History of Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, Ernest Kurtz, page 46.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So Bill Wilson was feeding his favorite Oxford Group &quot;principles&quot;
(cult dogma) to the
new alcoholics a little bit at a time; giving them just as much
as they would tolerate, but not enough to drive them away. Bill was just
gradually converting them to his &quot;authoritarian principles&quot;.
<p>
And then Bill Wilson sang the praises of dictatorships:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Therefore we [AA] have the full benefits of the murderous political dictatorships of
today but none of their liabilities.<br>

</font>
</blockquote>

<font color="#BF0000"><i>
The full benefits of murderous dictatorships? What benefits? Benefits for whom?
And what liabilities of murderous dictatorships does Alcoholics Anonymous not have?
</i></font>


<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In A.A. there is active still another form of association, a form of which
the world is today in great doubt. It has its virtues, nevertheless,
especially for us of Alcoholics Anonymous: I am speaking of dictatorship.
In A.A. we have two dictators, and we profit and grow through both.
One is John Barleycorn, who is never very far from the elbow of each of us.
The other is the Father of Lights, who presides over all men.
God is saying to us, &quot;Learn my will and do it.&quot; And John Barleycorn is saying
to each of us, &quot;You had better do God's will or I will kill you!&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957), page 225.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note how Bill Wilson bemoaned the fact that dictatorships had gone
out of fashion. (After World War Two, the western nations had &quot;great doubts&quot;
about the &quot;virtues&quot; of dictatorships.) But Bill was a faithful keeper of
the flame &#8212; he was keeping the dream alive &#8212;
people could still &quot;grow and profit through dictators&quot; in
Alcoholics Anonymous.<br>
<font color="blue">
(Also note that in Bill Wilson's idea of a &quot;profitable dictatorship&quot;,
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#refusenik" target="_blank">Bill Wilson always got to be the dictator</a>,
and he also got
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">all of the profits, too</a>.)

<!--  ----------------------------------------------------------->


<p>
<li>
The A.A. religion pushes a concept of God that is worse than medieval.
<ul>
<li>
According to A.A., God is a fascist dictator, an
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#prayer3" target="_blank">authoritarian</a>,
vindictive Old-Testament-style patriarchal God Who
will kill you with a painful slow death by alcoholism if you don't
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">believe in Him</a>,

and
<li> <a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#daily_vision" target="_blank">Seek and Do

</ul>

<li> According to Bill Wilson,
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#lash_of_alcoholism" target="_blank">God uses &quot;the lash of alcoholism&quot;
to drive people into the A.A. religion</a>,
where they will find endless
<i>&quot;Serenity and Gratitude&quot;</i> while working as slaves of God.
</ul>

<p>
<li>
The manual of Alcoholics Anonymous is also named
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i>, but is popularly called
&quot;The Big Book&quot;.
All of Chapter Four of the <i>Big Book</i>,
<i>&quot;We Agnostics&quot;</i>,
covers just one subject:
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html" target="_blank">how all agnostics and atheists
must be converted</a> to having the same religious beliefs as the
author Bill Wilson. (It is <i>not</i> about how to quit drinking.)
Wilson actually instructed people to abandon human intelligence and
reason, and
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#abandon_reason" target="_blank">embrace blind
faith</a> in &quot;the realm of the spirit&quot;.
And then
<a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">the recruiting manual</a> in
Chapter Seven of the <i>Big Book</i> teaches that
<a href="orange-recruit.html#believer" target="_blank">other people's religions are
inferior to A.A. beliefs</a>, because
those other religions didn't keep those people from drinking.
(As if the goal of all religions is to keep people from drinking.)
<p>
<li>
The Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are not <i>&quot;spiritual principles&quot;</i>,
they are
<a href="orange-rroot810.html#Shoemaker1" target="_blank"><i>cult practices</i>
that Bill Wilson got from Dr. Frank Buchman's Oxford Groups</a>.
The Twelve Steps are a recipe for building a cult religion, not a
formula for quitting drinking:
<ul>
<li> The Twelve Steps do not even tell you to quit drinking, or to help anyone
else to quit drinking, either.
<a name="ftnt01_ret"> </a>
<li> The Twelve Steps don't even mention sobriety, recovery, or health,
but they do mention surrender to the cult, and going recruiting for the
cult, and guilt-inducing confession sessions.
<li> The 12 Steps also mention God,
directly or indirectly, in 6 of the 12 steps.
The Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian religions mention God
fewer times than that &#8212; only 4 or 5 of the 10 commandments
refer to God, directly or
indirectly<font size="-1"><sup><a href="#ftnt01">1</a></sup></font> &#8212;
but the A.A. true believers still insist that A.A. is not a religion.

<li> Seven of the 12 steps, Steps Four through Ten, are designed
to induce guilt in members by having them make long lists of
every sin they ever committed, and every fault, moral shortcoming,
and defect of character they have, and then they have to confess it
all to another member and God.
Then they make another list of
everybody they ever hurt or offended, and confess that, and try
to make amends. And then they have to repeat the whole process
again, and again, for the rest of their lives.

<!-------------------------------------------------------
Guilt induction and confession sessions
are standard tools for
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_induce_guilt" target="_blank">manipulating people's
minds and brainwashing them</a>.
(The
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Reds" target="_blank">Red Chinese used it</a>
on American and British prisoners during the Korean War, and
called it &quot;self-criticism&quot;.
They also used it on their fellow Chinese citizens during the
Cultural Revolution.)<br>

The A.A. members doing the Twelve Steps have to make long lists of
every sin they ever committed, and every fault, moral shortcoming,
and defect of character they have, and then they have to confess it
all to another member and God.
(And that member usually isn't ordained clergy or sworn to secrecy.)

Then they make another list of
everybody they ever hurt or offended, and confess that, and try
to make amends. And then they have to repeat the whole process
again, and again, for the rest of their lives.
----------------------------------------------------------->

<li> The Twelve Steps tell people to surrender their wills and their
lives to &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot; or the A.A. group,
and to pray to &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Higher Power&quot;
or the A.A. group,
and then the Twelve Steps tell people how to pray and what to pray for,
but the A.A. true believers still insist that A.A. is not a religion.

<!-------------------------------------------------------
<P>
<LI> Then the Twelve Steps tell believers to go recruit more members
by &quot;carrying the message to them&quot;,
and Bill Wilson's other scribblings also tell members that converting more
people to the A.A. religion is &quot;helping others selflessly&quot;.

<P>
<LI> The Twelve Steps are really <a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">just
a verbose restatement</a> of the cult-building practices of
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group cult religion.
Bill Wilson's Twelve Steps are not even original material.

----------------------------------------------------------->
</ul>

<p>
<li>
Twelve-Step enthusiasts declare that the Twelve Steps
will cure anybody of anything,
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">just like good old-fashioned snake oil</a>.

They claim that the Twelve Steps are equally appropriate for everybody
from alcoholics to drug addicts to gamblers, from compulsive shoppers
to emotional wrecks to rape victims, from
divorcees to diabetics, from schizophrenics to fat people.
The 12 steps really do have just as much to do with being a rape victim as
they have to do with being an alcoholic &#8212; absolutely nothing.

<p>
<center><table width="87%" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" border="3">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">
The 12-Step true believers can make such sweeping grandiose claims about the
broad applicability of the Twelve Steps because those Twelve Steps are
not really about alcoholism at all.
The Twelve Steps have absolutely nothing to do with alcoholism;
they are all about converting people to belief in a cult religion, and
then recruiting more new cult members and indoctrinating them.
That's what those practices did for their creator,
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank">Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman</a>,
and that is what they still do.

<p>
So the 12 steps really are equally applicable to everything from
drug addiction and alcoholism to compulsive shopping and being a rape victim,
because <i>The Steps</i> have nothing to do with any of those things.

</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
<li>
Even the <a href="orange-heresy.html#children" target="_blank">children of alcoholics</a>
are supposed to do the Twelve Steps in organizations like
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html#ACOA" target="_blank">
ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics),
Al-Anon, and Alateen</a>.
Obviously, the Twelve Steps can't really be a program for quitting
drinking, because those children don't drink alcohol, and they never have.
Yet the wives and children (and even close friends) of alcoholics are all
<a href="orange-recruit.html#recruit_family" target="_blank">supposed to be
indoctrinated</a> into practicing the guilt-inducing
Twelve Steps, just because
they have some relationship with an alcoholic and have supposedly been
infected with a &quot;spiritual disease&quot; called &quot;co-dependency&quot;.
</ul>

<p><br>
<font size="+2"><li> Alcoholics Anonymous meetings are not
safe havens where newcomers
will find unconditional love and acceptance, expert advice on recovery, and wise,
self-sacrificing helpers.
</font><br>

Alcoholics Anonymous meetings are ceremonies where
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_irrationality" target="_blank">irrational beliefs</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma" target="_blank">bad advice</a>

Dissenting voices and criticism of the A.A. program are not
appreciated or &quot;loved.&quot;
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">Sexual exploitation of newcomers</a>,
especially of, but not limited to, women, is also all too common.
<p>
A.A. meetings are religious rituals more than they are therapy sessions.
Every meeting is begun by reciting the contents of
pages 58 and 59 from the <i>Big Book</i>, which contain
the Twelve Steps, and statements that
everyone there got sober by doing the Twelve Steps, and that

Actually, it is A.A. that is being dishonest with itself.
Those statements are cherished religious beliefs and wishful thinking,
not facts.
The A.A. old-timers
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">have seen millions of people fail</a>
while practicing the Twelve Steps, but they just play <i>&quot;blame the victim&quot;</i>
with those failures.
<p>
A.A-founder Bill Wilson wrote many such
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#jealous" target="_blank">dishonest and grandiose things</a> in the
<i>Big Book</i>, and A.A. will not admit that those statements are
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#grand_boast" target="_blank">completely
untrue</a>, or even question or test their validity. The true
believers just go on with the ritual, and proclaim that
Bill Wilson was a genius and a saint.
<p>
The official A.A. manual that was published in 1940 declares that their attitude
towards alcoholics is:

The moment he wittingly drinks so much as a drop of beer, wine, spirits, or any other
alcoholic drink he automatically loses all status as a member of Alcoholics Anonymous.

A.A. is not interested in sobering up drunks who are not sincere in their desire to
remain completely sober for all time.<br>

<p>
So, you have no status and they are not interested in helping you if you slip, or if
you will not follow their rules exactly.
So much for the &quot;unconditional love&quot; that they brag about giving to newcomers.
<p>
<i>But why do so many
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">judges then sentence people to
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings</a> when A.A. says that it is not interested in helping them?</i>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Also notice how that statement makes Alcoholics Anonymous a cherry-picking program &#8212;
they only want the winners for members. They cannot then claim that they made the members
quit drinking, or saved their lives, or helped millions to quit drinking, or that they
have a great success rate.
A.A. only wants those people who have already
chosen to quit drinking. But that is the whole battle. Really sincerely deciding to quit
drinking forever is the most important factor in gaining and keeping sobriety.
A.A. contributed nothing to those people who have already arrived at that decision before
coming to Alcoholics Anonymous.
A.A. just takes the credit for other people's work.

<p>
The numerous A.A. horror stories show just how unsafe A.A. really is:<br>

<font size="+2"><li> Going to A.A. meetings and doing the Twelve Steps
for a few years does not necessarily make people into wise and knowledgeable
alcoholism recovery counselors, suitable to be sponsors and advise and
supervise the newcomers.</font>
<p>
Often, the program doesn't even accomplish Step Two
for the old members, &quot;restoring them to sanity.&quot;<br>
And it doesn't guarantee that they won't relapse.<br>
And it doesn't stop them from being
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#sexualpred" target="_blank">sexual predators</a> or
neurotic control freaks, either.

<p>
It is a myth that A.A. sponsors are wise and knowledgeable and able to
give sage advice. A.A. propaganda is always telling stories
about sponsors who are able to perceptively psychoanalyze their
sponsees and
always come up with just the right answer to solve the sponsees' problem
and guide him or her towards sobriety and spirituality.
That is just so much wishful thinking, and it is just another part
of the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank"><i>Big Lie</i></a>
 &#8212; part of the story that A.A. is a great treatment
program. They don't want to tell you that healthy, wealthy, and wise
people simply do not join A.A. and become sponsors. They don't want
to tell you that you are likely to get some neurotic power-tripping
fool who has simply memorized several dozen slogans, and he will
just spout one at you in every situation.

<p>
The truth is that A.A. is managed at the grass roots level by incompetents who
literally do not know what they are doing. They have no training in treating
alcoholism; they are just people who have been members of A.A. and
&quot;worked the program&quot; for a few years, and still they presume
to act as doctors, ministers, priests, and recovery counselors to the
newcomers.

&quot;Look at these people. We have thousands of

</font>
<p>
Yes, they have, together, accumulated many years of experience in drinking, but that is not the
same thing as having thousands
of years of experience in getting other people to sober up. By A.A.'s broken logic, the
best counselors would be old alcoholics who are still drinking, because they have <i>even more</i>
years of experience in drinking.)

<p>
A.A. sponsors often feel entitled to tell their sponsees not to see a doctor or get counseling
or psychiatric treatment, and to just trust the 12-Step program to heal them.
Even worse, many A.A. sponsors feel qualified to tell newcomers not to take their
doctor-prescribed medications. That has caused immense harm and grief, and even
psychotic breakdowns, hospitalizations, and deaths.

The more incompetent someone is in a particular area, the less
qualified that person is to assess anyone's skill in that space,

they have performed well. As a result, the incompetent will
tend to grossly overestimate their skills and abilities.

One of the most interesting pieces of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" target="_blank">new &quot;recovery&quot;
research</a>, from the Johns Hopkins University
School of Hygiene and Public Health, no less,
has shown that newcomers do not benefit
from getting sponsors. In a recent controlled study, a
group of new Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous
members who got sponsors did no
better than another group who didn't get sponsors. But strangely
enough, the sponsors did better than other members who did not
act as sponsors. It seems that getting their egos stroked by
acting as puffed-up,
all-wise, all-knowing sponsors, ordering the wimpy newcomers around,
helped the sponsors to stay clean and sober, even if it didn't help
the newcomers any.<br>

<p>
The use of incompetent amateur counselors has led to much suffering
and many deaths.
They are not &quot;the experts on addiction,&quot; like they claim,
and the war stories of some old alcoholics are not more valuable
than a college education and medical school:

A.A. members are not inherently qualified to work as recovery counselors,

They are not inherently qualified to decide that newcomers

medications</a> that real doctors have given them, and just trust
the Twelve Steps to heal them, but
<a href="orange-coffee.html" target="_blank">A.A. and N.A. are notorious

<p>
A friend who has been in and out of A.A. for 30 years described how

is that most people have a lot of grief in their lives and in a way,
AA is always focusing on losses. At the same time, there is nowhere
to go with grief as it isn't allowed. So the sadness gets stuffed
leaving only the anger to be dumped out in the meeting, usually aimed
at someone who isn't getting the program or was foolish enough to
tell the truth about their selfish life. Notice that sometime. Old
timers in AA are often an angry lot: a mask of serenity with a seething

Throughout the first 164 pages of the <i>Big Book</i>, Bill Wilson
raved about
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#confession_list" target="_blank">
the fantastic religious or spiritual experiences</a> that members
could expect to
get after they had practiced the Twelve Steps enough.
But members complained that they weren't getting <i>The Big Experience</i>, or seeing God,
from doing Bill's 12 Steps.
So Bill toned down the terminology to just a &quot;spiritual awakening&quot;.
And then he toned it down some more, and some more.
Eventually, the promised spiritual experience was reduced to nothing but an
&quot;educational experience&quot;.
See <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spir_experience" target="_blank">the description
of that process in the Bait-And-Switch web page</a>.

<br>
<font size="+2"><li> <a href="orange-powerless.html" target="_blank">The A.A. First Step, where
people are supposed to &quot;admit&quot; that they are &quot;powerless
over alcohol&quot;, is a hoax.</a></font>
<p>
People are not &quot;powerless&quot; over their desires to
drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, take drugs, or eat too much.
Being sick, and having a messed-up life from too much drinking, is
just that &#8212; being sick. It isn't &quot;powerlessness.&quot;
Having difficulties quitting is not &quot;powerlessness&quot;, it's
having difficulties quitting. Saying that your drinking has really
gotten out of control doesn't mean that you are powerless over it.

<p>
The &quot;powerless&quot; doctrine of Alcoholics Anonymous is one
of their most central religious beliefs.
It is one of those points where A.A. radically departs from
Christianity or any other mainstream religion of the world, and
enters the realm of
<a href="orange-heresy.html" target="_blank">bizarre cult religion</a>.
Christianity teaches people to be responsible for their actions.
So do all of the other major religions of the world.
<p>
A.A., on the other hand, teaches that people are incapable of
running their own lives and must surrender control of their lives
to the A.A. group [cult] and a &quot;Higher Power&quot; who will control
them, and do the quitting for them.
Thus A.A. is teaching the doctrine that is common to so many
cults &#8212; that
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_cant_without" target="_blank">you cannot make it without the cult</a>.
Bill Wilson wrote:
<p> 
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Remember that we deal with alcohol &#8212; cunning, baffling, powerful!

<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William Wilson, pages 58-59.</font>

<p>
Thus the real purpose of Step One is to prepare the new members for
Steps Two and Three, where they will confess that they are insane,
and then surrender their wills and lives to &quot;God as they
understand Him&quot; and Alcoholics Anonymous. That is the standard
cult demand that members
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult" target="_blank">surrender to the cult</i></a>,
pure and simple.

<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> tells us that,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
It helped me a lot to become convinced that alcoholism was a disease, not
a moral issue; that I had been drinking as a result of a compulsion,
even though I had not been aware of the compulsion at the time;
and that sobriety was not a matter of will power.<br>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
<i>Doctor, Alcoholic, Addict</i>, page 448.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the contrary, sobriety is most assuredly a matter of will power and self-control.
Nobody else is going to do the quitting for you.
Nobody else <i>CAN</i> do the quitting for you.
Nobody else is going to hold your hand every Saturday night.
<p>
But Bill Wilson kept insisting that the truth was just the opposite.
In his second book, written a dozen years later, he wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
We had approached A.A. expecting to be taught self-confidence.
Then we had been told that so far as alcohol is concerned,
self-confidence was no good whatever; in fact, it was a total
liability. Our sponsors declared that we were the victims of a
mental obsession so subtly powerful that no amount of human
willpower could break it. There was, they said, no such thing as
the personal conquest of this compulsion by the unaided will.
... It was a statistical fact that alcoholics almost never recovered
on their own resources.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William Wilson, page 22.</font>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is distortions, falsehoods, and outright lies. The true part of
that is, &quot;Yes, the sponsors did tell such falsehoods to
the newcomers.&quot;
But nobody is &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol, and will power
most assuredly <i>can</i> break the addiction, and self-confidence
is a big help.

<p>
The statement that
<font color="#4f007f"><b>&quot;It was a statistical fact that alcoholics almost never
recovered on their own resources&quot;</b></font>
is a blatant lie, for two reasons:
<ul>
<li> First off,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#notreatment" target="_blank"><i>MOST</i> of the
people who recover from alcoholism</a>, like 75 or 80 percent of them, do it alone, without A.A.
or any &quot;treatment&quot; or any &quot;group therapy&quot; program of any kind.
<a href="#Harvard_Mental">The Harvard Medical School says so</a>.
But Bill Wilson didn't want people to know that; they would realize that they don't need to be
dependent upon A.A. for their recovery.

<p><li>
The other reason that
&quot;statistical&quot; statement is a lie is more subtle:
Bill was implying that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">the A.A. way yields
a higher success rate</a> than people trying to quit drinking by themselves.
That is completely false. Bill's cult religion program had, and still has, a horrendous
failure rate. Many tests have shown that getting
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#powerless_binge" target="_blank"><i>no 'treatment'
at all</i> is better than A.A. 'treatment' or help</a>.
Fewer people die, fewer people get rearrested for public drunkenness,
and fewer people go on intense drinking binges when they don't get any Alcoholics Anonymous.
And more people quit drinking and stay quit if they don't get any Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;help&quot;.
</ul>

<p>
Bill Wilson would have been much closer to the truth if he had written,<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif"> 
&quot;It was
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">a statistical fact</a>
that alcoholics almost never recovered in Alcoholics Anonymous.
More than eighty percent of the newcomers were gone in a month;
ninety-five percent were gone in a year, ninety-nine percent were
gone in ten years.
You have no conception these days of
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">how much failure we
had.</a>&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nobody is powerless over urges, cravings, or temptations. Just
because you feel an urge or a craving doesn't mean that you have to
give in to it, and feed it.
The way to quit drinking is not to expect God to just
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#it_disappears" target="_blank">magically
remove all desire for drink</a>.
The way to quit is to just not give in to the cravings that will
inevitably come. And
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">lots of alcoholics do succeed</a>
in quitting drinking by doing just that.

<p>
<ul>
<li> A.A. begins every meeting by reciting a list of Bill Wilson's lies that declare that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">the Twelve Steps work great</a>,
and that failures only happen because
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">alcoholics are bad people</a>,

<p>
<li> When A.A. says &quot;Keep An Open Mind,&quot; what they really
mean is &quot;Keep A Closed Mind&quot;, and blindly refuse to see anything
wrong with <i>&quot;The Program&quot;</i>, A.A. beliefs, or the crazy teachings of
Bill Wilson.
<p>

<li> When A.A. says &quot;Keep An Open Mind,&quot;, what they really
mean is,<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Stay Gullible, and believe whatever we tell you.
Heck, it <i>might</i> be true; you never know.&quot;</font>
<p>
The only idea that they
really want you to be open to is the idea that A.A. is right about
everything &#8212; the idea that the &quot;spiritual&quot; A.A. program with
its Twelve Steps is a really good cure for alcoholism, one that actually works.

<p>
<li> <a href="orange-recruit.html" target="_blank">A.A. practices deceptive recruiting</a>.
It hides its extreme religiosity from new prospects, the
&quot;babies&quot; and &quot;pigeons&quot;.
The <i>Big Book</i> recruiting manual, chapter seven,
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#arouse_prejudice1" target="_blank">specifically
instructs</a> recruiters not to emphasize the religious element of the
program.
Bill Wilson's other writings tell recruiters to reveal the
truth to the prospects and newcomers only a little bit at a time,
doling out the truth by <i>&quot;<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#teaspoons" target="_blank">Teaspoons,
Not Buckets</a>.&quot;</i>


<p>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_dishonesty" target="_blank">A.A. falsifies its history</a>.
A.A. has been doing that since the very beginning, when Bill Wilson hid
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">the Oxford Group roots</a> of A.A..
<p>
<li> A.A. is <a href="orange-spirrel.html" target="_blank">a dishonest religion that
says that it isn't a religion</a> while it
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#undercut" target="_blank">back-stabs and undercuts the
other religions</a>.
<p>
<li> Like most cult religions,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_group_think" target="_blank">A.A. practices
&quot;Group-Think&quot;</a>, and forbids
any criticism of &quot;the program.&quot;
That is just the opposite of <i>rigorous honesty</i>.
Like most cults, A.A. believes that it has
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_dogma" target="_blank">unquestionable truths</a>,
even <a href="orange-cult_a0.html#God_given" target="_blank">God-given truths</a>,
so it considers any criticism of its founders, their teachings, or the
organization to be invalid &#8212; automatically invalid and untrue, because
their truths are God-given.
<p>
<li>
Thus,
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_personal_attacks" target="_blank">A.A. calls its critics
&quot;AA-bashers&quot;</a>
(<a href="orange-propaganda.html#hominem" target="_blank"><i>ad hominem</i></a>),
and imagines that everything &quot;AA-bashers&quot; say is always wrong,
and can be dismissed out-of-hand, because they are just AA-bashers.
By this circular logic, A.A. can never be wrong, and criticism
of A.A. can never be correct. And the true believers can avoid having
to think, or take any criticism of A.A. seriously.
<p>
<li>
A.A. also enforces the Group-Think in another way:
<a href="orange-letters241.html#John_McC" target="_blank">they will delist
any group whose meetings do not conform to the standard formula to the
satisfaction of the central-office elders</a>.
That means that the non-conforming
group gets no referrals from the central office hot-line, and
it isn't listed on the lists of meetings, and it doesn't get found
by visitors or prospective new members, and it is just generally
shunned. The group just gets cast into limbo. That threat
is generally enough to enforce conformity.

<p>
<li> I shouldn't have to be writing all of this stuff, these
<i><b>&quot;Orange Papers&quot;</b></i>. If A.A.
were really <i>&quot;a manner of living which demands rigorous
honesty&quot;</i> like they brag (in the Big Book, page 58), then they
would have written and printed all of this information themselves,
many, many years ago, just so that everyone would know what
the real truth is. Instead, the A.A. headquarters keeps the archives
of old documents and records sealed, locked up,
so that no investigative journalists or snoopy scholars can learn the truth.
They wouldn't even let the NBC News or ABC News teams take a look in the archives.
<p>
And now Susan Cheever, who was allowed into the archives so she could write
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Cheever" target="_blank">a fawning uncritical
hero-worshipping biography</a> of A.A. founder Bill Wilson, reports that
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#Cheever5" target="_blank">the A.A. headquarters is
&quot;excising&quot; from the official Alcoholics Anonymous archives
all of the embarrassing information</a> about Bill Wilson's
sexual exploitation of women newcomers to Alcoholics Anonymous.
That sure as heck isn't &quot;rigorous honesty&quot;.

<font color="black">
Bill Wilson was all mixed up:
<ul>
<li>
Natural desires do not supply us with
&quot;satisfactions or pleasures&quot;.
Natural desires are an itch,
an urge, to go get some satisfactions or pleasures.
Hunger, for instance, does not give us pleasure. It gives us a big pain
in the belly that drives us to go find something to eat.

<p>
<li>
Instincts are urges to do things like eat, survive, have sex,
and care for our young.
Such urges are extremely intense, because that's what works to keep the
species from going extinct. (See the definition of &quot;instinct&quot;
<a href="orange-definitions.html#instinct2" target="_blank">here</a>.)

<p>
<li>
<font color="blue">
But there is no &quot;instinct&quot; to drink ethyl alcohol or get high on drugs.
</font>
<p>
<li>
You do not voluntarily chose to get hungry,
crave sex, feel a drive to survive, or wish to care for your young.
You do not allow those &quot;desires&quot; to &quot;far exceed their intended purpose.&quot;
You are driven by very strong compulsions to do what is necessary
for survival and reproduction. That's just life,
keeping life going, no matter what...
<p>
<li> According to Bill Wilson, God is a poor bio-engineer whose
designs for instincts and desires are malfunctioning badly. They aren't
working as He intended, and we aren't working as He intended.
Gee, we aren't getting our wishes granted; God isn't getting His wishes granted;
nobody is happy. It looks like <i>The Creative Spirit Of The Universe</i> really
screwed up this time.

Bill continued his attack on the stereotypical alcoholics:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Selfishness &#8212; self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root
of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion,
self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows
and they retaliate. &nbsp; ...<br>
... the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though
he usually doesn't think so.<br>

<a name="defective_relations"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Since defective relations with other human beings have nearly
always been the immediate cause of our woes, including our
alcoholism, no field of investigation could yield more
satisfying and valuable rewards than this one.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>, William Wilson, page 81.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
So now alcoholism is caused by &quot;defective relations&quot;?
Earlier, Bill Wilson declared that our self-destructive drinking
<a href="#cause_list">was caused by</a> our sins,
moral shortcomings, defects of character, resentments,
instincts run wild, instinct gone astray,
self-will run riot, self-seeking, selfishness,
desires that far exceed their intended purpose,
and failure to practice religious precepts properly.
What will it be next?
</font>


<p><br>
<font color="black">
People do not drink too much because
they have big puffed-up strutting-peacock egos,
or because they think they are the center of the Universe,
or because they think they are too big and too good to need God,
like Bill Wilson said.</font>
<p>
And people do not drink too much because they are examples of instincts
run wild, or self-will run riot, or because they are sinners with moral
shortcomings and character defects, like Bill Wilson said.
<p>
People usually drink too much because they feel bad and are
trying to feel good. They are often miserable, and just trying to
&quot;have fun.&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue">
Just because alcoholics and drug addicts have brains that are deficient in
L-dopamine or beta endorphins doesn't mean that they are all
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">selfish, immoral, and
unspiritual</a></font>, like Bill Wilson said.

<p>
Forty percent of all alcoholics and drug addicts were abused children
who are now just trying to cope with their mangled emotional lives,
damaged personalities, and
<a href="orange-ratpark.html#vermis" target="_blank">shriveled cerebellar vermises</a>.
In addition, many more alcoholics and drug
addicts suffer from emotional or mental illnesses that they are trying
to fix by self-medicating. And there are even more people who are sick
and in pain from physical illnesses, and they are just trying to kill
their pain with drugs and alcohol. And last but not least, there are
alcoholics who smoke and drink to kill the pain of being
very sick from having
drunk too much alcohol and smoked too many cigarettes for far too long.
<p>

The numbers look like this:
<ul>
<li> Forty percent of all alcoholics and junkies were abused children.
Sometimes the parents were alcoholics, sometimes dopers,
sometimes just insane. Sometimes insane vicious religious nuts, or insane
cruel alcoholic military sergeant fathers.
Sometimes insane first, and then they used alcohol or dope to
kill the pain of their insanity.
Often, those abusive parents had been abused children themselves,
and they were just passing it on. For whatever reason, they then abused
their children, physically, or mentally, or both, and the
children responded by using alcohol or dope to kill their own
pain.
<li> And, in addition, at least half of the people in prison for
violent crimes were also abused children.
Perhaps it's much worse than that &#8212; according to one survey,
85% of all violent prison inmates were abused in childhood.
<li> Two-thirds of all teenage mothers were raped or sexually
abused as children or teenagers.
<li> Rape victims are ten times more likely than other women
to use drugs and alcohol to excess.
<li> In the U.S., at least one in ten women have been raped,
almost two-thirds before the age of eighteen.
<li> A recent survey reports that one-sixth of all rape victims
reported to police are under the age of 12. (And this is the
category of rape least likely to be reported.)
One-fifth of these girls were raped by their fathers.
They have been betrayed.
</ul>

<p>
Trying to make those people quit drinking or drugging by crushing
their egos and making them feel guilty doesn't work, and usually
does more harm than good. (They will just get stoned again, trying to
obliterate the feelings of guilt and get back to feeling good.
It is neither an accident nor a coincidence that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">involvement with
Alcoholics Anonymous was seen to <i>increase</i>, not reduce,
binge drinking</a>.)

<p>
<br>
<font size="+2"><li> There is no simple one-size-fits-all
cure for alcoholism.</font>
<p>
There is no panacea. There is no magic bullet. Mere sobriety will not
solve all of your problems and give you boundless happiness.
It will solve one <i>huge</i> problem, but you will still have lots of
other smaller problems, because real life isn't so simple or so easy.

Ebby Thacher caught Bill Wilson
<a href="orange-rroot780.html#Ebby_Thacher" target="_blank">at a weak, vulnerable
moment in the hospital</a>,
while Bill was detoxing and totally out of his head from alcohol withdrawal
and hallucinogenic drugs, and convinced Bill that Frank Buchman's Oxford
Group cult had a simple program that would be the answer to all
of his problems.

<p>
<a name="solve_all"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

Chapter 1, <i>Bill's Story</i>, page 13.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alas, it ain't necessarily so.
There is no simple panacea that will solve all of your problems.
Bill's insistence that twelve simple steps are
the answer to all of your problems is childishly simplistic
thinking, outright lunacy:
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles
would solve all my problems.&quot;</i><br>
</font>

</blockquote>
<p>
Nevertheless, in spite of all sanity and common sense,
Bill Wilson insisted that his version of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman's cult religion</a> was
<i>The Big Answer</i> to all of an alcoholic's problems:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You say, &quot;...I know I must get along without liquor,
but how can I? Have you a sufficient substitute?&quot;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that. It is a
fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous. There you will find release
from care,
boredom and worry. Your imagination will be fired. Life will mean
something at last. The most satisfactory years of your existence lie
ahead. Thus we find the fellowship, and so will you.<br>
 ...<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It may seem incredible that these men are to become happy, respected, and
useful once more. How can they rise out of such misery, bad repute and
hopelessness? The practical answer is that since these things have
happened among us, they can happen with you. Should you wish them above
all else, and be willing to make use of our experience, we are sure they
will come. The age of miracles is still with us. Our own recovery proves
that!<br>
 ... <br>
See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great
events will come to pass for you
and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us.<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">Abandon yourself to God
as you understand God</a>. Admit your faults
to Him and to your fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your

meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.<br>

<p>
And just what is the magic ingredient in Bill Wilson's cure for alcoholism?
It is to confess your sins, <i>all of your sins</i>, every last
little detail, to &quot;God and another human being&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
We pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every twist of character,
every dark cranny of the past.
Once we have taken this step, withholding nothing, we are delighted.
We can look the world in the eye.
We can be alone at perfect peace and ease.
Our fears fall from us.
We begin to feel the nearness of our Creator.
We may have had certain spiritual beliefs, but now we begin
to have a spiritual experience.
The feeling that the drink problem has disappeared will often
come strongly.
We feel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with
the Spirit of the Universe.<br></font>

Chapter 6, <i>Into Action</i>, page 75.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue"><i>Bill Wilson was delusional.</i></font>


<p>
<br>
<font size="+2"><li>
You can't just make up any kind of a &quot;Higher Power&quot;
or &quot;god&quot; you want, and then worship it like some Golden
Calf, and expect it to perform miracles for you and grant all of
your wishes, including making you quit drinking.
That is the worst kind of superstition and idolatry.
</font>
<p>
Nevertheless, that is just what Bill Wilson preached:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Despite the living example of my friend [a sober Ebby Thacher]
there remained in me the vestiges of my old prejudice. The
word God still aroused a certain antipathy. When the thought was
expressed that there might be a God personal to me this feeling
was intensified. I didn't like the idea. I could go for such conceptions
as Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind or Spirit of Nature but
I resisted the thought of a Czar of the Heavens, however loving
His sway might be. I have since talked with scores of men who felt
the same way.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said,
<i>&quot;Why don't you choose your own conception of God?&quot;</i><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
That statement hit me hard. It melted
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">the
icy intellectual mountain</a>
in whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years.
I stood in the sunlight at last.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>It was only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power
greater than myself. Nothing more was required of me to make my
beginning.</i> I saw that growth could start from that point.
Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what
I saw in my friend. Would I have it? Of course I would!<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thus was I convinced that God is concerned with us humans
when we want Him enough. At long last I saw, I felt, I believed.
Scales of pride and prejudice fell from my eyes. A new world
came into view.<br>

<i>&quot;I can choose any conception of God I wish.<br>
I can make God in my own image.<br>
It is only necessary that I believe whatever I wish to believe.<br>
Upon that simple beginning, I can build a whole new theology.<br>
Will it work? Of course it will, because I wish it to!<br>
Oh happy day! The scales are falling from my eyes.
My prejudices are gone! I can see The Promised Land
clearly now!<br>
I am convinced that God will be concerned about me, and take care of me,
and grant all of my wishes, because I want Him to.&quot;</i>

Yes, Bill Wilson was stone crazy.</i></font>

<p>
And Bill was lying when he talked about
his &quot;icy intellectual mountain&quot;. That was
<a href="orange-religious_faith.html#Bills_education" target="_blank">just another phony act</a>
that Bill Wilson put on.
Bill Wilson was a superstitious flunk-out, not an icy intellectual.

<p>
Lastly, claiming that you are going to &quot;Turn It Over To God&quot; and
&quot;Let Go and Let God&quot; is just a cop-out that makes matters worse.
Abdicating personal responsibility for your actions, and just
&quot;Depending on a Higher Power&quot; to solve your problems for you guarantees failure,
because &quot;God&quot; is not going to do your work for you. And neither will Santa Claus or Cinderella's Fairy
Godmother. 
And that is just one more of A.A.'s dirty little secrets.

Four or five of the Ten Commandments mention God:
Which it is depends on the &quot;Honor thy mother and father&quot;
commandment.
That wording doesn't mention God.
But the original text in the Bible, in the book of Exodus, chapter
20, does. The modern translation reads: &quot;Respect your father
and your mother, and you will live a long time in the land I am
giving you.&quot; The speaker is God, so that commandment indirectly
refers to God.

in here, including chapter 16, which describes Bill's spook sessions
and s&eacute;ances, talking with the spirits of the dead, and communicating
with spirits through spirit rapping and the Ouija board. See pages 275

<i>Bill W. A Biography of Alcoholics Anonymous Cofounder Bill Wilson</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  Francis Hartigan<br>
Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin's Press, 175 Fifth Avenue,
New York, NY 10010, 2000.<br>
ISBN 0-312-20056-0<br>
Dewey: B W11h 2000<br>
This biography was written by Lois Wilson's private secretary,
Francis Hartigan.

<i>Bill W.</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Robert Thomsen<br>
Harper &amp; Rowe, New York, 1975.<br>
ISBN 0-06-014267-7<br>
Dewey call number 362.29 W112t<br>
This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is
very positively slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author
knew Mr. Wilson and worked beside him for the last 12 years
of Mr. Wilson's life. And rumor has it that this book was prepared
from autobiographical tapes that Bill Wilson made before he died.
So expect it to praise Mr. Wilson a lot.
Still, this book will also tell you about some of Bill Wilson's
warts, his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his
years-long &quot;dry drunks&quot;...

<i>Bill W. My First 40 Years</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp;
'An Autobiography By The Cofounder of Alcoholics Anonymous'<br>
(This is Bill Wilson's alleged 'autobiography', supposedly published
anonymously.)<br>

ISBN 1-56838-373-8<br>
Dewey call number B W11w 2000<br>
This book was reputedly assembled by ghost writers at Hazelden
from the same set of autobiographical tapes of Bill Wilson that Robert
Thomsen used for his book.

<i>Bill W. and Mr. Wilson &#8212; The Legend and Life of A.A.'s
Cofounder</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Matthew J. Raphael<br>
University of Massachusetts Press, Amherst, Mass., 2000.<br>
ISBN 1-55849-245-3<br>
Dewey: B W11r 2000<br>
This book was written by another stepper &#8212; the name 'Matthew Raphael' is a pen name &#8212; 
and it generally praises Bill Wilson and recites the party line about most things,
but it also contains a bunch of surprises,
like detailing Bill's sexual infidelities, his and Bob's spook sessions &#8212; talking
to the 'spirits' in s&eacute;ances through the use of Ouija boards, spirit rapping,
clairvoyance, and channeling, LSD use, and publicity-hound megalomania.

Dewey: 362.2/9286 or 362.29286 K87 1979<br>
This is a very pro-A.A., toe-the-party-line history of Alcoholics Anonymous,
but it is still a valuable resource for a wealth of historical facts and
details.

The book is a veiled AA-pusher. It purports to be a fair, balanced,
general-purpose recovery book, but it keeps coming back to saying that
A.A., Al-Anon, and the Twelve Steps are
<a href="#Mooney">the answer</a>.
