For more information on Frank Buchman, and his connection to
Alcoholics Anonymous, as
well as the many other problems with A.A., read the first
chapters of the following three excellent books:

<p><br>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous: Cult or Cure?</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Charles Bufe,
1998.<br>
See Sharp Press, PO Box 1731, Tucson AZ 85702-1731<br>
ISBN: 1-884365-12-4<br>
Dewey: 362.29286 B929a 1998<br>
(This is the second edition; it has noticeably more information
than the first edition.)

<p><br>
<i>More Revealed: A Critical Analysis of Alcoholics Anonymous and
the Twelve Steps</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ken Ragge, 1992.<br>
ALERT! Publishing, P.O. Box 50233, Henderson, Nevada 89016-0233<br>
The first chapter of <i>More Revealed</i>, which
specifically covers Frank Buchman and
the earliest days of A.A., is available free on the Internet,
at<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160702100748/http://www.morerevealed.com/">

<i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i><br>
(written by William G. Wilson and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#TomP">Tom Powers</a>,
published as 'anonymous'.)<br>
Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. New York, NY, 2000.<br>
ISBN: 0-916856-06-2<br>
Dewey: 362.2928 T969 1965<br>
This is one of the most insane and vicious books around.
It is right down there with <i>Mein Kampf</i> as far as its
ratio of lies to truth, and
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book">
hate content</a>, is concerned.
It is ostensibly Bill Wilson's
explanation of his Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, but it
is really
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#darkness">something quite
dark and evil</a>, Bill Wilson's poisonous contempt for
human nature masquerading as spirituality. It was written
while Wilson was in the middle of his eleven-year-long bout of deep
clinical depression, and it shows.
It is really a brutal, hateful assault on the character of
people who happen to have a drinking problem.
Bill Wilson hated himself and his own character flaws, so he
projected
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#second_book">all of his
own weaknesses and character flaws</a> onto the alcoholics
around him, and also onto a mythical stereotypical alcoholic,
and then said,
<font color="#4f007f">&quot;Look at him.
Look at how disgusting he is. We are all like that.&quot;</font>
This whole book is non-stop guilt induction.

<p><br>
<i>Lois Remembers: Memoirs of the Co-Founder of Al-Anon and Wife of the
Co-Founder of Alcoholics Anonymous</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Lois Wilson<br>
Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. 1991.<br>
ISBN: 0-910034-23-0<br>
Lois' book is pretty pathetic:
it was probably ghost-written for her, somebody else putting
words into
her mouth, yet again, because it came out
in 1979, long after Bill's death, when she was also very
old and frail. The <i>Lois Remembers</i> book parrots much of
the standard party line in the <i>Big Book</i>, including the
&quot;jealous of God and A.A.&quot; story:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Slowly I recognized that because I had not been able
to &quot;cure&quot; Bill of his alcoholism, I
resented the fact that someone else had done so,
and I was jealous of his newfound friends...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
God, through the Oxford Group, had accomplished in a twinkling
what I had failed to do in seventeen years.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"> &#8212; <i>Lois Remembers</i>, page 99.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That book doesn't say a word about Lois being angry with Bill for refusing
to get a job (leaving her to support the family), and just spending all of his time
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#going_insane">going to A.A. meetings</a>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html">chain-smoking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html">philandering</a>.

Dewey: 362.292 SM52C or 362.2923<br>

LCCN: 92-64114<br>
Two children of Doctor Bob describe an alcoholic father who
created a dysfunctional family.<br>
Doctor Bob pressured his daughter Sue to spurn her high-school
sweetheart and marry A.A. number four,
Ernie Galbraith. The marriage was a disaster, because Ernie was
habitually unfaithful (just like Bill Wilson), and relapsed often.
Ernie's story was quietly removed from the second edition of
the <i>Big Book</i> in 1955, but she didn't get to divorce Ernie
until 1965. Then she finally married Ray Windows, her old high-school sweetheart.

Harper &amp; Rowe, New York, 1975.<br>
ISBN: 0-06-014267-7<br>
Dewey: 362.29 W112t<br>
This is a good biography of William G. Wilson, even if it is very positively
slanted towards Mr. Wilson, because the author knew Mr. Wilson and worked
beside him for the last 12 years of Mr. Wilson's life.
This book will still tell you about some of Bill Wilson's warts,
his fat ego, his publicity-hound behavior, and his years-long
&quot;dry drunks&quot;...

<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; William G. Wilson<br>

ISBN: 0-91-685602-X<br>
LC: HV5278 .A78A4<br>
Dewey: 178.1 A1c<br>
This is Bill Wilson's version of the history of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-aacoa.html">It suspiciously differs from known history</a>
here and there.

LCCN: 84-072766<br>
LC: HV5032.W19P37x 1984<br>
Dewey: 362.29/286/O92<br>
This is the official, council-approved version of the history
of Alcoholics Anonymous.  A lot of it is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#out_of_context">lies and distortions</a>
and re-writing history, and Bill Wilson's tall tales.
Strangely enough, there is also some very interesting stuff
in here, including chapter 16, which describes
<a href="orange-heresy.html#dabble_occult">Bill's spook sessions
and s&eacute;ances</a>, talking with
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Nantucket">the spirits
of the dead</a>, and communicating
with spirits through spirit rapping and the Ouija board. See pages 275

Don't confuse this pamphlet with the above book. This is just
a short piece of 12-Step propaganda from Hazelden,
16 pages of advice on how to do Step Twelve.

This is Bill Wilson's autobiography, supposedly published anonymously.
It was assembled by Hazelden ghost writers from a set of autobiographical

<i>Slaying The Dragon: The History of Addiction Treatment and Recovery
in America</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; William L. White<br>

ISBN: 0-938475-07-X<br>

LCCN: 98-11879<br>
Dewey: 362.29'18'0973&#8212;dc21 or 362.291809 WHI<br>
This book is a mixed product.
The beginning, the history of early alcoholism treatment is excellent.
And the ending chapters, on the various alcoholism treatment programs,
are informative.
But the chapters on Alcoholics Anonymous (15 to 18) and the
chapters on Hazelden and the &quot;Minnesota Model&quot;
are just reprints of the standard A.A. P.R. handouts.
The strongest criticism of A.A. that the author can
muster is asking whether it will work as well for women and racial minoritites
as it does with white men,
without ever having established that it works on white men.
(That's the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume"><i>Assuming The Major Premise</i></a>.)
In fact, he dodges the whole question of the effectiveness of A.A. treatment
by saying that A.A. isn't a treatment program, and A.A. doesn't keep
records (page 176).
Still, this book is required reading for the serious student of
alcoholism and its treatment.<br>

<i>On the Tail of a Comet; The Life of Frank Buchman; A Small Town American Who
Awakened The Conscience Of The World</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Garth Lean<br>
Helmers &amp; Howard, Colorado Springs, CO 80933, 1988.<br>
Originally published in Great Britain by Constable and Co. Ltd. under the
title <i>Frank Buchman, A Life</i>, 1985.<br>
ISBN: 0-939443-07-4<br>
LC: BJ10.M6B834 1988<br>
Dewey: B Bu853L<br>
LCCN: 87-32740<br>
This book is a total white-wash of Frank Buchman, and large parts of it
are complete fabrications, like the author's account of how Buchman
tried to warn America about the dangers of fascism and Hitler
before World War II, rather than actually praising and admiring Hitler,
which Buchman really did.<br>

<a href="orange-rroot930.html#Garth_Lean">a review of the book here</a>.

LC: BV3785.B8 or BJ10.M6B834 1985<br>
Dewey: B Bu853L or 269.20924<br>
This book is the same as the one above,
<i>On the Tail of a Comet, The Life of Frank Buchman</i>.
This appears to be an identical printing, just done in Great Britain
and released with a different title
(the same text is on the same-numbered pages).

<i>Remaking the World</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Frank N. D. Buchman<br>
Robert M. McBride &amp; Company, New York, 1949.<br>
LC: BJ10M6B8<br>
Dewey: 170 B919r<br>
This is the collected speeches and sermons of Frank Buchman, probably
the single most complete collection of the thoughts and statements of
Buchman.

<i>Frank Buchman As I Knew Him</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; H. W. 'Bunny' Austin<br>
Grosvenor Books, London, 1975.<br>
ISBN 0-901269-16-6<br>
Dewey: 248.2 Au76<br>
Another grovelling true believer praises Frank Buchman. Bunny Austin was
the former famous Davis Cup tennis player (and
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#Bunny_Austin_1">draft dodger</a>)
whom Buchman used as a decoration
at so many Oxford Group house parties and conventions.

<p><br>
<i>The Message of Frank Buchman</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; R. C. Mowat
(Formerly Scholar of Hertford College, Oxford; Lecturer in History,
Royal Naval College, Greenwich)<br>
Blandford Press, London, 1951.<br>
If it was printed by Blandford Press, you know it's pro-MRA propaganda,
and this small 58-page booklet is no exception.
It only uses eight other MRA books for its source material.
It abounds with such double-talk as, &quot;Moral Re-Armament is the
ideology of inspired democracy&quot; (page 14) without seeing any problem
with the total lack of elections in MRA &#8212; nobody ever elected Frank Buchman
or any of the other leaders of the Oxford Group or MRA. To the Buchmanites,
absolute dictatorships were &quot;inspired democracy&quot;.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The back cover sums up the author's attitude:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
After more than 6,000 years of development, civilization is faced
with collapse. The only alternative to catastrophe, barbarism and
a Dark Age &#8212; possibly to the extinction of mankind &#8212; would seem to
be the coming of a type of society more advanced than civilization
as we know it. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The author maintains that significant experiments in building such
a society have taken place during the last 2,000 years.
He traces their effect on the social relations and culture of the
world around, and concludes that there is a pattern of society which
could be carried into effect by a 'creative minority' with a global
strategy and the necessary dynamism to overcome the challenge of
materialistic totalitarian forces.
The author believes that an examination of the world scene reveals
that through Moral Re-Armament this is already taking place.<br>

from Jesus Chist.

Herford College, Oxford University, Oxford, U.K., year unknown, probably late 1920's or
early 1930's.<br>

<i>Frank Buchman's Secret</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Peter Howard</br>

Peter Howard was
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9">the British fascist</a> who took over
the leadership of Moral
Re-Armament after Frank Buchman died. As you can imagine, he was
a true believer, and had nothing but praise for Frank Buchman and his cult.
This book is some of the most outrageous and grandiose propaganda that
you will find &#8212; cult propaganda written by one of the cult leaders.

Pure Buchmanite propaganda. Really crazy, perverted and hateful stuff that even tells us that
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#Campbell_Howard_02">married couples
should not 'indulge' in making love or having sex</a> (except to create
children).
In this book Peter Howard explains and rationalizes Buchman's odd theology like the Four Absolutes,
and then praises Frank Buchman and Moral Re-Armament,
and then gives us some anti-Communist and anti-labor arguments,
and then gives a few proof-by-anecdote stories
like the conversion of Bill Pickle the Bootlegger into <i>Bill the Bootlicker</i>
&#8212; &quot;The Making of a Miracle&quot;.
This book actually purports to teach us how to diagnose
&quot;the sexually driven&quot; &#8212; both heterosexual and homosexual.

Peter Howard is the man who took over leadership of the
Moral Re-Armament organization after Frank Buchman's death.
As you can imagine, he has nothing but praise for Buchmanism.
This is a collection of his speeches on a variety of subjects,
ranging from religion to anti-Communism.

LCCN: 67-20414<br>
Dewey: 248 E62m<br>
More pure propaganda from a couple of life-long members of Frank Buchman's cult.
Basil Entwistle was a British draft dodger who came to the USA to avoid
the British draft during World War II, and John McCook Roots was the son
of Bishop Logan Roots, who threw Frank Buchman out of China in the
nineteen-twenties, only to later become a true believer convert to
Buchmanism.<br>
Pace Publications was the publishing house of MRA in the USA.<br>
Still, this book contains some interesting
history, including a selection of speeches by Frank Buchman and Peter Howard,
both of whom had died by the time this book was written.
This book also covers the last days of the cult, including the
<i>Sing Out</i> and <i>Up With People</i> productions.

An unpublished term paper for a Moral Theology class, May 19, 1968.<br>
I question some of the author's assumptions about how Moral Re-Armament was okay with
the Catholic Church. In particular, he states that he wrote to the office
of Bishop Noa of Marquette (Detroit, Michigan, USA),
about the Bishop's criticism of MRA
(published <a href="orange-rroot990.html#Bishop_Marquette">here</a>),
and was told that the Bishop had changed his mind completely and that MRA was
okay now. Excuse me, but the Bishop of Marquette cannot change the Pope's
mind for him. It was a <i>Vatican ban</i> on MRA, not the Bishop's ban.<br>

Dewey: 248.25 D831<br>
This is a great book, one of the most detailed, well-documented,
and complete sources of information about Frank Buchman and
his religious movement. And it is easy, fascinating reading,
written by a fellow who didn't pull his punches when criticizing
Buchman. It was written by Tom Driberg, a fellow who was a colorful
personality in his own right, starting as a newspaper reporter
in London, and then becoming one of the first openly-gay Members of
Parliament in history.
And on top of that, he joined the Communist Party in Britain in the 1930s,
and when he grew disgusted with it and was going to quit, was recruited as
an agent by the British secret intelligence service, MI5, to spy on the
Communists, which he did until his cover was blown in 1946 and the Communist
Party kicked him out.
In the early nineteen-sixties, the London
publishing house of Secker &amp; Warburg asked Driberg to do a book
on Buchman and the MRA, since he had previously reported on them.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Harold Begbie<br>
G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, The Knickerbocker Press, 1923.<br>
Dewey: 248 B41m<br>
This book fawns over and glorifies Dr. Frank Buchman as a religious leader.
For some strange reason, perhaps a conceit of modesty, Frank Buchman is never
explicitly named; he is always referred to as &quot;F.B.&quot;.
This book is basically a collection of stories of Frank Buchman making converts.
As a historical document, it does give a peek into another world.

&nbsp; &nbsp; C. Irving Benson<br>
Humphrey Milford Oxford University Press, Cathedral Buildings, Melbourne, Australia, 1936.<br>
Dewey: 248 B47<br>
This is a very pro-Buchman book. It is practically a how-to manual
for Buchmanism. As such, it sometimes degenerates into absurdity and
double-talk, like this footnote on page 45. After asking,
&quot;Are absolute love, purity, honesty, and unselfishness possible?&quot;,
Benson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
There is no need to raise questions of metaphysics or philosophy
and argue about the word 'absolute,' the real meaning of which
nobody knows. 'Absolute' is used by the Group in the practical
sense and means 'perfect.'<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Funny, but all of my dictionaries know what the word &quot;absolute&quot;
means...
And it's odd that the author thinks that &quot;perfect&quot; is
more practical and attainable than &quot;absolute.&quot;
The author overlooks the fact that both &quot;absolute&quot; and
&quot;perfect&quot; are both
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_perfection">ridiculous cultish demands
for super-human perfection</a>.

anew. Every upsurge of spiritual life in the history of Christianity
has been the rediscovery and re-emphasis of neglected truths.<br>

The author tries to present a fair and objective description of
Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group Movement. He does a fair job of it.
He really minimized incidents like Buchman's getting kicked out
of Princeton, praise for Hitler and the Nazis, appeasement of Hitler,
and draft-dodging by Oxford Group members, but still, he gives a pretty
good history.

Group Movement</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Allan W. Eister<br>
Duke University Press, Durham, North Carolina, 1950.<br>
LC: BV4915 .E35<br>
My over-all impression of this otherwise fine book is that the author pulls
his punches. The entire <i>&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like
Adolf Hitler&quot;</i>
flap is reduced to a footnote in fine print at the bottom of
page 187, and is introduced only as a hearsay note, that
Reinhold Niebuhr had written, in a <i>Christian Century</i> article,
about a newsman writing about an interview with Buchman
&quot;in which the latter is reported to have said&quot;...
That was the only mention of Hitler or the Nazis that I could find
in the whole book. While the facts seem generally true and accurate,
and even plentiful,
I couldn't escape the feeling that a lot of negative (towards Buchman)
stuff was left out. The index actually has no entry for Adolf Hitler,
Nazism, the Nazi Party, fascism, or even Germany.
However, when former President Herbert Hoover spoke briefly and informally
at an MRA luncheon,
December 10 or 11, 1938, saying that he believed in 'ethics and morality',
we learn about that in larger type (pages 48 &amp; 49).
And yes, ex-President Herbert Hoover is listed in the index,
with four entries. Hmmm...

LC: BJ10 .M6W5 1955<br>
Excellent. Recommended. Good history. Extensive, fair, even-handed, and sane.
The author was right there, doing a first-hand investigation
of the Oxford Group &#8212; a.k.a. Moral Re-Armament &#8212;
in both London and Caux, Switzerland. Obviously, this book only
covers up to 1954, but that is the vast majority of the Oxford Groups /
MRA period. The author gives several revealing glimpses into the cult
mind-set, like when, on page 139, he reads
from the writings of Benjamin Franklin,
to some MRA members,
that old Ben had advocated an international
moral organization much like
MRA, and the MRA members just gave him blank looks, and<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Much to my
surprise, there was no great show of interest in this disclosure that
a great figure in American history had undoubtedly thought of
'Moral Re-Armament' nearly two hundred years ago. Apparently for
them there was no prophet but Frank Buchman!&quot;<br>

Very interesting. Another critical analysis of the theology of Buchman.
In the introduction, Herbert Dunelm, the Bishop of Durham,
finds three faults in Buchmanism:
<ol>
<li> It ignores the demands of the intellect in the high matter of religion.
(page 3).
<li> The Movement is too closely bound to the moods and claims of
Adolescence (page 6).
<li> The conception of Christianity which Groupism presents is far too
meagre and limited (page 10).

Fellow and Chaplain of Lincoln College, Oxford<br>
The MacMillan Company, New York, 1933.<br>
LC: A427 232<br>
This is the theology of the Oxford Group Movement, by the same Geoffrey Allen
as who contributed to the previous book. Rev. Allen was a leader and a
true believer in the Oxford Group Movement. This is some very twisted theology;
a radical departure from mainstream Christianity.
It attempts to explain and rationalize all of the practices of the Oxford
Groups, like receiving Guidance and &quot;sharing&quot; sins with others
who are not priests or ministers.
See quotes <a href="orange-rroot090.html#Geoffrey_Allen_1">here</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Allen also told people who were <i>under the Guidance of God</i>
to be ready to break appointments

something else instead. See quote <a href="orange-rroot090.html#break_appointments">here</a>.

A tiny 15-page booklet that is another critical examination of the

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;There is some danger that the Christian conception
of prayer as a solemn act of communication between man and God,

<i>The Oxford Group Movement: Is It Scriptural?</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; H. A. Ironside<br>
Loizeaux Brothers, Publishers, 19 West 21st Street, New York, 1943.<br>
LC: WB231 I71<br>
This is a very small volume, just 32 pages, a single sermon by
Rev. Ironside, denouncing the Oxford Groups and Buchmanism for being
unChristian. Rev. Ironside found that Buchmanism was not a Christian
religion, because the entire practice of Buchmanism
would still be possible even if Jesus Christ had never been born.<br>

<i>They Have Found A Faith</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Marcus Bach<br>
The Bobs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis, New York, 1946.<br>
Dewey: 289 B12<br>
This book describes eight different non-mainstream religions or cults, of which
The Oxford Group/Moral Re-Armament is one. The chapter on MRA is quite good,
quite revealing and descriptive, written by a first-hand witness who
knew his religions.

<i>Preview Of A New World; How Frank Buchman Helped his country Move from isolation
To world responsibility; USA 1939-1946</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arthur Strong<br>
Privately printed.<br>
Dewey: 267.16 P951<br>
ILL (InterLibrary Loan) number: 3 1120 01925 1791<br>
(Salt Lake City Public Library, 210 East 400 South, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84111)<br>
This is a fascinating piece of history. It is a large collection of photographs and
newspaper articles that come mostly from the period of time right
around World War II.
Arthur Strong was a British photographer who fell under the sway of Frank Buchman,
and who travelled with Buchman's flag-waving pseudo-patriotic road shows during
the period of 1939 to 1946. Arthur Strong assembled a travelogue of that period.<br>

(Arthur Strong also apparently fell under Buchman's commandment not to serve in the military,
because that British citizen stayed in the USA during the war years
from 1939 to 1946, while Britain
was begging all citizens to come home and help out. In fact, Arthur Strong was one
of the British subjects named in
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#draft_tamper3">the draft-tampering scandal</a>.)<br>

This book is hopelessly biased towards Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group/MRA
&#8212; it was assembed by a die-hard true believer decades after Buchman's
death, and he actually treated it
as if it were some kind of a holy scripture, to be enshrined in a specially-made
wooden box (see the photograph of the box in the beginning of the book)
&#8212; but it is still a wealth of photographs and other historical documents
for historians. There may not be any better collection of photographs of MRA in the world.

<i>Come Wind, Come Weather</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Daphne du Maurier<br>
Printed in Great Britain in August 1940.<br>
Printed in USA by Doubleday, Doran and Company, Inc., New York, 1941.<br>
LC: BV4915.D8<br>
A book of short stories of Buchmanites coping with the early part of
World War Two in Europe.
The authoress displayed the usual grandiose exaggeration of the benefits of
Buchman's teachings, along with minimization and denial of his total
failure to prevent the war. This is only thinly-veiled Buchmanite propaganda &#8212;
page 15 specifically endorsed Moral Re-Armament by name. We can also
very clearly see the philosophical roots of Alcoholics Anonymous here.
Du Maurier summarised several stories this way:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Megan saw she was a dictator in the home;<br>
George saw that drink and dishonesty were only attempts to escape from his own
defeat;<br>
... Anna that misfortune is no excuse for bitterness and self-pity.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">Page 74.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
In other words,
<ul>
<li> Megan needs to join Al-Anon and quit being
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Thumb">such a domineering bitch</a>.

<li> George needs to join A.A..

<li> Anna also needs to join Al-Anon and quit being so
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#too_good">self-pitying</a> and
<a href="orange-otherwomen.html#wife_unhappy">resentful</a>.

<i>Fresh Hope for the World: Moral Re-Armament in Action</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Edited and Introduced by Gabriel Marcel; Translated from the French
by Helen Hardinge<br>
Longmans, Green And Co. Ltd., London, 1960.<br>
LC: BJ10.M6M33 1960<br>
Another book of propaganda that glorifies Frank Buchman and MRA. The majority of
the book consists of autobiographical stories of being saved from adversity
by being converted to belief in Buchmanism. Then the section called
<i>&quot;The Universal Man &#8212; Frank Buchman&quot;</i> is a fawning piece of hero worship
and glorification of the cult leader, on the level of:<br>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
One of the veterans of American Communism said, 'I trained 300 men in
Communism, and most of them have left me. What is Frank Buchman's secret, that
the men he has trained remain faithful?'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(page 159.)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
That stubbornly ignores, of course,
the fact that Frank Buchman's cult also had
<a href="orange-rroot150.html#OG_dropouts">an immense drop-out rate</a>.
Buchman did not have any great &quot;secret&quot; training methods.
Once again, the cult members are in denial.<br>
</font>
(Besides, where was this secret Communist training camp in the USA that trained
300 revolutionaries?)<br>

<i>World Changing Through Life Changing: The Story of Frank Buchman and
Moral Re-Armament; A Thesis for the Degree of Master of Sacred Theology
at Andover Newton Theological School</i>  &nbsp; &nbsp; T. Willard Hunter<br>
Self-published, 1977.<br>
LC: BJ10.M6H8 1977<br>
This is a strange document. It is a large piece of work, 200 pages,
very well researched, and it is a source of obscure information that I've seen
nowhere else, but unfortunately the author was a true believer in Buchmanism,
and rarely criticized it.
The author was a contemporary of Frank Buchman and a devoted Buchmanite.
He was also a member of Moral Re-Armament for many years, and spent the war years of WWII touring
the country with Buchman's jingoistic shows.
He just rhapsodized about Buchman's &quot;great
accomplishments&quot; and dismissed or minimized his faults and failings.
He even wrote of his own judgement on the subject of Buchman:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The writer's claims to objectivity are slim. He knew and worked with Frank
Buchman and became one of his good friends. He gave his entire time &#8212; his
life, fortune, and sacred honor &#8212; to this work for eighteen years. A psychologist
would say of such a person that it would be difficult for him to avoid
seeking to justify himself.<br>

LC: CT788 M564P79 1977<br>
An excellent biography of Unity Mitford, the frivolous mad-cap aristocratic
blond English girl who enjoyed hanging out with Hitler and the Nazis, and she
was the sister of Diana Mitford, who first married Bryan Guiness, of the
<i>Guiness Stout</i> brewing family fortune,
and then dropped him for Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of
the British Union of Fascists.<br>
The above two books are nearly identical, other than the photographs,
where some were cropped or had text inset in the New York reprint.
The text of the two books is
identical, but laid out differently, printed in different fonts and sizes,
which results in very different page numbers for quotes.<br>

Unity Mitford and Lady Diana Mosley, in the <i>Ehreng&auml;ste</i> (Honored Guests)

This is a great read, the fascinating inside story of the rise of
an uncouth country bumpkin named Adolf Hitler to the leadership of
his nation... What makes it unusual is that it is an insider's story
that was written by someone who was relatively sane, and there
weren't very many of them in the inner circle of Nazis and
sycophants around Adolf. In the end, Putzi had to flee to the
USA to escape from the wrath of Hitler and the Gestapo, for
saying true and sensible things just too many times... (Or at
least, that's the way Putzi tells his story...)

Good, fascinating, and chilling.
Geli Raubal was both Hitler's half-neice and his only true girlfriend and lover,
She was found dead in Hitler's apartment in 1931, allegedly a suicide
at the early age of 23.
The descriptions of Hitler's sex life reveal an abused child who grew
into a really sick sado-masochistic narcissist.
The author presents a lot of evidence that supports
the distinct possibility that Geli was murdered by
the Nazis to keep her from disgracing Adolf Hitler and prematurely
ending his political career.

A very interesting biography of an amusing fraud, or a successful showman and entertainer,
depending on your viewpoint. He made quite a career of putting on faked psychic
acts, and got a fair bit of success and wealth. Unfortunately, that included
having some high-ranking Nazis owing him a lot of money,
and attracting Adolf Hitler as a believer.
Some of the Gestapo found killing Hanussen to be the easiest solution to
the problems that Hanussen created for them, so they did.

appears to be a reprint of an article first published in the

[Reprinted, Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1940.]<br>
Dewey: 289 F35<br>
Fascinating; this book covers a lot of groups and cults seldom
heard of today, like the
&quot;Dukhobors&quot; or &quot;Russellism&quot;.
The author tried to show all of the described groups in as positive
a light as he could. I guess he was just trying to avoid a religious
war, but sometimes it can be very disconcerting, like when he
<i>almost</i> sounds pro-KKK.
The chapter on the Ku Klux Klan as a dogmatic, cultish religion
that espouses high moral values
is thought-provoking, to say the least.
The chapter on Buchmanism is very interesting and informative.
Unfortunately, it only covers Buchmanism up to 1927.

<i>Fake It Til You Make It!</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Phil Kerns<br>
Victory Press, Carlton, Oregon 97111, 1982.<br>
ISBN: 0-9609908-0-1<br>
LC: HD9999.S742K4 1982<br>
An interesting expos&eacute; of Amway as a commercial cult.
The title of the book &#8212; &quot;<i>Fake It Til You Make It!</i>&quot; &#8212;
is an Amway slogan. It is also a common Alcoholics Anonymous slogan, which is not a coincidence.
Both cults exhort people to pretend that they are successful when they are not,
in order to give newcomers the 'right idea'.<br>
Kerns shows that the average Amway distributor actually <i>loses</i> a few
hundred dollars per year by working as a distributor. The average distributor
makes several hundred dollars per year on commissions from selling soap and
other Amway products, but he spends more than that on &quot;motivational&quot; books,
tapes, rally tickets and other such &quot;sales tools&quot;. (Which is easy to
do at $280 per ticket and $70 for a set of tapes.) (Page 117.)<br>
Kerns also criticizes the cultish behavior that he saw: blind obedience of leaders' orders,
demands for total commitment, suppression of dissent, devaluing the outsider,
hyper-emotionalism and brainwashing techniques used,
and grossly distorting Biblical teachings to make it sound like Amway is a Christian
organization.<br>
Kerns also does the math and shows how it is impossible for the majority of the rank
and file Amway distributors to get rich: Amway's total profits in 1982
were estimated to be $350 million.  But there were one million Amway
distributors that year. Even if Amway Corporation were to distribute
<i>ALL</i> of its profits to the distributors and keep nothing for itself
(unlikely), that would still only give the distributors $350 each.
Or Amway could manufacture 350 new millionaires and give nothing to
the other 999,650 distributors. (Pages 112-114.) But no way can everybody
get rich, no matter how hard they &quot;work the program&quot;.<br>
In addition, the largest amount any Amway distributor ever made in one year
was $416,000.
But at Amway rallies, top distributors are declared to have made fantastic amounts,
like $70 million a year. How could that be? Easy. By selling books, tapes, and rally tickets
to the rank and file distributors. (Page 85.)<br>
Easy, good reading.

about &quot;the commercialization of baseball&quot;. Some star

very large salaries ($125,000 for Babe Ruth's contract was mentioned),

wealthy multi-millionaire Ford felt that Babe Ruth

The level of stereotyping and hatred is almost unbelievable. For instance,
Ford considered all of the Jewish garment makers to be Bolsheviks:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
'Why the tendency of the Jew to the &quot;needle trades&quot;?
It is explained in his aversion to manual labor, his abhorrence of agricultural
life, and his desire to arrange his own affairs.'<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 91, <i>Jewish Hot-Beds of Bolshevism in the U.S.</i>)</font>
<br>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...the &quot;needle trades&quot; being exclusively Jewish, all their abuses
are Jewish too. ... Bolshevism is not Russian but Jewish...
<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 92, <i>Jewish Hot-Beds of Bolshevism in the U.S.</i>)</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
But in other chapters, Ford says that the Jews are controlling international
banking and finance, not the garment industry. And I never noticed Henry Ford
taking to the agricultural life either, out plowing the south forty behind his mule.
And Ford sure insisted on arranging his own affairs...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Why did a man of such wealth
and power spend so much time, money, and energy attacking people who had apparently
done nothing to him, and whose alleged world-wide conspiracies had not stopped Henry
Ford from becoming as wealthy as King Midas?
I have to seriously question Henry Ford Sr.'s sanity. (In his old age, <i>he was in
fact declared senile</i>, but his strange behavior began decades before that.)

Quite good. Thorough and well-documented. The story of one of the more
interesting characters in modern American history &#8212; the father of hate radio.
Father Charles Coughlin invented Rush Limbaugh's game back when radio
was a new medium.
And Caughlin was a stereotypical rabid right-winger, raving about &quot;The Jewish
Conspiracy&quot; and Communists, while parrotting Nazi propaganda.

<i>The Fine Art of Propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's Speeches</i>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Institute for Propaganda Analysis; editted by
Alfred McClung Lee and Elizabeth Briant Lee<br>
Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York, 1939.<br>
LC: HM263.I54<br>
A great little book that disects
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Coughlin9">the hate-mongering speeches of
Father Coughlin</a> and exposes the propaganda techniques that he used.
They reduce the list of the many possible logical fallacies and
propaganda tricks to just this short list that was in Father Coughlin's toolbox:
<ol>
<li> Name Calling &#8212; giving an idea or a person a bad name
<li> Glittering Generality &#8212; create over-generalized positive images and stereotypes
<li> Transfer (also known as Association) &#8212; gaining respectability or admiration
by association with something else that is widely admired or respected
<li> Testimonial &#8212; people tell stories that praise the propagandist's favorite cause
<li> Plain Folks &#8212; it's just us regular plain good-old-boys; nothing to get upset about
<li> Card Stacking &#8212; also called Monopolistic Card Stacking &#8212; it's stacking
the odds in your favor by carefully arranging the &quot;facts&quot; while
excluding undesired facts
<li> Band Wagon &#8212; the same thing as &quot;Everybody's doing it&quot;, or
&quot;Everybody knows&quot;, or &quot;Everybody believes&quot;...

<i>Brainwashing, From Pavlov to Powers</i>,

This book is very good. It will probably become another classic.
It really gives you the feeling of being there and going through
the brainwashing to which the American, British, and other United
Nations soldiers were subjected during the Korean War.
It also clearly explains just how the brainwashing worked and how
some men succumbed to it, and others successfully resisted it.
And the book is fascinating and a good read.

<i>Against Therapy; Emotional Tyranny and the Myth of Psychological
Healing</i> &nbsp; &nbsp; Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson<br>
Atheneum, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1988.<br>
ISBN: 0-689-11929-1<br>
LC: RC437.5.M38 1988<br>
Dewey: 616.89<br>
LCCN: 88-3509<br>
Excellent. Recommended. Exposes the sordid, unethical roots of psychotherapy.
Masson makes it clear that in his opinion, the scandals that he exposes are not
just flukes or exceptional cases, but rather that psychotherapy is inherently
corrupt.
After describing the horrendous physical, psychological and sexual abuse to
which a Dr. Rosen subjected his patients, Masson asked,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The point of this book is to raise precisely this question: Is Rosen an exception,
or is there something about psychotherapy, something in the very nature of
psychotherapy, that tends toward such abuses? Are these abuses or simply the
use that is made of psychotherapy? A prison warden, a slaveholder, and a
psychotherapist have in common the desire to control another person. (The
analogy may appear inexact, for the person in therapy, many believe, is free
to leave or quit. I don't believe this is true, though it would require a
discussion of the concept of &quot;informed consent.&quot; Nevertheless,
the parallels are striking. We know for a fact that many slaveholders thought
of themselves as kindly and argued that slaves were lucky to have them
as masters, for others would be worse. Medical doctors at Auschwitz argued
that if they didn't do what they did, others would do it more brutally.
People who participate in causing suffering to others often employ this
argument.)<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 147.)</font>
</blockquote>
Masson also included a chapter called &quot;Jung Amongst the Nazis&quot;,
which exposed the fascist and racist attitudes of Carl Jung. Bill Wilson made
a big mistake in claiming that Carl Jung was one of the spiritual
and psychological parents of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<i>Emotional Vampires: Dealing with People Who Drain You Dry</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;

Dewey: 158.2 B531e 2001<br>
This is a wonderful little easy-to-read book on the psychology of exploitative
personalities. It's easy to identify both Frank N. D. Buchman and William G. Wilson
as Narcissistic vampires &#8212; &quot;Legends in Their Own Minds&quot; who could not
tolerate the least little bit of criticism, and who felt entitled to take the
best of everything for themselves because they were so special, and who threw
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#rage1">screaming temper tantrums</a>
when the common rabble displeased them.<br>
