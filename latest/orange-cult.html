WHAT EXACTLY IS A CULT?
</center>
In general, a cult is a small religious group outside the established churches,
usually with a charismatic leader who is a strong authority figure.
One psychiatrist has described cults as &quot;religions that haven't grown up yet.&quot;<br>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
I have occasionally called A.A. a religious cult, and so have
other people. It might be helpful
if we ask, &quot;What are the real characteristics of a religious
cult? How do I tell if I have just walked
into a real religious cult, rather than just some church with a
bunch of overly-enthusiastic members?&quot;
<p>

Or, for that matter,<br>
<ul>
<li> &quot;Is this <i>non-religious</i> group acting like a cult?&quot;<br>
<li> &quot;Are we all yammering slogans out of
<i>The Little Red Book of Chairman Mao</i>?&quot;
<li>
Or, &quot;Is <b>Amway</b> a cult?&quot;
</ul>

<p>
Defining a cult will also help to counter the rationalization:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Everything is a cult. All religions are cults. So what?&quot;<br>
</font>
No, not all religions are cults, far from it.
<p>
So let's look at the characteristics of some typical cults.
<p>
Here are a few good general information pages to start with:
<ul>
<li> <a href="orange-cult-sos.html" target="_blank">S.O.S. Europe's description</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cultinfo.html" target="_blank">Berkeley Revive's description</a>
<li> <a href="orange-totalism.html" target="_blank"><i>Totalism in Today's Cults</i> by Jan Groenveld</a>
<li> <a href="orange-cultic_checklist.html" target="_blank">International Cultic Studies Association Cult Checklist</a>
</ul>

<p>
And then there is this list of cult characteristics,
which I have assembled from a wide variety of sources &#8212; books and
magazine articles on cults, other people's descriptions of cults,
and my own personal experiences with cults.
It incorporates the ideas of Lifton, Singer, Schein, Hassan, and
many others.
<p>
This cult description is structured as a test
that you can apply to any group that you might be wondering about &#8212;
religious or non-religious, crazy or not.
It is a collection of the common characteristics of many well-known
cults, and some not-so-well-known ones:<br>

<ul>
<li> Scientology &#8212; the vicious science fiction religion of
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard &#8212; &quot;Give me your life savings, your house, and
your credit cards, and I'll fix your mind. All non-Scientologists are
<i>Suppressive Persons</i> and hence, <i>Fair Game</i>. It's okay to
commit 'overts' against them and violate their 'dynamics'.&quot;

<li> The People's Temple &#8212; Rev. Jim Jones &#8212;
&quot;Drink Cyanide Kool-Aid if you love me.&quot;
<li> Synanon &#8212; Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Dederich &#8212;
The grand-daddy of all of the abusive &quot;confrontational attack
therapy&quot; drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs.
<li> The Moonies &#8212; Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church &#8212; &quot;I'm the
reincarnation of Jesus, so give me all of your money.&quot;
<li> The Hari Krishnas &#8212; ISKCON, the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada &#8212; &quot;The Earth is flat;
short-change your customers.&quot;
<li> EST &#8212; Werner Erhard's <i>Erhard Seminar Training</i> &quot;human potential
movement&quot; &#8212; &quot;You're all ass-holes and you can't go to the bathroom.&quot;
<li> The Family &#8212; Charles Manson &#8212; &quot;Helter Skelter, Kill An Actress For Me&quot;
<li> 3HO &#8212; Yogi Bhajan's &quot;Happy, Healthy, Holy&quot; Sikh Dharma
organization &#8212; &quot;Buy a .44 Magnum and a Mercedes Benz.&quot;
<li> Heaven's Gate &#8212; Marshall Herff Applewhite &#8212; &quot;Commit suicide and go to heaven in a
flying saucer&quot;
<li> The Branch Davidians &#8212; Vernon Howell, a.k.a. David Koresh, the Wacko From Waco &#8212; &quot;Give
me your wives and daughters to impregnate because I'm the Son of God.&quot;
<li> The Children of God &#8212; David Berg &#8212; &quot;Flirty Fishing Happy Hookers for
Jesus&quot;
<li> The Way International &#8212; more <i>Horizontal Recruiters for Jesus</i>
<li> The Rajneeshees &#8212; the followers of
<a href="orange-letters14.html#Bhagwan" target="_blank">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</a> &#8212; &quot;I'm God,
so buy me another Rolls Royce.&quot;
<li> The Divine Light Mission &#8212; &quot;the 14-year-old Perfect Master&quot;
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_guru_special" target="_blank">Maharaj Ji</a>
(who is now getting old) &#8212; &quot;I'm God, I really am. Ignore what my mother says about me.&quot;
<li> Siddha Yoga &#8212; Swami Muktananda &#8212; &quot;I can use my yogic powers
to screw all of the 14-year-old girls for an hour each.&quot;
<li> Transcendental Meditation &#8212; Maharishi Maheesh Yogi &#8212; &quot;Let me sell
you your own special word. Oh, and also some levitation lessons.&quot;
<li> Aum Shinrikyo &#8212; Shoko Asahara &#8212; &quot;The world is going to end, so have
some Sarin gas.&quot;
<li> The Solar Temple &#8212; Luc Jouret and Di Mambro &#8212; &quot;Commit Suicide
for the Summer Solstice Celebration.&quot;
<li> Jehovah's Witnesses &#8212; &quot;The world is going to end in 1975, and only 144,000
believers are going to get into Heaven.&quot;
<li> The Seed &#8212; Art Barker &#8212; &quot;Child abuse, torture, and Fascist
brainwashing is the best way to get children off of drugs.&quot;
<li> <a href="orange-gulags.html#Straight" target="_blank">Straight, Inc.</a> &#8212; Melvin
and Betty Sembler &#8212; &quot;How To Win (Republican) Friends And Influence
People (and become an Ambassador) by torturing some more children.&quot;
<li> The Oxford Groups &#8212;
<a href="orange-rroot060.html#FrankB" target="_blank"> Dr. Frank N. D. Buchman</a>
&#8212; &quot;Confess <i>all</i> of your sexual practices to me.
I want to hear every detail. Heil Hitler!&quot;
<li> The Mormons' Sons of Dan &#8212; &quot;Kill The Gentiles&quot;
<li> The Mormons' FLDS, the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints  &#8212;  Warren Jeffs &#8212; &quot;Marry (rape) another 14-year-old girl.&quot;
<li> Various historical American fundamentalist Christian cults
<li> Amway &#8212; &quot;You can get rich by getting other people to sell soap for you&quot;.
<li> And last, but not least, extremist political groups which
are cults built around the personality of a leader,
like Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party,
Mao Tse Tung's Chinese Communist regime,
and Joseph Stalin's murderous rule.
</ul>

<p>
I have structured this list of cult characteristics as a test
that you can apply to any group that you might be wondering about.
<p>
You rate the group in question on a scale of zero to ten
for each item, depending on how much the group shows that characteristic.
Zero means, &quot;They don't do that at all,&quot; while ten
means &quot;They really are like that.&quot;
<p>
Have fun.
