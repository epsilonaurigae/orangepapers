RE:  Religious Roots: The Last Hurrah: <i>Up With People</i></a>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I happened upon your site by pure chance.

<p>
While you have some interesting, some fun and some correct information
in here, you have some that is way out of context and simply wrong.
To insinuate or relate anything to &quot;Nazis&quot; is not only misinformation
and ridiculous, it's downright insulting.  I think four high-ranking
Democrats just did that to the GOP &#8212; what gives?  Perhaps your just
into tearing down our country as well?

<p>
And if I was guessing, it sounds like the &quot;creative&quot; writing of a
disgruntled former cast member or a member of the fanatical
organization who just completed their convention in North Carolina.
We had no brown-shirts, but I've seen 'em all over the country
supporting that idiot we have in office currently and the &quot;ship of
fools&quot; who support him.

<p>
I spent 4-5 years traveling with <i>Up With People</i> in the early seventies
and we raised not one flag, had no kumbaya gatherings around fires
with white hoods or any hoods for that matter.  We were mostly
regular, mostly good kids who had a knack for meeting people, learning
and performing.  We had a blast traveling, exchanging ideas and well,
just growing up with a great social experience, that's all.  As far as
protesting Vietnam or protesting the protestors, I for one never
thought the Vietnam war was a good exercise, but I never was against
the soldiers themselves or the principle behind the fighting (I hate
communism) or the folks who were more mature and were protesting the
war itself.  They made total sense when I got to their age.  Who wants
to die for politics anyway?  You can thank LBJ for that one!  (we had
no anti-protestor skits, only smiles for the ladies in the audience)

<p>
We had people of many colors, races, ethnicities, nationalities and
backgrounds.  Not everyone grew up, and not everyone got the same
academic education.  Ironically, while <i>Up With People</i> came out of MRA,
which was formed (I was told) out of concern for the atrocities of
WWII and yes, was very, very conservative, most alumni today (in my
opinion) are a bunch of liberal whacks.  The &quot;MRA&quot; thing was pretty
much dead by the time I joined up in the summer of 1970.  While I
disagree with a few liberal bents they have today (&quot;It Takes A
Village&quot; socialism &amp; forced community service (more socialism/
feelgoodism), I had a fabulous time and said so to Blanton Belk a few
years ago in a long-overdue thank you note.

<p>
I, myself am a Reagan conservative, have friends from many backgrounds
who agree with me, including blacks, Africans, Mexicans, Palestinians,
Jews, Israelis, Bosnians, Germans, English, and so on and so on.
Embracing the failed policies of socialism, Keynesian economics and
elitism politics is not my idea of progress.  Progressivism is to move
towards an October 17 revolution and the destruction of reason and
mankind itself.  Afghanistan is what?  A place the Bamer can test his
bombs and pretend to dislike muslims?  Geez Louise!

<p>
Well, I know not your politics except that you masterfully (?) have
taken a wonderful organization out of context and tried to paint it as
fanatical.  Who is a master of this?  The Democrat Party that's who.
Connect the dots?

<p>
I suggest you research further and put up the whole truth and correct
some of the falsehoods and out-of-context information you have
displayed.  How about it?

Hello Steve,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. Alas, you are long on belief and short on facts.

<p>
The evidence of
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">
 Frank Buchman's connnection to the Nazis</a> is overwhelming and undeniable, and documented.
You can't get much more connected to the Nazis than going to Nuremberg Nazi Party rallies, and to the 1936 Berlin Olympics,
as the personal guest of the Gestapo leader Heinrich Himmler, and then coming home to New York
and declaring to a newspaper, &quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;.
<p>
Sorry if you feel insulted by someone telling the truth. By the way,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#offended" target="_blank">the &quot;Oh I'm so offended&quot; drama queen ploy</a>
is a standard propaganda trick. When presented with undesired
facts, just go into the &quot;Oh I'm so offended and insulted&quot; dance, and try to avoid
an honest discussion of the facts.
<p>
One of the really bad things about Frank Buchman is that he was teaching the Nazi philosophy of
 &quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#obey_Buchman" target="_blank">just obey orders</a>&quot;.
Both Buchman and the Nazis taught that the average man is inferior and mentally incompetent, and
cannot think for himself, so the best thing that he can do is just obey the orders of a superior
who knows more than him. With the Nazis, that became &quot;obey your superior officer&quot;, with the chain of
command going all of the way up to Adolf Hitler. With Buchman, his teaching was
ostensibly that you should
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">&quot;obey the Guidance of God&quot;</a>.
But then he declared that you were
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">not spiritually qualified
to hear the voice of God</a>, so you should just obey your
sponsor and other cult elders who will tell you what God <i>really</i> said.
So that chain of command went up to Frank Buchman.

<p>
Such slavery is of course the antithesis of American democracy and freedom.
And blind obedience to any leader is one of the surest roads to hell.

<!--
<P>
And then, of course, there were lots of other negatives to Frank Buchman and his teachings, which is
totally typical of cults, like:

<P><ul>
<LI> The end justifies the means. It's okay to lie to get more converts.
<LI> The group's dogma and teachings are infallible. You can't criticize it.
<LI> Any disagreement with the leader is evidence that you are evil.
<LI> You must devote your life to the cult.
<LI> Members of the group are more moral than ordinary people.
And more intelligent too.
<LI> 
</ul>

Well that is certainly from outer space. I criticize an old pro-Nazi cult religion from the nineteen-thirties,

Since when is America equal to an old pro-Nazi cult religion?
<p>
Apparently, to you, &quot;&quot;tearing down America&quot; means that someone says something that you don't want to hear.
<p>
I watched a bunch of the Democratic Convention, and I don't recall anybody accusing Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan
of being a Nazi. Can you tell me precisely who said what, and when and where, and give quotes?
Thank you.

It's funny that you consider critics of &quot;<i>Up With People</i>&quot; to be &quot;disgruntled former cast members&quot;.

<p>
Well you missed out on the NBC TV national television broadcast in 1968 where the clean-cut war-mongering UWP

off of the stage. Find a copy of that and watch it.

<p>
Right. That was the standard MRA party line. Now it is to Frank Buchman's credit that he was not a racist.
Unfortunately, what that really meant was that he wanted everybody to be his obedient unthinking slave,
regardless of their race, religion, sex, creed, or country of national origin.
Frank didn't discriminate. He wanted everybody to be a &quot;slave of God&quot;.

Yes, I'm sure that you enjoyed the travel. (I grew up in the Air Force, so also I

By the time you were in UWP, the war was mostly over  &#8212;  and extremely
unpopular and controversial by then  &#8212; so obviously they took the
war-mongering skits out of the show. By then, going to college campuses and putting
on a jingoistic flag-waving pro-war show was the height of uncool.

<p>
I'm glad to hear that you didn't approve of the Vietnam War.
<p>
Actually, the situation is far more complex than just a mistake that LBJ made. Oh, he's guilty all right,
but there is a lot more to it. President Eisenhower wrote
in his memoirs that it was obvious in the nineteen-fifties that Ho Chi Minh was so popular that he would
win any fair election in Vietnam by a landslide, so the promised elections to determine the future of South Vietnam
were simply not held. Eisenhower betrayed his proclaimed belief in democracy when an election wouldn't turn out
the way that he wanted. The Vietnamese people rebelled, and that is what started the Vietnam War.
Then Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon all escalated and continued it.

<p>
They gave you a false history of MRA. Actually, Frank Buchman started using the Moral Re-Armament name
in 1938, after the Catholic Church banned his &quot;Oxford Group&quot; organization.
That's a cute trick: if the Catholic Church bans your Oxford Group cult religion, change
the name to &quot;Moral Re-Armament&quot;, and claim
that it's a different organization, so there is no ban.  The name change had nothing to
do with concern for the people who died in World War II, because those victims had not been killed by Frank's Nazi
friends like Heinrich Himmler, yet.
Look here:
<a href="orange-rroot270.html" target="_blank">The Oxford Group Morphs Into MRA</a>.

<p>
The fact that they fed you a false history of MRA is just more evidence that MRA really is a cult.
They think nothing of falsifying their history and lying to newcomers and inventing a totally fictitious
history where MRA is very virtuous and did great things, rather than an organization that praised Adolf Hitler
and Heinrich Himmler.
Honestly, I ask you, what kind of a church lies that much?

<p>
MRA was not dead in 1970, it was hidden. You were part of its publicity wing. And MRA still exists today.
They still own
<a href="orange-rroot660.html" target="_blank">that palace in Caux, Switzerland</a>, and
<a href="orange-rroot540.html#Mackinac_Island" target="_blank">the center at Mackinac Island</a>, USA.
And they are still talking about reviving the <i>Up With People</i> show.

It's nice that you have friends of all races. What you are really telling me is that you

You are still reciting the UWP/MRA party line.

Your opinions on economics ignore the fact that 30 years of Reagan's
&quot;trickle-down&quot; economics have destroyed our economy.
George W. Bush did a great job of finishing off the economy. I don't know if the economy will ever recover.
The answer is certainly not to do more of what killed the economy.

Progressivism is not Communism. Geez Louise! Get real.

<p>
Actually, it was Frank Buchman who threatened &quot;the destruction of reason&quot;. He was one of those evangelists
who insisted that the rational mind was a mistake and an illusion, and that people should just &quot;have faith&quot;
(in his teachings, of course).
The Oxford Group cult specifically demanded that people give up their rational minds.
Ebby Thacher and Shep Cornell recruited Bill Wilson like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Ebby and Shep C. were now asking him to give up the one attribute
of which he was the most proud, the one quality that set a man above
the animals &#8212; his inquiring, rational mind. And they wanted him to
give this up for an illusion.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
... what they were asking him to do represented weakness to him.
How could a man so demean himself as to surrender the one thing
in which he should have faith, his innate, inquiring mind? &nbsp;
...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It might be the last arrogant gasp of alcoholic pride but,
miserable and terrified as he was, he would not humble himself
here. On this point he would go out swinging.<br>

<p>
Nevertheless, within a month, under the influence of <i>delirium tremens</i>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#belladonna" target="_blank">hallucinogenic drugs</a>, and
cult recruiting mind games,
Bill Wilson flipped out and got converted into a true believer who insisted that

to give up reason</a>:

<p>
It's sort of like getting infected with the Rabies virus, isn't it?
Or getting bitten by a vampire. Frank Buchman's
Oxford Group cult bit Bill Wilson and infected him, and now he has to run around trying to
bite and infect others.

<p>

<p>
That is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#claim_out_of_context" target="_blank">the standard propaganda trick

I have not taken <i>Up With People</i> &quot;out of context&quot; &#8212; the truth is just the opposite: I put it in
its correct Frank Buchman &#8212; Moral Re-Armament context.
<i>Up With People</i> had a parent organization that you are trying very hard to ignore, and
pretend didn't exist.

<p>
Are you actually so paranoid that you think that the Democratic Party is behind someone exposing the true
history of Alcoholics Anonymous? You imagine that the Democrats are writing about the Oxford Group and
Moral Re-Armament?
Why would they even care about a cult religion that has not been very popular since the nineteen-thirties?
<p>
In the interests of full disclosure, I am not connected to the Democratic Party in any ways except:
<ol>
<li> I am a registered Democrat voter.
<li> I volunteered for the Obama campaign for a few days back in 2008, until Senator Obama broke his promise to
prosecute the telephone company executives who had bugged the telephones of everybody in America.

That's it. The truth is, the Democrats are looking at the next election, not the history of Alcoholics Anonymous
or the Oxford Group or Moral Re-Armament or <i>Up With People</i>.

Oh, I have researched further. I have done many years of research. (And I'm still doing a little more, now and then.)

<p>
Now you should do some research.

You can start by reading the entire history of Frank Buchman, the Oxford

<a href="orange-religiousroots.html" target="_blank">The Religious Roots of A.A. and the Twelve Steps</a>.

I remember a movie about Berlin in the nineteen-thirties called <i>The Jazz Kids</i>. The young people
who joined the Hitlerjugend also had a real good time and participated in fun activities, and
even got toys like motorcycles to ride. But that didn't make Adolf Hitler an okay guy.
And it didn't make the Hitlerjugend an okay organization.<br>
Speaking of which, didn't you notice the similarity between the <i>Up With People</i> show and the show
that the Chinese Communists put on at the Peking Olympics four years ago? They also had a big
fluffy mindless song-and-dance show that said, &quot;Up With Chinese Communist People&quot;. 

<li> You have shown that you actually still believe in the rabid right-wing philosophy of Frank Buchman and gang.
That isn't good. Forty years and you haven't learned anything new? They really miseducated you.

<li> You have said that you never participated in praising the War in Vietnam. Good. But that doesn't change the
previous history when UWP did. I'm sure that you also never participated in praising Adolf Hitler. But
that doesn't change the fact that Frank Buchman did.
<li> You have totally ignored the reason why the <i>Up With People</i> show existed: To promote Frank Buchman's
evil philosophy with a pretty song and dance show.
</ul>
<p>
So, do you have any historical information to offer?

</ol>
<p>
Have a good day.

I'm not going that route now though after everything I've read so far. It is

<p>
Hi everyone,

<p>
This is Ilse (ilse/friendthegirl/ftg from Stinkin' Thinkin'
&lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160405102729/http://stinkin-thinkin.com/" target="_blank">http://stinkin-thinkin.com</a>&gt;)
writing to you. I'm doing a little outreach for Stanton Peele's new venture
 &#8212;  an online addiction treatment program &#8212; and was hoping that you could
add our links to your blogroll or resource lists for AA alternatives. If
it's not too much to ask, perhaps you could even do a post about it or
place a small ad square in your sidebar ( for which I can promise you a
monthly pittance &#8212; $20, which I hope might be just enough to cover your
hosting fee plus a cup of coffee!).

<p>
Stanton created The Life Process Program several years ago, which is a
non-AA addiction treatment program that had been used exclusively in
residential treatment, with great success. He's recently taken back
exclusive control of the program and has made it available online, for a
fraction of the cost of formal treatment.

<p>
At the moment, the Life Process Gambling Program
&lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160405102729/http://www.lifeprocessgamblingprogram.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lifeprocessgamblingprogram.com/</a>&gt;
has launched.
<p>
Shortly, he's going to open the doors to the Life Process Drug and Alcohol Program
&lt;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160405102729/http://www.lifeprocessprogram.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lifeprocessprogram.com/</a>&gt;.
<p>
And, the LPP will expand into all areas of addiction.

<p>
Since I know that you all are keenly interested in alternative philosophies
about addiction and alternative approaches to addiction treatment, and are
familiar with Stanton &#8212; many of you know him personally &#8212; and his ideas, I
won't go into too much detail about what he has to offer. But I have
attached a brief overview of the gambling site, which you are welcome to
post online, if you're so inclined.

<p>
Please feel free to contact me &lt;ilse@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com&gt; with any
questions you have about the online LPP. I would be so happy to hear from
you.

<p>
I hope this email finds you all well!

<p>
Ilse

<p>
PS &#8212; I'm not going to make a habit of spamming you all. If I don't hear
from you, I'll assume you're not interested and won't contact you about
this again.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Ilse,
<p>
It's nice to hear from you. You know, I don't do link exchanges, ever, and I don't accept
paid advertising, ever. And I don't think I should change those rules now.
 But I'll give a plug to Stanton for free. He's one of my favorites
because he's been telling the truth about addictions and recovery for a lot of years now.
So I'll at least give a little free publicity to whatever he's into next.
<p>
So here's your plug. Have a good day now.

<font color="blue">
Hi again, Ilse,

<p>
Well, it isn't really such an exception. It's just that I can't be
accepting advertising because it implies that I'm endorsing something
by allowing it to be on my web site, and the vast majority of the
offers for ads that I get are for 12-Step-oriented rehabs.

<p>
And even when they say that they aren't 12-Step, I get letters that say
that they really are, after you get past the buzz-words and the publicity
fluff.

<p>
So I just don't accept any advertising because I can't possibly check
them all out and figure out which are the good ones.

<p>
But Stanton is easy. I've been quoting him for years.

<p>
Have a good day now.<br>

Hi. Still thank you so much for the exception.

<p>
I realized pretty quickly that these 12 Step treatment outfits were
obscuring their real affiliation by claiming to be based in CBT, which they
justified by somehow construing AA as essentially CBT (can't tell you how
many times I heard that!). Of course, anything AA promotes as having some
basis in CBT has nothing to do with AA proper. I mean, how does claiming
free will over the direction of your life jibe with turning your life and
will over to Whatever? When you land on their websites, they're all about
CBT, but if you dig just a little (not much) deeper, you see that all they
have to offer is 12 step. It's like how Creationism morphed into
Intelligent Design.

<p>
The fact that they're consciously conflating the two seems to indicate that
the're choosing to obscure, which is interesting.

<p>

My very best,

<p>
Ilse

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Ilse,
<p>
Yes, it really is disgusting, how they try to pass off 12-Step programs as CBT.
That's another classic example of a con artist trying to sell his quackery as &quot;scientific treatment&quot;.

<p>
The fact that they do that seems to reveal that they know that 12-Step therapy is discredited and unscientific,
and they are trying to wrap their quackery in a cloak of scientific respectability by claiming that it is
&quot;just like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&quot;, and &quot;just as good as CBT&quot;, and &quot;based on CBT&quot;.
<p>
And I guess it also means that they just don't have anything to sell to the customers, other than an old cult
religion...
<p>
By the way, your point about free will is a good one. If we are &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot; like
A.A. teaches, and Step One says, then how can
we consciously, rationally, choose to live a healthier lifestyle, like how CBT teaches?
Duh....  <i>Danger Will Robinson, Does not compute!</i>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day now, and good luck to Stanton's new venture.

Hi Terrance,
<p>
A few thoughts and observations

<p>
1. I just read this nugget from the General Manager of AA's General Service
Office, Phyllis Halliday:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;One thing is certain, there would be no hope for any alcoholic anywhere
if the collective pulse of this lifesaving spiritual fellowship were not
lighting the way with love and trust.&quot;
<p>
==  Phyllis Halliday, General Manager of A.A's USA/Canada General Service
Office, addressing A.A.'s 16th European Service Meeting in Frankfurt,
Germany, October 23, 2011. (file attached)
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Her statement that there is NO HOPE FOR ANY ALCOHOLIC, ANYWHERE, WITHOUT AA
is another clear example of AA's opinion that AA is the one and only
solution for alcoholics.

<p>
2. Also contained in the ESM report were AA country reports from many
European countries which showed:

<p>
Theft of &euro;35,000 (~$44,000) from AA Italy by AA's &quot;trusted servants&quot;, and

<p>
Theft of 15% of the annual budget of AA Portugal by the Chairwoman of
Portugal's GSB.

<p>
Trusted servants indeed!

<p>
3. What I've also noticed is that Phyllis Halliday; alcoholic, AA member
and General Manager of AA's GSO, is one of the most publicly well known
&quot;anonymous&quot; members of AA in the country. Why is there one rule regarding
anonymity at the public level for ordinary AA members and another for
Phyllis Halliday? How will AA deal with this anonymity breaker?

<p>
The AA Service Manual outlines how to deal with an individual who breaks
the Traditions, including traditions 11 and 12 regarding anonymity:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;Anonymity breaks: Upon learning that an A.A. member's anonymity has been
broken in the media, G.S.O. communicates with the area delegate,
who can either remind the member of the anonymity Tradition or ask G.S.O.
to send a reminder.&quot;
<p>
== Bill Wilson, The A.A. Service Manual, page S73, AAWS Inc., 2005.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;...we cannot and should not enter into public controversy, even in
self-defense.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Privately, however, we can inform Tradition-violators that they are out of
order. When they persist, we can follow up by using such other resources of
persuasion as we may have, and these are often considerable. Manifested in
this fashion, a persistent firmness will often bring the desired result.&quot;
<p>
== Bill Wilson, The A.A. Service Manual, pages 70 &amp; 71, AAWS Inc., 2005.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
So, a personal reminder from the area delegate or from GSO itself should
bring the errant member back into line. If that doesn't work then AA can
resort to *&quot;resources of persuasion&quot;* applied with *&quot;persistent firmness&quot;*.

<p>
Of course, a very different message is presented to the public, the clergy,
corrections professionals and professionals in the treatment industry,
regarding AA's treatment of its own members. In several publications AA
insists that it does not follow up with or try to control its members:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

&quot;What A.A. Does NOT Do<br>
A.A. does not: ...follow up or try to control its members...&quot;
<p>
== A Message to Corrections Professionals (page 2), AAWS Inc., 1988<br>
== Members of the Clergy ask about Alcoholics Anonymous (page 18), AAWS Inc., 1992<br>
== If You are a Professional...(page 4), AAWS Inc., 1986
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
So, what is the truth? AA insists that it does not follow up or try to
control its members yet the AA Service Manual encourages following up and
trying to control AA members. The truth is that AA does what is beneficial
to AA depending on the situation.
<p>
The fundamentalist's manifesto and its literature always contains both
sides of every argument (sometimes presented on the same page). In this way
the fundamentalist can support or oppose any opinion or behavior at any
time while having a seemingly legitimate foundation for its (short term)
belief since it is substantiated by what is written in the
manifesto/literature. Some of the hundreds of examples in AA are:

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Upon therapy for the alcoholic himself, we surely have no monopoly.&quot;<br>
== Big Book, Fwd to the 2nd Ed. &#8212;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
[We don't have the only solution.]

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;For most cases, there is virtually no other solution.&quot;<br>
==  Big Book, page 43 &#8212;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
[There is no other solution.]

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...every A.A. group can manage its affairs exactly as it pleases...&quot;<br>
12&amp;12, page 146 &#8212;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
[Do what you want.]
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;...the group, exactly like the individual, must eventually conform...&quot;<br>
12&amp;12, page 146 &#8212;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
[Do what you're told.]

<p>
So, what will AA do regarding Phyllis Halliday breaking her anonymity? AA
will do what benefits AA &#8212; ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
<p>
And what will AA do regarding protecting AA members from harassment, abuse,
assault and rape by other AA members? AA will do what benefits AA &#8212; 
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

Hey Orange,

<p>
First off I just want to commend you on such a great, well basically book, that
you have written. I am also a non-believer although i maintain a prescense at AA
and NA meetings trying to get people to see the truth.  As you know most of them
do not take too kindly to someone questioning their crazy self-righteous
bullshit.  I have been ostracized over and over, and am even on &quot;Old timer&quot;
imposed bans from some meetings.  But if it means that I convert at least one
person from that cult to a better life it is all worth it.  It is very nice to
know there is a wealth of information available for people to see the truth
about AA, I just wish it could go mainstream and expose it for the cult it is.
Anyway,  keep up the fight good sir.

<p>
Much Respect,<br>
JB

Hello JB,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for all you do. You sound like a good member of the
<a href="orange-letters280.html#NRL" target="_blank">Newcomer Rescue League</a>.
Congratulations.
<p>
I think that we actually are &quot;going mainstream&quot; right now, and exposing A.A. as a cult.
Every day, there is more information available about the cultish nature of A.A., and about
how it doesn't really work. More articles are showing up on the Internet all of the time.
Heck, a couple of years ago, even
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links" target="_blank">NBC television and Newsweek magazine
and the Washington Post newspaper were reporting</a> how A.A.
had degenerated into a sexual exploitation society. So the cat's out of the bag; it isn't
a secret any more.
<p>
The A.A. propagandists are fighting back and trying hard to perpetuate the myth of 
&quot;A.A. the Salvation of Alcoholics&quot;, but they are losing the war.

<p>
Have a good day now.
<p>

Hi Orange,

<p>
I read your response berating me, and something that worked for me. It was
a nice gesture, I suppose.

<p>
You said you are trying to fight AA, or the aa mentality~some kind of
bullshit comment from the peanut gallery. As I was scanning your response
(I graduated from seventh grade a long time ago, and I know drama when I
see it) , it gave me a little giggle. I saw penn and tellers episode on AA
(which was funny, because our traditions state we be anonymous~ at the
level of tv and media)~ and I laughed the entire way through it. It was
great entertainment. There is a reason we are anonymous.

<p>
I am wondering why you are trying to fight aa, or well, whatever it is you
are fighting. You said you intend to expose our lies, or something close to
this.  Feel free. But, May I ask you a question? Are you happy in life? Are
you happy in your own skin? Are you ok with who you are?

<p>
People who are comfortable with themselves don't need to fight anything,
anywhere. I don't say that from an AA point of view. That is logic. If you
were ok with yourself, you wouldn't have to do any of this. Maybe some
drunk killed your cat. Maybe some drunk molested you, or maybe aa attempted
to help you, and and you got hurt. Maybe a husband or wife left you because
of some kind of addiction. Maybe you have a tiny wee wee, Or daddy beat you
up. Personally, I don't care what it is. But no person who feels happy with
themselves posts a bunch of stuff under an assumed name, and claims to be
fighting the good fight.

<a name="millions"> </a>

<p>
I also noticed that, in anything I say, you felt obligated to add links to
your response. That seems like a lot of work to me, knowing full well I
won't read them. I actually have a life, and other priorities than to
listen to some blathering idiot go on about nothing.I have worked all
twelve steps, and as a result, my  life improved. Also, AA did help
millions get sober. People get thirsty all the time. They go, they come
back, they try to get sober again. I would say only those who died are the
ones we failed with.... and I don't really give a shit about whatever
stupid fucking response you have researched for me. I see them every day.

<p>
<a name="resentment"> </a>
So, go on with your fantasies and
<a href="orange-letters128.html#resentment99" target="_blank">your resentment</a>.
I'm attending another
meeting in a few hours, going back to work, and then going home and going
to bed. Tomorrow, I am accepting a position that will give me forty
thousand more, fully bennys, opps to travel the world, and my own company
car... Ill be able to go to the gym whenever I want, make my own hours, and
speak with pro athletes. That's not bad for someone who was homeless drunk
working her way to rebuild her life in a shithole country with a shithole
economy. But, hey, AA doesn't work.

<p>
The bad thing still happened to you, whatever that is... and however you
cope with that is fine with me. If you feel that &quot;fighting it&quot; or fighting
AA keeps away your personal demons, Keep on fighting. I hope you win that
battle with yourself.

<p>

<font color="blue">
Hello again, Amy,
<p>
Now I'll repond to your statements.

I did not berate you. I am very careful about not doing that. I attack bad ideas, I attack misinformation
and lies, and I attack the Alcoholics Anonymous cult, but I do not attack the people who are
unfortunate enough to believe in a pack of lies.
<p>
This is an attack on a person: &quot;You are a stupid bitch.&quot;
<p>
This is an attack on a lie: &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous does not have a success rate; they just lie about
their recovery rate and try to count every sober person around as one of their success stories.&quot;
<p>
Do you see the difference?

Yes, Penn &amp; Teller are very entertaining, aren't they?
The fact remains that A.A. still has no respect for alcoholics. You avoided mentioning that point.

<p>
Funny that you should mention anonymity. A previous letter was just revealing how
the current General Manager of the GSO is not anonymous.
<a href="orange-letters325.html#iamnotastatistic" target="_blank">Look here</a>.
These days, some A.A. members choose to be anonymous, but most of the celebrities and big-wigs do not.
They even brag about their A.A. membership, like how Gary Busey did in that Penn &amp; Teller show.

Yes, I'm happy, and having a good time.  You wonder why I'm fighting a lying organization

If you have better things to do with your life, why are you still involved with an old cult religion?
<p>
And once again, there are no &quot;millions saved by A.A.&quot;.
That is just another standard A.A. lie. No truth to it.
A.A. does not even have 2 million members in the entire world, 
and much of the A.A. membership is not sober,
so they cannot possibly have saved millions.
<p>
The truth is that most of the A.A. membership is just churn   &#8212;   another 100,000 people are
forced into A.A. meetings for a little while, and then another 100,000 drop out.
And then another 100,000 go in, and then another 100,000 drop out.
There are only a few hundred thousand committed A.A. cult members in the whole world.
