Subject:  	Im leading an aa meeting this morning<br>

<p>
So i was looking for a topic for the meeting this morning and ran across
your article on why aa doesn't work.

<p>
I ask people all the time if they have seen those fad diets on television,
you know the ones, the south beach, p90x, body for life, the juicing
thing.  Usually they say yes.  Then I tell them that not a single one of
them are fad diets.  They ALL work.  I mean the proof is right there,
beautifully sculpted bodies, fat people that are now thin.  You really
can't object.  However, if you rad the fine print you get the rub; results
not typical.

<p>
Well, the simple reason why the results aren't typical is that most people
don't follow the program or those who do, stop after a fashion and return
to their old self.

<p>
AA is no different.  There is no magic other than doing the next right
thing makes life flow so much better.  prayer and meditation are simply a
means to get into that flow.

<p>
If a person stops working their AA program or has never really worked it,
they drink again.  it really is that simple.

<p>
God or the universe removing my obsession with smoking is in fact a
bonifide miracle in my book.  More so than removing my obsession witth
alcohol. Just FYI.

Hello Kevin,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
When you claim that only people who &quot;work the program&quot; to your satisfaction really count,
you are using the logical fallacy and propaganda trick that is called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">Observational Selection</a>,
also known as &quot;Cherry Picking&quot;.

<p>
By the same illogic, someone could claim that Satan-worship has a 100% success rate as a program of sobriety:
<font color="#9F0000">
&quot;Just worship Satan, and always do our Satanic practices instead of drink alcohol,
and you won't have a problem with drinking. NEVER have we seen a person fail,
who has THOROUGHLY followed our path.&quot;
</font>

<p>
But of course that doesn't mean that the Satanic program is any good for the average people who don't want to join
a cult religion.

<p>
This line 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume" target="_blank">assumes facts not in evidence</a>:

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Baloney. There is no truth to that. I stopped going to A.A. meetings 12 years ago, and I still have almost 12 1/2 years
of sobriety now.
<p>
And in fact, the vast majority of the sober people do not go to A.A. meetings, and never did:

<p>
The only thing you diod in this reply is put words in my mouth.  I didn't
say, &quot;people who &quot;work the program&quot; to your satisfaction really count&quot;n
never would.  I couldn't give a rip how anyone else works their program.
The FACT is that those who work a program daily, HONESTLY, stay sober.
Those who don't don't.  When I stop doing it DAILY, I will most certainly
drink because I'm an alcoholic.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Kevin,
<p>
No, I did not put words into your mouth. You said,


<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...most people don't follow the program or those who do, stop after a fashion and return to their old self.
<p>
AA is no different. There is no magic other than doing the next right thing makes
life flow so much better. prayer and meditation are simply a means to get into that flow.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
So who decided whether people had &quot;followed the program&quot;?  Who decided
whether they &quot;did the right thing&quot;? Well, you did.  It wasn't Genghis Khan,
or Napoleon, or the Pope, or Jesus. It was you. You decided that the people who
drank didn't work the program right, and those people who abstained from drinking
did work the program right.
<p>
Then, by that false logic, you could declare that 100% of the people who were sober worked the Program right.

<p>
And again, you are judging people now, even while you deny doing it:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The FACT is that those who work a program daily, HONESTLY, stay sober.
Those who don't don't.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And how do you decide whether those people are working the program HONESTLY? You pass judgement on them, even
while you say that you don't <font color="black"> &quot;give a rip how anyone else works their program.&quot;</font>
<p>
You decide that those who are drinking are not working the program HONESTLY, while those who don't drink
are working the program HONESTLY.

</font>
<p>
God is doing me no special favors as again you like to attribute.  I prayed
and meditated and followed a PROGRAM of smoking cessation and because I
FOLLOWED a program and continue to FOLLOW a program I remain smoke free.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You declared that it was a miracle that you quit smoking.
<font color="black">&quot;God or the universe removing my obsession with smoking
is in fact a bonifide miracle in my book.&quot;</font>
A miracle is an event where God or Jesus or
somebody with supernatural powers breaks the laws of physics and makes something impossible happen.
So who or what performed your miracle for you?
Was it God or Jesus or Gandalf? And how did you talk that being into doing you a big favor and
making you quit smoking?
</font>
<p>
There is no magic to AA nor is God MAGIC fairly land.  There IS a right way
to live and a wrong way and the effects of living the right way can be felt
almost immediately.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Now that statement sounds reasonable. That rules out A.A. of course.
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">The practices of Dr. Frank Buchman's evil cult religion</a>
are not the right way to live.
</font>
<p>
If you're an alcoholic then I can almost guarantee that you are drinking or
will shortly.  I KNOW this because I am an alcoholic and I know how it goes.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Wrong again. Yes, I'm an alcoholic, and I have well over 12 years of sobriety now. I also don't take drugs
or even smoke cigarettes. I have 12 years off of them too. And no, I'm not going to relapse soon.
And no, I don't need A.A. or the 12 Steps to keep me sober.
<p>
What you are demonstrating now is the standard cult characteristic,
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_cant_without" target="_blank">84. You can't make it without the group.</a>

<p>
And the A.A. answer to that Cult Test question is here:
<a href="orange-cult_a8.html#ca_cant_without" target="_blank">84. You can't make it without the group.</a>

</font>
<p>
I use AA to keep me sober.  I am not beholden to AA and AA asks me for
nothing, so how does that make them a cult?

<p>
Kevin

<p>
<font color="blue">
You use A.A. to keep you sober? But you just said that A.A. does not have any magic. Only right living counts.
You can just as easily do the right living without belonging to a cult religion. 
<p>
I also use right living to keep me sober, and that's why I don't join crazy cult
religions, or do their mind-bending practices, or lie to newcomers to recruit
them into the cult, or tell sick people that A.A. has a never-fails cure for what ails them.
<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Terry,

<p>
I hope that you and all your friends, feathered and otherwise, are doing well.

<p>
As I irregularly dip into the pool of knowledge provided by various Buddhists I keep
encountering the word &quot;compassion&quot;. With a nagging thought, the likes of which can
only be prompted by omission, I dd a word search of the pdf file of the Big Book
provided by AA.org. Yeah, just as I thought, &quot;compassion&quot; is to be found nowhere in
the Big Book or the Twelve&amp;Twelve.

<p>
The saddest thing is that I wasn't surprised at all...

<p>
Yours,

<font color="blue">
Hello Mat,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the good wishes.
And thank you very much for a really revealing observation. Somehow, the idea of searching for
compassion in the <i>Big Book</i> never occurred to me.
<p>
And you are quite right. Not one reference to compassion? There are all kinds of lectures about how
you must join A.A. or die, and lots of raps about how disgusting those alcoholics are, but no
compassion at all.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day now.

<p>
It's been a couple of years since I've written you and I'm coming up on
five years sober. The last three being entirely without AA. After a couple
of years of meetings and having never done one single ridiculous step, the
light bulb went on and I realized AA had nothing to do with my sobriety. It
is indeed a cult whose motto should be, <b><i>&quot;Misery loves company. Keep coming
back!&quot;</i></b>

<p>
When I encounter the few friends I made at meetings that are brainwashed
enough to keep going back, they always ask &#8212; with raised eyebrow, &quot;How are *you
*doing?&quot; And while I'd like to say &quot;better than you&quot; I take the higher road
and just say &quot;fine, thanks.&quot; I know deep down they truly believe I will
fail and die because I'm not working a good program.
<p>
Which brings me to the reason I'm writing. I just read a letter you
received from &quot;Kevin&quot; who wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

they drink again,. It really is that simple.&quot;<br>

&quot;Kevin&quot;, I'm here to tell you...You. Are. Wrong. I never really worked it,
stopped going entirely and I have never been happier or felt stronger about
remaining sober ON MY OWN. In fact, I work a wonderful one step
program...Step One &#8212; Don't drink!...It really is that simple. You fool.

<p>
I enjoy your work Orange. Have a great day.

Hello Tom,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I have to agree. The funny thing for me is, when I meet the people
whom I used to know from A.A. and N.A. meetings, or from the &quot;treatment program&quot;, I hear that
most all of them have relapsed, so they aren't too eager to lecture me about how to stay sober.
When I met her on the streets years later, my former floor
manager in rehab housing told me that out of my entire treatment center class
of well over 100 people, I was the only one who had not relapsed.
<p>
I only know a few people from those days who are even still going to meetings. Most have decided
that it's a waste of time. I recall one old guy sitting in the lobby explaining why he doesn't
go to meetings any more:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I've heard all of their stories so many times that I can recite
all of them. I just don't need to sit through any more of that.&quot;
</font>

<p>
Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Timothy&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Love the site<br>

<p>
Mr. Orange,

<p>
Stumbled on your site a couple of weeks ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it.<br>
I must say that the amount of work involved in collecting and collating
such a vast amount of information is just beyond me.<br>
I haven't read it all but I've made my way through a lot of it and will
continue reading in the future.

<p>
I thought it was just me!<br>
I thought I was the only one. The only one who saw that the Emperor had no
clothes :-)

<p>
I was forced by court order to check myself into a rehab facility and then
AA meetings for a year as part of a probation plea for my second DUI.<br>
Did I have a drinking problem? Of course I did. Nobody without a drinking
problem gets up two hours early to go to work and drinks 3/4 of a pint of
Bourbon, snort some lines (At 6 A.M.) has three or four whiskey's at lunch,
more coke and then a fifth before bedtime.<br>
The only reason I didn't get fired from my job was because my boss knew I
had a problem and wasn't willing to do anything about it.<br>
I was the boss and I knew I had a problem.

<p>
DUI the 1st and I lied  all the way through the alcohol/drug evaluation,
secured the services of the best lawyer in town, who had the charge reduced
to Reckless Operation, and done. Done. And all this for only $4500.00. It
was never going to happen again.<br>
DUI the 2nd eight months later and there was no avoiding some major
consequences.<br>
$6000.00 this time with Lawyer fees and fine, a year suspension of my
license, a year of supervised probation (drug and alcohol tests are all it
amounted to really)  and no jail time if I'd commit to a 30 day Rehab. DEAL!
Rehab lead me to AA where I was indoctrinated into the program and as part
of my probation I went for an entire year.

<p>
I hated it.<br>
I hated the cliche slogans, the pithy sayings, the pat answer that wasn't
an answer at all. For every and any question you asked, these smug bastards
seemed to have a Chinese fortune cookie answer.<br>
I wanted to be sober and stay sober. I DIDN'T want to be told to &quot;keep
coming back&quot; or that &quot;it works when you work it.&quot;<br>
I wanted to know what you did at 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon
after working outside in 90 degree weather and the only thing you can think
about is how good a tall ice cold glass of Bourbon and water would taste
right about now. &quot;Call your sponsor&quot; Yeah, I tried that. The worthless shit
said he'd call me right back. Then didn't. &quot;You need to not be so selfish?&quot;
REALLY!?!?

<p>
I hated it.<br>
I hated the 12 Steps, the &quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, the &quot;searching and
fearless&quot; puke up that is the 4th step. I REALLY hated the reliance placed
on that unprovable, childish and rather silly hypothesis that I call god.<br>
(As if some omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, omnibenevolent &quot;god&quot;, the
creator of the fucking universe, is going to change its plan just because I
asked. I mean, if god has it all in control, why would he make someone an
alcoholic drug addict in the first place? Then its going to change me
because I'm sick of drinking all the time. REALLY!?!?

<p>
I started drinking again as soon as I cleared from the Department of Adult
Probation. Worse than ever. No dope but twice the booze. Binge drinking
now. It wasn't pretty and I could safely say it was the worst period of my
life.<br>
I went an entire week, I took vacation, and didn't draw a sober breath.<br>
I told my sponsor I &quot;slipped&quot;. He told me to work the steps.

<p>
I finally had enough when he told me I had to rewrite my 4th step. He told
me I wasn't being brutally honest enough.<br>
So I made up a total load of shit.<br>
If I recall it involved 30 or 40 extra marital affairs, have you ever been
really really drunk and coke wired out of your mind? Sex just ain't
happening. Even if the will was there the ability is somewhere else. LOL<br>
A murder in an alley, the molestation of sundry farm animals and a bank
robbery.<br>
Okay I'm making the last three up but I did pile on a load of crap to make
my 4th step more &quot;interesting&quot; and, he told me to rewrite it one more time.<br>
Sorry Rob, fuck you.

<p>
And I quit and then, in less than a month I quit drinking. Almost as soon
as I quit going to AA!

<p>
I was watching the movie <i>Little Big Man</i>. Caught it late on a Friday night
on a cable channel. Drunk, of course. Are you familiar with it? Dustin
Hoffman, Faye Dunaway...anyway.<br>
There's a scene in that movie where the Wild Bill Hickok character looks at
Dustin Hoffman who is shit faced drunk in the street, wearing rags, covered
in mud, sucking on a bottle of whiskey and Bill Hickok says to him &quot;Hell
hoss, I know any goddam fool can drink hisself to death.&quot;

<p>
I basically had the same type of experience as you did, Orange. I made up
my mind I was NOT going to die like this.<br>
I finished off what I had that night, and have not had a drink or illegal
drug in over eight years.

<p>
Sorry this went on so long. Keep up the good work.

<p>

Hello Timothy,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and please don't appologize for the length. It's a great letter, and
wouldn't have been as good if you cut it shorter.
<p>
I can only agree. It's a national tragedy, the nonsense and heretical religion that gets passed off
as &quot;treatment&quot; for drug and alcohol problems.
<p>
And then to sentence people to such quackery and cult religion is not only illegal,
it's unConstitutional.  And it's also counter-productive. Alcoholics Anonymous
drives people away from recovery.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">It also drives them to drink</a>.
<p>
And congratulations on getting your life together and kicking the addictions.
That's great.  But of course you already knew that.

<p>
It is more than a coincidence that you quit A.A. meetings and quit drinking and
drugging at the same time. I've heard so many people say that A.A. meetings made
them want to drink. And I've experienced it myself.  I would leave A.A. meetings
thinking about getting a fifth and really tying one on, when I had been fine
before going into the meeting. Fortunately, I only thought about it, and didn't
really do it.  But I was thinking about it. I could taste it in my throat already.
And N.A. meetings made me think about getting a load of dope and getting really
high. Funny how that works.
<p>
Here are some letters that complained about the same problem:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters106.html#want_to_drink" target="_blank">&quot;I feel like their way of dealing with alcohol addiction is just by having sex with each other. Being in that group made me want to drink more.&quot;</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters127.html#thinking_about_it" target="_blank">You usually leave
wanting to drink more than ever. In fact, you could go in there  feeling
good and wanting to remain abstinent, but now after all those glorious war
stories, you want to drink for the hell of it!</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters215.html#want_to_drink" target="_blank">
I have had far less desire to drink now that I am away from attending 12
step meetings or online 12 step 'program' meetings.</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters338.html#want_to_drink" target="_blank">
I worked the Steps twice only to relapse, and just going
to meetings made me want to drink or use</a>

<p><li>
<a href="orange-letters94.html#want_to_drink" target="_blank">
I used to sit in the car outside of meetings,
scared to death to go in, and I would leave feeling worse than I came in &#8212; and
usually would go drink.</a>

</ul>

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Thank you<br>

<p>
I joined AA in 2006 after a divorce and some destructive drinking. I didn't stay
long. The jargon and the stepford wives feeling I got drove me away for another
year.

<p>
In 2007, I was lonely, and since I have a positive history with the Search For God
meetings through the ARE, I went bak to AA. All of my friends, even my young
daughter, told me they didn't think I was an alcoholic. I told them I needed the
spiritual support of a group to stay sober.

<p>
That year I was mostly hit on by older men. I never connected w the females,
although I did try. I could only attend noon meetings since I have a disabled son
who requires total care, so that was part of it.

<p>
I left. Off and on I would return, but I felt bad that I just never caught on to the
correct way to &quot;share&quot;. I didn't attend enough meetings to really get it.

<p>
Reading through your site validates what I was thinking. Fortunately, I could never
swallow what they were pushing.

<p>
Looking forward to reading more.

Hello Carolyn,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I am glad to hear that you have your eyes open and are
seeing what is happening.  And I hope that you are feeling better now.
<p>
By the way, I got the same &quot;wrong sharing&quot; thing too. When I went to
an A.A. meeting many years ago to pick up my 6-month sobriety coin,
 I &quot;shared&quot; that I was really happy to
be sober, and that being healthy felt so much better than being sick.
I got subtle frowns because my sharing was not negative enough. They wanted tears
and confessions and misery and me moaning about how bad I am and how good my sponsor
is. (I didn't even have a sponsor.)

<p>
Isn't it really very odd how they didn't want to hear a happy success story?
I wonder if what they really want is to hear that everybody else is just as bad as them.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	A few questions<br>

<p>
I have read you papers and agree with much of what you say. That being said I go by
the adage whatever works is ok. One size does not fit all. Everyone is able to
decide for themselves which way they want to handle their lives and problems, be it
AA or any venue that works. That being said you are counter productive in that
regard. No one knows who you are or what your real agenda is. Do you drink? Do you
believe that people have the right to choose which path they wish take? Everything
is relative regarding recovery if that is their goal.  There are no absolutes. The
biggest problem I have is that recovery has become an industry sold by various
corporations to make money. There are so many variables regarding this issue.
Perhaps we should meet some time an discuss it over a few beers.

<p>
Martin

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Martin,
<p>
Thank you for the letter.
<p>
I agree that everyone should be able to choose his own path or method of recovery.
What is not okay is having lying frauds selling fake cures.
How would you like it if you discovered that some grinning con artist was selling your mother quack
medicine for a serious illness?
<p>
The propaganda trick you are using in your letter is called
<a href="#escape_via_relativism" target="_blank">Escape via Relativism</a>,
as in, &quot;It's just one opinion versus another, and any opinion is just as valid as any other.&quot;
Not so. Some opinions are based on facts and evidence, and some opinions are based on superstition, ignorance,
and stubborn refusal to see the truth.

<p>
You said,
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Everything is relative regarding recovery if that is their goal.  There are no absolutes.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is wrong, completely, totally wrong. There are lots of absolutes, like &quot;Two plus two equals four.&quot;
The answer is absolute and will always be four.
The answer will not be three or five if that's what you like.
And whether somebody is dead or healthy is not just a matter of your opinion versus my opinion.
<p>
And there certainly is such a thing as harmful quack medicine. Cyanide koolaid is not a cure for the
common cold. Colloidal gold is not a cure for cancer.

<p>
And there are solid facts regarding recovery, including the fact that Alcoholics Anonymous is a fraud, quack medicine
and cult religion
that hurts more people than it helps. Even a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dr. and Prof. George E. Vaillant,
found that A.A. did not cure anybody, but it did raise the death rate in alcoholics.
And he proved that while he was trying to prove that A.A. works.
You can read the whole story
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
And here is a list of methods of recovery where Prof. William Miller and his crew
at the Center for Alcohol, Substance Abuse and Addictions at the University of New Mexico
rated various methods of recovery:<br>
<a href="orange-letters177.html#what_works" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-letters177.html#what_works</a><br>
Note that A.A. and &quot;twelve-step facilitation&quot; are so far down the list that you have to look for them,
at numbers 37 and 38 in effectivenss. Also, they have a very negative rating.

<p>
Lastly, telling the truth about the real failure rate of A.A. is not &quot;counterproductive&quot;.
Telling people the truth, so that they can make informed choices, is a good thing to do.
<p>
Oh, and your question, &quot;Do I drink?&quot; is actually irrelevant to a discussion of whether A.A. works
as a cure for alcohol abuse or alcohol addiction.
Nevertheless, I'll answer your question, and the answer is, &quot;No, I don't drink at all.
None whatsoever. I have over 12 years of continuous unbroken sobriety now, and I did it without A.A.&quot;
If you wish, you can read all of the details of the story
<a href="orange-letters331.html#bio" target="_blank">here</a>.
You can find all of the autobiographical information there.

<p>
So, no, we won't meet and discuss it over a few beers. Been there, done that, and those days are gone
forever.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:        Re: A few questions<br>

<p>
Ok,
<p>
I'm listing you under the category of you are  smarter then I thought you were. But
so am I.  You originally interested me because I read your manifesto and even though
I'm not a manifesto guy agreed with most of it. The individual that I find more
intriguing then you is Stanton Peele. At least he doesn't hide under a mask. That
being said I stopped drinking a number of years ago then started again socially.  I
am comfortable with that. I found that people change and have the ability to take
control of their lives as they mature. I also believe that 12 step AA for fee based
recovery programs are big business that are taking advantage of an opportunity to
make a big buck at the expense of the people they are allegedly pretending to help.
When there is money to be made business will come out of the woodwork to try and
capitalize on it.  You Should probably have a cocktail once in a while, it probably
won't kill you. Thanks for the reply.

<font color="blue">
Hello Martin,
<p>
Thanks for the reply.
<p>
I don't have a &quot;manifesto&quot;. I'm simply laying out the facts.
<p>
I do not hide behind a mask. I use the pen name Orange because I've been using it for so
many years that some people know me by no other name. My birth name is Terrance Hodgins
and I live in rural Oregon west of Portland, and I've said that on my web site many, many times.
I already pointed you to
<a href="orange-letters331.html#bio" target="_blank">all of the
autobiographical information</a>. That isn't hiding behind a mask.
I've revealed a huge chunk of my life story there.

<p>
I agree that having so-called &quot;treatment centers&quot; selling the 12-Step cult religion as a cure for the
&quot;disease of alcoholism&quot; is a criminal racket.

<p>
I totally agree that <font color="black"> &quot;people change and have the ability to take
control of their lives as they mature.&quot;</font>
That explains the entire apparent A.A. success rate. A.A. merely
steals the credit for those people who were going to quit drinking anyway.
A.A. does not cause people to quit drinking, or keep them sober.

<p>
Lastly, no I should not have a cocktail now and then. Apparently you don't understand that some people
have a genetic or psychological disposition to addiction to alcohol, and those people should never drink alcohol.

<i>SOS Sobriety, The Proven Alternative to 12-Step Programs</i> by James Christopher</a>,
and especially check out the interview with Dr. Kenneth Blum, titled
&quot;The Fickle Gene&quot;. Blum discovered
<a href="orange-coffee.html#Blum" target="_blank">one of the genes</a>
that appears to contribute to alcoholism, and perhaps also a
tendency towards drug addiction.
<p>
By the way, I've already tried moderate drinking, and it did not work for me, because it never stayed moderate.
But total abstinence is easy for me to do. See:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

<p>
Oh, and what would be the goal of me having a cocktail now and then? To make me care less?
To make me cool down and stop telling the truth? To readdict me? What?

<p>
Have a good day now.

Subject:  	Hi<br>

<p>
First, I would like to apologize in advance for any misspellings and errors. English
is my second language.

<p>
I still reading your page and looks very interesting. A couple of year ago, I lost
someone very dear to me to a cult.

<p>
I been wondering, is the information given by you on the page is of your making? Are
they your conclusions?
Your background is on this kind of subjects? Are you a cult survivor?

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Ismael

Hello Ismael,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the questions. I'm sorry to hear about the friend that you lost to a cult.
Yes, those things are insidious, aren't they?
<p>
The answers to your questions are, yes,
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">the Cult Test</a>
and the writings about cults are of my own creation. I studied a lot of books about cults for many years, and I also
had a lot of personal experiences with cults back in the nineteen-sixties and -seventies.
Now I never got hooked into a cult and gave it my mind and my soul &#8212; so I'm not a cult survivor in
the bad sense &#8212; but I learned a lot about them.
At that time, many phony gurus were coming over here from India and Japan and Korea, and many more
phonies and fake gurus were popping up in the USA, and I checked out all of them that I could because I was very
interested in new-age spirituality. Back then, I didn't know how many of them were cults.
I thought that those new groups were just wonderful
new-age Eastern religions, something new to explore.
So I innocently wandered from one to another, learning, and seeing what they were about.
But somehow, I never quite &quot;married&quot; one, and gave it my heart and my soul. Or my mind
and my life. Something would feel a
little &quot;off&quot;, so I would just wander down the road to another one.
Or sometimes it was just chance, because I moved on and couldn't get to a group any more.
Little did I know what grief I was avoiding.
It was 10 or 20 years later before I learned how many of them were really cults.


<p>
The list of books about cults is in the &quot;Cults&quot; section of the bibliography here:<br>

<p>
Its been Many years since Iv had any AA contact , I can attribute my
salvation to the orange papers . Most of all a orange . You opened my eye's
to the cult and emboldened me to step out of the  AA bubble
and applied myself to life again . If I can be of any service to you this
would be a good way to repay my debt .
<p>
Years of working on other men's issues has made me cynical and I do wish to
return to the roots of my Enlightenment .
<p>
Thank you Joseph

Hello Joseph,

Subject:  	Hi,I survived AA.<br>

<p>
Hi Folks,
<p>
10 years ago and after hospital trips, this 34yr old was scared and desperate, the
internet still pretty hopeless
and my local herbal detox centre<br>
http://www.directionsact.com/arcadia<br>
suggested doing aa just to fill some time and to get out.
<p>
This was only suggested for my first few visits ,the centre applied for a funding
application. one of the conditions was to
force people to go to aa or na,so along we went..... only to see grim,white knuckled
corpses telling me how good it was to be sober.
the white knuckle corpse was celebrating his 50th, from shitscared to deathly scared
in an instant, I was asked to share and just walked out,
I rolled what looked like a ciggy and waited to be taken back...
<p>
That was my intro to aa,I kept going back for something to do...I could control the
situation in there...by saying nothing,remembering when I mentioned hospital
I meant the Psych unit...where after the suicide attempts saw me face to face with a
prominent Psychiatrist.....no more than a meter apart..
<p>
Can you see why I chose aa?
<p>
With baggage already packed (haha) I moved from Canberra to Sydney and the socially
depressed western suburbs where Wesley Mission had dry housing
and programs designed to stop the drinking,this housing was an umbrella to WM and
run by bornagains or your fundamentalists.
<p>
AA wasn't pushed, however, favour was found if you attended.... so, being a control
freak and after the previous guy lost interest, I took over, dimmed the lights, used
oil burners and around the outside, the chairs
nice and cosy, the newage music helped as well, I wanted a campfire feel and it
worked, it allowed people to open up.
<p>
To cut a long story shortish, I told these cunts to get fucked, I'd sold my house
previously and bought in Sydney city and needed something more.

<p>
I did a few meetings and decided my life was in greater danger walking at night to
the meetings (yep,I know some excuses) and started drinking again, bloody lovely city
to get pissed in BTW and after 2 years of this and another trip to detox, this was at
St Vincents Hoz in Darlinghurst and where I saw a leaflet to do some cognitive
therapy...
<p>
a little more drinking and then the desperate phone call that changed my life, it was
to the SMART program...................................
<p>
So, after 6yrs of CT and a year on my own, I'm a very pissed off over aa and their lies.
<p>
I started reading the OP some time ago, now I feel I must devote some time to at
least make people understand the erroneous nature of aa..
<p>
They will need to kill me to stop me.
<p>
Richard.

Hello Richard,
<p>
Thank you for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well now. And I'm also glad
to hear that you are interested in spreading the truth. Welcome, come on in, the water's fine.

So have a good day now, and a good life.
