Hello Mr. Orange I was just mailing you to voice my opinion. You cannot say that the
sucess rate is 0 when AA has helped millions. That is a proven fact. You riticule
good people as I was once told dont beleive everything you read and that appears to
be the reason as I read here and thanks fpr your opinion but millions would beg to
differ.

Hello Brenda,
<p>
No, it is not &quot;a proven fact&quot; that &quot;AA has helped millions&quot;.<br>
Where is the proof? There is no proof.<br>
<p>
The A.A. headquarters will not even say what the A.A. success rate is.

<p>
So I'll give you the opportunity to do it:
<p>
<font color="#9F0000" size="+1">
<center><b>What is the A.A. success rate?</b></center>
</font>
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many finally pick up a one-year coin for a
year of sobriety?<br>
A 5-year coin?<br>
Ten years?<br>
Twenty years?
<p>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
<p>
Then compare those numbers to
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#remission_rate">the normal rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholics</a>, which is about 5% per year.
That is the success rate of people who go it alone and quit drinking by themselves,
without any A.A. or other &quot;help&quot;.

<p>
What you will see is that A.A. does not increase the sobriety rate of alcoholics
at all. Zero percent improvement.
<p>
So much for A.A. &quot;helping millions&quot;.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
You like to read a lot into to the big book,
that is your right.

<p>
what about the people who are happy in their sobriety?

<p>
when did you ever try AA?

<p>
how many years did you suffer from uncontrolled drinking?

<p>
what did &quot;you feel like &quot;when every earthly thing you ever had ,
was taken from you as a result of &quot;your own &quot;consumption of alcohol?

<p>
how did you feel in the end of your battle with the bottle?

<p>
what method did you employ to return from the depths of suicidal despair ?

<p>
as a member of AA and a recovered alcoholic, I agree bill was sick and will also
concede that some individuals &quot;sick ones&quot; find their way into our fellowship
and intend to do harm ,all organizations are vulnerable to this.
to condemn AA wholly for the digressions of a few has the power to
drive away potential members and that would be sad if they need and want this.

<p>
Some of the things ,that happen at meetings are wrong the crazy pushy old timers
that bully new members is not attractive ,some are only their for their own sick sexual
compulsions ,and as of late we do not have a success rate worthy of our destinction as
&quot;the greatest social phenomenon of the twentieth century&quot; we do how ever where I got
help (sober)

<p>
have a sincere  desire to be of help to any body who might have the illness as we
see it
only a person who has been to the bottom in their own mind due to alcohol
consumption will
realey see the simplicity and effectiveness of avoiding one drink for one day ,and
to respond emotionaly
to the day we are living in &quot;one day at a time&quot;, we who have had genuine success
with AA sobriety will
be happy to openly discuss any part of AA ,as it can be applied to an individuals
desire to remain sober
we have nothing to hide and are no cult ,we have no leadership other than compliance
to our traditions
and at that we have no appointed authority to see to even that ,only by our own
individual desire to
participate on what ever level we decide will AA carry on .we as I've been taught we
(AA) are only &quot;one&quot; way to
deal with an age old problem ,my sponsor has made it perfectly clear to me his
suggestions are just that
and I'm free to do as I please ,his motive for taking the time ,is only to carry the
message of sobriety
one day at a time to me ,....this he say's he does to ensure his own sobriety one
day at a time.

<p>
Maybe it &quot;is&quot;.....all just bullshit and we are all a bunch of crazy yahoo's that
have missed the boat in life
that being said , I will continue to (after ten year's continuous , first time) take
my way of responding to life's certain up's and down's ...free from alcohol
rather than the way I was ,for eighteen years .without AA, hopefully  no one close
to you is currently suffering from compulsive drinking
the way I have ,because the living hell on earth that....that is ,is not nesescery
for anyone to endure.

<p>
we are not perfect ,but we are what is available to those who want it.

<p>
maybe you could tell a little about you sucsessful victory over a serious compulsive
drinking disorder.

<p>
feel free to contact me with any response you see fit to forward.

Hello Jordan,
<p>
The answers to your biographical questions are here:

<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-intro.html">Intro to A.A.</a>
<li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#treatment_program">Bait-and-switch treatment</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters10.html#missing">Friends driven away from

<li> <a href="orange-letters18.html#biography">who are you</a>
<li> <a href="orange-letters50.html#who_r_u">who are you, again</a>
</ol>

<p>
To make a long story short, yes, I've been through the mill too. Drank too much
for 18 or 20 years, lost everything, ended up homeless. Been there, done that.
<p>
And then I snapped out of it and quit drinking. I think I was helped a lot by
a doctor who said, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
I chose to quit drinking and not die. That was 8 years ago.
I also quit all drugs, so now I have 8 years clean and sober.
I even quit smoking so that I could really recover.

<p>
So you can forget the debating technique where you try to imply that I don't really
know about alcoholism.
<p>
You want to know how I quit drinking? I just quit. I just decided that I wasn't going to
die that way, and I just quit. I quit without A.A., and in fact, quit two weeks
before I ever got to an A.A. meeting. The story is
<a href="orange-letters112.html#any_room">here</a>.

<p>
If you are happy in A.A., then have fun. Enjoy. It's a free country, and you
can join any cult religion you like.  I'm not writing about the
people who are having a good time.
<p>
<ul>
<li> I'm talking about the people who are
shoved into A.A. under one guise or another, and given old quack medicine when
they need real help.
<li> I'm also talking about the
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">women and girls who get 13th-Stepped</a>
when they are supposed to be getting help with sobriety.
<li> And I'm talking about the people who are given grossly wrong misinformation
about alcoholism, falsehoods that make sobriety harder.
<li> And I'm talking about the people driven to suicide when they are told
not to take their doctor-prescribed medications.
<li> And I'm talking about the people who get their minds messed up by the
constant put-downs and insults and confession sessions.
<li> And I'm talking about the alcoholics who are harmed by A.A. &#8212; 
<ol>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">increased rate of binge drinking</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">increased cost of hospitalization</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">increased rate of rearrests</a>.
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">increased death rate</a>.
</ol>
<li> And I'm talking about the people who are sentenced to A.A. meetings.
</ul>

<p>
You didn't bother to mention those aspects of Alcoholics
Anonymous while you were praising it.
<p>
You have regurgitated a whole lot of the standard A.A. dogma and propaganda,
but the one thing you have not said is that Alcoholics Anonymous actually
increases the amount of sobriety in this world.
You have not said that the A.A. program makes alcoholics quit drinking.
You have not supplied a shred of evidence to show that A.A. actually works.
<p>
You imply that A.A. works, and use phrases like,
<font color="black">&quot;we who have had genuine success
with AA sobriety&quot;</font>,
but that is just deceptive language that hides the fact that
the vast majority of people who go to A.A. do not stop drinking.
You ignore the huge numbers who don't have &quot;genuine success with AA sobriety&quot;.
<p>
So I'll give you a chance to answer the question I asked in the previous letter:
<p>
<font color="#9F0000" size="+1">
<center><b>What is the A.A. success rate?</b></center>
</font>
<a href="orange-letters118.html#helped_millions">Look here</a> for the rest of the question</a>.

Have a good day.

Hi Mr Orange,

<p>
I sent the below email the beginning of the year and haven't heard back, or seen it
appear on your site. Hopefully the CIA or someone hasn't locked you up for telling
the truth hehe. Anyway, there was a program on TV last night in the UK called &quot;Am I
Normal&quot;.. very good viewing I felt. You should look up the gentleman named Jeffrey
Shaler. His book &quot;Addiction is a choice&quot; looks like it might be worthy reading. He
basically put it that people who become addicted choose to become addicted and
people naming addiction as an illness are enabling people to shun responsibility for
their own actions. I totally agree with this line of thinking and have thought this
way for some time...

<p>
Anyway got to go home..

Hi Mr Orange,

<p>
I'm so glad I found your site. Made me realize that my own person struggle was real,
worthwhile and not a joke. I'm an ex-drinker, and by many people around me
considered an alcoholic. I myself believed, no believe I'm an alcoholic as well. I
think drinking a bottle of whiskey a day plus beers is well within the realms of
alcoholic. Ok, I held down a job, could drive a car, have sensible conversations and
led quite a &quot;normal&quot; life. I just drank far too much. One day after 7 years almost
no-stop drinking I woke up and decided I'd had enough of it, so I quit. No rehab, no
therapy or AA meetings. I don't even know if we have such a thing in the UK. I've
not touched a drop for nearly 5 years, and never will again. I don't NEED drink.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mat,
<p>
Thanks for visiting. I agree totally. I also qualify as an alcoholic, but I don't
NEED a drink. In fact, I'm living quite happily now, and I have about 8 1/2 years
off of alcohol (and also off of drugs and cigarettes, too, just for good measure).
<p>
By the way, watch out for the definition of the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
A.A. routinely uses three different meanings of the word, and mixes them up, which clouds
the issue. I described the definitions
<a href="orange-letters90.html#alcoholic_defs">here</a>.
</font>
<p>
Now, I'm a member of facebook, and I looked for a group for people who were
alcoholics drinking, or &quot;reformed&quot; alcoholics. I found one group just called
straight &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;. I requested to join and was accepted. I had a look
at the conversations taking place, and immediately felt these people were suffering
on a different level to what I ever had. They were struggling every minute to not
take a drink, it was constantly on their minds, and always around the next corner.
They were pitiful. People who had quit for 6 months were literally having to be hand
held to stop them relapsing in a bottle. People openly admit they NEED to drink,
even WANT to drink. I said hello, said my piece about my life, drink and how I quit.
I stated that I thought that by their standards I'm probably not an alcoholic. I
felt this because my struggle seemed nothing to theirs. I offered my help to anyone
willing to take it..

<p>
<font color="blue">
One of the big problems with Alcoholics Anonymous is that they obsess with alcoholism.
It becomes the center of their lives. Instead of drinking all day long, they think about
drinking &#8212; all day long.
<p>
And then they convince themselves of nonsense like that they are
&quot;powerless over alcohol&quot;, and &quot;in danger of getting triggered&quot;,
and full of &quot;defects of character&quot; and
&quot;moral shortcomings&quot;, and only surrender to &quot;Higher Power&quot; will save them.
<p>
It's very damaging, really.
It's enough to drive you nuts.
<p>
Personally, I like to do things like get out in the sunshine, and see the beauty of
the world, and work on my suntan, and play the guitar, and go feed the geese and
ducks and cute little goslings and ducklings down at the river.
<p>
If it weren't for answering letters to this web site, I wouldn't even think about
alcohol for days at a time. It just isn't a part of my life any more. Not any more
than smoking cigarettes.
I'm just doing other things now, and enjoying better health.
</font>
<p>
The next day I looked on their and saw they had some photos on the group. I took a
look. They were mostly religious mantras about putting faith in god and that you
won't manage without his help. Now I'm not a religious man, I don't know if you
are... but I didn't use &quot;faith&quot; to &quot;heal&quot; myself. I just decided I was going to kill
myself with drink if I continued and I couldn't let that happen. I'm in fact very
suspicious of religious spreading outside of the church into not so covert places
and trying to convert people at any cost. I suddenly felt worried, even repulsed by
this group. But I was yet to find the worst part of the AA cult. The 12 steps. I've
never heard of them until now, and after reading them my jaw dropped. No wonder the
people on this group were so, well.. pathetic. These steps trap them. I cannot see
how these steps could help anyone quit drinking. The first six month after I quit I
didn't surround myself with people who were struggling to stop drinking, banging on
about how I'm incapable of quitting on my own. I didn't go to the pub, but I did ask
my friends to arrange social meetings away from drinking. I got a new job. I didn't
sit and feel sorry for myself as they seem to do. I actually took pleasure in the
change I felt in myself. I felt proud. To be honest about AA.. it scares me. It
scares me that someone decided to take this group of people and make them smaller
than they already were. I feel sick when I see how pathetic they have become because
of the 12 steps and AA meetings. I feel I want to help them escape this insanity,
but I know that once in one of these &quot;cults&quot; there is no turning back.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I also didn't use &quot;faith&quot; to quit drinking, other than faith in myself.
I had quit drinking before, a dozen years earlier, and stayed sober for three
years, so I knew I could do it again. So I did. Actually, at first, I was telling
myself, &quot;Three months, just quit for three months to get your health back together
and get back on your feet.&quot; But after three months of sobriety, I was still so sick
that I knew I needed a year. At the one-year point, I decided to make it three years.
Eventually, I extended it to life. I just don't want to ever go back to that
nightmare again.
<p>
You are quite right that the 12 Steps don't help anyone to quit drinking.
They were designed by <a href="orange-rroot060.html">Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman</a>
as procedures for recruiting and indoctrinating new cult members.
(Actually, as is true of so many cults, Buchman didn't really entirely design them by
himself &#8212; he got a lot of his cultish practices from his mentor,
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Wright">Henry B. Wright</a> of Yale University.)
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">Bill Wilson just repackaged those practices</a> and edited
in the word &quot;alcohol&quot; and &quot;alcoholics&quot; in the first and last steps,
and declared that these cult religion routines were &quot;spiritual principles&quot; that
would make alcoholics quit drinking. They don't work.
They never worked.
<p>
And yes,
<a href="orange-cult.html">A.A. is a harmful cult</a>.
This line really rings true:
<font color="black">&quot;...someone decided to take this group of people
and make them smaller than they already were.&quot;</font>
<br>
Yes, A.A. just constantly puts alcoholics down. Now I know that
contradicts the the fairy tale that
A.A. wants to unselfishly help alcoholics, but A.A. actually pushes them towards suicide
with the constant denigration and condemnation, and then the mandatory
self-criticism and confession sessions.
I wrote a file about that:
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">The &quot;Us Stupid Drunks&quot; Conspiracy</a>.
As Penn &amp; Teller put it, &quot;A.A. has no respect whatsoever for 12-Steppers.&quot;
<p>
And definitely see the Penn &amp; Teller expos&eacute; of A.A.
It's very funny, and to the point.
You might find it on YouTube.

Thankfully I found your site, because now I know I was wrong to doubt myself. I'm an
alcoholic, not some sham. The difference is I did it the right way, my way, by
myself. They have fallen into the trap of AA, and that makes me sad.

<p>
Anyway, hope this email is of some use to you..

<p>
Many thanks

Thanks for the thanks, Mat. And did you know that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental">the Harvard Medical School reported</a>
that 80% of the alcoholics who successfully quit drinking for a year
or more do it alone, on their own, without any &quot;support group&quot; or treatment program?

So we are actually the vast majority, not unusual at all.

Have a good day and a good life.

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160513061927/http://DUIFoundation.org/">DUIFoundation.org</a> a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  I currently help
maintain and write content for the DUI Foundation to educate and prevent
against the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol and other
impairing substances. The DUI Foundation website contains a database of
knowledge covering health issues, legal information, current news and events
updates, information details on support programs, as well as research and
many other helpful resources.

<p>
At <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160513061927/http://DUIFoundation.org/">DUIFoundation.org</a>, we hope to reinforce the idea that a single drunk
driving accident can permanently have a negative impact on you, passengers
in your vehicle, and anyone else involved in the disaster (drivers and
passengers in other automobiles and even pedestrians).

<p>
I am asking you to support our cause and spread our message through adding a
single-text link which links back to our site. We could also further offer a
content article about driving under the influence to educate your site's
visitors. Please help us in our mission to spread a message and prevent
life-altering decisions.

<p>
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing back from you!

<p>
Best Regards,

Subject:  	Parallels between AA and Scientology<br>

<p>
Hi Orange
<p>
I was interested to read the recent letter from someone who had been involved both
with 12 step groups and Scientology, pointing out similarities. This is probably not
the place to discuss the disturbing nature of Scientology in depth (a risky venture
due to the vindictive fanaticism of some of its adherents) and there are, of course,
many now involved in a campaign on this issue. I don't have a past involvement with
Scientology, but I have become quite interested in studying the life of L Ron
Hubbard and the history of his movement, as much as an example of psychopathology as
anything else.
<p>
You point out that Bill Wilson seems to fit the profile of someone who might today
be classified as having narcissistic personality disorder. This is also true of
Hubbard. Both men, whilst pretending to be concerned with helping people and
offering a form of constructive therapy, actually showed a cynical disregard for the
feelings and welfare of others. Both were self-aggrandising fantasists who
exaggerated their qualifications and attainments, although Hubbards lies and
exaggerations were a lot wilder than Wilson's, and hence more easily exposed. Wilson
was more subtle in his distortions of the truth, and his lies about himself, such as
that he was real professional stockbroker and highly educated, are almost
universally accepted as fact, and lend his pronouncements a bogus credibility
because he is percieved as having been a highly intelligent figure worthy of
respect, rather than a sly, cunning chancer.
<p>
I believe their are striking parallels between the two men's personalities. The fact
that Wilson was less obviously psychopathic than Hubbard, doesn't necessarily make
his legacy less dangerous.
<p>
For anyone interested in the subject I would highly recommend the books<br>
&quot;<a href="orange-top10.html#Atack">A Piece of Blue Sky</a>&quot; by Jon Atack and<br>

Hello Andy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
Oh yes, this certainly is the place to discuss the psychopathology of
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard.
I criticize him and his Scientology hoax a lot in
<a href="orange-cult.html">The Cult Test</a>.
<p>
And the points of similarity between Scientology and Alcoholics Anonymous are
a bit disconcerting, aren't they, considering how many people get sentenced to
A.A. meetings.
<p>
I've read both of those books that you listed, and found them to be very good.
I didn't know that they were now free on the Internet. That's good news.
<p>
Have a good day.

Dear Author,

<p>
This piece of work is excellent. I have been going to AA
on and off for 10 years and I totally agree with what is written here. A lot
of my views are the same. AA will convince you if you are an alcoholic even
if you are not. I could never get to grips with the 12 steps. When ever you
doubt AA they have an answer for everything although generally it's the
wrong answer. I will not be going back to AA as I feel that it is corrupting
my mind, also I don't think that I am alcoholic, but have a drink problem. I
have not been to AA for weeks now and feel better without it. It is not very
nice when people are telling you that you are suffering from a hopeless
condition of body and mind. I have still to digest a lot of this script, but
do believe its helping me.

<p>

Hello Peter,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. I'm glad to hear that you
are doing better.

 You probably know more than I do, where in the A.A. approved literature
 does
 it say you have to go to at least one A.A. meeting a day?
 I appreciate a thorough job, I really do. But a job usually has some sort
 of
 culmination.

<p>
<p>
<font color="blue">

Nowhere in the A.A. literature does it say that you MUST go to a meeting
every day (the Big Book suggests once or twice a week), but many A.A.
members insist that they have to do a meeting every day or they just can't
make it.  I know some of them.
<p>
But the A.A. member who really stands out in my mind is the woman who
bragged that this was her third A.A. meeting today.  Now that's obsessed.

<p>
Yup, I agree.

<p>
I don't believe it was the intent of the founders to have A.A. members go to
a meeting three times a day, although if that's where they're feeling safe,
I don't think it's a bad thing for a while. They have a saying for those
members who go to such an absurd amount of meetings well after they're out
of danger of drinking. It's, &quot;hiding behind the apron strings of A.A.&quot;

<p>
There are two principles in the A.A. Big Book that I think those people are
missing:

<p>
Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God and the
people about us. (pg 77)

<p>
and

<p>
We would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an avocation.
(Forward)

<p>
What I am suggesting is that there are some members of A.A. who are sicker
than others, but it's not fair to suggest that the entire program was
designed to be a &quot;cult&quot;. These folks are a representation of some of the
members of A.A., but they aren't representing the program as it was
designed. Actually, I doubt many of todays members are.

<p>
By the way, I am not familiar with the passage in the Big Book where it says
one or two meetings a week. Can you please point me in the right direction?
Thanks.

<p>

Hi again, Adrienne,
<p>
This is the quote that I was thinking of, that suggested one or two meetings a week:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In conclusion, I can only say that whatever growth or understanding
has come to me,
I have no wish to graduate.
Very rarely do I miss the
meetings of my neighborhood A.A. group, and my average has never
been less than two meetings a week.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>
Alas, I think it is fair to
<font color="black">
&quot;suggest that the entire program was
designed to be a 'cult'&quot;</font>, especially since it was the Oxford Group cult
even before Alcoholics Anonymous existed. That's what Bill and Bob were in,
and that's what they learned, and that's what they believed, and that's
what they practiced.  All that Bill Wilson did was break off
a branch of the Oxford Group cult and make it into his own cult, complete with
the same beliefs and practices.
So yes, it is what Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman designed it to be &#8212; a religious cult.
<p>
Bill Wilson actually changed very little when
<a href="orange-rroot030.html">
he substituted the word &quot;alcohol&quot; for the word &quot;sin&quot; in Buchmanism</a>,
and declared that this &quot;new organization&quot; and &quot;great spiritual discovery&quot;
was a never-fails cure for alcoholism.

<p>
Now I know that many of the current members are well-meaning and really want to
help other alcoholics. The problem is that they are using the wrong tools.
Dr. Frank Buchman's cult recruiting and indoctrination tools don't work to make
alcoholics quit drinking. Buchman's Oxford Group had a bad track record when it
came to sobering up alcoholics, too.
<p>
This quote:
<font color="black">
&quot;Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God and the
people about us.&quot; (pg 77)
</font>
kind of blows away the line about A.A. not being a religion, doesn't it?

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	AA's deus ex machina solution to addiction<br>

<p>
Dear Orange

<p>
I've been reading your website for quite some time now and wish to congratulate you
on both your sobriety (over 6 years!) and the amazingly informative (and pleasurable
to read) research that you have granted all of us AA refugees with.

<p>
Furthermore, you come across as a truly gentle, intelligent and kind-natured man;
the fact that you still maintain such good manners/politeness despite some horribly
abusive e-mails marks you out as a real gentleman, sir.

<p>
Regarding myself: as indicated, I tried AA; found that, due to my atheism, I
couldn't just cut and paste a theology of choice to fit within the narrow parameters
of the twelve steps; and always felt irreconcilable with the frankly moronic &quot;fake
it to make it&quot; clich&eacute; (sorry, but as a perhaps poor example, I also don't believe in
Santa Claus &#8212; and despite how many times I might wish to convince myself to the
contrary, it just isn't going to happen...).

<p>
To summarise: my real problem has always been AA's deus ex machina-ish solution to
recovery.

<p>
...Y'know: the whole thing about there being no other recourse other than divine
intervention as a solution to addiction...

<p>
AA says that it welcomes individuals of &quot;all shades of belief or disbelief&quot;; what a
load of baloney!!  All they are really about is coercive proselytism!!  There's
loads of AA stuff (especially in &quot;The 12X12&quot;) which is frankly absolutely
hostile/disrespectful in its attitude to atheists and agnostics!

<p>
I'm sad to say that I stuck AA longer than I should have, Orange.  The thing which I
could no longer stomach was just the whole &quot;Take the cotton wool out of your ears and
stick them in your mouth&quot; discouragement of using my critical faculties to attempt
to question the logic (or lack of therein) of the AA program.

<p>
So: at the moment I'm just trying to do the best that I can without AA; it's a daily
struggle, but I just keep telling myself that far from being powerless I'm actually
POWERFUL &#8212; that, unlike less evolved animals, I don't have to just obey whatever
urge seems to emerge at any particular time.  I think, for me, what makes things
difficult are the horrible, horrible black depressions and insomnia that I suffer.
In truth, the alcohol has always given me a sort of very short-term respite, I
suppose; however, having become addicted, it became a whole problem within itself.

<p>
Oh well, Mr. Orange, keep up the good work.  Thought I'd close with a selected quote
from wikipedia:

<p>
&quot;A deus ex machina is generally undesirable in writing and often implies a lack of
skill on the part of the author...&quot;

<p>
(LMFAO!!)<br>

P.S. I loved your baby gosling photos.

<p>
P.P.S. ...Here's a thought, Mr. Orange: I wonder what Richard Dawkins makes of the
12 step movement?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Gary,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Sorry to take so long to answer; I'm way behind on answering
email.
And thanks for the compliments. And just for the record, not to brag too much :-),
it's up to 8 1/2 years now.  How time flies when you are goofing off.

<p>
I couldn't agree with your letter more, even though I'm personally not an atheist.
But I sure don't believe in Santa Claus either. Personally, I think there is a
cosmic consciousness that is embedded in the fabric of this universe,
something that gives us consciousness. But that
is a very different kind of idea than many religions sell. That concept doesn't
make me buy into the standard dogma of religions that say that you
can get your wishes granted by praying. I can't help but remember how well that
worked for the Jews in Auschwitz.
<p>
In fact, the entirety of human history is filled with stories about people getting
slaughtered by the millions while praying for some deity to save them. If it isn't
Hitler, Stalin, or Ghengis Khan killing multitudes of people,
it's a volcano or tsunami or the Black Plague or a famine.
It's always something.
<p>
So the idea that some white American alcoholics will get saved from their booze
habit by praying for a deity to change reality to suit them strikes me as very childish
and unrealistic. (Not to mention selfish.)
Personally, I think that if there were such a God that
is actually capable of such
intervention, and so inclined, that He should work on saving the starving, sick, and
dying children in Asia and Africa before He wastes any time on self-indulgent
white Americans.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

<p>
Oh, and about Richard Dawkins &#8212; I love him, and have been watching his
lecture series on YouTube. There is a long multi-part lecture &#8212; I think Christmas
lectures at Oxford &#8212; where he gives his oversight of biology. Fascinating.
<p>
I would also love to hear what he has to say about Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
Have another good day.

<a name="goslings2"> </a>
<font color="blue">
<p>
P.S.: About the gosling photographs, I'm getting behind there too. I haven't even finished
the story about last year's goslings, and I got a new one three days ago.

<p>
April 30, 2009, Thursday: At Waterfront Park, Day 0.
<p>

 One little
gosling &#8212; maybe 2 or 3 days old &#8212; got orphaned when some children
chased the geese, and caught a gosling that belonged to a goose family that had
only one child, and the parents panicked
and flew away, leaving their baby behind. And they didn't come back. I guess they thought
that the baby got killed. But it wasn't killed. Somehow, the gosling got away, or some
adults made the children let the gosling go (I don't know which), and it wandered down to
the shore of the river.
<p>
 When I arrived, I found the gosling paddling around from
one female goose to another, asking the adult female geese to adopt it.
None of the other geese would adopt the baby &#8212; they snapped at it and
actually bit it and drove it away &#8212;  so
come the end of the day, I caught it and took it home, to keep
it from dying of the cold that night. Catching it was very simple: I just lured
it close by feeding it rice (that I had cooked for feeding to the other goslings),
and when it came within easy reach, I just gently grabbed it. The gosling is doing well.
<p>
This is the new gosling, in the first hours that I saw it. 
I am guessing that this gosling is 3 or 4 days old at this time.
I haven't named it yet, because I haven't figured out what sex it is.
<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
[LATER: I guessed that this baby is a female, so I named her Carmen.]

The new gosling &quot;Carmen&quot; in the Willamette River, 30 April 2009
</center>
<p>
It's been very chilly at night, and alone, the gosling wouldn't have made it through the night,
but she sleeps with me, and cuddles up against my neck, under my beard,
and chirps happily about being warm.
I decided to take the gosling to bed with me because I had to keep her warm at night,
and
I didn't have the right parts for making a good incubator, which has to be done just right,
or it might fall on the gosling and crush her or burn her. That could get really bad really fast.
Keeping the baby warm the natural way was much simpler and safer.
<p>
Besides, goslings
don't like being kept in a cardboard box, even with an electric heater.
They do know the difference between an incubator and a big live warm friendly body.
They don't trust the cardboard box to save them from a cat, but they do trust
me. And then a cardboard box just leaves them feeling lost and lonely, but they
don't feel that way when cuddling up with me.
<p>
Goslings that have to sleep alone cry a lot, like all night long,
because they are lonely and frightened, and all of their instincts tell them
that goslings that sleep alone will be cold and then get eaten by the cat. 
Goslings never sleep alone; they always sleep under their mother's wing.
<p>
Carmen was terrified when I first caught her, and shook and trembled in fear.
But she calmed down a lot within 15 minutes, because she noticed that I still had not bitten
her.
(That's kind of a big thing with them.)
Carmen relaxed and became less afraid with each passing hour, because I did nothing
but friendly gestures like feeding her and warming and cuddling her and talking to
her in a friendly manner.
<p>
So, as strange as it may seem, I took that gosling to bed with me.
I put some old towels down on her side of the bed because goslings do
poop a lot. It's just a baby, and that comes with the territory.
I turned off the lights, and positioned the gosling beside me,
and covered her with a hand,
and cuddled her and pressed her gently against my neck, which was nice and warm.
<p>
I think that was the moment when she really knew for sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that I meant her no harm.
A mother goose covers her babies with her wings, and cuddles them close
to her body and keeps them warm and safe at night, and when I put a hand over the
gosling and cuddled her against my neck, she clearly recognized the gesture.
Nothing else that I could have done would have told Carmen so clearly,
in easily-understood goose body language, what our relationship was,
and what my intentions were.
Carmen saw that I was treating her the way that a mama goose does,
and that I had no intentions of hurting her.
Carmen realized that she was in friendly hands, and that she was safe,
and that she was going to make it through the night.
<p>
As I drifted off to sleep, and my breathing slowed down,
the gosling started chirping so happily. Goslings have a cute little trill that they do
when snuggling up with Mommy, that sounds something like a gecko's trill,
that says,
&quot;Oh, I feel so warm and happy and cuddly and cozy and comfy.&quot; It seemed 
like the little thing serenaded me half of the night.
I half woke up at 2 or 3 in the morning, and the little thing was still chirping
happily.
<p>
However, the gosling insisted
on waking up at the crack of dawn (I mean, first light in the east,
not sunrise), and she nagged me to wake up too.
She was very insistent about me waking up. She was hungry, and she wanted me to
wake up and take her out for breakfast. She had an attitude like,
&quot;Hey, Foster Mother! Wake up! It's breakfast time and I'm hungry!&quot;
<p>
She started by pulling my hair, and then my beard and mustache, and
then (I swear she did this when I was still half-asleep) she body-slammed
me in the face. And beat on my face with her 
tiny wings. And then she pecked me on the nose and cheeks,
and pulled my eye-brows. The eye-brows are what did it. She has the ability to
get just four or five eye-brow hairs in her little beak, and give them a good
yank. Ouch! I felt that. She definitely managed to wake me up,
and wouldn't be ignored. She wanted breakfast at 5 AM. Yawn.
<p>
It's kind of amazing how in 12 hours that gosling could go from being terrified of me to
confidently hitting me in the face to wake me up, not worried about me hurting her.
When she woke up alive in the morning, she knew everything that she needed to know.
She knew that I could have killed her and eaten her during the night, but I didn't.
She knew that I could have hurt her, but I didn't. I had cuddled her and kept her warm and safe
through the night. That is the behavior of a mother, not a predator.
So her attitude changed into, &quot;Okay, Foster Mother. Wake up! It's breakfast time!&quot;

<p>
The second night, however, she got her biological clock all out of kilter. We took a lot
of naps during the day because I was tired from sleep deprivation &#8212;
waking up at the crack of dawn wasn't my usual schedule.
So we went to bed very early, like at 9:30 PM.
It guess the naps made Carmen feel extra rested, because at 12:30 AM she started insisting
that it was dawn, and time to get up. (Maybe the street lights outside fooled her.)
And of course she was doing the usual wake-up routine on me.
And she kept that up for hours. She is one determined little cuss. Yawn.
<p>
Still, mother and baby are doing well.

<p>
May 1, 2009, Friday: Day 1:<br>
The next day, I took the baby Carmen to the closest city park, called
&quot;the North Park Blocks&quot;, to eat grass and play.
She was already bonded with me to a great extent, and followed
me around &#8212; most of the time. But she was
still of two minds and a bit confused. Sometimes, like
when I reached for her, she panicked and ran from me, which got to be very dangerous,
because she nearly ran out into the street in front of cars three times.
Fortunately, I was able to stop her from running into the street, but just barely.
<p>
The gosling got over that fear in one day. She didn't do that the next day.

May 2, 2009, Saturday: Day 2:<br>
<p>
The weather was okay for some hours, so we went back to Waterfront Park, where the other
geese hang out. When the baby gosling Carmen saw the geese couples, she immediately ran away from
me and made a bee-line for a particular couple, and begged to be adopted.
The female said, &quot;No!&quot;, and snapped at the baby, and sent her away.
I called to Carmen with a &quot;honk!&quot;, and
she ran back to me, and I consoled her,
&quot;They wouldn't accept you? Well, I'll accept you.&quot;

<p>
During the next few hours, Carmen mingled with the flock of geese
 and eventually asked most of the adult female geese to be her mother, and they all
said, &quot;No.&quot;
Canada Geese rarely adopt orphans, especially the very young orphans.
 Oh, you may hear about
a few rare exceptions to the rule &#8212; there are some unusual goose couples that
will adopt orphans &#8212; but generally, the younger orphaned goslings die very soon,
like their first or second night alone.
The only ones you see surviving alone are the older orphans who are big enough to not die
of hypothermia at night, and lucky enough to stay out of the mouths of cats.

<p>
May 3, 2009, Sunday: Day 3:<br>
This gosling has adapted to her new situation amazingly well in just a few days.

graham cracker crumbs.
</center>
<p>
It is interesting to note here that when I was hand-feeding Carmen, when
she was only a few days old, she
insisted on filling her stomach three-quarters full of grass first, and then she
would fill the remaining space with cooked rice. She never deviated from that
ratio, and she always insisted on eating the grass first. She was actually
born (hatched) with a built-in idea of what constitutes good nutrition for her.

<p>
The biggest problem is
just that she is bored with being cooped up in an apartment. She wants to go
to a park and run around in the grass. That's tough, because it's been cold
and rainy for the last two days.  We got out anyway, but not as long as
this little creature would like.

<p>
When I say &quot;cooped up&quot;, that is just an expression. I don't
even own a bird cage. The
goslings that I care for just live with me. I arrange things so that they can't get
into too much trouble, and block off some areas, but they are never put in a cage.
They just live with me, and hang out with me, and sit beside me, or nest
in my lap. Still, they consider my whole apartment to be a small cage.
<p>
The gosling really is wildlife, and she really wants to be outdoors, with big
expanses of open space and grassy fields to browse.
Still, maybe in a few hours, the weather will dry out and
warm up enough.<br>

Sorry, this has not been my experience in 32 years.  sounds like you have lots of
hatred.

<p>
There is good and bad in everything, life, work, AA, churches.  Nothing is perfect,
and not one per ever discouraged me to not thing.  I was encouraged to share my
recovery with family, friends, work etc

<p>
In 32 years I have never seen what you have written.  I know someone who has not
gone to meetings for over 10 years and they still have friends that go to meetings,
and he is not hounded or criticized ever.

<p>
You are full of it.

Hello Kim,
<p>
What you are attempting there is the propaganda and debating trick
called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#escape_via_relativism">Escape via Relativism</a>.
As in:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Well, it's just one opinion versus another.
Your mileage may vary. I never saw anything wrong.
Your daughters may have gotten
raped at
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">the Midtown Group</a>,
but mine are okay, so it's a good group.
And your son may have been driven to suicide by A.A. dogma and constant
put-downs, but mine is just fine.
Heck, churches, schools, the government &#8212; everything is a cult. Nothing is perfect.&quot;
</font>
<p>
Such an argument is just an attempt to avoid the unpleasant facts of the matter,
and to minimize and deny the really bad features of Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
You are also trying to use the logical fallacy of,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;I didn't see it happen, so it didn't happen.&quot;
</font><br>
You think that one friend who isn't harrassed for not attending A.A. meetings
proves that it didn't happen to anyone else. That's very faulty logic.<br>
Like Carl Sagan said:
<i>&quot;Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&quot;</i><br>

<p>
Above all, since you have 32 years of experience with A.A., you have more than
enough time to answer this question that the old-timers have NEVER honestly answered:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later? (Or even several years later?)<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins? Ever?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
What percentage of the A.A. newcomers go on to get those things?
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
<p>
Lastly, you declared,
<font color="black">
&quot;sounds like you have lots of hatred.&quot;
</font>
<br>
Well, yeh, I kind of do &quot;have a resentment&quot; against dogmatic fools and
dishonest cons who foist quack medicine and very bad advice
on sick people, and occasionally kill some of those unfortunate sick people.
<p>
Do you believe that such criminal behavior is a good thing?
Do you have no &quot;resentment&quot; or hostile feelings towards people
who hurt other alcoholics like that?
<p>
(If not, then why not? What's the matter with you? Where is your moral outrage?)
<br>

<p>
Have a good day.
