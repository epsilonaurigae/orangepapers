From:  	ANONYMOUS<br>
Subject:  	Re: Why is Alcoholics is no longer effective?<br>

<p>
Orange,
<p>
I have been trying to find the salary  figures for Phyllis Halliday, GSO
general
manager and other staff members.  Amber Eden is the Managing editor of
the AA Grapevine, inc. I believe GSO is  non profit. The AA grapevine is
supposed to be self supporting through  subscriptions, but actually lost
$393,000
last year. LaVina the Spanish  edition has lost over a million dollars in
the
past 12 or so years. These  losses come directly or indirectly out of our
prudent reserve fund.
<p>
  I  am sure you know about the trustee set up, I just
learned that before  Phyllis H was hired to manage GSO in Jan 2009, she was
a trustee from the  pacific northwest. SHE WAS ON THE AA GRAPEVINE
BOARD. Using the &quot;comma which  was already in place, the AA Grapevine
has become of equal importance to the  General Service Office.
<p>
I have come
to believe that headquarters will remain  the same. And the groups will
never
change. We will stumble along for many  more decades failing the very
suffering alcoholics we are responsible to  be helping.
<p>
 Do you have access
to the I SAY FORUM AA GRAPEVINE?   Recently this was revised. It
was formally called the AA GRAPEVINE I SAY  FORUM. They tell me that
the new site is free but I had to pay $31.97 for a  subscription to the
ONLINE GRAPEVINE to access it. I have a dozen messages  posted.
It is not difficult to find which ones are mine.
<p>
I believe by  invoking
concept
seven and cutting off the money supply may be the only  solution. But
even that won't work, because &quot;they&quot; will find new and  innovative ways
to raise the money to support their salaries.
<p>
In a nutshell,  Alcoholics
Anonymous has become a strange religious cult at the group level.  Our
headquarters has become big business. It is so sad. We have taken
a  fellowship which in my case was very successful, and turned it
into a  strange religious cultist Fellowship, which causes more harm
than good.
<p>
 I do  believe that many at headquarters know who I am.
Sometimes fear creeps in and  I  think of just walking away. I am not
used to being outwardly  critical of anyone. I have always had such
a desperate need to have everyone  approve of me. What a handicap!
I have written hundreds of letters to any  address I can find.
<p>
Do You know that AA's  general service board is headed by Ward Ewing, an
Episcopal Priest?  He is AA's top leader, and dean of some seminary.
in New York. Does  that make sense, not allied with any sect? I wrote
him a couple of years  ago, when he wrote an article for the grapevine,
titled A VISION FOR US. I  questioned the title. Later he referred
to A VISION FOR YOU. I emailed a  couple of letters this year but
he continues to ignore me. His belief is  that we need new and more
innovative ways to reach the suffering alcoholic.  BULL!  Fifty years
ago Bill W wrote that practically everyone in America  has heard of
AA. The truth is that what they have heard about AA keeps them  from
approaching us. And what they have heard is  TRUE!
<p>
Sorry if I keep repeating myself. AA has failed  at least six million
suffering alcoholics plus their friends and families  over the last two
decades,
by the way meetings are conducted. Hundreds of  thousands are still
approaching
AA every year in spite of our reputation as a  religious cult. And we keep
pushing them away telling them to Find God and find  Him now! That reading
of HIW
at the beginning of AA meetings was the most  horrible blunder we ever made,
followed closely by the  chanting.
<p>
I will close with a little attempt to  explain the &quot;comma.&quot; Perhaps five
years ago
I was at a meeting and the topic  of how much laborious work is performed
by
our delegates at the conference.  She said the conference had spent hours
arguing over a simple comma. I forgot  about it until years later when I was
investigating the distortion of our  prudent reserve concept. There may be
more than one &quot;comma&quot;, but the one I  found gives the AA Grapevine
access to our prudent reserve emergency savings  bank account. One
&quot;emergency&quot; was the removal of staples from the Grapevine  and the
perfect bound finish, which adds considerably to the cost of the
magazine. Plus adding the graphics. And now I will close. Anonymous.
My  daughter updated the computer and explained the downloads and
now I can read  your mail.

Hello again, ANONYMOUS,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you got your computer problems solved. Now you can read the following stuff.
<p>
I don't know anything about the Grapevine Forum. That's a new one to me.

<p>
Both the GSO (really, GSB, General Service Board of Alcoholics Anonymous) and AAWS (Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc.), are non-profits. AAWS used to be a for-profit publishing company
that published and sold the A.A. literature.
AAWS was totally owned by the non-profit GSB.
But some years back, the A.A. leadership decided to quietly change AAWS into a non-profit company,
which conveniently means that they don't pay taxes any more. But that has the downside that now they have to file
public financial documents &#8212;  Form 990 &#8212;  which we can read.
And some time or other, the Grapevine became a non-profit too.

<p>
OK, fine.  How about this one......
<p>
What do you feel the odds are that in, say, a hundred years, The AA movement will be
essentially a religion?
<p>
I'm thinkin' that considering human nature it's a high probable,  especially if
their is another catastrophic event, like a nuke going off in a major city, or an
engineered pandemic.  I already see a big shift to the Right politically in AA,
especially with all the &quot;God talk&quot; one must endure at meetings. Hell,  LDS was
started by a serial pedophile, and Brigham Young is implicated in the massacre of a
wagon train of settlers transiting Utah.
<p>
Why not Saint Bill and Saint Bob?  (I like Bob better)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Vernon,
<p>
A.A. already is a religion. The only question in my mind is how long it will last.
A.A. is a cult in decline now, so I don't think it will survive in the long run.
I'm sure it will hang on by its fingernails for a while, and will probably fade out about
the same time as Scientology and the Moonies do.

<p>
I don't think A.A. will succeed like the Mormons. The thing that did it for the Mormons was the
commandment that thou shalt have all of the children that thou canst possibly have.
Outbreed the competition. All that A.A. has going for it is recruiting the sick people and addicts
and loonies.
That doesn't produce an ever-growing church, especially not when people discover that the claimed
cure doesn't work.

From:  	&quot;Tom W.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Hi Orange<br>

<p>
Just wanted to say hi, I enjoy reading your website... I have a look at it every few
days, have probably read through most of it now... wanted to rattle off a few things
that are on my mind, just for the sake of getting some of my thoughts out there.

<p>
I am a member of a 12 step fellowship (not AA or CA, or a substance misuse
fellowship for that matter)... I first joined it about a year ago, and left after a
month convinced I didn't need it, but three months later fell back into my old
behaviours, so I returned in January this year.... and since returning, whilst I
have not been 100% free of my behaviours (though they have drastically reduced in
frequency and intensity), I am in a much better frame of mind than I previously was.
In all honesty I would rather not be in a 12 step programme to get &quot;clean&quot;, and I
have tried to find excuses not to go to meetings, but can't stop myself from turning
up say, once a week...I just feel that if I don't go and keep talking to folks in
the &quot;fellowship&quot;, I feel I will end up losing control over my behaviours. I am not
fanatical about 12 step stuff though I do do some of the daily &quot;suggestions&quot;, the
ones that are palatable to me... and I do have a sponsor, but I am not that keen on
him (particularly after he advised me to go out and &quot;get&quot; some newcomers last week)
but still call him... thankfully he is about 100 miles from me.

<p>
It's kind of weird, I think this stuff helps despite how cynical I feel about 12
steppism. It's like I read your site, enjoy it more than say, the big book, and have
no issue with it because I can see where you are coming from, but I still feel that
without getting into daily habits that detract from my previous habits, I don't have
much of a chance of getting better. Plus I won't find any other f*cked up people
like me in a non-12 step fellowship (I don't think!)

<p>
Not sure what to do...I guess I am hoping that with time I continue to &quot;recover&quot; and
find myself turn out OK, and don't have to rely on the &quot;fellowship&quot; for a future
life of happiness... but  then at the same time, I would like to continue to help
folks that have spent years in the same horrible place that I crawled out of earlier
this year... but these people I will probably only find in a fellowship.

<p>
Horrible catch 22 really.

<p>
Cheers and have a good day,

<p>
Tom

<font color="blue">
Hello Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I'm glad to hear that you are doing better. You know, there is nothing wrong
with getting some moral support and encouragement from a group. That was the whole idea behind
group therapy, which really does help some people, in some cases.
 And as long as you can avoid getting brainwashed
into the worst beliefs of Steppism, you might do okay there.
You sound like you have a pretty good take on the situation.

<p>
The fear that you will lose control if you don't go to enough meetings does sound suspiciously
like
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias" target="_blank">standard cultish phobia induction</a>. I'd watch out for that.
But otherwise, your group sounds tolerable.

<p>
So have a good day and a good life now.

I am telling the truth. I am not lying. People are dying over this stuff, so somebody has

Nobody else can do it for you.

Out of pure curiosity, are you an alcoholic?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Prosody,
<p>
Well, I used to be an alcoholic. I don't think it is entirely accurate to continue to call
myself an alcoholic now, considering that I haven't had a drink in 10 years.
I used to drink far too much; now I don't.
<p>
Whenever people ask me if I'm an alcoholic, I have to ask them which definition they mean.
A.A. uses several very different definitions for that word, and mixes them up, which confuses
the issues.

<p>
We have talked about this before, so you can

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the link. Yes, that Kris Best is at it again. What a mess of A.A. slogans
and standard cult characteristics:

<p>
<ul>
<p><li> Only drunks could understand other drunks
<p><li> The alcoholic when helping other alcoholics manages to stay sober
<p><li> Nobody cares about &quot;status&quot; in AA meetings as they are all the same, with the same problem of Alcoholism.
<p><li> Some meetings are &quot;Tradition meetings&quot;.  This is where they share the thoughts, visions and history of AA.
<p><li> This 12 Step Program is the meat and potatoes behind AA.  If the AA member is faithful to the AA program and really works his 12 Steps, a transformation will take place. 
<p><li> To begin sharing, you state your name and, most importantly, that you are &quot;an alcoholic.&quot;  The alcoholics are encouraged to be rigorously honest with themselves and others.    By admitting in meetings that they are indeed &quot;an alcoholic&quot; gives them an opportunity to remind themselves daily and to be vigorous in warding off the disease of alcoholism.
<p><li> That is how AA works, by the members keeping each other in line. 
<p><li> &quot;I feel better after every meeting, so I go.&quot;
</ul>
<p>
Yes, that Kris really drank the koolaid.

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for that link. Yes, that is Scientology at its worst. They demand that Scientologists
&quot;disconnect&quot; from everybody who isn't a Scientologist, even family. And they blackmail people too.
What Scientology calls &quot;auditing&quot; is telling everything about yourself, every dirty little secret,
while holding a couple of tin cans that are connected to a lie detector (that they call an &quot;E-meter&quot;).
The &quot;auditor&quot; writes down all of those secrets in a file that can later be used to blackmail
the victim if he choses to leave Scientology, or worse, denounce it.

<p>
There really ought to be a law.

From:  	&quot;Tom M.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	AA bites.<br>

<p>
The latest phase in my deprogramming went off without a hitch. I went to a bar with
a work colleague last night. It must be my first time in a bar, in the evening time,
in a long time. Nothing happened. The bottles behind the bar didn't start talking to
me and telling me to drink, drink, drink. My &quot;powerlessness&quot; didn't overwhelm me and
compell me to imbibe alcohol against my will. I have a choice to drink or not to
drink. I always did.
<p>
It is amazing how deep the false beliefs of AA can embed
themselves in your psyche, how much fear of alcohol and drinkers and drinking
situations endless AA meetings instilled in me. I think it is a false fear.
<p>
I must
say that I did feel a bit awkward ordering a sparkling water in a bar, I feel like a
bit of a pussy, but if anyone says anything smart to me, my response shall be either
&quot;I am the designated driver&quot; or &quot;Mind your own f--king business&quot;. I don't think
being a non-drinker in a bar is as big a deal as I have made it in my own mind.
People have lots of reasons for not drinking, at any particular time, a barman isn't
going to automatically assume that you are a self-diagnosed alcoholic who is
brainwashed by a repackaged 1930's cult religion. Most people don't care whether you
drink or not. People who do care that you are a non-drinker, need to look at
themselves first.
<p>
I have a lot of regret and sadness about the missed opportunities
for socialising that I have experienced, because of my fear and holier-than-thou
attitude towards drinking and drinkers. I live in Ireland, the pub is a very big
part of the social scene here,if you stay away from pubs, you miss out on a lot. I
had more fun in one night out last night, than I did at 100 mind-numbing AA
indoctrination sessions (&quot;meetings&quot;). There is a huge opportunity cost involved with
AA membership. You miss out on so much, not just on the time that is wasted
attending the same religious service for the umpteenth time.
<p>
Fear of women is a big
issue for me too. I was taught in AA that &quot;under every skirt is a slip&quot; and that
getting involved with a woman before I had completed the 12 steps would very likely
lead to a relapse and that putting a relationship with a woman before my commitment
to AA would lead to unspecified but dire consequences. The fear that the 12-step way
of life induces creates a very small world within which to live. Overcoming these
fears is not easy and takes time.

<p>
Keep on rocking<br>
Tom<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your sobriety, and your victories.

<p>
I remember the first time that I went into a bar after I had quit drinking. I had several months
of sobriety by then. I was just walking up the street,
and there was a restaurant that had outdoor speakers, and there was an incredibly beautiful song playing, sung in
Spanish by some woman whom I didn't recognize. So I walked in and asked one of the waitresses what that
music was. She was very nice about it, but explained that she would
have to go ask some guy as soon as she could
get a free minute from serving her customers. I waited. All around me, people were eating and drinking
at their tables. And there was the bar, with all of the bottles of liquor lined up in a gigantic display.
I saw it all. I felt a little apprehensive, but didn't do anything except wait. Finally, the waitress came
back and said that it was Lhasa de Sela. I went to the library and checked out a couple of her albums,
and it was worth the wait.

<p>
What I learned from that is that I also won't just flip out if I walk into a bar and see all of the bottles.
I am not powerless over alcohol, either.
I don't make a habit of hanging out in bars, but I won't instantly die if I walk into one.

<p>
About not drinking in the presence of drinkers, I have several favorite lines:

<p>
<ol>
<li> Doctor's orders.
<li> I already drank my quota. (My lifetime quota, years ago.)
<li> I've got other things to do later.
<li> I'm working on improving my health now.
<li> That stuff and me just don't agree any more.
<li> I want to keep my clarity.
</ol>
<p>
The interesting thing is that the times they are a'changin'.
Nowadays, lots of people think you are smart if you don't drink alcohol, not a weirdo.
It seems that the &quot;smart drug&quot; attitude
has kind of worn off on other people.  Lots of people who don't even know what &quot;smart drugs&quot; really are
have still learned the idea that it's smart to not poison your brain with alcohol, which is, after all,
a pretty low-quality drug, when you come right down to it.
<p>
By the way, &quot;smart drugs&quot; aren't really drugs; they are
more like cocktails of vitamins and amino acids and other stuff like that.
I've never gotten into them myself, but I do take lots of vitamins regularly.
They help with the recovery. Especially get lots of B vitamins, which the brain needs for repairing itself
and growing some new brain cells.
<p>
About the socializing, I totally agree. I remember a Baptist preacher who was quite candid,
saying that somebody told him, &quot;Reverend, I find more brotherly love in the bar on Saturday night than
in the church on Sunday morning.&quot;
Yep. And you don't have to deprive yourself of that. Just keep a grip on yourself, which you seem to
be doing quite well.
<p>
Personally, I can't enjoy the bar or pub scene, because when I see people drunk, it's just too painful to
watch. It brings back a lot of old memories, and old feelings that I'd rather not get into.
So I go do other things.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

you will see that the Irish Government Health Service recommends them as
helpful for anyone who is seeking help with depression or emotional
problems. The more I delve into this stuff, the more I am seeing that
sometimes the cure can be worse than the complaint. I know that a lot of
these people mean well, but if the method they use does more harm than good,
their intentions are utterly irrelevant. There might be an oncologist in my
local hospital who is only interested in money and doesn't care much for
humanity, but if his treatment methods work, then his motives don't matter a
damn. He will cure people anyway, even if he is selfish.
<p>
 I also like the bit
on the HSE webpage about depression medication, &quot;They can improve your mood,
help you to sleep and reduce anxiety and agitation. &quot; I could just as easily
say, with equal certainty, that &quot;Listening to Brahms can improve your mood,
help you to sleep and reduce anxiety and agitation.&quot; And I am not aware of
any documented side-effects to listening to Brahms. And I am aware of lots
of documented side-effects to taking anti-depressants.

They have really helped me to learn more and think more clearly about my

important double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials are
when determining whether drugs really work.

<p>
All the best<br>
Tom<br>
Ireland.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Tom,
<p>
Thanks for the input.
I didn't know about that quackery in Ireland. It doesn't surprise me though. The true believers never
rest in their campaign to spread their goofy religious beliefs far and wide.
They have convinced themselves that they are doing people a big favor, even saving the world,
by spreading the practices of Dr. Frank Buchman's cult religion everywhere.
They are of course crazy.

<p>
I have really mixed feelings about the use of tranquilizers.
I am not against tranquilizers or psychiatric medications.  They really do help
some people to get through life, and are a good thing for them. But if somebody is just gobbling
tranquilizers as a simplistic solution to bad feelings, then that's just another addiction. 
Obviously, some people simply substitute tranquilizers for alcohol, and don't change much else in
their lives, and don't get their lives straightened out. That isn't good.
<p>
A confounding factor is that some people cannot be fixed. Some people have such messed up brains
that they cannot survive in the real world without chemical help. In the bad old days, such 
people were confined to mental institutions. Today, they can live free, with the help of medications.
<p>
I'm still quite opposed to doctors just handing out tranquilizers like chicken feed and over-medicating people.
If people can fix what's broken and live without tranquilizers, then I think they are better off.
But some people just can't, you know.

<p>
About the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials:
Guess what kind of test A.A. has failed every time? Every time A.A. was fairly tested in a randomized
controlled study,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">it failed to sober up the alcoholics</a>.

<p>
To be nit-pickingly accurate, it is not possible to do a double-blind test of Alcoholics Anonymous.
A double-blind test requires that neither the patients nor the doctors know whether the patients
are getting the real medicine or a placebo. (Another doctor or pharmacist puts the pills in the
patients' pill bottles, and only he knows who is getting what, and he doesn't tell until the test
is over.)

The patients would have to all be blind and deaf to not know whether they were in an A.A. meeting.
<p>
And the placebo is another question. The best I ever heard of on the subject of placebos
 was the Patty-Cake Treatment Program.
That's about the closest thing that I ever heard of to a placebo-controlled clinical test of A.A.
The way that I heard it, some university professor was noticing just how ineffective A.A.-based
treatment was, so he decided to test it. He divided some alcoholics into two groups. One group got A.A., and
the other group got meetings where they started the meeting by playing Patty-Cake. Then they spent the
rest of the hour talking about sports, news, celebrity gossip, or whatever the heck they wanted to talk about.
The results were that the patty-cake group got the same success rate as the A.A. group.

<p>
A friend commented that he thought the Patty-Cake program would produce real positive effects, because
it offered group identification, socializing, encouragement, and mutual trust. 
The fact that they could get together and trust each other enough to play patty-cake indicated a lot
of openness and trust, he said. He might be right.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day.

Subject:  	AA/NA success rate claims<br>

<p>
Saying 12 step programs have a 90%-100% failure
rate makes me think you have never researched anything regarding your claim with
your own found information. Maybe the lay person will be convinced, but anyone
with ACTUAL knowledge (unlike yourself) will see through your
gimmick.

<p>
As of September 2011, I will be clean 15 years
because of NA. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people I know (far greater than your
claimed 0%-5%),
from NA and AA meetings, in several states, are still clean/sober.

<p>
So, where are you getting this information from? If
you want to make claims, back them up with actual statistics, not implied
statistics. You will look more credible.

<p>
These programs have saved many lives. I only hope that no one reads your farce and
dies because they believed you, and decided not to go to a meeting.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Christopher,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I am not lying or writing a &quot;gimmick&quot;.

<p>
I have done a lot of research on the subject, and backed up my statements with the reports
from real medical doctors who conducted the tests of A.A.-based treatment.

<p>

<ol type="A">
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma</a>
found that A.A. indoctrination greatly
increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics. People who were sent to
A.A. ended up, after 9 months of A.A., doing FIVE TIMES as much binge drinking
as another group of alcoholics who got no such help, and NINE TIMES as much
binge drinking as another group that got Rational Behavior Therapy.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Keith Ditman found</a>
that A.A. involvement increased the rate of re-arrests for drunkenness.
<p>
<li> <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">Dr. Diana Walsh found</a> that
&quot;free&quot; A.A. just messed up a lot of alcoholics and
made them require more expensive hospitalization later.

<p>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
Doctors Orford and Edwards found</a> that just having a doctor talk to alcoholics and their wives for
just one hour, one time ever, telling them to quit drinking or they were going to die, was just as effective as an
entire year of 12-Step-based treatment that included all of the facilities of the hospital.

<p>
<li>
This one is the most damning evidence of all, because it came from a doctor
who loves Alcoholics Anonymous, and is one of its biggest promoters.
He is (or was) also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services, Inc..
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Doctor George E. Vaillant</a>
(who later became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University),
clearly demonstrated that A.A. treatment kills patients. For eight years,
while he tried to prove that A.A. works,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">his A.A.-based treatment
program had a zero-percent success rate above
normal spontaneous remission, and worse, it had the
highest death rate</a> of any kind of alcoholism treatment that he studied.
Dr. Vaillant candidly called the A.A. death rate &quot;appalling&quot;.
At the end of 8 years, the score with his first 100 A.A.-treated patients
was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.
<p>
But 5% per year is the normal rate of spontaneous remission in alcoholics &#8212;
what Dr. Vaillant called &quot;the natural history of alcoholism&quot;.
That's how many alcoholics recover on their own, without any &quot;treatment&quot;
or &quot;support group&quot;. A.A. cannot claim the credit for those
recoveries, no matter whether they attend some A.A. meetings or not,
and Dr. Vaillant clearly said that.  So 5 minus 5 equals zero, the real A.A. recovery rate.

<p>
<li> And then, even though these items have not been surveyed and documented by doctors,
there is plenty of evidence that
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">the A.A. suicide rate</a>
 and
<a href="orange-letters219.html#divorce" target="_blank">the A.A. divorce rate</a> are big problems too.

<p><li>
There have not been as many good, controlled studies of Narcotics Anonymous, but this one comes to mind:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#sponsorship" target="_blank">N.A. sponsorship test</a>.
When researchers tested whether people getting sponsors in Narcotics Anonymous would help to
get them off of drugs, they found that N.A. sponsorship did not help at all. Total failure.
Curiously, those N.A. oldtimers who chose to be sponsors stayed off of drugs more, which shows that
they got some satisfaction out of acting as wise know-it-all mentors. But it didn't help the newcomers any.

</ol>
<p>
When you try to claim that N.A. made you clean and sober, that is an example of the propaganda tricks
of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof by Anecdote</a>
and 
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#testimonials" target="_blank">Testimonials and Stories</a>.
It's just the same as Tom Cruise claiming that Scientology fixed his mind and saved him from the
nasty Evil Galactic Overlord Xenu, while he jumps up and down on the couch, and says that Scientology
knows more about the human mind than all of the psychiatrists in the world.
Do you really believe that Tom Cruise's testimonials prove that Scientology is a wonderful organization
that has all of the answers to mental illness and drug addiction?
That's the problem with testimonials: they don't really prove anything other than the fact that the speaker
really likes his own church or cult or organization.

<p>
You are also <a href="#correlation">Confusing Correlation and Causation</a>. A bunch of people who
are sick and tired of being sick and tired from drugs and alcohol get together and talk, and a few
of them do actually quit their addictions, and stay quit, and then you assume that the cause was the talk meeting and maybe some
old cult religion practices from the nineteen-thirties. Not so.
<p>
The real cause of the recovery is that some people finally wise up and decide not to die that way.
They are not &quot;powerless&quot; over drugs or alcohol or &quot;their addiction&quot;.
They can quit, and eventually, about half of them do.

<p>
Congratulations on your 15 years of clean and sober living. It is good that you used your
own intelligence to decide not to kill yourself with drugs and alcohol, and then you used your will power
and strength to quit and stay quit. The 12-Step quackery had nothing to do with it, and nobody did it for you. 

<p>
Lastly, you asked me for statistics. Okay, I've showed you mine. Now can I see yours?
What is the real Narcotics Anonymous success rate? If we send 1000 drug addicts to N.A., how many of them
will be clean and sober a year later? Two years? Five years? Twenty years?
<p>
I have the numbers for Alcoholics Anonymous

<p>
Have a good day now.

&quot;Hi Orange
<p>
Hope alls well.. I noticed a few letters talk about the sinclair method.. I
know you like research and I highly recommend the book... Its called <i>The Cure For
Alcoholism</i> by Dr Roy Eskapa..  You have to buy it from ebay or amazon and its around
&pound;11 english pounds..  Its a very interesting read and offers real solutions to the
problem of addiction but of course you see the age old question of why haven't we
heard of this before..  Sinclair explains in his book which surprise surprise Money is
the main factor..  This treatment could not only offer hope and save lifes but could
totally transform the recovery industry once the word is out there fully.. I,m trying
to get Drs or perscribers to look at it in my home town.. Take care orange and keep
up the great work dude :D..
<p>
 PS the best thing as well is that its developed by real
science and real medicine and has passed over 70 clinical trials each boasting up to
80% success.. Thats gotta be summert to shout about..
<p>
 Take care Now ....
<p>

Subject:  	A.A. is a cult in decline<br>
<br>
<p>
The sooner the better! We can all do our part by spreading the word about the
horrors of the 12 step cult insanity, I sure do. I am very glad people like you keep
pumping the message out, and no site does it better than yours.

<p>
I still only get to your site every few months just to make sure it's still going
because the day it isn't I will make sure it's mirrored.

<p>
I am alcohol free and I never think about the vile brew at all anymore and haven't
for years, nor do I think about &quot;sobriety&quot; either which is nothing but the even more
destructive addiction to cult practices.

<p>
Looking back, if I had to choose between a slow death by alcohol or the living hell
of life immersed in the 12 steps I would happily choose the path to death through
alcohol than the supposed &quot;life&quot; found in AA.

<p>
Luckily, those aren't our only choices! We must continue to hammer into the numb
skulls out there that they have options! Choose life!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello James,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the compliments. And congratulations on your sobriety
<p>
You make a lot of good points. About the last one: it seems that some people really do decide to die rather
than stay sober by practicing the 12 Steps. Some people are that repulsed by the cult religion.
I think that was one of the things that Charles Bufe noticed in one of his books.
And of course Dr. George Vaillant also documented the fact that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">A.A. actually raised the death rate in his patients</a>.
<p>
Fortunately, as you said, we have a third choice: happy recovery, a life without either A.A. or alcohol.
<p>
So have a good day and a good life now.
<p>
