From:  	&quot;Tony P.&quot;<br>
Subject:  	RE: In response to you blog.<br>

<p>
I have extensively read through your blog- and it appears you have highlighted the
minority of; rather that the majority of: situations that have arisen
I look at the core fundaments not the modified interruptions of the AA program.
If you read the &quot;black parts&quot; of the aa big book I challenge you to find error.
Not the actions of individuals that have a &quot;distorted&quot; interruptions.

<p>
The facts remains that I have first hand evidence of many members of aa with
10-20-30-40 plus years of sobriety.

<p>
AA is an individualist program.

<p>
In addition I see you talk of many of the early shortcomings of aa which were openly
acknowledged by the founding men and women of aa

<p>
That is why the traditions in addition to the steps were added to the aa
philosophical society

<p>
THE A.A. TRADITION

<p>
To those now in its fold, Alcoholics Anonymous has made the difference between
misery and sobriety, and often the difference between life and death. A.A. can, of
course, mean just as much to uncounted alcoholics not yet reached.

<p>
Therefore, no society of men and women ever had a more urgent need for continuous
effectiveness and permanent unity. We alcoholics see that we must work together and
hang together, else most of us will finally die alone.

<p>
The &quot;12 Traditions&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous are, we A.A.'s believe, the best answers
that our experience has yet given to those ever-urgent questions, &quot;How can A.A. best
function?&quot; and, &quot;How can A.A. best stay whole and so survive?&quot;

<p>
On the next page, A.A.'s &quot;12 Traditions&quot; are seen in their so-called &quot;short form,&quot;
the form in general use today. This is a condensed version of the original &quot;long
form&quot; A.A. Traditions as first printed in 1946. Because the &quot;long form&quot; is more
explicit and of possible historic value, it is also reproduced.

<p>
The Twelve Traditions

<p>
One &#8212; Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.<br>
Two &#8212; For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority &#8212; a loving God as He may
express Himself in our group conscience. Our leaders are but trusted servants; they
do not govern.<br>
Three &#8212; The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.<br>
Four &#8212; Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or
A.A. as a whole.<br>
Five &#8212; Each group has but one primary purpose &#8212; to carry its message to the alcoholic
who still suffers.<br>
Six &#8212; An A.A. group ought never endorse, finance or lend the A.A. name to any related
facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and prestige divert
us from our primary purpose.<br>
Seven &#8212; Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside
contributions.<br>
Eight &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional, but our service
centers may employ special workers.<br>
Nine &#8212; A.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or
committees directly responsible to those they serve.<br>
Ten &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the A.A. name ought
never be drawn into public controversy.<br>
Eleven &#8212; Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we
need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio and films.<br>
Twelve &#8212; Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding
us to place principles before personalities.

<p>
The Twelve Traditions
(The Long Form)

<p>
Our A.A. experience has taught us that:
1. &#8212; Each member of Alcoholics Anonymous is but a small part of a great whole. A.A.
must continue to live or most of us will surely die. Hence our common welfare comes
first. But individual welfare follows close afterward.

<p>
2. &#8212; For our group purpose there is but one ultimate authority &#8212; a loving God as He may
express Himself in our group conscience.

<p>
3. &#8212; Our membership ought to include all who suffer from alcoholism. Hence we may
refuse none who wish to recover. Nor ought A.A. membership ever depend upon money or
conformity. Any two or three alcoholics gathered together for sobriety may call
themselves an A.A. group, provided that, as a group, they have no other
affiliation.

<p>
4. &#8212; With respect to its own affairs, each A.A. group should be responsible to no
other authority than its own conscience. But when its plans concern the welfare of
neighboring groups also, those groups ought to be consulted. And no group, regional
committee, or individual should ever take any action that might greatly affect A.A.
as a whole without conferring with the trustees of the General Service Board. On
such issues our common welfare is paramount.

<p>
5. &#8212; Each Alcoholics Anonymous group ought to be a spiritual entity having but one
primary purpose &#8212; that of carrying its message to the alcoholic who still suffers.

<p>
6. &#8212; Problems of money, property, and authority may easily divert us from our primary
spiritual aim. We think, therefore, that any considerable property of genuine use to
A.A. should be separately incorporated and managed, thus dividing the material from
the spiritual. An A.A. group, as such, should never go into business. Secondary aids
to A.A., such as clubs or hospitals which require much property or administration,
ought to be incorporated and so set apart that, if necessary, they can be freely
discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought not to use the A.A. name. Their
management should be the sole responsibility of those people who financially support
them. For clubs, A.A. managers are usually preferred. But hospitals, as well as
other places of recuperation, ought to be well outside A.A. &#8212; and medically
supervised. While an A.A. group may cooperate with anyone, such cooperation ought
never go so far as affiliation or endorsement, actual or implied. An A.A. group can
bind itself to no one.

<p>
7. &#8212; The A.A. groups themselves ought to be fully supported by the voluntary
contributions of their own members
. We think that each group should soon achieve this ideal; that any public
solicitation of funds using the name of Alcoholics Anonymous is highly dangerous,
whether by groups, clubs, hospitals, or other outside agencies; that acceptance of
large gifts from any source, or of contributions carrying any obligation whatever,
is unwise. Then too, we view with much concern those A.A. treasuries which continue,
beyond prudent reserves, to accumulate funds for no stated A.A. purpose. Experience
has often warned us that nothing can so surely destroy our spiritual heritage as
futile disputes over property, money, and authority.

<p>
8. &#8212; Alcoholics Anonymous should remain forever nonprofessional. We define
professionalism as the occupation of counseling alcoholics for fees or hire. But we
may employ alcoholics where they are going to perform those services for which we
might otherwise have to engage nonalcoholics. Such special services may be well
recompensed. But our usual A.A. &quot;12 Step&quot; work is never to be paid for.

<p>
9. &#8212; Each A.A. group needs the least possible organization. Rotating leadership is the
best. The small group may elect its secretary, the large group its rotating
committee, and the groups of a large metropolitan area their central or intergroup
committee, which often employs a full-time secretary. The trustees of the General
Service Board are, in effect, our A.A. General Service Committee. They are the
custodians of our A.A. Tradition and the receivers of voluntary A.A. contributions
by which we maintain our A.A. General Service Office at New York. They are
authorized by the groups to handle our over-all public relations and they guarantee
the integrity of our principal newspaper, the A.A. Grapevine. All such
representatives are to be guided in the spirit of service, for true leaders in A.A.
are but trusted and experienced servants of the whole. They derive no real authority
from their titles; they do not govern. Universal respect is the key to their
usefulness.

<p>
10. &#8212; No A.A. group or member should ever, in such a way as to implicate A.A., express
any opinion on outside controversial issues &#8212; particularly those of politics, alcohol
reform, or sectarian religion. The Alcoholics Anonymous groups oppose no one.
Concerning such matters they can express no views whatever.

<p>
11. &#8212; Our relations with the general public should be characterized by personal
anonymity. We think A.A. ought to avoid sensational advertising. Our names and
pictures as A.A. members ought not be broadcast, filmed, or publicly printed. Our
public relations should be guided by the principle of attraction rather than
promotion. There is never need to praise ourselves. We feel it better to let our
friends recommend us.

<p>
12. &#8212; And finally, we of Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the principle of anonymity
has an immense spiritual significance. It reminds us that we are to place principles
before personalities; that we are actually to practice a genuine humility. This to
the end that our great blessings may never spoil us; that we shall forever live in
thankful contemplation of Him who presides over us all.

<p>
Actually, the fact remains that there is such a thing as normal spontaneous remission.
<p>
Of course you have seen some people with some years of sobriety. So have I, both in and out of A.A.
People quit drinking when they want to quit. When they get sick and tired of being sick and tired, they
quit their bad habits and improve their health and their lives. And A.A. has nothing to do with the
process.
<p>
But A.A. is quick to steal the credit for anybody and everybody who quits drinking after going to
a few A.A. meetings. Even if
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Robertson_already_quit" target="_blank">they quit drinking before
going to A.A., which they often do</a>.  

<p>
Since you believe that A.A. somehow works and makes people quit drinking, please tell us:

No way, Jos&eacute;. A.A. is a make-a-Bill-clone program.
You all go to the same meetings and parrot the same 12 Steps and 12 Traditions, just like you did here.
Then you all read the same <i>Big Book</i>, and quote it as if it were holy wisdom.
Then you recite the same slogans over and over again. See the list of A.A. slogans here:<br>

perform miracles on demand for you.<br>

DARWIN AWARDS WINNER OF THE DAY: 22 December 2013, Portland, Oregon:

<p>
While stealing gasoline by siphoning it from a car, the thief
<!-- Harry Suniville -->
smoked a cigarette. You guessed it &#8212; the sub-genius set the car and himself on fire.
It wasn't very difficult for the police to discern which smoldering figure
was the miscreant, and they hauled him off to jail.
<p>
If you are so hooked on nicotine that you can't even refrain from smoking a cigarette
 while siphoning gasoline, then it's really time for you to quit smoking.  
<p>
Speaking of which, the Multnomah County Jail, where the gas thief went,
is a smoke-free facility. Prisoners are not allowed to smoke in there.
Some inmates consider that a worse punishment than actually being kept in jail.

Oh well, have a Merry Christmas anyway. I will. He won't. So it goes.

RANDOM THOUGHTS, 2013.12.23:
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It's okay for children to believe in Santa Claus. We don't have to
go around disillusioning children and destroying their faith in Santa.
The same does not apply to the 12-Step religion and 12-Step-based
drug and alcohol rehab, however. There, we need to tell the truth,
because people's lives are on the line, and fairy tales don't help them.

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When a believer and a rational person talk about the truth, they are
using the same word but they are talking about very different things.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When a rational person says, &quot;Two plus two equals four. That is the
truth.&quot;, he means that we can clearly demonstrate the truth of that
statement by adding things together. We can group objects together
and see with our own eyes the truth of two plus two adding up to four.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
When a believer says that his beliefs are the truth &#8212; for example,
insisting that everything in the Bible is The Truth, and the
unquestionable Word Of God &#8212; he means something else. He means
that he won't tolerate anyone refuting the validity of his statements
or questioning the truth of those stories. He fervently believes
that if he fervently believes that some things are true, that they
will become true. (And if you don't believe, then you break the spell
and ruin the magic.) Alas, all of those beliefs are false. Simply
believing that something is true will not make it true. Two plus two
will not add up to three or five if you believe it strongly enough,
and &quot;have faith&quot;.


<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;The Progressive viewpoint is not a matter of dominating
the conversation and allowing only one voice or one
opinion; it is a fact-driven conversation where we seek
to establish the truth by examination of all of the facts.&quot;<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  ==  paraphrasing Jefferson Smith, who was talking about the
   soon-to-be-born X-Ray Radio station in Portland, NPR/OPB 2012.12.23, Monday morning.


<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Surprise, surprise! If you shopped at Target and
used your credit card, you are now the target.
<br>
(Which insecure operating system do you imagine Target's computers were running?)


<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Smile!  You are on Candid Camera!  Big Brother is watching you.
The walls have ears, and the NSA ears have big computer farms.
Use encryption and anonymous browsing for everything, all of the
time, even innocent things that you don't mind being public knowledge,
just to annoy the NSA and make their snooping more difficult.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Email huge files of encrypted random numbers to all of
your friends.  It will keep the NSA spies entertained,
trying to decrypt the stuff and figure out what it means.

NEWS NOTE: 2013.12.23:
<p>

I just heard on the morning news that somebody lost $20 million worth of Bitcoins
when some unknown person stole them out of his computer. Ooops!  That's the fatal
flaw in the Bitcoin system.  Since there is no central bank, there is no one agency
that can right the wrong, and get the money back. It's gone. All Bitcoins transactions
are untraceable, by design. And all computers holding Bitcoins are vulnerable to getting robbed.

<p>
And I would bet that the robbed computer was running Micro$uck Windoze. That isn't
a secure operating system. Windoze invites every virus and Internet worm and
Trojan Horse around to come on in and make yourself at home.  Anybody who would
put $20 million in a Windoze computer and then connect it to the Internet needs
his head examined.  That guy is also another candidate for a Darwin Award.

<p>
Oh well, have a Merry Christmas anyway.

At the time, I didn't realize the significance of this. I thought that this was just another goose.
No, it's Mrs. Gus. She is back. She isn't dead. The weasel didn't kill her.
<p>
Previously, I thought that the weasel got Mrs. Gus. (Weasel, or Ermine, or Mink, or whatever they are.)
The Weasel/Mink/Ermine likes to ambush female ducks and geese who are sitting on their nests,
incubating their eggs. He sneaks up on them at night while they are sleeping and jumps on them.
Then he eats both the mother and her eggs. He has killed off all of the female domesticated ducks
at the Fernhill Wetlands.
<p>
In this case, I guess that Mrs. Gus escaped from the weasel, but he still got her eggs. That freaked
her out so much that she flew far away, and stayed away for the rest of the spring, and summer, and
fall. She didn't return until the Winter Solstice. Which is a very strange time to return. You would
think she would be flying south for the winter. But no, she returned to Gus instead.

This little guy is surprisingly tame. He knows the routine. I don't know how he
knows the routine, but he does. He knows that I am putting out rolled oats for
the birds to eat, so he is watching and waiting for me to move away from the pile
of goodies. He isn't flying away in fear when I look at him, or even when I aim
the camera at him. He's just waiting for his opportunity to get the goodies.
Which he did, soon.
<p>
Now this sparrow had already watched while I doled out the oats for Gus and his
mate. He saw that I didn't kill
or eat Gus. He saw that Gus got on the pile of oats and started eating
just as soon as I moved a few feet away from the pile.  If the sparrow

You can see how she has the same shapes of white markings on the sides of her head.
(And the shapes on the left- and right-hand sides are slightly different. The
shape on the right side is a little more bulging, like the shape of the rounded side of
the head of a ball-pein hammer.)
And then of course there is the simple fact that they are hanging out together, and Gus
is very protective of her. Yes, it's Mrs. Gus.
<p>
What a Christmas present for Gus. Now he doesn't have to spend the winter alone.
And his wife isn't dead and gone after all. Merry Christmas, Gus.

&gt; were done  on Tom, including him swearing an oath under penalty of perjury
&gt; if he ever committed the crime of statutory rape, or ever had inappropriate

&gt; girl when Tom was 19. I would like a response from the city about what
&gt; background checks were done on Tom. Tom can reach me at this address. I
&gt; have further questions for him. He has offered no comment on past

&quot; Our book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we know only a little. God
will constantly disclose more to you and to us. Ask Him in your morning meditation
what you can do each day for the man who is still sick. The answers will come, if
your own house is in order. But obviously you cannot transmit something you haven't
got. See to it that your relationship with Him is right, and great events will come
to pass for you and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us.
Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. Admit your faults to Him and to your
fellows. Clear away the wreckage of your past. Give freely of what you find and join
us. We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you
will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny. May God bless

Hello again, Tony,
<p>
I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. Yes, I've also refrained from drinking alcohol, no matter how bad
things got in the last 13 years. Once you really decide to live a different lifestyle, it's a done deal.
<p>
You asked: 
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
No, it is not a matter of just some individuals. That is a standard dodge: Declare that
it's just a few bad apples. No, it's the whole darned thing. Alcoholics Anonymous is a fraud and
a hoax and quack medicine that does not work and has never worked, and Bill Wilson began lying
about the A.A. success rate just as soon as he got A.A. going. Actually, those lies started even
before A.A. started, because the Oxford Group also lied about their great success in sobering up alcoholics.
Bill Wilson just copied the whole racket.

<p>
I notice that you dodged the question about the A.A. cure rate. You just called my response &quot;shallow&quot;
and changed the subject. So come on, what is the A.A. cure rate?
Out of each 1000 newcomers, how many get a 10-year coin for sobriety?
<p>
In your previous letter, you mentioned knowing a few oldtimers with &quot;10-20-30-40 plus years of sobriety.&quot;
You imagine that those people prove that A.A. works. No they don't. The truth is just the opposite.
They prove that A.A. does not work. There are so few of them. If A.A. worked half as well as A.A.
members like to claim, then you should have millions of members with more than 10 years of sobriety.
Instead, you have a few tens of thousands of such oldtimers, who love to stand up
and show off at A.A. conventions doing the &quot;Countdown of Years&quot;.
<p>
And then you (both you and A.A.) have not ever done a proper survey to determine whether those claimed
recoveries were recovery from alcohol addiction or from mental illness or from something else.
And you have never sorted out the socialite hangers-on who merely use A.A. as a social club and
a lifestyle.
<p>
I am reminded of
<a href="orange-letters79.html#Dale" target="_blank">a letter that I received about a youth
who grew up in a &quot;rehab&quot; family</a>
and was in Alateen as a youth. Then, one evening, he drank one bottle of beer. The
next day, he joined A.A. and declared himself an alcoholic and
and picked up his beginner's coin, now he has more than 18 years of &quot;sobriety&quot;.
Eighteen years of &quot;sobriety&quot; after drinking one beer, and that is
&quot;an oldtimer recovering from alcoholism&quot;? Gimme a break. Geez.
<p>
When you count the oldtimers, you make no attempt to exclude and not count such mental cases who
are obviously not real recovery stories.

<p>
Thanks for Bill Wilson' deceptive <i>Big Book</i> statement. Alas, that is just another a bait-and-switch trick.
Bill Wilson said many moderate-sounding things like that to lure the readers in. Later on, they found that the
truth was something else.  Bill started with:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Our book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we know only a little.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition,
William G. Wilson, <i>A Vision For You</i>, page 164.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Perhaps you are not quite in sympathy with the approach we suggest.
By no means do we offer it as the last word on this subject...<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd edition, William G. Wilson,
page 144.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Bill Wilson rationalized his dishonesty this way, and blamed it on the other guys:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Fitz wanted a powerfully religious document; Henry and Jimmy would have none of it.
They wanted a psychological book which would
<font color="blue">lure the reader in</font>; when
he finally arrived among us, there would then be enough time to tip him
off about the spiritual character of our society. &nbsp; ... &nbsp; As umpire of these
disputes, I was obliged to go pretty much down the middle, writing in
spiritual rather than religious or entirely psychological terms.<br>
</font>
<font face="Times" size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>
(1957), William G. Wilson, page 17.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Lure the reader in&quot;? And later on, he will learn the real nature of the organization?
That is called
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">Deceptive Recruiting</a>,
and it is a standard cult characteristic.

<p>
But then that generous, tolerant-sounding attitude morphed into: 
<p>
<a name="death_warrant3">
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Unless each A.A. member follows to the best of his ability our
suggested <font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's required]</font>
Twelve Steps to recovery, he almost certainly signs his
own death warrant.
His drunkenness and dissolution are not penalties
inflicted by people in authority; they result from his personal
disobedience to spiritual principles
<font color="#9F0000">[Bill Wilson's cult religion practices]</font>.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 174.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And the Table of Contents in the same book declares with Orwellian illogic:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Absence of coercion works because unless each AA follows
suggested steps to recovery, he signs his own death warrant.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions</i>,
William G. Wilson, page 12.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And the <i>Big Book</i> also says:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
About half our original fellowship were
of exactly that type [atheists or agnostics].
At first some of us tried to avoid the issue,
hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. But after a
while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual basis
of life &#8212; or else. Perhaps it is going to be that way with you.
But cheer up. Something like half of us thought we were
atheists or agnostics. Our experience shows that you need not
be disconcerted.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">The <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
<i>We Agnostics</i>, page 44.</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
You need not be disconcerted. Coerced religious conversions aren't terribly painful.

<p>
And then Wilson wrote that you must conform to the A.A. program.
So much for A.A. being an individualist program, like you said
in your previous letter.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The AA member has to conform to the principles of recovery. His life
actually depends upon obedience to spiritual principles. If he deviates
too far, the penalty is sure and swift; he sickens and dies. At first
he goes along because he must, but later he discovers a way of life he
really wants to live. Moreover, he finds he cannot keep this priceless
gift unless he gives it away. Neither he nor anybody else can survive
unless he carries the AA message.<br>

Conform and obey, you slave, and then go recruiting and fool the prospects with talk about how
you don't have to conform. <i>&quot;AA is an individualist program.&quot;</i>

<p>
Here is a list of the relevant bait-and-switch tricks that A.A. pulls on the unsuspecting newcomers.
You can click on each item to get the whole story.
<p>
<ul> 
<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#suggested" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that the Twelve Steps are
only <i>suggested</i> as a program of recovery, but then you hear
the slogan &quot;Work The Steps Or Die&quot;.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#shifting_objectives" target="_blank">Shifting objectives:
First the goal is to quit drinking, and then the goal is to
&quot;acquire faith&quot; and &quot;come to believe&quot;
in Bill Wilson's religion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#spirit_rel" target="_blank">First, A.A. is just a nice
neighborhood quit-drinking self-help group, and then it's a
hard-core religion.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_purpose" target="_blank">First, it's only a &quot;spiritual&quot;
alcoholism recovery program, and then it's a fundamentalist religion
whose 'real purpose' is to make you 'serve God'.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#the_only_way" target="_blank">First, Bill Wilson declared that Alcoholics
Anonymous was only one of many ways to achieve sobriety, then he declared
that it was <i>The Only Way</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#real_alcoholic" target="_blank">First, A.A. members insist that Alcoholics
Anonymous does not claim to be the only way, then they
insist that any alcoholic who quits drinking without A.A. was not a <i>real alcoholic</i>.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#your_way" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that you can do it your way.
Then they will tell you that you must do it their way.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what2" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you must follow the formula exactly, or else
it won't work.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#take_what" target="_blank">First, they will tell you that
you can <i>&quot;Take what you want, and leave the rest.&quot;</i>
Then they will tell you that you can't ever leave.</a>

<p><li> <a href="orange-bait-switch.html#death_threats" target="_blank">First, you get declarations of easy-going tolerance, and then,
death threats.</a>

</ul>

<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a happy holiday season now.

**     If alcoholism is really a disease, then A.A. sponsors are
**     guilty of practicing medicine without a license. They are
**     also guilty of treating a life-threatening illness without
**     having any medical education or training.  They have never
**     gone to medical school, and never done an internship or
**     residency, and yet they presume to be qualified to make
**     life-or-death decisions in the patients' treatment. That
**     is what you call quackery.

Hi Orange,

<p>
I've been watching you guys from here in Canada and love everything you are doing.
I did this search tonight and have hit the mother load of sites revealing the plea
bargains that are including aa.  So so many sexual assaults &#8212; particularly with
minors &#8212; where the person is sent to aa.

<p>
Terrible.

<p>
I know you guys are up on how to search but this one works great.

<p>
The other one that works well is 'Petition Alcoholics Anonymous'.

<p>
Happy Reading. :-)

<p>
Ann

Hello Ann,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I'll search those terms as soon as I'm back online.
<ul>
<li> 'Plea Bargain Alcoholics Anonymous'
<li> 'Petition Alcoholics Anonymous'
</ul>

<p>
Have a good day now, and a happy New Year.
