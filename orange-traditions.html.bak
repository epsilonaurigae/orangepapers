<h2><font color="#0000cc">THE TWELVE TRADITIONS OF A.A.,<br>
Interpreted</font></h2>
</center>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Before we even get started, you should know that the so-called
&quot;traditions&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous are not traditions.
Traditions are things that people have been doing for a long time.
Bill Wilson's &quot;Twelve Traditions&quot; are just some new rules that
Bill Wilson made up after his organization had been in existence for a
few years. At first, the other A.A. members didn't like them, didn't want them,
and voted against them. It took Bill years of campaigning to finally
get a committee at a national convention to cast a vote of approval for these things,
and call them &quot;the official traditions&quot;, and then that decision was foisted on
the membership at the convention as if it was already a done deal.
<p>
(Check out this rather scholarly history of the 12 Traditions:<br>

</ul>

<p>
<li>
And <i>&quot;personal recovery depends upon A.A. unity&quot;</i>?<br>
<ul>
<li>
Says who? (Besides Bill Wilson, who wrote these so-called &quot;traditions&quot;...)<br>
<li>
Where is the evidence for that sweeping statement? There is none whatsoever.
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#petitio_principii" target="_blank">assuming facts not in evidence</a>.
<li>
The vast majority of people who successfully recover from alcoholism
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">do it without Alcoholics Anonymous</a>,
so there is no need for Bill's imagined &quot;A.A. unity&quot;.
<li> That is just one more repetition of the standard cultish teachings that
&quot;<font color="#4f007f">Nobody can do it alone</font>&quot;, and
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_cant_without" target="_blank">You Can't Make It
Without The Cult</a>&quot;, which is not true at all.
</ul>

<p>
<li> This &quot;tradition&quot; sounds a lot like a demand for conformity.
<ul>
<li> Don't say things that are &quot;divisive&quot;.
<li> Don't say anything that other members don't want to hear...<br>
<li> Don't start arguments.
<li> Don't criticize <i>The Program</i>.
<li> Don't rock the boat, don't make waves.<br>
<li> <a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_no_truth" target="_blank">Don't contradict Bill's Bull</a>.
<li> Don't upset people by telling the truth.
<li> Just conform to the group. Go along to get along.
</ul>
<p>
<li>
Then this double-talk is ridiculous:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;Hence our common welfare comes first. But individual welfare
follows close afterward.&quot;</i><br>
</font>
That's right down there with the pigs in George Orwell's <i>Animal Farm</i> writing:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot;</i><br>
</font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> What is &quot;the common welfare&quot;, and
how is it different from the welfare of the individual
people who make up the group?<br>
<li> What is there that could be good for the welfare
of one member but bad for the welfare of the group as a whole?

<font color="blue">
<li> The one thing that occurs to me is having one member of the group steal all
of the group's money,
<a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">like Bill Wilson did</a>.
<ul>
<li> It was good for his wallet, but bad for the A.A. group as a whole.
<li> But this tradition talks about what is good for people's welfare,
not what is good for their greed, so that
can't really be what this 'tradition' is about.
<li> Besides, embezzling, cheating, and securities fraud were already illegal,
so A.A. did not need a tradition against them any more than A.A. needs
traditions against rape or murder. (Or 13th-Stepping the pretty girls, right?)
</ul>
</font>
</ul>
<p>
<li> So what is the purpose of this &quot;tradition&quot;? It looks like
nothing more than a demand for conformity and obedience to the group,
backed up by a death threat.

<p>
<li> Both this so-called &quot;tradition&quot; and Tradition Twelve declare
that the group is more important than the lives of the individual members.
Welcome to the cult.

<p>
Like
<a href="orange-letters212.html#Rajiv2" target="_blank">Rajiv said</a>,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook"> 
Till the traditions came, AA was simply there to help those who were afflicted,
or the suffering alcoholics. But this took a back seat in the traditions.
Tradition One says that AA's welfare comes first. So with this tradition the most
important thing, what come first in AA, is to take care of AA and not the suffering
alcoholic. So whenever there is a conflict between the welfare of AA and the
welfare of the suffering alcoholic, it becomes binding on the members to sacrifice
the suffering alcoholic's welfare or the suffering alcoholic. What a shame!<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p><li>
Lastly, this line:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

 &#8212; 
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;If you don't join my cult, you are all gonna die!&quot;</i></font>

There is zero evidence that most of the alcoholics will die without A.A.
The truth is, they do just fine alone.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">The vast majority of alcoholics who successfully quit drinking do it alone</a>,
without A.A. or any &quot;support group&quot; or any &quot;treatment program&quot;.

The
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health,
performed the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related

dependence found in the DSM-IV, they found:<br>

Bill just wanted his new cult to continue.

<p>
The idea that the individual group leaders &quot;are but trusted servants&quot;

<ul>
<li> rulers who answer to no one and who are out of control;

<p>
They do &quot;govern&quot;, and even arbitrarily dictate,

Our membership ought to include all who

<p>
This tradition has good and bad aspects. On the one hand, it is good to let anyone

There is no way to keep out the bad elements like

While this sounds like great freedom, it has the effect of making all groups

newcomers (even mental patients) not to take their medications</a>,
there is no way for the headquarters or other groups to make them stop it.

material and the spiritual. An A.A. group, as such, should never
go into business. Secondary aids to A.A. such as clubs or
hospitals which require much property or administration, ought to
be incorporated and so set apart that, if necessary, they can be
freely discarded by the groups. Hence such facilities ought not to
use the A.A. name. Their management should be the sole
responsibility of those people who financially support them. For
clubs, A.A. managers are usually preferred. But hospitals, as
well as other places of recuperation, ought to be well outside A.
A. &#8212; and medically supervised. While an A.A. group may cooperate
with anyone, such cooperation ought never go so far as affiliation
or endorsement, actual or implied. An A.A. group can bind itself

<p>
The small individual groups may have to live in poverty, but the A.A. headquarters
doesn't believe in it.
They have $6 million in the bank.
They happily took more than $100,000 from the city of San Diego for holding
a convention there.
They have a scam going where they collect royalties on the <i>Big Book</i> from
A.A. organizations all over the world, in spite of the fact that
<a href="orange-bigbook.html#copyright_expired" target="_blank">the copyright on the <i>Big Book</i> is
fraudulent and invalid</a>, and it always has been. And even if the copyright
had once upon a time been valid,
the A.A.W.S. headquarters staff screwed up and neglected to renew the copyright in 1983,
so they really killed any chance that the copyright could be valid,
and they know that.
<p>
Nevertheless, A.A. leaders and their lawyers just recently (2000 to 2003)
went to Mexico and Germany and
<a href="orange-not_good.html#AAWS_perjury" target="_blank">lied and committed perjury</a> to
punish A.A. members for printing their own literature, by declaring that the
<i>first edition</i> of the <i>Big Book</i> was still under copyright.
In Mexico, they even testified in court that the <i>Big Book</i>
had been written just recently by a guy named
&quot;<a href="orange-AAWS-005.gif" target="newwin2">Wyne Parks</a>&quot;
(who was apparently an A.A. office manager in New York),
so the copyright was still in effect. That was a total lie.
<p>
The A.A. headquarters &#8212; the so-called &quot;trusted servants&quot; &#8212;
actually got other A.A. members sentenced to prison for
the crime of &quot;carrying the message&quot; to poor alcoholics.
<p>
Well, the A.A. headquarters sure has allowed &quot;problems of money&quot; to
&quot;divert us from our primary purpose&quot; of spiritual aims, hasn't it?
Obviously, as far as the A.A. headquarters is concerned, their primary purpose is
to make more money, and they won't allow little side issues like spirituality or honesty
to distract them from that primary goal.
<p>
<font color="blue">
In the background, I can hear them whining and crying that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;We had to do those things to protect our profits. Otherwise we
would go broke. That would be the end of Alcoholics Anonymous.
So the end justifies the means.&quot;</font><br>
Actually, the corrupt organization called Alcoholics Anonymous World
Services Incorporated in the Interfaith Building in New York City
 is quite unnecessary. A.A. could survive as a
grass roots organization without that corporation committing crimes.
In fact, &quot;Tradition 9&quot; says that A.A. is not supposed to be organized.

Attend a meeting of any A.A. group as a visitor. When the hat or basket is passed around
to take up the collection, drop in a $10 or $20 bill. See if they tell you to take
your money back because it is an &quot;outside contribution&quot;.

This is another one of those &quot;traditions&quot; that has become
either totally meaningless or completely hypocritical.
There are zillions of A.A. members who make their livings as professional counselors,
working in some detox center or treatment facility, pushing the 12-Step
program on every patient they get. Hence they are getting paid for their
&quot;Twelfth Step work&quot;.

which we maintain our A.A. General Service Office at New York.
They are authorized by the groups to handle our overall public
relations and they guarantee the integrity of our principal
newspaper, the A.A. Grapevine. All such representatives are to be
guided in the spirit of service, for true leaders in A.A. are but
trusted and experienced servants of the whole. They derive no real

This is one of the most absurd of the traditions. Bill Wilson apparently did
not even understand what the word &quot;organized&quot; meant, because he totally organized
Alcoholics Anonymous while proclaiming that it shouldn't be organized.
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Alcoholics Anonymous is legally incorporated into both a profit-making corporation
and a non-profit corporation.
<p>
<font color="#9F0000">
UPDATE 2012: They reincorporated the profit-making corporation as a non-profit, so that they don't have
to pay any taxes. So now it's three non-profit corporations: the publishing house
 Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), The General Service Organization of A.A.,
and The Grapevine (their magazine).
</font>

<li>
A.A. has a national headquarters in New York, and also state councils in every state.
<li>
A.A. has a national council made up of representatives from every state.
<li>
A.A. has a Board of Trustees.
<li>
A.A. has
<a href="orange-letters332.html#AA_finances" target="_blank">executives who are paid anything from $60,000 to $250,000 per year</a>
(and their lawyer Thomas Jasper got $468,000 as a going-away present).

<li>
And A.A. has 6 million dollars in the bank, just a comfortable &quot;prudent reserve&quot;
for a rainy day.

<li> The A.A. national council even has an official committee that examines literature
and decides whether it meets their standards for conforming religious dogma &#8212; whether it can
get the council's stamp of approval &#8212; <i>&quot;Council-Approved Literature&quot;</i>.
<li>
A.A. is organized, completely, totally, organized.

<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">proselytizing and promoting A.A.</a>
in very controversial ways, like having judges
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">sentence people to A.A. meetings</a>.

<li>
The American A.A. leadership has no problem with getting into
controversy by committing felony perjury in foreign courts to make more money, and
<a href="orange-pamphlet2.html#terrorize" target="_blank">to terrorize disobedient foreign
A.A. members</a>
who won't obey the orders of an &quot;official&quot; foreign
&quot;A.A. organization&quot; that is recognized and sanctioned by the
New York headquarters.
<li>
A.A. has no problem with using front groups like the
<a href="orange-cult_a5.html#ca_front_groups" target="_blank">NCADD and ASAM</a> to
promote A.A..
<li>
They have no problem with using a small army of propagandists

<p>
This is the most hypocritical of the traditions.
For many years, Bill Wilson did everything in
his power to promote his Alcoholics Anonymous organization, including
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#early_coercion" target="_blank">him and Dr. Bob practicing
coercive recruiting</a> in hospitals, writing the <i>Big Book</i>,
getting magazine and newspaper writers to
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Hutchison" target="_blank">publish favorable articles about A.A.</a>,
traveling the country on speaking tours,
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">grandstanding and getting his picture
and story printed in the newspapers again and again</a>. By 1944,
Bill Wilson was the most famous &quot;anonymous&quot; person in the USA.
<p>
Then Bill and the other early A.A. members even
got one member, Morgan Ryan, to go on a nation-wide radio show and
praise A.A.
They managed to keep
<a href="orange-letters8.html#Morgan_Ryan" target="_blank">Morgan Ryan</a> sober &#8212; by
locking him up &#8212; just long enough for him to appear on Gabriel Heatter's
<i>&quot;We The People&quot;</i> radio program and tell all of America
how a wonderful new organization
called <i>&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i> had saved him from
alcoholism, and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#ftnt09" target="_blank">then Morgan promptly relapsed afterwards</a>.
<p>
Then Bill Wilson wrote this fake &quot;tradition&quot; and declared that
A.A. was a program of attraction, not promotion. (And everybody but Bill Wilson
had to remain anonymous, and get no fame or publicity or money for saving alcoholics.
Bill got all of that.)
<p>

Today, A.A. uses
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">coercive recruiting</a>
and
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#ca_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">deceptive recruiting</a>
techniques to promote and expand the organization, while proclaiming
that it is only a program of attraction.
<p>
<a href="orange-sentenced.html" target="_blank">Judges and parole officers force great
numbers of people</a>
into &quot;the rooms&quot;, and
the army of paid recruiters (called &quot;counselors&quot; and &quot;therapists&quot;)
who work in the detox facilities and treatment centers route a steady flow
of newcomers into the A.A. and N.A. meetings while pretending that
it is only a program of attraction.
<p>
A.A. regularly runs television commercials on late-night TV, promoting
A.A. while declaring that it is only a program of attraction.
Likewise, the women's auxiliary, Al-Anon, is running radio commercials
while proclaiming the very same tradition.
<p>
A.A. boosters run
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html" target="_blank">a propaganda mill</a>
that cranks out a river of
<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-pseudo2.html" target="_blank">propaganda</a>,

The demand for &quot;principles before personalities&quot;
in Tradition Twelve just means
that their so-called &quot;principles&quot; (really, practices) take precedence over
your personal beliefs, morals, standards, desires, or even your personal welfare.
Again, you must conform to the group. The group is more important than you are.
<p>
And once again,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#exchange_term" target="_blank">the wording is deceptive</a>.
The Twelve Steps are <i>practices</i> &#8212; the
<a href="orange-rroot090.html" target="_blank"><i>cult religion practices</i> of Dr. Frank Buchman</a>
&#8212; not &quot;<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Step12" target="_blank">spiritual principles</a>&quot;.
Dr. Frank Buchman started the deceptive habit of calling his cult recruiting and indoctrination
practices &quot;spiritual principles&quot;, and Bill Wilson just copied him.

There are no &quot;spiritual principles&quot; in the cult practices of Alcoholics
Anonymous. Bill Wilson constantly talked about &quot;principles&quot;, but
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank">he didn't have any</a>.

<p>
To Bill Wilson, &quot;anonymity&quot; meant that
<a href="orange-drydrunk.html#Wilson_drunk" target="_blank">he got all of the publicity, credit,
fame, and glory</a>
(and <a href="orange-aacoa.html" target="_blank">money</a>
and <a href="orange-otherwomen.html" target="_blank">women</a>),
while everybody else had to be faceless, nameless, invisible and
anonymous, and practice
&quot;<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#humility" target="_blank">genuine humility</a>&quot;
and quit being so
