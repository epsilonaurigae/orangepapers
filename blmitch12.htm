<h3>
The Saddest Day In A.A. History</h3>

<h4>
"A fight over literature in Germany has caused controversy within the fellowship
of AA."&nbsp;</h4>
The history of Alcoholics Anonymous is constantly being made. Events that
happen today comprise a page in the overall picture that future generations
of alcoholics who seek A.A.'s help will eventually read. Recent events,
sad to say, are part of the darkest days in A.A.'s future history.

As a student of the history of Alcoholics Anonymous for the past 18 years,
and in almost 23 years of sobriety, this writer is having a difficult time
reconciling what A.A. has stood for in his own personal recovery journey
with recent actions. These actions taken and endorsed by the General Service
structure of Alcoholics Anonymous worldwide have disturbed this writer
to the point of questioning his own continuing membership in this fellowship.
<p>&nbsp;This writer has believed that the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions
stood for a way of life, based upon rigorous honesty and spiritual principles.
However, recent events brought to light have caused personal questioning
of the actual validity and placing into practice of these principles.
<p>&nbsp;A member of Alcoholics Anonymous in Germany, a brother in recovery,
has been attacked by the very organization espousing spiritual principles
- Alcoholics Anonymous. This brother has been vilified and ostracized by
Alcoholics Anonymous to the extent that his membership and personal continued
sobriety could be in jeopardy. All in the name of unity, but in reality,
due to problems relating to money and property.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
The "Crime"</h3>
The individual in Germany and the group he belongs to had translated and
printed A.A.'s basic text into their native tongue. They printed first
164 pages of the original text, now in the public domain due to the lapse
of the copyright. Their purpose was to carry the message of recovery in
accordance with A.A.'s 5th Tradition: "Each Alcoholics Anonymous group
ought to be a spiritual entity having but one primary purpose - that of
carrying its message to the alcoholic who still suffers." (Long Form)

These little blue books were being distributed at no charge to A.A. members
at no charge. They were given away to members as well as in treatment centers,
jails and prisons. Now, due to personally punitive legal measures initiated
by the General Service Office in Germany (AAeV) and Alcoholics Anonymous
World Services, Inc. in New York City (AAWS) this carrying the message
of recovery may have to cease.
<p>&nbsp;The individual in Germany has been taken to court by AAeV and
AAWS not only to stop both him and the A.A. Group he belongs to from printing
and distributing literature in the public domain, but to, in effect, throw
him out of Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>&nbsp;The legal action demands that this A.A. member in Germany no longer
purchase, lend, own or give away ANY literature related to recovery. This
includes all A.A. literature, and literature relating to recovery from
alcoholism by any other publisher. He cannot give a newcomer a Big Book,
go on Twelve Step calls with any literature, or have in his possession
A.A.'s basic text.&nbsp;
<h3>
Third Tradition</h3>
According to the 3rd Tradition (Long Form): "Our membership ought to include
all who suffer from alcoholism. Hence we may refuse none who wish to recover.
Nor ought A.A. membership ever depend upon money or conformity…" By taking
away his ability to carry the message to the still sick and suffering alcoholic,
AAeV in Germany and AAWS in New York have refused to allow the German A.A.
member continued membership in A.A. They have in essence, placed his continued
recovery in jeopardy by his not being able to keep what he has by giving
it away. This is the cornerstone of Alcoholics Anonymous - one drunk helping
another.

This legal action taken by AAeV in Germany and endorsed by the General
Service Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.,
George D., General Service Manager of AAWS and others in the General Service
structure also includes possible incarceration of this A.A. member in Germany
and fines running into the tens of thousands of dollars. A.A. World Services
desires to place this A.A. member in financial ruin as well as kicking
him out of A.A.
<p>&nbsp;AAWS refused to consider recent proposals regarding continued
litigation to be placed on the agenda of the upcoming World Service Conference.
Even the Chair of the Board of Trustees, Gary Glynn (non-alcoholic Trustee)
had been reported to have said that there are times when the Traditions
must be cast aside. At a recent meeting in Germany, Al H., Chairperson
of the General Service Conference of Great Britain stated that he didn't
care if this German A.A. member went to jail or drank again. The German
AAeV wants to take all of the literature owned by this individual A.A.
member and the Group he belongs to and destroy it. This writer wonders
if the German General Service Office remembers in the world's not too distant
past, the practice of book burning once so prevalent in Germany?
<p>&nbsp;In Warranty Five of the Twelfth Concept for World Service it states:
"That no Conference action ever be personally punitive or an incitement
to public controversy." The endorsement by the Board of Trustees, AAWS
and therefore, the Conference of taking an individual A.A. member into
the public courts, threatening his financial future, his freedom (with
possible incarceration), his ability to remain a member of Alcoholics Anonymous
and by causing the A.A. name to be placed in a position of incitement to
public controversy is appalling.
<p>&nbsp;If, as members of Alcoholics Anonymous, we allow a fellow member
to be placed in this position who or what is next?
<p>&nbsp;In many parts of the world, A.A. books sell for as much as $45.00.
In an effort to bring recovery to as many people as possible by giving
away free books, can we allow Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc.
to kick someone out of A.A., place them in financial ruin and give the
message to the public that we don't care? This member's trail begins on
March 26, 1998. This will be the saddest day in A.A. history.
