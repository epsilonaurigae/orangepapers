my

Hello again,

I have been on this
obsession for going on  four years now to &quot;save AA&quot;. I also am beginning to
think my chances are  zero. To start a new organization would be easier,
Maybe called :The REAL way  out. If the six million (my estimate) men and women
we have pushed away, by  the  way our meetings are conducted, could be reached,
and invited back,  maybe this time we could get it right. Eliminate the
hierarchy
sponsor  system, separate from religion, stop the incessant chanting, stop
making a  spectacle of the newcomer, etc, etc, etc.
<p>
You do know  that our chairman of the board of trustees is an Episcopal
Priest  (Non-Alcoholic) dean of some NY seminary. How can we claim to not
be  allied with any sect, when Ward Ewing is our top leader? I still use
&quot;our&quot;
since I continue to attend AA.
<p>
 My next project is to invoke concept  seven
and try to convince our groups to stop sending contributions.  &quot;They&quot;
are currently using vast amounts of the Prudent Reserve Fund to  improve
the AA Grapevine, which 95% of the membership don't even  want.
<p>
About 60% of the groups already use Concept 7,  many without even
realizing it. GSO will find some way of raising the money  to support
themselves. I have tried unsuccessfully to find out what their  salaries
are,
but they total in excess of five million dollars,  annually.
<p>
Yes &quot;OUR&quot; AA Grapevine is in control of the  leadership, and separated
from the membership. I sent in at least fifty  articles and have 17
acceptance
cards and 12 rejections. In four years two  were printed.
<p>
Again, I appreciate your responses, and  hope to be computer updated
in the near future. My daughter was able to  bring up your attachments
and then email them to me. We could be on the same  page, or at least
in the same  book.
<p>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Thanks for the news. And I'm glad that you were able to finally read the pages.
<p>
Yes, I think that A.A. is structured in a way that makes reform impossible. You need
a double majority vote to change anything, and that is as unlikely as getting another amendment to
the Constitution of the United States passed.

<p>
The A.A. leadership cannot be impeached or recalled or defeated in an election, so they
do not have to listen to the membership, and they don't.

<p>
I am reminded of <a href="orange-pamphlet2.html" target="_blank">this pamphlet by A.A. members,
who criticized and censured the leadership</a>. The leadership said that they would consider it and
take it under advisement. In other words, &quot;You critical members can go take a long walk off a short pier.&quot;
Nothing happened.
<p>
And of course Bill Wilson's response to criticism from within the ranks of A.A. was to sneer,
&quot;Those alcoholics sure do like to squabble.&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Your website is important to me...<br>

<p>
I first found it sometime around 2004 after 18 years of battling drugs, alcohol and
12-step programs and rehabs. I've been sober over half the 24 years since my first
meeting (and wtf?! reaction), always with the knowledge that I'd be returned to AA
if I drank or used again. as a powerful negative reinforcer I suppose I should even
credit the cult a bit for my longterm stretches of sobriety.

<p>
what I'm writing you about is the possibility of a schism brewing within the cult:
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103230939/http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1002750--does-religion-belong-at-aa-fight-over-god-splits-toronto-aa-groups" target="_blank">
http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1002750--does-religion-belong-at-aa-fight-over-god-splits-toronto-aa-groups</a>

<p>
I'm a member of a certain We Agnostics group here in Los Angeles and I'd just love
for my group to be thrown out like that.
<p>
On the other hand we do get a lot of people
who need some social support in getting sober and we provide that in a dogma-free
environment even though we're listed in the damn directory. you see, I believe that
AA works (when it does) on the principle of monkey-see-monkey-do. seeing sober
people sharing about a past that sounds like the newcomer's current predicament can
be a useful tool for them to make the decision to stay sober. and that is the only
way anyone ever gets sober &#8212; by making a decision and sticking to it. it's possible
to do alone but I've found it's easier in a social scene. as long as it's not a
dogmatic cult.

<p>
anyway, thanks for all the hard work and thinking you've put into your site. it
really helped me.

Hello Steve,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and thanks for the compliments,
and thanks for your help to the cause.
<p>
Yes, we have been discussing the Toronto story in letters and in the forum too.
So much for Tradition Three:
<center>

The only requirement for A.A. membership is a desire to stop drinking.

<li> <a href="orange-letters243.html#Parrish" target="_blank">
orange-letters243.html#Parrish</a>

</ol>

<p>
I have often thought about the possible positive effects that A.A. could have on people, like
the &quot;monkey-see, monkey-do&quot; effect that you described. 
Unfortunately, it seems that in general, the A.A. teachings
are so bad, so harmful and unrealistic, that A.A. does more harm than good,
just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raising the rate of binge drinking</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">raising the rate of rearrests</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">raising the death rate in alcoholics</a>,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh" target="_blank">increasing the cost of hospitalization</a>
of those who don't die.
Those results just seem to be the inevitable consequences of teaching people that they
are powerless over alcohol,
and worthless sinners, and unable to think for themselves, and unable to resist that first drink, etc.

<p>
On the other hand, if you are teaching your own ideas that are realistic and non-dogmatic,
rather than Bill Wilson's cult religion balony, then you might be able to do some good.
<p>
I wish you luck. Have a good day now.

From:  	&quot;Emma&quot;<br>
Subject:  	Just escaped AA and found your site<br>

<p>
I found your website in an internet search of &quot;AA cult&quot; after 1.5 years of total
immersion in the program followed by, thank goodness, an ability to think for myself
for 5 minutes and start to question &quot;The Program.&quot;  I started going to AA after
rehab not because of any court order or work mandate, but because that is where I
was told to go after rehab &#8212; there were no other program alternatives presented to
me during my rehab stay (which I now realize is against the Traditions, if not
illegal since it is a subsidized rehab.  I never felt like I &quot;fit in&quot; at an AA
meeting &#8212; not once.  I was told to &quot;fake it&quot; and &quot;act as if&quot; and not to &quot;leave
before the miracle&quot; and I was so scared and desperate, I did as I was told.

<p>
I asked a lot of questions about the inconsistencies in the Program and the
literature, and was told I thought too much and that &quot;lots of simple people succeed
in the Program, and lots of smart people are out there dying on the streets.&quot;  This
would usually be followed by &quot;Which do you want to be?&quot;  I have always been
inquisitive, and not one to accept things just because someone tells me too, but
felt that I was being constantly threatened with death.  In retrospect, I can see
now how ridiculous that was, but at the time, it felt all too real!

<p>
I had a sponsor who would freeze me out for two days if I asked too many questions,
and then become angry with me if I dared made a decision about my life without
consulting her first.  Anytime I displeased her, she told me how difficult I was to
work with, and that I was the most frustrating sponsee she had ever had.  In
retrospect, and knowing about her what I do now, I was more emotionally healthy when
I was drinking than she is now.  And they just unleash these people on the newcomers
because they have not had a drink in a few years?  Not much by way of qualification
to act as sponsor if you ask me!

<p>
I was suicidal when I checked into rehab, and I felt a bit better when I left after
three weeks, but as my time in AA dragged on and on, and I was beaten down more and
more through the working of the steps, I began to approach &quot;that place&quot; again.  I
thought of drinking everyday to get the pain to go away &#8212; the pain of knowing what a
terrible person I was and all the terrible things I had done.  And I was working the
crap out of this Program!  I chaired a meeting each week, was an Intergroup
representative for another, and volunteered at the Intergroup office once a week to
answer phones and sell literature.  I went to way too many meetings.  I kept being
told that I was not feeling better because I was not working the Program hard enough
 &#8212; so I worked it harder and harder.  I worked it so hard it became like a second
job.

<p>
Then, I saw the light and fired my sponsor, and without one, I had to make some
decisions for myself, and started to think for myself and started to realize that my
thoughts in doubting the Program were NOT crazy and realizing it is a cult were dead
on.  In reading your website, I have been ashamed many times, though &#8212; still close
to the guilt, I guess.  I said so many of the things that were said to me to
newcomers.  It makes me a little sick to think about.  I was so indoctrinated that
when I thought about leaving, I almost had a panic attack in fear of what God might
take away from me if I did.  How sick is that?

<p>
It has been a month now since my realization.  One AA friend still talks to me, but
we don't talk about this, and she is having a hard time.  I have done a lot of
online research into alternative programs and read a few books.  I am going to
attend my first SMART meeting this Friday.  I am a bit wary of attending &quot;a
meeting,&quot; but am ready to give something new a try, even though I think I could go
it on my own at this point.  The best part is that I don't feel powerless &#8212; I feel
strong and happier than I have in 1.5 years.  I smile more now that I can remember
doing in many years.  I am happy to be free and to have my life back.  And I don't
think of drinking everyday, because I am not beaten down everyday.  I am also not
going to meetings each day listening to people whine about their powerlessness and
how awful their lives are and how they are turning it over to God...

<p>
I do want to say I have gotten some good things out of this past 1.5 years in AA.
It has not been all bad.  But I am really glad that I got out before I drank much
more of the kool-aid.  Thanks for &quot;listening.&quot;  ;)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Emma,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and congratulations on your new freedom and sanity.
I'm so glad to hear that you escaped from the cult with your mind and your life.

<p>
About your nutty sponsor being insane and unqualified for the job: Yes, that is just par for the course.
My 12-Step-oriented &quot;counselor&quot; at the &quot;treatment program&quot;
was a cocaine-snorting Internet child pornographer and child rapist.
How spiritual is that?
The very, very low requirements for somebody to be a drug and alcohol counselor or sponsor is a huge problem
with the whole racket.
<p>
And about your rehab center being subsidized with public money and all that they do is push A.A.:
Yes, that is commonplace too. The same thing happened at my rehab center. They took city, state,
and Federal tax money to run their program, and they sent everybody to &quot;at least 3 meetings per week&quot;,
as if that was the cure.

<p>
<a name="SMART"> </a>
I think you will enjoy SMART. My reaction to it, when I first went, was that it was like a breath
of fresh air. I could actually tell the truth, and ask pointed questions, and nobody had a hissy
fit over me questioning the program. Nobody tried to shut me down and keep me from thinking.
Just the opposite. They teach clear thinking, and how to reject irrational thoughts.

<p>
One thing about SMART: Please don't just go to one meeting and think that you have seen it all.
Different meetings can have very different personalities, just as different as the people who facilitate
the meetings. In my area, there were three different SMART meetings that I went to. One was very staid and
formal, run by a university professor. It was just too rigid for me to feel really comfortable and
relaxed there.
The second was run by college students. They were nice kids, but I couldn't get away from the feeling
that, since I was old enough to be their grandfather, maybe I knew more about addictions than they did.
They were nice, well-meaning kids, but still... I think their actual experience with drugs and alcohol
was close to zero.
The third meeting was run by a young guy, who was a former skate-boarder and rock band guitarist,
who worked as a counselor for troubled children, and it was the loosest,
most free-wheeling meeting of all. One visiting facilitator called it &quot;the wackiest ship in the Navy.&quot;
That was just right for me.
<p>
So please give several different meetings a try before coming to any conclusions. Thanks.
<p>
Oh, and one other thing: I noticed your hesitation to go to another &quot;meeting&quot;. Yes, understandable.
But SMART is really more like going to a high school biology class. You just go and learn what they
have to teach, and then, when you have gotten all that you are going to get out of it, you just
walk out and get on with your life. You don't &quot;join it&quot;, and you don't commit your life to it,
or any such thing. It's just a class, not &quot;a program&quot;.

<p>
Have a good day and a good life now.

Hello Glenn,

Thanks for the letter. You are painting with a very broad brush there. Would you care to get specific
about which statistics you doubt? Try reading the file on
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>.
It is loaded with statistics from doctors who tested A.A. to see whether it really worked
to make alcoholics quit drinking. And they found that A.A. did not work.
<p>
Then we have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">quotes from many A.A. &quot;pioneers&quot;</a>, including Bill Wilson and his secretary Nell Wing,
saying that A.A. didn't work then either.

So which statistics are you disputing?

in trying to explain why someone would spend years telling the truth about A.A.
<p>
The answer is actually very simple: &quot;It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.&quot;
Somebody has to tell the truth to the sick people and improve their chances of recovering.

Have a good day now.

Hi Orange,

<p>

I was a full time member of AA for like 5+ years. Then I just kind of dropped out.
For me it helped, it was a place to go. Also I never really took the mumbo jumbo
that serious in AA (I never take anything too serious)

<p>
When I found Orange Papers online (5+ years ago) I was still in denial about the
harm that AA could do. I sent a post to Orange Papers.
He pointed out that I could have joined any social group and achieved the same
result. It took a while to click in.

<p>
The problem with AA is like all religions it &quot;Lies&quot;, it uses bogus science, and when
that does not work scare tactics.

<p>
About the only good thing about AA meetings is there was one always kicking around.
So if you where bored you could always drop in one.

<p>
Then again you could just make a &quot;social group&quot; without all the lies,mumbo jumbo and
scare tactics and have better results.

<p>
P.S.:<br>
Also despite being diagnosed as an alcoholic 20 years ago. Now that I have my life
straightened out, I can have the occasional glass of wine. I have 2 glasses I stop,
I don't want any more.

<p>
If you keep on telling someone they can't stop, alcoholism runs in the family, if you
don't go to these meeting you will die, etc.

<p>
Guess what will happen ?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello JPJ,
<p>
Thanks for the messages. So true. I'm glad to hear that you are feeling better now, and free,
and in control.
<p>
So have a good life now, and a good day too.

Re: rowland h

Terry, I read your
<a href="orange-letters67.html#Rowland" target="_blank">Letters 67</a>.
 Do you really want to know what Carl Jung contributed
to AA? Well, I believe he gave AA program it's inventory, which is the best
psychoanalysis to get rid of resentment and the anger we tend to hold on to. Of
course it is not explained in the Big Book. I had to counsel and analyze over a
hundred addicts and alcoholics with the inventory before I could understand the
details of the psychoanalysis. But you will not understand it unless you read my
book, where I have explained the psychoanalysis in details. I would love to send you
my book, mainly because I want you to get freedom from the grudges you may be
holding about your childhood issues. So if you could send me a postal address where
I can post the book to you it would be nice.
<p>
Although I'm certain, that Bill got the Rowland's inventory psychoanalysis from
Ebby, I cannot be certain that Rowland got it from Jung. He could have got it from
some other psychoanalyst. This is why I am so keen on knowing all I can about
Rowland Hazard. Because the whole AA movement started with Rowland, not with the
Oxford Group as you think. The Oxford Group ideas only killed it.
<p>
Take care buddy<br>

Hi Rajiv,
<p>
Thanks for the note. That's interesting, but there is no doubt that Bill Wilson got the inventory
thing from Dr. Frank Buchman and his Oxford Group cult religion.

Carl Jung encouraged some introspection in his patients, but the
whole &quot;moral inventory&quot; and confession routine was pure Buchmanism.
<p>
There is increasing evidence that Rowland Hazard went to see Carl Jung around 1926 and 1928. But he
sure didn't learn Buchmanism from Carl Jung.
Both Rowland Hazard and Bill Wilson got it from the Oxford Group, especially from the local New York O.G. leader, Rev. Sam Shoemaker:

<p>

<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Early AA got its ideas of
self-examination, acknowledgement of character defects,
restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from
the Oxford Groups and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their
former leader in America, and nowhere else.&quot;<br>
</font>
William G. Wilson, <i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 39.

<p>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Where did the early AAs find the material for the remaining
ten Steps? Where did we learn about moral inventory, amends for
harm done, turning our wills and lives over to God? Where did we
learn about meditation and prayer and all the rest of it?
The spiritual substance of our remaining ten Steps
came straight from Dr. Bob's and my own earlier
association with the Oxford Groups, as they were then
led in America by that Episcopal rector, Dr. Samuel Shoemaker.<br>
</font>
William G. Wilson, <i>The Language of the Heart</i>, page 298, published posthumously
in 1988.<br>

</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Carl Jung did not teach the kind of self-contempt and self-denunciation and confessions that the
Oxford Group taught. Carl Jung had his faults &#8212;  he was too pro-Nazi for my tastes &#8212; 
but blaming him for spreading Buchmanism is unfair.
<p>
The only thing that Bill Wilson claimed that Carl Jung contributed to A.A. was the statement that
alcoholics must have a &quot;spiritual experience&quot; or else they will die. But Bill Wilson got that
one wrong too. That line came from William James, not Carl Jung:

<p>
<center><table width="75%" border="5" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">
<font color="blue">
Bill Wilson liked to opine that <i>&quot;the only radical remedy ... for
dipsomania is religiomania.&quot;</i> Meaning:
the only cure for alcoholism is religious fanaticism &#8212; religious mania.
And Bill claimed that the saying came from Carl Jung.

<p>
But William James wrote in footnote 1 on page 263
of <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>:<br>
<font color="#9F0000">
'&quot;The only radical remedy I know for dipsomania is religiomania,&quot;
is a saying I have heard quoted from some medical man.'</font>

<p>
William James published <i>Varieties</i> in 1902, but he didn't meet Carl Jung
until 1909, so it is unlikely that James got that line from Jung.
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
I simply cannot find a single thing that Carl Jung contributed to the Alcoholics Anonymous dogma or teachings.
It's all Buchmanism, with one little line taken from William James.

<p>
You can send me your book, and I'll even check it out. I'm curious.
<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
A. Orange,
<p>
Neither of the http://  addresses work for me. My computer is really
obsolete. I
usually say my  computer is old and slow, like its operator.
<p>
 In the July AA
Grapevine
THE  PRISON ISSUE an inmate writes &quot;I was surprised at how much some of the
inmates  knew about AA.&quot;
I spent a couple hours with an  elder who works with the &quot;bottom of the
barrel&quot;
alcoholics and addicts. He  said that most, almost all, of his clients have
come through
the rooms on  their way down to the gutter. AA obviously failed them.
<p>
 I
still attend  AA
meetings. We have a morning meeting 7-8 Monday through Friday. We have
eliminated all chanting, all redundant readings, and the Hold Hands and
Pray  closing.
Our remaining &quot;thorn&quot; is the 24 hour book. We use the 24 hour book and
Daily
reflections book as the topic. I often remind the group that the 24  hour
book is not
AA approved literature. I explain why: It simply has too  much God in it.
The
Daily Reflections book is a conference approved version  of the 24 hour
book,
a little lighter on the God Stuff. By 1990 when Daily  Reflections was
published,
religion already had permeated the fellowship. It  had already evolved into
a
Fellowship.
<p>
The loss of AA's effectiveness is  obvious to everyone except
its
own members. Is it pride, or part of the  alcoholic EGO? AA's numbers from
the General Service Office show our failure.  Their solution will soon be
to
do away with the membership numbers, as  unimportant.
<p>
 Just between you and
me
and anyone who cares to listen, I don't  think enough intelligent members
remain in the
fellowship to turn the  tide and reverse the harmful trends taking place in
AA over the past three  decades. I have had very little success in
convincing many in  AA
that the tide even needs to be turned. We will stumble along,  spinning our
wheels,
failing hundreds of thousands of suffering alcoholics  each year, for
several more decades. The AA Grapevine and General Service  Office will find new
and innovative ways to raise money for their salaries.
<p>
 I  really appreciate
this way of expressing
my concerns. If I talked like this  at an AA meeting, I would likely get
stoned (with
real stones) in the parking  lot.

Hello again, Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the input, and thanks for your genuine concern for the welfare of alcoholics.
<p>
 The big problem that I see there is that A.A. never worked right.
Bill Wilson was just lying when he bragged about the great success rate in the early days of Alcoholics
Anonymous.
We all know about Bill's claim in the Foreword of the 2nd Edition of the <i>Big Book</i> that
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="newwin19">Of alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried</a>,
50% got sober at once and remained that way;
25% sobered up after some relapses, and among the remainder,
those who stayed on with A.A. showed improvement.
Other thousands came to a few A.A. meetings and at first decided
they didn't want the program. But great numbers of these &#8212; about
two out of three &#8212; began to return as time passed.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bill Wilson was simply lying there, just like he was lying when he wrote that

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our
path.
Those who do not recover are those who cannot or will not give
themselves completely to this simple program, usually men and women
who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.
There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have
been born that way.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">A.A. <i>Big Book</i>, 3rd Edition, William G. Wilson,
page 58.</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">There was never a golden age
when the A.A. program worked great to sober up alcoholics</a>.
Even Bill Wilson said so. At the memorial service for Doctor Bob, Bill Wilson bragged about
how hard he and Dr. Bob had to work to get A.A. started. Then, he said:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
You have no conception these days of how much failure we had.
You had to cull over hundreds of these drunks to get a handful to
take the bait.<br>

Dr. Bob, Nov. 15, 1952;
file available <a href="orange-Dr_Bob_Memorial.html">here</a>.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mind you, Bill was not even saying that he got a two percent success rate in sobering up alcoholics
 &#8212;  Bill was just bragging that he
got a tiny percentage of the alcoholics to be suckers and take the bait and join A.A.
Whether they ever got sober was another matter:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At first nearly every alcoholic we approached
began to slip, if indeed he sobered up at all. Others would stay dry six
months or maybe a year and then take a skid. This was always a genuine
catastrophe.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, William G. Wilson, (1957),
page 97.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Has it occurred to you that you might enjoy greater success in helping alcoholics if you try
working with a different kind of group, like maybe
<a href="orange-letters228.html#alt_list" target="_blank">SMART or SOS or Lifering or HAMS</a>, or something?

I read your paper dismissing the effectiveness of AA.  It says rarely have we seen a
person fail that has thoroughly  followed our path.    The people who do not get
sober are those who do not follow the program.  AA is a program that does not ask
for money or membership dues.  We are people helping people get better from our
hearts.  Who are you to try and rip it apart.  Have you ever had an addiction in
your life or you just revel in tearing good things down.  How do you explain the
millions of people who have gotten sober through AA?

Hello Ryan,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
What you are describing there is just a word game,
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#qualifiers" target="_blank">Lying With Qualifiers</a>.
That propaganda trick works like this:
<p>
<ol>
<li> People who <i><b>Thorougly Follow Our Path</b></i> always quit drinking.
<li> One of the big requirements of our path is that people must quit drinking in
order to <i><b>Thorougly Follow Our Path</b></i>.
<li> Therefore, 100% of the people who do <i><b>Thorougly Follow Our Path</b></i> do quit drinking.
</ol>

<p>
That is just a bunch of nonsense, and circular reasoning.

<p>
I can do the same thing with the Ballerina's Tutu Cure (which is: Whenever you want a drink, just dress up
in a ballerina's tutu and dance around until the urge passes):
<p>
<ol>
<li> People who <i><b>Dance In A Tutu Properly</b></i> always quit drinking.
<li> One of the big requirements of The Ballerina Tutu Cure is that people must quit drinking in order to <i><b>Dance In A Tutu Properly</b></i>.
<li> Therefore, 100% of the people who do <i><b>Dance In A Tutu Properly</b></i> do quit drinking.
<li> RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our Ballerina Tutu path.
</ol>

<p>
Yes, I have had terrible problems with addictions. You can read about my history and recovery here:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a>

<p>
Lastly, A.A. has not saved millions or sobered up millions. That is just the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#big_lie" target="_blank"><i>Big Lie</i></a> of Alcoholics
Anonymous &#8212;  another standard propaganda trick. They routinely claim to have saved
millions when they haven't.
The truth is that A.A. does not work at all. It just steals the credit from a few people who were going
to quit drinking anyway.

<p>
Hi Terry.  I notice that you've been quite active lately answering letters.  I
get a smile on my face every time I see a new page full of letters is up.  Have
you been receiving less hate mail recently, or is it my imagination?

<p>
Anyway, I always crack up when I read the letters you get from people who claim
that you can't possibly know what you're talking about because you &quot;don't
understand&quot; the program, never really drank the kool-aid.

<p>
I have the opposite problem!  It's like you can't win with these people!  I've
been sober for nearly thirteen years and I did drink the kool-aid... at first.  I
was an AA true believer for several years before waking up to the reality that
I'd unwittingly joined a cult.  I did not need to read your website in order to
figure this out: the program itself provided all the evidence I needed.  I'm
still a little stunned that it took so many years for me to see it, though: I
watched the revolving door, the relapsing, the suicides, the destroyed &quot;outside&quot;
relationships, the sponsor-sponsee abuse, the 13th stepping, the preaching
against psychiatric medications, for an embarrassingly long time before I
finally realized what I was involved in.

<p>
Once I did, though, I couldn't stand another minute of it.  I quit immediately
and began the process of deprogramming, with which your site has been enormously
helpful.  Deprogramming was painful (frankly, considerably more painful than
quitting drinking was), and left me a fairly vocal critic of AA and its hegemony
over the US treatment industry.

<p>
When debating with steppers, I'm often amazed at how redundant their statements
are and how little most of them know about AA history.  It is fairly easy to
hand their asses to them.  But what really freaks them out is the fact that I'm
not just a critic: I'm an apostate, who &quot;got sober in AA&quot; and how has the
audacity to criticize the program that &quot;saved my life&quot;!  How convenient for
them.... you're slammed for criticizing what you &quot;don't understand&quot; and I'm
scolded for repeating what I personally experienced!

<p>
Tell you what:  let's keep right on talking.  Because we are making a
difference, all of us who speak the truth.  Thanks for all you do!!!

Thank you for the letter. I like to hear from people who have really been in A.A. for a while,

About the hate mail: It seems to come and go in waves, like the waves washing ashore at the beach.
Some big ones, some little ones, some big ones, some little ones.  ...The ebb and flow of it.
I just got another wave of negative, critical, letters immediately before yours came in. So it goes.
<p>
And yes, let's us continue to tell the truth. We must continue to

In the past, was thrown out of f2f 12 stepper groups and quit or was thrown off
12 stepper online user groups, however since I first came to AA in 1976 when it
was 'the only game in town' (and is in many suburban and rural areas in US), one
pity pot, Mary from Michigan kept sending me lies about Bill wilson stating he
would never let Communists and Hippies (like myself) participate in AA and I
needed Baptism and the Lord. Now I stay away from 12 step flakes and loons.
<p>
17 years, no meetings, no Spansaw, no BB no desire to drink or use, miss a few
old pals in AA, some of were sarcastic, sat in the back in 'inventory row'
otherwise would have gone nuts

<p>
<font color="blue">
@Donald: Wow. She actually claimed that Bill Wilson said that he wouldn't let
Communists and Hippies in A.A.? Wild. That is a new one on me. I'd love to get a
verifiable quote. (But of course it is possible that he never said that, and she
was just blowing hot air.) Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange,

<p>

&quot;It was somehing some &quot;Christians' in AA had made up. I remember commenting that
sometimes hippies in the late 60s would visit Bill at the 23rd AA Club in NYC and
Bill told them 'the Woodstock Generation would someday come into AAs.  I was one of
them, came in in 1976. This Mary belonged to an organization run by a Dick B. then
Christian Roots of AA, after I had enough missives from these people I used foul
language and was asked to leave the 12 Step group, forthwith.

Understanding God

<p>
Shoemaker said you could understand and know God by following Jesus Christ's
suggestion in John 7:17, by conducting an &quot;experiment of faith.&quot; Once AAs abandoned
the Bible, the discussions of the Creator, and their reliance on coming to God
through His Son, they began to lose understanding of God. They began talking of a
higher power which could be a group, a lightbulb, a door knob, a chair, and nonsense
which could not be found in early A.A. nor in the literature early AAs read.

<p>
Wilson was an occultist with few 'morals' I believe.

<p>
My higher powers lives with me and I need to utilize it several times a day, my DOOR
KNOB!!! I should get it gold plated one day!!!!

<p>
lol, still abstinent, still clean and no regular meeting attendence in 17 years, so
I am sane!!!!!!!&quot;

<p>
 Most of it is a scam to make money, my last 'relapse' almost 17 years ago,
 Detoxed myself, no desire to drink and had my true 'spiritual awakening',
 stop going to AA meetings and get a life!!!!!! lol.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, congratulations, and have a good day too.
</font>
<p>
Any day without an AA 'meetin and 'spansaw' and listening to brinwashed flakes
quoting the Big Book is a good day!!!!!

<p>
For me it is SIMPLE, have been told by mental health professionals that
I have a brain chemistry that can tolerate no alcohol, not even one
'social drink' so I am abstinent, I am not 'moral leper riddled with
 defects of character' so no meetings, no big books, no Steps, just my
old door knob that was once my temporary 'higher power; lol
<p>
Why can't there be a common sense secular fellowship for all??? I would ENJOY going to those types of gatherings.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. I have the same problem with not being able to tolerate one drink. Nevertheless, I can stay sober for
10 years (and still counting) without too much trouble, just as long as I don't take that first drink.

<p>
There are several other sane, sensible, realistic groups for sobriety.  You might try
<a href="orange-letters228.html#alt_list" target="_blank">SMART or SOS or Lifering</a>
or something like that. I did enjoy the SMART meetings.

<p>
Have another good day now.

Terry,

<p>
I will try and sign up again for your new Forum. In the meantime I am finding my enthusiasm for
making films again &#8212; here is my latest one. It is long at 15 minutes but
well worth it I think. I would be most grateful if you would be so kind as
to link it. If you would like the Orange Papers to be added at the end just
let me know.

<p>
I hope this finds you well.

Production Notes for &quot;Childhood and Addiction (Why Love Matters)&quot; &#8212; 

<p>
I have made countless films on the subject of addiction but this one is one
of the more important. I have long been outspoken against the powerless
model of recovery for the simple reason that I believe in the empowerment of
the individual. In this production I draw on the ideas presented by the film
Zeitgeist Moving Forward as well as borrowing from Harlow's somewhat
controversial experiments on monkeys regarding our need for touch. I was so
moved by Gerhardt's book (Why Love Matters) that I had to express what it
meant to me via a medium I am well versed in, namely film. Whether I agree
with everything put to us in the film is another question. That said I place
a tremendous importance on keeping an open mind when it comes to treating
addiction especially when the most used model only has a 5% success rate,
the same as spontaneous remission, or doing nothing.

Hi again, James,
<p>
Yes, I am well, and I trust that you are too.
I'm glad to hear that you are making videos again. I'll check it out.
<p>
I've been watching for your registration on the forum, and haven't seen it yet. Unfortunately,
the system has no way to look up registrations by email address. It only shows the user name,
and only allows sorts and searches by user name.
So if I don't recognize the user name, then I may overlook it.

<p>
Have a good day now.

<p>
Dear &quot;Orange&quot;
<p>
While Googling some information regarding a statement by Bill Wilson, I stumbled
across your site (again, not the first time). I am quite amazed at how much anti-AA
information you have accumulated, and even more amazed at the amount of time and
effort must have went into such a collection.  I couldn't help but wonder, &quot;Why is
this person so mad at AA?&quot;.
<p>
I tried to find something on your site, but there is just so much there, and I don't
want to spend my whole day on this curiosity, so I appeal to you. Again,&quot;Why so mad
at AA?&quot;.  What could have AA as a whole have done to make you so upset?
<p>
Just so you know, I have been attending AA for quite a while, but it's never been a
panacea for my drinking problem, and I have some pretty serious issues with
mainstream AA dogma too, so I guess we're kindred spirits, yet I still attend
meetings.  My spiritual leanings are Buddhist by nature, but I hesitate to call
myself a Buddhist and perhaps there lies my problem. Maybe not.
<p>
But my question remains,  &quot;Why is this person so mad at AA?&quot;.
<p>
Help me out here, you may be useful to help me find some help with my issues with AA.
<p>
Thanks.

I am reading some recent e-mails you have posted.  Quite interesting.  Perhaps we
ARE kindred spirits, and there seem to be plenty of us!

Hello Vernon,
<p>
Thanks for the letters and the questions. I hope that we are kindred spirits.
<p>
There is a simple answer to the &quot;why?&quot; question: Back in the year 2000, I went through something
that was called &quot;outpatient treatment of alcoholism&quot;, which turned out to be total fraud, just
some con artists selling Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous as a cure for drug and
alcohol problems.
I was shocked to discover that cult religion and quack medicine were the usual treatment for
addiction problems.
<p>
I started writing what I thought would be like a 30-page term paper, explaining
why I felt that it was wrong to use the 12-Step nonsense as a &quot;treatment program&quot;
for addictions. One thing led to another, and I ended up with a web site.
That whole history is described here:

<p>
I also like Buddhism, and also hesitate to call myself a Buddhist. I don't feel quite qualified for the role.
When I think of Buddhism, I think about the TV program <i>Kung-Fu</i>, and
the old master saying, &quot;Little Grasshopper, you must quiet your mind and have one-pointed awareness.&quot;
Then Kane catches an arrow in flight.

<p>
Eee, yeh. Not yet.

<p>
Have a good day now.
