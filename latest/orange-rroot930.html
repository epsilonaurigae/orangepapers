<a name="Garth_Lean"> </a>
If you want a laugh, or want to barf, depending on your
inner constitution, try this book:
<i>On the Tail of a Comet, The Life of Frank Buchman</i>, by
Garth Lean. This book is a total
whitewash, and a complete glorification of Buchman. Rarely will
you find such a piece of total garbage, 590 pages of it.
<p>
<a name="ftnt068_ret"> </a>
<a name="ftnt069_ret"> </a>
Garth Lean was a long-time member and true believer in the cult.
Peter Howard mentions in <i>Innocent Men</i> (1941) that Garth Lean was
instrumental in his conversion, and Geoffrey Williamson reported in his
book <i>Inside Buchmanism</i> (1955) that fourteen years later,
Garth Lean was still there, still selling Buchmanism to the
newcomers.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt068">68</a></sup></font>
By then Garth Lean was
a member of the Council of Management of Moral
Re-Armament.<font size="-1"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt069">69</a></sup></font>
<p>
The back cover of Lean's book reads in part,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;This is also the story of a controversial
Christian statesman who was once denounced as a secret Nazi agent
subsidized by Goebbels,
while being suspected of operating a super-spy network for
British intelligence.&quot;<br>
</font>
Question: Who, besides the author, and perhaps the book's
hopeful publisher, ever suspected that Frank Buchman was really James Bond?
<p>
Then it gets worse inside the covers. If you were to believe half of
the stuff in this book, you would have Frank cruising the world, talking
to nothing but heads of state, and miraculously solving all of their problems.
<p>
For instance, according to this book, Frank Buchman
single-handedly solved the perplexing
massive unemployment problem that cursed Denmark in 1939, by
asking people whether it was
God's will for a fifth of the work force to be unemployed. <br>

&quot;No,&quot; was the answer.<br>

&quot;Then go home and tackle it,&quot; Frank said.
Allegedly, the result was a national
campaign, and overnight, new jobs were
created and the whole country went back to work.
The Danish people had all just been waiting for Frank Buchman
to come and tell them what to do... (Pages 267-8.)<br>

(Unfortunately, it was really Adolf Hitler who solved Denmark's unemployment
problem, by invading the country and turning everybody into slave laborers...)
<p>

The photographs in the book show Buchman with a long list of
royalty, heads of state, and other
high-ranking officials. But someone forgot to include any good
photographs of Hitler, Himmler,
or Goebbels. The author rewrote the history before World War
II, so that rather than praising
Hitler, Buchman warns the USA and Britain of the coming dangers
in the chapters, &quot;Awakening Democracy&quot; and &quot;America
Has No Sense of Danger.&quot;
The Buchmanites explained Buchman's failure to convert
Adolf Hitler into a nice guy by stating that Buchman
never met Hitler; that the other Nazis, knowing how
effective Buchman was at making saints out of sinners,
blocked Buchman's attempts to see Hitler. The true believers
didn't offer any explanations for the failure of Buchman to
&quot;change&quot; Himmler or Goebbels.
<p>
Speaking of World War II, Garth Lean gave us a very distorted version of the flap over
the MRA draft-dodgers. He talked about the lively debates in the Parliament,
and told us that 174 members opposed drafting the Groupers,
and then implied that just one British official &#8212; Minister of Labor
Ernest Bevin &#8212; went off half-cocked and
acted unreasonably in declaring that Oxford Group and MRA members
would be drafted anyway. Garth Lean completely forgot to mention the
minor detail that, after the lively debate, a majority of
the House of Commons <a href="orange-rroot420.html#Nazi_like">voted to deny</a> the
Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament members
exemptions from the draft. (Pages 298 to 303.)<br>
<i>That's the propaganda technique called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#lie_omission">Lying by Omission</a>&quot;.</i>

<p>
And Buchman and his group weren't kicked out of Princeton in
1923, this author says.
Princeton President Hibben publicly stated that, in December
1923, he had banned Dr. Frank Buchman from the Princeton
campus, but Buchman and his friends insist that
they were not aware of this, and
remember only that Hibben had expressed &quot;great confidence in
Sam [Shoemaker] and the young
men working with him&quot;, 'whom he knew to be products of
Buchman's work.'
<p>
<a name="practicing_homosexuals"> </a>
Then, some very strange logic follows: Enemies of Buchman
at Princeton, whom the book
hints were &quot;practicing homosexuals&quot;, allegedly prepared
a pamphlet called &quot;The Cannonball&quot; and
showed proofs of it to President Hibben, and threatened to
publish it unless the President
denounced Buchman. This book does not say what the pamphlet
contained, or why the President
should care if it were published, or how the President of
Princeton could be blackmailed by the
anti-Buchmanite forces. Nevertheless, the story says, Hibben
responded by getting an
understanding from Sam Shoemaker that Buchman would not be
invited back to Princeton.
<p>
Buchman says that he had merely received a Guidance from
God, in the spring of 1924, that
he should &quot;Clear out of Princeton completely.&quot; (Pages
103-5.) It seems that, even if Buchman
could not understand that he had been banished from Princeton,
God could understand it.
<p>
In 1958, Buchman and gang visited Japan, where they say they found
that the Japanese cabinet was
'terribly corrupt', taking bribes and keeping mistresses.  So
one of the local Buchmanites, in
three days, wrote a play exposing this evil, and they publicly
performed it. When the Prime
Minister allegedly found out about it, and investigated, and
found it all to be true, he supposedly
said to the Buchmanites: &quot;You are the only people who love
our country enough to tell me the
truth. Go on talking to me like this. The door is always open
to you.&quot; (Pages 508-9.) If you
can believe that any politician would be delighted to have the
misconduct of his cabinet so
publicly, scandalously, exposed, and if you can believe that any
Japanese Prime Minister would
welcome such a public, humiliating, loss of face, then I own a
major interest in a big bridge in
Brooklyn that I'll sell to you cheap... At times, this book is
so stupid that it insults the reader's
intelligence.
<p>
<a name="Leans_footnotes"> </a>
If you are interested in any scholarly research, you will
find Garth Lean's book to be maddening,
because very little of anything can be verified.
Most of the footnotes read
like, &quot;Buchman to unknown Yale
student, 19 August 1920.&quot; (Question: if Buchman is dead,
and the student is unknown, and
probably dead too, how does anyone even know that such a
conversation ever took place? What
is the real source of the information?) Another great footnote:
&quot;Buchman to mother, 19 March 1924.&quot;
And: &quot;Lady Hardinge in talks with author and others.&quot;
And, naturally, it is the most questionable
and controversial points that have the flimsiest of supporting footnotes.
<p>
There are a few items of interest buried in there, however,
like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<i>What is Moral Re-Armament?</i><br>
It's not an institution,<br>
It's not a point of view,<br>
It starts a revolution<br>
By starting one in you!<br>
<p>
</font></blockquote>
I could swear I heard something like that in an A.A.
meeting.
<p>
Speaking of which, it is very interesting to see the roots of A.A. and N.A. in
Buchmanism. For instance, on
pages 150 and 151, we read about a fellow named Jim Driberg who
had a drinking problem, and
The Oxford Group had dried him out. But there was something
about the Oxford Group that put
him off, so he wrote a letter explaining that he could no longer
work with the group. The
Buchmanites' conclusion: &quot;His elder brother John attributed
the sudden move to the mental factor
which has now and then sent Jim off on absurd tangents.&quot; In
other words, he's crazy.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Alas, Jim Driberg could not make it alone.
As Tom, his brother, relates in <i>Ruling Passions</i>, he soon
turned back to the bottle and to massive borrowing.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
You are crazy if you quit the group and stop practicing Buchmanism, and
you will never make it alone &#8212; you can't maintain sobriety without a
'support group'. The seeds of A.A. are all there.
<p>
Yes, all there, even the failure rate and the nasty habit of
repeated relapses. Another
famous drunk whom the Oxford Group supposedly dried out was
Russell Firestone, the prodigal
son of the famous tire manufacturer Harvey Firestone.
The father was so grateful that he sponsored Dr. Buchman
and team of 60 in Akron, Ohio, for a ten-day campaign, which
established an ongoing
functioning group in Akron, which ended up being the famous group
that Doctor Robert Smith of A.A. fame
joined. But, much to the embarrassment of the Oxford Group,
after they had publicized the newfound sobriety of
Russell Firestone for all it was worth &#8212; the
family doctor had called it a &quot;medical
miracle&quot; &#8212; and after the Oxford Group had staked
some of their reputation on it,
Russell relapsed repeatedly, publicly,
spectacularly, in all of the wrong high-society places.
(Sort of like the movie <i>Arthur</i>.) Ah, but this book
doesn't mention that last part...
<p>
Speaking of A.A., it gets only a tiny mention. Literally, two
and a half pages, 151 to 153.
Bill Wilson, Doctor Bob, and the anonymous alcoholics group are all
dismissed with a cavalier wave
of the hand, and an attitude of, &quot;Oh, yeh. That's also
another one of the many great things that
we did, but we've done much better than that.&quot; Bill and Bob
got their original charter in the
Oxford Group with the words, &quot;You look after drunken men.
We'll try to look after a drunken
world.&quot; That was just a little condescending: &quot;You
play with some drunks while we save the
world.&quot; Still, the Buchmanites claim A.A. and all of its
clones as just some more of the many
organizations that have benefited from Frank Buchman's
'brilliant morality'.
<p>
<a name="Paul_Campbell_1"> </a>
If your A.A. sponsor wants your ego deflated, check this: This
book describes how Frank Buchman
would regularly attack the people around him, finding faults in them,
and constantly deflating their egos
whenever they felt any self-confidence or pride in their work.
Then they would confess that they
had needed such guidance, because they had been slipping into
self-seeking. Why, it's just a
regular good old sado-masochistic lovefest:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One day there was something wrong with Buchman's
stomach. [Dr.] Campbell gave him his diagnosis.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;You don't know anything about stomachs, do
you?&quot; asked Buchman. Campbell, who had studied
stomachs in one of the best hospitals in America, was
outraged.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Two days later, Buchman said, &quot;I don't think we'll
call you 'doctor' any more.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Just single sentences, but what sentences for a
proud young doctor,&quot; says Campbell. He was deeply
hurt. He seemed suddenly to be able to do nothing
right in Buchman's eyes. He said to Barrett,
&quot;Doctors are meant to be helpful. I seem to be making Frank
worse. I think I'd better go home.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;What do you want from him?&quot; asked Barrett.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;To be appreciated from time to time. Not always
under criticism. To be able to tell my family I am doing
something worthwhile.&quot;<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Would going back to Canada cure that lust for
appreciation?&quot; asked Barrett.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Campbell saw the point and decided that he would
do whatever God wanted, however he was treated by
Buchman or anyone else.<br>

Frank Buchman reduced his personal physician and true believer,
<a href="orange-rroot930.html#Paul_Campbell_1">Dr. Paul Campbell</a> (center, in white coat),
to selling copies of the book &quot;You Can Defend America&quot; at shows.<br>
(Photo taken in Atlanta, Georgia, April 12 to 20, 1942, probably by Arthur Strong).<br>
Also selling books were Edith Shillington (Ramsay) and Edward
Bell, formerly headmaster of England's St. Bees Public School.<br>

<font color="blue">
<i>So a real fully-qualified medical doctor was reduced to selling books at shows, just like any
other Moonie or Hari Krishna cult member, instead of practicing medicine?</i><br>
The school-master didn't fare any better, either.<br>
That just seems to be one of the characteristics
of cults: They don't build up their followers, they tear them down
until they are reduced to grovelling wimps who will do whatever they are told.
<p>
It seems that, after Frank Buchman got his claws into Dr. Paul Campbell, Campbell never practiced
medicine again.
Campbell wasted the rest of his life
<a href="orange-rroot990.html#Paul_Campbell_book">promoting Frank Buchman's cult and writing Buchmanite propaganda</a>.

<font color="#9F0000">

wounded soldiers, if he really wanted to be helpful and defend America?

<p>
In fact, Frank Buchman seems to have written a new book,
<i>&quot;How To Win Friends and
Influence People By Putting Them Down&quot;</i>:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Buchman held a meeting each morning. They
were wholly unpredictable. One day he arrived with a
peach in one hand. &quot;Every woman should be like this,&quot;
he said. &quot;But some of you are like this,&quot; and he opened
his other hand to disclose a prune. He felt that some of
the women in his team had become dry in spirit
because they had not given God unconditional control
of their lives, and were therefore not free personalities.
&quot;It meant fearlessly tackling some of us dominating
American women,&quot; one of them said later. &quot;But
it was done so delicately, with such hope.&quot;

in the eye when he pulled a stunt like that, and say,
&quot;Go to Hell, you stupid ass-hole.&quot;

Also, notice the Orwellian double-think in the above quote:<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>&quot;they had not given God unconditional control of their lives,

And, by implication, &quot;Slavery is Freedom!&quot;

<p>
<a name="Tod_Sloan"> </a>
<br>
I mentioned earlier how Frank Buchman considered any do-good
social movements (other than his own) to be immoral. We have another
example here, describing the conversion of Tod Sloan, a well-known
East London labor movement militant:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
He went in to the meeting and, as he later said, &quot;got a
basinful.&quot; He came to realize that his agitations on
behalf of the unemployed and homeless, his fights for
meals and boots for the school-children, essential
activities which had sometimes landed him in jail, had
inadvertently taken a wrong turning. &quot;I'd always
said that I loved my class and family... But I saw that the
main thing I'd done was to teach them to hate. I'd said I
was an idealist, but I'd made materialists out of them,&quot;
he said.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">(Page 263.)</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Campaigning for school-children to have meals and boots is
wrong, because it makes
&quot;materialists&quot; out of them? Those Buchmanite guys were
really something else. I can see his
point about it being wrong to teach people to hate &#8212; don't do
that &#8212; but abandoning the unemployed, the homeless, and the
school-children because we don't want to make materialists out of
them?<br>
<i>That is literally throwing the baby out with the bath water.</i><br>
Once again, Ebineezer Scrooge
would be pleased. This gets to sounding so much like something
out of a Charles Dickens novel that it is uncanny.

<p><br>
Many people hated the Buchmanites, and strongly criticized
them for all of their faults.
This book minimizes such controversy, but does not ignore it
totally. They have a very interesting
explanation for the criticism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Malcolm Muggeridge writes that for a long time he
was puzzled by &quot;the extraordinary hostility which
Buchman's Christian evangelism caused&quot; in Britain.
&quot;Yes, he's an American,&quot; he says, &quot;but so
is Billy
Graham, for instance, and I've never heard people
denigrating Billy in quite such vicious terms as they did
Buchman and MRA.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;An experience I had some years ago shed light
on the conundrum. I had been elected by the students
of Edinburgh University to be their Rector, and when I
went to Edinburgh to be installed I had a wonderful
reception. Then some months later I was asked by the
Students' Union to put in a request to the governing
body of the University that contraceptives should be
made freely available by the University Medical Unit. I
refused to do this, whereupon I was subjected to abuse,
to the point that I found it necessary to resign. In a
farewell sermon in St. Giles' Cathedral, I explained why I
had done what I had, and received some private thanks,
but none publicly. The conclusion I came to was that in
a libertine society any attack on libertinism is
anathema...&quot;<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
(Pages 270-271.)</font><br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oh? Really, Malcolm? You were so thoroughly hated that you
were forced to resign, just
because you would not give out free contraceptives? Why am I
having trouble believing that?
<p>
And, by implication, Frank Buchman and MRA were likewise viciously hated
just because they wouldn't approve of people's immoral activities?
So the people who disliked Buchman were all just a bunch of libertine
sinners?
<ul>
<li>
The Hitler-worshipping, the weird religion, the deceptive recruiting
practices, the outright lying, the perverted sexual obsession, and
the homophobia had nothing to do with it?
<li>
And the smug self-righteousness and arrogant sanctimoniousness had
nothing to do with it?
<li>
And the Buchmanites' insistence that only they had a hot-line to God,
and that everyone else was insane, had nothing to do with it?
<li>
And Buchman's declarations that workers were selfish and immoral if
they wanted higher wages had nothing to do with it?
</ul>
<p>
Garth Lean's book says, &quot;Why was he opposed? For the same reason as Jesus
and His disciples were opposed.&quot; <font size="-1">(Page 270.)</font>
<i>Yeh, right</i>.
<p>
Jesus had a name for people like Frank Buchman, who do evil while
wrapping themselves in the Bible: &quot;wolves in sheep's clothing.&quot;
<p>
Those Buchmanites were so insane and so weird and so evil
that sometimes it becomes difficult to
believe that this is all for real. Someone out there must be
wondering if I am making all of this
up. I can only say, &quot;I wish, because if my imagination were
really that good, and that wild and
crazy and demented, then I could make a whole lot of money as a
Hollywood script writer.&quot;
<p>
How about a new slasher horror movie, &quot;The Vampire Vicar&quot;?
&quot;The Meeting Monster&quot;? &quot;The Group
Godzilla&quot;? &quot;The Buchmanites from Brazil&quot;? Oops!
That one's been used. &quot;An American
Werewolf in London&quot;? Nope, that one's been done too.
<p>
Oh well, enough of Buchman.
Let's go on to something else equally depressing.
