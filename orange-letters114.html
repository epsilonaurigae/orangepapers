I love your truth and your writings. I am an ex AA and all these wonderful
supposedly friends I had are gone. I received much criticism from them and its such
BS,  I can definitely witness their cult-like shunning of me.  I am very interested
in writing and exposing AA from Christian point of view.  AA is not Christian.
I have
emails from Dick B. He refuses to look at the facts.  He is deceived too and full of
lies.  I can send you the emails if you like?

<p>
Thank you so much<br>

Hello Dana,
<p>
You can of course send me emails. I had come to the same conclusion myself about
the heresy of A.A. and the Oxford Groups. The truth is, A.A. and
the Oxford Groups have the same theology,
because A.A. started as just some splinter groups broken off of the Oxford Groups
&#8212; off of the New York and Akron Oxford Groups, to be precise.
And both the Oxford Groups and A.A. have grossly heretical and unChristian doctrines and
theology &#8212; even anti-Christian attitudes.
You have probably already seen my file on
<a href="orange-heresy.html">The Heresy of the 12 Steps</a>.
Perhaps you can think of a few issues that I overlooked.

<p>
I like Dick B's scholarship and respect for the truth. Alas, I think he has
far too high of an opinion of the Oxford Groups. He thinks they were bringing
a message from God and doing good things. I have the opposite opinion of Frank
Buchman and the Oxford Groups.
<p>
I look at the whole mess and I can envision a Hollywood
horror movie where both Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson get a visit from the
Devil &#8212; he just pops up out of the ground and asks with a wicked grin,

<p>
Your article about A.A. being heretical was quite good, and I wanted to ask
you if you are Catholic?  The same self refuting and contradictory
'theology' that is present in A.A. is also present in all Protestant
'denominations' and only the Catholic Faith is true (not the false Vatican
II sect run by antipope Benedict XVI).  There is no salvation outside the
Catholic Church and I urge you to learn the faith and convert, for
salvation.

Hello David,

No, I'm not Catholic. However, I do see some common threads of criticism

A wide variety of priests and ministers found Buchmanism to be heretical.

If you are an example of sobriety, then you can keep it.<br>

From:  	&quot;Sarah T&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: Your website has liberated my mind<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
I am elated that there is someone out there not afraid to tell the truth about the
radically illogical and harmful doctrine and practice that is alcoholics anonymous.
(and all other 12 step groups for that matter and the recovery movement as a
whole.) I am also overjoyed that you do so with facts, extensive research, tact, and
beautiful articulation. I commend you for your efforts.

<p>
I officially quit AA about two weeks ago and during the nine months that I attended
I always felt that something was a little bit off. The superstition, lies,
craziness, and insignificant ritual run rampant in the rooms.. When I first started
attending I was willing to bypass all of that just to get the feeling that I
belonged and to create good sober friendships. I was quite lonely at the time I
joined. The love bombing definitely appealed to my ego. I googled AA cult and your
site was the first one listed. I was quite intrigued and read a plethora of the
information on your web site. Even before I discovered your web site I had already
thought about a lot of the things you mention, especially my great disagreement with
the disease model.

<p>
After the intial confusion about the reality of AA and its religious cultism I felt
the happiest I had ever been sober, and not to mention vastly liberated. The first
day that it all came clear to me, I felt frightened and a bit like neo from the
matrix when morpheus revealed the truth to him. I know the confusion came from the
brainwashing that I got from AA which resulted in some cognitive dissonance and my
needing to extricate myself from all the false beliefs I learned there.
<p>
Every
stepper that I have mentioned these truths to all pretty much say the same things.
They parrot the slogans (for example one guy told me &quot;My best thinking is what got
me here.&quot;), claim that AA has saved millions of lives, and that they owe their life
to AA for getting sober and for all the gifts that they receive from the program.
<p>
One guy suggested to me the common AA slogan of &quot;Take what you like and leave the
rest.&quot;
<br>
I said,  &quot;What happens when there is nothing I'd like to take?&quot;
<p>
I also can't stand it when steppers make the fictitious claim that
you're not a &quot;real alcoholic&quot; if you completely disagree with
the 12-step religion and wish to maintain your sobriety in a different way.
(Like um how about quitting for good and moving on with your life!)

<p>
I have also read several of the letters you receive from the AA true believers and
fanatical steppers. Un fucking believable! They are as much a source of
entertainment as they are of clear cut examples that AA truly is a religious cult
and it goes to show how frightened some people are of just a little bit of truth.
(I say a little bit of truth because I have noticed a trend among the AA true believers
who write you and refuse to read anymore of your documents after just a little bit
of exposure, and yet they continue to debate with you with their astounding
ignorance.) Yikes!

<p>
Well orange, since I have accessed this new information, I feel like a fire has lit
inside my soul. I feel impassioned over this societal issue and I wish there was
more I could do. It sickens me that 2/3 of AA's members are coerced into being
indoctrinated into this silly cult by the legal system.. I secretaried for a period
of time and I signed quite a bit of court papers. I am young and maybe a little
idealistic but I want to effect change regarding this whole issue. Could you give
any suggestions on how I can get the truth out there and perhaps in someway create a
movement that would be propelled towards the direction of making it illegal for
courts to send people there?
<p>
Also I have these wonderful visions of creating a
program that is for alcoholics and drug addicts that is successful like AA
(successful in the sense that AA is so widespread, accessible, and international.
Obviously not successful in helping people with such problems!) but
without the bullshit, dogma, and lies, and a program that allows itself to be
studied and is backed by scientific research, and that is always open to revising
itself if it proves to be more helpful to the alcoholic or addict. How do you think
I can accomplish that or at least kick start it?

<p>
Well thank you for reading all of this and kudos to you for your sobriety and your
wonderful contribution to humanity!

<p>
all the best,
Sarah

Subject: re: <a href="orange-not_good.html">whats not good about AA</a>...<br>

<p>
Hello my name is Jack and I am an alcoholic...

<p>
I am appalled by this. you just don't get it do you? are you an alcoholic or one in
recovery? Because if you are or were you would understand. religious dogma? I am a
agnostic and I do not actually have any fundamental religion to speak of but I was
not turned away because I refused to pray or recant the devil just to stop drinking
and needed help from people who know best... other alcoholics. nor was i turned off
by this overt religion you talk of. all books that AA use word the concept of god
thus. &quot;God as you understand him&quot; additionally in most cases you will find people
talk of a higher power, I have felt that higher power in the friendship and love of
my fellowship brothers and sisters. However you are entitled to your view however
misinformed it is.

<p>
I know the only thing that stops me drinking is knowing that I have a friend on the
other end of a phone who is there when my resolve falters.

<p>
I am sure that you could quote any number of studies that either prove or disprove
AA efficacy, all I can say is that I know I would not be here today if it were not
for the friends I have and the knowledge that a moral framework (however outdated it
may be) provided me with the structure and direction to beat a very real demon for
me and that was booze.

<p>
I was sat in my room one night with a bottle of vodka in one hand and a gun in the
other. the only thing that stopped me pulling the trigger was the non judgmental
voice on the end of the phone who said he could help. he did and I am here today
because of it.

<p>
You don't understand alcoholics, we have little or no self belief, all that AA
promotes is a way of getting that self respect back.

<p>
I urge you to attend an open meeting (many are held to allow non alcoholics  to
attend) and look a recovering alcoholic in the eye and see if they are lying when
they say they were saved by the fellowship.

<p>
I personally would trust my sponsor (30 years sober) over any doctor anytime, even
though he openly admits the only thing that stops him drinking is with the help and
the strength of others and his ability to give something back by helping others in
turn.

<p>
I applaud and support you right to free speech and am only offering my own opinion,
unlike your web page I choose to do my work quietly and without sensationalism. we
support ourselves and never ask for money from anyone. the reason the government
involves recovering alcoholics in its drug and alcohol rehabilitation schemes is
because we do understand how addictive minds work and we do know how to give someone
a choice, that's it just a choice.

<p>
Very respectfully yours

<font color="blue">
Hello Jack,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the viewpoint.
<p>
Well, you start with the standard A.A. attack:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;You aren't a real alcoholic &#8212;  you just don't get it &#8212; 
you don't understand, and you don't know anything &#8212; 
you aren't really in recovery &#8212;
or you would agree with Bill Wilson's superstitions.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
Wrong. I am an alcoholic, and I have 8 years of sobriety now. Also 8 years off of all
drugs, including tobacco, and it sure does feel better. So I very much understand
alcoholism.  I just disagree with Bill Wilson' version of Dr. Frank Buchman's cult
religion.

<p>
Then you declare that you are an agnostic who is welcomed in the
A.A. religious program.
That must be fun &#8212; sort of like being the token Negro at a KKK rally.

<p>
When you say,<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;I have felt that higher power in the friendship and love of
my fellowship brothers and sisters&quot;,
</font>
you are elevating mere emotions to the level of a &quot;god&quot;
or a supernatural force. But that isn't spirituality or a &quot;higher power&quot;.
It's just feelings.
Isn't there an A.A. slogan that says, &quot;Feelings aren't facts&quot;?

<p>
William James, remember him? Bill Wilson wrote in the <i>Big Book</i>
that he got the core
of the Alcoholics Anonymous philosophy from William James (page 28)
and Carl Jung (page 26), remember?
Well, William James wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
 If merely &quot;feeling good&quot; could decide, drunkenness
 would be the supremely valid human experience.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
William James (1842&#8212;1910), U.S. psychologist,
 philosopher, in &quot;The Varieties Of Religious
 Experience&quot;, lecture 1, &quot;Religion and Neurology&quot; (1902)
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
So don't put so much stock in those warm and fuzzy feelings of
&quot;friendship and love&quot;.

<p>
The sad thing is, that so-called
&quot;friendship and love&quot; will vanish in a flat minute if you
announce that you are quitting A.A. Try it some time if you don't believe
me. Just announce that you are quitting A.A. and going your own way now,
and see how your &quot;friends&quot; treat you after that. I have received many letters
lamenting the fact that the &quot;unconditional love&quot; is actually
very conditional, and all of those &quot;true friends&quot; will dump you in a minute
if you stop parroting the cult dogma.



<p>
You are speaking in euphemisms when you say things like &quot;A.A. gave you structure
and direction&quot;.
<br>
What structure? What direction? What does that actually mean?
That's just a couple of buzz-words.
How did that &quot;structure and direction&quot; prevent you
from drinking or committing suicide?


<p>
You were not going to commit suicide. A.A. didn't save you from suicide.
Quit being such a drama queen.
People who are going to commit suicide put the gun in their mouth and pull the trigger.
And that's that. End of story.
<p>
You, on the other hand, picked up a telephone and
started calling around, trying to find somebody to tell you not to do it.
As soon as somebody said something encouraging,
you put the gun down. That wasn't a suicide attempt.

<p>
You could just as easily have called a 
wide variety of help lines or hotlines, and gotten a wide variety of advice,
and you still would have put the gun down and given it a try.
<p>
You were in a desperate and highly-suggestible <i>unfrozen</i> state,
<a href="orange-cultinfo.html">as Dr. Edgar H. Schein called it</a>,
and you would have bought into whatever was shoved
at you that gave you hope.
It just happened to be A.A. that got you. Under other circumstances,
you could have ended up in the Moonies or Scientology or some other
cult, and you would be swearing that they saved your life.

<p>
You badly stereotype alcoholics when you say,<br>
<font color="black">
You don't understand alcoholics, we have little or no self belief, all that AA
promotes is a way of getting that self respect back.
</font>
<br>
I very much understand alcoholics, because I'm one of them, and lots of my
friends and acquaintances are too.
<p>
I, for one, have lots of self-belief, and I can keep myself sober without joining
a cult religion.
<p>
What you don't seem to see is that alcoholics are
not all alike. They are all different.
You cannot make such sweeping statements about alcoholics and declare that they
are all a certain way.
(Well, you can do it, but the statements won't be true.)
But that's what A.A. does as it puts alcoholics down.
Read the file on
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">The <i>'Us Stupid Drunks'</i> Conspiracy</a>
for much more about that.  A.A. has no respect for alcoholics.

<p>
Oh, and the A.A. put-down routine does just the opposite of what you declared.
A.A. isn't about getting your self-respect back &#8212; A.A. is about you learning that
you are weak and defective and selfish and dishonest and full of &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;
and &quot;defects of character&quot;, and unable to make it on your own.
A.A. teaches that alcoholics are a disgusting lot.

<p>
And again, you invoke the A.A. stereotype of &quot;the stupid alcoholic&quot;
when you declare that &quot;addictive minds&quot; need the government
to force them into programs whose staffers include cult members
(for their own good, of course).
Maybe ordinary people can live without cult religion, but not those
&quot;addictive minds&quot;. They need cult members to tell them what to do,
because nobody understands like a cult member does.

<p>
Question: If you have such a terrible &quot;addictive mind&quot;,
why should I believe anything that you say?<br>
Won't you just lie to me to continue your addictive behavior
(like defending and denying your addiction to a cult)?

<p>
By the way, I've been to many A.A. and N.A. meetings. Obviously, you haven't even
read
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="newwin35">the introduction</a> to the web site.
Please read <a href="orange-intro.html" target="newwin34">the introduction</a>.
And then read
<a href="orange-letters10.html#missing" target="newwin33">this</a>.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	nhwineguy<br>
Subject:  	free will<br>

<p>
It is curious that you claim you have stopped drinking simply by exercising free
will, and that you encourage others to try to do the same. Since it works for you,
it will work for them? Many have tried and have failed. Many have tried to sustain
countless other courses of action (or inaction) by exerting their will. And while
some succeed and some fail in willing things to be, the vast majority of humans
develop habits and traits in their emotions, thoughts and subsequent actions that
seem often to render free will irrelevant.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello WineGuy,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
First off, I object to the characterization that I &quot;stopped drinking
simply by exercising free will&quot;. That is A.A. jargon and terminology, not mine.
<p>
That is the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#misrepresent" target="newwin44">
Mischaracterize Your Opponent's Statements</a>.
I never said that people had to quit drinking by &quot;exercising free will&quot;.

<p>
I don't recall ever having said that we humans even have free will.<br>
I see little reason to believe that such a thing exists.<br>
I think the jury is still out on that question.<br>
Free will is more of a theological concept than a medical concept.
<p>
What does exist is common sense, and people reacting to pain &#8212;
perhaps using a little logic like,<br>
&quot;If I continue to drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes, then
I will continue to suffer pain.<br>
&quot;But if I quit drinking and smoking, then I just might get healthy
and feel a whole lot better.&quot;
<p>
What you call people trying and failing to quit drinking is really people not
wanting to quit drinking. Oh they imagine that they do want to quit drinking,
they say that they do,
and they think that they do, for a few hours or days, or even months, until
the desire to drink builds up, and then they decide that what they
really want to do is drink, so they do.

<p>
That isn't failure. That is successful drinking. They did what they wanted to do.
</font>
<p>
That's not to say free will doesn't exist, it's just that it's not commonly used to
its maximum effect. We use free will primarily to engage our lives in autopilot,
just so we don't have to concern ourselves with the demanding effort of constantly
exerting that very same free will! If we could control the use of our will so
easily, wouldn't the world be a very different place? Wouldn't we avoid getting into
trouble from the start, and make only good decisions, and follow logical, proper
courses of action? We make plenty of mistakes out of ignorance and apathy and sloth,
but if free will were so easily deployed, we would have long since willed ourselves
to be less ignorant and less apathetic and less slothful. The fact is, many of us
are weak-willed.

<p>
<font color="blue">
If you choose to control your free will, then you must have another higher, more
powerful, non-free will to control the free will.
Where did that <i>&Uuml;ber-Will</i> come from?<br>
What will decides to control the free will? Do you control that will?<br>
When did you decide to control the will that controls the will that controls the free will?<br>
(And how far will this thing recurse? It looks like it's going to turn into
an infinite stack of wills controlling the wills below.)
<p>
How can it be free will if it is under the control of something else?<br>
<p>
All of that A.A. talk about free will is just so much crazy cult dogma &#8212; no
connection to reality.
</font>
<p>
That the recovery program of AA asks you to &quot;surrender&quot; that
will does not make it a cult.
The program asks you to surrender because it is a progam of surrender!
Resistence is at the root of the problem for many of us: resistence to honesty, to
accepting help from others, to acknowledging a reality outside of our own ego. Any
group of people that believes strongly and tries to make believers out of
non-believers could be labeled a cult. Orange kool-aid, anyone?

<p>
<font color="blue">
A.A. is a cult for many reasons.
<a href="orange-cult.html">See the cult test</a>.
Demands for
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult">surrender to the cult</a>
are just one of a hundred standard cult characteristics.
A.A. exhibits many others too. In fact, A.A. exhibits the vast majority of them.
<p>
Again, you dive into
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">
the standard Alcoholics Anonymous stereotyping of &quot;the alcoholic&quot;</a>.
So did the previous letter,
<a href="orange-letters114.html#jack">here</a>.
<font color="black">
&quot;Resistance to honesty, to accepting help from others, to acknowledging
a reality outside of our ego.&quot;
</font><br>
<p>
Wow. Those alcoholics are so bad that they should all be shot just to get the garbage
out of the shallow end of the gene pool, shouldn't they?
<p>
And A.A. says that it wants to remove the stigma of alcoholism. Like hell it does.<br>
What A.A. really teaches is that
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#lash_of_alcoholism">alcoholics are immoral
and weak and stupid</a>
and you can't trust one because he will relapse on you.
</font>
<p>
The paradox of AA is that by making a decision to believe in some power greater than
the individual self (not such a far-fetched proposition) one is suddenly faced with
the cold, hard truth that one is responsible for his own actions if nothing else. It
is a common misconception that &quot;turning your will over&quot; somehow means you relinquish
all control to whatever power you choose. No, you are simply giving up your efforts
to control those things you have come to believe are beyond your control. These
would include things such as the weather, the very slow Sunday-drivers in front of
you, and your relationship with alcohol.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is a beautiful example of cult double-talk and nonsense.<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;By surrendering to the cult, I discovered that I was guilty of everything. 
And then I discovered that I wasn't God and couldn't control the weather.&quot;
</font>
</font>
<p>
Now if you feel healthy and sane, and that your relationship with alcohol is
something you do have control over, then AA might not be for you. But if your years
of hard experience and feelings of despair, helplessness and insanity have led you
to believe otherwise, then maybe AA is for you.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That's the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#either_or" target="newwin99">Either/Or Technique</a>&quot;.
Give the reader only two extreme choices and pressure him to choose one of them:
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Either you have no problems with alcohol, or else you have to join Alcoholics Anonymous.&quot;
</font>

<p>
There is a third possibility: Recognize that alcohol is very bad for me and wrecks my life
when I drink it, so I shouldn't drink it,
but I don't have to surrender to any cult religion to not drink alcohol.
I just don't put alcohol in my mouth and swallow it any more.
<p>
Oh, and while we are noticing propaganda tricks, you also used the technique
called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions">Sly Suggestions</a>, as in,
<font color="black">
&quot;...then maybe AA is for you.&quot;</font><br>
Uh, no, cult religion and quack medicine is definitely not for me.
<p>
And I do not have a &quot;relationship with alcohol&quot;. I also don't have
a relationship with cyanide koolaid or household lye, either. They are all just things
that I don't drink, because they are toxic poisons.

</font>
<p>

In no way does AA say you do not
have the free will to choose one way or the other &#8212; of course you do. To relieve
your insanity, AA simply suggests a certain course of action. Some members of AA may
strongly suggest a certain course of action. No handcuffs. Only lawyers and judges
will demand a certain course of action.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, my choice is the one that you didn't list: Abstain from both alcohol and
Alcoholics Anonymous.
</font>
<p>
In giving up our efforts to control all those things beyond our control, we have
freed ourselves to acknowledge that, by definition, everything else must be within
our control. So quite contrary to throwing free will out the window, we must now
admit we have the power to effect many changes in our lives and in the lives of
those around us. We realize our daily decisions and actions play a role in shaping
and re-shaping our destiny, that it is not shaped soley by outside forces acting
upon us.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That's more cultish double-talk. Who cares if you gave up on attempting to control the
weather?
<p>
Now the second part of the paragraph makes sense. I use the same logic to run my life.
And I didn't get that control of my life by surrendering to a cult or
&quot;higher power&quot;.
</font>
<p>
One of the things within our power to change is the way we think. Most of our
recurring thought patterns are simply habits we've developed, and as habits they can
be changed with enough effort. An endless stream of thoughts flows from our
interpretations of the external world and our emotional reactions to it. Negative
emotions can lead to negative thoughts, and in turn more negative emotions. As we
learn to re-structure our reality in the way we perceive the world, we may be
fortunate enough to escape the cycle of negative feedback and to find relief from
some of the fear, anxiety and isolation we feel. The compulsion to drink may
disappear.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Most of that makes sense. It is good to straighten out your thinking and stop
self-damaging behavior. Notice that the words &quot;surrender&quot;,
&quot;higher power&quot;, &quot;free will&quot;, and &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; didn't
appear anywhere in that paragraph.
<p>
But you jump to a conclusion at the end. You assume that people drink alcohol
because of negative emotions and negative thoughts, and that the compulsion
to drink will suddenly disappear if somebody &quot;re-structures their reality.&quot;
That sounds like a lot of wishful thinking, based on few or no facts.
Do you have any actual medical test results to demonstrate that?
<p>
What about the people who drink alcohol
because they are in physical pain, not because they have negative thoughts?
<p>
What about the people who drink alcohol because they have serious psychiatric problems
like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or NPD?

<p>
You see, that's the problem with A.A. explanations and answers:
They are simplistic one-size-fits-all answers that don't really work.
<p>
A concerned doctor said,
&quot;A one-size-fits-all cure is a good way to kill a lot of patients.&quot;
</font>
<p>
In the end, then, it is free will that ultimately but indirectly keeps us from
drinking again. That we need to &quot;fool&quot; ourselves and take a circular route to reach
our destination, is that such a bad thing? That we can't just say &quot;no booze&quot; and be
done with it? That we experience growth and joy and fellowship? Say what you like,
but no, it is not such a bad thing. What you yourself are saying is, after all, no
different than what AA says: why not try it this way? The difference is that most
people who succeed with AA have already tried it your way and failed.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you haven't even shown that &quot;free will&quot; exists. But you keep on yammering
about how you have it, sort of, but you don't have it, when it comes to alcohol.
Nonsense.
That is quintessential cult dogma and double-talk. And it's also some warped thinking,
imagining that you have to fool yourself with loopy illogic.

<p>
And then you finished with another logical fallacy and propaganda trick:
<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;...most people who succeed with AA have already tried it your way and failed.&quot;
</font>
<p>
First off, very few people succeed with Alcoholics Anonymous.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">It's a real death trap</a>.
A.A. kills far more people than it saves. And the A.A failure rate is sky-high.
<a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">Almost nobody makes it in A.A. for 10 years</a>.
<p>
And then, you haven't even honestly or accurately looked at
&quot;my way&quot;, so you don't even know what it is.
You just keep yammering about &quot;free will&quot;.
So &quot;most A.A. success stories&quot; have not already tried it my way before staggering
into the A.A. clubhouse.
<p>
But that is the standard A.A. propaganda:<br>
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;A.A. is the last house on the block.&quot;<br>
&quot;I tried all of the other stuff, and nothing worked.&quot;<br>
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#all_i_know" target="_blank">All I know is</a>, it worked for me.&quot;<br>

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Dianne G.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	your agenda and how you arrived at that agenda-because you certainly have one<br>

<p>
I am a long term member of AA.  I am interested to know if you spend as much time
debunking Christianity and other religions as you spend on AA...these other
&quot;spiritual&quot; programs get a free pass and in my opinion hurt many more people than
they help and costs us as a country much more than AA does in any measurable way,
i.e. tax deductions, no oversight, etc.  AA is really without much hierarchy and you
can always start another meeting and set your own rules for that meeting...I know
you know the phrase...resentment and a coffee pot.

<p>
Is AA flawed?  Absolutely.  Was Bill Wilson a flawed leader and a messenger who had
many issues in his history, 13 stepper, etc.  Is there much in the Big Book that is
flat out made up or history revised....does it reek of  Christian allusions in ways
that I do not like...it is a product of its time.....and Bill Wilson was a product
of his time......but how about checking out the Bible and various .American churches
if you want to see some serious bullshit that really hurts people, drives politics
and as we know from Bush, Inc...(a drunk who did not have any kind of
program)...damned near destroyed the Constitution and has us in two wars, paying for
abstinence only teen programs and other crap that is religion based....(that old
separation of Church/State thing).....religion really hurts specific groups...women,
gays, etc....or the Koran...... I know from my experience that AA does help people
get and stay sober and clean....it reduces terrible social costs to us as a society,
to children caught in its cross hairs, reduces crime...and saves lives..  It saved
mine.....I am an atheist..came in as one...stayed as one  and was told I was
welcome..I was told that AA is a democracy and that I did not have to subscribe to
anyone else's point of view....and that has been my experience.....they did
recommend not drinking and not taking pills.......(anti-depressants were in their
infancy...so was Big Pharma as we know it today...I take no medication...)

<p>
My experience has been that people like you who have a serious hard on for AA are
still drinking or taking pills or doing something that they have to justify...

<p>
Just a few questions for you A. Orange.

<p>
If I have wronged you, please tell me I have and how. I think of myself as a
critical thinker and like to hear arguments from other people about their
positions...does AA have problems...of course..but what is a reasonable
substitute???...if you are a person who has never been addicted to a substance that
was killing you then perhaps you can't really understand this deal on a visceral
level..pills were killing me..I was a social worker...two degrees...bright
girl...and I was dying...AA helped me when I came in in 1984 then and it still helps
me today...

<p>
Thanks.

still drinking or taking pills or doing something that they have to justify...&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is the usual cultish A.A. attack on anyone who criticizes Alcoholics
Anonymous.  And it isn't true at all. I have 8 years sober now, and also 8 years
off of cigarettes and any other drugs. The only pills that I take are the ones
that the doctor prescribes, which are nothing exciting &#8212; anti-acid, cholestrol-lowerer,
and muscle relaxant to stop tremors (which may be residual damage from alcohol).
And vitamins. Lots of vitamins and minerals.
<p>
But A.A. just can't stand the thought that somebody who is very clean and sober
can criticize A.A., so you always have to launch into
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#ad_hominem">that little <i>ad hominem</i> attack</a>.
It's as predictable as the rising and setting of the sun.
<p>
Then you repeated 
<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#ca_denigrate_others">the standard A.A. attack on
competing sects</a>:
<font color="black">
&quot;...religion really hurts specific groups...&quot;.
</font>
You just have to attack those competing religions, don't you?
That behavior is listed as
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_denigrate_others">one of the 100 standard
cult characteristics</a>.

<p>
Now on to the rest of your letter. It's a mess of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#rationalize">rationalizations</a>
and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize">minimization and denial</a>,
something that Bill Wilson said alcoholics are good at.

<p>
Bill Wilson was &quot;a flawed leader and a messenger&quot; just like how
Lafayette Ronald Hubbard, the founder of Scientology,
was &quot;a flawed leader and a messenger&quot;.
Both were seriously mentally ill men who
established abusive cults that were &quot;health and purity movements&quot;, things that
would supposedly liberate you from your bad habits and elevate you into a wonderful
new world of clarity and power.
And both of them just sold a load of crap and quackery.

<p>
The biggest A.A. lie in your letter is:<br>
<font color="black">
&quot;I know from my experience that AA does help people
get and stay sober and clean....it reduces terrible social costs to us as a society...&quot;
</font>
<p>
No,
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial">
A.A. does not work</a>. A.A. does not reduce drinking or improve the alcoholism
situation.  A.A. does not increase the amount of sobriety in this world.
In fact, A.A.'s biggest accomplishments are:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Raising the death rate in alcoholics.</b>
Alcoholics Anonymous Trustee Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant tried to prove
that A.A. works, and instead accidentally proved that A.A. kills.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Look here</a>.
<p>
<li> <b>Raising the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics.</b>
Dr. Jeffrey Brandsma tested A.A., and found that it immensely increased
the rate of binge drinking. The A.A. members were doing FIVE TIMES as much
binge drinking as the &quot;unhelped&quot; alcoholics, and NINE TIMES as much bingeing
as another group of alcoholics who got some Rational Emotive Therapy.
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Look here</a>.
</ol>
<p>
Just because someone quits drinking within 50 feet of an
A.A. clubhouse does not mean that A.A. deserves the credit for that person's sobriety.
People quit drinking alcohol for quite a variety of reasons,
and the 12 Steps are not one of them.
<p>
But when A.A. sponsors tell a newcomer not to take his medications, and that person
dies or commits suicide, or suffers a stroke, or some other equally tragic fate,
then, yes, A.A. is to blame for that death.

<p>
And when
<a href="orange-letters85.html#Midtown_links">
the A.A. sponsors tell the teenage girls to sleep with the old sponsors</a>
in
order to &quot;learn how to have sober sex&quot;, then that is also the fault of A.A.
And when the A.A. headquarters refuses to put a stop to it,
then that is also the fault of A.A.
<p>
Since you say that you are an A.A. old-timer, with lots of experience, please
answer this simple question that A.A. old-timers have never answered honestly:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#9F0000">
What is the REAL A.A. success rate?
<p>
Out of each 1000 newcomers to A.A., how many will pick up a one-year
sobriety medallion a year later? (Or even several years later?)<br>
And how many will get their 2-year, and 5-year, and 10-year coins?<br>
How about 11 years and 21 years?<br>
What percentage of the A.A. newcomers go on to get those things?
</font>
</blockquote>
(HINT: the answers are <a href="orange-letters62.html#coins">here</a>.
<p>
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:  	Recovery<br>

<p>
Hey Orange, I don't dispute anything you have written, I have always believed your
recovery is your own business, what helps you may not be the answer for others. A.A.
has been my answer and now I am closer to God. I know people can just quit or they
find God or they go to treatment, but the sole purpose is to find a relief from the
addiction. I believe you will help as many addicts as any other form of treatment
there is out there just by opening up the eyes of the stricken, you are being a
service, you are being another servant of God, by  opening the eyes of the
afflicted. By reading your work I was amazed how well it was put together and by
reading your work  you will empower people to have the strength to see their
weakness and be able to overcome their addictions. I applaud you. Thank you Jerry
