Thanks for the links. The second one is easy: I feed them rolled oats, which is on the recommended list. They only get a little bread, and it's not white bread. They get whole wheat or 7-grain bread or something like that. And that is just a treat, not a diet.
<p>

It will take a few minutes to go through the arguments of the first file. I can see errors already, but have to carefully read all of it.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
LATER:

<p>

The &quot;hardeybordercollies.com&quot; web page &quot;<i>Ten Reasons Why You
Should Not Feed Wild Waterfowl &amp; Canada Geese</i>&quot;
is a good example of deceptive and untrue propaganda from what I call &quot;Nature Nazis&quot; &#8212; people
who have extreme views of wildlife and try to force their opinions on others.
<p>
Here is the web page:
<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005141/http://hardeybordercollies.com/id91.html" target="_blank"> 
http://hardeybordercollies.com/id91.html</a>

<p>
I'll go through it point by point:

<p>
<ol type="A">
<p><li>
<h2><i>Birds Have Amazing Survival Skills</i></h2>
<p>
Yes, they do, but that doesn't mean that we should not feed them. Most all of the geese's and ducks
native feeding grounds have been stolen from them and turned into farms, where the farmers get eradication
permits to kill the Canada Geese that try to feed on their farms.
<p>
See:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322005141/https://epermits.fws.gov/eRCGR/geSI.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2feRCGR%2fgeSTC.aspx" target="_blank">
https://epermits.fws.gov/eRCGR/geSI.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2feRCGR%2fgeSTC.aspx</a><br>
...where you can register to exterminate Canada Geese.<br>
Also see:
<a href="www.fws.gov/forms/3-200-13.pdf" target="_blank">
www.fws.gov/forms/3-200-13.pdf</a> for the form.

<p>
Saying that we shouldn't feed ducks and geese because they have &quot;amazing survival skills&quot; is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#non_sequitur" target="_blank"><i>Non Sequitur</i></a>.

<p>
The author just assumes that there is a lot of food &quot;out there&quot;, somewhere: &quot;the abundance of 
naturally occurring food.&quot; What abundance? The grassy meadows have been plowed up and turned into farms,
and the swamps have been drained and turned into farms. Native habitat for ducks and geese is
like old-growth forest habitat for Spotted Owls: there is very little of it left,
and somebody is always trying to take what is left.

<p><li>
<h2><i>Food Quality Is Critical</i></h2>
<p>
Yes, it is, but this author confuses food types. Baby birds whose parents feed them worms or fish,
like Robins or Eagles, require high-protein diets. Baby geese, on the other hand, eat grass and seeds.
Ducks live on everything and anything from algae and duckweed to worms and insects.

<p>
When feeding the wildlife, one should should always feed quality foods, not junk food. Like rolled oats,
rather than white bread.

<p><li>
<h2><i>A Diet of White Bread Can Be Fatal to Wildfowl.</i></h2>
<p>
I agree. So don't feed them white bread. Feed them rolled oats or whole wheat. Whole grain is the best.
A 40-pound bag of rolled oats costs $11.50 at the local farm feed store.

</ol>

<p>
<ol>

<p><li>
<h2><i>Malnutrition</i></h2>
<p>
The author is guilty of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#generalize" target="_blank">the propaganda trick of way over-generalizing</a>.
He claims that because some people feed wildfowl white bread and
popcorn, that all wildfowl who get some food from humans are suffering from malnutrition. Not so.
<p>
First off, the wildfowl always still scrounge for whatever they need.
The only ones I see who are not very good at scrounging are the domesticated ducks.
Even a domesticated goose like Gus is good at scrounging for greens. (See Gus below.)

<p> 
Wildfowl are not stupid. They have a good idea of what constitutes a balanced diet
for them. They know what they need to eat. They hunger for the things that are
good for them.  When I was hand-feeding Carmen, when
she was less than a week old, she
insisted on filling her stomach three-quarters full of grass first, and then she
would fill the remaining space with cooked rice. She never deviated from that
ratio, and she always insisted on eating the grass first. She was actually
born (hatched) with a built-in idea of what constituted good nutrition for her.
No way was she suffering from malnutrition.
<p>

Carmen standing on her plate of rice and graham cracker crumbs.
</center>

<p><li>
<h2><i>Dependency</i></h2>

<p>
Again, the author exaggerates and way over-generalizes. Wild geese and ducks do not suddenly become
dependent on humans just because they get some supplemental feeding. 
What is the alternative? Are they supposed to just starve to death because the farmer won't let them
feed on his land?
<p>
Among his arguments, the author says that fed birds will lose their fear of humans. And so what is so bad about that?
The Nature Nazis want &quot;pure&quot; wildlife who fear and distrust humans, and have no contact with humans.
What is so great about that? Those crazy purists are foisting their unrealistic ideas on an unwilling population
of animals and humans.
<p>
Then, under the title of &quot;Dependency&quot;, the author slips in all kinds of fear-mongering and misinformation,
like claiming that an aggressive goose can knock down a senior citizen. Well, I'm a senior citizen (66 years old),
and in 12 years of feeding them, I've never been attacked. Not once.
Canada Geese are actually very mellow and easy-going. It's the white domestic geese that will attack you without
provocation. I would not keep white geese around children, because they attack children just out of general meanness.
<p>
Then the author argues in so many ways that the geese should just die, to prevent &quot;overpopulation&quot;, and
&quot;concentration near highways and airports&quot;. And this guy continues to pretend that he loves wildlife.

<p><li>
<h2><i>Disease</i></h2>
<p>
This is a
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#reversal" target="_blank">Reversal Of Reality</a>,
another propaganda trick. Starvation makes them sick, not getting some good supplemental feeding.
<p>
And the author uses the trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>.
He tries to imply that feeding the wildfowl caused his list of diseases. Nonsense. Of course disease outbreaks
occur where the concentrated populations of wildfowl are located. It's like how the
human flu breaks out in the middle of the largest cities long before it appears
on remote farms in Nebraska.
<p>
By the way, just listing three outbreaks of disease is the use of two propaganda tricks:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">Cherry-Picking</a>
and
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof By Anecdote</a>.
He never mentions how many other times the birds didn't get sick.

<p><li>
<h2><i>Environmental Degradation</i></h2>
<p>
This is another <a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">Confusion of Correlation and Causation</a>.
Concentrate the wildfowl in one small territory by taking all of their territory and making it into
farms, highways, cities, streets, buildings and parking lots, and then complain that the overcrowded 
wildlife are &quot;degrading their environment&quot;. So what is the author's answer? Just to let the wildfowl die off
so that there aren't so many of them in a small space.
 

<p><li>
<h2><i>Water Pollution</i></h2>
<p>
This is another gross deception. Cites dump millions of gallons of sewage water into rivers and lakes, and
then they claim that the geese are polluting the water.
<p>
The Fernhill Wetlands is the dumping ground for waste water from the city of Forest Grove's sewage treatment
plant. After 10,000 people defacate in the water, you won't even notice what a few geese and ducks do.
And there are nasty algae blooms during the summer, all right, but they are caused by all of the phosphates in
the water from detergents.

<p>
Besides, the author is using another propaganda trick there:
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#assume">Assume The Major Premise</a>.
He assumes that feeding wildlife makes them poop in the water. Not so.
The truth is, the ducks always poop
in the water. It's just what they do, and they will do it no matter whether they get some muchies from
humans or just eat lots and lots of algae, weeds, worms, and insects.
Geese, on the other hand, tend to poop on the grass, which is why some people hate them eating the
grass in city parks. And they poop more when they have to eat a lot of low-calorie grass to get their
nourishment, and less if they are eating some whole wheat bread and rolled oats.


<p><li>
<h2><i>Increased Hybridization</i></h2>
<p>
Oh horrors! Blacks and Whites having sex together, and making babies! Miscegenation! Racial Impurity!
Mixing of the races!
<p>
Now the Nazi attitudes of the purists are really becoming obvious. We just can't have those inferior
<i>Untermenschen</i> polluting our pure &quot;wild&quot; blood now, can we?

<p>
Again, much ado about nothing. Cross-breeding among the geese is rare.
I have only seen two instances of it in 12 years of
feeding the geese.  In Waterfront Park in downtown Portland, Oregon,
&quot;Jefferson&quot; was a pure white big fat honking male goose who liked to jump on those
pretty French Canadian Geese, and he produced one son. That son produced another child, who produced another.
The line went on for three or four generations, and then died out. That's the thing: If the hybrids are
inferior, then Mother Nature eliminates them. Evolution is still going on. Survival of the fittest.
So we don't need Nature Nazis demanding Racial Purity.
<p>
The other instance of cross-breeding is Gus the Greylag Goose at the Fernhill Wetlands at Forest Grove, Oregon.
He married a Canada Goose female (they mate for life, you know), and each of the last three years,
 they have had children. But only one
child has survived each year. I love Gus, but have to admit that sometimes he isn't the sharpest pencil
in the box. He doesn't seem to be as quick-witted as the Canada Geese, and neither are his children.
So the weasel or ermine or eagle picks them off, and he has had only one child survive each of the last three
years. We shall see whether they survive in the long run.
<p>

Gus and Family
</center>


<p>
The ducks are much more into miscegenation. People have been dumping all kinds of domestic ducks at the
Fernhill Wetlands, and they have interbred and also bred with Mallard Ducks, and produced some real mongrels
that are a little of everything.
But they are dying out too. There used to be a dozen of them, but they are down to five, all males.
I think that the weasel or ermine got the females while they were sitting on their nests.

The gang of Mongrel Ducks
</center>


<p>
Again, Mother Nature will take care of the situation, like she has been doing for the last four billion years
without any help from humans who want to enforce racial purity.
<p>
By the way, you might notice that Mother Nature does not like to enforce racial purity at all. She wants to mix
the genes up and try every combination and every mixture of breeds. Then natural selection eliminates the
inferior ones. And life goes on.


<p><li>
<h2><i>Delayed Migration</i></h2>
<p>
The whole planet is cooking from Global Warming, and this guy is complaining about
delayed migration, and imagining that it is caused by feeding the geese?  Geez Louise.
That is the propaganda trick of <a href="orange-propaganda.html#nonfactor" target="_blank">Blame A Non-Factor</a>.

<p>
By the way, it isn't just the geese and ducks that are migrating late. Lots of
species are doing it, from whales to caribou to other birds. And those animals
are not getting food from humans. Ecologist are citing the delayed migrations of
so many species as real evidence of global warming.

<p><li>
<h2><i>Overcrowding in Unnatural Sites</i></h2>
<p>
Again, this is the fault of greedy humans who took all of the best land for themselves, and left
the wildlife the worst. In Forest Grove, for instance, the Fernhill Wetlands is the dumping ground
for the city's sewage treatment plant waste water. That's what the wildlife get. Sewage water. And then
this guy complains about the wildlife living in unnatural locations?
<p>
And what is this author's answer to &quot;overcrowding&quot;? It is to have them die.

<p><li>
<h2><i>Costly Management Efforts</i></h2>
<p>
What do you expect? Take away their lands and food sources, and then complain that they want to feed on
somebody's farm? And it costs money to kill them? This is draconian.
<p>
Notice that if I am feeding geese over at the wildlife refuge, then the geese don't need to fly to
the farmer's field to get something to eat, and he doesn't have to pay money to kill them. Funny how that works.


<p><li>
<h2><i>Devaluation</i></h2>
<p>
This is insane. I mean, really insane. The author says that we should not feed the
geese and ducks, just let them starve to death, and then he accuses those people
who love the wildlife and want to help the geese and ducks and be friends with
them of &quot;devaluing them&quot;? That is barking-mad insanity.
<p>
And it's another <a href="orange-propaganda.html#reversal" target="_blank">Reversal Of Reality</a>.
It's the people who think that the wildlife should starve to death to
&quot;reduce overcrowding&quot; who devalue them.

<p><li>
<h2><i>Keep Our Wildfowl Wild</i></h2>
<p>
That is impossible, given that there is no wilderness left. Like Indians killed off and forced onto
reservations, the wildlife are restricted to a few &quot;wildlife refuges&quot; where they are supposed to starve.
And the author calls that &quot;keeping them wild&quot;.
<p>
The slogan &quot;<i>Keep Our Wildfowl Wild</i>&quot;
is an example of the propaganda trick called
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#glittering_generality" target="_blank">The Glittering Generality</a>.
The author of that page imagines that if we just don't feed the wildlife, that everything will be wonderful.

<!--
<P><li>
Then the author finishes with an American flag. Yay, let's wave the flag as we starve the wildlife.

It is me again,(don't know if you remember.)  Well I am much better.
Haven't had a drop in 6 months or so, and have no plans to.  :) Feels great. I just
wanted to say I am so happy you are still at it.  I love your views, pictures of the
geese, I honestly have always loved hippies.  I'm originally from Eugene, ORE, what
can I say.  :)  I live above a pond and have geese around here.  Love watching them
and think of you while watching them.  You have a STRONG spirit. I have told many
professionals about your site, including therapists, psychiatrists, and professor's.
Some thought whoa he's angry, however some were very interested. I think you SHOULD
start the other site about corporations. Who knows maybe it will start a revolution
here in the states.  :)  God knows we need one.Take care of yourself,
<p>

Hello Jennifer,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and all of the compliments.
Yes, I remember you. I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. Congratulations.
That's great news.
<p>
And your letter wasn't too disorganized. I know how hard it is to type into those
little text boxes on web pages and try to get things right with basically no text
editing or formatting tools. I prefer to edit files on my own computer and then
upload the finished file to a web page, if at all possible.
Trying to tell a good story in those small boxes on a Facebook page is frustrating.

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

Subject:  	Quite confused. Not hate mail!!!!<br>

<p>
I've just spent about 3 hours reading your page, which just completely reinforced
what I already thought of AA: that it is a cult of self flagellating religious nuts,
that i want nothing to do with. I'm on my ipad, so maybe I'm missing something, but
I never managed to find any info about your opinion on what a positive, healthy
recovery would look like (outside of the 5% or so who achieve a spontaneous one).
I'd love to see more info on that. I REALLY don't need much convincing about AA; my
dad died of cirrhosis when I was 10, 18 years ago. He was 48, and a seasoned alumni
of AA and several other programs, all similar: abstain completely or die, one slip
makes you a bad person, might as well just give up until you are ready to start
over....that sort of thing. Part of that 95% failure rate. I fear suffering the same
fate every day, although I'm not suffering the ill consequences of drinking....yet.
I even get into the &quot;am I just in denial?&quot; mindset on a regular basis.

<p>
I fear that I won't know when I finally cross the line, I fear that my only option
will be to become religious (I'm NOT) in order to get a support system or a
framework for help, if i realize its not worth it to drink.

<p>
I'm not trying to be critical/criticize in a negative sense, but rather looking for
some information on something other than on what I already know AA to be...a pile of
crap. As you say over and over....most people aren't going to stop themselves, most
of us aren't going to just yank ourselves up by our own bootstraps and decide enough
is enough.

<p>
So what IS there for those of us who will just drink more when we feel bad, and call
up a friend who is okay with that to hang out with that day? Because I see that in
myself. It scares me. It scares me because it could happen on a regular basis pretty
easily. I, personally, would like help of a different variety than what is available
out there, if and when I decide I need it. I'd love to see you add more of that!

<p>
I know that most people take a lot of convincing to let go of their
culturally-ingrained idea of AA, but for those of us who are convinced....now what?

<p>
I actually just watched a television show the other day where a guy had
two...TWO...sips of champagne and that was played out to the viewer as a huge lapse
in character on his part...and then he went to an AA meeting and said he had only
been sober for 5 hours and that was supposed to be touching for the viewer. PLEASE.
HE WAS NEVER NOT SOBER, and he never failed morally.

I'm really glad I stumbled upon this site because it articulates a lot of what I
have felt about recovery programs.... thank you for that. Someone had to say it, no?
90% of them are malarkey snake oil sales for people who just want help, and the
biggest moral failing isn't a relapse on the addicts part but rather a failure on
the part of our society to accept that people are human, and that the (only legal)
drug we are peddling on every corner is addictive.

<p>
I just wish you had more answers I suppose... heheh. Maybe you should start a cult,
call it Drinkers Confidential, and solve all your money problems, right? I
understand no one has the answers :)

Sorry to email bomb you, but after my last message I went back to the home page and
scrolled to my right (as i said im on my ipad... apparently ive got it quite zoomed
in) and found your &quot;solution&quot; stuff. I'm sorry for questioning, I haven't read it
yet, but please disregard my earlier questions, although the THANK YOU part and
other stuff still stands. :)

Hi again,
<p>
I also wanted to tell you that I had to just laugh at the guy who said  &quot;i don't
need statics to know that my life is better.&quot; He reminds me of the people who say &quot;I
don't need your so-called &quot;facts&quot; you &quot;intellectual&quot; SNOB!&quot; to me regularly. My
degree is in sociology but my undergrad favorite was statistics; I return for
graduate school with a focus in stats in May. I hear there is a lot of money to be
made by female statisticians, and I'm good at it :) I will NEVER, never understand
those who say statistics don't matter, or even that statistics can lie. PEOPLE can
manipulate statistics, to be deceiving (it is quite simple, on TV every day!) but
pure numbers are real and can't lie, because they aren't alive, aren't subjective,
as people are, and are based on universal fact.

<p>
So these people who keep telling you that your statistics don't matter because they
were the one in a million who were &quot;saved&quot; and that you are killing people.... ignore
them. Take heart, Fellow human. You are doing the right thing. The truth is never
wrong to speak.

<p>
And you know you are speaking truth because you have facts on your side, not
&quot;feelings&quot; or &quot;beliefs.&quot; You know for sure. You definitely have my respect. You're
definitely not in the &quot;opinion&quot; section considering your documentation and facts.

Hello Crystal,
<p>
Thank you for the letters and the compliments. 
<p>
You actually brought up an interesting question in your first letter:
&quot;what a positive, healthy recovery would look like.&quot;
I think you meant what a good recovery program would look like, but at first I took it the
other way, and wondered what a description of a good sober lifestyle would look like.
And I thought, &quot;Hmmm... that's difficult, because they are all different. That is, someone
who stops killing himself with alcohol and finds something else to do with his life could
do anything: Go back to college, or resume a career, or get married and have kids, or even
go to the beach and lay in the sun and feed the goslings.&quot;

<p>
About ways to recover, yes, I trust that you found:
<a href="orange-letters191.html#what_works" target="_blank">How did you get to where you are?</a><br>
And the list other, saner, recovery groups and methods:
 <a href="orange-alt_list.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-alt_list.html</a><br>
<p>
That second list includes Moderation Management. I noticed your remark about the
extremists who insist that absolute abstinence is the only way. The worst part is
teaching the idea of powerlessness, and that you will totally relapse if you have
one drink. That becomes a self-fullfilling prophesy with many people. That is a
really bad teaching and does a lot of harm.  What SMART teaches is: If you have
a drink, or go to a party and get buzzed one night, then that is a &quot;lapse&quot;,
not a &quot;relapse&quot;. And the thing to do is just stop drinking again. When
you fall off of the horse, just climb back up on the horse and ride it some more.
Don't continue to drink and make a lapse into a full-blown relapse.

<p>
There is also HAMS and the Harm Reduction Network. Dr. Peter Ferentzy has been sending
me a bunch of news about what they are doing in Canada, and
<a href="orange-letters347.html#Peter_F" target="_blank">I've been mirroring it here</a>.

I find that a very practical approach, because they have a good chance of helping people
who will just walk away if you start talking about total abstinence. And the logic is good:
If you can't get them to stop their addiction, at least reduce the harm done. We don't
really need all of the junkies also becoming expensive AIDS patients.

<p>
Now to clarify, some people can drink moderately, and some can't. It all depends
on the individual person.
Many years ago, way back in 1978, the famous government think tank,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="newwin77">the Rand Corporation, found</a>
that the successful people who had stopped drinking self-destructively
were evenly split between total abstinence and tapering off into
moderate, controlled, drinking. So total abstinence is not the only way.
It all depends on the individual person. Of course, the A.A. true believers flipped out when
the Rand Corporation released that report. (More on that
<a href="orange-letters235.html#Rand_Corp" target="_blank">here</a>.)
<p>
Now I'm not recommending that anybody drink alcohol. I'm just saying that one drink does not
necessarily end all recovery and instantly readdict all alcoholics. Some yes, some no.
<p>
Personally, I'm one of those people who has to 100% avoid alcohol, or I slide back
down that slippery slope very quickly. But that's okay, because I'm tired of being
sick from alcohol anyway. No big loss. I already got my lifetime quota of that
kind of suffering. I don't need any more of that.
<p>
I certainly don't want to force my style of recovery onto other people. Whatever works.
Different strokes for different folks.

<p>
About the statistics, I find that the people who refuse to hear the numbers, and don't tell
the truth about the numbers, are those people who prefer to live in a fairy tale rather than
in the real world. They <i>really</i> don't want to know the truth.
<p>
And yes, I've heard the accusations and complaints about bad statistics so many times.
I know what deceptive manipulations can be done with statistics. I even have Darrell Huff's classic
book
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Darrell_Huff" target="_blank"><i>How To Lie With Statistics</i></a>
listed in the bibliography, and I use some of his examples
and techniques in the web page about
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#Huff2" target="_blank">Propaganda and Debating Techniques</a>.

And I know about the famous quote that is attributed to both the British Prime
Minister Desraeli and to Mark Twain,
<b>&quot;There are three kinds of lies: Little white lies, damn lies, and statistics.&quot;</b>
<p>
I also like this quote:

<p>
Yes, not all numbers are lies. And as you well know, a good statistician uses
numbers to get at the truth, not to decieve and fool people and perpetrate a fraud.
<p>
Unfortunately, A.A. uses numbers to perpetrate a fraud. All of their claimed success rates
are untrue, and so wrong that they aren't even in the right ballpark. It isn't a matter of a
small mistake, it's a matter of a huge lie. I covered much of that here:<br>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">
http://www.orange-papers.info/orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial</a>
<p>
And finally, you really don't have to go down the same road as your father did. Yes, it is very
good to be wary, as there does seem to be a genetic component to alcohol addiction in about half of the
cases. But just because you have a gene that makes you more inclined to get addicted to alcohol
doesn't mean that you have to do it. And even if you do get addicted, like I did, and just like how Dad and Grandma
did, you can just get unaddicted, like I did (and they didn't).

<p>
Have a good day now, and a good life.

</center>
After they ate the rolled oats, they went to this slope where years of rain had washed away the dirt and exposed
lots of little stones and gravel, and they picked out crop stones to swallow. Birds do not have teeth, so they
have crops to grind their food. The crop is a muscular bag before the stomach that the birds fill with small
stones, sand, and gravel, and the crop grinds their food for them. So all of the grain that they eat ends up
being &quot;stone ground&quot;, just like the loaves of whole wheat bread advertise.
So here they are, carefully picking out just the right little stones to swallow.
<p>
By the way, you really can hear their crops grinding. One of the funniest experiences I had with Carmen
was when she walked up to me and looked at me plaintifly with her crop grinding, and I could hear it grinding.
It's a sort of swish-swish sound, like the sound of sand rubbing together.
A baby bird's crop grinding is much like a human's stomach growling when they are
hungry.  And I got the message, &quot;Oh, okay, so you are
hungry, huh? Empty crop? Well, let's get you some more food to eat.&quot;

Subject:  	World Health Organization says that AA is &quot;cult' like, anti-medication and potentially harmful.<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

The World Health Organization in the Mental Health section of its website
provides:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


&quot;Evidence-based recommendations for management of alcohol use disorders in
non-specialized health settings&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

Here, the WHO asks the question:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


&quot;Should non-specialist health care providers refer alcohol dependent
patients and their family members to mutual help groups such as AA?&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

In its reply to the question the WHO evaluates the &quot;Balance of benefits
versus harms&quot;. The following is the WHO's opinion:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


&quot;As these groups are outside the treatment system they are known to
sometimes develop &quot;cult&quot; like behaviours. They can also be very against the
use of medications. There is the potential for harm.&quot;
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Weirdly in its Final Recommendations the WHO states:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Non-specialist health care workers should be encouraged to familiarise
themselves with locally available mutual help groups (such as AA), and they
should encourage the alcohol dependent patient to engage with such a group.&quot;<br>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

How can the WHO state that AA is cult like, anti-medication with the
potential for harm and then recommend that alcoholics be encouraged to
attend AA? A more than slightly mixed message.

<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Still, when the world Health Organization recognizes AA as &quot;cult&quot; like that
really is a huge step forward in changing the treatment system.

Hello iamnotastatistic,
<p>
Thanks for all of the information. I can only agree.
 Alas, I think that even WHO is suffering from a certain kind
of informational cowardice that is common to bureaucracies. In the interests of "fair and balanced coverage",
so that they can't be accused of bias,
they just have to say good things about both sides.
It makes me think of a priest saying,

<p>

Hi Orange,
I know that you've thoroughly dealt with the subject of the 100 Men
Corporation so maybe you've already dealt with this but I thought these
quotes were interesting:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


&quot;How we got through the summer of 1939, I'll never quite know. Hank P. had

</blockquote>


<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

Why does Wilson refer to the shares given to Ruth Hock as &quot;shares in the
defunct book company&quot;? Wilson couldn't have been referring to shares in
Works Publishing Co. since it wasn't incorporated until June 1940. In fact,
Works Publishing only existed in Wilson's head during the summer of 1939.
And, Works Publishing could never have been described as defunct &#8212; it came
into existence and has stayed in existence ever since &#8212; only the name has
changed.
<p>
So the shares that Ruth Hock was given could only have been shares in the
100 Men Corporation. Otherwise there is no logical reason to refer to
shares in Works Publishing as &quot;shares in the defunct book company&quot; since
Works Publishing was never defunct. It must have been tough for Wilson to
keep track of all the lies.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Ah, good catch. I must have read that text a few dozen times, and yet the word &quot;defunct&quot; somehow slipped
by without me connecting the dots. I knew that
<a href="orange-aacoa.html#meaningless" target="_blank">
 Ruth Hock had to be getting stock</a>
 in
<a href="orange-prospectus.html" target="_blank">the 100 Men Corporation</a>
because &quot;Works Publishing, Inc.&quot; did not exist, and wouldn't exist for another year.
<p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>It was April, 1939. Henry, absolutely broke</b>, was
trying to get work. <b>Ruth, living at home, was given
<font color="#9F0000">meaningless stock certificates</font>
in the defunct Works Publishing as pay.</b> She cheerfully
accepted these and never slackened her efforts. All of us were
going into debt just for living expenses.<br>
</font>
<i>Alcoholics Anonymous Comes Of Age</i>, page 173
</blockquote>

<p>
But Bill wrote that the publishing company (the 100 Men Corporation) was already
&quot;defunct&quot; in April of 1939 when they were writing the <i>Big Book</i>?
So Bill was inadvertently admitting that there was another publishing company in
existence before Works Publishing, which is one of the most closely-guarded secrets
in A.A. history.
Even though Bill Wilson called the defunct publishing company &quot;Works Publishing&quot;
in his falsified history, the defunct company could not possibly be Works Publishing
because Works Publishing didn't come into existence until a year later.  Ah yes. Good catch.


</font>
<p>

Also, Wilson wrote in Alcoholics Anonymous comes of Age:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">


&quot;Four hundred shares of stock [Bill's &amp; Hank's] had never been issued and
could not be issued, under our original agreement, until the cash
subscribers had received all their money back.&quot; AAcoA pg 188.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
But Wilson also wrote:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Meanwhile, some of the stockholders in the book company,Works Publishing,
began to get restive. All the book profits, they complained, were going for
A.A. work in the office. When, if ever, were they going to get their money
back? We also saw that the book &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; should now become
the property of A.A. as a whole. At the moment [1940], it was owned
one-third by the 49 subscribers, one-third by my friend Hank P., and the
remainder by me.
<p>
As a first step, we had the book company,Works Publishing, audited and
legally incorporated. Hank P. and I donated our shares in it to the
Alcoholic Foundation (as our board of trustees was then called). This was
the stock that we had taken for services rendered. But the 49 other
subscribers had put in real money. They would have to be paid in cash.Where
on earth could we get it?&quot;<br>

</blockquote>


<p>
<font color="blue">

</font>
<p>

How, if the shares were never issued, did Bill and Hank &quot;donate&quot; shares
that &quot;we had taken for services rendered&quot; to the Alcoholic Foundation? One
can't donate something that &quot;had never been issued and could not be
issued&quot;.
<p>
Also, Wilson states that the shares couldn't have been issued until &quot;the
cash subscribers had received all their money back&quot; in AAcoA. But in the
Service Manual Wilson states that he and Hank P. donated their shares to
the Alcoholic Foundation before the subscribers were paid back. What a mess
of lies and contradictions!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes.
</font>
<p>

Finally, in AAcoA Wilson writes:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;Ruth had no time to keep books, and I did not know how.&quot;<br>
</font>
AAcoA, pg. 188.
</blockquote>
<p>
How was Wilson, as a self proclaimed &quot;stockbroker&quot;(which we know he wasn't)
and business analyst who traveled the country evaluating companies, unable
to keep books? How did Wilson not know the basics of accounting? If Wilson
wasn't able to keep books then he wouldn't have known how to analyze or
evaluate them either? So, how did Wilson evaluate or analyze a company if
he couldn't analyze or evaluate their books? He must have been the suckiest
business analyst ever.
<p>
Or was he just trying to distance himself from the financial irregularities
by claiming that since he didn't know how to keep books and didn't keep the
books then he wasn't to blame for the missing money?

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, I think the later. I think that Bill Wilson was familiar enough with the laws of stocks to
know that he was also engaged in felony securities fraud.  He definitely wanted to distance
himself from that, and pretend that somebody else did it.

Hello again Terrance,
<p>
The threats of death to the alcoholic or AA member in AA literature are
alarming and disgusting. Why does AA have to threaten its members with
death? Here's a list that I've put together: some are direct and explicit,
some are implicit, some are subtle &#8212; all contain the same message: Do it
the AA way or die!
<p>
I've covered all of the Big Book except for the personal stories, the
12&amp;12, The AA Service Manual and the Traditions pamphlet.There are 56
examples in this list. I wonder how many death threats there are in total
in all AA literature?
<p>
Thanks

<li> 14 Faith
without works was dead, he said. And how appallingly true for the alcoholic!
<li> 15 If he did not work, he would surely drink again, and if he drank, he
would surely die.
<li>  16 Faith has to work twenty-four hours a day in and
through us, or we perish.
<li>   24 When this sort of thinking is fully
established in an individual with alcoholic tendencies, he has probably
placed himself beyond all human aid, and unless locked up, may die, or go
permanently insane.
<li>  25 ...if we had passed into the region from which
there is no return through human aid we had but two alternatives: One was
to go on to the bitter end ... and the other, to accept spiritual help.
<li>  30 The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the
great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion
is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.
<li> 44 To
be doomed to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are not
always easy alternatives to face.
<li> 62 Above everything, we alcoholics must
be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kills us!
<li>  66 ...this business
of resentment is infinitely grave. We found that it is fatal.
<li> 66 The
insanity of alcohol returns and we drink again. And with us, to drink is to
die.
<li>  66 In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had
power to actually kill.
<li> 70 We have listed and analyzed our resentments. We
have begun to comprehend their futility and their fatality.
<li> 75 He should
realize that we are engaged upon a life-and-death errand. [The 5th step is
a life and death errand]
<li> 92 Continue to speak of alcoholism as an illness,
a fatal malady.
<li>  96 To spend too much time on any one situation[prospective
member] is to deny some other alcoholic an opportunity to live and be happy.
<li> 103 A spirit of intolerance might repel alcoholics whose lives could
have been saved...
<li>  117 Never forget that resentment is a deadly hazard to an
alcoholic.
<li>  124 With it you can avert death and misery for them. [working
with another family]
<li>  142 Say that you believe that he is a gravely ill
person, with this qualification &#8212; being perhaps fatally ill...
<li> 150 They have
a new attitude, and they have been saved from a living death.
<li>  154 But
what about his responsibilities &#8212; his family and the men who would die
because they would not know how to get well, ah-yes, those other
alcoholics?
<li>  Appendix 1: To those now in its fold, Alcoholics Anonymous has made the difference
between misery and sobriety, and often the difference between life and
death.
<li>  Appendix 1: We alcoholics see that we must work together and hang
together, else most of us will finally die alone.
<li>  Appendix 1: A.A. must continue
to live or most of us will surely die.

<li> 23 ...our drinking even then was no mere habit, that it was indeed the
beginning of a fatal progression.
<li> 24 Under the lash of alcoholism, we are
driven to A.A., and there we discover the fatal nature of our situation.
<li> 30 We
saw that we had to reconsider or die.
<li> 31 In A.A. we saw the fruits of this
belief[in God]: men and women spared from alcohol's final catastrophe.
<li> 64 It
is plain for everybody to see that each sober A.A. member has been granted
a release from this very obstinate and potentially fatal obsession.
<li> 69 Delay
is dangerous, and rebellion may be fatal. [giving up character defects]
<li> 76 If
that degree of humility could enable us to find the grace by which such a
deadly obsession could be banished, then there must be hope of the same
result respecting any other problem we could possibly have.
<li> 108 We knew we
would have to quit the deadly business of living alone with our conflicts,
and in honesty confide these to God and another human being.s
<li>  130 His life
actually depends on obedience to spiritual principles. If he deviates too
far, the penalty is sure and swift; he sickens and dies.
<li> 131 Like us they
had suddenly found themselves saved from death...
<li> 141 At last experience
taught us that to take away any alcoholic's full chance was sometimes to
pronounce his death sentence,...
<li>  142 If we turn this man away, he'll soon
die.
<li> 151 For us, if we neglect those who are still sick, there is
unremitting danger to our own lives and sanity.
<li> 174 Unless each A.A.
member follows to the best of his ability our suggested Twelve Steps to
recovery, he almost certainly signs his own death warrant.
<li> 189 A.A. must
continue to live or most of us will surely die.

<li>  S1 We must carry the message, else we ourselves can
wither and those who haven't been given the truth may die.
<li> S13 A.A. must
continue to live or most of us will surely die.
<li> 8 We very well know that
the penalty for extensive disobedience to these principles is death for the
individual and dissolution for the group.
<li> 42 What the sponsor does and
says...can make all the difference, often the difference between life and
death.
<li> 73 If after a trial they cannot do better, we know they face a
choice: they can go mad or die or they can return to Alcoholics Anonymous.
<li> 75 We know that we personally have to choose conformity to A.A.'s Twelve
Steps and Twelve Traditions or else face dissolution and death, both as
individuals and as groups.

<li>  5 We know that Alcoholics
Anonymous must continue to live. Else, save few exceptions, we and our
brother alcoholics throughout the world will surely resume the hopeless
journey to oblivion.
<li> 6 A.A. must continue to live or most of us will
surely die.
<li>  12 He can join A.A. on the mere suspicion that he may be one
[an alcoholic], that he may already show the fatal symptoms of our malady.
<li> 32 Still it is a fact that most of us do follow, in our personal lives, the
Twelve Suggested Steps to recovery. But we do this from choice. We prefer
recovery to death.
<li>  43 A.A. is a power greater than any of us; it must go
on living or else uncounted thousands of our kind will surely die. This we
know.

Yes. Thanks for the lists. Nothing like a few death threats to keep the suckers in line.
