From:  	&quot;doc scott&quot; <br>
Subject:  	hello<br>

<p>

My name is Doc and I've been reading some of your stuff, especially
about AA and Bill Wilson, and most of what I read is true.  I was a
member off and on since 1980.  It appears that you may think &quot;born
again&quot; Christians may have a mental problem...of course that's what I
always thought until I heard the Bible preached with no appology.  God's
Holy Word introduced me to who He is and who Jesus is and from July 22,
1992 changed my everything.  The alcholism (bondage) I suffered with for
years which was killing my marriage was on again/off again in A.A.
God's truths in the bible about drunkeness set me free when I accepted
them and repented.  Drinking hasn't been an issue since Jan. 19, 1993.
You are quite a smart person with a lot of time on your hands to be able
to research so much history on Oxford, AA, Bill and Bob, beledona, etc.
Did you ever spend as much time reading God's Word and listening to His
Word preached?  I will try to find the time to read more of your site,
and I hope you will respond.
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Doc Scott
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Doc,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. Congratulations on your sobriety. I am happy for you
and your better life now.
<p>
Alas, you have it backwards about my attitude: I don't think that people who are
born-again Christians have mental problems. I think that a lot of people with mental
problems claim to be born-again Christians.
<p>
When somebody like Jimmy Carter says that he is a born-again Christian, I can believe and
respect that because he is one of the most moral and honest men on Earth.
And he spends his days doing things like the Habitat for Humanity and promoting peace and freedom.
He really deserved to win the Nobel Peace Prize. I am happy for him.

<p>
On the other hand,
<a href="orange-letters52.html#David_K">when a person who claims to be a born-again Christian
refuses to honestly answer a single question</a>,
and just repeatedly arrogantly declares that he understands the Bible better than I do,
while dodging more questions,
then I know that he did not go through any kind of a genuine death and rebirth experience.
And he didn't go through any kind of meaningful religious conversion either.

<p>
His &quot;spiritual experience&quot; was probably just a delusion, or
wishful thinking. Some revival
preachers are skilled in inducing such sham experiences.
<a href="orange-interpreted.html#Streiker_conversion">Look here</a> for a description
of the process.
The problem with such false experiences is that their effects wear off
quickly, and people are soon
back to their old bad habits, same as usual.

<p>
Far, far more people like to imagine that they are born-again, than really are.
<p>
Many will be called, but few will be chosen.
<p>
You shall know them by the fruit of their labors.
<p>
Have a good day.

Hey Orange,
<p>
Thanks for replying.  You would have been a great lawyer.  Trust me, I
came from a long line of them.  I read a little bit more of your
communications, and from what I gather you would definitely not qualify
as a &quot;born again&quot; Christian.  This is why bibically:  A Christian would
be convicted by the Holy Spirit to confess Jesus Christ to others (I am
not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto
salvation).
<p>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Doc,
<p>
That is incorrect. Read on and I'll explain why.
</font>
<p>


<p>
The stuff about Moses killing and such.  He's doing what
God says to do.  We don't always understand everything, but God's ways
are higher than our ways.  I think the people who are being captured or
killed were a long time rebellious to God, and He'd had enough.  There
demise would fit into his plan of an eventual peace for His chosen
people.  I wasn't aware that Moses was racist because didn't Moses marry
an Ethiopian woman, and his sister was stricken with leprosy for saying
something to him abo ut it?  I don't pretend to know everything, but I
believe have been tribes that God decided to eliminate.
<p>
<font color="blue">
That is quite an excuse for mass murder and rape &#8212; &quot;God told me to do it.&quot;
When a serial killer is hauled into court for murder, the judge does not accept
a defense of &quot;God told me to do it.&quot; Today, we lock such people up in prisons
for the criminally insane.
<p>
Heck, even Adolf Hitler claimed that God told him to do it:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator.
By warding off the Jews I am fighting for the Lord's work.<br>
</font>
== Adolph Hitler, Speech, Reichstag, 1936
</blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="#4f007f" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his
own denomination, of making people stop just talking superficially of
God's will, and actually fulfill God's will, and not let God's word be desecrated.
For God's will gave men their form, their essence and their abilities.
Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will.<br>
</font>

</blockquote>

<p>
What you are missing is the fact that we only have
the word of Moses the mass murderer that God told him to do it.<br>
I don't believe that God told him to do it.<br>
What Jesus said is, &quot;God loves you more than a mother loves her child.&quot;<br>
Jesus did not say, &quot;God hates you and will kill you by the hundreds of
thousands if you are the wrong religion or ethnic type.&quot;
<p>
What you are doing is contradicting what Jesus said, and making God into a cruel monster.
(I wonder how God feels about such an insult.)
<p>
Now you can choose to believe Moses if you wish. I choose to believe Jesus.
<p>
And yes, Moses was a racist, in spite of his having married an Ethiopian woman.
He still slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people just because they were
the wrong race &#8212; non-Jewish.
<p>
And Jesus never said that God decided to eliminate tribes because they were the wrong
religion or race.
<p>
What you are trying to do is rationalize away some of the worst of crimes &#8212; mass murder, genocide,
ethnic cleansing, religious bigotry, slavery, and rape of tens of thousands of virgins.
But the rules have not changed in the last 3000 or 4000 years. Murder is still murder.
<p>
And Moses even wrote a commandment against it &#8212; &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot;
Then Moses broke his own rule. I guess maybe Moses really meant,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Thou shalt not kill Jews.&quot;
</font>
<p>
That is racism.
<p>
If we the human race have learned anything in the last 4000 years, it is that conduct like
genocide and ethnic cleansing is not good.
But you want to wipe out the last 4000 years of progress
and return to moral standards where such murder is okay and
justifiable (if God tells you to do it).
</font>
<p>

<p>
You know, people these days don't like for anyone to tell them that they
are a sinner on their way to hell because God can't allow sin into his
presence.  They don't mind hearing that Jesus is a way, but they don't
like to hear that Jesus is the only Way, Truth, and Life.  No man comes
to the Father, but by Me.
<p>
Also I wouldn't sweat it when someone tells
you that you don't understand scripture because you're not born again.
I understood parts of it before, but it came to life after I was born
again.  Now do me a favor and explain your answer that you have found
peace.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Actually, you are misunderstanding that phrase, which is common among people who
have not had death and rebirth experiences. When you die, your ego disappears and
you cease to be the person whom you were before.<br>
Jesus announced that he would be leaving his disciples. They asked, &quot;Lord, we don't
know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"
(John 14:5)<br>
Jesus answered, <i>&quot;I am the way and
the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me
you would know my Father as well.&quot;</i>.<br>
He was speaking
as the Holy Spirit, not as Jesus. He was not so vain and shallow as to say,
&quot;Only through Jesus can you come to the Way and the Truth and the Life and the Father.&quot;
Jesus did not say that other religions could not also lead their followers to the Way and the Truth.
<p>
And that is why I don't spend my years trying to cram one particular
religion down the throats of unwilling victims.
</font>
<p>

<p>
Do you have One you will have to answer to? Or will you just try
to live well and die and be gone?
<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh yes, I am quite fine in the God department. Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself.
</font>
<p>

<p>
P.S.  I go to AA about once a year to
see how nasty it looks, how rough the people look, find out who all
died, and let them know I didn't slip for the last 13 years.
<p>
Thanks, Doc

<p>

Well good. Congratulations on your sobriety.

Subject:  	Re: hello<br>

<p>

I would have to beg to differ when Jesus said I am the way... He meant
he is the only way.  The Holy Spirit was waiting for His ascension in
heaven so the Holy Spirit could come down on Pentecost.  Apostle Paul
said if anyone else comes to you with any other gospel than the one I
have given you, then let them be acursed.  Since the Savior of the World
has already come, He is the Way, the only way.  If you'd think that
Jesus was one of many ways, what would be the point of Him dying on the
cross and raising from the dead (witnessed)?
<p>
Moses did what God told him to do, so God can take the blame.  But God
is God and if God wants to do another sodom explosion and vaporize New
Orleans and San Francisco, then that's God's choice.  God can't be how
you want him to be because you didn't create Him, and His ways are
higher than our ways.
<p>
Thanks, Doc<br>
Have a wonderful 4th (God Bless America)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Doc,
<p>
No, Moses did not do what God told him to do. God gave no such orders.<br>
The Father of Jesus Christ is not such a monster.<br>
Can't you see how you take the name of the Lord in vain?<br>
You really insult and defame God and make him as bad as the Devil.<br>
<p>
Your religion is really way off the deep end. You declare that mass murder,
genocide, ethnic cleansing, religious bigotry, and the rape of 32,000 innocent
virgin girls is okay because some psychopath hears voices in his head that tell
him that God says to do it?
<p>
That is not Christianity. Period.

<p>
What your religious beliefs remind me of is the TV show &quot;Stargate-SG1&quot;.
There, the &quot;gods&quot; are the <i>Goa'ould</i>, which are some very nasty worms who demand
that everybody bow before them, and worship them as gods, and be their obedient slaves,
or else they will kill the whole town, or the whole planet.
The similarity to the Old Testament tyrants, including the God of Moses, is
not a coincidence. If you saw the original movie, you would know that they patterned
the <i>Goa'ould</i> after the Egyptian Pharaohs.

<p>
You are deluded about God, and you are ignoring the teachings of Jesus:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
<b>
Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
ye have done it unto me.<br></b>
</font>
== Jesus, in Matthew 25:40
</blockquote>

<p>
Next, I suppose you will be telling me that Alcoholics Anonymous is a really great
religion that has a working cure for alcoholism.

<p>
You are also way off base about the Holy Ghost not being in Jesus until
after He died.
The Bible states pretty clearly that the Spirit entered into Jesus when
he was baptised by John the Baptist:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And Jesus, when he was baptised, went up straightway out of the water:
and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending
like a dove, and lighting upon him.<br>
And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.<br>
Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be temped of the devil.
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights...<br>
</font>
St. Matthew 3:16 to 4:1
</blockquote>

<p>
Likewise:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit
into the wilderness.
Being forty days tempted by the Devil. And in those forty days he did eat nothing.<br>
</font>
Luke 4:1
</blockquote>

<p>
And so on and so on...
<p>
Jesus constantly taught that you should not wait to make your spiritual progress.
Do it in this lifetime, now. Catch the Spirit now.
Ego loss now. The Kingdom of Heaven is within you &#8212; go to Heaven now.

<p>
Spirituality is not something that you get after you die.
If you think that you will get handed the goodies after you die, you just might
miss the boat, and find out that you are a day late.

Hi Orange,
<p>
In regards to Moses, you may think he was a mass murderer in his time, but God's
ways are (again) higher than our ways...  No comparison to Koresh or Jim Jones
because they are not in the Holy Bible.  I submit to you that if the world used this
book as their standard of living, we would not have the problems we have today.
If you just want to use one little piece of the Bible and run with it, then you have
a problem both in living practices and faith.  You were using today's judicial
system for judging Moses or anyone else.  First, God Himself would be the judge for
Moses (Prophet of the O.T.)  Our judicial system (reinterpreting the Const.) is so
screwed up, our educational system is so screwed up, even some the churches
(ex:Episcopal) are so screwed up because they are not living by the standards set
forth in the Bible.  Take God out of everthing is our worldly (Satanic) view, hence,
chaos.
<p>
I didn't catch a response when I questioned you about being &quot;born again.&quot;  How do
you get your peace from God, and if you don't trust Jesus to take you to Heaven when
you die, then how do you plan to get there?
<p>
Agape'<br>

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again Doc,
<p>
Focusing all of your energy on going to Heaven is enormously selfish.
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;To Hell with all of those other people, I got mine.&quot;</i>
</font>

<p>
That whole &quot;going to heaven&quot; routine is a big ego trap.
It's just another temptation.
What will you do to get a guaranteed ticket to heaven?
Will you be like Moses and kill everybody in the city?

<p>
Personally, I plan to go way beyond Heaven. Heaven is merely a stopping-over point
where you can get bored to death with playing a harp.

<p>
Now if they offered old Fender Stratocasters, I might be tempted...

<p>
But enough of this. The Orange Papers web site is about alcoholism, A.A., and recovery,
not debating the fine points of fundamentalist religions.
Although you have done a fine job of warning people about the kind of religion that
they might find in the next A.A. meeting.
I thank you for that.

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Dear Orange,
Let me just say that spirituality is not something that I'm waiting to get when I
die.  Real godly spirituality was what I was given the day I was &quot;born again.&quot;
Don't knock it till you've been there.  I'm not deluded about God or Jesus Christ
being the Only Begotten Son of God.  I won't challenge you in any way as this is
your domain, and it is about the agendas of AA, which I made it very clear I am not
in agreement with that program/cult.  I'd like to finish by saying I am thankful
there was a Jew named Moses who delivered the Israelites out of Egypt (a picture of
sin) and handed us the ten commandments, and I am thankful there was a Jew named
Jesus Christ (The Word) who delivered me (a sinner) from bondage into eternal life.

You are an idot! Ask anyone who actually works daily in the field of
Addiction if A.A works. Quote all of your so called facts you want. With
your logic there is only a 50-50 chance that someone will die of
addiction today. Either they will or they won't. Let me assure you they
will. The big book calls it contempt before investigation. If we can

Hello Buren,
<p>
The people who work at the treatment centers are the worst people to ask for the truth.
They have a vested interest in lying to continue the hoax. That is like asking a thief to

<p>
The statement that slightly more than 50% of the alcoholics will

Those are the results that the member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant</a> got when he used Alcoholics Anonymous
to treat alcoholics. For almost 20 years, Vaillant tried to prove that A.A. works good,
but in the end all that he proved was that A.A. does not work and that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. kills</a>.

<p>
When you say that
&quot;A.A. offers hope nothing more.&quot;, you are both repeating a
slogan, and saying that A.A. does not actually have a working

hope, but it fails to deliver on the promises.

As far as giving hope is concerned, I give lots of people hope by telling them that
they don't have to be a slave of the Alcoholics Anonyous cult for the rest of their lives

No place in any literature of Alcoholics Anonymous does the phrase &quot;you

Subject:  	Thanks mate<br>

<p>

Hello

<p>

I have been feeling that I must be mad.  I feel like I am the only one
who is admitting that the emperor has no clothes on if you catch my
drift.  I have been in AA for two years and I don't believe in God.  I
did a chair the other day to that effect and was criticised.  I started
to doubt myself.  Luckily I have the strength of mind to resist.  Some
don't.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Louise,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and thanks for the compliments.
</font>
<p>

Your site has helped me to get a better perspective away from the AA
propaganda and it's perpetuators.  I always had a feeling that the
teachings of AA were more than just suggestions.  A lot of those that I
hear in AA make it seem that they are requirements.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Correct. Coincidentally,
<a href="orange-letters56.html#Gwen">the letter than came in immediately before yours</a>
was about just that &#8212;
although the correspondent was denying that there are any &quot;musts&quot; in Alcoholics Anonymous.
That is nonsense. There are lots of them, including statements that you <i>Must</i> work
a strong program or else you will die.
</font>
<p>

I went silent and suffered.  I felt I could not share the AA line and so
was not allowed to share at all.  I didn't want to be judged and
criticised.  Now I feel that it might be my duty to.  I do, however,
feel that it will fall on deaf ears and be resisted.  Perhaps it would
be better to just leave.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Perhaps so.
</font>
<p>

But there is the lingering fear of exit from AA.  There are times when I
have felt that I needed it when going through rougher patches.  It
scares you into thinking that your life will fall apart if you leave.
Recently I have started attending Adult Children of Alcoholics and
although it has the 12 steps at it's core, it isn't as dogmatic and I
can actually talk about the underlying cause of my unhappiness and not
just &quot;the solution&quot;.  It seems that AA is saying that if you pray,
believe in God and learn how to regurgitate the right things and phrases
then you will be well.   I feel that there is a lot more to it than that.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Agreed &#8212; there is more to it. By the way, that lingering fear is normal &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias">A.A. routinely implants fears and phobias</a> in its members,
as do most cults. Cults keep their members in the organization by convincing
them that
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_phobias">something horrible will happen to them</a>
if they ever leave the cult.
</font>
<p>

Anyway, I have barely begun reading your site, so much there to take
in.  I thank you for opening up my world, getting me to see that I was
partially addicted to AA.  I may as well have been drunk.  It seems that
it helps for a while just to focus you off the drink but unless you are
prepared to go super religious after a while, and con your brain into
peace and serenity on a false premise, then AA isn't helpful.

<p>

It just teaches you to be an ignorant parrot....

<font color="blue">
I have occasionally suggested
<a href="orange-letters15.html#Frase2">to other people</a>
that they quit A.A. slowly,
kind of detox and go through the cult withdrawal slowly, so that they
can see that the sky isn't falling as they attend fewer and fewer
meetings. That also gives you time to build up a different social circle so that you 
are not just suddenly alone.

<p>
And you might be able to get some support and companionship from alternative groups.
There is a list of alternatives
<a href="orange-letters54.html#alt_list">here</a>, including Internet chat groups and message
boards.

Subject:  	More from the Wolf in the UK<br>

<p>
Hi Orange,

<p>
About three months without a meeting now and, what do you know, I have
not died, drunk or gone mad. I still want to write you the big E Mail of
my full story some time, but not now. I do think about some things more
than others when I remember my 15 years of continuous sobriety in AA.

<p>
&quot;AA is a bridge to normal living.&quot; What's normal about feeling obliged
on pain of death to pray morning and evening, to take continuous moral
inventory, attend meetings, be in service, help newcomers, etc.? It
never seemed very normal to me.

<p>
In AA we have a spiritual experience which stops us ever having to drink
again. Then why do people ask to be kept sober every morning? Why does
it wear off every night? What sort of omnipotent God heals you, but only
until you go to sleep. Even those who believe in faith healing don't
think it wears off while you are asleep! I am sure I originally read
this point on your site but I can't get over how I swallowed the baloney
for all those years.

<p>
&quot;You have to go to meetings to hear about what happens to people who
don't go to meetings.&quot; This suggests that only people who go to meetings
get drunk again. But I knew countless people over the years who relapsed
despite being regular attenders of meetings, some of them many, many
years sober. And I only heard about what had happened to people who had
stopped coming to meetings if it was bad, which was actually quite rare.

<p>
Maybe, like me, they're just too polite to come back and say, &quot;Actually
guys, it's fine out here.&quot; Why did I as a true believing Stepper so
readily swallow the idea that anyone who disappeared from meetings had
drunk again and/or gone mad and/or died? Cult brainwashing, that's why.
<p>
And, if I did not mention it in my first E Mail, loads of people
claiming to be sober in AA, here in the UK anyway, are using drugs,
prescription or illegal. Some even share openly about it in meetings.
The person who ripped me off was even elected secretary of a group weeks
after coming back from a spell smoking dope. It got too complicated
trying to work out who really needed medication and who was just too
soft to work the Steps and take the pain. Now I am no longer a Stepper I
can see how many people with undiagnosed mental illnesses getting no
help from the steps were probably right to take the medication. They
weren't soft. They were being tricked. How I took the pain myself, I
will never know.
<p>
AA is meant to be about getting rid of ego but the most prominent group
members were often highly egotistical. They had their way of doing the
steps (often denying the usefulness of any literature apart from pages
1-164 of the Big Book) and usually shared in a powerful and dramatic way
in meetings. Sometimes they were feuding with each other, trying to be
the most sober person in that group or even area. Looking back, it is
funny, competing to be top of the sobriety tree. I flipped out once
because someone from the UK GSO in York was given a privileged place in
a meeting and treated like a celebrity. But then, in time, I fell into
the AA way of thinking and
looked in AA for things like respect, status, responsibility, that I
should have been looking for in my career and the community.

<p>
When I was living with my last girlfriend before I met my wife and got
married, I took her to a meeting to bring us closer together. She sat
there with tears rolling down her cheeks and we eventually broke up. Now
I think I know why she was crying. At the time, I just looked down on
her for not realizing how wonderful we AAs were.

<p>
Keep up the good work. My baby son loves ducks too and now says &quot;quack,
quack&quot; to them. You guys must have something in common.

<p>
The Wolf

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again Wolf,
<p>
Wow. Thanks for a moving letter. The girlfriend crying in the meeting really hits right
in the gut.
So sad, and so true.
<p>
Oh, and congratulations on your newfound freedom.
<p>
Have a good day, and a good life. And it's too bad your son can't see the little geese here.
They are just so cute.

I to was sent to AA through the courts and after running from AA like
YOU did I returned and followed the steps with help from a sponsor.  I
am currently sober for almost 9 months and I believe if I can stay
spiritually fit I will remain this way for life.  I have seen people go
in and out of AA this is true but a core group always stays without whom
AA would die off but it grows and has remained since 1939. Anyone can
attend a open meeting how about leaving it up to the people to attend
and they can  judge for themselves.

Hello Bob,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your 9 months of sobriety.
<p>
You are repeating an untrue stereotype of &quot;The Alcoholic&quot; in your title line.
There is no such thing as &quot;the standard alcoholic&quot; who is driven
to go to great lengths to prove something.
That is just more of the standard A.A. indoctrination.
See the file on
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html">The <i>Us Stupid Drunks</i> Conspiracy</a>
for more of that same stereotype.
<p>
So you now have 9 months of being indoctrinated into Alcoholics Anonymous, and you have become
a true believer. I won't even bother to mention how many years I have been sober. I will just
point you to
<a href="orange-letters56.html#Wolf">the letter that just came in</a>
immediately before yours, from a fellow who has
15 years of continuous sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous,
and he says that it is a cult and he is quitting it.
<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	OMG<br>

<p>

Wow, read a lot on your web site.

<p>

There's really NOTHING I disagree with.

<p>

I am a physician with no history of drug abuse other
than a short period of &quot;self medicating&quot; after the
loss of my wife to cancer.

<p>

Without going into details, I took this loss very hard
and made a poor decision etc....

<p>

I self reported the &quot;self medicating&quot; to the local
diversion board.....

<p>

BAM!!! &#8212; I screwed myself

<p>

The medical diversion boards are nothing but AA cult
recruiters with considerable power.

<p>

Want to keep your license?? DO EXACTLY WHAT WE SAY and
swallow the AA religion COMPLETELY.

<p>

These diversion boards are also in bed with several
treatment centers.... unbelieveable!

<p>

When I was at my lowest they almost recruited me...

<p>

As I gained my strength I decided not to become a
BRAIN DEAD IDIOT and moved rapidly away from the CULT.

<p>

But here's the rub &#8212; I want to keep my license &#8212; so I
LIE to the board that I am accepting their religion.

<p>

I tried to be honest with them and told them that
several things were not sitting well with me......

<p>

........ I got assigned more mandatory meetings and
more service work.   WTF &#8212; honesty my ass

<p>

As if random UA's are not enough I gotta swallow this
CRAP for several more years.

<p>

I am going to seek legal advice.

<p>

By the way:<br>
I have recovered from my &quot;problem&quot; I am NOT in recovery<br>
I am NOT powerless<br>
I am NOT an addict<br>
I am NOT chemically dependent<br>

<p>

The AA cult is shear LUNACY

A state-enforced cult religion that sells quackery is so blatantly illegal and unConstitutional
that it is almost beyond belief &#8212; and yet it is the reality that we have now.
<p>
It is a shame that
<a href="orange-letters13.html#ER">
the popular TV show <i>ER</i> glossed over all of those issues</a> when
Dr. Carter had his pill problem. They acted like
&quot;go to a meeting&quot; was the answer to Dr. Carter's
drug problem, and Nurse Abby's alcohol problem too.
They implied that the &quot;diversion program&quot; that Carter went into
was a good thing &#8212; and that it really worked.

<p>
That is quackery, pure quackery, no more scientific or medical than
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html">selling snake oil elixirs</a>.
I can only guess that some more hidden Stepper propagandists are on the staff of writers for the show.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway. And as far as support goes, donations never hurt.
There is always something to fix. Thanks.

Subject:  	Re: OMG<br>

<p>

Many, many thanks for all the work you have done.

<p>

I am still dealing with the utter madness surrounding
my situation.

<p>

I plan on writing you an update to add to your web
page letters.

<p>

I am curious if you can help me with this:

<p>

I need to find as many sound articles and research re:
(in)effectivness of AA etc....

<p>

I want to collect anything I can find and do my best
to get out of the mandated AA cult religion.

<p>

As you state, the truth cannot be denied. And I am up
against some of the strongest, most devout cult
members there are.

<p>

Not only do they hold the license's of many
physicians, they continue to send them straight to
Hazelden &#8212; ALL OF THEM. (possibly some other 12 step
indoctrination facility)

<p>

... turns my stomach

<p>

I have sooooo much to say on this subject that I
decided to start a book on my experience. Intended to
be therapuetic, but I hope to share with others
someday.

<p>

Any help would be appreciated. I realize that you
reference several papers, but do you have them
organized in attachment you might send me?

<p>

Also which books might be good for my &quot;defense&quot;?

<p>

Any &#8212; any &#8212; help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>

I use this metaphor at times in reference to my
situation:

<p>

Let's say I went to prison. I could make things much
easier on myself if I just stop struggling and let
Bubba sodomize me...... but I'd rather fight and die
trying.

<p>

I am actually serious about that. I am willing to lose
my license over accepting this brain dead cult.

<p>

That really would be a shame. And what would they have to say?<br>
&quot;He just couldn't get the program&quot;<br>
&quot;He was just an angry man&quot;<br>
&quot;He couldn't handle being around drugs again so he decided not to practice&quot;<br>
&quot;It was his choice, it's a simple program for those who can...&quot;<br>

<p>

What a bunch of BS.<br>
I joke with my friends that the #1 reason I stay sober is out of spite for the AA cult.

<p>

I am going on and on, sorry, but I DO get angry at
this new parasite on my back.

<p>

BTW I read your pages every day. It helps me deal with
these lunatics.

<p>

I do find it astounding when they perform right on cue
using all the various cult tactics, propaganda and
debating techniques when confronted even the tiniest
bit.

<p>

I hope to share those with you soon. You will get a
kick out of it especially seeing that these are full
blown phsychiatrists.... unbelievable..... the brain
washing is insidious and runs so friggin deep.

<p>

Be well, hope to hear from you soon.

website and had the biggest laughs of my life OMG so

Hi again, 
<p>
Yes, I have some stuff. See the file on
&quot;<a href="orange-effectiveness.html">The Effectiveness
of the 12-Step Treatment</a>&quot;, which contains listings of all of the valid
randomized longitudinal controlled studies of A.A. ever done.  Particularly see:
<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">Dr. Brandsma</a> found that
A.A. increased the rate of binge drinking in alcoholics.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman">Dr. Ditman</a> found that A.A.
increased the rate of rearrests for public drunkenness.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Walsh">Dr. Walsh</a> found that
&quot;free A.A.&quot; made later hospitalization more expensive.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford">Doctors Orford and Edwards</a>
found that having a doctor talk to the patient for just one hour,
telling him to quit drinking, was just as effective as a whole year of
A.A.-based treatment.
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant">Dr. George E. Vaillant</a>, who later
became a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and a member of the Alcoholics
Anonymous Board of Trustees, found that A.A. treatment was completely ineffective and
just raised the death rate in alcoholics.
</ol>

<p>
I have xeroxed copies of just about all of those articles. I can scan them into
my computer and email them to you.

<p>
For legal decisions, see
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges">this short summary, here</a>.<br>
For the actual decisions, see Ken Ragge's web site. He has a bunch of files, here:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html">
http://www.morerevealed.com/courts/index.html</a> &#8212; Archive of documents, including the legal
decisions that declared that A.A. was engaging in religious ceremonies,
and that sentencing someone to go to A.A. meetings was unconstitutional.

<p>
Have a good day, and good luck. Oh, by the way, I also stay sober because I'll be damned
if I'm going to give the A.A. nuts the satisfaction of me relapsing. Hell will freeze over
first.

Subject:  	More Crazy Spiritual Dogma<br>

<p>
Read this page and see how it tries to suck the reader in like the big book

<p>
My thoughts; God this sounds like bill willson's bullshit.

<p>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar">
http://www.kabbalah.com/k/index.php/p=zohar</a>

<p>
Bait and Switch, irrelevant concusion, sly suggestion, abstract
meaning... just like AA. The zohar comes from kabballa styles. The big
book resembles kabballa style diversions. Same style, used slander
Christ and divert from Hebrew teaching by using God name to gain
confidence in the reader.

<p>

Hmmm, 12 steps, 12 months in a year. What do we do on the 12th month of
the year?

<p>

12th Step

<p>

I swear to pass the message of recovery as a result of my spiritual
experience to the addict in recovery.

<p>

12 month

<p>

On the 12 month of the year I pass the message of Christ to my brothers
and celebrate the Holy Spirit.

<p>

Get my point?

<p>

This stuff makes me pretty ill.

<p>

Have a great day,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. I was not aware of the parallels there.
Somehow, I am not surprised though.
When I started
<a href="orange-cult.html">studying cults</a>,
I noticed that there were a lot of common threads that ran through all of
them. You just mentioned several of them.
<p>
And I noticed another: &quot;<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_dogma">Sacred Science</a>&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Kabbalah was and continues to be the original technology of life. It's the science of the soul
and the physics (and metaphysics) of fulfillment.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.kabbalah.com/courses/course_signup.html">
http://www.kabbalah.com/courses/course_signup.html</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Cults constantly misuse the words &quot;science&quot; and &quot;technology&quot;.
Religious doctrines are actually the exact opposite of science. Science is a process of learning
what the truth is by observing reality and seeing what is really happening in front of your face,
and then testing your ideas with experiments to
see if they are really true.
People who pore over ancient scrolls, &quot;seeking to find the secrets of the
universe&quot;, don't do that.
<p>
And then there is:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Suppose there was a universal wisdom, one singular seed that was the
origin of all teachings &#8212; a body of knowledge that could reveal the
spiritual and physical laws that govern the entire cosmos. What if it
could account for and explain every emotion and desire that stirs within
you? Suppose it could clarify and resolve all the problems that burden
you at this very moment?
<p>
What if it could explain all the eruptions that occur in our universe
the birth of a new star exploding into existence... to the explosive
arguments that erupt in your life?<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.kabbalah.com/sk101/01b.html">
http://www.kabbalah.com/sk101/01b.html</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is, of course, the cult characteristic
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_panacea">We have the Panacea</a>&quot;,
put forward with the propaganda trick of
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#suggestions">Sly Suggestions</a>&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;What if we have the answer to the universe?&quot;</font>
(Well, what if you don't?)

<p>
But this is the best so far:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
Impressive statements.<br>
But don't believe it for a second.<br>
Not one word. &nbsp; ...<br>
<p>
BELIEF WON'T CUT IT &nbsp; ... &nbsp; SO TEST EVERYTHING THAT YOU LEARN. EVERYTHING.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.kabbalah.com/sk101/02.html">
http://www.kabbalah.com/sk101/02.html</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
And that is called
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial">Reversal of Reality</a>&quot;,
another common cult characteristic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,New Century Schoolbook,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif">
SCIENCE, NOT SORCERY<br>
Is Kabbalah mysticism?<br>
Hardly. What was once considered mysticism is now called science.
As the renowned writer Arthur C. Clarke put it, Any sufficiently advanced
technology is indistinguishable from magic.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.kabbalah.com/sk101/03.html">
http://www.kabbalah.com/sk101/03.html</a>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, they misuse the word science, and make a patently false statement:
<font color="#4f007f">
<i>&quot;What was once considered mysticism is now called science.&quot;</i>
</font>
That isn't true at all.
<p>
Now Arthur C. Clarke's statement is true, but he was talking about modern astronauts showing
their instruments and tools to primitive natives who could not begin to comprehend electricity,
transistors, and microcomputers.

<p>
And it goes on and on. It just goes to show that P. T. Barnum was right:
&quot;There's a sucker born every minute.&quot;

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Okay Michael,
<p>
More homework and things to check out.
<p>
An interesting parallel question is,
&quot;What else did Frank Buchman take from occult sources, besides the idea that you can
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance">conduct a s&eacute;ance and
hear the Voice of God</a> sending you messages which you should
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#automatic_writing">then write down</a>.&quot;
(Ideas which Bill Wilson then copied...)
<p>
We know that Oxford Groupers were into contacting the spirits of the dead.
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Sinclair_2">Their occult contacts were not
limited to just God and Jesus</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Your reading list<br>

<p>

Hi,
I was just glancing through your reading list. First, thanks for listing most of
the See Sharp alcohol-related books.

<p>

Regarding your list of books on cults, I noticed that you listed the Olin book
on Synanon. It greatly downplays the negative aspects of that cult, and is
really a pretty lousy book. A much more informed insider's view &#8212; and the real
dirt &#8212; can be found in &quot;Paradise Incorporated: Synanon,&quot; by David U. Gerstel
(Novato, CA: Presidio Press, 1982), which as a bonus is much better written
than the Olin book.

<p>

Best regards,<br>
Chaz

<p>

P.S. I think the above bibliographical info is correct, but I don't have the
book immediately at hand.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Chaz,
<p>
It's a pleasure to hear from you. You had a big influence on my life, you know.
As I said in
<a href="orange-intro.html">the introduction to my web site</a>,
I found your book <i>A.A.: Cult or Cure?</i>
in the library and devoured it. It blew away a lot of my illusions about
Alcoholics Anonymous. It was like the straw that broke the camel's back.
Or, as I said in the introduction, &quot;The dam burst, and a giant wall
of water swept across the landscape.&quot; (The mental landscape, that is.)
<p>
So thank you.
<p>
About William Olin, yes, I know that his book is flawed, and occasionally biased,
and not a complete history of Synanon.
And he downplayed some of the horrors of Synanon.
But oddly enough, I find that to also be one of its charms. It's like the impact of
understatement. That is, Olin tried so
hard to be a good cult member. He gave Synanon 10 years of his life, and his life 
savings, and he worked as an architect for something like $25 per week for 10 years
to help Synanon.
He really believed in it, and then he really tried hard to continue to believe in
it. So his final disillusionment and departure were all the more moving and striking.
I quoted his exit story at length,
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#Olins_exit">here</a>.
<p>
And he did, in the end, find a number of the common characteristics of cults in Synanon.
<p>
Still, I'm interested in the book you mentioned. I'll check it out.
<p>
Oh, about the See Sharp books: I've listed all of the books that I've been able to read.
The ones that are not listed are the ones that I don't know about.
The ones that I have read are listed both in the bibliography and in my
&quot;<a href="orange-top10.html">Top 10</a>&quot; list,
which really numbers more like 20.

<p>
Thanks again for your pioneering work. And have a good day.

<p>

Dear Orange:

<p>

You know, I can't disagree with a single thing you say, yet I still have
this &quot;gut feeling&quot;, against all logic, that A.A. can work.  Wonder why
that is?  Why this aura about A.A. among the general public?  I can't
help but think that part of it is due to the way it is portrayed in
films and TV. i.e. always very favorably.  One of the best works about
alcoholism is &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, both the original 1958
teleplay and the 1962 motion picture.  And it is one big advertisement
for A.A.  One leading film critic (I forget which one) complained that
is was &quot;too reverant about A.A.&quot;

<p>

Just wondering,<br>
Jim H.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Jim,
<p>
I think you understand the situation. Alcoholics Anonymous has
<a href="orange-spirrecov.html">an incredible propaganda mill</a>
the keeps up a constant drum-beat of proclamations that &quot;It Works!&quot;
We are only human. It's hard to not be influenced by it after a while.
<p>
And you are right about <i>The Days of Wine and Roses</i>. Although the thing that really
got me was the end of the movie. When the wife declared, &quot;I just can't be that spiritual&quot;,
her husband just lets her walk out to her death. He doesn't even try to stop her or save
her. Say what??!

<p>
What kind of &quot;unconditional love&quot; was that?
<p>
What was he doing, letting her go &quot;for the sake of his own sobriety&quot;?
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Subject:<br>

<p>

Dear Orange:

<p>

I think that any person afflicted with substance abuse is in charge of
his/her own healing process.
<p>
No one else is in charge &#8212;  &quot;human beings are moral agents who make
choices&quot;.

<p>

That does not mean that the long uphill walk is done with travelling
companions.  You are not alone &#8212; unless you want to be.

<p>

I reject &quot;recovery&quot;.  The term has been contaminated with contingency by
the &quot;recovery industry&quot;.

<p>

If one needs to put an end to substance abuse, one does so.  Now and
forever.  The human being &#8212; a moral agent &#8212; takes that decision.
Having done that, one may begin to address issues.

<p>

Does 12 step speak to those issues?   Not for me.   Now, I must ask, Am
I alone in that?   I think not.

<p>

Is there any organization or person to travel with on this journey of
healing?   Yes.
<p>
Is one alone? No.

<p>

Orange, you have laid out many of the options available.

<p>

For myself, my alcohol abuse had a start point.  I decided &#8212; with
premeditation and malice aforethought &#8212; to get drunk.  Every night.
Unfortunately &#8212; or fortunately [ the issue is in doubt ] I did not
drink a enough wine to achieve a fatal case of alcoholic poisoning.  I
did not drink for &quot;fun&quot;.  Also, I did not fall down the stairs and break
my neck.

<p>

Why did I stop?    I decided to stop.   I found that I had reasons to
live.  So, a stop point.

<p>

So, I can describe when the abuse began; I can describe when it ended.

<p>

IMHO, this begs two questions:

<p>

To whom does AA speak?

<p>

To which questions does AA purport to answer?

<p>

The world wants to know.

<p>

For myself &#8212; I have put my life &#8212; which came to an end one black day [
1 Feb 2004] &#8212; back together.  I am as happy as I have made up my mind
to be.

<p>

Does AA speak to me?  No.

<p>

I must say good things about SMART Recovery.  The tools were good &#8212;
safe and effective &#8212;  and the folks online were very kind and thoughtful.

<p>

I found AA to be pathological and driven by dogma.

Hi again Howard,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and I couldn't agree more. My story is just the same.
The doctor said, &quot;Quit drinking or die. Choose one.&quot;
I thought it over for a month, and drank on it, and thought it over some more,
and then finally decided that I would rather live.
I just didn't want to die that way. (And then I quit smoking 3 weeks later for
the same reason. I was just sick and tired of being so sick and tired.)

<p>
I think that is what really happens with a lot of us. A.A. just fools some recovering
people into thinking that A.A. *made* them quit,
or that the 12 Steps somehow caused them to quit,
which is not true at all.
<p>
Oh well, have a good day and a great life.
<p>

From:  	&quot;Penelope&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Re: hi orange<br>

<p>

Orange, you certainly have conviction, I'll give you that!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, Penelope,
<p>
I not only have conviction, I have facts. They count for a lot more.
</font>
<p>

I do feel the program helps me stay clean from the dope &#8212; I was not able
to do it without the help of NA, and today I can. For me, it has worked
so far.

<p>
<font color="blue">
But feelings are not facts. Isn't there an A.A. slogan about that?
<p>
And <i>&quot;IT&quot;</i> has not worked for you. You are
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#correlation">assuming a cause-and-effect relationship</a>
where there is no evidence of any such causation.
People quit drinking because they get sick and tired of being sick and tired, not
because they join a cult religion.
<p>
To say that you couldn't &quot;do it&quot; before N.A., so that shows that N.A.
&quot;helped you&quot; to succeed, is an illogical statement.<br>

It's like saying that when you were a child,
you could never ride a bicycle &#8212; you always fell down &#8212; until
you tried out Billy's bright red bicycle, and you succeeding in riding that one.
So shiny red bicycles are the cure for &quot;bicycleism&quot; &#8212;
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Hey, I was never able to ride a bicycle before.
I was <b>powerless</b> over bicycles.
I fell down every time I tried.
But with Billy's bicycle, I succeeded,
and I don't fall down any more. That is proof that Billy's bicycle is magical and really
works.&quot;
</i></font>

<p>
Quitting dope or drinking is a learning process. (Just like learning to ride a bicycle.)
You have to learn that you really,
<i>REALLY</i> want to quit and permanently change your lifestyle. Until then, you will backslide.
Once you learn beyond a shadow of a doubt that dope and drink
are killing you, and you <i>really</i> decide to quit them
and live a healthier lifestyle, it is easy.
That process has nothing to do with any 12-Step organization, or Bill Wilson's religion,
or endless meetings,
or Buchmanism, or listing and confessing your sins and wallowing in guilt,
or any of that malarkey.
</font>
<p>

I respect your position &#8212; I'm sorry that others feel they need to cram
the 12 step philosophy down your throat &#8212; &quot;Attraction, not promotion&quot; as
we say. There is nothing attractive about choking on someone's opinion
or way of life, that's for sure!

<p>
<font color="blue">
It isn't just forcing the 12-Step cult religion on other people, although that is a big
part of it. Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12-Step program are
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma">inherently harmful</a>
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">raise the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
They even
<a href="orange-letters32.html#suicide_list" target="_blank">drive some alcoholics to suicide</a>.
</font>
<p>

OK &#8212; I am off to go do an H&amp;I presentation to the folks at the
county outpatient treatment clinic, ironically, so I'm gonna keep this
one short.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I don't know what an &quot;H&amp;I presentation&quot; is.
Should I assume that you are promoting Alcoholics Anonymous and
Narcotics Anonymous by giving the clinic false success statistics or
false claims of success?
Just what success rate do you tell them? Do you also mention
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Zimberg">the normal 5% per year rate of
spontaneous remission in alcoholics</a>?
</font>
<p>

YOU have a good day, OK?  I'll try to do the same!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, you have a good day too.

From:  	&quot;Mike B.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	fun with numbers<br>

<p>

Hey,
<p>
I have just noticed something interesting which I don't recall ever
having seen mentioned anywhere before. At
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.midlandaa.org/">www.midlandaa.org</a>
they list membership history, book sales, and
book royalties according to aaws over the years. [Starting at page 53.]
It is at the end of
their history pages.  Anyhow, pick a year, any year, say &#8212; 1994.  That
year, aa reported a US membership of 1,127,471 people.  That same
year, they reported big book sales totalling 1,049,343 copies.  Assuming
(very generously) each new and returning member that year ponied up
their cash and bought a brand new big book and that every remaining
member also bought one, we divide 1,127,471 people by 1,049,343 books
and then multiply that number by 12 months, we see that aa experiences a
100% turnover in membership every 12.89 months, based on my
unrealistically generous model.
<p>
Just one more proof-positive that aa works &#8212; if selling books and
making money constitutes success.
<p>
Something else I have considered:  If you are in the sheep business
and 95% of your sheep can't eat what you feed them and walk away, do
you:
<ul>
<li> a) blame the sheep?
<li> b) feed them something else?
<li> c) wonder why you are in the sheep business?
<li> d) don't change a thing because the government and society just keep sending you fresh sheep?
</ul>

<p>

Hi. Thanks for your recent letter. I've been putting together my reply

I've been poking through the history index page and can't find it.
I have downloaded the entire web site, for archiving, so hopefully the

Can you give me an exact URL for the actual web page where that stuff

<p>

Sorry 'bout that.  The full address is:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.midlandaa.org/AAhistory/AA_Timeline_2004-04-01_Public%2004.pdf">
http://www.midlandaa.org/AA_Timeline_2004-04-01_Public%2004.pdf</a>.
<p>
It starts with the year-by-year stuff down around page 52.  If you have
never seen the big book sales figures for recent years, you will be
pretty much floored by the sheer numbers.  Looking at those sales numbers,
it becomes abundantly clear why it is in AAWS absolutely refuses to turn
AA into something that could actually help people seeking recovery from
alcoholism.  It is in their financial self-interest to keep the ineffective
dinosaur propped up as-is with people continually ordered in, buying their
books, putting a few bucks in the basket, and then moving on.  A fresh
crop is right behind them and it wouldn't pay to have large numbers of
people recovering, taking up floor-space while we still have millions
of books to print and sell with a limitless supply of court slips to get
signed.  When all the patients get well and take the cure to the masses,
the hospital will have outlived its purpose.  Keep them sick, and keep
them coming back.
<p>
Keep up the good work.  Your efforts are shaking them up.


<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Mike,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. I didn't know about that web site. But I do now, and I am checking
out what they have.
<p>
The <i>Big Book</i> sales figures are very strange, aren't they? It looks like every
member buys a new copy of the book every year. Or else they have a heck of a lot of
newcomers buying a book and then walking out.
Or else the old-timer sponsors are buying a lot of copies for their sponsees, who then quit.

<p>
I find it curious that from 1987 to 1995, they sold over 1 million copies of the <i>Big Book</i>
per year, and then in 1996 it suddenly dropped to below a million, and declined for years
(pages 54-55).
It looks like the new edition may have been intended to boost sales of the book, because
that's what happened. Sales shot up from 899,000 in 2000 to 1,356,000 in 2001.
Everybody had to go out and buy a new copy of the book, since the old one was now obsolete.

<p>
Oh, and do you know what is really chilling? At the bottom of those pages, it says,
&quot;Public Version&quot;. The whole file is
&quot;A Narrative Timeline of A.A. History, Public Version&quot;.
<p>
Wow. Most cults hide the fact that they have
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_levels_of_truth">two versions of the truth</a>
&#8212; the sanitized white-washed happy-face public version that they tell to just anybody,
and the secret insiders' real truth that is revealed only to the innermost circle of
highest-ranking old-timers.
But A.A. openly labels their released documents &quot;Public Version&quot;.
<p>
Wouldn't you love to get into the locked and sealed secret A.A. archives
and get the real truth version?

<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

From:  	&quot;Joe C.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	nice site...<br>

<p>

Enjoyed some of the history about AA and its founders?

<p>

I have been going to AA for 4 years, and the good thing about it for me
was that I took a better look at myself. Don't know if I needed AA for
that but it helped.

<p>

I enjoy the meetings and the fellowships.

<p>

And I got a whole new concept of a higher power &#8212; I call mine life.

<p>

Thanks again for putting out another side of the story.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi Joe,
<p>
Thanks for the thanks, and thanks for the compliments.
<p>
I agree that introspection and fellowship are good things, but I am sure that
there are much better ways to get them than in Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
There are many other not-so-good things that come along with the
fellowship and introspection, in a sort of unexplained package deal.
Some people are even driven to suicide by the constant
guilt induction and their sponsors telling them to stop taking
their doctor-prescribed medications.
Remember that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths">A.A. actually
raises the death rate in alcoholics</a>.
<p>
You were lucky. Others were not.
<p>
You might like to check out some
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161103222256/http://www.smartrecovery.org/">SMART</a>
meetings. You will also find fellowship and techniques for self-examination
and introspection there, without the cult religion and crazy dogma.
<p>
Have a good day.
