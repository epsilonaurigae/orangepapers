Chapter 4:<br>
The Cult Characteristics of the Oxford Groups
</font>
</center>
<p><br><br>

Frank Buchman and his Oxford Groups and MRA displayed many of the characteristics that are
common to cults &#8212; any cults, religious or otherwise.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Frank_always_right" target="_blank">We have already touched on the first</a> &#8212;
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_guru_right" target="_blank">the Guru is always right</a>.
No matter what the leader says or how crazy it sounds, the leader is always right.
Nobody dares to contradict or criticize the leader. It just isn't done.
<p>
We have also already seen some more:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The cult claims that
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way" target="_blank">they have <i>the only way</i></a>
&#8212; the only way to Heaven, or to salvation, or spirituality, or eternal
bliss, or higher knowledge, or sanity, or mental powers, or recovery,
or
<a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_promises" target="_blank">whatever it is that
the cult promises to deliver</a>...

<p> <li>
And then there is
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_denigrate_others" target="_blank">Denigration of competing
sects, cults, or religions</a>.
A corollary to cults' claims of having <i>The Only Way</i> is the assertion that
&quot;the other people&quot; do not have <i>The Way</i>. &quot;They&quot; are
all misguided and missing the boat, and &quot;they&quot; won't be going to Heaven.
<p> <li>
Thus the cult encourages an
isolationist &quot;us versus them&quot; mindset, which naturally segues into
an attitude that...
<p> <li>
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">The cult members are
special</a> &#8212; they are morally and spiritually superior to the common
rabble who haven't been &quot;saved&quot; and who don't have <i>The Big
Answer</i>.

<p> <li>
Another common cult characteristic the we have seen is the demand for
<i><a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_surrender2cult" target="_blank">Surrender to the Cult</a></i>.
You can't just join the group; you have to surrender to the cult and give
it everything &#8212; your life, your mind, your heart, your loyalty,
your obedience, and even your soul.
(And 
<a href="orange-rroot210.html" target="_blank">all of your money</a> will be welcome too.)
<p>
An Oxford theologian observed that the students who became involved with Buchmanism
were obsessed with it:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Groupers are unable to give their heart and soul to any other
organization whatever: for his heart and soul is given to the group,
whose sole immediate task is to attack sin.<br>

</blockquote>


<p> <li> Then there are the constant put-downs &#8212; the cult characteristic of
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_you_wrong" target="_blank"><i>You Are Always Wrong</i></a>:
&quot;You have been defeated by sin&quot;,
&quot;You are so sinful that you are insane&quot;, and
&quot;You are hiding some giant sin that keeps you separated from God&quot;.

<p> <li> The constant put-downs also reveal the mind-bending technique of
<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_induce_guilt" target="_blank">Guilt Induction, and the
use of guilt to manipulate cult members</a>.

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_channelling" target="_blank">Channeled or occult sources of &quot;wisdom&quot;</a>,
like &quot;Guidance&quot; psychically received during a &quot;Quiet Time&quot;, is common in cult religions.

<p> <li> 
A <a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_authoritarian" target="_blank">hierarchical, authoritarian
system of control of members</a> is very typical of cults.<br>

<p> <li>
So is
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_authoritarian" target="_blank">Pseudo-democracy</a>.
The Oxford Groups supposedly offered people
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#true_democracy" target="_blank">true democracy</a>&quot;, where
nobody voted and everybody followed orders without question. Curiously,
Frank Buchman simultaneously declared that he was giving people
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot300.html#true_dictatorship" target="_blank">the true dictatorship of the living God</a>&quot;,
and &quot;<a href="orange-rroot480.html#theocratic_dictatorship" target="_blank">the dictatorship of the spirit of God</a>&quot;.
It takes some fancy semantic tap-dancing to reconcile &quot;true democracy&quot;
and &quot;true dictatorship&quot;.

<p> <li> 
The doctrine that
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_dont_trust_mind" target="_blank">you cannot trust your
own mind or your own thoughts</a>,
and must turn to the cult's mentors or elders for guidance is
another standard cult practice.
<p>
<li> And thus, so is
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_mentoring" target="_blank">a system of mentors</a>.

<p> <li> As is
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_intrusiveness" target="_blank">Intrusiveness</a> &#8212; they want to
hear about every sin you ever committed, and they claim the right to tell you
how to live, what to do, and what to believe.
<p> <li> 
And so is the attitude that
<a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_newcomers_wrong" target="_blank">newcomers can't think right</a>.<br>
<p> <li> 
And so is
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_denial" target="_blank">
the deceit that &quot;we have no structure or system&quot;</a>, when in fact
they have a very despotic system of control.

<p> <li> And then there is
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_deceptive_recruiting" target="_blank">Deceptive Recruiting</a>.

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_end_justifies" target="_blank">The End Justifies The Means</a>.

<p> <li> And
<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_beliefs_conform" target="_blank">You must change your
beliefs to conform to the group's beliefs.</a>

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q4.html#cq_thought_stop" target="_blank">Thought-Stopping Language.
Thought-terminating clich&eacute;s and slogans.</a>

<p> <li>
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_no_criticism" target="_blank">Inability To Tolerate Criticism</a>, and
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_personal_attacks" target="_blank">Personal Attacks On Critics</a>.

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_dishonesty" target="_blank">Dishonesty, deceit, and wild exaggeration of successes and praise</a>, accompanied by minimization and denial of faults and criticism.

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q3.html#cq_money_grubbing" target="_blank">The Cult is Money-Grubbing</a>.

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_not_accountable">The cult leader is not held accountable for his actions.</a>

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_guru_special" target="_blank">The Guru Is Extra-Special.</a>

<p> <li>
<a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_guru_bosses" target="_blank">Everybody else needs the
guru to boss him around, but nobody bosses the guru around.</a>

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q5.html#cq_guru_criticizes" target="_blank">The guru criticizes

<p> <li> And the problems of <a href="orange-cult_q4.html#cq_disturbed_guru" target="_blank"><i>Disturbed

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q7.html#cq_new_identity" target="_blank">New Identity &#8212;

<p> <li> <a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_own_you" target="_blank">The cult wants to own you.</a>

The claims of Buchman's followers that the Oxford Group or Moral Re-Armament
was <i>the only way</i> segued right into common cultish claims of
<i>&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q1.html#cq_cult_special" target="_blank">We Are Special</a>&quot;</i>,
and under-handed
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#cq_denigrate_others" target="_blank">attacks on other religions</a>.
The Buchmanites claimed that
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Buchman_insane" target="_blank">only they were &quot;sane&quot; and doing the
will of God</a>; and
only Buchmanites were &quot;closely in touch with God&quot;, and
listening to God, and Frank Buchman called those who had not joined
his cult &quot;pagans&quot;.

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Oxford Group's aim ever since the last war has been to give a whole
new pattern for statesmanship and a whole new level of responsible thinking &#8212;
faculties only given to men who are living under God's guidance, who
are changed through daily contact with God and through daily obedience to God.<br>

Frank Buchman felt that it was &quot;natural&quot; that he and his followers would end
up running the world:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In inspired democracy &quot;leadership goes to the spiritually fit&quot;, for
&quot;the people naturally choose as leaders those who are most clearly led
by God.&quot; (108) It is &quot;a new leadership, free from the bondage of fear,
rising above personal and national ambition and responsive to the direction
of God's will.&quot; (156)
Such leaders are &quot;super-statesmen who make God-control their
programme.&quot; (112)<br>

Such criticism of older churches shows the adolescent character of the
Oxford Groups. Frank Buchman's &quot;movement&quot; began with
groups of college students, and
Buchmanism took on an adolescent attitude which it never outgrew.
Just like an angry teenager who declares that his parents don't know
anything, Buchman's young followers declared that the old churches were
ineffective, meaningless, and useless, and those followers were quick
to assume that they had something brand new which the old fogies were
too dim-witted to see.
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The Groupist ignores the history of Christianity, and regards
the system of the Church as too apparently ineffective
to command acceptance. He moves at a stride from the Age of Apostles
to the present time, and assumes that the centuries of Christian
experience have nothing to teach him. Surely this is a position
which cannot seriously be defended.<br>

Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, had friends in the Oxford Group.
He wrote about Lord Salisbury:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Towards the end of his life he was somewhat attracted by the movement led by Dr. Frank
Buchman, that for no good reason arrogated to itself the title of 'Oxford Group'.
I do not doubt that this evangelistic venture has brought comfort and
assurance to many people, who would say that it had been the means of changing their
entire life by opening for them a door of direct approach to God. For many to whom
the regular rule and worship of the Church had made little appeal, or who had let go their
faith, the Group appeared to carry a message of hope, the value
of which was not to be under-rated.
But to the ordinary practising Christian, on the other hand, an irritating
feature of the Group has been the assumption on the part of many of those who were
caught up in it that they had discovered something entirely new, whereas there
was nothing whatever in the movement that was not readily available to all
Christians in far more just balance through the Christian religion.<br>

Another common cult characteristic that
Frank Buchman and his group showed was the
<a href="orange-cult_q6.html#cq_no_criticism" target="_blank">inability to tolerate
even the slightest criticism</a>. An MRA book published in 1954 went
so far as to declare that critics of MRA were immoral:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Moral Re-Armament cannot be honestly opposed on intellectual grounds
because it is basic truth. MRA is built on incontrovertible moral truth,
whose effectiveness, however it is applied throughout the world,
cannot be gainsaid.

It always comes from the morally defeated.<br>

In his charge against the Oxford Groups, Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of

<p>
<blockquote>

'I have found many of the rank and file of Group members eager and teachable.
But not the leaders. They will brook no criticism and rule it out as
&quot;unguided&quot;.
Even if the invitation to &quot;come in and change us&quot; is accepted,
it is soon found that real criticism is resented &#8212; as many have discovered
to their great unhappiness.
This is especially the case at Oxford where the Groups are
established as a cult, and strongly organized with a headquarters and a band
of full-time workers; and where, what one is bound to term, their
intolerance and exclusiveness is a strong and distressing feature.

... and the result of experience would seem to show that the circumference
of the Movement is much sounder than the centre; so that the deeper
you penetrate into its system the more unhappy you feel.'<br>

That is also a good description of most cults in general:
They often have a pleasant, inviting, and attractive exterior,
and appear to be good and virtuous and spiritual and admirable to the public,
but the core is rotten. The more one gets into a cult, the worse it gets.
After a new member joins, he finds the wonderful publicly-advertised
virtues negated by more sinister teachings. As

The Bishop Dr. Henson also wrote:

<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Before proceeding to consider the distinctive procedures of the 'Groups'
movement, there is one general characteristic to which I must direct your
attention, and which must certainly arouse the gravest misgivings
in the mind of every considering and instructed Christian.
<font color="blue">
I mean, its attitude of absolute authority and arrogant superiority
towards all who dissent from its claims or disapprove its methods.
</font>
This characteristic is, of course, a familiar mark of sectarianism.
The early Quakers were carried to strange excesses by their persuasion that
they were divinely inspired. They also faced their fellow Christians in the
tone of men who had a unique and infallible assurance of truth, whose witness
could only be rejected by those who were blinded by prejudice or enslaved by
sin. Similarly, the 'Groupists' adopt a tone of absolute authority, and
do not scruple to assume that criticism of their procedures can only issue from
morally disqualified persons. An illustration is provided to my hand by a new
volume written by a prominent leader of the Oxford 'Groupists', the Rev.
Geoffrey Allen, Fellow and Chaplain of Lincoln College.
I read this book with the more careful attention, since its author is one of
those younger Oxford scholars whose work in theology and criticism justifies the
largest hopes. Here is a book, I thought, which will be free from the
vulgarity of popular journalism, such as marked Mr. Russell's deplorable
volume, and will show no trace of the na&iuml;ve arrogance of ignorant
fervour which may be expected in the narratives of converts.
Mr. Allen is possessed of considerable literary power, and whatever he writes
is pleasant to read. But my satisfaction could go no farther.
The book confirmed my worst fears. Its tone of assured infallibility
revolted me. In the true spirit of fanaticism it disallows all criticism
which is not conditioned by submission to the movement.
In effect, it identifies 'Groupism' and Christianity so completely as to
use with respect to the one that absolute language of Divine claim which
belongs properly only to the other.
A perusal of Groupist literature has compelled me to conclude that Mr. Allen
is genuinely representative of the leaders of the movement.
This attitude of absolute claim which admits of no alternative save complete
acceptance is doubly regrettable. On the one hand, it ties the movement
fast to its own errors, for infallibility always involves this consequence
to all who are unwise enough to claim it that it prohibits reformation.
On the other hand, it makes impossible that ultimate reconciliation of 'Groups'
with the Church which every Churchman who recalls the dolorous history
of previous separations would desire to effect.<br>

The faithful Buchmanite Arthur James &quot;A. J.&quot; Russell, who wrote two
books of praise of Frank Buchman, complained in one of them about the
criticism that the Oxford Group was receiving:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
If you ask people to make radical changes in their lives and they don't obey,
they must pick holes in you. As Canon Grensted has it: &quot;When something
like the Group comes along and suggests that God be put in the first place
always, instead of tenth, and people find their disordered sentiments
threatened, they naturally begin to feel annoyed.&quot;<br>

<p>
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#AJRussell_arrogant1" target="_blank">A. J. Russell was actually so arrogant</a>
that he equated the Oxford Group Movement
with God. Russell was really world-class arrogant. He declared that
people who would not <i><b><font color="#9F0000">obey</font></b></i>
him and put the Oxford Group first in their lives were, in his mind,
refusing to &quot;put God in the first place&quot;,
and that's why they criticized Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group.<br>
<font color="blue"><i>
(That's the propaganda trick of

refusal to obey God.)

<p>
And that word <i>&quot;<font color="#9F0000">obey</font>&quot;</i> is really something else.
Apparently, Russell assumed that complete strangers were supposed
to <i><b><font color="#9F0000">obey</font></b></i> him and the other
Oxford Group recruiters when they came
around, presumably because the Groupists had orders straight
from God and knew God's Will and knew what was best for everybody else, while
the common rabble did not.
(And once again, they used <i>false equality</i> &#8212; the recruiters would say
that you should obey God, but they really expected you to obey them.)
No wonder the Member of Parliament from Oxford, A. P. Herbert,
said that &quot;the Buchmanites' methods were fascist-like and
<a href="orange-rroot420.html#Nazi_like" target="_blank">their evangelists Nazi-like</a>.&quot;

<p>
<a name="AJRussell_10"> </a>
In the early days, before the London newspaper reporter A. J. Russell was
&quot;changed&quot; into a true believer who never criticized Buchman,
Russell wanted to write a series of neutral, balanced, articles about Buchmanism.
Russell discovered that Frank Buchman would not tolerate even
the slightest criticism of his movement:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...Mr. Russell went on to suggest that, as in the case of
the &quot;My Religion&quot; series, readers should be invited to
air their views for and against the Movement.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Oh dear, no!&quot; said Dr. Buchman. He reinforced his own
opinion &#8212; quite a sound opinion on the advantages of newspaper
discussions &#8212; with the startling declaration that the Holy
Spirit's guidance was against the scheme.<br>

Likewise, Peter Howard,
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#Peter_Howard_9" target="_blank">the fascist disciple</a> of Frank Buchman who assumed

<p>
<blockquote>

...Christians forget that Christ was crucified not because he was wrong
but because He was right. There was one of Christ's contemporaries who,
while agreeing that the work being done was good, always disagreed with
the methods and thought he could do things better. He was critical of
the way money was spent, critical of the company Christ kept, critical of
his comrades. His name was Judas.<br>

Peter Howard clearly suggested that Frank Buchman's critics were acting just like Judas,
and then Howard immediately declared that he wasn't suggesting it.
<p>
Also notice the propaganda trick
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#false_history" target="_blank"><i>False Analysis of History</i></a>.
Jesus Christ was not crucified
&quot;because He was right&quot;; He was killed because he upset, threatened, and
scared the local established power figures, especially the Jewish

start a revolution that would cause the Romans to punish them all very harshly.

<p>
Peter Howard continued with his bitter complaints about criticism of MRA:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So many people are snobs of intellect. They write well, make money, gain titles
or preach splendidly but are helpless and barren when they meet a man
in need. They shine before men but change nobody.
They criticize those who have less polish and recognition than themselves,
forgetting that the first journeymen of Christ were fishermen, shepherds
and craftsmen of hand and heart, not crafty of head and great in human eyes.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is impossible in the space of this book to take up and refute all accusations
and charges made against men and women of Moral Re-Armament. But many of them
are self-contradictory and others are made with a shallowness of understanding
or a denial of reason which makes them worthless.<br>

<font size="-1"><i>Britain and the Beast</i>, Peter Howard, 1963, page 112-113.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
<font color="blue">
Peter Howard did not refute a single criticism of the Oxford Groups or Moral
Re-Armament there. He just used the propaganda techniques

to try to dismiss all of the criticism that he and his fellow cult

Peter Howard launched an <i>ad hominem</i> attack on his critics,
called them a variety of names,
and accused them of being &quot;polished snobs of intellect&quot;,
and then ran away without actually answering any of the
charges against the Oxford Groups, by claiming that the criticism wasn't worth refuting.
<p>
Peter Howard also used the propaganda trick of
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#unsubstantiated_inference" target="_blank"><i>Unsubstantiated Inference</i></a>,
saying of his critics that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They shine before men but change nobody.&quot;<br>
</font>
Well, neither did the Buchmanites.
The Oxford Groups and Moral Re-Armament were
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#short_term" target="_blank">notorious for <i>not</i> making any lasting changes</a>
in their converts. People would claim to be &quot;changed&quot; at a rally or
house party, but were very soon back to their same old bad habits.

<p>
Marjorie Harrison spoke of the emotional appeal of Buchmanism to
prospective new recruits, and the suppression of criticism:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The emotional appeal would have less influence if every
attempt at intellectual honesty &#8212; called criticism by the Group &#8212;
was not extinguished. Criticism from outside the Group cannot be
prevented.
It is combated not by a defence or an answer, but by an
assumption of indifference. It is merely an assumption of indifference
for criticism is desperately feared just as advertisement is welcomed.
Within the Group criticism is absolutely forbidden.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This is for an excellent reason. The insidiously harmful teachings
cannot be defended.
Stripped of these elaborations there would stand
revealed the simple and sane teaching of Christianity: the Christianity
that has been found difficult and not tried. Buchmanism has been
tried and found easy and swallowed wholesale.<br>

(Notice that A.A. uses exactly the same &quot;assumption of indifference&quot; to criticism.
A.A. leaders refuse to argue with critics, and claim that they have &quot;no opinion&quot; on &quot;outside issues.&quot;
And anything that they don't want to talk about is called an outside issue, no matter whether it is the rape of women in
A.A., the immense A.A. dropout rate and failure rate, coercive recruiting,
telling sick people not to take their medications,
junior cult leaders setting up their own cults and exploiting newcomers, or the A.A. leaders stealing the money.)

his followers. He is always evasive. A definite criticism voiced

<a href="orange-rroot960.html#WHClark" target="_blank">Walter Houston Clark</a>

In proportion as a person is sure that God is speaking to him

to evil forces and feel himself persecuted. It is his simple view
of the relation between God and man that makes Buchman so sure
of the &quot;Guidance&quot; that comes to him in his &quot;Quiet Time.&quot;

finds not only in him but among his followers.<br>

Indeed. If you are convinced that you are talking directly to God and
getting your orders directly from Him, then someone who disagrees with you
and opposes your activities <i>must</i> of necessity be evil and working
for <i>The Forces of Darkness</i>. Why else, how else,
could anyone possibly be opposed to your divine work?
When you are absolutely certain that you are getting your instructions directly from
God, that simply leaves no room for humility or tolerance of
any other people's differing opinions or viewpoints.

In Frank's fellowship, there were plenty of internal, individual <u>mea culpas</u>.
Indeed, assertions that &quot;I'm wrong&quot;
were <u>de rigueur</u> for the MRA team person.
&quot;A small sense of sin means a small sense of Christ; a great
sense of sin means a great sense of Christ.&quot;
The line in the movie <u>Love Story</u>, &quot;Love means you never have to
say you're sorry,&quot; was opposite to the team approach.
For labor-management problems and other conflicts, honest apology was
&quot;the high road to honest peace.&quot; One of the cleverest MRA songs to hit
the stage was Blanton Belk and his sisters harmonizing of &quot;Sorry is
a magic little word.&quot;<sup>62</sup>

But this did not apply to the corporate entity, and certainly not to
Frank Buchman. There was never any corporate confession of sin.</font>
All major decisions for decades, and a host of minor ones as well, were
made by the leader. He was guided by God. Therefore to criticize aims
and strategies of the force as a whole was to suggest that Frank's touch
with the Almighty had on occasion been flawed. An[d] that was to think
the unthinkable. If such a reflection should be shared on the inside,
its author would be regarded as needing attention to his thinking or his
piety, or both. If such questions were raised by someone on the outside,
chances were good that the originator was either subversive or living
an immoral life.<br>

Newcomers and the rank and file members were expected to confess that they

Marjorie Harrison described her experiences as a newcomer to the
Oxford Group meetings:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...you are bound to fall under the spell of the most
disarming friendliness that you have ever encountered.
<font color="#9F0000">
[<i>It's called
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_q2.html#cq_aggressive_recruiting" target="_blank">love bombing</a>&quot;.</i>]
</font>
The friendliness continues as long as you are a hearer of the word
as interpreted by people anxious to add your soul's scalp to the
rest of their collection.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
They will bear &#8212; for a little time &#8212; with some criticism. But
if you fail to acquiesce in conviction and that fairly quickly,
then you are no longer interesting, and in the end, you find
yourself exhorted from the platform to &quot;pack up your
criticisms with your luggage and GO &#8212; you are of no use.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One young man, at that last meeting of the Eastbourne House Party,
stung by this, rose to his feet and, an almost lone critic in the
midst of an audience composed of Groupers, or those sympathetic
to the Movement, flung back in a few words the challenge of all
those thousands of anxious and serious people who fail to see in
the Group the answer to their own or the world's problems.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;I have been afraid of God all my life,&quot; he said.
&quot;I have been hag-ridden by God. I came to learn. I cannot
accept all your teaching, and so you tell me I am no use. You
tell me to go. I will go.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&quot;Yes. Go!&quot; said Frank from the platform. &quot;Go and
talk it over outside.&quot;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And he went. He was the most desperately sincere, the most moving
and the most convincing speaker I heard during the thirteen meetings
of the Group that I attended during that House Party.
Dr. Buchman told me he had sent back an apology. I hope he did
nothing of the sort. The Group owed to him the deepest and
humblest apology for his was the cry of a tormented soul.
A thousand men and women would echo it.
He was the only person in all the House Party who seemed to have
suffered spiritual travail. &quot;Religion never meant anything&quot;
that is what the Groupers say almost invariably.
To this boy religion had obviously meant something.
He had been &quot;hag-ridden&quot; by God.
Religion had been a disrupting force and his life its battlefield.
He did not want the joy and the fun and the thrill offered
by the Group. He rejected the blatantly superstitious interpretation
of the Guidance of God &#8212; and because he had courage and deep
feeling, the Group told him to go. They had no use for him.
He was followed from the hall by several young men who were
prepared to &quot;change&quot; but not help him.
But he had been publicly humiliated and his genuine desire for
true guidance had been rejected.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In that incident you see revealed the whole weakness of the Group.<br>

<p><br><center><img src="http://www.orange-papers.info:80/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br>

Another common bad characteristic of cults that Buchman's Groups displayed
was dishonesty, deceit, and wild exaggeration of successes and praise,
accompanied by minimization and denial of faults and criticism.
Rev. John A. Richardson wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I have said that there is no room for doubt that many lives are being
transformed through the activities of the Groups Movement.
It will not do, however, to accept at their face value all the jubilant
reports of victories won that are trumpeted abroad with such persistent
optimism.
That notable victories have been won will not be denied, but it is quite
certain that in their announcement there has been not seldom gross
exaggeration.
The fact is that the publicity work of the Movement is extraordinarily
effective, and by its aid the achievements of the Groups has been widely
heralded, while nothing has been said of their frequent failures.
Miss Marjorie Harrison comments ironically upon that fact in her
description of one of the gatherings of the Groups in London, of
which she was an eye-witness. The Groups preach &quot;'absolute honesty,'&quot;
she says, &quot;and Dr. Buchman, standing on a platform, holds up a
Canadian newspaper and draws attention to the streamer headlines
in favour of the Group. He reads extracts; he reels off figures;
he gives the impression that all Canada has been swept into the
Movement. He does not show the other side of the picture. He is
entirely one-sided. There is no mention of the scathing criticisms
and denunciations that met the Group&quot; (<i>Saints Run Mad</i>,
p. 145).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Speaking within my own knowledge, the Groups had recently a great
campaign in St. John, N. B., for the success of which the most
extravagant claims were made. Enormous crowds were naturally
attracted to the meetings, and not a few individuals received
spiritual help, who are today, I am sure, witnesses to the fact.
It is undoubtedly true, however, that a vast number of those present
at the various meetings were there out of curiosity alone, and
remain untouched. Yet an official statement was sent through the
press from one end of Canada to the other which was calculated to
give the impression that the entire city, and other parts of the
province, had been stirred to the very depths. It was a piece of
flamboyant advertising for which there was absolutely no foundation
in fact.<br>
<a name="Shoemaker3"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such cases of publicity exaggeration are, as I have said, not at all
uncommon. Thus the Rev. Samuel M. Shoemaker, Jr., writes as follows
in an article entitled, &quot;The Church and the Oxford Group,&quot;
<i>The Living Church</i>, Jan. 21, 1933:
<font color="#4f007f">
The reception which the Oxford Group had in Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto,
can only be called in St. Paul's words a 'triumph in Christ.'
Night after night, thousands of people came out to hear the simple
message of witness from varied types.&quot;</font>
So far as the vast attendance at the meetings is concerned, the
statement is, no doubt, entirely accurate. In view of the world-wide
publicity given to the activities of the Movement, it could hardly
be otherwise.
When Mr. Shoemaker goes on, however, to quote with approval the
statement of &quot;a business man from Ottawa&quot; that, as a result
of the campaign, there were more Oxford Groups in that city than there
were bridge parties, one may be pardoned for registering a doubt.
For myself, I can only say that I have gone to some trouble to make
inquiries in reliable quarters recently, and I find nothing to suggest
that the effect of the campaign in Ottawa was of the revolutionary
character claimed by Mr. Shoemaker.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Credit has been claimed by the leaders of the Groups for the most
striking achievements in the arena of political and public life.
The world has repeatedly been told, for example, that the Groups
brought peace and harmony out of political chaos and conflict in
South Africa. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
<font color="#9F0000">
[They didn't; <a href="orange-rroot240.html#SA1" target="_blank">see quotes below</a>.]<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One would not impute deliberate misstatement, but there is little room
to doubt that, in their enthusiasm, the leaders of the Groups
are guilty of unpardonable exaggeration in the claims for success
that they send out to the world. It is highly probable that
Mr. Henry P. Van Dusen is not far from the truth when he says in his
vivid study of Dr. Buchman in The <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, July, 1934,
that there is in him a &quot;tendency, almost juvenile in its na&iuml;evet&eacute;,
to see the virtues of his associates, the quality of their performance,
and the significance of their achievements, somewhat out of true perspective.
This tendency pervades the entire Movement, but it is a contagion caught
from Mr. Buchman's own habitual attitude.<br>

It would be a grave mistake to reckon the value of a spiritual movement
merely by counting heads but M. Desplanques, while admitting fully
the great impetus given by the movement to the lives of many, feels
obliged to stress the fact that there is some unreality in the
'Advertisement' atmosphere which boasts of large scale conversions,
while refusing to supply any figures at all. In America he compares the
results in the larger universities to the temperature chart of a fever
patient, so rapid are the rises and falls.<br>

The 'Groupists' are curiously unconscious of previous essays in
extra-ecclesiastical revivalism, inspired like their own by the ideal
of a restored 'first-century Christianity,' and also finding in
the New Testament at once their credentials and their models.
<font color="blue">
The claim to originality is of course characteristic of new movements,
and need express nothing worse than the pardonable self-delusion
of enthusiasm. Youth tends ever to megalomania.
</font>
Nevertheless
megalomania is a perilous temper, and cannot wisely be left
uncorrected. One previous essay is so recent in time, and so
kindred in character, as to be fresh in our recollection.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A few years ago much public attention was directed to the activities of
the faith healer, Mr. [J. M.] Hickson. These were, he maintained, precisely as the
Groupists maintain with respect to their own movement, an essay in
first-century Christianity. &nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The parallel between Mr. Hickson and the Rev. Frank Buchman is not
limited to their claim that they are reviving 'first-century Christianity'.
Both build much on the results of their work. 'Groupism' is,
in the Rev. S. M. Shoemaker's phrase, <i>'Religion that Works'</i>.
Mr. Hickson might have adopted the phrase. He was able to produce a list
of witnesses not less impressive than those which are paraded by the
'Groupists'. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
In South Africa his success was reported to be not less impressive,
and this is the more noteworthy since it is precisely in South Africa
that the success of the 'Groups' is alleged to have been most astonishing.
I observe with some interest that both Mr. Hickson and the 'Groupists' adduce
the evidence of a Presbyterian clergyman, the Rev. E. Macmillan of Pretoria.
He compared Mr. Hickson's mission to a 'spiritual earthquake', a
new thing in his experience, 'more truly and deeply spiritual than the
old-time evangelical revivals.'<font size="-1"><sup>1</sup></font>
This was in 1922. In 1929 the same gentleman wrote with equal fervour
about the mission of the 'Groupists'. He made, however, no mention
of the 'spiritual earthquake' which, only seven years earlier, had
stirred him so deeply.
During the sessions of the Lamberth Conference in 1930 I asked
several Australian and South African Bishops whether the results of
Mr. Hickson's mission, to which such confident attestation had been
given, had been as extensive and as permanent as might have been
expected, but I found no reason for thinking that either the
physical health or the moral level of the populations had been appreciably
affected. What is the inference?<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We cannot surely be mistaken if we think that both Mr. Hickson's
'Faith-healing Mission' and Mr. Buchman's 'Groups' illustrate characteristics
of sect-movements in every age, the tendency of enthusiasts to exaggerate
the originality and the value of their own religious methods, and the
facility with which good Christians, when they handle the New Testament,
may be entangled in a literalism which is equally irrational and perilous.
Mr. Hickson's book, <i>Heal the Sick</i>, published in 1924, should stand
on the student's bookshelf alongside Mr. Russell's book, <i>For
Sinners Only</i>, published in 1932. They are the latest descriptions
we possess of a religious phenomenon which has been recurrent in
Christian experience from the first. We may add that both books
have secured a wide circulation.<br>

Likewise, the Buchmanite Groups' grand claims of success in changing
many tens of thousands of people into morally-reformed individuals were never
verified, and the changes were simply assumed to be permanent.
The Groups' publications used the
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof By Anecdote</a></i>
and
<i><a href="orange-propaganda.html#testimonials" target="_blank">Testimonials</a></i>
propaganda techniques,
attempting to convince people by overwhelming them with positive testimonial
stories.
Dr. Herbert Hensley Henson, the Bishop of Durham, wrote in 1933:
<p>
<a name="mental_collapse"> </a>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I observe that Groupist literature is to a large extent composed of
records of 'life-changing'. These are generally anonymous, and in
their circumstances extraordinary.
They are commonly presented in picturesque and dramatic language which
sometimes reproduces the too-familiar features of popular journalism,
and they seem to be designed to bear down opposition by their
cumulative effect, and so to coerce the reluctant understanding
into acceptance of Groupist claims. &nbsp; ... &nbsp;
In these records of Groupist activities
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#observational" target="_blank">we are given the successes,
but not the failures</a>.
Those who have had the best opportunities for watching the
working of the new movement are impressed by the latter
hardly less than by the former.
I am not thinking mainly of
<font color="blue">
those woeful instances, of which the
number appears to be disconcertingly large, in which
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#Beverly_Nichols_breakdown" target="_blank">complete nervous and mental collapse</a>
followed in the wake of the vehement
excitements of Groupism</font>, but rather I have in mind
the very large number of those who have been alienated by
Groupist methods or who, after yielding themselves
to groupist domination, have reacted from it rather calamitously.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<font color="blue">
There are no statistics more dubious and more misleading than those of
religious conversion, for they are marked by all the defects which can
reduce the value of statistics. They are compiled in circumstances
highly unfavorable to accuracy. The compilers are always interested
persons whose good faith is no guarantee of competence.
They are never checked, and in the nature of the case cannot be confirmed.
</font>
In the highly artificial atmosphere of a 'house party', or in the
emotional excitement of a public meeting, when the subtle influence
of 'mass-suggestion' is at its height, and there are the strongest
inducements bearing on individuals to profess what is so plainly
expected and so ardently desired,
<font color="blue">
it cannot be surprising that
decisions and experiences alleged in perfect sincerity which none
the less may not have been as complete as was supposed, and may not
be as permanent as is assumed. These are registered with exultation
by those who find in them the Divine sanction of their own spiritual
exertions; and they are published to the world without delay.<br>
</font>
<a name="short_term"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The clergy often and justly lament the lapse from communion of the majority
of those who have been confirmed. ...
These emotional confessions, made in circumstances of great excitement
under the pressure of crowd-sentiment, do not wear well.
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;
<font color="blue">
Enthusiasm has little staying power, but immense self-confidence.
'Life-changing' is no such prompt and easy achievement as Groupists
seem to suggest.<br>
</font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Such and such evil practices may, of course, be made to cease, and
such and such pious observances be adopted, but <i>veritas temporis filia</i>,
only Time can certify the measure, quality, and permanence
of the change of life. Somewhere in his essays Emerson observes that
the weak point about good resolutions is the fact that, even while
we indulge the luxury of framing them, we know in the background of
our minds that the task of carrying them into effect will have to be
entrusted to the same old incorrigible law-breaker who has so often
betrayed us in the past.<br>

<p>
Rev. John Richardson reported much the same thing:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nor in a vast number of cases is it safe to assume that the life-changing,
for which credit is so confidently claimed, permanent in character.
It is notorious that no statistics are more open to suspicion, and
none must be more liberally discounted, than those designed to set forth
the results of highly organized and intensive efforts of a revival
character. In the emotional atmosphere of such gatherings, and under the
pressure of &quot;mass suggestion&quot; skilfully and continuously applied,
men and women are too easily swept off their feet into acts of
surrender and profession that are carefully noted, and receive full
publicity, while little is known and less said, of the lapses that so
often follow.
<font color="blue">
The credit side of the account is kept with care, while the debit side is blank.
</font>
There is no reason to believe that this
phenomenon has been absent from the evangelistic efforts of the Groups.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Evidence to that end comes, indeed, from all sides.
Mr. R. H. S. Crossman, Fellow of New College, Oxford, writes as follows
in <i>Oxford and the Groups</i> (p. 105):
&quot;In their recent American tour, the Groups on at least three
occasions &#8212; Detroit, Louisville, and Phoenix &#8212; found the work
of conversion far harder in <i>towns where they had previously
worked:</i>
<font color="#9F0000">
still more significant, at Louisville, where two years previously
hundreds had made their surrender, they found only eleven who had
remained in any sense active members.&quot;</font>
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is not too much to say, I think, that under the magnetic power
of Dr. Buchman's leadership there has been developed in the Groups
an appreciation of the power of publicity, and an astuteness in its
use, that the exponents of high-pressure salesmanship might be
disposed to envy. It is one of the least appealing characteristics
of the Movement, and lies upon its very surface.<br>

One Oxford Group member, 
<a href="orange-rroot990.html#TWHunter0" target="_blank">T. Willard Hunter</a>, did quite a twisty song and dance
as he tried to explain away Frank Buchman's habit of grossly exaggerating his successes,
and even outright lying:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

What appears to be exaggeration is party due to a stance which Sam
Shoemaker noted, &quot;All Frank's geese are swans. It is partly his intense
enthusiasm and belief in us which keeps us functioning!&quot;<font size="-1"><sup>30</sup></font>
Buchman was everlastingly Mr. Positive Thinking and Mr. Possibility Thinking
rolled into one. The glass is never half empty, always half full.
The next person he met was capable of turning the world upside down by the
end of the week. Anyone can recognize there is untold power available to
one who operates that way. I expect also that Frank was confident the Almighty
would not be too severe if he should occasionally exercise a salesman's
license for enthusiasm and stretch a point.
Surely he would be forgiven under the rubric of the Congressional cloak
rooms where gentlemen agree there are times when one must &quot;rise above
principle.&quot; It does not negate the impressively solid accomplishments of
the work to concede that it was at times inflated with puffery.<br>

Bill Wilson studied Frank Buchman's techniques, and obviously learned his lessons well.
Bill used the very same publicity techniques for Alcoholics Anonymous.
Wilson also made grandiose public claims of originality &#8212; saying
that he had discovered
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#important_discovery" target="_blank">
a wonderful new cure for alcoholism</a> when he had discovered nothing new at all
&#8212; and Wilson made

The public was told about purported successes, but never about the many more failures.
<p>
Two thirds of the entire <i>Alcoholics Anonymous</i> &quot;Big Book&quot;
was and is nothing but such anecdotal stories
of A.A. successes, but there isn't a single honest story of an
A.A. failure to be found anywhere in there.
And we were never told when the so-called &quot;miracles&quot; wore off
and the much-publicized successes
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses" target="_blank">relapsed and disappeared</a>.

Bill Wilson didn't honestly report that &#8212; he just silently replaced their stories
with more stories from some other people who also claimed that the
wonderful, never-fails, A.A. program had saved their lives.
You will never learn from official A.A. Council-approved literature that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#BB_relapses" target="_blank">fully 50% of the original
first-edition <i>Big Book</i> authors relapsed and returned to a life
of drinking</a>.

<p>
And today, the Alcoholics Anonymous headquarters is becoming more and
more vague about just
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">how many people A.A. is
really keeping sober</a>, and what the A.A. success rate really is.
On
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_dropouts" target="_blank">their triennial membership surveys</a>,
where they count heads and collect data about people's sobriety,
they have even stopped asking critical questions like
&quot;what is the A.A. dropout rate&quot;,
because the results are so bad that they are an embarrassment
to the A.A. organization.
<p>
I predict that next they will stop asking how many people were coerced
or forced into A.A. by the courts, prisons, parole officers, counselors or
&quot;treatment programs&quot;, because the recent A.A. surveys revealed that
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#Grapevine" target="_blank">the majority of the current
membership was forced, in one way or another, to join Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.
A.A. is not a friendly &quot;<a href="orange-traditions.html#trad11" target="_blank">program of attraction</a>&quot;

proselytizing team like this:

<blockquote>

All travelers through California make for the Mission Inn, at Riverside.
Soon interested in the group, the managers gave us the lowest rate they
ever quoted, and a house-party of 500 gathered in mid-February.
People came for training, to discover next steps, and took them as
thoroughbreds take hurdles. Others came for their first touch with
a group. A young wife, appalled at the financial catastrophe which had
overtaken her husband almost immediately after their marriage, found a
new security better and beyond a security in money; her witness has
since resulted in spiritual children and grandchildren.
An actor, a dozen clergymen, widows of two Presbyterian missionaries
who nursed resentment against God for the loss of their husbands, at
least six whole families of modern, prosperous pagans, and also several
members on the staff of the inn &#8212; all came into new or deeper
experiences of a living Christ.<br>

propaganda techniques.
They just reeled off a bunch of stories of conversions, as if that
was proof of something. They didn't report their failures.

in order to have those &quot;spiritual children&quot;.
<li> And then both the Oxford Groups and A.A. held out the bait of a promised wonderful

Another common cult characteristic that the Oxford Group Movement displayed
is pretty obviously
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_disturbed_guru" target="_blank"><i>Disturbed Guru, Mentally Ill Leader</i></a>.
In the file <i>&quot;The Funny Spirituality of Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous&quot;</i>,
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Narcissistic" target="_blank">I build a case
for Bill Wilson having suffered from a Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>,
and he doesn't
appear to be the only one. There was a fair amount of similarity
between the behavior of Frank Buchman and Bill Wilson.
Frank Buchman showed a lot of the signs of NPD, too.
<p>
We especially have to ask the question, &quot;Why would a man do that?
Why would a man act like that? Why would a man behave in such a manner for
his entire life?&quot; Frank Buchman's behavior was so extreme
that it went way beyond mere vanity or ambition or the desire to live in luxury.
It wasn't just a man
wanting to be the leader, or wanting to be admired and called 'a man of God'.
It wasn't just a man putting on airs, and claiming that he was special, and that
God was talking to him all day long.

<h2>301.81 Narcissistic Personality Disorder</h2>
<p>
<h3>Diagnostic Criteria</h3>
<p>
A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for
admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and
present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of
the following:
<p>
<a name="ftnt097_ret"> </a>
<ol>
<li> has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates
achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior
without commensurate achievements)<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Pretty obviously, Frank Buchman thought he was on a mission from God,
destined to save the whole world.
<ul>
<li>
In 1921, at Cambridge, Frank Buchman was bicycling one night when he imagined that
he heard the voice of God saying to him,
<font color="#9F0000">&quot;I will use you to remake the world.&quot;</font>
Later, in his room, the thought came to him again and again.
Buchman concluded that God was calling him to a great task, and he decided to
accept the commission.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt097">97</a></sup></font>

<li>
Buchman imagined that he talked to God, and that God talked back to him, all of the time.
<li> When Buchman claimed that the current
guidance that Oxford Group members (like him) were receiving
was just as authoritative as
the stories in the Bible, he was even putting himself on a level with
the Biblical saints and prophets.
<li>
Buchman expected and even demanded that he be acknowledged as superior &#8212;
he had to always be lauded as a great spiritual leader, and he
considered anyone who dared to disagree with him to be certainly
wrong, and even immoral and working for the forces of Evil.
<li>
And Buchman habitually exaggerated and lied about his
achievements, accomplishments, and talents. Everything about Buchman was
grandiose.
</ul>
</i>
</font>

<li> is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power,
brilliance, beauty, or ideal love<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Yes, like Absolute Love, Absolute Honesty, Absolute Purity, and Absolute Unselfishness.
And he saw himself as the future minister to the world's leaders.
He thought his &quot;Movement&quot; was going to take over the whole world.
</i>
</font>

<li> believes that he or she is &quot;special&quot; and unique and can only
be understood by, or should associate with, other special or
high-status people (or institutions)<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Yes, Buchman felt like only associating with millionaires,
political leaders, nobility, and royalty,
and &quot;spiritual&quot; people who agreed with him about everything,
and who would sing his praises unceasingly.
</i>
</font>

<a name="ftnt124_ret"> </a>
<li> requires excessive admiration<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Obviously true of Frank Buchman. His need for admiration was so extreme that when the London
newspaper reporter A. J. Russell wrote a flattering article about Frank Buchman and his Oxford
Group &quot;house parties&quot;, Buchman mailed copies of it to nearly 10,000
people.<font size="-1" target="_blank"><sup><a href="orange-rroot960.html#ftnt124">124</a></sup></font>
</i>
</font>

<li> has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations
of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his
or her expectations<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Obviously yes. He demanded total automatic compliance from others.
They had to &quot;surrender&quot; to him and obey him without question.
And he certainly felt entitled to live a luxurious first-class lifestyle
at other people's expense.
<!------------------------------------------------
When Frank Buchman was criticized for his self-indulgence,
he answered with another question,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Why shouldn't we stay in 'posh' hotels?
Isn't God a millionaire?&quot;</font><br>
<font color="#9F0000">
(No, actually, Jesus Christ was never rich with gold and silver.
Jesus was born in a stable, not the Waldorf-Astoria.)
</font>
-------------------------------------------------->
</i>
</font>

<li> is interpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others
to achieve his or her own ends<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Yes. Like all cult leaders, Frank Buchman was extremely exploitative.
Buchman didn't care if he wasted other peoples' entire lives, misleading
and deceiving them, getting them to work for him for free in the name of God.

</ul>
</i>
</font>

<li> lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the
feelings and needs of others<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Obviously true of Buchman. He was one hard-hearted cold fish and he
didn't care whom he hurt.
And Buchman does not really seem to have cared about their
spiritual well-being either. In spite of some decorative jabber about
giving people
<i>&quot;new or deeper experiences of a living Christ&quot;</i>,
Buchman actually showed little concern for whether people got into Heaven
or remained in the church or even remained believers.
Buchman routinely rejected and drove away any and all people who dared
to question or criticize him.
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------
<LI>
And Buchman would later abandon the promotion of Christianity and instead
claim that his teachings were completely compatible with Buddhism, Hinduism,
or Islam. So all of the grandiose talk about giving people
<i>&quot;new or deeper experiences of a living Christ&quot;</i>
was just some more false advertising.
-------------------------------------------------------->
</i>
</font>

<li> is often envious of others or believes that others are envious
of him or her<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>That sounds familiar.
</i>
</font>

<li> shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>No question about it.
</i>
</font>

</ol>
<p>
<h3>Associated Features</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Vulnerability in self-esteem makes individuals with Narcissistic
Personality Disorder very sensitive to &quot;injury&quot; from criticism or
defeat. Although they may not show it outwardly, criticism may haunt
these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded,
hollow and empty. They may react with disdain, rage, or defiant
counterattack. Such experiences often lead to social withdrawal or
an appearance of humility that may mask and protect the grandiosity.<br>
<font color="blue"><i>
Extreme intolerance of criticism was one of Frank Buchman's worst characteristics.
And yes, he reacted to even a vague hint of criticism
with &quot;disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack&quot;.
<a href="orange-rroot120.html#trail_of_broken" target="_blank">As Henry P. van Dusen wrote</a>,
&quot;It is significant that Mr. Buchman's career
has left a trail of broken and raw relationships, of men and women
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_enemy" target="_blank">branded as enemies</a>
because they ventured to raise doubt about some
element in his programme or the infallibility of his judgement.&quot;
</i></font>

<li> Interpersonal relations are typically impaired due to problems
derived from entitlement, the need for admiration, and the relative
disregard for the sensitivities of others.<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Totally true of Frank Buchman &#8212; The only lasting interpersonal relationships he
had were with grovelling sycophants. He drove everybody else away.
And Buchman felt entitled to first class everything
because he was &quot;working for God&quot;; he had an extreme need for
admiration; and he cruelly disregarded the sensitivities of others.</i>
</font>

<li> Though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to
high achievement, performance may be disrupted due to intolerance
of criticism or defeat.<br>
<font color="blue">
<i>Buchman was <b>&quot;Mr. Overweening Ambition&quot;</b> personified. He wanted
to take over the whole world, but his intolerance of criticism and disregard
for the feelings of others brought him even more criticism and opposition.

Sometimes, not infrequently as time went on, Buchman used to shout at his
colleagues. Austin points out that people do sometimes have such tough
hides of self-esteem or hypocrisy that it may be the only way to get
through, yet admits that 'Frank, especially when in pain, was
<a href="orange-funny_spirituality.html#Bernstein_vampires" target="_blank">too violent
in his rebuke</a>'. Dr Irene Gates, who could be stern with him, warned him
sometime in 1941, after he had dressed down some of his colleagues with
a considerable burst of temper, that, if he wished to live, he would have
to forego that kind of explosion.<br>

Henry P. van Dusen wrote an analysis of Frank Buchman and his movement
for <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine in 1934, and said:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
Here we meet another of the most conspicuous marks of the man &#8212; his unshakable
certitude in his own 'leading.' Never for a fleeting instant or in any
possible circumstances is he unsure in speech or action.
It makes no difference whether the matter concerns the strategy for winning
a continent or the relief of an over-solemn meeting by an injection of
humor, the right word to say to impress an official whose favor controls
doors of opportunity or the right necktie to wear to win the confidence
of a particulary fastidious Eton boy. As a matter of fact, in his view,
each of these matters may be equally important; that is why God guides
us in the selection of our haberdashery.
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Hence, in part, springs Mr. Buchman's extraordinary authority among his
following, an authority not superimposed but gladly accorded.
He is always quietly sure he is right. ... Such certainty is possible
because Mr. Buchman knows his every thought and action to be immediately
determined by the Divine Mind; it is the direct corollary of his belief
in Divine Guidance.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1"><i>Apostle to the Twentieth Century; Frank N. D. Buchman:
Founder of the Oxford Group Movement</i>, Henry P. van Dusen,
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i> magazine, 154:1-16, July 1934, pages 8-9.
</font>
<p>
<font color="blue">
For someone to imagine that he can never be wrong is another delusion of grandeur,
and so is the belief that his every thought has been put into his head by God.
It was downright insane for Buchman to imagine that God told him which tie to wear.
(Remember that the other Buchmanites considered themselves lucky
to get one or two &quot;luminous thoughts&quot; during an entire
Quiet Hour, but Frank Buchman claimed
that he was in <i>constant conscious contact</i> with God.)
<p>
In addition, someone who is <i>&quot;Never for a fleeting instant or in
any possible circumstances ... unsure in speech or action&quot;</i> is
shallow, thoughtless, and impulsive. A thoughtful wise man pauses to consider his actions
and ask himself whether his course of action is right and wise and the best thing to do.
Someone without any self-doubts whatsoever is a megalomaniac and a narcissist.
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Buchman's followers were guilty of spiritual laziness and spiritual
cowardice &#8212; they were attracted to someone who claimed to never be wrong because
they wanted
<a href="orange-cult_q0.html#certainty" target="_blank">a guaranteed ticket to Heaven</a>.
They wanted to be freed from all doubts and also spared from the bother of having
to think for themselves. (&quot;<i>Don't think, just do what Frank says.
He's always right.&quot;</i>)
But Buchman's followers were overlooking the simple fact that just because
a man is very convincing does not prove that he is right.
<p>
<a name="AJRussell_11"> </a>
A. J. Russell, one of Frank Buchman's fawning followers, even wrote of Buchman:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is impossible to understand Frank at all unless he is thought of
as always in God's presence, listening for direction and accepting power,
which he says is the normal way for a sane human to live.
Frank is an example of the psychologically mature man, thoroughly
integrated round the highest relationship possible to man.
He does not wander voluntarily in his spiritual life: he goes direct to
the Source all of the time, and expects the Source to come to him.
This discipline at the heart of the movement means complete freedom.
The paradox of Christianity.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Frank is a child listening to God and obeying Him implicitly, and getting
all those around him to do the same. And no one will ever understand this
movement who does not accept this as a working hypothesis, whether he believes
it or not at the start. After a time he begins to see it is true.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Frank himself lived this way. &quot;Freedom of the spirit&quot; was his watchword.
He did not make his own morality a personal concern. The four standards
were not for him a checklist. His measuring rod was rather his own inner
revelation. Since for him there was no human reference point, he was a
law unto himself. The king could do no wrong. His own posture was basically
antinomian.<br>

<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is reported that the first serious inner crisis in Mr. Buchman's life
occurred when a fellow seminary student accused him of ambition.
The deliberate selection of a difficult and obscure post for his first
ministry was his response to the charge.
Apparently the suggestion touched a sensitive point of consciousness.
In the years since, Mr. Buchman has often been accused of ambition,
of unfairness, of intolerance, of hypersensitiveness to criticism,
of self-righteousness, of courting opposition.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman" color="blue">[Narcissistic inability to tolerate criticism.]<br></font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Now the line between personal ambition and passionate concern for God's work
may be a very narrow one. It is clear that from very early in his career
Mr. Buchman has felt himself designated for important tasks, and equipped with
gifts adequate to their importance.

Moreover, he has been driven by an overmastering sense of urgency and
a corresponding impatience with cowardly or half-hearted or conventional
measures. He has known God's Will for himself, for the church, and
often for others.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman" color="blue">[More delusions of grandeur.]<br></font>
As a result, he has been unable to conceal his contempt for what he believes
to be the incomplete dedication which characterizes most Christians, even
those in responsible leadership.
He has been unable to check a quick disdain for the lumbering and inept
and ineffective efforts of most workers within the church.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman" color="blue">[Narcissistic <i>&quot;arrogant,
haughty behaviors and attitudes&quot;</i>, as well as <i>&quot;the relative
disregard for the sensitivities of others.&quot;</i>]<br></font>
He has been unable to stifle sharp resentment at any who might raise questions
as to the soundness of his own vision or the wisdom and effectiveness
of his methods.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman" color="blue">[Narcissistic inability to tolerate criticism.]<br></font>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So certain is he of the indispensable importance of that which he knows
himself called to do &#8212; winning individuals one by one to complete surrender
of their lives, and then to the winning of others &#8212; that everyone else
<i>must</i> be called to precisely the same task.
In his view of the Christian enterprise, there is no division of responsibility
in this matter; all are required to be 'soul surgeons.'
This is the <i>sine qua non</i> of the Christian life. No one &#8212;
statesman, physician, research scientist, bootblack, bishop &#8212; is
excused from that primary responsibility.
Nor is this all. No one is recognized as really winning souls effectively
unless he is doing it in precisely the manner developed by Mr. Buchman.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman" color="blue">[Still some more delusions of grandeur
&#8212; <i>&quot;I'm right and everybody else is wrong. Everyone must
follow my lead and do things my way.&quot;</i>]<br></font>
<a name="van_Dusen_Atlantic2"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
This is one aspect of the picture. There is another. Not only is Mr. Buchman
unsparingly rigorous in his estimate of the effectiveness of others;
he will not abide the slightest questioning of his own work or that of
his colleagues, except from those fully within the Movement.
When queries are raised by outsiders, they are not met with reasoned
rebuttal.
'Win your argument and lose your man' is one of his favorite warnings.
The best defense is a vigorous attack.
The validity of the slightest question is emphatically denied.
Moreover, even if it come from a person of wisdom and experience and,
as far as the questioner can read his own conscience, it be sincere
and sympathetic, it tends to be labeled 'opposition.'
On the other hand, honest opposition is labeled 'persecution.'
Almost always criticism or doubt or even indifference is attributed to
'sin' on the part of the questioner &#8212; perhaps the rationalization
of some grave hidden weakness or the sin of jealousy or laziness or cowardice.<br>
<font face="Times,Roman" color="blue">
[Narcissistic inability to tolerate criticism;
lashing out in defiant counterattack.]<br></font>
<a name="trail_of_broken"> </a>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It is easy to understand why Mr. Buchman has always found it exceedingly
difficult to work with others except those who fully share his
convictions and acknowledge his leadership.
There were sharp disagreement and clash in his first position;
he resigned, harboring deep resentment against the committee which had
vetoed his policies.
There were acute difficulties at Hartford Seminary during his tenure
there. At various times he has been intimately associated with
important Christian leaders and movements as a colleague; almost
always the connection has finally been severed when his associates did not
completely accept his views or would not fully accede to his plans
for their work.
It is not clear that these sharp differences always centred on matters
of fundamental principle.

It is significant that Mr. Buchman's career
has left a trail of broken and raw relationships, of men and women
<a href="orange-cult_q8.html#cq_enemy" target="_blank">branded as enemies</a>
because they ventured to raise doubt about some
element in his programme or the infallibility of his judgement.<br>

And as harsh as all of that sounds, Henry P. van Dusen was actually writing a
balanced, if not sympathetic, analysis of Frank Buchman. Van Dusen also wrote:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
I doubt if there is a psychiatrist in the world whose intuitive sensitiveness
to
<font color="#9f0000">spiritual disease</font>
can begin to compare with his in acuteness and accuracy.
Years of unbroken concentration upon the inmost problems of personal
life have furnished him with unique powers of instantaneous and
piercing diagnosis.<br>
<font color="blue">
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>[Did you notice that
&quot;<a href="orange-cult_a0.html#spiritual_disease" target="_blank">spiritual disease</a>&quot; phrase?
Bill Wilson didn't invent that idea or terminology either.
He obviously got that jargon from Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group, too.]</i><br>
</font>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But to equipment forged by experience is undoubtedly added remarkable
inborn aptitude for character discernment. For Mr. Buchman is not only
a mystic; he is a psychic as well. Not infrequently, after two sentences
of causal conversation with a new acquaintance, he will suggest the presence
of secret difficulties which the other had been hiding from his most
intimate compansions, or even from himself.
When he enters a drawing-room, his rapier insight moves unnoticed from
person to person. Within five minutes he has formed his estimate of
every person in the room, fastening upon the inner keys to behavior
in each person's life -- all the while taking his part fully in the
inconsequential patter.
&nbsp; ...<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
No one who aims to take the measure of the man can afford to overlook this
extraordinary power. Occasionally he badly misses his guess, sometimes
with grossly impertinent accusations and unpardonable injustice to people's
character; but not often.
And, when he feels confident in his diagnosis, he does not hesitate to confront
the person with his failing or need, be he a peasant or prelate, statesman
or archbishop or Pullman porter, chance travelling companion or one of his
closest associates. But, his message does not stop with diagnosis.
In every instance, with equal assurance he prescribes the needed remedy --
however obscure or chronic the spiritual malady, however shackling the
other's defeat, however jaunty his self-confident exterior.<br>

So Buchman saw a room full of people
as just so many targets to be attacked and denounced as sinners?
There is a word for such a person -- <i>predator</i>. As the psychiatrists said,
<i>&quot;A narcissist is interpersonally exploitative.&quot;</i>

Like the manual on <i>Soul Surgery</i> taught:

unselfishness the other is breaking. Then challenge!<br>

I've heard preachers say that what was nice about Jesus Christ was that he
looked for, and spoke to, the goodness in people (like how he spoke to the
adulteress whom He saved from being stoned to death).
Obviously, Frank Buchman looked for and spoke to the bad in people.
<p>
And one does not have to be &quot;psychic&quot; to do that. A small inventory
of standard denunciations is quite sufficient to humiliate the majority of people because,
for the most part, people are pretty much the same.
For instance, Frank Buchman could, with a high degree of confidence,
accuse most young unmarried people of being too interested in sex &#8212; 
and that was in fact one of Frank Buchman's favorite accusations.
(As Buchman's slogan said, &quot;Crows are black the world over.&quot;)
Peter Howard reported Frank Buchman attacking one young woman:
</font>
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
[Frank Buchman] literally shook with the strength of his feelings.
&quot;I may have the wrong details,&quot; he said, &quot;but I have the right girl,
the right diagnosis and the right cure. You are the girl, the diagnosis
is that you are sex mad, the cure is Jesus Christ.&quot;<br>
</font>

<p>
But Frank Buchman's generic accusations did not always work:
<font color="#4f007f"><i>
&quot;Occasionally he badly misses his guess, sometimes with grossly
impertinent accusations and unpardonable injustice to people's character...&quot;
</i></font>
<p>
Van Dusen continued:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
The tides of history have swung to Mr. Buchman. <i>And</i> through all
those years he has never for one moment doubted God's appointed task for
him. To which the friend will retort with two questions:
'How came the tides of history to turn in that direction? Why has such
strange, almost fanatic, assurance borne such extraordinary fruit?'<br>

</blockquote>

Henry van Dusen wrote that in 1934, but eventually,
the &quot;tides of history&quot; turned and went out on
Frank Buchman, and his &quot;extraordinary fruit&quot; rotted and smelled
like the garbage left on a mud flat at low tide...
