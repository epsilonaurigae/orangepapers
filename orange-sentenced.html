There is a town in Massachusetts which is often showing up in Internet
searches of newspapers for people sentenced to A.A. meetings.
It is rather curious, to say the least.
Some judges there seem to regard A.A. as a real cure-all,
quite stubbornly ignoring the simple fact that
<a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">
A.A. has been declared a
religious organization by many higher courts</a>. It's unconstitutional
to sentence people to A.A., but those judges do it anyway.
<p>
Where neighboring Salem, Massachusetts once thought that everything bad
was caused by witches,
and could be fixed by hanging a bunch of women, now Westboro, Massachusetts has
some judges who seem to imagine that A.A. meetings will cure everything from
drunk driving to brutality, violence, intimidation, and child
pornography.
Do the judges imagine that just getting those nasty criminals praying will
somehow reform them?
Is this Faith-Based Punishment, Phase One?
(Are the judges themselves hidden A.A. members and 12-step true believers?)
<p>
Recent Westboro area cases where people were sentenced to Alcoholics Anonymous
include:

GRAFTON &#8212; Two teenagers charged with an armed robbery at a Worcester Street ice-cream stand pleaded not guilty in Westboro
District Court Friday.<br>
Scott J. B., 18, of Greaney Drive, and Paul J. L., 18, of Trinity Ave.,
were charged with armed robbery while
masked, assault with a dangerous weapon (a pellet gun), larceny over $250,
and assault and battery.<br>
They are charged with the July 27 armed robbery of Swirls and Scoops
Ice Cream Store. Both men allegedly entered the store while
masked, attacked the female owner as she was leaving the store and stole
approximately $2,000 in cash, according to a statement
released by Mr. Conte's office.<br>
Mr. B. is serving probation for a charge of driving under the influence
of alcohol. The case was closed July 8; and the charge
was continued without finding for one year. He was ordered to enroll
in an alcohol-awareness program as soon as possible and attend
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings until the awareness program begins.

Westboro District Court:<br>
A 62-year-old Randolph man who was charged with sending child pornography
by e-mail to a Shrewsbury woman pleaded guilty to possession of child
pornography yesterday. He was placed on probation and will be required
to move out of his home while a minor lives there.
He was also ordered to attend two Alcoholics Anonymous meetings per week
while on probation, use no drugs or
alcohol, and submit to drug and alcohol evaluations as necessary.
According to court records, the Shrewsbury woman was in a chat room
called &quot;I Like Older Men&quot; in February when she met a man who
steered the correspondence to sexual acts with young girls.
While she was exchanging the e-mails, the woman called the Shrewsbury police.
According to court records, the man gave the woman a wrong name, but
also gave his cell phone and work phone numbers, which police traced
to Mr. P.
The woman had said she received seven e-mails containing images of
children performing sexual acts.

There seem to be some judges around Worcester, Massachusetts who really
do believe that Alcoholics Anonymous is
<a href="orange-snake_oil.html" target="_blank">genuine snake oil</a> &#8212; a magic elixir
that can cure absolutely anything.
<p>
There also seem to be some judges who don't give a damn about what is
actually <a href="orange-spirrel.html#judges" target="_blank">legal or Constitutional</a>.

<p><br>
<font color="blue">
And another thought that is really disturbing is:<br>
If you go to an A.A. meeting for help with a drinking problem, the guy sitting next to you might
be one of those bad cops or vicious thugs or unconvicted murdering sexual predators
who was sentenced to A.A. meetings by a judge.

If A.A. really had any brains at all, they would immediately put a stop
to courts sentencing people to A.A., if only for the protection of the
sincere A.A. members,
and for the protection of the A.A. organization as a whole.
But A.A. doesn't have any brains...
<p>
The A.A. leadership can't see the stream of court-sentenced criminals as anything
but a bunch of potential new members, and they are all for it.
<a href="orange-bait-switch.html#promotion" target="_blank">They encourage it</a>.
</font>

<p><br><br><center><img src="http://orange-papers.info/coloredbar.gif"></center><p><br><br>

The official A.A. publication <i>&quot;The A.A. Grapevine&quot;</i>
continues to promote the idea of coerced A.A. attendance:

<p>
<blockquote>
<font face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
At the time of my accident, the deans were assessing how to respond to student
alcohol abuse and were waiting to try out their latest idea, Alcoholics Anonymous.
I was the test case. They told me in no uncertain terms that I would never get
back into this college unless I went to AA.<br>
</font>
<font size="-1">
<i>&quot;Window of Opportunity&quot;</i>, AA Grapevine, December 2001, page 39.
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
The author actually wrote that this was a happy story, a jolly good thing,
that the college administration had done him a
big favor by forcing him into Alcoholics Anonymous.
And, by implication, other universities should also do the same thing to their students.
Never mind the fact that the administration broke the law of the land
and violated that guy's civil rights by forcing him to attend the meetings of a cult religion.
(Not a smart thing for a university administration to do; it can lead to very expensive
lawsuits.)
And never mind the fact that as a treatment program for alcoholism,
Alcoholics Anonymous is a total failure.
<i>The AA Grapevine</i> thinks that coerced A.A. attendance is wonderful.

<p>
In fact,
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">the centerfold of the November 2002 issue of the <i>AA Grapevine</i></a>
showed that the vast majority of the A.A. members &#8212; 61% &#8212; had been &quot;introduced&quot; to
A.A. by pressure or coercion from the health care system or criminal justice system.
If the A.A. leadership were to put a stop to the coercive recruiting,
their membership would really shrink.
So they don't put a stop to it.

Story from United Press International

<p>
ALAMOSA, Colo., April 9 (UPI) &#8212; A woman found not guilty by reason of
insanity of killing her boyfriend and mutilating his body has been set
free in Alamosa, Colo.

<p>
Jane Lynn Woodry was deemed ready for a supervised return to society by
a judge after a two-hour hearing, the Rocky Mountain News reported Saturday.

<p>
Woodry was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1993 first-degree
murder of Peter Michael Greene. She shot him four times with a .25-caliber
revolver, dismembered his body, wrapped his torso in a blanket, and
stored it in a closet in his home.

<p>
She took his legs back to her apartment, where she cut hunks of flesh
from his legs. Investigators found bite-sized chunks of human flesh
prepared in a stew on the stove at Woodry's home.

<p>
Conditions for her release also include holding a job, attending
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, writing daily diary cards and a journal
for review by a social worker, and meeting with her case manager three
times a week.

<p>
&quot;I want people to know that the community is safe,&quot; Woodry
said. &quot;I am not a danger to the community.&quot;

So, if you go to an A.A. meeting in Colorado, you might discover that
the woman who is sitting next to you is a cannibal...

<p>
And once again, when was it established that either Alcoholics Anonymous
or the 12-Step cult religion reduces cannibalism in crazy women?

<p>
Or are they just using Alcoholics Anonymous as a free general-purpose baby-sitting service for psychopaths?
