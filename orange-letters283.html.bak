Wow.  Another Jew who claims not to be a Jew.  How original.  The first Jew giveaway
is the &quot;Donate Paypal&quot; button on your site.  Jews always beg for money &#8212; no matter
what. (Not a shred of dignity.)   That is a hallmark of the Jews' psychopathic
obsession with money.

<p>
Mr. Jew,  you are trying to denigrate and weaken Alcoholics Anonymous.  It is that
simple.  It is a very successful, popular, and powerful movement with millions of
followers, and that is a threat to the Zionist fantasy that Jews will rule the
world.  Although you have achieved a small measure of success, in the end you will
not succeed.  The beginning of your downfall is at hand.  The veil of illusion is
cracking.  You cannot win this race as time is not on your side.

<p>
While we Americans were sleeping &#8212; stupid and unaware as babies &#8212; your lying
scamming filth came crawling in the night to steal our country,  our freedoms, our
very lives.  (Yes, we know how you make fun of us naive, gullible Americans.)  We
trusted you and you have betrayed us.  Mr. Orange Jew, can you not feel the faint
sting of the backlash?  Can you not hear it whispering to you?

Hello again, Admin,
<p>
So you call everybody who disagrees with you &quot;a Jew&quot;? Wow. No wonder you are so paranoid.
That means that there are Jews in front of you, and Jews behind you, and Jews above you,
and Jews below you. And there are Jews on the left, and Jews on the right. You are hopelessly outnumbered.
<p>
And strangely enough, at the same time, you claim to be a regular American. I assure you that you are not.

<p>
(By the way, I'm actually a WASP. And I'm turning blond in my old age as my Swedish genes kick in.
Yes, I'm really part Aryan. And part Anglo-Saxon. And part Irish. But, unlike Adolf
Hitler, no Jewish blood.)

<p>
Your defense of Alcoholics Anonymous is just plain untrue. Alcoholics Anonymous
has not &quot;saved millions&quot; or &quot;helped millions&quot;.
Alcoholics Anonymous kills more people than it saves.
We've been through that again and again.
Look here for the actual A.A. failure rate:
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html" target="_blank">The Effectiveness of the Twelve-Step Treatment</a>

<p>
And if you dispute those numbers, would you care to tell us what the real A.A. success rate is?
Please answer this one simple question with some documented facts:
<p>
<center><table width="72%" border="6" bordercolor="blue" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">

Now what I want to know is, are you a member of Alcoholics Anonymous? You sure sound like one.
I just want to know for sure what the teenage kids are going to get exposed to when the judge sentences them
to A.A. meetings after they get busted driving home from a party buzzed.

Subject:  	brainwashed people<br>

<p>
Just wanted to say that i'm really enjoying your site. I had been in and out of aa
for about 10 years now and im finally done with it; after reading the book

&quot;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160709132751/http://www.morerevealed.com/library/coc/" target="_blank">The Real AA</a>&quot;

 as well as your site, I now have written evidence confirming what i came to
suspect: that staying sober/clean is about taking personal responsibility and
growing-up. The whole disease concept is like a crutch: although cult members like
to say &quot;You're not responsible for your disease, but you are responsible for your
recovery.&quot;
<p>
 What i hated about these brainwashed people is that any time a person did
anything good in life, the credit went to God. But if they did something bad, then
it was the individual (He took his will back). That makes absolutely no sense. Just
like if a person gets sober without going to AA, members say that person wasn't a
real alcoholic, regardless of all evidence to the contrary. And even if they
recognize somebody staying sober outside of AA, they assume that
the person is miserable. How arrogant is that?
<p>
 Last but not least, no horror story,
but i couldn't stand the standard answers from people when i had any issue in my
life: pray, ask God for help, call your sponsor. What a bunch of crap. Thanks for
telling the truth. Thoroughly.

Hello Joe,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and the thanks, and I'm glad to hear that the light bulb is on in your head.
<p>
Yes, this:
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;any time a person did anything good in life, the credit went to God. But if they did something bad, then
it was the individual&quot;</font>
is a con game. They are playing, &quot;Heads I win, tails you lose.&quot;
It's bad enough when a criminal uses that trick to cheat people out of their money, but using it to
cheat people out of their minds and their lives in unforgiveable.
<p>
And of course, claiming that somebody who quits drinking without A.A. wasn't &quot;a real alcoholic&quot; is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank">The Real Scotsman Fallacy</a>.
They try to pull that one on me too, often.
It's funny how they alternate between declaring that I'm just
a &quot;Dry Drunk with a Resentment&quot;, and then claiming
that I wasn't actually a real alcoholic at all, because I quit drinking without A.A.
<p>
Which leads to: &quot;Being miserable outside of A.A.&quot;. Ha. I'm enjoying life more than ever.
I'm not going to meetings every week and complaining to everybody in general about being unhappy, and
complaining about nearly getting &quot;triggered&quot;, and bemoaning
how hard it is to stay sober. Nope. I go to the beach
and lay in the sun and feed the goslings. (Well, I did during the summer. It's a little snowy right now.)

I just stumbled across your AA 12-sep bashing website.  I have only read a small
portion so far, mainly the 12 AA big secrets.  I cannot believe the garbage I have
read so far.   There are so many things you say there that aren't true that I don't

is so incredibly wrong and untrue. I am going to mention just a couple of things as
an example but trust me -there is much more.ure

You write:

<blockquote>

  &quot;Step Three teaches a lifestyle of infantile narcissism and passive
dependency, where A.A. members turn control of their wills
and their lives over to &quot;the care of God as we understood
Him&quot;, and then they expect God to take care of them and
run their lives for them, and solve all their problems,
and wait on them hand and foot,
and do all of the
hard work for them from then on...&quot;

will be amazed before we are halfway through. We are going to
know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the

word serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far down
the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can
benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will
disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain
interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole
attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and
of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know
how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly
realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.<br>

It sure is neat to have a Fairy Godmother with a Magic Wand.

Here is another one:  &quot;...forcing members to make lists of all of their sins and flaws,
and &quot;defects of character&quot; and &quot;moral shortcomings&quot;,
and confess
every intimate dirty little secret to another A.A. member who isn't
even ordained clergy, or even sworn to secrecy.&quot;t

<p>
First of all, nobody &quot;forces&quot;  a member to do anything.  AA gives suggestions and
advice.   There is no forcing of anything.  You seem to be referring to the 5th step
here where we admit to God and another human being the nature of  our wrongs.  This
can be said to ANYONE.  It doesn't have to be an AA sponsor or member.  It can
indeed be a minister, priest, a friend, counselor, or even a total stranger.   Nor
is it about telling every dirty little secret.  It about the things we did in the
past that causes us to carry around a lot of guilt and shame. It is about getting
all that off your back, psychologically speaking,  Once again, no one makes or
forces a member to do or say anything.

<p>
Do what I say, or die. <i>Work The Steps, OR Die!</i>  Some free choice.
<p>
And of course you are forgetting about all of the people who are sentenced to A.A. by a judge or
parole officer or probation officer or so-called &quot;counselor&quot; or &quot;therapist&quot;.
The Triennial Surveys have revealed that
<a href="orange-cult_a2.html#coercion_table" target="_blank">nearly two-thirds of
the membership were coerced, pressured, or forced into A.A.</a>

</font>
<p>
AA and the 12 steps are firstly about getting sober and the rest is getting into the
psychological and spiritual roots behind the alcohol abuse.  Many members chose to
see counselors and psychiatrists if they choose to. Abstaining from alcohol is just
the beginning.

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, the 12 Steps are about brainwashing new recruits into being true believer members of a cult religion.
That is what Dr. Frank Buchman developed those practices for, and that is what they still do.
Frank Buchman is also the man who called his cult practices &quot;spiritual principles&quot;.
Bill Wilson just copied all of that. (<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Look here</a>.)
</font>
<p>
The biggest lie you state is that AA is a cult.  There is nothing even remotely cult
like about AA.  To say there is is totally asinine.  Where do you get all this crap
from?  AA is a spiritual program not a religious one.  We have many members who
remain agnostics and even atheists!  Your higher power can be anything you chose.
For many the group itself is their higher power.  What pray tell is your definition
of a cult?  It obviously is different from mine and the meaning given in any
dictionary.  The Branch Davidians led by David Koresch was a cult as well as Heavens
Gate or Jim Jones and the People's Temple.  AA is not a cult and to even suggest it
is ludicrous.

<p>
<font color="blue">
You say that you have not read much of the web site yet. You should go read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test, and Alcoholics Anonymous as a Cult</a>.
Read the entire thing, both the questions and the answers.
A.A. is most assuredly a cult, just like lots of other cults.

</font>
<p>
Oh, and NO, step 11 is not about channelling God and getting psychic orders,  My
God, man.  Where are you getting this crap from?  None of this is true.  I have
never ever read such a distorted view of AA and the 12 steps as what is on your
website,  You have no idea what you are talking about,

<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, you are in denial. Of course Step 11 is about the occult practice of channeling.
Bill Wilson even bragged about all of the ghosts and evil spirits that he talked to.
Such &quot;receiving spiritual radiograms&quot; was another thing that Bill Wilson copied from
Dr. Frank Buchman's <i>Oxford Group</i> cult religion. (Heck, Bill Wilson copied everything
from the Oxford Group, or from other previous sobriety societies, but most of it came from the Oxford Group.)
<p>
Check out:

AA has helped milllions of people remaqin sober and continues  to do so.   That is
2why it is sttill around  It works IF you work it,

<p>
<font color="blue">
No, A.A. has not &quot;helped millions&quot;. That is the single biggest lie that A.A. tells.
The total worldwide A.A. membership is under two millions, and the vast majority of them will quit A.A.
without getting sober.
In fact, A.A. actually makes the problem worse.
When A.A. was properly tested,
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">Dr. Brandsma found that A.A. increased binge drinking</a>,
and
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Ditman" target="_blank">Dr. Ditman found that A.A. increased the rate of rearrests of alcoholics</a>,
and

<li>
And <a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">Dr. Vaillant found that A.A.
increased the death rate of alcoholics</a>. No other way of treating alcoholics produced as high a death rate.

</ol>
<p>
The slogan that &quot;It works if you work it&quot; is just another way of saying that A.A. does not really work  &#8212;
you have to do the work and then A.A. gets the credit.

Please excuse the many typos and errors in my message to you.  It is the middle of
the night and I am very tired.  I am also having problems with the laptop keyboard.

<p>
It is true that only a small percentage of those who try AA remain sober.  It is not
because the 12 steps and AA doesn't work &#8212; it is because they were not willing to
work it.  It is not easy and often very hard work. I speak from my own experience.
Millions of people haveThey would be appaled remained sober and turned their lives
around complelty and now lead happy productive lives. I see such people every day
and hear them speak.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Nope, now you are just trying another standard A.A. line to avoid responsibility for failure.
When somebody quits drinking, A.A. is eager to claim the credit, but when somebody does not
quit drinking, A.A. members complain that &quot;he didn't work the program right.&quot;
Baloney. If A.A. really worked, then there would be no need for excuses.
<p>
I can use the same faulty logic of A.A. to proclaim that eating vanilla ice cream is a never-fails
cure for alcoholism. And it makes people &quot;very spiritual&quot;, too:

<p>
<ol>
<li> My <i>Vanilla Ice Cream Program</i> requires people to always eat vanilla ice cream whenever they feel a desire
to drink alcohol. <b>Always eat ice cream; never drink alcohol!</b>
<li> NEVER have I seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed my path.
<li> When somebody just eats ice cream instead of drinks alcohol, that proves that my wonderful program really works.
<li> If somebody drinks alcohol, then he didn't follow my perfect Program, so it isn't my fault.
</ol>
<p>
A.A. uses the same intellectual dishonesty.

</font>
<p>
There is a woman named Heather who's story is one of the most harrowing I have ever
heard.  Her story involves sexual and physical abuse, rape, homelessness, alcoholism
and very serious mental health problems.  Because of AA she is not only sober today
and mentally healthy, she went back to school and got not only a Masters degree but
also a  Ph.D.  She now works as an addiction counselor.  Why doesn't your website
mention people like her?  And hers is just one out of hundreds, thousands, millions.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is the propaganda trick called
&quot;<a href="orange-propaganda.html#anecdote" target="_blank">Proof By Anecdote</a>&quot;</a>
 &#8212;  just tell a happy story that seems to prove your point.
One happy woman is not &quot;millions saved&quot; or &quot;millions helped&quot;.
And that story is not even proof that one woman was helped by A.A. practices.
<p>
When you say, that she is sober and healthy <font color="black">&quot;because of A.A.&quot;</font>,
you are making an assertion that is supported by no facts whatsoever.
You might as well claim that she recovered because she improved her diet and took vitamins and got some
fresh air and exercise. You are just
assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists. You are assuming that A.A. somehow healed her.
What evidence is there that A.A. actually did anything good for her?

<p>
And actually, I'd bet that the real reason she recovered is because she quit drinking alcohol,
not because she got fooled into attending the meetings of a religion.

</font>
<p>
You make it sound like AA has never helped anyone and even hurt and killed people!
<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes, A.A. has killed people.

You are so full of bull it is running out of your ears.  I have never ever seen so
much misinformation and lies before. You really have no idea what you are talking
about.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, so far, you have not presented any evidence that I am wrong.
You have tried a few propaganda tricks, but you have not presented any evidence that A.A. sobers up the alcoholics,
or helps them in any way.
</font>
<p>
 I tried getting myself sober without AA for a few decades,  I tried
everything under the sun.  Noing worked for me.  I finally had no options left but
to really work the AA program. Guess what?<br>
I have remained sober for several years now,  I know memkillsbers who have been
sober 20, 30 years and more.  I would love for you to hear some of the stories I
have &#8212; and they are success stories.
<p>
<font color="blue">
So you drank alcohol until you quit, and you drank too much for too long.
Welcome to the club. So did I. There is no evidence that you quit drinking
because you joined a dishonest religion.
<p>
I've heard plenty of A.A. success stories. Most of them ignore the simple fact that the person drank alcohol until
he was so sick that he just had to quit drinking, so he did. Doing the practices of an old
cult religion from the nineteen-thirties had nothing to do with it.

</font>
<p>
I really could go on and on about the garbage and lies on your website.
<p>
<font color="blue">

So far, you have not found one lie.
</font>
<p>

I have been in AA a number of years so I know what I am talking about.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is bad logic. Years in a cult do not make you an authority.
You could more accurately say, &quot;I've had several years of brainwashing in
the cult, so I'm really thoroughly indoctrinated now, and I will immediately deny any facts that contradict
my favorite beliefs.&quot;

</font>
<p>
So do the veterans of
the group who share their experience strength and hope in order to help others.
<p>
<font color="blue">
You  are just repeating cult slogans: &quot;Sharing experience strength and hope.&quot;
What you mean is, parrotting the standard dogma and repeating the slogans and misinformation.
</font>
<p>
We don't go around trying to recruit members into our &quot;cult.&quot;
<p>
<font color="blue">
Good grief! Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, is it?
What about Chapter 7 of the <i>Big Book</i>, which is the recruiting manual?

<p>
And then definitely check out the white-washed history of A.A. in the <i>Hallmark</i> made-for-TV fairy
tale called &quot;My Name Is Bill W.&quot;. While huge chunks of the history are totally wrong and
falsified and dishonest,
the movie did accurately show Bill Wilson and Doctor Bob immediately going recruiting in the hospitals
of Akron in the spring of 1935. As soon as they got together, they went recruiting.
<p>
What the movie did not show is the fact that Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob were really recruiting
alcoholics for
<a href="orange-rroot240.html" target="_blank">
 Dr. Frank Buchman's pro-Nazi <i>Oxford Group</i> cult religion</a>.
There was no &quot;Alcoholics Anonymous&quot; in existence in
1935, or 1936, or 1937. Bill and Bob were recruiting new victims for the Oxford Group,
where they would learn that Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler were really great lads.


</font>
<p>

I tried everything under
the sun for a few decades.to either control my drinking or abstain.  Nothing ever
worked.  I had no other options left but to really try my best to work the AA
program...And so far it has worked.
<p>
<font color="blue">
Again, that is bad logic. (It is
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#post_hoc" target="_blank"><i>Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc</i> &#8212;
&quot;It happened after 'X', so it was caused by 'X'&quot;</a>.)

That is like somebody declaring that he discovered that lucky rabbits' feet are
the cure for the nasty spiritual disease of &quot;bicycleism&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="green" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
&quot;When I was a child, I was never able to ride a bicycle.
I just couldn't do it. I fell down every time I tried.
I was <i>powerless over bicycles</i>. I just kept falling down.
<p>
Then one day, Jimmy loaned me his lucky rabbit's foot, and I succeeded in staying up. I didn't
fall down. That proves it: the rabbit's foot helped me to stay up on the bicycle.
<p>
Ergo: Lucky rabbits' feet make children able to ride bicycles.&quot;
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
Claims that the cult religion practices of A.A. somehow made people stop drinking alcohol are equally invalid.

</font>
<p>
Forcing someone into AA almost never works.
You have to want to do it yourself. 

<p>
<font color="blue">
Yes. YES!!! Thank you! You just declared that A.A. does not work. The alcoholics have to do the quitting themselves.
They have to want it for themselves, and then they have to do it for themselves.
A.A. cannot claim the credit for people quitting drinking. So much for the earlier claim that
A.A. has sobered up millions. A.A. hasn't sobered up anybody. People have to sober themselves up,
or they don't sober themselves up.
</font>
<p>

 If you could only hear some of the stories I
have and meet the members I have.  Your website makes it sound like AA has never
helped anybody.  That is a total lie.  You are clueless and your website is full of
crap that is not true a all.  Buddy I KNOW what AA and the 12 steps are about. I
KNOW what we do and teach and what we don't. So
do thousands of current members.  They would be as appalled at all your
misinformation and lies as I am.  You can think and believe what you want to.  We
know the truth.  You obviously don;t.  I don't know what planet  you are on but it
sure isn't the one I and most people are.  You seem to have no grasp or
understanding at all regarding AA and the 12 steps.  I was against AA for a long
time,  I eventually discovered how wrong I was about it.   If you truly feel that
you are correct about all the information on your site, then I strongly suggest you
run to your nearest psychiatrist as you are extremely delusional.

Subject:  	WTF???<br>

<p>
Sir Orange,

<p>
I have some many questions for you about this site and the whole, wtf???

<p>
<ul>
<li> 1. Are you a mudblup? If you don't know that o.k.
<li> 2. Why you not nice to ppl in alcoholics menomenous?
<li> 3. I always drank coffee at the meeting not snake oil. Do they drink that where you
come for?
<li> 4. You ever gone to the creation museum? It opens my eye to so many thins. They even
told me I was sinning for ever drinking all the stuff I use to.
<li> 5. I don't not believe the horror stores you have on your site. I think you make
them up.
<li> 6. Why does the AA have to prove it works? If it works it works and I work it I
worth it, but you can't say the same.
<li> 7. Why do you talk about lots other silly thins on yur site like Africa and Jews and
Commmandments and Cults and Buddists and Blue Footed Boobys?
<li> 8. Do you really thnk doctors will every listen to your stupid claims that cause to
harm to hurt people who leave AA?
<li> 9. Why don't you not believe ppl who say they got good sponsors? I got a good one
that tells me beer and licker are sins and drags my sorry ass to church on Sunday to
get my ass straitened out with my HP. They batised me three times already in a year.
And AA not against Christianism either. All the ppl in my AA are Christians.
<li> 10. Do you think the Fonz ever went to AA?
<li> 11. Why you think ppl drink if they can stop it all themself?
<li> 12. I in secret still like to take the drink which is while I wrote to you with a
unreal name, I don't not want my sponsor to find out. But what if the judge makes me
go to the stuff anyway? I for real don't no if I like AA or not but my sponsor said
you a bad man.
</ul>

<p>
I appologize for my bad writing. I want you to answer me and I hop you will. I am a
little and more than a little while I was writing this.

Hello Hagar,
<p>
Thank you for the letter and the questions.

<p>
And the answers are:

<ol>
<p><li>  No, I'm not a mudblup.

<p><li>  Actually, I am nice to people in Alcoholics Anonymous. I denounce the cult, not the people who are
its victims.

<p><li> 
I also drank coffee, not snake oil. Unfortunately, a lot of other people obviously drank the snake oil.
You could tell that from the crazy things that they said.

<p><li> 
No, I've never gone to a &quot;creation museum&quot;. That sounds like a real nightmare.

<p><li> 
No, I don't make up
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="_blank">the horror stories</a>.
My imagination isn't nearly good enough to do that.
If I could really just imagine all of that stuff, then I could make a lot of money writing scripts for Hollywood
horror movies.

<p><li>

Why you think ppl drink if they can stop it all themself
</font>
<p>
That is actually a big, complicated question, but I'll answer it as simply as I can:
People drink alcohol because they want to. They like how it feels.
When they do not quit drinking it, it's because they do not want to
quit drinking it. They can quit, but they don't want to.
<p>
Then, often, people get very, very sick from drinking too much alcohol, and then
they decide to quit. Then they do. Some people have to experiment and quit and backslide
a few times before they really decide to quit and stay quit.
<p>
And unfortunately, some other people never decide to quit drinking. They may say that they want
to quit, but they don't really want to quit. They just wish that the pain would stop so that they
could drink more. They are often the ones who die from alcohol.

<p><li> 
About you nibbling and having a few: I have no problem with that if it isn't a problem for you.
<p>
That is, are you one of the people who can &quot;just have a few&quot;, and then go to bed?
Or do you want to drink huge amounts once you get started? That is what determines whether you
should totally quit, or can just cut down and be moderate in your drinking.
<p>
Personally, I'm one of those people who never could be moderate. I can totally quit drinking and stay sober,
and have for the last 11 years, or I can drink myself to death, and I nearly did that too.
But I can't seem to just drink moderately and only have a few now and then.
I tried it for many years, and it never worked for me.
So now I just don't drink any alcohol at all, none whatsoever, and I'm fine with that.

<p>
But whether moderate drinking will work for you is another matter. People are different. There isn't any
one answer for everybody.
<p>
Lastly, no, I am not a bad man. I just believe in telling the truth. That makes some people very unhappy
 &#8212;  those people who don't want to hear the truth, that is.

<p>
Have a good day now.

Hello Orange.
<p>
Thank you for all the work that you do.  I read
your letters all the time, and it helps me with my new outlook on recovery which is
based upon Rational Recovery, and away from the cult practices of 12 steps
programs.  That being written, I know that you welcome all comments, debate and
criticisims to your page.  Overall I agree with you 100 percent on your view of AA,
and the need for people to find their own self to recover.  In
<a href="orange-letters281.html#Andrew_S" target="_blank">the letter 281 Andrew S. subject AA Problems</a>,
for the most part I agree to your case against him,
but I feel that he sort of made one minor point in his letter that I would like you
to clarify your position.
<p>
In the letter Adrew made the point that &quot;FDR and Winston
Churchill also gave people an illusory confidence because this
is the universal technique of nationhood and war.&quot;  You responded,

<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="blue" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">

I totally reject your argument. FDR and Winston Churchill
did not give people &quot;illusory confidence&quot;. Winston Churchill's &quot;Blood Sweat and
Tears&quot; speech is a masterpiece of public speaking, but there was nothing
illusory about it, was there? He wasn't lying to them and feeding them a load of
untrue cult propaganda. He was telling the truth. Churchill rallied the British
people and gave them hope and led them to victory. But he did not lie to them or
deceive them or give them &quot;illusory confidence&quot;.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
   Are you sugesting that FDR and
Churchill were not guilty of telling lies, and using fear and propaganda techniques?
When Britian Declared war on Germany, it did so allegedly to free the Polish People
becasue of the Naked agression that Germany displayed on Poland, however Stalin, who
occupied the other half of Poland was left unhindered in his conquest.  Also note
that Churchill had many Polish Nationals who were fighting in the allied army, and
were given personal promises by Churchill Himself that they would not be occupied by
the Russians after the war, but he lied to them, and even assured them that the
communist would not take over, even after the Yalta Confrence.
<p>
      Roosevelt was
also no angel.  He won the election in 1940 with the slogan &quot;He kept us out of war&quot;,
but based upon everything that we know about him he did everything in his power
behind the scenes to provoke a conflict with Germany to enter the war.  The oil
embargo against Japan was a major provocation.  There is much speculation as to what
Roosevelt knew in advance to Pearl Harbor, but what we do know is that he did
everything behind the curtains to get America involved in the war.
<p>
 How about
Roosevelts reference to Stalin as &quot;Uncle Joe&quot;, was this not Propaganda?  How come
the press never reported about the 7-20 million Ukranian and Russian Farmers who
starved to death in the Soviet  caused famines of the 1930's?  How come the press at
the time accused the Germans of killing all the officers of the Katyn Forest in
Poland, when the International Red cross knew without a shadow of a doubt that it
was a crime commited by our Communist Russian allies?
<p>
  What about the firebombing of
Dresden?   When the Nuclear bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, there is a radio Adress
given by Truman, declaring that the bomb was droped on a Military site.  Was this
not a lie?  How about the maps that showed how the Germans and the Japaneses were
going to invade South America, and then eventually overtake America?   Also note how
the Germans in the east who towards the end of the war that wanted to surrender to
Brittish and the Americans, but were forced to keep on fighting becasue of the
agreements that were made with Stalin.
<p>
          I hope that I am not taking your
words out of context, but you give this implication that Churchill and Roosevelt
were just swell guys, and almost angelic, but a case can be made that they were just
warmongering politicians who history is kind to becasue they were the victors.
<p>
Again, for the most part I agree with your comments, and your case against Adrew S,
but I feel that he does make a good point when he brings up Churchill for the
reasons that I outlined above.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Rational S.,
<p>
Thanks for the letter. You make a bunch of valid historical points. I didn't mean to imply
that Roosevelt and Churchill were angels. I especially agree about the
betrayal of the Polish people. That was unforgiveable and unjustifiable.
<p>
About the propaganda tricks, yes, they all did it,
although I think that the Nazi propaganda was far worse.  I mean, yes, all sides used racism and nationalism
to demonize the other side, but even the American hatred of the Japanese, and herding Japanese decendants
into concentration camps did not begin to match herding the Jews into Auschwitz and gassing them.
<p>
You are quite correct that the leaders on both sides lied and deceived. Sometimes, they felt that they
had to, for military security reasons. My favorite Roosevelt lie was, when he was asked about Jimmy Doolittle's
raid on Tokyo, Roosevelt told the newsmen that the bombers took off from Shangrila, a mythical land
in the Himalayas that was featured in a Broadway musical.
The lie was actually pointless, because the Japanese generals already knew where the American bombers
came from. They clearly recognized that the Americans did the same thing to them as the Japanese attack on
Pearl Harbor: launch bombers from aircraft carriers.
<p>
Still, the fact remains that the &quot;hope&quot; that Hitler gave the German people was false, and what Roosevelt
and Churchill gave their people was not. And it wasn't just a matter of who was lucky enough to win
the war. I was just reading a book about the fall of Berlin, the last days of the Third Reich.
The way that Hitler refused to be realistic, and refused to tell the truth to the German people,
and insisted on fighting to the last man and boy is incredible. Even in the very last
days, when anybody with half a brain could see that it was over, Hitler and Goebbels were going on
the radio and exhorting the German people to fight on (and die for Hitler). And they sent troops of
boy scouts (Hitlerjugend) out to fight against the Russian Army. You know what happened. So much for
&quot;hope&quot;.
<p>
The reason that I rejected Andrew's argument so strongly is because
Alcoholics Anonymous boosters often try to claim that A.A. produces some kind of wonderful &quot;placebo effect&quot;
that helps alcoholics to quit drinking. They claim that just giving the alcoholics &quot;hope&quot; makes them
quit drinking. In other words, feeding the alcoholics a lot of untrue fairy tales is good for them.
<p>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant" target="_blank">
Prof. Dr. George E. Vaillant</a> even went so far as to write in his book
<i>The Natural History of Alcoholism: Causes, Patterns, and Paths
to Recovery</i> that A.A. produced no improvement in the sobriety of alcoholics,
and it just produced an &quot;appalling&quot; death rate, but then he went on to
rave about the wonderful &quot;placebo effect&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
In other words, if we can but combine
the best placebo effects of acupuncture, Lourdes, or Christian Science
with the best attitude change inherent in the evangelical conversion
experience, we may be on our way to an effective alcoholism program.<br>
</font>
</blockquote>
<p>
That is sheer lunacy, and it did not work at all. It is simply amazing how easily Prof. Vaillant could switch
from declaring that A.A. produced nothing but failure and death to declaring that placebos will cure alcoholics.
And he simply ignored the fact that his own A.A.-based treatment program produced no beneficial placebo effects.

<p>
Back to Andrew's argument, these are the lines that I really objected to:
<p>
<blockquote>
<font color="black" face="Lucida,Utopia bold,Utopia,Helvetica,Charter,Arial,sans-serif,Sans Serif,New Century Schoolbook">
...they did not think of their message as illusory; they
probably thought that it was accurate, not illusory. That is
purposefully using vagueness to drag in some irrelevant people that
everybody hates.
<br>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Notice the hint that it is okay to foist untrue ineffective cult religion on sick
people because those disgusting alcoholics are just &quot;irrelevant people that
everybody hates.&quot;  It's okay to confuse those worthless alcoholics with
&quot;vagueness&quot; to get them to join the cult. That arrogant condescending
attitude of Alcoholics Anonymous really bugs me. A.A. claims to love the alcoholics,
but they don't.
<p>
Have a good day now.
