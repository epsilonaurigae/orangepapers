Good day Orange...

<p>
Thanx for being the voice of reason.

<p>
I have an interesting story about AA here in the Eugene/Springfield area of Oregon
that you might find interesting.  And it's all true.

<p>
A few years ago there was a big book study in a small town south of here called
Creswell.  The leader of the group was a man named Jerry S.
 This particular group was nicknamed &quot;Jerry's Kids&quot;.
I know him and he is/was revered in the circles of the fellowship, kind of like the
elders at Midtown and the Pacific Group.  The people he &quot;helped&quot; talked about
holding hands while kneeling and praying and studying the big book vigorously.
These guys recruited newcomers by going to the local detox-center and getting
sponsees.  And the same was expected of the newcomers. Recruit, recruit, recruit.
When I got clean and sober six years ago, I hooked up with an ex-sponsee of his
because I thought I &quot;wanted what he had&quot;.  Consequently, the guy I hooked up with
relapsed with 20+ years of sobriety.

<p>
About four years ago shockwaves erupted in the rooms when Jerry wound up marrying a
15 year old girl who came to meetings seeking recovery.  The sick part is he had to
get her parents' permission to marry her.  How's that for AA at its best?  And even
though his group disbanded, there are off-shoots of it meeting every week.   Anybody
who is active in the program here can verify what I've said.

<p>
I had enough about a year ago and called it quits.  You printed my previous letter
regarding that.

<p>
Keep up the good work...hopefully the tides of reason will eventually win out.

<p>
Sincerely... John S.

<p>

Hi John,
<p>
Thanks for the story. That's news to me. It just goes on and on and on... doesn't it?

Oh well, have a good day anyway.

Hi Orange,
<p>
Have you seen the series on CBS Paramount TV called &quot;The
Cleaner&quot;? It is about an ex-addict; supposedly a true story.
This guy
claims to have &quot;saved&quot; hundreds of addicts through illegal, extreme
interventions. He is not licensed or certified. He claims to have a
calling from God. He is of course involved in 12 step meetings. This is a
perfect example of the self-ordained gurus one finds in 12 step
meetings, really sick.

<font color="blue">
Hi Sherwood,
<p>
Thanks for the tip. No, I haven't seen it.
Funny that Paramount feels like glorifying a criminal.
And a self-proclaimed &quot;missionary from God&quot; passing himself off as an
expert on recovery (without any training or education)
is simply surreal. Although that is also exactly what
Bill Wilson did. And Mr. Wilson also claimed to have
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">a lot of fantastic successes</a>,
based on no valid evidence.

<p>
Most of that extreme &quot;intervention&quot; and &quot;deprogramming&quot;
stuff stopped back in the eighties when
the &quot;deprogrammers&quot; started going to prison for kidnapping and false
imprisonment, and also got sued for it, plus for torture and abuse.
Look at
<a href="orange-gulags.html#Miller_Newton" target="_blank">Rev. Miller Newton</a> and
<a href="orange-Tiebout.html#Talbott" target="_blank">Dr. G. Douglas Talbott</a>
for previous examples of &quot;tough-love&quot; torture programs.

<p>
There are a few notes on &quot;deprogramming&quot;  and &quot;confrontational therapy&quot;

Subject:  	Legal issues<br>

<p>
My wife just informed me yesterday that she wants a divorce, within hours after I
forwarded to her the information that I found on line from your web site, after
almost 5 years of marriage.  All of our assets are so comingled, that there is no
way for us to sort it out equitably.  In addition, I am 69 years old, gave up a job
opportunity for $250,000/yr. at her insistence that she would take care of me (one
of the main reasons that she was attracted to me was that I was retired, and thus
would be free for us to travel, which we had done for 5 years, extensively, in the
mid 1990's.)  My sole source of income is Social Security.

<p>
It seems obvious to me that the A A  program and its cult like tactics are a
contributing factor, if not the sole factor for reducing the hope for a
reconciliation with her.  I would like to proceed with a lawsuit against AA, but,
alas, I have no funds to hire a law firm who would have the resources to dig out all
of the information which you seem to already have.

<p>
I knew the head  of the printing operations for Oral Roberts and Oral Roberts
University while I was in Tulsa, OK back in the late 70's, and he explained how Oral
Roberts managed to garner so much wealth, i.e. he owned the printing operations from
which the Oral Roberts Foundation paid to have all of their &quot;free&quot; literature
printed for the Foundation.  This 'poor' printer of a 'charitable' foundation, drove
a new Cadillac and lived in a very nice area of Tulsa in a 6,000 sq. ft. house, not
including the space for the very large indoor swimming pool.  Mr. Roberts, on the
other hand, had a nice house.

<p>
Dealing with a tax-exempt/charitable organization, whose members are anonmyous, and
evidentally have a 'staff' of legal counselers, is, as you know, difficult to obtain
information and to proceed with a lawsuit, once one has the information.  It is
obvious to me that literature royalties are substantial, as Mrs. Wilson, according
to your information, received over $900,0000 in 1988 (?).  Another source of funds,
as I see it, must come from the 'trivial' collections at meetings, when one
considers roughly 2,000,000 members, attending a minimum of one meeting per week,
translates to a not so trivial $104,000,000/year.  That is in addition to donations,
bequeaths, and grants.

<p>
The only financials that I could find online was an Area 15 Delegates Report which
showed a Current Reserve Fund Value at December 31, 2005 of $9,982,857.  Link:<br>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162534/http://www.area15aa.org/M/Delegate_s_Corner/DelegateReport2006-04.doc" target="_blank">
http://www.area15aa.org/M/Delegate_s_Corner/DelegateReport2006-04.doc</a><br>
interesting
the &quot;Liabilities&quot;, i.e. mostly pensions and health benefits... that's for an
organization who is supposed to have a minimum of hired personnel.  That's just for
Area 15... I have no idea how many areas they have, and then there is the National
offices in New York City.  If you read the linked report, you'll note how their
concern focuses on increasing receipts.

<p>
I have been to enough AA meetings and Al-Anon meetings (And I can't believe that
they aren't connected, at least financially) to see the writing on the wall, and I
consider the tactics used by AA to be very harmful to people who, by their own
admission, &quot;powerless&quot;, and therefore vulnerable.

<p>
Do you have any ideas as to how I might proceed from this point?

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Roger T.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Roger,
<p>
I'm sorry to hear about your troubles.
<p>
About suing the A.A. organization:
My first impression is that the A.A. headquarters will declare that they had nothing
to do with it &#8212; that they never talked to your wife or counseled her to leave you
 &#8212; so you have no grounds to sue them.
They will claim that local people are responsible, if anybody is &#8212; the local people
who actually talked to your wife. And they will claim that they are not responsible
for what local A.A. members do. You know the slogan, &quot;Every group is independent, and
the headquarters has no power over them.&quot;
<p>
Then I would guess that the A.A. headquarters is unlikely to even admit
that any A.A. member anywhere ever gave bad advice &#8212; they will
claim that your problems with your wife have nothing to do with A.A. membership.
<p>
And it will be very difficult to prove otherwise.
Without local A.A. members hanging themselves by honestly testifying that they told your
wife to dump you because you aren't a good member of A.A., or because you criticized
A.A., I don't see how you can
collect evidence against them and have it stand up in a court of law. Hearsay isn't
good enough. All that they have to do is declare that they didn't tell your wife
to divorce you, and you can't prove that they did &#8212; not unless your wife is going to
take the stand and swear that they talked her into divorcing you, which seems
highly unlikely.
<p>
I hate to say it, but the case seems unwinnable. All that the other side needs to
establish is that you and your wife were having disagreements that weren't related to
A.A., and your case goes out the window. They will claim that the marriage was on
the rocks anyway, that she had stopped loving you,
and that she would have divorced you anyway, regardless of what some
A.A. members may have said. And you can't prove otherwise.

<p>
Indeed, you have to ask how committed she was to the marriage if she divorces you
just for criticizing Alcoholics Anonymous.

<p>
So the real question is to ask yourself if you wish to be with her any more. If so,
see whether reconciliation is even possible. If not, then figure out what to do with
the rest of your life.

<p>
Nevertheless, if you want to examine the A.A. financials, you can find the
<a href="orange-letters122.html#financials" target="_blank">financial reports here</a>.

<p>
I think that the donations are a lot less than that. First off, the &quot;2 million members&quot;
number is exaggerated, because they don't eliminate duplicates, and may well be lying
to hide the loss of members in recent years. And that 2 million number is what is supposed
to exist worldwide, not in the USA. It's just like Scientology or the
Moonies bragging about how many
members they have worldwide. You can't believe the numbers.
<p>
Then, most of the money put into the donations basket gets spent locally on rent,
coffee, give-away literature, and other expenses. I've had many A.A. members telling
me that their groups sent no money to the A.A. headquarters at all.
<p>
Who knows what they get in bequeaths and grants? It used to be customary
for the A.A. headquarters to turn down offers of &quot;outside donations&quot;,
but I think that they relaxed that &quot;tradition&quot; after they took over
$100,000 from the city of San Diego for holding a convention there.

<p>
Good luck. And have a good day.

Subject:<br>

<p>
Whatever your name is, I would like to thank you for your website.  I have been
familiar with A.A. since 2002, it was pushed on me by a classic old-timer, who I now
realize is completely NUTS, and has been for almost four decades.  I lost my
innocence around 5 years old, and pedophiles should get the death penalty.  I drank
to blackout as soon as I discovered it and still took care of business in every way,
until I took the A.A. bait. 
<p>
I was weak of mind at the time, not to mention too
young to know anything, and I could have been on the verge of, as you put it, sick
and tired of being sick and tired, and stopping what I was doing, but I tried a
meeting.  And then another.  On and off for three years. 
<p>
Something wasn't quite
right at the meetings, but if I were to say anything about it, they would
have cussed me out and told me to leave.  I was always the youngest at any meeting,
went to eight different groups, and got treated like DIRT, at every single one,
because I'm too young, haven't drank enough, never been married, never been
divorced, they've drank more liquor than I've pissed, etc. hey never mind that at
23, alcohol was the most important thing in my life, more than anything, even above
women. They didn't know that, but they wouldn't care anyway. I thought the only
requirement was an honest desire to quit drinking.  BULLSHIT
<p>
The more I learn about Bill Wilson, the more I want to punch him and the face of the
man that introduced me to A.A., because he truly worships him as a deity.  Bill
Wilson was not a man, he was an overgrown baby fortunate to have good genes and live
a long life.  Dr. Bob too, he fucked his daughter's life up, all of these people
are completely insane. 
<p>
A.A. tried to brainwash me in my weak state, and as I am
from a very small town, you cannot place much trust in anything being very
anonymous.  It finally ended me up in a treatment center, where they really ram it
down your throat, and I was truly wondering if I was insane. 
<p>
A.A. truly does make things worse for people. 
A good friend of mine that came from another state, 38,
married, good life ahead, changed noticeably after some dickhead gave him the Big
Book, he told me about it but I never told him what I knew about A.A., and he killed
himself last year.  What if he could have been one of the few that spontaneously
recovers? I maybe could have done something to prevent his wife and child from a
life of torment, but how will I ever know now?

<p>
As a footnote to the drastic
ineffectiveness of A.A. and the multitude of their recruiters in every single city
in the US, and how they all would have told me I was a hopeless loser alcoholic, I
made a decision to cast all ties to my old life, make it better, WITHOUT A.A., and
currently have over 4 years service in the United States Navy, I work to keep
submarines mission-ready every single day and the work I do, my name is legally
attached to that work for the life of the sub, if it fails, they put me in military
prison for life. 
<p>
If these idiots and their opinions were right, I should be dead
by now, but I MADE A CHOICE, all on my own, believe it or not, to stop destructive
behavior. 
<p>
Google SUBSAFE and you will see what I am talking about.  NASA even
asked the Navy for advice after the loss of the Columbia Space Shuttle in 2003. 
<p>
But let me go to an A.A. meeting and say that I'm a small part of the reason
the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf is not closed off by Iran, and you
can still get as much gasoline as you want, anytime you want, courtesy of the US
Navy with no thanks asked for, but I still like to have a few drinks, I'm condemned
to alcoholic death.   FUCK A.A.  I work hard, and I like to drink to relieve the
stress of this, but it's with coworkers instead of by myself now, I forget the exact
words in the Big Book, but wasn't it something like &quot;If you find another way, our
hats are off to you.&quot;  Yeah, they will be falling at your feet if you tell them you
have another way. 
<p>
I am 29 years old. I HAVE found another way through my own hard
work, and I will have a lifetime HATE of A.A. and how they sucker and
brainwash people, because not all are able to recognize what they are really getting
themselves into, and their lives are unneccessarily ruined by the CULT of A.A.
<p>
I only saw your website for the first time the other day, spent hours on it, but I
promise you I will read every word on it however many weeks or months it takes. 
You really have a good site.  I wish judges would force drunks to read this entire
site when they get in trouble, rather than making the problem worse.

<font color="blue">
Hi Nicholas,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the compliments. And I'm glad to hear that you are
doing well. And thanks for the cheap gasoline. All kidding aside, thank you for your service.


<p>
Yes, you have just proven one of the forbidden truths of Alcoholics Anonymous &#8212; 
that some alcoholics can and do just get over it and truly recover and become just like
normal people, including being able to drink just like normal people. In fact, they *do*
become &quot;normal people&quot;.  I guess it's normal for some normal people to drink too much
occasionally.

<p>
As you noticed, A.A. members can't stand to hear that.

<p>
Back in 1976,
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#Rand_Corp1" target="_blank">the famous think tank called
The Rand Corporation did a study</a>
of alcoholics that found that
half of the alcoholics who quit killing themselves with alcohol &#8212;
stopped &quot;self-destructive drinking&quot; &#8212; did it by absolutely
abstaining from drinking any alcohol,
but the other half of the successful people did it 
by tapering off into moderate controlled drinking.
<p>
So you turned out to be one of the people who can moderate, and I turned out to be
one of the people who has to absolutely abstain from alcohol. There's the 50-50 split.
So it goes.

<p>
When the Rand Corporation released the report of that study,
the A.A. true believers went ballistic and declared that the
authors of the study were killing alcoholics by &quot;giving them an excuse to drink.&quot;
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Rand_1739" target="_blank">See the story here</a>.
<p>
<a name="Ann_Landers"> </a>
Even
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html#Ann_Landers" target="_blank">Ann Landers got into the act</a>
and printed a reader's letter complaining that the
statement that some alcoholics can drink again was &quot;tantamount
to tossing a firebomb into a crowd at a football stadium.&quot;
(I really wonder whether Ann Landers was a secret member of Alcoholics Anonymous.
She spent a lot of years
promoting A.A. in her newspaper column, and declaring that A.A. was the greatest thing for people
with a drinking problem, and recommending A.A. for everybody who drank too much,
and parrotting the A.A. misinformation. I wonder why she did that.)
<p>
But the fact remains that
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Harvard_Mental" target="_blank">
lots of alcoholics do &quot;just get over it&quot;</a>.
A.A. responds by saying that
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;They weren't real alcoholics. If they were real
alcoholics they wouldn't be able to learn to drink moderately.&quot;</font>
(That's the
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#real_Scotsman" target="_blank">The Real Scotsman Logical Fallacy</a>.)
<p>
That, of course, immediately leads into a debate about the definition of &quot;alcoholic&quot;.
What is &quot;an alcoholic&quot;, really? How bad does it have to get for someone to
qualify as &quot;an alcoholic&quot;?

<p>
We've been over this before, but I guess it's time to reprint the definitions again:
<p>
<a name="alcoholic_defs"> </a>
<a name="definitions"> </a>
<blockquote>
A.A. uses at least four different definitions for the word &quot;alcoholic&quot;,
and gets them all mixed up, which really confuses the issue.
The definitions are:
<p>
<ol>
<li> An alcoholic is someone who habitually drinks far too much alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is someone who is hyper-sensitive to alcohol,
almost allergic to alcohol, perhaps a genetic alcoholic; someone who cannot drink
even one drink or his drinking will spin out of control and he will
become readdicted to alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is somebody who cannot quit drinking &#8212; he is &quot;powerless&quot; over alcohol.
<li> An alcoholic is
<a href="orange-us_stupid_drunks.html" target="_blank">
an insane sinner who is full of disgusting character defects</a> and
moral shortcomings and resentments and barely-contained anger,
and is a prime example of self-will run riot and
instincts run wild and selfishness and self-seeking and the Seven Deadly Sins,
although he doesn't think so...  etc., etc., ...
</ol>
<p>
When I call myself an alcoholic, I usually mean definition 2, and only occasionally
definition 1, but never definitions 3 or 4.
<p>
<ol>
<li> By definition 1, I stopped being an alcoholic more than 8 1/2 years ago.
<li> By definition 2, I will always be an alcoholic.
<li> By definition 3, I wasn't an alcoholic, because I could quit drinking, and I did.
I even quit drinking without any help from A.A., because I quit drinking two weeks before I
was ever
<a href="orange-intro.html" target="_blank">sent to an A.A. meeting</a>.
<li> By definition 4, I was never an alcoholic. I was always a nice drunk.
People liked having me at their parties because I was so much fun to have around
when I got high. (But, as one friend said, &quot;Even nice drunks die of
cirrhosis of the liver...&quot;)
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
So you go to A.A. and say that you've been having a problem with drinking a lot more
than you intended, and the next thing you know, they are telling you that you are
a sinner who has gotten too far away from God, and you are willful and selfish
and manipulative and dishonest and <i>in denial</i>, and not a nice person at all...
<p>
Oh well, have a good day anyway.

</center>
<p>
Here you can see just how similar these two goslings are. So how can I tell which is which?
Carmen's skull cap is darker, her cheek spot is larger and darker,
and her eye-shadow streaks are darker and go futher back.
And her back is a little darker. But you can see how the parents could have a very
hard time telling them apart.

</center>
<p>
Now here you can more easily see the differences between the two goslings. In particular, the gosling
on the right has a larger head, and its body is larger too.
It is almost certainly a boy. In that case, he will look less and
less like Carmen as he matures.

The beach scene &#8212; goslings everywhere.<br>
</center>
<p>
Many goose families come to this beach to hang out, graze the grassy
field, and get goodies from people.  On the left you see the &quot;family
of 9&quot;, and Carmen's family is in the upper right.
<p>
The &quot;family of 9&quot; is actually two families. Canada Geese often
form alliances where two couples pool their babies in a common nursery,
and care for them together.  That gives them four adults who can better
surround and protect the babies.  It gives them strength in numbers.
The Family of 9's baby count is either 6+3 or 7+2; I can never figure it out for sure
because one of the goslings likes to &quot;switch hit&quot;, and alternates between sets of parents.
<p>
By the way, you might notice the great difference in the sizes of some of the goslings.
There is nothing wrong with the little ones &#8212; they are just girls.  At this age, the boys
are rapidly turning into fat-assed little Sumo wrestlers, so that they can fight for their
place in the pecking order. The girls don't fight, so they stay slim and trim.
<p>
Look at the three wide-bottomed goslings in the lower center of the picture. They are boys.
And the smaller gosling immediately to their left is a girl.
As you can see, sometimes the boys get to be half again as large as the girls.

Dear Orange,

<p>
You have taken the article on surrender and misprinted it in order to fit YOUR
agenda.  Now you hide behind anonymity.  How ironic.  What do you have to say about
yourself?

Hello Scott,
<p>
That isn't very clear. Which article on surrender? And I didn't &quot;misprint&quot; anything.
I quote very carefully.

<p>
In general, demands for &quot;surrender of self&quot; are a standard cult feature.

question, and
<a href="orange-cult_a1.html#ca_surrender2cult" target="_blank">here</a> for the A.A. answer.

<p>
And I do not &quot;hide behind anonymity&quot;. It's funny that Alcoholics Anonymous
praises anonymity, and extolls it as a spiritual virtue, but when someone else
does it, you attack that as &quot;hiding&quot;.  Are all of you A.A. members &quot;hiding&quot;
behind anonymity?

But I guess you are against such anonymity and &quot;spirituality&quot;, right? &#8212; because
you call it &quot;hiding&quot;.


<p>
I broke my anonymity a while back, in response to many A.A. members' requests for many years.
My birth name is Terrance Hodgins, and I live in Portland, Oregon.
<p>
Now are you going to criticize me for breaking my anonymity? Are you going to accuse me of being

From:  	&quot;John C. S.&quot; <br>
Subject:  	Greetings from New Zealand<br>

<p>
Your website saved me from having to spend my retirement exposing AA.
Although I am 65, retirement is a long way off. June 2007 I became
reacquainted with a lady (my teen age sweetheart from 43 years ago). We live
in different towns but spent two lovely times together and spent much time
on phone and exchanging letters.

<p>
Very soon her membership of AA for 8 years became an issue (not because I
lacked empathy) but because her writings (I obviously had to be converted)
and the way she seemed to be controlled by a set of doubtful beliefs about
alcohol etc. made me suspicious of AA's modus operandi. I was &quot;bold&quot; enough
to state AA seemed to operate like a cult. In the 1980s my interest in
reading Theology included studying various cults (notably Romanism and
Seventh Day Adventism) as a result of the devastating effects they had
respectively had on my marriage and my siblings. I therefore recognize the
methodologies of cults. The perversions of Christianity are cultish as they
doctrinally or by implication threaten their believers with &quot;eternal death&quot;
if they depart the cult. AA threatens its believers with &quot;you will die&quot; if
they depart. That threat of death (eternally or in the here and now are
extremely controlling).

<p>
Noticed that the lady and I had considerable differences in our respective
approaches to basic nutrition.  My attempts to get her to consider a
&quot;nutrient dense diet&quot; as the way to overcome cravings (or the fear thereof)
went down like a lead balloon. Apart from being told she would get a local
(perhaps her sponsor) to &quot;sort me out&quot;, I was challenged to research AA
starting with the Big Book. Well that (research) is what I am in the habit
of doing anyway &#8212; so off to the public library. BB in reference section and
could not be borrowed but borrowed a book written by an AA sycophant plus
<a name="Edwards"> </a>
&quot;Alcohol &#8212; the world's favorite drug&quot; by Griffith Edwards, Emeritus
Professor of Addiction Behavior, University of London. A history of alcohol.
The most relevant information to me was the fact of AA having its origins in
Buchmanism (hence my hunch re cultish methodologies was being confirmed).
Edwards quotes the 12 steps &#8212; the first time I had read them. My immediate
reaction was they were a theological nonsense. By 14th July I had my own
copy of Edwards via Amazon USA

<p>
Add to that my attitude on the wisdom of controlling addictions via
&quot;nutrient dense nutrition&quot; and the friendship (apart from the occasional
exchange of texts, etc.) went on the wane. Until 2006 I just assumed AA was
benign. Also had thought of alcoholism as a disease having in 1967 or
thereabouts (when a Lion) listened to an address by a so-called expert (Dr.
Gerard Wall), then deputy Medical Superintendent of one of NZ's largest
psychiatric hospitals (Porirua). He later became an elected Member of the NZ
Parliament and later the Speaker.
<p>
Probably during 2003 I read on p221 of &quot;Nourishing Traditions&quot; by Sally
Fallon, a quote from Dr. Roger J Williams, former Director of the Clayton
Foundation Biochemical Institute, &quot;I will herewith positively assert that no
one who follows good nutritional practices will ever become an alcoholic&quot;.
<p>
Then
in 2006 the following letter appeared in the quarterly journal of the Weston
Price Foundation at
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162534/http://www.westonaprice.org/" target="_blank">www.westonaprice.org</a>:

<b>Traditional Diets for Rehabilitation</b>
</center>
<p>
I have begun a new job as a cook at The Canyon, a high-end
drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Malibu California. (The website is
www.thecyn.com.) It costs 36,000 dollars a month to stay there and it is
owned by Fred Segal, the fashion designer. Fred has been doing the primal
diet for several years now and wanted to implement some of it at the center,
namely raw dairy products and raw fish (sushi, ceviche, etc.). On our own
initiative, we have also begun to implement other healthy Weston Price food
practices such as sourdough bread, cooking with stock, all organic produce,
whey vinegar, raw ice cream, lard, etc. The results have been
phenomenal &#8212; everyone loves the food and most of the clients say that they
see a definite improvement in their health. Especially with the raw dairy
and fat, they say that it cuts drug and food cravings, makes their skin less
oily and fills them up quicker. In the past, I have had problems with
alcoholism, drug addiction and bulimia. Once I started implementing the
Weston Price diet in my life, especially tons of raw fat and raw dairy, I no
longer craved alcohol or drugs and no longer engaged in binge eating. I knew
that what had worked for me would also work for others and now I am
beginning to see the physical proof of that.

<p>
For many years I was partially led astray by the nutrition misinformation
followed in much of the &quot;western world&quot; based on the USDA healthy eating
pyramid.  I knew from my own experience since 2002 of the undoubted
advantages of following the &quot;nutrient dense nutrition&quot; advice of such as the
Weston Price Foundation. Until then I had been a &quot;carbohydrate addict&quot; and
had paid the price by suffering a detached retina (early sign of diabetes).
Since, following a diet high in natural Vitamin A, I have now abandoned
glasses and recently had my driving licence renewed deleting the requirement
to wear glasses.

<p>
<a name="seven_weeks"> </a>
From there it was books by Milam and Ketcham and then &quot;Seven Weeks To
Sobriety&quot; by Joan Mathews Larson via Amazon again. All dealt with the
nutritional approach although I felt the nutrition could be improved. Larson
is pretty good however and she deals with the hypoglycemia connection.
<p>
In
March 08 I obtained second hand from USA Roger Williams books published 1959
and 1981. The former he dedicates to AA but by 1981 he is becoming critical
of AA. Also had &quot;Mood Cure&quot; by Julia Ross and have no doubt it also
influenced my thinking.

<p>
Wondering what to write in October 2007 (in a final effort to reason with the
lady) I finally searched &quot;Buchmanism&quot; and up came &quot;Orange&quot;. Research already
done!! Much information then passed on to said lady (she being without
internet) and sad, but to be expected response from a &quot;cultist&quot; &#8212; attack the
messenger not the message. So over the last 18 months I have read all your
site and periodically the letters and replies. Have thought that to complete
the picture for those desirous of controlling their alcohol addiction (AA
having been thoroughly exposed as a fraud) that your site needed to cover
the nutritional approach. I know you offer other sources of help but they
also appear to be fellowships and counselling (albeit not of the detrimental
nature of AA).  If you look into Abram Hoffer (Orthomolecular Psychiatrist)
you will see he was the one who introduced Wilson to niacin treatment (there
is a clip on <i><b>Utube</b></i> plus Hoffer has written about it). It's a while since I
read your piece on B3 where you also disparaged (rightly so) experiments
with LSD but in the context of the times and Hoffer's training as a
psychiatrist and the fact he was the pioneer in trying to get away from
&quot;jawboning&quot; and psychotropic drugs it is not surprising that he was involved
in LSD experimentation. I was also aware from Sally Fallon's book that
Wilson had been attracted to niacin and when I first become interested in AA
in 2006 wondered what had happened to that interest and why lady was
unaware. Realised in due course that anything to do with nutrition was
rubbished by AA as irrelevant to the 12 steps.

<p>
A few months ago you received an email from Hypoglycemia Association in
Australia which dealt with the fact high proportion of the addicted were
hypo. Then just this week I have received book (Amazon again) &quot;Primal Body &#8212; 
Primal Mind&quot; (2009) by Nora Gedgaudas. Only reference to alcoholism is 5
paragraphs at pages 140-141 under the heading THE NEED FOR STEADY FUEL. I
quote (selectively, for sake of brevity).

<p>
<center><table width="88%" border="6" bordercolor="green" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
<font size="4" base="4" face="Times,Roman">

Where &quot;fueling the fire&quot; of our brain and body metabolism is concerned,
carbohydrates may best be described as &quot;kindling&quot;. Whole grains and legumes
are somewhat like &quot;twigs&quot;, starch, such as in cereals or potatoes, together
with simple sugars are like &quot;paper&quot; on the fire, and alcohol might best be
described as &quot;gasoline&quot; on the fire. If you're relying on carbohydrates as
your primary source of fuel, you need to fuel that fire often, regularly and
consistently. You will be craving that fuel. 

<p>
Most if not all alcoholics (for instance) have severe issues with
dysglycemia and sugar addiction. Alcoholics are utterly dependent upon and
regularly seek fast sources of sugar &#8212; alcohol being the fastest. This is
one reason why they say &quot;once an alcoholic always an alcoholic&quot;. This is
because the problem in alcoholism, in fact, isn't really alcohol per se &#8212; 
but severe carbohydrate addiction. The typical AA meeting is replete with
donuts, coffee and people standing around smoking cigarettes. Even though
they may not be drinking alcohol, the damaging, often unconscious, sugar
addiction in recovering alcoholics continues.   

<p>
Dietary fat, in the absence of carbohydrates, however, is like putting a
nice big &quot;log&quot; on the fire. Fat's flame burns at a regular even rate and is
easily kept going... Blood sugar &#8212; when one learns to depend on this steadier
source of fuel &#8212; becomes a trivial concern.
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
<p>
With both our nations being &quot;fat phobic&quot;, binge drinking is no mystery. At
first seemingly harmless good fun but as we well know there eventually comes
for too many the cross over point where malnutrition sets in and the
preferred fuel is alcohol and other stimulants. I am fortunate that my carb
addiction never progressed to preferring alcohol as my primary fuel but I
now live without any cravings for carbs and my health and physical
capabilities are much improved over the last 7 years. Hence no thoughts of
retiring from my physical work.

<p>
The same week I receive the Gedgaudas book
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160321162534/http://www.primalbody-primalmind.com/" target="_blank">www.PrimalBody-PrimalMind.com</a>)
I read letters on your site and realize you are both domiciled in Portland.
I suppose that is what finally prompted me to email you. In a city
approaching 600,000 (my city about 10% of that number) you may be unaware of
each other. The internet sure shrinks the world.

<p>
Kind regards

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello John,
<p>
Thanks for the letter and all of the information about nutrition. I agree that nutrition
is very important, and most alcoholics have terrible diets and malnutrition.
I know I did. I nearly lost my short-term memory from thiamine deficiency.
<p>
You remind me that I need to pay some more attention to my diet myself.
It could be better. At least I take a lot of vitamins and minerals.
They seem to help &#8212; especially the B vitamins. So twice a day, I take
<ol>
<li> one-a-day super everything, either Centrum Silver or the Safeway copy.
<li> high-potency B complex with C
<li> a large vitamin C
<li> calcium supplement
<li> aspirin, for prevention of headaches, and blood thinning
<li> 50 mg. DHEA. I don't know if this does anything, but I'm giving it a try.

</ol>
<p>
Since I take all of that twice a day, I'm getting double the usual dose.
<p>
Still, next I need to remember, &quot;More vegetables and salads... And more fruit, too.&quot;
<p>
Griffith Edwards is an interesting character. We have discussed his work a couple
of times before:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Orford" target="_blank">
A team of British researchers,
lead by Doctors Jim Orford and Griffith Edwards</a>,
tested the effectiveness of Alcoholics
Anonymous treatment of alcoholics in the biggest and most expensive test of
A.A. ever done in Great Britain, and they found A.A.-based treatment to
be completely useless and ineffective.

AA is a choice.  You can choose to be associated with AA or not.  For me, it

without a &quot;religious conversion&quot;.  Which, in turn, led me to
thinking about alcoholism, 12-steps, and AA.  A line I had read
somewhere else traveled from the deepest realms of my psyche at
light-speed to my consciousness, It rang out:  &quot;You were born
incontinent, too.&quot;
<p>
And some other voice in my head chimed in:
&quot;Yeah, how's that one going for you&quot;  Did you need a 12-step
program to keep you from shittin' in your pants&quot;&quot;
<p>
Well, my old
habit of keeping a running &quot;personal inventory&quot; has perhaps kept
me from sinning too gravely against the &quot;brotherhood&quot;.  I prayed
immediately for knowledge of &quot;His will&quot; and the power to carry
that out.
<p>
Just as immediately &quot;His will&quot; came to me.  It said:  &quot;You
are to be my chosen one for establishing Ala-Toddler.&quot;
<p>
It was very
clear to me the benefits Ala-Toddler would have.  Ala-Toddler would
fill the 12-step family indoctrination gap between the time one
begins to potty train and the time one becomes eligible for Ala-teen
indoctrination.  It would impress upon the 12-step family toddler, from the most
tender and pliable developmental age, the importance of
acknowledging the powerlessness their lives are enveloped in.  So, I
re-wrote the 12 steps for Ala-Toddler, to-wit:

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Admitted we were powerless over
shitting in our pants &#8212; that our lives had become nothing but one
steady succession from one shitty diaper to the next.

<p><li>
Came to believe that a Power
greater than ourselves could restore us to properly regulated butt-holes.

<p><li>
Made a decision to turn our
out-of-control butt-holes over to the care of God as we understood
him.
<p><li>
Made a searching and fearless
bowel movement inventory of ourselves.
<p><li>
Admitted to God, to ourselves, and
to another human being the exact nature of our failure to properly
control our butt-holes.
<p><li>
Were entirely ready to have God
remove all these bowel movement defects.
<p><li>
Humbly asked Him to remove our
bowel movement shortcomings.
<p><li>
Made a list of all persons we had
harmed, burdened, or inconvenienced with our inability to control
our bowels and became willing to make amends to them all.
<p><li>
Made direct amends to such people
whenever possible, except when to do so would cause them psychic
injury by forcing them to relive all the times they had to wipe our
filthy asses.
<p><li>
Continued to take a personal bowel
movement inventory and promptly admitted when our butt-holes were
either too tight or too loose, at inappropriate times.
<p><li>
Sought through prayer and
meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we
understood Him, praying only for the knowledge of His will for when
we should hold our butt-holes and when we should release our butt-holes, and the
power to carry that out.
<p><li>
Having had a spiritual anal sphincter
awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this
message to other potty-training infants, and their caregivers, and to
practice these principles in all our affairs.

Sorry to hear about your bad experience with AA. I have been sober in AA
for over 18 years and my life is wonderful. I pray you may find God in your
heart for Jesus loves us all. Rarely have we seen a person fail who has
thoroughly followed our path.

Thank you Jesus, Don S.

Hello Don,

What is at issue is not my experiences, but rather the experiences of the millions of

Subject:  	why<br>

<p>
Why trash something that is working to create a positive change in
someones life? I can understand someones unhappiness with 12 step
groups, but when some % (even if its a small one) is seeing profound
changes in the way they live their lives, why would you want to bash
that? I cant figure it out. I See the free tibet tag on the bottom of
the page and have to wonder if you have any idea what that stands for
and the simple ideas that are put forward there. They relate immensly
to 12 step groups. Im just curious.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Cody,
<p>
Thanks for the letter.
<p>
The big problem with A.A. is that it hurts far more people than it helps.
It is inaccurate and downright dishonest to just point to a small percentage
of the A.A. newcomers/inductees/recruits/parolees/prisoners/victims
who like A.A., and say that they are really happy, and claim that
A.A. really helped them, while pointedly ignoring all of the other people who were
not helped, or were even hurt, by Alcoholics Anonymous.
<p>
You have to look at both sides of Alcoholics Anonymous, not just listen to the happy
Pollyannas.  Read some of the horror stories of
people hurt by the A.A. organization. I just put together a short list of those stories,
<a href="orange-letters121.html#horror_stories" target="_blank">here</a>.
<p>
Also look at the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Brandsma" target="_blank">increased rate of binge drinking</a>
that A.A. causes,
and
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Vaillant_deaths" target="_blank">the elevated death rate</a>
that A.A. causes.
<p>
And look at the
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#AA_numbers" target="_blank">pathetically low
success rate</a> in getting people to quit drinking and stay quit.
A.A. doesn't really have a &quot;success rate&quot;; it's actually
<a href="orange-effectiveness.html#Bob_memorial" target="_blank">a bad failure rate</a>.
Even Bill Wilson said so, in one of his rare moments of candid honesty.

<p>
Oh, by the way, Tibetan Buddhist teachings are nothing like Alcoholics Anonymous, and the
Dalai Lama does not parrot the 12 Steps of
<a href="orange-rroot060.html" target="_blank">Frank Buchman</a> and
<a href="orange-rroot030.html" target="_blank">Bill Wilson</a>, nor does he
chant
<a href="orange-cult_a4.html#ca_thought_stop" target="_blank">all of those
mind-numbing A.A. slogans</a>.

<p>
Have a good day.

Subject:  	Freedom From The Cult<br>

<p>
Dear Orange,

<p>
I hope your internet situation clears up, soon.  Reading your
website and many of the letters people send to you really confirms
to me that I'm not the only one who has observed more harm than good
being done in the AA program.  I have been AA free for several years
and am still completely abstinent.  In fact, some very good
techniques that I have learned in an alternative program have
greatly helped me in not even having the desire to drink alcohol at
all any more as well.  I have come to realize that I am the one who
is in control of whether to drink or not and my abstinence is not at
the whim of some outside influence.  This also confirms to me that I
was (with all kidding aside) addicted to recovery group meetings,
which is no longer the case for me.  I'm glad to be out of that
cult.  Unfortunately, the after-effects of the vicious, dangerous
and destructive programming that was done to me in that cult still
haunt me at times, but they certainly do not at all give me the
desire to drink.
