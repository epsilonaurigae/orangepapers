Hi Terrance,
<p>
A few things..

<p>
1. I've just read a great book called &quot;SHAM: How the Self-Help Movement Made
America Helpless&quot; by Steve Salerno. It's a great book, another real eye
opener.
<p>
Also, orange-papers.info gets an honorable mention in the book as one of the
dissenting voices to the &quot;Recovery Movement&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hi again, &quot;iamnotastatistic&quot;,
<p>
Oh really? In the book? I'll have to check it out.
</font>
<p>
2. I was just thinking that if you want to use my previous email (9/21) on
your website you can, just delete my real name.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay.
</font>
<p>
3. I have a friend of mine, who's a PhD, analyzing the AA survey data right
now and within the next few weeks we should have a really clear picture of
the AA membership: membership growth curves, retention curves, total numbers
in their 1st year, median sobriety, short and long term efficacy, the
effects of the aging population in AA, etc., etc. All based on AA's own data
 &#8212; it's going to be interesting!

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh, now that sounds really interesting.

<p>
4. I've just read that our Drug Czar, Gil Kerlikowske, is a big fan of
*&quot;evidence based&quot;* treatment for addiction! Is there a major change on the way?
Apparently his son has been through the system so he may understand more
than most. It seems that the guy at the very, very top is not a fan of 12

Now that is a hopeful sign.

Subject:  	Re: Your web page (Chapter 24: The Last Hurrah: Up With People)<br>

<p>
Hello Orange,

<p>
Thank you for the considered reply. You're quite right; I only met
Frank Buchman once when I was very young and very impressionable. I
was struck by the fact that he talked to me as someone who could
understand what he was saying. And I noticed that he did so in the
presence of my father, grandfather and uncle and that they were also
impressed by that and did not exhibit any signs or reserve or
suspicion. I met Peter Howard many times when I was in my late teens
and looking for something better than what &quot;generic American society&quot;
was offering me; not only personal role models, which Peter never was,
but societal and systemic role models, for which his &quot;Design for
Dedication&quot; provided a possible alternative. Out of that, I spent the
summer of 1964 at Mackinac Island doing sets and electrics with the Up
with People show. So my knowledge and opinions are founded on that,
not on what Frank Buchman was like as a person or his personal
actions. Nor, actually, what Peter Howard was like as a person. I
never cared to investigate his past, choosing rather to evaluate how
consistently his actions matched his rhetoric which was much higher
than most adults of my experience and infinitely higher than any
politician or publicly elected official of my experience.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello again, Jeff,
<p>
I'm sure that the summer of 1964 was an interesting time for you.
</font>
<p>
I think most of my disagreement with you is over your repeated use of
the words &quot;cult&quot; and &quot;cult leader&quot;. These terms carry so much negative
baggage and have been so misused and abused that I object to their use
at all except in carefully defined &quot; and controlled &quot; circumstances,
which your website does not meet. While I acknowledge the use of the
words from a theological perspective, I restrict myself to using them
only in the sociological context and, for our conversation, request
you do the same. In my experience, Peter Howard's behavior did not
encompass all of the required elements for designation as a &quot;cult
leader&quot;.

<p>
<font color="blue">
The use of the word &quot;cult&quot; is quite deliberate, and is intended to have all of the negative
connotations. Frank Buchman and his Oxford Group/Moral Re-Armament are a classic textbook
example of a cult. You should read
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">The Cult Test</a>.
You can go right down the list, and Buchman's organization had most all of them, starting with
The Guru is Always Right, You are Always Wrong, No Graduates, No Exit, Cult-Speak, Irrational
Dogma, Denigration of Competing Churches, Lying and Deceiving, Grandiose Claims, Rewriting
History, and on and on.
</font>

<p>
My second disagreement with you is, I think, best characterized by the
quote, &quot;The evil men do lives on, while the good is oft interred with
their bones.&quot; I never cared enough about either Frank Buchman or Peter
Howard to research everything they ever did or said. I was (and still
am) only concerned with the ideas and philosophies they promoted. And
even there, not with all the variations they had explored but with the
specific ideas that were being promoted in the 1960s and 1970s.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Well, the ideas that they promoted were things like praise of Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler,
and claiming that all our problems would be solved if the world were ruled by Christian fascist
dictators. Then, when that didn't work out very well, they switched to promoting a generic
rabid &quot;patriotism&quot;, that included hatred of &quot;The Communists&quot;,
and attacking labor unions.
They were all for the War in Vietnam. 59,000 Americans killed. 2,000,000 Vietnamese dead.
Which led to the Cambodian War, and another 2,000,000 dead. 
</font>
<p>
In those days, the American presence on the world stage was dominated
by the violent expression of very un-American ideas. In 1956, after
public urging from the US government via VOA &amp; USIA, the Hungarian
people rebelled against the illegal Soviet takeover and control of
their country, gained a dominant position over the Soviet forces in
their country and invited, no, begged, the US government to honor its
promises and send diplomatic and military support to help them
maintain their freedom. To no avail. At the same time and throughout
the latter half of the 1950s and all of the 1960s, Robert McNamara (&amp;
others) was illegally sending mercenary and American military and
intelligence personnel into Southeast Asia in direct contravention of
formal and informal diplomatic accords with various people (e.g., Ho
Chi Minh) and countries (e.g., China, Laos, Viet Nam) in the area.
While my examples here are of foreign policy, there are similar
examples of un-American domestic policies. MRA and Design for
Dedication offered a foundation for a return to an official American
foreign and domestic policy that effectively expressed and supported
American values and ideals both at home and abroad. This was
tremendously exciting to many people in those days, myself included.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Buchman's right-wing politics did not improve the world scene at all.
Buchman was always screaming anti-Communist stuff, but he accomplished nothing.
His promotion of Hitler and the Nazis didn't accomplish anything either.
<p>
After Frank Buchman's praise of Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler didn't work out very well
during World War II,
Buchman switched to being &quot;very patriotic&quot;, and &quot;opposing Communism&quot;.
That is an easy scam. It doesn't take anything like spirituality or morals to
be &quot;against Communism&quot;. Lots of rabble-rousers have done it.
Buchman didn't accomplish anything good, and he probably had some influence
in shoving us into the distastrous War in Vietnam, and keeping us in it for 10 years.
<p>
Being in a cult is always &quot;terribly exciting&quot;, until you see through the fa&ccedil;ade.
That is how cults work. While ordinary people are &quot;just paying the rent&quot;,
and &quot;<a href="orange-rroot720.html#mere_existence" target="_blank">living pointless lives of mere existence</a>&quot;,
the
 <a href="orange-cult_q9.html#cq_grandiose" target="_blank">cult members are supposedly doing grand things,
achieving, accomplishing, building, saving the world</a>. Or so they say.
Yes, it's very exciting, as long as you believe in the story. It's like a fun movie, and
you are in it. Too bad reality has to
intrude, and you have to leave the theater after a while.

</font>
<p>
I have no quarrel you or others who call attention to the feet of clay
we all have. To do so is your right and I wouldn't take it from you if
I could. But I do wish that you would give just a little space on your
website, just a few words in your lecture, to those of us who found
something good and inspiring and chose to follow it. Even when our
leaders had feet of clay. It is a cold, cheerless world that requires
a person to lead a perfect life before we will allow him (or her) to
make a positive difference in the world. My God is not so repressive.
My God is willing to take the good wherever it may be found.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Excuse me, but the fact that you liked Frank Buchman's cult goes not
make it &quot;something good&quot;.  You chose to follow a dishonest
heretical cult religion. Sorry, but I am not going to praise that.

</font>
<p>
I don't know the hearts of my fellows in the Up With People cast at
Mackinac Island. Sometimes I'm not sure I know my own. But I do know I
was not there from any desire or intent to control or enslave or
diminish any other human being; to do &quot;what is right, as god gives us
to see the right&quot;. I do ask that you acknowledge that on your website.

<p>
<font color="blue">
I did not attack the cast of <i>Up With People</i>. I'm sure that they were some well-meaning,
hoodwinked kids, even if a little gullible and superstitious.
I can't blame those kids too much; they didn't know any better.
The cult managers are another matter, however.
They had an agenda, and they used the kids in their nefarious schemes.

Thank you for the letter. So, you met Frank Buchman and Peter Howard
for what, several fifteen-minute or one-hour conversations? And
because they were nice to you then, you have decided that they were
not dogmatic cult leaders? Do you really think that Frank Buchman
would reveal all of his worst characteristics to you in a short period
of time? He was a very skilled cult leader. He was good at fooling
people.
<p>
Cult leaders are usually clever and intelligent, and know how to
deceive and manipulate people. That is how they become successful cult
leaders, while less-skilled con artists fail to attract and hold a
following and build up a big cult. Being charismatic is also a big
plus for any cult leader.
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
Does this mean that you think that anyone who is charismatic and
clever and intelligent is a cult leader?
 I don't think that is what
you meant. Sociologists have a specific set of criteria, all of which
must be satisfied, for someone to be &quot;diagnosed&quot; as a cult leader. You
have not shown nor asserted that either Frank Buchman or Peter Howard
has displayed all of these criteria. This is my disagreement with what
you have posted on your website.

<p>
Nope, the logic is not reversible:
<ol>
<li> Most cult leaders are charismatic.
<li> But most charismatic people are not cult leaders.
</ol>
<p>
The reason that I mentioned &quot;charismatic&quot; is because you were fooled by a charismatic
cult leader.

<p>
Please point me to &quot;these sociologists&quot; who rate cult leaders. I have read a lot of
books about cults &#8212; see
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cult_biblio" target="_blank">the bibliography of this web site
for a long list of books about cults</a> &#8212;
and I have assembled a test to check whether any given group is a cult. Frank Buchman
and his Oxford Group passes the test easily. In fact, it is almost the gold standard.
The only things they didn't do is drink cyanide koolaid and shoot defectors.

Both Frank Buchman and Peter Howard most assuredly did make many
declarations like &quot;I have the one and only true way&quot; and &quot;you must do
what I tell you to&quot;. Have you actually bothered to read their books
and speeches, and see what they really said, and taught and promoted?
</font>
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>
I have read more than a little of Frank Buchman's writings and more of
Peter Howard's; one difference that I did find (more in FB's than PH's
perhaps because FB's covered most of his life while PH's spanned only
a few years) was that the message evolved. Possibly they were learning
as they went along? And I certainly believe that any set of such
principles may need to be revised and enhanced over time. E.g. the
original Constitution of the United States allowed for slavery of
human beings. I think you and I have very different interpretations of
what we have read.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Message evolved? Or they were just making it up as they went along?
&quot;The Message&quot; was that Frank Buchman listened to God, and God said that Adolf Hitler and
Heinrich Himmler were great fellows. But when that backfired, he just pretended that
it never happened. He changed the subject and became a rabid anti-Communist. That is
not &quot;a spiritual Message evolving&quot;. That is someone being an opportunist, and tailoring
his con to the mood of the times.
<p>
One of the problems with a con where someone claims that he is receiving infallible messages from God is that
he cannot admit that he was wrong.
That would mean either than 1) God was wrong, or 2) Frank Buchman did not hear God correctly.
No, no, no. Frank couldn't say that.
</font>
<p>
One key difference between Ghandi and Jim Jones or David Koresh is
that Ghandi never tried to force or coerce people to obey him. I think
it is different to say &quot;I have found some principles which, when
practiced, provide, e.g., &quot;a sure foundation for world peace&quot; and any
effective foundation for world peace must be based on these
principles.&quot; and &quot;I have the one and only true way.&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
It is true that Ghandi was non-violent, but what does that have to do with Frank Buchman?
<p>
Frank Buchman most assuredly DID NOT "find some principles". Doing occult practices
like conducting s&eacute;ances and "listening to God", and then praising Hitler and the Nazis
is not "spiritual principles".
<p>
You keep ignoring what actually happened, and reverting to repeating the same lines
about "spiritual principles", of which Frank Buchman had none.

</font>
<p>
Lest we be distracted into non-productive discussion, please let me
tell you that I am not an adherent of the Church of Rome (a.k.a. the
Roman Catholic Church) nor any of its derivatives (e.g., Lutheran,
Anglican, etc). Let me also tell you that there are many issues, e.g.,
homosexuality, where I have radically different opinions and positions
that FB or PH.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Okay. Actually, I never thought that you were a Catholic. And Lutheran or Anglican never
occurred to me either. What I saw was "Buchmanite". Buchmanism is a peculiar non-Christian
religion. In the last letter, I gave you a list of ways in which Frank Buchman was opposed to
the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Well, gee, didn't JFK say those who make peaceful change impossible
make violent change inevitable? This is classic rhetoric! You may have
even engaged in it once or twice yourself. 8^)

<p>
<font color="blue">
Huh? That is an irrelevant response. Your question was whether either Frank Buchman or
Peter Howard ever claimed to have &quot;the one and only way&quot;.
And the answer is, &quot;Yes, they did.&quot;
<p>
And JFK's rhetoric has nothing to do with Frank 
Buchman's cult religion. When Buchman said &quot;Guidance or Guns&quot;, what he was saying was,
<font color="#4f007f">
&quot;Everybody has to join my cult and do my occult practices, or there will be war.&quot;

<a name="Chamberlain"> </a>
<p>
Oh, come on. Many people were conned by Hitler (like maybe Neville
Chamberlain). Show me quotes of FB praising Hitler after the war and
my opinion will change. (Maybe there are some; I don't know.) My point
is that anything said about Hitler, Fascism and/or Communism before
WW2 has to be considered very differently from things said after the
war, after the Holocaust and the Gulag became public knowledge. (Oops,
there are still some who deny the Holocaust ever happened. Hmmm. P.S.
Not me.) Likewise, any statements of support for Communism must be
evaluated depending on whether they were made before or after the
operating practices of the various regimes became public knowledge.
(Of course, Communism, to my knowledge, has never been tried by any
country. What the Russians/Soviets tried should be called Leninism;
what the Chinese are still trying should be called Maoism. Both should
be approached with the highest degree of skepticism because both
spring from fascist roots {i.e., the Great Man theory of history /
governance; since both were started by one man ruling as autocrat}
while claiming to incorporate incompatible {with fascism}
philosophies, financial policies, economic models, social models,
legal models, etc.) In my opinion, it is reasonable to give &quot;the
benefit of the doubt&quot; to those who gave such support prior to public
disclosure, perhaps they actually believed Nazi / Communist
protestations of good faith. It appears to me that you give no weight
to the context in which a statement is made by those whose opinions
you dislike.

<p>
<font color="blue">
That is classic
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#minimize" target="_blank">Minimization and Denial</a>.
To claim that Frank Buchman was okay because he didn't publicly praise Adolf Hitler AFTER
the war? Really now.
<p>
Frank Buchman did not criticize Hitler and the Nazis during the war, either.
While Hitler was getting 50 million people killed, and Heinrich Himmler was
shoving the Jewish children into the gas chambers at Auschwitz, Frank Buchman
did not have one word of criticism for Adolf Hitler or Heinrich Himmler.
In fact, Frank Buchman was helping Europeans and U.S. citizens to
<a href="orange-rroot420.html" target="_blank">hide from the draft</a>
so that they wouldn't have to join the Army and fight against Hitler.
<p>
Then, I never heard Frank Buchman criticize Adolf Hitler after the war, either.
I have not found one speech where Frank Buchman publicly declared that Adolf Hitler
was a monster, and that he or God was wrong to have praised Adolf Hitler.
Have you?

<p>
And yes, Neville Chamberlain was foolish to allow himself to be deceived
by Hitler. And guess what?  Neville Chamberlain was listening to Frank Buchman's
advice. Yes,
<a href="orange-letters159.html#Chamberlain" target="_blank">Neville Chamberlain was a member of
Frank Buchman's Oxford Group/Moral Re-Armament organization</a>,
and he was listening to Frank Buchman raving about how
<font color="black">
&quot;I thank Heaven for a man like Adolf Hitler...&quot;</font>. 
<p>
Again, Buchman claimed to be listening to God. How could he get it so wrong if he was really
listening to God? Or were his spiritual teachings just a big fraud?
<p>
Other people can explain that they have changed their minds about things
after a big war, but not someone who claims that he is getting his
doctrines straight from God. What, did God not know what Hitler was
really like?
<p>
And again, your argument about &quot;the context&quot; is irrelevant. 
God is allegedly not fooled by &quot;contexts&quot;. Frank Buchman claimed 
to be listening to God, not to the ill-informed people on the street.
Buchman claimed to be repeating messages from God, not just giving his own
private, error-prone opinions.  
<p>
Furthermore, &quot;the context&quot; was that the average American hated Adolf Hitler.
It wasn't like Frank Buchman had to praise Adolf Hitler in order to please the public,
or to conform to the spirit of the times.
It wasn't like the mob in the streets was screaming the praises of Adolf Hitler.
The few people who loved Hitler in the USA and
Great Britain were mostly just the millionaires and nobility, who feared
that a rising tide of socialism would take away their wealth and status.

Whoa! Now, you're just being silly and insulting. Everyone who
believes there is a God believes they know something about what God's
Will is. Whether they live by it or not. Whether they are correct in

<font color="blue">
No, I'm not being silly and insulting.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#guidance" target="_blank">&quot;Listening to God&quot;
was the heart of Frank Buchman's religion</a>.
Furthermore, Buchman claimed that his &quot;Guidance from God&quot; was
<i>infallible</i>. That is arrogance.
<p>
Regular people who have religious beliefs do not usually claim to be getting infallible messages
straight from God, and carrying on a conversation with God all day long.
Those who do are usually referred to a psychiatrist.

<p>
Whether or not you, Orange, believe there is a God, you obviously
believe you know something about what is the right way for people to
live. Should I chastise you for arrogance? Furthermore, since you were
not present on any of the occasions when I spoke with FB or PH, how
would you know whether they did or did not &quot;display humility at all&quot;&quot;

<p>
<font color="blue">
Oh Jeez Louise. Can you read? Frank Buchman claimed to have a
 hotline straight to God, and claimed that
he could hear the Voice of God, and that other people could not hear God as well as he could.
And now you cannot figure out whether the man was &quot;displaying humility&quot; or arrogance?
You claim that somebody has to be present and see Buchman speak to be able to figure it out?
Really now.  That borders on
<a href="orange-propaganda.html#obtuse" target="_blank">intentional obtuseness</a>.
<p>
As far as me knowing &quot;what is the right way for people to
live&quot; being arrogant, I can confidently tell you that lying in the name of God is not
the right way for people to live. Yes, that is a religious belief that I hold.
If you want to call that arrogant, go ahead. But then please explain
to me how it really is okay to lie to people in the name of God.

And the Nazi thing was just the tip of the iceberg. Frank Buchman and Peter Howard spent
their lives promoting a heretical unChristian cult religion while pretending that they
were talking to God and practicing Christianity.
<ul>
<p><li>
While Jesus Christ said, &quot;Help the poor, feed the hungry, clothe the naked,&quot;
Frank Buchman
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#no_charity" target="_blank">refused to give out a penny in charity</a>, and
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#fur_coats" target="_blank">attacked those who said that he should</a>.

<p><li>
While Christ said, &quot;It will be easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into Heaven,&quot;
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#fur_coats" target="_blank">Buchman
said, &quot;There is no difference between the rich and the poor,&quot;</a>
 and
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#Astoria" target="_blank">Buchman
lived in royal splendor in the Waldorf-Astoria
and the Mayfair Hotels</a>.

<p><li>
While Christ said, &quot;Do not be like the Pharisees. Do not seek signs.
Do not demand to see miracles,&quot; Buchman said,
&quot;<a href="orange-rroot090.html#coincidences" target="_blank">Seek signs. Look at
coincidences as signs</a>. Listen for voices in your Quiet Time.&quot;

<p><li>
Where Christ declared, &quot;Learn the truth, and the truth shall set you free,&quot;
Buchman hypocritically lied like a rug while yammering about &quot;Absolute Honesty&quot;,
and declaring that
<a href="orange-rroot240.html#living_spirit" target="_blank">everybody has to be a slave
of a dictator</a>.

<p><li>
Jesus Christ taught that people should be responsible for their behavior, and
refrain from doing evil, and actively work at doing good. Frank Buchman taught that
people were &quot;defeated by sin&quot;, and had to surrender control
of their lives to &quot;<i>God</i>&quot;,
and let that &quot;<i>God</i>&quot; tell them what to do.
Even worse, Frank Buchman then declaired that the common people could
not hear the voice of God correctly, so
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#check_guidance" target="_blank">they had to &quot;check Guidance&quot;</a>
with their sponsor or other Group elders, so
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#paradox" target="_blank">the Oxford Group leaders
usurped the authority of God</a>,
and they, not God, ended up telling the rank and file members what to do,
and what God supposedly said.
Upon what authority did Frank Buchman declare that
<a href="orange-rroot270.html#Gods_mind" target="_blank">he knew God's will and God's plan</a>?
That is the height of arrogance.


<p><li>
&#8212; Which brings up, there is nothing in the Bible that says that
you can just &quot;surrender to God&quot;, and God will then &quot;Guide&quot;
you and make you into a well-behaved puppet who is &quot;under God-control&quot;
all of the time.
<a href="orange-rroot090.html#authority" target="_blank">
As Marjorie Harrison declared</a>:
<font color="black">
&quot;Dr. Buchman has no authority whatever for his doctrine
of direct guidance available at any moment.&quot;
</font>


<p><li>
The Biblical statement is, &quot;Thou shalt earn thy bread by the sweat of thy brow&quot;,
but
Frank Buchman believed in getting his bread by the sweat of other people's brows.
<a href="orange-rroot210.html#sweat" target="_blank">
Buchman taught his followers to live off of contributors' donations: &quot;Where God Guides,
God Provides.&quot;</a>
And of course that meant that Buchman did not believe in sharing the wealth. While
Frank Buchman
lived in first-class luxury, his followers had to scrounge donations for themselves, or
starve.

</ul>
<p>
And it just goes on and on. Frank Buchman was not guided by God.
I will leave it to others to decide whether Buchman was Guided by Satan, or just guided
by his own evil impulses.
<p>
You know, Jeff, the day that you met Frank Buchman might be the day that you came as
close to the Devil as you are ever going to come in this lifetime.

<p>
I am wondering who you are that you know so much on this subject, more so than
anyone I have come across.

<p>
<font color="blue">
Hello Paul,
<p>
Thanks for the compliment. &quot;Who I am&quot; is a complicated question. I am many things,
ranging from an old hippie from the commune, to an ex-computer programmer,
to an ex-alcoholic.
<p>
I just got interested in cults from exposure to them. I met and hung out with a bunch of
cults back in the 'sixties and 'seventies, and did not know that they were cults at the
time. I learned that many years later, when they failed and blew up. Fortunately, I never
really joined one and gave it my brain. I would get the feeling that something was a little
bit off, not quite right, and walk on down the street. Then years later I would learn the whole
story about them.
<p>
When I began going to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, I quickly saw
that they were just like the goofy cults that I had been visiting
back in the 'sixties and 'seventies.
<p>
When I was writing up the web pages for the Orange Papers, I decided that I needed
<a href="orange-cult.html" target="_blank">a decent cult test</a>
to back up the statement that A.A. and N.A. are cults. So I started reading
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#cult_biblio" target="_blank">a heck of a lot of books about cults</a>,
and doing other research too.
One thing led to another, and I've been at it for ten years now.

<p>
I have answered the question of &quot;who are you&quot; many times before, so I'll point you to
some of the lists of answers.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="orange-letters167.html#who_r_u" target="newwin59">Who are you?</a>
This includes personal history, and starts with going to a quack

Hello Jessica,
<p>
Thank you for the letter, and I'm sorry to hear about your problems.
You are asking one of the toughest questions: &quot;How to get somebody to quit a cult?&quot;
<p>
My first reaction is, &quot;You can't.&quot; But maybe that is a little too pessimistic.
<p>
The truth is, a cult member has to decide for himself or herself to quit the cult.
We can try to tell them the truth, and try to convince them that they are being
hoodwinked, but as long as a cult member believes that the cult is making them happy
and doing good things for them, it is extremely difficult to get them to quit the cult.
They will just reject all negative information about the cult, and keep on insisting
that the cult is wonderful.
<p>
I am reminded of a book by Steve Hassan, called
<a href="orange-bibliography.html#RTB" target="_blank">
<i>Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves</i></a>.
It is about how to get a loved one out of a cult.
In it, Hassan describes a number of techniques for working on a cult member,
like criticize some other cult that resembles your friend's cult, and let him
&quot;connect the dots&quot; himself.
<p>
We discussed some things from Hassan's book at length in earlier letters, and also
the question of how to get somebody out of a cult:

Subject:  	AA<br>

<p>
Dear Orange
<p>
I came accross your website tonight and I feel a huge sense of relief because for
many years (14 Years) to be exact I have struggled with AA. i feel extremely
emotional but yet relieved that I have found your site.
<p>
I read quite a lot of the letters and the problems that occured with your AOL
account and I am pleased to know now I am not on my own.
<p>
When I go to AA I feel like my skin is crawling, and because I dont share in AA I
get judged and then I am told I am not working my program.  I ended up going to see
a counsellor and she said maybe your time is up in AA. I feel like crying as I am so
lost and in some way have made AA my life in many ways.... I attract people in AA who
I know deep down feel the same way I do but are not honest enought to express
themseves. Orange is there anything you can recommend for me to get the hell out of
AA... i feel like I have been in a Cult and I know and want to leave.. I have a
commitment on a Saturday and really dont want to go back... I need help.. do you have
an online forum where I can talk to and hopefully get help to get the hell out this
hell hole that I am in....
<p>
I hope you can reply, I know you are busy but I would etrenally grateful if you can
sugest to me what to do.
<p>
Kind Regards<br>
Michele (TIRED OF BEING IN A CULT AND WANT OUT NOW)

Hello Michele,
<p>
Thanks for the letter, and congratulations on your awakening. I am reminded of that 
old line, 
&quot;You have just learned something my dear, although right now it feels like you have just lost
something.&quot;
<p>
You want out of the cult, but
<a href="orange-cult_a3.html#ca_phobias" target="_blank">the phobias that they induced in you</a>
make you afraid to leave. That is normal.
